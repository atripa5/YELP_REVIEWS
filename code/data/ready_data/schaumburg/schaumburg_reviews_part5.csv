Once I tried a natural bubbly energy drink from a can and threw it out because it was close to the most disgusting drink I ever had. 

Also, Lifecafe should install an exhaust hood fan to vent outdoors above the oven.  It would help the gym not smell like food!  Currently, the air circulation system grabs the food smells and pumps it throughout the club."

I decided to give this place a 3 star. I decided to go out with my fiancée and do a groupon lunch. There were two offers. 40.00 value for 4 or 20.00 value for 2. Obviously we took the second.

Pros...

1. The waitress was great. Very friendly and smiling all the time. She was also the bartender. There weren&#39;t many people there so she was doing the double duty of waitressing and bartending between us and a couple sitting at the bar.

2. My fiancée ordered a tuna salad sandwich and corn on the cob with chili spices. Meanwhile I had fish and chips (i.e. fish and fries). It&#39;s a Catholic city so many bars will have fish and chips in the Chicago area. The food was really good, warm, and they give you big portions.

3. Menu had many options. For some reason they had a lot of Mexican food options. Not bad.

Cons...

1. As much as I like hole in the walls, this place did look like it needs some serious updating. Walls were drabby, out of date furniture, etc. I sort of felt like it was a bar from the 80&#39;s. It did look like it was rundown. It was very dark inside on a very sunny day. However they did say they will have a patio in a few weeks outside.

2. We waited like 20 minutes to 30 minutes for our food. I think there was only one person in the kitchen. To give a benefit of the doubt, it was dead time so they probably saved money since they they were not expecting us. 

My fiancée and I decided that we will most likely not come back. 

Conclusion...
Good place to grab a quick food. Somewhat inexpensive. It was worth the groupon deal we had so go ahead the first time and the judge yourself. I would rather go to Bdubs then here, but still not a bad place."

I am NOT a drinker, so the only thing I can rate is food, service, and atmosphere.

Food: 3/5
The menu at Ceasars is pretty extensive, and about what you&#39;d expect from a bar, and then some. Their Mexican food is tolerable for what it is, but not, by any means, a &#34;home run&#34;. I haven&#39;t had anything but the Mexican food. Do not get the fish taco.

Service: 1/5
The service here is slower than a boat on land. Servers are nice and friendly, but I&#39;ve waited for up to 45 minutes for food. On top of that, last time I was there (March 2016), they were having trouble with their card machines.

If you&#39;re wanting entrees relatively quick, pick another place.

Atmosphere: 3/5
Atmosphere is pretty normal for what you&#39;d expect at a sports bar, no Mexican decor at all, which doesn&#39;t really matter to me. Can get crowded pretty quickly, I would not suggest groups unless you&#39;re sitting near the front. Also, it gets loud by the speakers on karaoke nights.

- - - - - - - - -

All-in-All, If you&#39;re looking for better, faster Mexican food in the area, drive a little bit further east on Lake st to El Burrito Tapatio, or west, to El Burrito Fantastico. If you&#39;re looking for a slow time with a reasonable bar atmosphere, go to Ceasar&#39;s

Still a fair price for what you are getting.

One of my slight beefs with the place right now is the prices of draft beer. You never know how much you are going to pay each day. Every day and every week seems to be different. Miller Lite on one day can cost $1.00. The next day it could be $3.00. The next day the same draft beer can cost $4.00. If you want Blue Moon it can cost you $3.00 one day, $4.00 the next day and on Sunday it will cost you $6.00. I find the prices to be the highest on Sunday. Stopped going on Sundays because of that. 

It still is a fun place to watch hockey and football games. They have satellite TV so they can pick up just about every football game you want. Very good picture quality on their TV&#39;s.  Almost everyone in the place seems to carry on a conversation with you unlike a lot of places. A friendly local bar with friendly customers.

The tacos and chips and salsa (could be a little more hotter) are really good IMO. I am not a big fan of much else on their menu. The gyros are OK but I have had better at other places. I prefer the spicy version. The steak fajitas were not as good as I had hoped. The nachos are pretty much chips, steak, a little cheese, sour cream and guacamole. I would like to see more cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. Personally I would like to see the wings with either no breading or their own homemade breading. None of this pre made packaged stuff.  But then what do you want for .60 ea.

The hamburgers are frozen patties. Not my preference. They do offer a grass fed beef hamburger (not on the menu) that is pretty good. The fries w/ the grass fed beefburger are suppose to be organic. You have to ask and see if they have it in stock.

Still one of the the best local friendly places in the Bloomingdale area."

Only 9 reviews and 3  1/2 stars, surely something was amiss. Come on Yelpers we can do better than that! Then as I read them I began to see the trend. An issue with having staff during peak times is apparent. I get it and totally understand. My coworkers and I had a night where our drinks kept going cold on a Friday night because Marisol had gone on break. So chances are that if you had a good server it was Marisol. 

For those wary of checking Cesar&#39;s out, be aware that Cesar has hired more staff (I met a new girl this afternoon that was super friendly though so I remain hopeful). Clearly this hiring issue is something that any new-er business will experience growing pains over. Especially as word spreads and they get busier for the night crowd. 

I have found that Cesar&#39;s has an A*mazing lunch special menu--tacos, burgers, wings at a decent price. They should be much busier during the lunch hours than they are. The menu doesn&#39;t need to be so large when they make such amazing chicken tacos. Perhaps I should talk to Cesar about this. Don&#39;t get me wrong, when you are hungry you are...HUNGRY! (((GIVE ME MY FOOD NOW))) As for the margaritas, I admit that they are definitely a bit on the strong side and perhaps should be saved for a night out before a weekend (if you can finish more than 1 I&#39;d be impressed). However, among all of these things Cesar&#39;s has become a place my coworkers and I frequent. It&#39;s become our version of the bar &#39;Cheers&#39;--where everybody knows our names and faces. So, if you&#39;ve given Cesars a bad review, try them out again at lunch if all else fails you cannot go wrong with the chicken tacos!"

Never thought I&#39;d find good sushi in these parts. The service was outstanding, the servers were super nice and pleasant. For appetizers, we tried the baby King Kong which had the perfect balance of creaminess and crunchiness. My husband ordered the Sake/Salmon Don which was great - it was $17 but it was a big portion, came in a huge dish and was beautifully-plated. I ordered the Double Salmon roll and Alaska roll and both were excellent; the salmon was fresh and buttery! They have their house salad listed on the menu for $4 but I believe the miso soup and salad comes free if you order sushi. I would double check though. Also worth pointing out that the prices are very reasonable! Almost, if not all of the special rolls are $10.50 each and the regular ones are $5 and up. If you&#39;re a huge sushi eater like my husband and I, then you know that is way cheaper than you would get at most restaurants. 

The ambiance is nice, pretty quiet. They added some decor and I think they tried to make the place look somewhat fancy but you can tell that the building is quite old. Nonetheless, I think this will be our new go-to sushi spot in the area."

An overdue review for one of my oldest bookmarked locales.  I don&#39;t mind driving a ways for great sushi, and a plus that Renita M and I could finally catch up a bit. 

Strip mall location. The restaurant is a little cramped and there&#39;s nothing special about the décor. In our section of the restaurant (there are two) it was pretty plain.  But clean. 

We ordered edamame to start but was pleasantly surprised that we each got salad and miso soup as well.  Our order was just some nigiri and maki so perhaps everyone gets the extras.  
I loved the ginger dressing--it was light and creamy and a nice change from many sushi houses where their ginger dressings are often over-powering.  The miso soup was pleasant--nothing too special. 

Our sushi choices were fresh and well-made. White Dragon Roll, California Roll and another I can&#39;t recall.  SWT, Red Snapper and a couple other nigiri pieces.  Our meal was satisfying and at a reasonable price.  

My son got the shrimp and veggie tempura appetizer for his dinner and he enjoyed it as well. 

Nice spot, friendly service."

Kinta had wonderful reviews so we decided to give it a go. It can be found in a strip mall along with a 7-11 and you&#39;re met with friendly workers inside.

Their bento boxes are mighty pricey! $17.50 for chicken but it sure comes with a ton of food! It might just be worth the hefty price tag as we pulled out box after box for the bento box portion of our meal. Their teriyaki chicken was decent though nothing I&#39;m over the moon over and just ever so slightly dry.

For my main meal I had a couple of their basic rolls - Spicy Tuna Roll and the Philly Roll. Their spicy tuna is quite spicy and comes with cucumber (not listed) but I liked it. Same goes for the Philly Roll - a solid option and I liked it just fine. Both were sloppily rolled though, not neatly/tightly done so they were falling apart a bit. 

All in all, Kinta Sushi is a viable option when in the area though I wouldn&#39;t make it a destination spot. Their sushi chef needs to tigheten up the game a bit, as well!"

The servers and sushi chefs are always smiling and gracious hosts, often bringing miso soup or a house salad with fantastic ginger dressing free of charge. 

I love the wakame salad and sashimi. Several rolls are stand outs: American Dream, Lady Roll, Terminate, and Volcano. Sake don is generous in amount of salmon and rice is usually very good. 

I&#39;ve never had a glass of sake, beer or wine here but I think it&#39;s adorable when you ask for a Coke and they bring out a tall glass of ice and cold can of pop."

Not only psyched but also shocked. My husband and I, if we could, would live on sushi all day every day 365 days a a year. But unfortunately my name isn&#39;t Kim and his name isn&#39;t Kanye ( or maybe rather FORTUNATELY) but either way we don&#39;t have the funds to eat sushi every day!

So we checked out the yelp reviews and pictures and gave it a shot. We ordered pickup. 

My favorite item was the jalapeño bomb. Those were delicious. I feel like pickup was not the best option for this place because the food was not as good as we had hoped. I think if we had been eating in and consumed the food as it was coming out freshly made then I would have liked it better. 

Some of the rolls were so big I could barely fit them into my mouth in one bite. The items tasted somewhat fresh. Everything was packaged very nicely as well. 

All in all, I would say it was an OK experience. Maybe we will give them one more chance when in town again and we will definitely dine in next time.

We compromise and find places that serve other things. We saw the great ratings for Kinta and thought we would try it out! Maybe it could be our new sushi grounds!

I ordered the Kinta Bento Box. You get a little bit of everything! They start you with miso and salad with ginger dressing. There were 2 spots that had steak and chicken with veggies. Then there was a spot with tempura veggies and shrimp. The last spot had 3 pieces of Nigiri and 6 pieces of Maki. It was way more than I could eat! I took the meat and veggies home for lunch the next day! Everything was fantastic though! The cooked items were perfectly done just to the right temp and the sushi was fresh.

The boy ordered the Beef Yaki Udon noodles. He also started with miso and salad with ginger dressing. The noodles were cooked nicely and had a great flavor of the beef! The steak was perfectly cooked too! It was delicious! 

This is a small place, so if customers linger at their tables you&#39;ll have to wait. It got really busy for a Friday night! They did quite a bit of take out while we were there! The servers were really sweet! We&#39;ll be back for sure! We&#39;ll even stop in for take out!"

I had one of the worst experience. I been going to kinta sushi from last four years. So with new management or new chef they are charging extra money for each substitute (vegetables). I asked substitute veggies for meat.  Vegetables are cheaper than meat. Technically they are not adding extra stuff on my sushi. I am still paying for meat still I am not going to eat that. I feel like they are just charging people extra money!

My favorite time to grab take out is lunch time (1130-230). The bento boxes are the best lunch deal. I always get the tempura box which comes with California roll, deep fried sushi, deep fried tempura, salad, soup, and rice for only around $10.

I have a lot of dinner favorites as well. Some good appetizers are the M-80 and baby King Kong. If you like heavy sushi, you will love the King Kong (my favorite). I also recommend the terminate roll, spider roll, and deep fried spicy tuna!"

This fact is even more clear as some fish-centric restaurants are not open on Monday. After many lunch hour taste tests, credible colleagues have discovered that Kinta&#39;s fish is MOST FRESH in preparation for Monday lunch rush. Even more so than on a Thursday or Friday, We recommend visiting early in the week if you are in the neighborhood. Kinta typically does not disappoint.

I didn&#39;t think twice about calling ahead and at the time, I do not think they had a website up with the hours of operation.  The times that I tried happened to be for lunch on a Saturday and dinner on Sunday. They are not open during these time. So make sure you get their hours of operation ahead of time before you head out there. Finally on a Thursday night, my family got to try out Kinta.  

My husband ordered the King Kong roll and I ordered the Shrimp Crunch Roll and shared. Both were good.  They do not have a very extensive menu like other sushi places, but what they made was good.  The server was really nice and the sushi chef was very welcoming.  The place wasn&#39;t very crowded, for it is on the small side, but continued to have a steady stream of customers.  We also had miso soup and salad.  They gave us complimentary soup and rice for our little boys. We enjoyed our rolls and thought about ordering more, however, our nights out with our boys do not last long."

We arrived about an hour before close on a weeknight, figuring we had plenty of time to eat before causing any problems.  There were a few other couples there, but it was by no means crowded, so we were seated right away.  Our waitress was very sweet, potentially a little too shy.

We split a couple of rolls and a couple bottles of hot sake between us.  As others have mentioned, the rolls are very wide- most slices took two bites for me to be able to handle.  I forget which rolls we ordered, but both were very good and we were pretty well stuffed after splitting the two of them.  The order came with a gratis bowl of miso and salad, which was a nice touch (and something I typically have only seen at the AYCE places, where they would prefer to fill you up sooner than later).

The only major downfall about eating here was that they were obviously ready to close up and head out the moment we got done.  A lady who appeared to be a manager or owner kept walking around to see if we were done and they started breaking down tables, cleaning, and otherwise getting ready to go home shortly after we got our food.  A few of the staff were sitting in the booth by the front door, obviously waiting for the last couple of patrons to finish so they too could get out the door.  It made the entire process of wrapping up a little uncomfortable and felt a little rushed."

I like sushi and saw it had nearly perfect reviews, so I was excited to try it. Seeing as it was 9:00 and they closed at 9:30, we were only a mile away so we jumped in the car. I too work in the restaurant industry and its a pain in the ass when customers walk in when it&#39;s close to closing time, so I get it, but we do not ever turn anyone away even if they ask to be seated a minute before &#34;closing&#34;.

A lot of the rolls here are different &amp; yummy meaning the fusion of textural components really worked for me. The Yellow submarine, Miami &amp; Godzilla are my favorite rolls here (tried more than half of the rolls on their menu.) 
The highlight for me is the sake (salmon). I tasted no hint of fishiness &amp; nothing but that natural sweet flavor and fresh salmon taste. I always order 10 or more salmon nigiri (fish over rice) every time I come.

I have yet to dine in here, all my orders were carryout but I&#39;d love to make it a date night sometime.

Of all the times I&#39;ve been there, (over 6) there was only one mishap. I ordered 6 pieces of salmon nigiri and received only 4. I called back and they offered to fix the problem if I drove back.. apparently I already had one too many sake shots and decided not to drive, but nice gesture. ;) No doubt I&#39;ll be back for more."

Went in for lunch today and was surprised by the huge menu of rolls.  I cannot comment on the sashimi/nigiri as I had a Maki C for lunch which had a Cali roll, tuna roll and spicy salmon roll.  They all tasted fresh.  As always the spicy roll could be more spicy for me.  I like spicy to be spicy.  But it was still delish.  The rolls weren&#39;t pristinely shaped to dazzle your eyes off but I am definitely coming back again.

You have to over look the strip mall and pull in, then look past the interior of this place.  It&#39;s small, a little dark and not too shiny...but do try the Taco/Tako Yaki....fried octopus dough with shredded tuna skin on top.  Melt in your mouth, donut hole sized bites of fried dough with octopus in it.  These are a little spicy with a brown sauce drizzled on top.  Don&#39;t be scared, try them."

I&#39;m a pretty picky eater over all and the thought of raw fish just did not do it for me. I was craving miso soup, though, and this place was really highly reviewed on Yelp and I figured I could get chicken teriyaki if I wanted a more substantial meal. 

But when we got there, my more adventurous friend convinced me to get one of the dinner specials that came with California rolls and a couple of pieces of nigiri and to just suck it up and try it. Oh boy was that a mistake. Since that day I have been to Kinta almost every week. I&#39;m completely addicted. Every waiter there knows me and a few even know my regular order. (California sunset, California roll, and the vegetable tempura appetizer) But I&#39;ve seriously gotten almost every roll on offer and all of them are delicious.

It was a little dry; I found it hard to swallow and had to keep drinking water. I finished my meal and was waiting to get my check (since I saw other customers paying at the table).

My husband has been on a sushi kick for a bit now and while I am learning to like it...even the raw items...it is more his favorite and not mine quite yet.  You may want to keep that in mind while reading this particular review. 

We drove up and I tried to pre-warn him that this sushi hot spot was located in a non-descript strip mall.  Apparently, he wasn&#39;t listening too well as he was not impressed by the outside of the building and the empty parking lot.  With plenty of hesitation we walked inside.  Color me plenty surprised as it&#39;s quite nice and cute inside!  They wanted to seat us in the main dining room off to the right hand side, but I wanted to see the chefs in action and requested a table straight back near the sushi table.  They agreed and we were quickly seated.  There were two chefs ready to work, but we took a while to make our decisions.  There was a lot to consider.  I decided to try some beef gyoza while my husband started with some Chef&#39;s Choice nigiri.  I loved their gyoza!  It was served piping hot with a nice dipping sauce.  There were five pieces and they were a nice size.  Ultimately, this ended up being the vast majority of my dinner because I filled up so quickly.  The nigiri was a hit, too!  The yellowtail was the fan favorite and the whole dish was a success.

We moved on to ordering some additional dishes.  And because my eyes are truly bigger than my stomach, I ordered a spicy scallop roll (cooked) and a shrimp tempura roll (yes, cooked).  My meal came with a little side salad.  The dressing was creamy and very tasty.  He ordered more nigiri and a roll that was raw and served with salmon on top.  He really enjoyed it, but said the nigiri was so good that he could have just stuck with that all evening.  I ate a bite of each of my rolls and brought them home to my son.  I was just too full from the gyoza.  

The restaurant started to fill up a little while we were there and there were quite a few carryout orders.  I think maybe we were a little early at 6ish.  We had excellent service from both woman who were hustling back and forth.  The dishes were cleared promptly and the glasses were kept full.  

The prices were competitive.  My sushi man confirmed he would absolutely stop by for dinner again and I would concur.  Kinta Sushi has made the go-to list for dinner options."

The salads are always great and tempura are in generous portion. Also, recommend the taco yaki appetizer, which is small but delicious.

My past experience here has sort have been disappointing because I waited literally more than an hour for my lunch to come out. This was during lunch time where most people have only an hour lunch break between work. I was compensated with ice mochi, but hopefully that this will be my only bad experience here because all the other times had been great, keeping my review at a solid 4."

I had pretty high hopes for Kinta since it was recommended by a friend, but it fell short of expectations. Upon walking in we awkwardly stood there waiting for someone to greet us and the &#34;host&#34; stand is oddly placed on the other side of their wall divider with employees back to the entrance, very weird.

Our service was good, someone always followed up with us and our food came out fairly quickly.

Shrimp and vegetable tempura app (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw): how can you go wrong with tempura? Hot, crispy, and I believe they gave us 3 shrimp versus two, +1!

Complimentary house salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#LjmvAuQQcMQ2bd5MVnM-nQ): I love free things and appreciate the complimentary item.

Chicago Crazy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#lF5Tsl1K4QAaLdPKO3gwxw): I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes when I saw they had this! This is my all time favorite roll and Kinta did it almost right. I didn&#39;t find the fish as fresh as it could be.

Rainbow (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#Or1gkwm52DhcnTuWWxdLhA): it wasn&#39;t a melt in your mouth type of feel, not bad though. 

King Kong (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#V7CLqNHnABasIWXe6NE67A): I can see why it&#39;s called the King Kong, this maki is huge! Definitely overpowering, but pretty good.

Godzilla (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kinta-sushi-carol-stream?select=nWQfimLdQgnLsnQKfBWOpw#V7CLqNHnABasIWXe6NE67A): our favorite, can you tell we like tempura?

I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. He enjoyed it very much as well. The service is good. The sushi is great. I don&#39;t remember exactly what we had but it was fresh and delicious. This place is small so I would not recommend it for a party or group more than 4.

This review is purely on the takeout experience, as the food that I&#39;ve had (both takeout and dine in) has always been great and flavorful. I refrained from writing about my last experience, thinking it was a one-off, but after last night, I don&#39;t think it was.

The last time I got takeout from here, I failed to check all the boxes (or any boxes for that matter!) before I left. We don&#39;t live that far from the restaurant, but far enough that it&#39;s not just down the street. When we got home, we found that the order that I was give was NOT the order I called in. It was completely different! When I called about it, they were apologetic and offered a credit for our next meal.

This time, I called in another phone order and had them repeat the order to make sure that it was right. They quoted 25-30 minutes for the takeout order. I arrived closer to the 30 minute mark since I also had kiddo with me. Those with toddlers know that a wait at a restaurant can go either really good or really bad. Totally depends on how the wind blows! When I arrived, they asked which was my order, and I had a bad feeling when I saw her face. While I waited, I had no less than three other takeout orders come and go before I finally asked where my order was. Kiddo and I were coming up on waiting for 20 minutes. No one really gave me a straight answer as to where my order was, but there was very hurried and frustrated Japanese being thrown around between the workers. Our order finally came, but with no explanation or apology until I asked for the owner. He also had no explanation, which was disappointing. Once I got all the bags and kid into the car, I came to realize that they probably did not start our order until I walked in, as I had 3 rolls of basic sushi (no bells or whistles) and an order for noodles for the kid. I&#39;ll still go to Kinta, but definitely for dine in rather than take out"

I will admit I skeptical because of the strip mall appearance, the strip mall looks old and dumpy and it is easy to overlook this place. The inside is cozy, dim lit, with both tables and booths. I like the set up because the seating feels private in most areas. My girlfriend took the liberty to order since she was the expert here. 

We ordered a soft shell crab appetizer, best ss crab I&#39;ve ever had, crispy and just delicious. She ordered rolls and I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember which, but they were all very good and full of different flavors. The wait staff are very pleasant and cheerful, very knowledgable about their menu which is a huge help. I have since been here two more times and have yet to be disappointed with the food or service.

At Kinta, I couldn&#39;t taste salt at all, yet every dish was flavorful and satisfying! Put them in a more kitschy locale and they&#39;ll be overflowing in 5 stars!!"

My older sister took me here for the first time back in 2009, and my life has forever changed. If you don&#39;t know what to get, I highly suggest the Baby King Kong, the Mountain, M-80, 911, their yaki udon (beef or chicken, both are delish!) and their fried green beans!

I have to credit Kinta for my love of sushi. I had tried it before, and I&#39;ve had sushi countless other times after Kinta... However, Kinta is the standard I hold other sushi to.

The freshness and quality of Kinta has ALWAYS been it&#39;s reason for being the best in the area. It&#39;s like a hidden treasure tucked into a small business strip next to the Carol Stream P.D.

Everytime you walk in you are greeted with a hello from behind the counter. there is ample seating now that they expanded into the new area. The service is always quick, and it&#39;s a smaller place so if you need something faster just grab any of the servers walking by. The prices are very comparable to other restaurants also."

Service is polite and attentive.  I swear that all of their appetizers are excellent from the baby king kong rolls to the asparagus beef.  The sushi quality/taste is very close if not the same as the &#34;city&#34; quality/standards, but especially consistent.

We said we would just order everything right away because we knew what we wanted. She took our drink orders and walked away. 5 minutes later, a different lady comes to our table and tells us they are now closed! I&#39;m sorry.

I&#39;ve been here quite a few times, but haven&#39;t had the chance to given a review.  The sushi here is fairly priced and I recommend coming a bit early since the place does get crowded pretty quick in the evening. I have also been here during lunch on a Tuesday and it was packed as well.  

Went out last week with a group and was seated quickly, the restaurant was pretty packed on a Thursday night.  The waitress was kind and seated us quickly. Received the complementary miso soup and salad.  Ordered the Takoyaki, very good and the price is reasonable compared to many other places that I have been too.  For rolls we ordered the Lady Roll, Double Salmon Roll, Chicago Crazy, and the Volcano Roll.

I recommended starting off with the Chicago Crazy roll, some may not be a fan since it has lettuce in it, but its was very refreshing eating this roll then moving on to the heavier rolls.  The cuts of fish were large and fresh.  The salmon and tuna were the melt in your mouth kind! Avocado in the rolls were large and fresh as well.

We also ordered the Bibimbap, which came out in the stone bowl and the rice crisped up nicely.  I would of liked more meat in my bibimbap, but overall it was very good."

It took a while to find a decent place in the suburbs for sushi and this place hits the spot.  For me this place has good prices and good sushi,  Delicious rolls overall, rice was tender, and the fish was fresh. Creative Maki combinations too to note!

We spent $50 for sushi for 2.  They threw in 2 miso soups complimentary.  (I am always appalled when restaurants charge for miso soup.... it&#39;s just broth with tofu for God&#39;s sake!)

Anyway... maybe one day we&#39;ll actually dine in and enjoy the sushi sans kiddos!"

The service is gracious but a little scattered but I don&#39;t care, just as long as they keep bringing the fish they can do anything they want.

We&#39;re glad we did. They have a huge menu of appetizers, sushi, and dinners. We pretty much stick with sushi, and have tried many of their rolls. They have a good selection of creative rolls and lots of more mainstream rolls as well. Last time we were there we tried the shrimp and veg combo tempura and it was the best tempura I&#39;ve ever had--super light and crispy, the way it should be. They also give you miso soup AND salad with your meal. The staff has always been really friendly as well. We&#39;ve put this on our list of favorites.

I have to agree with the other reviewer about the toilet smelling. I used the bathroom the last time we were there and it smelled really bad on there. That&#39;s my only negative though."

We&#39;re so glad we did!

The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. They have never once messed up an order, and the wait between courses is very minimal. The restaurant is not that large, but you don&#39;t feel claustrophobic even on its busy days. Kinta recently added an additional wing, undoubtedly to accommodate all the new happy customers! And while some don&#39;t like the 90s music they play, it&#39;s always one of the many highlights of our visits. 

We always enjoy the house salad and miso soup they bring out at the start of the meal. The salad isn&#39;t the run-of-the-mill, iceberg lettuce-laden concoction that passes for house salad at other places, and it comes dressed with a delicious sweet glaze. The miso soup is delicate but still very tasty.  

Our favorite dishes are the jalapeno bombs, the American Dream Roll, and the King Kong Roll. The King Kong has a nice crunch and is topped with that delicious sweet mayo glaze that&#39;s also found on the jalapeno bombs. The prices are very reasonable and Kinta doesn&#39;t skimp on the portions.  What more could you ask for?"

Good fried chicken is not quantum physics folks. Let&#39;s break it down shall we? And I will add my thoughts on how Brown&#39;s Chicken stacks up in turn. 

1) Chicken needs to be decent quality-
Highly doubtful in this instance, or it would of been far more succulent and meaty. 

2) Use of good flour mixed with appropriate seasoning to emphasize taste:
It was good and crunchy, but it was devoid of much flavor. They do have hot sauce available, but if you have to douse your chicken with hot sauce then there is obviously a problem. 

3) Make sure chicken fry oil is changed out regularly so it does not give the chicken that &#34;burnt&#34; taste (ideally pan fried):
No dice from Brown&#39;s chicken on this one either. 

4) Chicken is not over-battered:
Nothing sucks more than biting into a piece of chicken that seems huge, but the reality is it just has a layer of crust 2 inches thick. This is one area Brown&#39;s did decent on, but one out of 4 is not going to cut it. 

This place is simply not legit by any true chicken lovers standards. The biscuits were not very tasty either. Kind of doughy with a hint of flour. Their fried okra (a personal fav of mine that I was actually excited to see on the menu) was greasy similarly lifeless.  The lone highlight side dish was the mac and cheese, which was really tasty, but this was hardly enough to elevate this place&#39;s overall rating. Looks like I am going to have to make a pilgrimage to the ghetto sooner rather than later if there is ever going to be a decent 2 piece and a biscuit in my future."

I had ordered from them a couple times previously, and the food was pretty good. They send coupons to us, and I in turn thought to order from them.

Well I just tried ordering from them a few nights or so ago, and everything seemed to be fine until I got a call ten minutes after placing the order that they don&#39;t deliver to our location. This makes no sense, because they have delivered to us a couple of times already. I also have seen other people in our apartment complex order from them on occasion. He said that he told somebody here that they don&#39;t deliver here anymore as it was too far, but it wasn&#39;t me.

I wouldn&#39;t have been upset if they had told me upfront when I called to place the order that they no longer deliver to this location, but they actually charged my card first and then called back to tell me this. That is how you know this is a bad business. Rather than just delivering one last time to a place you have been to before you decide to cancel the order after you already accepted payment. Now I have the misfortune of having to check my bank statements to make sure that pending order goes away after the order was cancelled. If not I am going to have to call in and get a refund for the food that was not delivered. Incredibly inconvenient!

I actually just checked their map of the places they deliver to on their website, and it still shows us as being within the area that they deliver to. Maybe they want to update that map? Also, maybe you want to stop sending coupons to a place where you won&#39;t deliver to. I just got new coupons for Rosario&#39;s in the mail. Why would they still send their promotions here if we aren&#39;t able to order from here? The food isn&#39;t bad, but the place seems to be poorly organized and cares little for customers. Don&#39;t order here if you don&#39;t want to waste your time or be in jeopardy of being ripped off."

I got a menu flyer in the mail, and thought some of the items looked pretty tempting.  Using their online ordering system, I ordered a 1/2 Italian style chicken and a side of meatballs.  The chicken was, to say the least, boring.  Extremely bland, skimpy, and just tasted like it was baked with a coating of oil for crispness.  The meatballs were decent, but the marinara was on point.  Extra star for the free fries (it&#39;s the small things, folks) and the soft yet crusty italian bread.  I&#39;d like to try their pizza during one of my next cheat days..."

But the customer service is so horrible I had to give it one star. They were beyond negligent in delivering my order, they initially delivered my partial order and said they would come back  (5 hours late! My older parents were in their pajamas). They then had the gall to call and ask if we even still wanted it after saying it was on the way three separate times, but delayed because the driver was completing other orders first. (It sounded just as ridiculous to me, too) When I finally spoke with the manager the next day he was so rude to me he went from throwing his delivery driver under the bus saying it was all his incompetence to insulting me for saying I would not come back. We ended civilly enough, but there is no universe where an OWNER should raise his voice at a customer. period.  (and mind you I never raised my voice or even got heated, it is after all JUST pizza). This was a month ago and I wasn&#39;t going to write a review because I thought he may have been hacing a bad day and he assured us I would get a full refund (despite ordering and eating the pizza). However, I never receive any compensation, aside from a rude phone call asking the last four digits of my card number to perform such a refund. I had a suspicion the owner was full of hot air, but this failure to follow through on a promise just shows it. If you want to support a family owned business, go somewhere else. This rude and unprofessional owner does NOT deserve your time."

I love the food, soups, shakes. I often will order a piece of soup bread (a piece of bread with 3 - 4 diagonal cuts to make it easier to rip apart, only $.99!)

There is a great secret menu - the Lucky 7 (a wreck with double meat, using the meat from an Italian) is my favorite. One of my favorite things about Potbelly is that you can customize your sandwich any way you want. Meatballs on your a Wreck (a wrecking ball), they can do it! I also love that their chicken and tuna salads are meat heavy, not tuna heavy. I also like that neither have onions (you can add onions if you want, but it&#39;s not in the salad). 

Also, if you have a problem with your Potbelly experience, if you go onto their website and let them know, they&#39;ll do something about it (I know for a fact they then go to district and store managers with customer feedback), and they reward you with two free sandwiches for your bad experience.

I know Potbelly is &#39;just another fast food chain&#39;, but this one&#39;s location and staff is pretty exceptional.

First off, $1 giant pickles! If that&#39;s not the way to a ladies heart, I dunno what is.

Second, they&#39;ve got live music most lunches/evenings and the musicians are indie, local, and outstanding - not to mention the show they&#39;re putting on is 100% free! 

Third, Ifound my new favorite sandwich at potbelly thanks to my man-friend (meow!) and the super-chill closing shift guy, after they bonded over their distinguished ice cream palates.  

So, which &#39;wich the new best in show? THE ICE CREAM COOKIE SANDWICH!!!

They take 2 of their full size cookies (as big as a child&#39;s head) and smoosh mounds of creamy, delicious vanilla ice cream in between. And you get to pick the cookie kind, usually sugar cookie, oatmeal chocolate chip, and few other usual cookie flavor suspects, but apparently the real ice cream cookie sandwich cookie combo win is the chocolate chip brownie cookie with vanilla ice cream.

They added a turkey BLT toasty sandwich to their menu and I thought it was really tasty. Toasty tasty! ;) 

I like that you can get either bottled drinks or fountain sodas. I tend to go for the fountain sodas for free refills. 

I tried my first chocolate brownie cookie- oh my- how delicious! Everyone at my seminar (I saved it for later) sitting around me seemed very jealous. I wonder if it tasted even better because of that? ;)

Basically every sub is toasted, and of course you don&#39;t like toasted subs, that won&#39;t toast it. They offer around ten to fourteen different toppings, which have always been very fresh. 

They offer soda as well as tons of different juices, teas and bottle water. They also have some kick ass potato salad and macaroni salad.

The food is awesome as usual, just like other Potbelly&#39;s sandwiches. I typically get a Roast Beef or Wreck on Regular, both of which are exquisite sandwiches :)

My husband LOVES coming here, and I try to avoid Sub/sandwich places because my parents had a love affair with Subway when I was growing up, and I just got really sick of sandwiches.  But in any case, I think this is a good location for this chain.

My husband always orders the same thing--the Pizza Sub w/ no pepperoni on wheat.  I have snuck a couple bites an I like it.  My personal fav is the toasted TKY and the vegetable soup. 

What knocks this down a star is the lack of soup TWICE in two weeks when I went there.  Talk about a bummer!

Good thing I tried it again.  Since my second time trying Potbelly&#39;s I have not gone back to the other sandwich places around.

I usually get the roast beef on white, but today I had the Italian sandwich, and I think it is the best Italian sandwich of any of the chain stores that are around (you know who you are!).

If you like pickles, their pickle oil gives the sandwich another layer of flavor due to the vinegary tang.  Exceptional!  Their bread is baked and I firmly believe that bread baked well can make a mediocre sandwich tasty, and crumbly, tasteless bread can make a good sandwich almost unedible.  Props to Potbelly&#39;s for their delicious bread.

I&#39;m only giving this 4 stars, because this Potbelly&#39;s is located in a outdoor mall full of store blocks and one way streets.  Okay, whatever, it&#39;s a hoity-toity area.  So be it.  But it&#39;s the closest Potbelly&#39;s to work -- and everyone else&#39;s work too apparently; and it&#39;s busy most of the times I go there.

I cannot say more about this awesome sandwich shop, but WOW! :)  

Overall ALL the Potbelly Sandwich Works restaurants have been awesome and the consistancy is impeccable! So, if you go to one you can expect the same quality sandwich at another.

Of all the sandwich shops chains out there, THIS one is my absolute best! It has toasted sandwiches, it has awesome chili, soup, potato salad, cole slaw, etc.  All taste very fresh and homemade (or pretty darn close if it isn&#39;t!)  

I always have either the Italian OR the Wreck.  I also enjoy the PB&amp;J sandiwich(yes, you heard me) which is awesome(but messy) when toasted.  Their sandwiches are simple, but VERY flavorful(especially if you add hot peppers! yum!)

They also serve hand-dipped ice cream and yummilicous malts. They have other little sweets like cookies, ice cream cookie sandwiches as well.  

This particular location is QUITE busy especially during lunchtime, so expect to wait in line for a bit as they get your sandwiches done. As every sandwich is made to your taste, it will take a little bit to get your sandwich ready. But, oh man, is it worth it! 

Crispy, toasted bread(wheat or white), warm meats and cheese. Their homemade hot pepper mix is hot without being overly so. 

The restaurant itself is very clean and the music is upbeat and not overly blaring or distracting either.  Very casual, but not so much to make it look cheap.  The antique shop decor is interesting and adds to the ambiance of the place. 

Definitely want to go here if you love deliciously toasted sub sandwiches. If it were closer, I&#39;d be going everyday. :)"

We spotted this place across the parking lot and thought we&#39;d give it a shot. 

In my years as a gluten-free foodie, I&#39;ve found that in eating out, unless a restaurant specifically caters to the GF crowd, your two safest cuisines are generally Mexican and Japanese. In the former, avoid flour tortillas, and the latter, avoid noodles and wheated soy. 

This means MOST sushi is a-ok, aside from eel, inari, or any of the specials with eel sauce. You can bring your own GF soy sauce (tamari) from home, or many restaurants are starting to carry it. 

When we arrived last night, aside from one other duo, the restaurant was empty. There was the sushi chef and two female hostess/waitress types. They were helpful...almost to the point of rushing us. We asked for water to start, and they took away the drink menus before we even had a chance to open them.

I&#39;m not sure if they were bored or what, but two people fussing over my table every two minutes leaves me feeling a bit anxious, even if it&#39;s well-intentioned. 

We ordered nigiri and a couple of rolls. They were tasty, but nothing super-special. The fish was fresh, good, and prices were only slightly more than those in our hometown of Madison, WI. 

Overall, it was a solid, tasty meal, and a nice alternative to the prices I&#39;m used to looking at on hotel restaurant or room service menus. I&#39;ll likely stop back if I stay at the Westin again, but I wouldn&#39;t go out if my way to eat here otherwise."

Small with some inviting decor, swift waitresses and delicious food will bring me back again soon. It was kinda weird to eat in here alone, so I will either bring a friend or do carryout. It was busy on a Wednesday afternoon. But I still had great service. 

Gyoza. Hopefully I got that right. Better than a potsticker. This was a crispy treat!

I opted for a simple chicken teriyaki lunch special. A beautiful layout of chicken with large, flavorful (and colorful) salad arrived with a side of rice sprinkled with some Japanese seasoning. The rice seasoning was different and unique to me, but it was good. The green tea has caffeine, so I didn&#39;t try it. It smelled good though. Served a lovely lunch by some stellar servers...I&#39;ll head in again soon!"

The service here is fantastic and the food follows in suit.  We are always greeted happily and served promptly.  I have gotten a lot of different things on the menu here and I have not been disappointed.

I understand that sushi restaurants have a tendency to be slow, but this one is the worst I&#39;ve seen.  My first experience was eating at the restaurant with another co-worker.  One of us ordered the box lunch and I ordered the sushi lunch special.  After waiting for 45 minutes, we asked where our lunch was and was told it was coming right away.  After another 10 minutes, we asked and were given the same response.  After another 5 minutes, we had to get back to the office and asked for them to put it in to-go boxes since we had to get back to the office.  They treated this as an inconvenience and it took another 10 minutes to get us our food to-go.  They offered no concessions, which I thought was completely inappropriate, considering our box lunch was soggy and cold by the time we got back to the office.  

The second time, I walked in and ordered their lunch special to-go.  I waited for over 1/2 hour and asked when I could expect my order.  I was told another 10 minutes.  After 15 minutes, I asked again and was told that it was coming right away.  I finally left after another 5 minutes.  

I believe part of the issue with this place is that there&#39;s a huge communication gap with the hostess.  I can tell she struggles with the language, but I don&#39;t think this is an excuse to tell me &#39;another 10 minutes&#39; every time I ask a question about where my food is.

I worked in foodservice for 10 years so I am probably more patient than most when it comes to service. However, I have no patience for waitstaff who can&#39;t make commitments to fix issues when they occur and then make no apologies for that.  I am disappointed that this place has such bad service, since it is so convenient to my work and there&#39;s no other sushi place close by.  I&#39;ll purchase sushi off of a grocery store shelf before I go here again."

They say you shouldn&#39;t go to a sushi rest. on Monday because the fish is from Saturday (Sunday being the day the fish market is closed) and not fresh.  There are a lot of sushi places closed on Mondays and that&#39;s why. Well, the fish was less than outstanding and the rice was a little old tasting and my tuna was stringy. The salmon roe was just okay and not fresh.  

On the plus side, the staff (with the exception of the sushi chef)  was very friendly, there is a sake list and a wine list and I found a combination sushi plate on the menu, which is how I like to order.

I would go back there but not on a Monday.  When we left at about 7:45 the place was still mostly empty.  Their prices are quite reasonable but then I guess you get what you pay for."

That is how I usually order from here (last night included.)  Typically I&#39;m ordering a &#39;sushi deluxe&#39; or a steak teriyaki if I eat for dinner, but the lunch boxes are a good option for lunch.  Been going here for 10 years or so, and have never had a bad meal.

After picking up my order, I basically inhale everything.  I was going to take a picture of my order and post it last night, but I couldn&#39;t put the chopsticks down!  By the time I was done, I was still thinking about taking a picture of the empty containers, but decided against it...  The little salad that comes with the hot dishes is a nice contrast (has a tart vinaigrette dressing) to the other food ordered...I just wish it came with the sushi dishes also!

I am definitely a fan of this place!"

I have never been moved to write a review for a restaurant before.  Yelp has helped me find so many great out of the way places. I feel that I owe the Yelp community a positive review of this great place to eat. 

It is a little out of place tucked in next to the Westin and a little hard to find.  My coworker and I went for dinner while on a business trip.  He was a little concerned as they weren&#39;t too busy. I imagine they cater to more of a corporate lunch crowd. Honestly had I not read the reviews I probably would have driven right by and that would have been a mistake. 

The miso was much more flavorful than I am accustomed.   I&#39;m thinking it might not be a more traditional recipe but it is the best I&#39;ve ever had. The salad was crisp. The sushi was fresh and as good as my favorite local joint.  The &#34;Westin&#34; roll was explosively flavored. My friend had a teriyaki seafood that he said was fantastic. The service was friendly and accommodating and the restaurant was very comfortable.

When I&#39;m out working in our Itasca office, Hirano is usually one of my favorite lunch spots. Authentic in their Japanese cuisine, they use fresh and flavorful ingredients. In the 5+ years of eating lunch here, I&#39;ve yet to be disappointed. 

The restaurant is fairly small and can get busy during the lunch rush. Service is typically very fast, and very friendly. They truly take care of their patrons. Fantastic! 

I usually order mostly vegetarian options, but there&#39;s also a couple meaty ones I enjoy. My favorites are:
- Edamame ((duh))
- Gom-ae ((spinach)) salad
- Veggie Crunch roll
- Tamago ((egg omelet)) nigiri
- Asparagus beef roll ((thin sliced beef rolled will asparagus and broiled with teriyaki sauce))
- Chicken teriyaki

I only wish I worked in Itasca more often, as I was a regular back in the day. The food is good, the service is friendly, and my non-fish eating needs are always met. Hirano always leaves me full, happy, and ready to face the afternoon back at work."

I was not happy.  The miso soups were in little containers, hardly half of what you&#39;d get in a bowl, which I thought was skimpy.  The rolls were just OK.  The Dynamite roll was good, but Boston and Spicy Tuna were the just OK rolls.  I had asked for the Dynamite not to be fried and they fried it anyway, which accounted for about 5 of the 50 minutes I waited.

The two ladies were very friendly and nice although they did forget my tempura appetizer order but rushed to get it out once I reminded them.

It was a Saturday, and the place with the exception of a large party from a meeting at the Westin was empty. 

My green tea was cold, and was not refilled, although I am sure I could have gotten more had I asked. The sushi came and I was surprised that for each order, I only received one piece. The prices were rather high for one piece but I understand frugality. 

I finished my meal, and left paying somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 dollars for 4 pieces of Nigiri and 2 rolls. 

This place is in no way a bargain, and the fish while alright, certainly not poison, costs a premium price.  Although I expected the meal to be high, what this being a hotel restaurant. The check for a snack at Hirano&#39;s would have gotten me a steak at Shula&#39;s on the same property. 

Unless you really cant stomach the idea of calling out from the hotel, and steak or the room service is not your thing. I would have to say avoid this place, it is nothing to write home about."

Falafil Hut, tucked into and almost hidden in a strip mall in Hoffman, does not disappoint in the least. I drove by this place daily for a solid couple of months when I moved here without noticing it. It&#39;s strange, but so many of the businesses in Hoffman almost appear like they are trying to hide from consumers. This stands in stark contrast to down the street in Schaumburg where where merchants are about as obnoxious with their marketing as a whorehouse in Tijuana. I have payed this joint a visit a good dozen times since first checking it out. Considering how into restaurants that I am, if I have been anywhere more than 5-6 times in such a short time period, I would say it is safe to assume that the food is on point. 

The menu here is simple and short, but all you really need to be mindful of if you have never visited before is the Chicken Shwarma. Order it in wrap or salad form and dig in, as your taste buds are in for a treat. The portion sizes are large here, but I&#39;ll bet you polish off the whole thing anyway as it is simply delicious.The meat is super tender and seasoned with what must be crack considering how addictive it is. You should drizzle some of the garlic sauce on it to give it that dynamite flavor contrast. This also cuts out some of the heat if you opt for the &#34;extra spicy&#34; version, which is my personal preference. Is it hot? Absolutely, but it is not melt your face off hot. I would keep a cold beverage nearby, but fans of extremely spicy food will find it to be mere child&#39;s play on the Scoville scale. 

I have tried several other items on the menu here (the lamb is a solid choice) but I always manage to gravitate back towards the Chicken. The hummus several of my coworkers are huge fans of, but to me it is just average. Though suffice to say that I am much of a fan of hummus just in general, so take that with a grain of salt. I did post a picture of the menu to check out since there is not one listed online. On most of my visits, both the fluffy pita itself and the vegetables have been extremely fresh on the wraps. Now granted that the chicken is so good that you could dip it in motor oil and I would probably still eat it, but it&#39;s nice that all the bases are covered. Pricing is cheap, with the wraps setting you back between 4 and 8 bucks. 

The staff here has always been very personable and helpful on my visits, especially when the owner is in the house. This guy obviously has a passion for the food he serves, which likely explains why it is so well made. Any good independent restauranteur out there is 70% foodie and 30% businessman. The owner loves to chat if it&#39;s not busy, and I have heard the tale of how his restaurant came to be on a couple of occasions. The YouTube food show &#34;Sameer&#39;s Eats&#34; has done an episode on Falafil Hut, which I am sure you can find with a simple Google search if you are interested. 

If you plan to stop in here on your lunch break, I highly recommend you call in your order in advance. Service can slow down to a snails pace during the weekday lunch rush, so plan accordingly. I would also plan on taking your food to go on since there are few places to actually sit. Since I just live right down the street this is not a huge concern for me, but to others looking to have the food piping hot, take your lunch break early as possible so you can score a table. 

There has been some instances of inconsistency when I have dined here, which prevents this place from 5 star billing in my book. Not surprisingly, these have always directly corresponded to times when the owner is not in the building. 

Overall, this is a great option for casual Middle Eastern grub. The prices are decent, the service is normally on point, and the Chicken Shwarma is to die for. Om nom nom."

The food is not authentic middle eastern but that&#39;s part of its charm. The NW suburbs is home to a large indian population and this food is reflective of the same. 

I recommend the Tava Rice with Chicken or Tava Rice with Beef. This is basmati rice with chunks of chicken or beef along with spices pan fried on the girdle (or Tava). This is street food at it&#39;s best."

We stopped here one afternoon after a day of shopping. We picked up a chicken shawarma wrap to share. Just one. That was our first mistake. I almost didn&#39;t share it with the hubby. It was so good. I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.

A few weeks later, the hubs asked if I wanted him to pick up a chicken shawarma wrap on his way home from that area (we live about 30 minutes away). I said &#34;yes!!&#34; When he arrived home, it was still warm and it was delicious. A little of the sauce dripped onto my sleeve and I spent the next several hours sniffing my sleeve and dreaming of that wrap. 

He brought another home a couple weeks ago. I wasn&#39;t feeling it that night so I stuck it in the fridge. It was just as delicious the next day, reheated. 

The falafils are yummy too!"

I gave them the 4 in the rating because I know how much half a star means to businesses.

This place is pretty small, 2 tables for 3 ppl each and 4 seats or was it 6? at a counter top facing the window.  So if you have a bunch of people, you may want to do take out instead.

Chicken and Gyro combo - The chicken was excellent and the Gyro was pretty good, it&#39;s the kinda they take off the spit and grill on the flat top before serving so it&#39;s crispier. I prefer it straight off the spit, I probably could have asked for it that way so I won&#39;t ding them on that.

Rice - the rice was nicely flavored and fairly fluffy.  

Garlic Mayo  - this was the bomb diggity sauce, I wondered why the guy kinda looked at me weird for a second when I asked for Taziki, I thought it was regular mayo. But he was very nice and gave me what I asked for.  When I tried the Garlic Mayo, dang!

Falafils - I am not a fan of these, they taste like this one packaged diy mix I had at home once, it was pretty dry and not that great. I would take a pass on their name sake sadly.

Lamb - I tried some of my friends lamb, it was pretty good!

FYI, the super combo takes like 25 minutes to make for some reason, so I passed on trying all their food today.

Service - the cashier guy has some issues understanding english but the cook is good and very nice!"

Rejoice, I have found my chicken shawarma go to!

First things first, this is not a place that you dine in. When you walk in through the front door you are greeted to three uninviting 8 foot stacks of to-go containers. There is a counter by the window and some stools but you are better off just picking up and eating in the comforts of your own home.

Secondly, the food was delicious. The chicken shawarma/gyros combo platter wasn&#39;t the most generous (more rice please!) but was it tasty. Chicken pieces had a nice crisp without being overly dry.

What stood out, however, were the Tawwa (Tava) platters! Think middle eastern fried rice but tastier. This is where this place makes it name and should keep you coming back for more. Highly recommended!"

To be honest, the quantity of the food was great by the quality of food was not good at all.....I prefer quality over quantity. 

Feels more like Indian food trying to be Mediterranean cuisine...

I ordered a chicken kabob and shawerma platter but came game to find out there was no &#39;combination&#39; all of it was just kabob. When I called back to complain telling him it was the third time all he had to say was &#39;I gave you 8 pieces of kabob instead of shawerma chicken&#39; well in a regular chicken kabab platter there are 8 pieces anyway so there was t any favor that he did. Moreover, when I complained that why do I always end up paying extra for a combination platter when I just get a simple kabab platter, he was bold enough to say there&#39;s only a 50c difference which again is not right and there&#39;s a $1.50 difference. I don&#39;t care about the money but this is not good customer service!

No doubt their food is really good that&#39;s why I regularly order from here but ever since their old workers left and they have this new Indian guy, my order is never right! This time I purposely spoke in his language (Hindi) assuming he wouldn&#39;t mess up but that wasn&#39;t any help either!"

I would give this place 5 stars if I felt more welcome but its a fast food joint at heart. 

I stopped in yesterday after a while ( I live 30 minutes away else I would be there daily) I had the lamb shwarma and chicken tawa rice. 19 bucks seemed high but ahwell you only live once right 

When I got the food the shwarma weighed about a pound and when I opened it it was all lamb so Its a great deal. The shwarma gave me that juicy mouth watering taste I have been looking for enough spice to make you breath a few times more but the taste oh the taste. 

Next I ordered the chicken tawa ( I told the wife don&#39;t send me to restaurants hungry) its like 1.5 lbs a good amount of chicken its not biryani so the chicken is already in pieces ( love that) oh the taste I am writing this as I eat this to prepare to go somewhere else just in case the food isn&#39;t what it should be. Its spicy but not like a bunch of chli spicy but like deep spicy with layers. I mean I ordered it yesterday had it tonight and it will be lunch tomorrow not cuase I want variety but for the quanity.

I&#39;m from Michigan so I come from home of amazing middle eastern cuisine and so it makes it challenging to actually find a place that comes close, and this place almost does. I was impressed with their hummus as well, it&#39;s soo hard to find actually good hummus and not watered down crap they call hummus here!

He really knows to work the business but when he is not there, one of the other cook can be really nasty with the customers. He has been nice to me just once, out of the many times I have gone and I hope he fixes his attitude before he starts ticking customers off. He messes up orders and is incredibly moody.
If the owner is in the store, your in good hands but if the other guy is cooking, I would check and double, triple check to make sure I got the right order.

- Spicy Chicken Shawarma (10/10)

I ALSO TRIED
- Falafils (8/10)

While I can proudly say that I&#39;ve been eating shawarma long before the 2nd secret ending of The Avengers, I&#39;m still not head over heels about it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s taken me a while to stop by, because out of all the weird things I get cravings for (554, pho, Pok Pok in Portland) shawarma never really gets called. Luckily enough, I decided to stop today by while taking my little shortcut home. 

Back when this place first opened, I was rushing home from work, and needed some kind of sustenance because I was about to engage in an 8 hour battle with internet dragons. Call me a nerd, whatever. Anyway, I bought a chicken shawarma, because that seemed easy, and I came home, scarfed it down, and threw away 8 hours of my life. I do remember it being very tasty and that I should write a review, so...better late than never, right? I&#39;m pretty sure either the owner or head chef changed, because the food does look different. I&#39;ll explain...

SPICY CHICKEN SHAWARMA
When I first came here, there was a menu with 6 items on it, that&#39;s it. I also remember I wanted beef shawarma, but they only had chicken. Looking on their menu today, they definitely now have beef, and they definitely have a lot more than 6 items! Moreover, they are now also &#34;The Home Of The Spicy Chicken Shawarma.&#34; Well, I&#39;m a sucker for &#34;Famous For&#34; type of things, so I had to get it.

They shave some chicken off of the broiler and then throw it on the grill with some onions. I seem to recall it used to be served in a pita, but now it&#39;s served in a pita tortilla kinda thing. They take the tortilla, smear it with hummus, then yogurt sauce, some lettuce, tomato, and onions, then the chicken-onion grill, and then generous amounts of some other sauce, which I assume is the &#34;spicy&#34; part of it. Then they wrap it up. 

The thing is messy. The way they roll it up, it&#39;s very non-functional, as it&#39;s completely open on both sides. They need to get some practice from Chipotle or even Taco Bell.  But other than the messiness, this thing is awesome! 

All the sauces and the juices from the chicken make everything so tender, and the sauces really get around, because every single bite is just bursting with Mediterranean herby flavor and an absolutely perfect amount of seasoning. I hate raw onions, but the flavors of everything else really trapped the raw onion taste that I hate, and only let the very tail end of that linger as the flavors of the whole bite started to trail off. Even better, the lingering of the raw onion sort of enhanced the flavor, and made it last longer. The chicken was great, it never tasted or felt dry, and even if it was, it was in the company of so much juicy goodness that you wouldn&#39;t have known anyway.

This also comes in regular, extra spicy, sweet &amp; spicy, and tandoori. All flavors I will try, now that I know how good this is!

FALAFILS
The place is named for them, and I guess they are pretty good, but 8/10 might be the best I could ever give a filafil. I can&#39;t imagine what could happen that could make me like a filafil any more than that. 

They used to serve these in the shape of a White Castle chicken ring, but now they&#39;re traditional ping pong ball sized and shaped. They had just taken them out of the deep frier and into the paper bag so the paper bag was practically transparent after I got home. The crunch was definitely there, although I&#39;d probably have to call it a crisp, more than a crunch, because it&#39;s a bit lighter. It&#39;s about the same as most falafils I&#39;ve had. 

FALAFILLING!
Messiness aside, that Spicy Chicken Shawarma is hard to beat! I definitely see myself getting the craving for it and, being so close to home, will probably be stopping by all the more!"

Food:
DELICIOUS spicy chicken and lamb shwarmas and (scooped-to-order) falafel. Hummus was very good. Rice was just okay. I would definitely order the same thing again (combination platter with lamb instead of beef). Also, the portions were large. 

Service:
EXCELLENT service. Ahmed (the manager) was cooking. He was very nice and talked to us. There were a number of orders being made ahead of ours so it did take a little while. But you can see all the food being prepared so you have a pretty good idea where your order is in the queue. It&#39;s worth the wait. 

Summary:
We really enjoyed it and will definitely be going back. Why not five stars? Well, it took longer than we expected and the rice was just okay."

You can tell that this place is meant to be a carry out restaurant they have limited seating maybe 11 chairs total. My little brother got a chicken wrap and i got a chicken salad. I told the guy at the register ( who didn&#39;t look like he was so happy to be there) I wanted medium spicy when i got the food it wasn&#39;t what I expected the meat was way to hot even for me ( I&#39;m indian so I can handle my heat) and the salad was just regular lettuce cut up with onions. It wasn&#39;t anything special at all. All in all I&#39;ve been to over 30 different middle eastern restaurants and this place is at the bottom of my list. Ohh and the tahini sauce tastes like it went bad. The place also needs to be cleaned or something to much dirt on the walls and stuff. Im giving it 2 stars because the food wasn&#39;t undercooked and It came out within 8 minutes. Ill go back to give it another try and hopefully i won&#39;t be disappointed again.

But what I will say is their falafel wrap is sooooooo tasty!  

I usually get my falafel sandwiches from Pita House on Roselle Rd, but I wanted to try somewhere different and closer to the office.  To clarify, there is no falafel sandwich at Falafil Hut, they only offer wraps.  But it&#39;s still wrapped in a pita, it&#39;s not a flour tortilla or anything.

This was my first experience there, and I didn&#39;t experience the long wait times that other reviewers complained about.  Everything is made-to-order, but I appreciate that and don&#39;t mind waiting.  It took about 5 minutes to receive my wrap; not bad at all.

The place is small and kind of a dingy, hole-in-the-wall.  There are only about 4 tables, and a counter by the front window with about 4 stools.  I don&#39;t think I would count on being able to dine-in here because if they got very busy there will be nowhere to sit.  

Everything in my wrap was delicious.  The falafel were soooo tasty and all the produce in the wrap (tomatoes, chopped lettuce, and chopped cucumbers) were firm and fresh!  It had just the right amount of tahini so that you could taste it, but it didn&#39;t make the pita soggy.  They might have put a thin layer of hummus in too, but I&#39;m not sure.  

I will definately be back the next time I&#39;m craving falafel.  Next time, I&#39;ll probably phone-in my order ahead of time so it&#39;s ready when I get there.  I heard good things about the Spicy Chicken Shawarma, so I will try that too!"

The sandwiches are huge and we were only able to eat half each. Between the two sandwiches and the incredible humus we ordered it came out to be $16 for both, not bad!

I ordered Carne Asada and my Fiancé ordered the shrimp. They were the most yummy tacos we ever tasted! Two were more than enough. They were very filling.

I has the steak quesadilla ($10). It was VERY cheesy and the steak was tender. The portion was large, so share or come hungry!

It took a while to get waters, we had to ask for silverware, and service in general was pretty slow.  It might have been due to it being a Friday night (@7:45), but if that&#39;s the case, they should staff accordingly.

Pretty much anything with a sugar skull on it is going to interest me, and such was the case here. I had been shopping earlier in the year and saw the glowing sugar skull signage beckoning me in, much like the sirens of the sea-- with much better results. ;) So, I popped in to pick up a menu, which seemed full of interesting and varied choices; so I filed it away for future reference, and tonight was the night I dragged my husband in. It&#39;s a nice, big space, very open, with a bar and some seating upstairs from what we could tell. I really like the open, airy atmosphere. 

You don&#39;t go to a taqueria and not try the tacos, so that&#39;s what we ordered, but first we were met with the standard basket filled with not-at-all standard chips &amp; salsa. The chips themselves were thick, crunchy, properly salted and clearly made in house. The brownish &amp; thick salsa (I know, that sounds terrible!) was probably the best salsa I remember having at any restaurant. Our server indicated it is a new salsa for them. I approve whole heartedly! It was flavorful with a tiny bit of heat in the background only, and just the perfect texture, clinging to each chip being dipped. It probably sounds silly, but we both were impressed and if they sold it in bottles, we would&#39;ve walked out with a couple. This, was a very good start.

We opted for a totally unnecessary appetizer as between the chips and our dinners, it was all too filling. But, my husband ordered the queso fundido app, with added chorizo, served with corn tortillas. I tried one of these and I thought it was very tasty. It&#39;s a weird critique considering what we ordered but it was as most queso fundidos tend to be, too heavy, too cheesy and always cools too quickly into one big glob. Nature of the beast. It was yummy but wouldn&#39;t order it again (probably anywhere).

Between us, we ordered 5 unique tacos. My husband&#39;s consisted of a duck confit, a braised short rib, and a mahi mahi, each perfectly cooked, moist, not a dry or overcooked morsel in the bunch. My two included one smoky and spicy mushroom taco, and one poblano. All were topped with unique accoutrement that really set them apart. Things like huitlacoche (corn smut! It&#39;s a corn fungus), crispy potatoes (but these were like those crispy chow mein noodles you get in Chinese restaurants), and delicious salsas, and so on. EACH taco had its own unique flavor profile, not just a different star ingredient, plopped in the same accompanying ingredients, with everything tasting the same. Each was unique. All were delicious. It&#39;s also worth noting there are nice choices here for vegetarians, and even a couple if you are vegan. 

One complaint was that they are in the process of changing their menu so even though it says you get a side of rice or beans with your 2 or 3 tacos, now you only get that side if you order 2 of the same exact taco. So, being that this was our first time, we wanted to sample the tacos, and therefore had to pay extra for our sides of wanted. Kind of lame. P.S. The arroz verde was delicious, I&#39;d prefer it without queso personally, and the frijoles charros were not what we expected; it was like a VERY soupy salsa with some pintos in there. What?? So odd.

Our server Gina was oh so patient and friendly, and was never too far away. Prices are way higher than your average taqueria, but this is what I would call an &#34;upscale taqueria&#34;, so you are paying for the more inventive menu, and a slick atmosphere, which I&#39;m okay with. Our upgraded appetizer, two non-alcoholic drinks, 5 tacos and 2 sides, plus the complimentary chips and divine salsa totaled about $48!! That&#39;s pretty high but I have to say, most everything was so good, I just don&#39;t mind. I ate my calories tonight, but I intend to drink some next visit as the margaritas and other cocktails looked pretty good to me. :) So I may have dragged the hubs in, but suffice it to say, we both definitely rolled out of there with very full and happy bellies! ;)"

Got to sample/try pretty much all of the tacos, mole fries, and nachos gringos. 

Let me start off by saying these are not your typical Mexican tacos. Each taco has their own special twist such as nopales on a taco, the pastor taco has pineapple, the asada taco has avocado and cheese. Some of the tacos had some green sauce which was pretty spicy and also the pulpo (octupus) taco had a little bite at the end! You&#39;ve been warned!!

Drinks are great! Tried the Rita margarita and it was very refreshing but they have a good selection of beers, tequila, and mezcal. 

The restaurant is conveniently located next to the movie theater so I would come back to grab a quick bite before catching a movie or vice versa. Cheers to Chef Juan on yet another great Mexican restaurant!"

Just had a quick bite since we had dinner plans later, but the tacos were awesome. Highly recommend trying the swordfish tacos, we both liked those even more than the steak!

Let&#39;s break it down quickly - 

Drinks: I had the blood orange mojito and it was really good; reminded me of when we were in Costa Rica. On anther visit, my friend got a traditional margarita and it was probably one of the best margaritas I have ever had. They had a pretty decent selection for beer; although the waitress did forget to remind us that there two sides to the menu (that was clipped to a clipboard and not necessarily easy or intuitive to look on the back) - to be nit-picking.

Atmosphere: It was really nice; very clean, approachable, bright, casual, and colorful. This is definitely a place that I could bring my family [two smaller children] or go on a date with just my husband. Always seems that the place has a good amount of people in it but enough seating to accommodate. 

Food: The 60% of this equation and probably the reason this is a 3/5 star review. The first time, my friend and I got guacamole, and then tacos. The guacamole was fine but what I really liked with the guac was that they served it with fried plantain chips. I had the mahi fish taco; which was also ok but probably lacked a little more flavor. 

The second time I came my husband and I got the shrimp ceviche to start. I thought it was ok; I love the plantain chips that they give with it and the shrimp tasted good but there was a little too much tomato and olive. Next time I would probably try the other type of ceviche. For entrees - my husband got the gringo nachos and I got the costilla tacos. Both had short rib as the main protein and, unfortunately, we both found the short rib to be a little dry and pretty salty. I was pretty excited about the Costilla tacos as I love corn and was excited for the corn esquites. I also thought the tamarind chile guajillo bbq sauce sounded really good but when I got the taco, I found that there was not enough of the sauce. I think if someone orders it, they should ask for a side of that bbq sauce. My husband&#39;s nachos were also dry and i would have also suggested extra tamarind bbq sauce. If the meat was not as salty I think we would have really enjoyed dinner but the main flavor was salt.

I will probably try it again as I really do like the atmosphere and drinks; maybe that was a one off time but if you are looking for authentic mexican this would probably not be my first suggestion."

So skeptical me was not buying it but I took a look at the burger menu and it caught my eye - The Mar y Tierra:  two patties, jalapeno jack cheese, guacamole, habanero mayo topped with a crispy bacon wrapped shrimp on a brioche bun.  One bite and I must admit, Peter was right when he said that I won&#39;t regret ordering it.  It was one of the best and tastiest burgers I&#39;ve ever had.  
We also tried the camaron taco and carne asada - delicious.  I love the arugula, pumpkin seeds and goat cheese with the camaron.

The interesting tacos are what called out to me while looking over the menu, so the two of us decided to try 4 different kinds. All of the tacos have unique vegetables and sauces, which I found to be delicious! 

Things to note:
No, this is not street food - these are gourmet tacos
Tacos are reasonably priced: 2 for $7 of the same kind or $4 each 
Quality ingredients - no chunks of fat or gristle was in the steak (yay!)
Horchata was sweet and creamy: $3 for about 16 oz glass 

Description of tacos we tried: 
PESCADO - Negra modelo beer-battered Alaskan cod, chipotle cole slaw
COCHINITA PIBIL - Yucatan-style pulled pork, chile habanero, purple onions, cilantro
COSTILLA - Braised short rib, tamarind chile guajillo,bbq, corn esquites, cilantro, serrano peppers
CARNE ASADA - Charbroiled sirloin steak, goat cheese-chile morita, cream sauce, onions, 
avocado, cilantro, farmers cheese

My favorite was the carne asada, because I loved the quality of the steak (note to the Chef: please don&#39;t ever change this, and I&#39;ll be loyal forever!)
My husband also enjoyed the carne asada, but really liked the pescado (cod) taco with the creamy cole slaw. 

We each tried all 4 (8 total tacos), but definitely couldn&#39;t finish them, so we have a whole other meal. I want to come back and try the rest!  Also looking forward to trying a margarita

If you enjoy &#34;tasting&#34; different foods, it&#39;s a great idea to come with a few friends and order a variety of the tacos.  

The only minor complaint was that we sat in the half booth, half chair section, and the tables there are so close to one another, that you can&#39;t help hearing your neighboring table&#39;s conversation. I like more privacy, but unfortunately they don&#39;t have any booths. So maybe not the ideal &#34;date night&#34; spot where you can talk dirty to your mate, but perfectly fine for families and friends."

They are attempting to bring high quality Mexican cuisine to the burbs (think Rick Bayless). And I have appreciated their efforts three times already. The service is cheerful, attentive, and friendly. On one visit, my daughter (a foodie from birth) grilled the server on the English translations of the Mexican ingredients described on the menus. He was knowledgable and thorough in his explanations. Everything I have tried has been spot on. Tacos I have tasted: Camaron, lamb chorizo, braised short rib, pulled pork. My favorites were the shrimp and ribs. They still have you order two of the same but if you bring a friend, it&#39;s pretty easy to go tapas on this menu. My daughter tried the pulpo, and it was HOT (the waiter warned her, but she plunged in anyway).  He nicely brought her a cup of sour cream to cool the fire. I have also tried the queso fundido, which comes with half flour and half corn tortillas (it would be possible to get all of one kind if you ask). The sopes were amazing--deep mushroom flavor, delicious corn cakes under the shrooms, nice spicy green sauce underneath. The Plantanos I have had three times. If the plantain is very ripe, this is a sweet dish. If the plantain is less ripe, it will be more starchy. Either way, it&#39;s covered with some fresh cheese and sour cream and is really more of a dessert than a side. Eat dessert first. 
     The atmosphere here is like a hipster urban sports bar. They have a wall of TVs that show music videos and sports and news. (Music videos--how 1983!! And therefore super hip!). The walls are white, ceilings and windows high, floor concrete, accent colors a pop of hot tropical vibe. Oh, the the TV wall is surrounded by a shrine of Oscar-statuette-like tequila bottles that are topped by skulls. The bar faces a huge window and only one TV. I did try one cocktail, and it was sooooo tasty I can&#39;t remember what it was. Bring me another!  Despite my description, there were families with kids here on each visit and they seemed very comfortable here. 
     The menu is clearly labelled with gluten free and vegetarian items. I&#39;m no vegan, but a quick glance made me think you could get the V items to vegan often by the omission of cheese. 
     Check them out!  A great complement to our local places!"

I ordered a burger, its more of a big cooked meatball on a bun. Does not taste grilled. The taste is more like ham then hamburger. I only ate a little, its not the right taste for a burger. The fries all were burnt for everyone, this really is not my type of food.

Don&#39;t buy the burgers here, they don&#39;t taste like burgers, fries are burnt, chips don&#39;t taste good.

I ordered a trio of three different tacos - short rib, pulled pork and carne asada. Carne asada was my favorite by far, though they all were good. Husband had the chicken enchilada, which seemed more like a chimichanga and came with fries, which I thought was weird for a Mexican place. Mojito was good and they had a decent cocktail and beer selection. 

The place was busy for a Friday night, but the wait wasn&#39;t terribly long. Nice ambiance. 

The only negative about our visit was the service. While our server was nice enough, he would completely disappear at times. This meant we had to wait long after we were ready to order drinks and food. We didn&#39;t bother getting second drinks because by the time we were checked on again, we were ready to go.

-1: They did not have anyone greeting us at the door, so we awkwardly stood there for 2 minutes until a waitress asked us if we needed a table. We actually decided to just sit at the bar since there was only one other couple there, and she said you could order food from the bartender.

-2: The bartender was behind the bar, but took 10 minutes to take our drink order. At this time we decided we should order our food as well.

+1: ordered a drink called Jamica, it was really tasty.

-3: our food, we both ordered tacos (shrimp tacos and Carne asada) took 40 minutes to make. They were bland and unexciting. Not worth the wait.

-4: during this 40 minute wait our drinks were drunk (imagine that) but the bartender was barely there for us to ask for another, and he never offered us another. When we got our food we had to eat it while sucking the ice out of our cups. Not one staff member noticed this, or would make eye contact with us to ask for a water or another drink.

We consider ourselves foodies and like to experience new things in and out of our area.  Came in during the week for lunch and immediately were in awe of what a cool space this place has.  Beautiful and interesting art decorates the walls with a modern feel.  

Service was overall the most disappointing factor of our visit to Truco.  We are pretty laid back, but the younger server that was working was incredibly inattentive and we waited about 15 minutes for our drink order.  Sadly, there were only two other tables of guests in the restaurant, so this was slightly annoying. We also never received water or were given the option.  An order of guacamole was placed as an app, and that came out moderately quickly and was delicious.  

About 5 minutes after our app came out, a man (whom may have been the owner/manager) came out with our entrees.  The table was pretty small, and the guacamole and our app plates took up most of the table space.  He stood next to our table, slightly annoyed, holding our tacos.  We joked that we were out of room and received no response.  So, we (ourselves) moved our app plates to the empty table next to us so he could set our entrees down.  Get a clue, man!  Hilariously, our dirty plates stayed on the empty table next to us throughout the rest of our meal and were never removed. 

Overall, the food lacked seasoning, which is funny after reading a multitude of reviews stating their food was too salty.  The guacamole was the best thing we ordered.  My wife had an order of shrimp tacos with rice, and I had both a mahi and pastor taco with beans.  She had wanted to order two different tacos, but &#34;wasn&#39;t allowed&#34; because the side of rice or beans would be an extra charge if the two tacos weren&#39;t the same. *Confused*. I paid the extra $4 for my beans to sample two different tacos. They were &#34;meh&#34; and under-seasoned.  

This place could be great. They have a wonderful location, interesting menu, and (from what I hear) a very experienced and inventive chef.  However, the odd and poorly executed service overshadowed our experience and I don&#39;t think we will be returning."

When the there is a pattern of reviews that say the food is salty, you need to cut back on the salt. Guacamole: salty. Rice: salty.  Beans: salty. Tacos: salty.
What drew us in?  After eating across the street a couple of weeks ago, saw big letters on the sign in the back of the restaurant: cochinita pibil, mole poblano, tortas. Mmm.  Not your typical &#39;Mexican&#39; taco, enchilada grub. Menu continued to intrigue - more than a dozen different types of tacos with a variety of inspired combinations.
Tried to order 2 different tacos in my order, but that wasn&#39;t allowed. Really??  They need to be more flexible. It&#39;s not like cochinita pibil, barbacoa and braised short ribs are made to order.  Sadly you are left without an option to sample more than 1 of the appealing choices. Also, it would be nice to have the option of adding a 3rd taco onto the order. See where I&#39;m going?  Sample 3...  By the way, I did order the cochinita pibil and asked if I would have to shoot the cook after I ate it (ala Once Upon a Time in Mexico; if it was too good; to restore the balance...).  I don&#39;t think anyone there has seen the movie which, along with being a great movie, came with director Robert Rodriguez&#39; recipe for puerco pibil.
Other comments - great chips and salsa (always a good indicator in a Mexican restaurant); tiny margaritas, good mojitos; a little pricey. 
Will I come back?  Definitely. There are still a number of things I&#39;m looking forward to try. Hopefully with less salt next time."

For starters, they give you 3 fried corn tortillas and a couple of dipping sauces. I guess this is their version of chips and salsa. The one sauce tasted like liquefied refried beans. For my entrée, I went with the Barbacoa tacos, which is basically the shredded chicken tacos on a corn tortilla (flour available upon request). They had a list of tacos to pick from (all $7) and you get two tacos, but you are not allowed to mix and match your two tacos. I don&#39;t see why this rule is in place given that they are all the same price anyway. My taco lacked flavor and the chicken was on the cool side.

She kept walking by and you think she&#39;ll check on you, but total obliviousness and weird attitude.  Not welcoming or personable at all.  I hope they fix this because they don&#39;t deserve to have bad waitstaff after all the money that was apparently invested.  

The food:  The chips were good.  

That&#39;s it.  We had 2 dinners and unfortunately we&#39;re not fans.  I can see the chefs work hard, but I would find it hard to believe they think much of anything that&#39;s put out tastes authentic.  I grew up on 26th street &amp; East side Mexican food, so it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t know what&#39;s good on the tongue."

I ordered the best margarita ever...it was far from best. It was way too sweet and had little to no booze and was served by a bartender that hated his job. They brought out tortillas and salsa which consisted of a liquified guacamole and a bean dip. My friend ordered a grapefruit margarita that wasn&#39;t any good either. I had high hopes because Mago is amazing. Willing to give it another try but not impressed on round 1.

Also ordered the Chopped Ensalada and that had absolutely no flavor (the menu said there was some kind of vinaigrette) but I didn&#39;t taste anything but jalapeños and leafs that were just dry.  

The environment is nice and the place is very modern. Our waitress was friendly but not very helpful. She recommended the only thing that I liked: my house special margarita. 

Overall, this was definitely a waste of money ($80). I think this place has potential because of the location but the menu needs a fix."

-Some of food was excellent. 
-Much of the food was not...
-Some of the tacos I had were super salty
-The tortillas which they provide in lieu of chips were not enough when compared to a typical bowl of table chips.
- The menu descriptions were not completely accurate for a number of our items.
- The food took a very long to make it to the table. 
- Numerous staff members were joking around or on their phones when tables were waiting for refills, bussing, orders, etc...

Started off as a bad visit as my friend almost face plants on the entrance floor for a poorly placed rug and wet floor. Then we get in and there is no hostess... she is running all over the place as a line builds. Then when she returns she goes to the people behind us and doesn&#39;t even acknowledge that we were standing there in front of them. The gentleman behind us was nice enough to point out that we were first. Then they seat us at a table with one chair and bring in a little uncomfortable metal chair for me to sit on when there was an extra normal chair at the table next door (which they later exchanged at our request). They then brought my friend the wrong drink which she was too nice to return. And my Margarita with salt had a giant blob of salt on the side of the glass... which is super weird as I&#39;m not going to lick the side of the glass for salt... that&#39;s just gross. The chaos calmed down a little after we were brought our food... which was slightly over mediocre. The waitress we ended up with was at least attentive and friendly but the bus boy kept trying to take away our half eaten food while we were still working. I want to like this place but the awful service left a bad taste in my mouth. Meh. Also the food was way over priced... 7 dollars for 2 tacos (with no rice or beans) and you can&#39;t mix them. That doesn&#39;t even make sense, what difference does it make. Also the full corn tortilla is not a hip way to reinvent the chip... it&#39;s just annoying. I give this place 6 months."

The executive chef is the guy from Mago in downtown Arlington, so that might give you an idea of the flavor palette he likes to work with. For what it&#39;s worth, i think truco is wayyy better than mago. It feels more casual and street style (minus the lard).

Food was not consistent. Sangria was great but pricey. Chips and salsa are amazing. Tacos, which I loved last time had to be sent back because the fish was overcooked and chewy.

The restaurant: beautiful. Colorful, great open seating, two floors. I was very impressed. Very nicely decorated just a beautiful space. I liked the modern bathroom.
The food: I got an assortment of tacos. Firstly they come on corn tortillas not my most favorite but I saw you could ask for flour after the fact. I got mahi mahi- this was not the best. It wasn&#39;t flavored well not enough salt and the quality of the fish wasn&#39;t my favorite. The shrimp were better they have pumpkin seeds in them and some kind of creamy sauce I liked it. The best were these vegetarian poblano tacos. Watch out-they are spicy! But really good! It&#39;s a crunchy soft combo so I liked it texture-wise as well as flavor wise it was a big hit with me. I also got an appetizer of corn with cheese and mayo? Or sour cream? I dunno it was good but I didn&#39;t understand if I was supposed to eat it plain or with chips; do I did both and it was good both ways. It is a dish served warm. The house salsa I really liked, it was flavorful and really good. I agree with the other yelpers, the whole tortilla as an appetizer is awkward. Mine was fried not soft but you had to break them and stuff, I could have done without the extra work.
The service: I went at an off time so it was quick people were friendly but no one asked me to sit while I was waiting for my food and it was 15-20 min. It would have been nice to be asked.
Price wise: ~$25 for what I got, not amazing but not horrible. It was a lot of food so it was ok.

My son had carne asada tacos - yum! The frijoles ranchero were spicy, but good. The esquites - supposed to be roasted corn - I think was canned corn.

None of these were outstanding; just okay. My husband said his fish tacos were just okay but he thought the frijoles were outstanding. The service was weird. We were there last  Friday night and there was hardly anyone there. We had a young lady server who was overly friendly with my husband but would not look at me - even taking my order. He asked me the next day if I thought there was something funny about the server and mentioned that he noticed she wouldn&#39;t interact with me. Maybe she thinks she will get a better tip from focusing on men? Not sure but it was very strange.

why are you tasty?.. I get tempted when I enter Taco Bell with all the options....it looks tasty...well some of the photos do at least....and the prices are reasonable... ~$5 for 2 tacos and they have some deals under $10..... not bad...

I used to go to Taco Bell almost once every week in the past (3 yrs ago) to accommodate for my vegetarian friend/co-worker during lunch time... I did slowly get sick of eating it on a weekly basis......but sometimes... if you don&#39;t eat it in awhile.. you begin to kind of sort of miss it....ignoring the fact that it has bad quality meat.... my mind says no, but my mouth says yes...

I think Taco Bell is a ideal cheap fast food option for vegetarians only because the meat quality is bad.. so it&#39;s probably healthier to go with tacos w/out the meat.....and just replace everything with beans..hoping that it doesn&#39;t create you too much flatulence...hah....but seriously...cheap...fast..good...

This location&#39;s drive through is really really busy, but the sit-in is pretty empty....I&#39;ll see older couples or young high school students here often...

Food:
Nacho Cheese Locos Tacos: I love the shell...but it&#39;s very fragile.. it breaks very easily so eating the taco can get messy...maybe you can just get a bowl and crush everything together...tasted delicious.. :) 

Cheese Nachos: just cheese poured over tortilla chips... $0.99...I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.. get $0.99 fries instead.. it&#39;s very bland... and the cheese quality doesn&#39;t seem that great.. and they don&#39;t give you a lot of cheese.. :( ....

Cooler Ranch Locos Tacos: sorry... this is on my next to-try list... my friend tried it and said it tasted good...hope that helps...

Customer Service:
The cashier was friendly but it seemed like she didn&#39;t know how to fully use the register...the customer in front of me wanted more time to think so he told me to go first... so that would mean she would have to void his order.. but she didn&#39;t know how to...so she went to the drive-thru cashier and entered in my order... i thought that was really odd....hm...


I&#39;ll come back again for 1 taco... every visit = 1 taco only... :)"

We noticed the guy in the car in front of us had a large order, but as he waited in front of us for his food and almost half an hour went by, we got more and more irritated. Why wouldn&#39;t they ask him to pull forward into a parking space, so the line can continue moving and not hold up the??? That would be common sense right - clearly too much to ask. When we pulled up to get our food, we quick a quick appology.

Both locations look virtually identical and have the same very limited menu:burgers, hot dogs, fries and overpriced soft drinks.

I had a double bacon cheeseburger, hot dog and Cajun fries. Granted, this is a lot of food that isn&#39;t exactly healthy, but it&#39;s my choice.

The burger and grilled hot dog were well up to Five Guys standards, which is to say fairly tasty, fresh and seemingly made to order. The bacon cheeseburger featured a nice sesame seed bun, a decent amount of bacon and an ample portion of nicely melted cheese. Their beef is only mediocre (there&#39;s nothing juicy about it) and they tend to overcook which makes it somewhat dry.  

The fries, which is usually their strong point were positively AWFULL. It was apparent they had been cooked long before I placed the order and had been lying around. They were hard with an unpleasant harsh taste. They may have been heated up just before they were served as the outsides were mostly burnt.

Had I been dining in I most likely would have demanded a replacement or a refund. I ordered for carryout and it shouldn&#39;t be necessary for a customer to have to sample their food before leaving the premises.

An experience like this makes me reluctant to return to ANY Five Guys location."

However, I had never been to a Five Guys before, and it was so damn good they deserved a review.

Their fries are amazing. The burgers are perfect. They don&#39;t serve much more than that, but what they do serve is fantastic.

It&#39;s on the pricier side for burgers but it&#39;s a gourmet burger!  And yes a burger is automatically a double and you completely build your order down to every ingredient.

Not all of them offer the ultimate Coca-Cola dispenser but they all have unlimited peanuts to giveaway.

Burger v. Little Burger is the difference of one hamburger patty. They also sell Hot Dogs and Fries.

Their list of complimentary toppings is generous. I like mine with ketchup, mustard, American cheese and pickles.

Good tasting burger, prepared to order and cooked until the cheese is melted to perfection. The potatoes are fresh, cut and fried on premise.

They need toothpicks for when the sesame seed from the bun lodges between your teeth.

Quality = Quantity. In case you don&#39;t get it: Expect to pay more for better quality food. Don&#39;t let their prices intimidate you. Here&#39;s what we do to keep our tab under $20:

HIM= Burger w/ Bacon &amp; American Cheese, Small Fries, Soda
 ME= Little Burger w/ American Cheese

It&#39;s always one of those places mentioned when people talk about quality, outstanding fast-food.

For the most part I agree, the burgers are cooked to order, served hot, and taste very fresh, both the beef and the condiments. The fries are excellent, some of the best I&#39;ve ever had, fresh-cut, skin-on, served piping hot. Delicious food no doubt.

Now for the negatives. First of all it&#39;s just way too expensive. I expect these higher quality burger joints to be more expensive than the huge multinational chains, but a single &#34;small&#34; cheeseburger, small coke and small order of fries should NOT come out to over $10. The burger was most certainly delicious but a the patty was a little thin for a $5 burger.

Another fault is that Five Guys falls into the American cliche of serving ridiculously huge portions of their food. The &#34;small&#34; order of fries (costing $3) is enormous, I could only eat about half of them, and I was more hungry than usual. I can&#39;t imagine anyone ordering the large fries, unless it was to share with several other people. Why can&#39;t they just sell truly small order of fries for $1.50? It would still be a good portion of fries (like a typical medium fries at most places) and it would drive the price of the meal down to about $8, which would be a a little more forgiving to both the wallet, and the waistline."

The burgers seem to have shrunk over time, yet the prices seem to keep going up.  Nothing was wrong with the burger I had - it tasted good, but when we got the burger we looked at it and said &#34;where&#39;s the beef?&#34;  The thickness of the patties is now about as thick as something from any fast food place...which wasn&#39;t the case when Five Guys first opened... 

With respect to this particular location, compared to other locations I&#39;ve been to, this was probably the least busy - but that may have been due to it being a holiday?  Not sure.  

I am not sure that great fries would make me a regular customer...now if they added a great milkshake that would be a whole other story!!"

The fries are also freshly cut and delicious!

I saw this on my way to a referee clinic, and had to make it for lunch.  I had tried Five Guys based on a friend&#39;s suggestion, and man, was it good.  The key was: is the formula location specific?

The good news - it isn&#39;t.  I got the same juicy burger with fries (and when you ask for fries, you always get more that you bargained or paid for) that I got from the Omaha location, with great service and a clean restaurant.  It&#39;s so much better than the standard fast food - the burgers are made as you watch - no drawer burgers here, the fries were made fresh, and well, it&#39;s just darn good.

Why 5 stars for non-haute cuisine?  Because it rates it.  This must be fairly new, since I don&#39;t see a lot of reviews, and there weren&#39;t many customers on the day I went (11/30/13).  I have no idea why - great burger, great service.  Just a great time."

We placed a large catering order for a birthday party and I was an hour late to pick up the food, so they had to sell the chicken so it wouldn&#39;t get cold/go to waste. No problem! They have so much of their tender and delicious chicken being cooked all the time they were able to redo the order in like 5 minutes. The chicken is served with tons of grilled onions, and the beans were very good as well."

And all your orders come with corn tortillas! and when you having family over I just call and order the tray w like whatever you like 3 or 5 chicken&#39;s and I can assure you everyone will love it! if you don&#39;t like it something wrong with you! :) :)

All I can say is that, THE CHICKEN IS AWESOME !!!
I got half a chicken, corn tortillas 2 sides and a drink for under $10
The chicken is moist and tender with great flavor ! I will admit the place could be a little cleaner on the inside.
But the food makes up for it and they have a salsa bar. So far the 3 salsas I got today are yummy.
So if you are in the mood for GREAT grilled chicken stop by, WAY better than any other chicken place I have found.
I am glad I work in Elgin, I will be going there a lot !!!
Staff was super friendly and got my food very quick.
Please check them out !"

She brought us LCdPA again, and we were hooked! The chicken is absolutely delicious and juicy, and the sides are also very good. They serve their chicken in four sizes: 1 1/2, whole, half, or quarter. You can get either the grilled chicken (asado) or the BBQ (en salsa barbeque). We&#39;ve gotten the grilled chicken, which is bursting with flavor (especially since the skin is left on) and is accented well by the grilled green onions and jalapenos that come with.  

I recommend picking up a &#34;Family Order.&#34; That comes with either 1 grilled or BBQ chicken, which is cut up into 8 pieces or 1 1/2 grilled or BBQ chicken, which is cut up into 12 pieces, plus your choice of three sides. The beans are excellent, although they are not what you might think of when you think of Mexican-style beans. These beans come with more broth and have pieces of bacon floating around in all that brothy goodness. I don&#39;t even like beans, and I found myself gobbling these up. We also get the rice and the chips / guacamole, which are both very good. There&#39;s also a salsa station where you can pick from an array of sauces. 

The prices are very reasonable and the food is great. For $15-$20, you get a delicious, well-balanced and fairly large meal. You can&#39;t beat that! So skip that KFC or Popeye&#39;s family meal and head over to La Casa del Pollo Asado! (I understand that LCdPA and KFC / Popeye&#39;s serve different kinds of chicken, but with the family meals you&#39;re essentially getting the same thing: chicken + sides)."

My younger, adult son joined us.  Each of the three of us is a self-proclaimed connoisseur of Mexican cuisine.  Anyway, we know our way around the cocina.

Who doesn&#39;t like grilled chicken and/or steaks?  The House of Grilled Chicken will traject your tastebuds lightyears from backyard grilling.  It&#39;s all in the preparation, seasoning, and the Scrumptious Sauce &amp; Scallions that provoke your taste buds to scream for more while your stomach &#34;yelps&#34; back &#34;Take it home - no more freak&#39;n room down here!&#34;.

I&#39;ve been eating beans and rice all my life.  With all respect to my late mother&#39;s beans these frijoles are a very close 2nd and the fluffy Mexican rice is a tantalizing accompaniment.  

The guacamole is of perfect taste and consistency.  Do you like salsa?  Nothing like the variety of Salsa selection that they offer here.  Checkout the Salsa bar once you pickup your meal.

It&#39;s a fun place, but the atmosphere is not fancy or memorable with Mariachi music in the background.  La Casa Del Pollo Asado is a self-service, clean restaurant with a very friendly and courteous staff.  They have been in business for over two years.  Plenty of parking in the open, free parking lot about 40 yds away.

But...their new Smokehouse sandwiches are pretty darn good.

My coworkers and I went with the purpose of trying their Limited Time Smoke Sandwiches. We were impressed! Well....they didn&#39;t look as they did in the commercials but they were nearly as beastly! Piled with meats including pork belly and overall, surprisingly good! Maybe because we went in with low expectations but these sandwiches were honestly better than we anticipated.

We ordered a chicken sandwich and the advertised Brown Sugar Bacon BLT (Redundant, I know...) and curly fries.

Because of previous experiences at other Arby&#39;s, I asked for the chicken to be dropped fresh, which took a few minutes but was more than reasonable.

The BLT was very good! My wife enjoyed the bacon, and the sandwich was a good portion for a meal.

The chicken was quite warm, but not hot. Not dropped fresh, but the curly fries were. Apparently a mix up in communication. The sandwich was still decent, and properly hot, so I didn&#39;t worry about telling them.

She had the manager reverse the charges on my card. She told me that it would be 3 to 5 business days before I get my funds back. I was soooo pissed! You mean to tell me that I have to wait 3 to 5 business days (weekends not included) before I can get my money back because of your mistake?! Noooo, I need my money back right now! Just like you took my money instantly, I need it back instantly! I asked to speak with her supervisor. She apologized like it was no big deal. The tone of her voice sounded like she didn&#39;t care. The least she could&#39;ve done was to compensate me some sort of way. My coworker suggested I should call corporate on them, and that&#39;s exactly what I did. I took down her name and told her that I would call corporate on them. I called the corporate office in Georgia and filed my complaint. I got a call from the regional manager later that afternoon. He offered me 3 free meals. The next day, I got my &#34;VIP cards&#34; for the next three days and I used them. That is the only reason why they got 3 stars instead of 1.

Now that I&#39;m thinking about it, a conflict ensues when she becomes hungry and asks me where I want to eat. Today, I wanted Fried Rice; but, my mom didn&#39;t want Chinese food as soon as she called Chef Ping to place an order and found out the restaurant is closed on Mondays.

Both of us agreeing with Thai for lunch was too good to be true. She showed me a menu from a place she recently tried with her boyfriend and I wasn&#39;t impressed. It took my finesse and this app for her to cooperate with me.

Yelp provided over one hundred reviews but it was someone&#39;s photo of their  Shrimp Pad Nar that won me over. I don&#39;t even know how many times I skipped over this place because of its curious name. Now, Thai Little Home has us wanting more!

The food here is close to authentic as you can find in the area.  They have really good lunch specials which are served with an egg roll, chicken satay, pad thai(no meat) and fried rice(no meat) all for $7.25

There is ample seating space and the service is quick.  The place is SO unassuming as it looked like it was empty from the outside.  I visited on a Thursday and the place was full of visitors eating their delicious food.  I&#39;m pretty surprised that the area doesn&#39;t have more Quality Thai restaurants but this place definitely fits the bill.

I would definitely recommend this place if you&#39;re looking for a somewhat authentic Thai restaurant in the Arlington Hts / Schaumburg area."

Im a sucker for good crab rangoon, so I order that plus the spicy chicken lunch special, which was ambitious. I knew they had larger portions with cheap prices, but I can eat a lot.  Anyways, it was good, but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. With that being said, I still ate most of my meal only taking home a little box.

The crab rangoons were small and crispy. I feel like they could have added more cream cheese/ crab filling. 

The egg role in the lunch special was bomb, but everything else was pretty average. My spicy chicken was not spicy at all. I think they didn&#39;t put the sauce on it? 

Pro tip: Use the spoon they give you for the Pad Thai. I know some people are probably rolling their eyes at how obvious this suggestion is, but they cut the noodles up into tiny pieces which makes it hard to manage with a fork alone.

I would recommend coming here, but don&#39;t hype it up too much to friends or colleagues."

I recommend coming here for the lunch special from 11 AM - 2:30 PM, Monday - Friday (the restaurant is closed on Wednesdays, though). You&#39;ll get a lot for $7.25 (There&#39;s a $2 upcharge for a dish with shrimp or squid). With your choice of Pad Khee Mao, Pad See Ewe, a Thai Basil dish with your choice of meat or tofu,  a red curry dish with your choice of meat or tofu, plus four other dishes, you can&#39;t go wrong. Each lunch special comes with an egg roll, chicken satay, Pad Thai (meatless), and fried rice (meatless).  I typically get the Beef Pad See Ewe, which is always good. In particular, I like how the dish has the perfect balance of noodles, meat, and Chinese broccoli. 

As for the restaurant&#39;s other offerings, we enjoy the shrimp toast and the Thai calamari. The individual pieces of toast and calamari are big. Both dishes have a nice batter on them. I particularly like the Thai calamari&#39;s delicate batter, which allows the calamari to largely stand on its own. 

The service here is fast, and you&#39;ll get the attention you need even if there are lots of diners. You shouldn&#39;t have a problem finding seating here either. Just walk right in - no fuss.

We ordered a mussels appetizer - it was my colleagues first time having mussels.  They were in a flavorful broth, but some of them were gritty so meh.  Also ordered a chicken satay app - that was delicious.  Perfectly cooked chicken with a succulent peanut sauce.

For dinner we ordered the same dish prepared with two different meats - this is where it gets weird.  So I am sitting there devouring my dinner and I notice that my colleague doesn&#39;t appear to be enjoying his.  I asked him about it and he said it was not great - since I loved mine, I wondered if it was him or me.  Turns out that even though they were the same dish, mine was WAY better.  I am not sure how the beef or chicken affected this, but its like we were eating two different things.  

The service was abysmally slow, I think due to the fact that they had a large birthday party.

The service is pleasant, but a little inconsistent.  Also, there are a few tables on the West side of the restaurant where there is a TV and they do some set up.

I wish I saw Candice&#39;s review before I went. BYOB is the bestest! Duly noted for next time.

Thai Little Home Cafe is tucked away in this rundown strip mall but is nice on the inside - nicer than what you&#39;d think you would find here. We went in with the intentions of having a very fast lunch to make a movie and it happened just as we needed to. We ordered, the food came out really quickly and they were fast about bringing our bill and running our card. Plus they were on top of refilling our drinks through the meal.

I ordered the Chicken Pad See Ewe and loved it! It was a big portion for a good price. The chicken was super moist and cooked just the right amount. The noodles in the dish were great. Overall, loved what I ate!

Starting with the Tom Yum Kai soup.  It is coconut milk based which has a unique taste. I did not find it spicy.  I did kick it up a notch with chili sauce. Chicken and mushrooms were very satisfying.  Large enough to share. Temperature was almost perfect, I am not a fan of Luke warm soup.  Would have been perfect on a really cold night. I ate maybe half of the soup.

Next was an eggplant dish with beef.  Advertised as a spicy dish, I found it tame but very tasty.  The beef was just a bit chewy, but when eaten with the eggplant and julienned carrots, it was a wonderful explosion of tastes.  The serving size was just right, not overwhelming. Especially after the soup.

Even though I was the only person in the restaurant, the rice was perfect.  Not mushy at all so it had to have been pretty freshly made.  That is a big deal. 

Not entirely done, probably over did it with the homemade coconut ice cream.  It was the only thing that was just okay.

All for $18.69 plus tip.  Worth every penny.  You don&#39;t have to spend a fortune to have an enjoyable meal.

Once again the yelp community was right on. Thank you.  I travel a lot and depend on your comments."

Appetizers: 

Fish cakes - amazing -- it may sound different, but you will not be disappointed. 

Fried wontons - cheap and addicting. Not going to fill you, but are very tasty.

Satay Chicken - fantastic, it&#39;s good sized portion for the price, although it may seem pricey.


Main Dishes:

Pad see ewe - adored by my sister.  She gets this once a week to keep her sanity, I think. 

Chicken with egg noodle - beloved by family and guests when I serve this.

Fried Rice Dishes - would take a punch from Mike Tyson for ...


The FRIED RICE is amazing and is better than any place you can go to, even high priced chains.  Do yourself a favor and get beef fried rice from here.


Other thoughts:

Still home ran by the family who had it in Chicago for years when my parents were just in their 20s (they&#39;re in 60s now).  Still roll the napkins and silverware the same way.  Always a friendly staff.

Red sauce on the table is traditional Thai spicy and is delicious.



Key Money Savor:   

BYOB


Bring a cheap bottle of wine from Trader Joe&#39;s and you&#39;re going to pay $40 for 2 people with a bunch of appetizers and left overs. Great for a casual date night OR a new date where you want to impress your significant other with amazing food so that you look like a connoisseur. 

Final Thoughts:


I no longer order Chinese. Thai Little Home ALL DAY.


Message to the owners:


Thanks for moving 5 minutes from me when we originally lived off Lawerence and Kedzie and you were the same distance away.  Rock on!"
thai-little-home-cafe-arlington-heights,Sethu M.,_3FKvELgV4XA0aSSXGaU_g,"Vernon Hills, IL",0,1,0,0,213,EHGf-NbIhl1L6dn6c0R9PA,5.0,2014-12-06,"Went here for lunch on two occasions this past week. Both times I ordered from their lunch special menu. Both times the food was consistent and the portion was huge enough that I couldn&#39;t even finish it. The fact I liked the most is that the food seemed &#39;clean&#39;...meaning I was convinced that they properly washed and prepped the food before cooking it unlike some other Asian restaurants I have been to in past where the chicken would smell like old rags.
Their service is also amazing....perfect in my mind. The morning server is really quite but extremely observant. As soon as you enter the door, she will be waiting with the menus and as soon as you wipe your hands with the napkin after your meal, she will be ready with your check. She does everything in extreme stealth mode and doesn&#39;t always hover over you for the type of service she provides. She should be truly rewarded because in my mind a good server is not someone who can chat up a storm but someone who is attentive, quick and effective. So full points on that. 
I also don&#39;t agree with any one star reviews. One star should be reserved for a place that is horrible in all aspects and doesn&#39;t even try to improve. You can&#39;t possibly give a small business one star because your one item wasn&#39;t up to your standards based on just one visit. It could mean a death sentence for them when they are just trying to do their best. And by no means this restaurant is so bad that it deserves such a low rating....that&#39;s just my opinion.

Con&#39;s:
Noodles were over cooked, super soft and way too oily, order Basil or Cashew instead if you&#39;d like to avoid noodles or give it try, maybe they have improved it already.

Pro&#39;s
Clean
Huge portions
Consistent food
Cheap
Awesome service
Balanced lunch special
Awesome chicken and pad Thai

Will be back next week to try something new. Thanks."
thai-little-home-cafe-arlington-heights,Keith R.,tQOVsJoOYwoPMIGkkPIfDA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,231,8,jbN9aPTp9XR28bB76iC_Aw,4.0,2014-09-24,"So my company sent me to work east of my &#39;hood, in Arlington Heights. At about 1pm I had the option of taking off or sticking around for another two hours. Most days, I&#39;d stick around and work, but I was feeling a bit hangry as I wasn&#39;t given a break or lunch during my shift so I decided to leave and go on a sort of food adventure. 

As I&#39;m not usually around these parts during the lunch hour on a weekday, I browsed Yelp for some helpful options and lo and behold, this place popped up on my screen, and they happen to be BYOB too. Day drinking on a Monday? Too bad I forgot to walk to the liquor store at the other end of parking lot. A tasty dobbelbock sounded really good...But anyways...

 A quick glance at the lunch special menu and I knew what I wanted within 30 seconds. Beef pad see ewe spicy, which comes with a side of plain fried rice(what?) and a side of no meat pad thai(double what??) and an egg roll and a single chicken satay(triple and quadruple what????).

My only issue is this: I&#39;m a last bite of the candy bar kind of person. See, in my worldview, there are two types of people; first bite of the candy bar people, and last bite of the candy bar people. The first bite people REALLY enjoy the first bite of things, such as candy bars, or the first lick of the ice cream cone, etc. Get my drift? So these people, if given a variety of items, will typically tend to eat what they deem to be the absolute best part of their meal first, so that said item can get into their mouth and be peristalsed into their belly that much faster.  When it comes to candy bars, ice cream, it&#39;s truly f*cked up to take the first bite, or lick the cone first. To get that first forkful of pasta off their plate. Truly wrong. They won&#39;t mind if you want to eat the last bits of their goodies. Then there are the last bite people, like me. We save the best for last. Even if that means we might potentially be too full to get to the last part, we&#39;ll power through and juggernaut our way to button-popping satisfaction, to get to the oasis that is the last bite. Go ahead and try my food first. Just don&#39;t ask me if you can taste it when I only have one bite left. That is grounds for a crane kick a la Daniel san.

Because I&#39;m a last bite dude, I had to eat everything on my lunch plate until I got to the goods. So I started with the chicken satay, which comes on a short skewer, and accompanied by a tiny glass ramekin of peanut sauce. As you eat the chicken off the skewer it gets harder and harder to dip it into the sauce as you work your way down to skewer. Just fork the chicken off of there to begin, your life will then be easier. Chicken is delicious, peanut sauce yum. And rice always goes well with meaty stuff. The egg roll was pretty good for a veggie egg roll. I know some people who can&#39;t stand a vegetable egg roll. My family makes mostly veggie egg rolls, so this was right up memory lane for me. Filled with cabbage and carrot, the only thing missing from my family recipe is bean sprouts and shaved green beans. Thai Little Home uses the wonton style egg roll wrapper that gets bubbly as it fries, I love those as opposed to the paper thin wrappers that don&#39;t bubble up and tend to soak up a lot of oil. The sauce that went with the egg roll was thin and sweet. In the center of my plate was a tiny bit of cucumber salad. Just the right size to be used as a palate cleanser for my 4 course lunch special.

And then there was one left, the pad see ewe. By now I was satiated to the point of almost fullness. But the sweet and slightly pan charred aroma of noodles and beef were calling me to danger like a siren to a sailor. I dug in and never looked back. Perfectly cooked noodles and balanced flavors, not overly sweet as some see ewes I&#39;ve had in the past. The beef was cooked through, moist, and not lacking as far as amount goes. I cleaned my plate, and didn&#39;t have room for anything else. And it all went down for the low low price of $7.99.

It&#39;s probably a good thing I didn&#39;t bring anything to imbibe, because I really wouldn&#39;t have had room for it. But I will be back here, lunch or dinner. BYOB is good with all meals. If you need to fill up on $10/person incl. tip for lunch, Thai Little Home Café is your home away from home."

D. Delicious
E. Exotic
F. Fast (Holy Crap- this was lightning speed) and Family owned + operated

...alright, imma be honest: I don&#39;t feel like finding an adjective for every letter of the alphabet just to be cute so I&#39;m gonna go ahead and skip to my favorite reason (after BYOB) .


S. SPICY!!!  Finally, a Thai food venue that understands when a hot blooded woman says she wants it extra spicy, she frickin&#39; means it. And I like the type of spicy their food is... it&#39;s both hot pepper spicy and black pepper spicy. Aaand they earned extra bonus points for having that spicy stuff right on the table for additional DIY spicing. 

End Alphabet. 

Sure there are lots more reasons I love Thai Little Home Cafe but really, if I didn&#39;t have you by &#39;BYOB&#39; I probably wasn&#39;t going to win you over with &#39;C&#39; through &#39;Z&#39;, anyway.

Ordered a Pad Thai with chicken ($8.95 for dinner) and the bf ordered Basil Leaf entree with beef.
The Pad Thai was just average. To be honest, it looked lighter in color than most pad thai that I&#39;ve ordered, but I can&#39;t say that it took away from the flavor. It really seemed to be just noodles, eggs and chicken. Other places I&#39;ve gone too usually add some spice and some green onions and stuff. 

Bottom line: it satisfied my craving for Thai food, but I might try other places next time."

My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for decades since it was originally established in Chicago and still continue to make the trip out to the suburbs to eat at the new location. 

From the moment you walk in you can see the numerous newspaper and food articles that rave about the food. This place has been a big part of Chicago&#39;s Thai food community since the 70&#39;s! Way before the whole Thai food craze began and still family owned and continues to put out authentic and excellent Thai dishes. I&#39;m sure there are a bunch of the older generation folks who, if they knew what yelp was or how to use it, wouldn&#39;t hesitate to give this place 5 stars.

There is something for everyone at this place. 

1. If you are dining on a budget, all the menu items are cheap and, in my opinion, under priced for the high quality and large portions you get. (no that wasn&#39;t a typo, you seriously get more than your money&#39;s worth)

2. They offer a variety of freshly prepared and tasty Thai dishes from the classic and well known Pad-Thai to  uncommon dishes like Larb-Kai and other spicy salads. My favorites are the Red Snapper with the house special sauce and the Chicken-egg noodles.

3. If no. 1 applies to you and you enjoy alcohol, then here is another reason to go to this place, it&#39;s BYOB and located in the same strip mall as a liquor store!

lastly, service is always top notch. The wait staff is always attentive and the owners love engaging with the customers and taking time out to talk and make relationships.

Go here for either lunch, dinner or take out and you are sure to get a great dining experience!"

Price, portion size, and taste are what&#39;s wrong with the Pad Thai. It was almost $10 which is a little high for some Pad Thai. You get a small container of it which contained very little beef. The worst part of it was when I looked at it, the noodles were almost as white as the fresh cabbage they have included. I knew right then and there that it was going to be very bland and I was right. It was still bland even after using some of the soy sauce that they have included. Huge disappointment."

I was pleased to see the panang curry was light and with a great marriage of flavors not the gloopy mess that you get so many places.
Additionally I was pleased that it was immaculately clean.  Not the most update furnishings but clean wins every time.

The ambiance is nice and quiet with a beautiful clean dining area. Small and quaint the way I like. Very fast service too, everything was piping hot and served at the perfect moment. Staff was extremely nice and always there if you needed anything. 

I only gave it a 4 because the pad see ewe was not as tangy as I like. I like a little more vinegar and maybe more spice. The taste was not the same that I&#39;m used too. But still enjoyed it."

We had the Thai Calamari which was perfectly cooked and tender - so many places overcook it and it turns into a texture similar to rubber bands.

For entrees we had Pad Thai (tofu), Pad Woonsen (Squid) and Panang Curry (Vegetables/Tofu).  The Pad Thai was one of the best I have ever had - a good balance between sweet/savory.  The Pad Woonsen was also very good and again, the squid was cooked to perfection.  Unfortunately, while I liked the flavor of the Panang Curry, the consistency of the sauce fell short of expectations.  It was a both consistency - it did not adhere to the rice or the other ingredients at all which, for me, is a big negative.  I love the sauce so much and want to eat it all, not leave it in a puddle on the plate.

Another nice plus is that they are BYOB  They were very welcoming of it and brought out wine glasses and opener as soon as we sat down.

I decided to try this place because of all the positive reviews on Yelp! I was greatly disappointed. 

To be fair, I am a very tough critic when it comes to Thai food since I have traveled to Thailand so many times and tried all kind of things while I was there. 

I ordered chicken and pork satay, crab rangoon, lad na noodle and chicken fried rice. The satay could use a longer marinating time or cut the meat thinner I suppose. It was pretty tasteless. The peanut sauce was ok, I prefer my with a little kick of red curry. 

Crab rangoon was very disappointing. Barely any filling and overcooked. My kids look at it and was like &#34;is this crab rangoon or fried wonton?&#34; It was dark brown and less than a dime size stuffing.

Lad na noodle was not edible. I ended up throwing it out because it was way too salty. The sauce was also runny like soup, not like the traditional lad na gravy sauce. It also didn&#39;t fill up the to go container all the way. It looks like leftover just like someone else already said on here. Also, no vinegar with pepper to go with my lad na noodle. 

The fried rice was ok. Kids ate it but could use some vegetables in it. The 2 slices of cucumber was a joke.The fried rice was more like chinese fried rice, not thai fried rice. Also, did not fill up the container completely. No lime. Thai fried rice with no lime?

I paid almost $40 for food and probably will have to pay another $40 for the dry cleaning. I left smelling like the kitchen.The smell stick to my coat. They need to fix the hood because the smell is leaking out into the dining area.

I guess the further you are from the city, the worse thai food gets. I&#39;ll stick with my 2 favorite places in Niles and Morton Grove from now on."

I haven&#39;t found any new good thai places in a while, so I was pleased coming here. Went with family for lunch, and pretty much everything across the board was good!

pad thai- on the lighter side. they use more of a sweet chili sauce than the peanut sauce
red curry and panang curry - acceptable, but pretty heavy on the peanut sauce-- i prefer my curry sweeter with more coconut milk, and this was more thick and chunky than milky.
squid salad- a new try, and i liked it! squid cooked perfectly,
chicken satay - standard
pad see ewe- light on the veggies, but also good.

Serendipitously convenient!

I have to be honest, though, I&#39;m not sure it quite lived up to its reviews.  My brother ordered some pot stickers that he thought were dried out (my dad seemed to agree), and my mom was disappointed with her chicken panang curry, saying it was very one-note and lamented the lack of vegetables.  My dad ordered their iced coffee with condensed milk, and found it too sweet-- though I think both of my parents take the blame upon themselves for ordering things they didn&#39;t know very much about.

However, I really enjoyed my vegetables red curry entree with tofu.  It&#39;s definitely spicy, but also has quite a few vegetables in it (unlike most of their entrees!)  My brother liked his chicken satay and pork fried rice, my dad liked his pad thai, and my mom really liked the tom ka kai soup with chicken that she ordered.  Anything with meat comes with a full animal&#39;s worth, which is definitely a good thing value-wise, but doesn&#39;t do much for balanced dishes.

One other thing-- we had to flag our waiter down quite a lot, certainly more than was warranted by the mostly-empty Thursday night dining room.

So to give my Mom equal spotlight time, I have to review one of her favorite restaurants! 

I&#39;ve visited here several times--actually always with my folks. We seem to get the same waitress each time but that&#39;s not a bad thing. Service is always timely, friendly and attentive. It&#39;s a pretty space, white tablecloths give it a more formal feel but it&#39;s still really casual. 

We always get the pork satay. I was a chicken satay person but Mom knows best--she said the pork satay will have better flavor because it&#39;s will hold up better--more tender and juicy--than say white meat in chicken satay. She&#39;s totally right! The pork satay has a good flavor, very tender. Add their yummy home-made peanut sauce it just amps up the flavor! 

For noodles, we pass on the Pad Thai and opt for Pad Khee Mao--wide rice noodles, Thai basil, bell peppers and Thai peppers. You can choose your choice of beef, chicken, shrimp but we always get tofu. Wonderful basil flavor, nice spice and the tofu is cooked perfectly--firm and not mushy. 

Our other go-to dishes include the House Fried Rice--we choose shrimp. The fried rice is light and not greasy. Nice pieces of tomato, onions and green onions. Topped with a fried egg, you could totally make this a meal in itself. The deep-fried snapper, either spicy or sweet/sour, is a great dish too. Fresh fish and it holds up well to the spicy or sweet/sour sauce. The Thai Iced Coffee is always a must. Very good flavor and because it&#39;s a little sweet, it helps cool off the palate when you&#39;re enjoying all the spicy food. 

So listen to your Mom, she&#39;ll never steer you wrong!"

It&#39;s the one word I would use to describe this restaurant. 

Food was not good at all. The pad see ewe I ordered was too oily. Although, they did have good shrimp toast. But, that was probably the highlight of my meal.

I gave this place two stars instead of one, only because of their lunch special. Lunch specials are only about 7 dollars, and you get a bunch of food. You get fried rice, pad thai, chicken sate, and an egg roll - in addition to the entree you order. It was very filling - but, I don&#39;t know if I would ever fill my stomach with that food again.

Also, service was mediocre. One of the things I hate the most when eating in restaurants, is when they don&#39;t serve the food all at once. I was in a group of about 15 people, and we all got our food at different times. The curry came out first. Five minutes later, a few more dishes came out. Another five minutes later, another couple dishes. And five minutes later, the last of the dishes. So, one person got their food first, and 15 minutes later the last three people got their food. A fifteen minute difference between meals coming out is not acceptable in my opinion. 

If you do still end up going here - like I said, the shrimp toast was pretty good. Other than that, don&#39;t waste your time."

and we are INSTANT fans.

This is a lunch review but most dinners looked VERY reasonable at around $8-11.

Eight lunch $7.25 specials all served with (1) egg roll, chicken satay, Pad Thai, and fried rice (no meat, no egg, no nada-you might want to skip this). When I looked at the menu online I thought you had to PICK between, the Chicken Satay, Pad Thai and fried rice, NOPE you get all three and my plate was full (again consider skipping the nekid fried rice and maybe you&#39;ll get MORE of something else;)
I should have asked for a lime slice for the pad Thai, I missed that but otherwise it was perfectly done, and FAST which I wasn&#39;t expecting. 
I went with the Pad Khee Mao Noodles with pork and it was delicious, could have been a lot hotter for my tastes and maybe a little light on the basil. I still haven&#39;t gotten used to Jalapenos instead of the small Thai or Chinese dried reds burnt a little that you don&#39;t get here like Alt Thai. I have been quoted b4 that if they are using Jalapenos it is NOT a Thai restaurant, but I like the Thai Little Home Cafe so I guess I have just become a chili pepper snob. I took half the lunch home, minus the EXCELLENT egg roll to my less spicy lunch adventurous partner.

Really basic strip mall front, but nicely decorated, quiet and spotless inside About 1/4 mile East of Arlington Heights road on Golf. There is a TV droning quietly in one corner, but it was a far away corner. No internet.

One tea bag in a pot was $1, that&#39;s too bad but we will be back soon for dinner with something wet and red and skip the tea. BYOB! Try it."

Yes, this place is cheap, but the food is not great. I ordered the pad see ewe lunch special, and it came with lots of other food (pad thai, egg roll, chicken satay, fried rice, cucumbers). I was impressed with the amount of food they gave, but much less impressed with the actual taste. The pad thai was very dry and looked/tasted like an instant pad thai dish I had made in the microwave before. I was too full to eat my chicken satay, so I can&#39;t comment on that. Everything else was just okay. Again, yes it is cheap, but I think I&#39;d rather pay more somewhere else and get better Thai food."

Don&#39;t ignore this place just because it&#39;s in a strip mall!  Good things do indeed come in strip mall packages.  (Or something like that.  I can&#39;t remember how the saying goes, so sue me.)  The decor is cute but unremarkable, save for the GIGANTIC ALBINO LOBSTER mounted on the wall near the entrance.  Scary, but cool.

During my visit, we ordered the shrimp toast as an alternative to the usual crab rangoon we often order at other Thai and Chinese restaurants.  It was tasty and filling (perhaps a little TOO filling for two people) and accompanied by a sweet cucumber and onion salad.  My chicken pad thai was very good, and tasted even better when I reheated the leftovers the next day.  My boyfriend&#39;s beef pad kee mao was excellent and very spicy.  In general, I&#39;m not a huge fan of super-spicy food, but I hate when pad kee mao isn&#39;t spicy at all!  I really enjoyed Thai Little Home&#39;s version.

No, this suburban strip mall restaurant isn&#39;t a stylish place to &#34;see and be seen,&#34; but it does provide good Thai food for affordable prices - and the opportunity to see an enormous dead lobster, to boot!  How many restaurants can promise THAT?"

Thai Little Home has a lot of items on their menu. Some are pretty good, some are not so good. Everything I got was a bit too oily for my taste. But the seasoning is typically right on. I would definitely come back to try out more items on their menu. 

The thai egg rolls - good, but standard 
The pork satay - plump and flavorful. the cucumber salad was too sweet and the peanut sauce started to separate and looked kind of gross. 
wonton soup - DO NOT get this! Not even sure what the filling is made of.
fried rice- solid, good seasoning, not too salty, pretty standard."

Came here with some co-workers.  Had a lunch special choice (pad see ew).  It was typical, but I came back with my wife on a separate occasion and that was a lot better.

We ordered the papaya salad, which my wife loves.  Also ordered a whole fish that was prepared with a variety of veggies.  That was excellent.  

We also had lettuce wraps that is usually ground chicken.  Only, upon inspection, it wasn&#39;t ground chicken, it was actually great quality (white meat) chicken that was broken and torn to bits.  That totally won me over as it was fresh, flavorful and good quality.

We ordered the fresh spring rolls while we waited for our takeout order. Two really long spring rolls were delivered to our table within a couple minutes. They were cut into bite sized pieces like a sushi roll and the syrupy sauce was poured on top. The first bite was surprisingly and uncharacteristically warm, nay, hot! So I recalibrated my expectations for a hot appetizer assuming they had just made it without time to chill. The sauce was sweet, the soft wrap was good but the stuff inside was not. Plain tofu, plain scrambled eggs and plain noodles. No flavor and very spongey. I was starving so I kept eating anyway. After 2 more bites down the line, the roll was lukewarm and then refrigeratedly cold, revealing that the roll must have been microwaved for some reason and very unevenly at that. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it had been in the freezer. Yuck. We left about half of it on the table. Our takeout order included the potstickers, vegetable red curry with tofu and the Pad Khee Mao with chicken. I liked that the potstickers were made with chicken instead of pork. They were served with a &#34;spicy vinegar-soy sauce&#34; which was not spicy and very vinegary. The red curry was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. The sauce was watery thin and painfully lacking that yummy rich curry flavor and not a single leaf of Thai basil to be found. The Pad Khee Mao noodles were very mushy and the prominent ingredient in this dish was oil. No real tasty flavor to speak of. The &#34;hot peppers&#34; appeared to be jalapeños which I always detest when they&#39;re standing in for Thai chilies; but alas, this seems to be the norm in Chicago. (I&#39;m partial to the Thai food in Orlando). At least it was nice to see Thai basil in this dish and the chicken was cooked well. Even though I was not impressed I will mention that my husband said he liked the noodles."

This is the quintessential traditional polish deli. 90% meat, everything is probably very fresh and authentic, and they even have super inexpensive lunch sandwiches (hint: order 2 for lunch). However, this isn&#39;t all that different than basically making sandwiches at home.

At the same time, you have just about every polish product you&#39;d see at a fresh market or a garden fresh or equivalent grocery store - just all boiled down to polish products. It&#39;s not like they hide this information - it&#39;s as explicit as it can get from the outside.  In short, if you want polish products? You should probably live here.  5 stars from a polish perspective.
If you want a vegetarian lunch? You are in the wrong place. 0 stars for veggies.

Also, there is nowhere to sit. This is a deli/grocery store, and clearly not a restaurant. The staff are pretty nice, and the star is the deli itself (not the lunch sandwiches, it seems)."

The customer service is questionable at best and that&#39;s what keeps it from being a 5 star+++. I expect a language barrier at an ethnocentric deli but the complete lack of effort to try to speak English (or broken English) as I try to speak broken Polish (and I am 3rd generation Polish), is a joke. I get the fact that I should be a bit more fluent but c&#39;mon, I am the one spending the cash and I try my best without being fluent but the folks on the other side of the counter should show just a bit more patience with a bit more effort as I try my best to speak the language. This is my first choice when buying holiday meals but when I am tired and trying to put all the party shopping together, I need folks who are willing to give me a little lee-way when I am trying to give my Family an Old school Polish meal without having to feel guilty for my lack of fluency. My solution to this has been being just as rude and impatient as the folks serving me. All that being said, Helen&#39;s is a great place to put together a Polish Family meal with very fair pricing.

Helens is very small but has an incredible amount of items in that tiny store. the deli meat cooler runs the length of the store and from what my wife tells me the prices are far better than Jewel on fresh cut meats and cheese. you are at a major disadvantage if you don&#39;t speak Polish but don&#39;t sweat it you&#39;ll be fine.

Tried their potato salad, potato pancakes, potato and cheese pierogi, and cabbage rolls!! Yum! I heard going on the weekend (Friday or Saturday) there was more variety and there sure is!! Fresh cooked smoked butt or bacon, meat or sauerkraut filled polish egg rolls, cooked chicken with some kinds of cheese, cheese blintzes, apple pancakes and a LARGE variety of cakes!! So delicious!!! Will be back for more!!!!! A must try family owned deli!!!"

This place is way cool.. they sell Polish shampoo.. .and Polish spreadable cheese.. Polish magazines, Polish uhmm... rye bread.

The things I&#39;d come here for tho.. are the ham, sausages and meats. They looked so darn enticing and surely most of them are home made. I&#39;ve been told (and now I have seen) Helen&#39;s has one of the better selections of &#34;salceson&#34;?, Polish head cheese, in the city. I like pork in every form....

PLUS -  Great POLISH deli in the area - otherwise you have to go up to Mt. Prospect or out to Bartlett (the famous AJ&#39;s on Rt. 59 that used to be on Irving Pk in Wood Dale) so 5 stars.

MINUS - LOTS of good ol &#34;regular&#34; delis scattered about - Helen&#39;s is average 3 stars for limited &#34;regular&#34; variety. 

PLUS - Lots of great Polish meats.  5 stars

MINUS - Their pierogi dough is dry and floury but the fillings are good with many choices. Try frying in lots of butter after boiling.  2 stars

PLUS - Amazing selection of Polish canned/jarred/packaged foods.   5 stars

MINUS - Jampacked tiny store only allows one patron to pass at a time....literally.  1 star

You will really wonder how the 75 shoppers are able to fit into the 7 cars parked in the 5 parking spaces.  So, skip Saturdays and go during the week before rush hour for yummy treats."

Had a great experience last time but this time it was just terrible.

We ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer since they had their half off apps happy hour special. The mozzarella sticks were over fried. It didn&#39;t taste that great and the marinara sauce wasn&#39;t good. The sauce almost made my sticks soggy with how much liquid there was in it. It wasn&#39;t a creamy and smooth sauce. 

We ordered a 10&#34; deep dish with pepperoni and sausage. What we got looked like to be a regular pizza with peppers and sausage. I was so disappointed with how it came out. I was expecting the deep dish to be be deep dished filled with lots and lots of cheese. They might&#39;ve used deep dish to make it but it had the amount of cheese as a regular pizza would have. I definitely don&#39;t recommend their deep dish ever. It is a good regular pizza though. 

The service was good. The server came often to check on us and filled up our water. Getting pitchers of beer was really slow though which didn&#39;t make sense because I saw the bartenders in front me just standing there chit chatting"

Back in the summer we got a pizza and a few beers and we&#39;re hit with like 6.50 in tax! On a Sunday football game this is 2 beers! We don&#39;t go there much so, today we had 1/2 priced pizza and a few beers but, they charged us tax on everything. No other restaurant we go to does this! Very unfair!

Service during busy evening hrs was awful (took forever for our waiter to come over, then forever in between each interaction and food/drink delivery.)

I want to say the place is short staffed and huge, the size making things worse. The waiters are either around one of the cash registers (maybe training??) or nowhere to be seen. When they do emerge (you have to pay attention), catching their attention is tough, they seem to either have other things to do or too focused on, well not you. 
I don&#39;t think the waiters are bad, rather the management. 

It&#39;s tiring. Also it has happened 4 times now, all around lunch hour. 
The food is pretty good, and that&#39;s coming from a non-chain- and a non-sports-guy. I&#39;ll try the Schaumburg location again next, a little further but not horrible. I think they have better service.

The parking lot or should I say super remote not well lit cross a creek parking to get to the main lot was creepy. But the parking was free.

The party room was downstairs. The downstairs has a Grandma&#39;s basement vibe with the old tile floor and wood paneling and dim lighting.

As a restaurant, i feel a lot of the entrees are overpriced. Maybe that&#39;s just &#34;sticker shock&#34; from when this place was &#34;famous freddie&#39;s&#34; years ago, and had amazing dinner deals for bachelors such as myself...

The MAIN reason why it doesn&#39;t get 5 stars is because you can&#39;t get a pizza after 9:20 at night. What the hell is that? It&#39;s not like we&#39;re living in some hick town, and you&#39;ve got ma and pa cranking out the pizzas, and they need to close the kitchen down so they can get up with the chickens....

There are plenty of people who want late nite pizza. If they just kept the kitchen open for pizza deliveries alone, i think they would do quite well.  Thank God  i&#39;m not into 420 or some such thing, or i would really be mad at them. As such, i&#39;m just KINDA upset for their non-partier&#39;s schedule when it comes to pizza. C&#39;mon boys...you&#39;re in a MAJOR market here...deliver pizzas later, PLEASE...! At least until 10:30....!!!!!  At 9:20, i&#39;m just getting started, sometimes...."

30 minutes later I call the store again...this time I speak to two people on where is my order and they claim I don&#39;t have one.  They even begin debating me on how I called the wrong store.  I shared I hit &#34;redial&#34; and asked why were they telling me my pizza is on the way if I didn&#39;t have an order there.

Needless to say... a manager got on the line and basically began debating me as well.  Clearly... they are not looking for business.  I clearly agree with the writer who said the staff is retarded.

My husband and I often order pizza.  We like a very crispy crust, so we normally tell them to make it well done.  The past couple times we ordered the pizza and had it delivered, we didn&#39;t tell them well done, but the pizza itself just wasn&#39;t very hot, and it looked like the mushrooms were barely cooked.  We almost always order fries with our meal, and they were always nice and crispy when we got them, but the past few times we ordered they were just so-so, not really hot and mushy.  Last week the fries were completely undercooked and so soggy and limp I couldn&#39;t eat half of them.  I wouldn&#39;t complain had the food always been like this, but it seems like the food - at least what is delivered - is a lot less fresh than it used to be.  We live across the street, so there shouldn&#39;t be a reason why it&#39;s not hot and at least moderately crispy.

We sat down at a table in the bar area in front of the projector screen and waited 15 minutes before a server came over to our table--which was a real quick &#34;I&#39;ll be right with you.&#34; After which we waited another 10 minutes.  A trainee came over and took our drink order and a few minutes later brought our drinks but couldn&#39;t take any food orders which was fine because we were waiting on one other person.  A minute later our server came over and asked what we wanted to order to which we told her the same thing and she just walked away without saying anything.  We finished our first pitcher of beer and ordered another from the trainee because our waitress still had not come back. Once our third person came our waitress asked if she wanted a glass to have beer to which she replied yes--the waitress came back and threw it down on our table and walked away.  During the first intermission of the hockey game we ordered food from our waitress; I ordered the Jack Daniels&#39; burger medium, my brother the Jack Daniels&#39; burger well done, and his gf the gluten free lemon herb chicken with mashed potatoes.  Our burgers came out and they looked exactly the same--neither one was what we asked for, and his gf&#39;s mashed potatoes were so garlicky they were inedible. Our waitress never came back to our table to ask if everything came out okay.  The next time anyone came to our table was after we had stacked our plates on the edge of the table in hopes that someone would notice that we were finished with our meal.  A guy came by and took our plates and then our waitress came by and without ever actually stopping at our table asked if we wanted dessert--which there&#39;s no way should could have heard our answer since she was already 10 feet away.  At this point the second period of the hockey game was not even over yet--which decked out in our Blackhawks gear it was pretty clear we were there to watch the game--but the waitress dropped off a bill at our table without saying anything and walked away.  About 10 minutes later she came back and asked if it was all set and we let her know that we actually would prefer another pitcher of beer.  Again, about 15-20 minutes before the game was over she dropped off another bill and walked away. I happened to have a $10 off coupon that I wanted to apply and we waited 15 minutes for her to come back before I went up to the bar and asked the bartender to adjust our bill since I could not find her at all.  Once she brought it back again we noticed that she charged us for a pitcher of something other than what we had ordered and that was more expensive--which was another hassle to get changed. My brother had to walk around the restaurant looking for her.  

We watched our server interact with other tables fine--they were bigger parties and probably spent more money than we did--but I live 2 minutes away from Moretti&#39;s and dine there often and was incredibly disappointed in the way we were treated.  We weren&#39;t in a hurry and would not have minded waiting for quality service, however, the entire time we were there we felt like we were an inconvenience to our server and that she was trying to rush us out of the restaurant. It was a very disappointing experience and I will take my business elsewhere when I want to enjoy a meal and watch a game."

Hearing that this was the same Moretti&#39;s from Chicago that I heard about, I suggested ordering pizza for here.  I should preface this by my review is only about take-out.  

The pizza was good. We ordered the thin crust cheese and also one with cheese, onion, and tomatoes.  Everyone, including our picky eater, was pleased.  I liked that it was thin, but soft and not too crispy.  What knocks it down a star was that it wasn&#39;t all that hot. It wasn&#39;t a long delivery trip and yet it was just lukewarm when we got it. It didn&#39;t taste as fresh and hence no raving review.  I am assuming my gripes with this may be solved by actually eating at the restaurant. 

I&#39;d go there and check it out again, but I&#39;d be less excited about getting the pizza to go."

For months, one of my good friends raved about how great the food/deals were at Moretti&#39;s. 1/2 off pizzas on Tuesdays= $6 pizza/2 people= $3 pizzas?Why not. So I went for the first time to the Mount Prospect location, and I was expecting a lot. 

We ordered a pan spinach pizza. Meh. I&#39;ve had a lot better elsewhere. I also ordered a pina colada and was disappointed with the result. The bartender made something that tasted like a watered down margarita with lime. This was definitely NOT a pina colada, so I sent it back. They finally brought back something that tasted like pineapple/coconut, but still very watered down. Grrr..

To be fair, I&#39;ll give Moretti&#39;s another shot. I&#39;ve been wanting to try the Edison Park location, since I frequent Snuggery. I hope it fairs better."

Where they fail is the service. It&#39;s almost laughable how bad it is. No welcoming smile or even a hello from the hostess stand. Waitresses are all standing around chit chatting rather than checking on tables or clearing dirty dishes. We had to find our own plates and silverware from other tables. And of course no thank you or goodnight from hostess stand when we left. 

Bad customer service but great food seems to be the common theme among reviews. Shame on the management for not keeping the front of the house in order.

Our office orders from here regularly and we have come to eat in the restaurant multiple times. I&#39;m starting to think it&#39;s out of convenience, but this should not be the reason to eat somewhere and continue to eat somewhere repeatedly. 

They are a good place for after work drinks and apps and their patio is nice in the warmer months. They have bags and a fire pit.

We ordered out from here a week and a half ago. There were two of us who ordered their Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club. They were AWESOME!! There was this basil-butter (almost pesto-like) stuff that really added a freshness to the sandwich. There was also 2 gorgeous strips of bacon and a nice piece of mozzarella cheese (which I has substituted for the provolone they normally put on this sandwich). Everything we get from Moretti&#39;s is messy and typically pretty decent. For $20, two of us can have a decent lunch. 

There are two of us that work together who eat lunch out about once a week. He buys one week and I buy the next week. Last Friday, it was my turn and I suggested the same meal we had the previous Friday because that pesto butter was sooooo good and we both were kinda drooling looking forward to lunch out on Friday. We ordered about 12 noon for pick up at 1:20 pm. I went to pick up. Waited for about 10 minutes for the young lady who helped me and after all the waiting, she found our food was in the hot box by the hostess station minus one item we ordered, so I had to wait even longer. When I was back at the office and started to eat it was like the food was sitting there since we had placed our order at noon. The fries were cold and chewy- ICK! and the sandwich was nothing like last week&#39;s. It was like it came from another restaurant. Limp bacon, hardly any cheese and that lovely pesto/basil butter stuff was no where to be found :(

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back but not in a big hurry to return unfortunately."

2 guests for lunch 1:30pm

The other day I was at Moretti&#39;s Mount Prospect with my 80 year old grandmother and the service by Leslie was absolutely terrible.

Leslie, our server, was rude when seating us (no host during lunch).  She didn&#39;t say ONE word to us...she just wiped the table off while we stood there and then dropped the menu&#39;s and walked away.  Not a huge deal but that was just the beginning of what was to be an awful experience.  

I&#39;m not sure what is expected of the servers by Moretti&#39;s management but In my experience the server would welcome you with a smile, tell you their name and if they were going to leave right away would at least tell you they will be with you in a minute.

We ordered two apps, the stuffed mushrooms and the onion rings.  20 minutes later we still hadn&#39;t received our appetizers and I saw Leslie chatting with co workers and drinking Iced Tea at the bar.  I knew from working in a restaurant that apps usually take between 5-15 minutes on a busy day, but it was dead.  By the time Leslie decided to go into the kitchen to check our food her other table had already closed out and left.   

When our apps finally did come out the mushrooms were cold and the onion rings were cold, tough and chewy.  Leslie didn&#39;t know this because she disappeared after dropping them off at our table.  After several minutes of looking around for anyone who worked there I eventually stopped a guy who was walking by our table, I asked him to tell our server that we would like to see her.  He was nice enough to ask what he could do and we told him about the toughness of the onion rings.  He came back shortly after taking our onion rings to the back and apologized for the inconvenience and said that he tried them and they were not like they should be and a new order will be out. 

Leslie did appear shortly after that but didn&#39;t even come by our table.  She went directly behind the bar.  I&#39;m assuming that she was closing lunch and she was responsible for the bar and the dining room.  That being said; there were only two or three people at the bar and no other tables in the dining room.  Why didn&#39;t she come over and ask how we were doing???  

13 minutes later (yes, I timed it) Leslie decided to go in the kitchen to check our food and of course the rings were ready, and probably sitting there for some time as well.  When she drops them off at the table she says &#34;I had the cook make an extra onion ring for me and I tried it, it&#39;s the way it should be now...&#34;

We ordered a 12&#34; pizza to split.  We decided to go all out getting a Tuscan vegetarian and the Asiago stuffed crust since we saw a sign as we came in that said 1/2 price pizza on Tuesdays.  When we received the bill I was shocked to see that our pizza was not 1/2 price and when I went to the bar to talk to Leslie about the charges she informed me that it only applies to after 4pm.  

Upon leaving I checked the sign again and in black marker there is a hand written note that states after 4pm but I still felt duped....The size of the hand written note is much smaller than the other writing and it blends into the background of the sign.  Seriously who the hell approved this?? 

We were both completely appalled/disapointed by the experience and I&#39;m going to tell everyone I know about this.  Plus with a Rosati&#39;s right across the street I know where I&#39;m going next time for pizza."

Prospect locations. However, our last visit to the Mt. Prospect Moretti&#39;s was sadly disappointing. 

It was a weeknight around 5:30 PM when we arrived and despite standing at the hostess station for at least three minutes, no one ventured up to greet us. After going to the bar and requesting to be seated, the bartender was able to flag down a passing waiter who ended up being our server. A nice guy, I don&#39;t remember his name, but he was pleasant enough. After getting our drinks for us, we ordered our food. The deep fried coconut onion rings were spectacular, but my wife&#39;s pasta entree arrived without the chicken it was supposed to have. Odd, since it was one of their signature dishes. I waited patiently while the kitchen fixed up her plate, but it wasn&#39;t too long. We had to ask for bread with our meal, something that should have automatically been offered up along with the water we had to ask for as well.

Onto dinner. Everything is tasty, and the special I ordered is quite good. And that&#39;s the problem with Moretti&#39;s. The food is always good, but the weak service and little things that get overlooked tend to distract from the overall dining experience.

Then i called to complain about the wings, and hostess Nadia&#39;s exact statement were, &#34;i&#39;m sorry about that, not sure what i can do now&#34; Instead of suggesting a solution, it was more of can I get off the phone now? So I realize she&#39;s not a decision maker, nor is she credible enough to make that decision, I requested to speak with the manager Charlie.  Who was nice enough to give me a credit of 25.00 from my 61.00 order.  I thought, okay they&#39;re redeeming themselves, but when I checked on my bank account this morning I see not one 61.00 charge but 2 charges of 61.00 + instead of giving me a credit they charged my account 34! So do the math, I was charged 156 total!!! All the 5 stars may have been just the food, because I admit they were good.  But the people, well, not sure how they can redeem themselves with this...but i am planning on contacting they&#39;re bosses bosses, because taking my money so fast within seconds is not right, and returning it after 72 hours makes it wrong."

When it arrived an hour later it was lukewarm and over cooked. The cheese was very thin and brown. The crust was dark brown. There was only a scant amount of sauce.

I have to say that the store contacted me today with an apology and offer to make it right. You can&#39;t ask for more than that. They may have had a bad night."

When we first walked in, we waited for about 5 minutes before we were acknowledged by the staff. The person who finally seated us offered a table at the back of the restaurant when most people were being seated at the front so we asked to be seated at a booth in the front instead. The booth had no condiments or lunch offering signage so I took the initiative to take it from the booth behind us. It took about another five minutes before our server decided to make an appearance and ask us if we&#39;d like drinks. We advised her that yes, we would like drinks and that we are also ready to order. We ordered the baked Rigatoni and when the server brought it to us, we were appalled by the small portion and bare meal. The server noticed the expression on our faces and asked if we needed anything else so we asked &#34;Does bread come with this?&#34; She said &#34;sure&#34; and brought a loaf of bread. I did notice that other tables were being readily served with loafs of bread. So, I tried to rationalize with supervisor suggesting that this small portion of pasta and bare meal may be a lunch portion for $7. Well, our meal turned out to be $16 each and to be courteous, we left a 20% gratuity. Paying $20 each for a small portion pasta dish with unsatisfactory service left a really bad first impression. It is highly unlikely that we will ever return to this restaurant. Moreover, we will advise our fellow associates, family and friends against them making the same mistake."

I could kick myself for falling for the ads/restaurant pictures, but being relatively new to the area, who knew? 

I was expecting a &#34;nicer&#34; restaurant. If you are looking for a fun place to watch &#34;the game,&#34; or a casual night out, then you would be in luck! Otherwise, keep the prom dress at home!

We were seated in a booth underneath a HUGE screen that I could have sworn, said &#34;Property of AMC Theaters&#34; on the back, as it was immense. I like the Cubs, but not when they are overlooking my salad and bread sticks! We asked to be moved, and all got alittle better...until... the waitress was asked about their wine list, and the response was a very limp, &#34;this is my first night,&#34; with no effort to find someone to help her with the question. 

Fast forward.. the menu was ok. I split a 12 &#39;&#39; pizza with a family member (good enough for 2 people, pushing it for 3 people). Another family member had spaghetti/sausage. 

The service from the other staff members was good (our waitress&#39;s trainer came over to check on us).

The atmosphere was lively for a Friday night. Again, a fun place for a casual evening. TV&#34;s were all over the place, and there was ample parking."

On this most recent trip to their Mt Prospect location I grabbed a late night meal with my buddy, who&#39;s a pasta fiend. That night they had  1/2 off pizzas, hungry from a long night of work we got Buffalo wings, the Italian trio (which includes Lasagna, Chicken Parmesan and Linguine Alfredo) and a Tuscan Veg pizza. Good thing I had Oogie S. with me, he can pack food away easily. The wings could&#39;ve used more buffalo sauce, a few drops drizzled over wings which were prepared quite nicely. The Italian trio was tasty and a great deal of food which could easily be shared by two as a meal. I was told that the Tuscan vegetarian pizza had a spicy flavor to it, which to me didn&#39;t, maybe to others. It was a good vegetarian option and the vine-ripe tomatoes were flavorful which complimented the pie. Business was dismal at that time of night so service was nearby.

So then I made eye contact with another waitress and she politely came over and seated us.  I explained what just happened and she apologized.  We were seated and then approached by the woman who ignored us initially to take our order.  GREAT..... so it goes. We order.  He got the turkey club avocado and I got the Italian Cobb salad.  We also got the onion rings.  Food was good...server...not so much.    She walked by us twice after getting our food and didn&#39;t even acknowledge or ask us how our food was until the 3rd time by.

As someone who has worked in service, I understand that things happen and when the place gets busy, the staff can&#39;t always be completely on top of it, but our server failed to recognize that my friend and I had joined up with the other 5 people already sitting there for about 10 minutes.  I let it slide, as it was busy.  But when she forgot to bring our beers, I was disappointed.  She apologized and said she would get a round and took our order.  When our pizza came, I saw out of the corner of my eye some movement - which turned out to be a mouse.  My friend jumped up on her chair, which caught our server&#39;s attention.  She came over and I let her know that the mouse had gone back toward the kitchen.  She looked far too nonplussed but still brought a manager over.  I&#39;m not sure if it was because we were all still in our bartending garb, but he actually made a joke about &#39;guessing it&#39;s time to call an exterminator&#39;.  Not really funny, dude.  When the bill came, the manager didn&#39;t comp a thing, even the drinks our server had said she would.  So much for at least trying to keep us happy."

The pizza by the slice is still around, and it&#39;s still fantastic. I&#39;ve since moved to Dallas, where pizza isn&#39;t anywhere near the caliber of Chicago, and upon returning to visit, I stopped in to say hello. I bought two slices to go and they remembered me!

They have excellent pasta and salads (their antipasto salad is still one of my all-time favorites) too. My family likes the baked ziti and I love the mostaccioli. I think it&#39;s the sauce that does it for me here. Other places just don&#39;t have it. Super friendly, fast delivery, and excellent food.

I saw that someone commented about the sauce at being &#34;bland&#34; and I have to disagree. I was actually a little surprised at how good I thought it was. It&#39;s not your typical pizza sauce, to be sure. It has almost more of a pasta sauce taste, but I really liked it. Their crust is thin and perfectly crisp. And the other thing I liked a lot was that I could taste traces of basil in the pizza (maybe in the sauce?) The sausage and mushrooms were lovely and more flavorful than I&#39;ve had anywhere else. 

As far as thin crust goes, this place has definitely jumped to the top of my list. It actually might be the best thin crust I&#39;ve ever had. Can&#39;t wait to try some of their specialty pizzas."

Their pizza has an almost perfect thin crust that&#39;s not too doughy but doesn&#39;t taste like cardboard either. They&#39;ve got great sauce that is at a perfect ratio to the cheese and toppings. It&#39;s just greasy enough without being too greasy where you have to soak it up with a napkin. I&#39;ve never had a bad pizza from here. The delivery is super-fast and the pizza is nice and hot, which is always a plus in my book.

If you like spinach on your pizza, you&#39;ll love theirs. Yes, another double ingredient charge, but this time it is understandable and totally worth it (I am not an unreasonable woman). You see, it has somehow been sauted or otherwise infused with garlic. So as much as I resent certain excessive-cheese-charges, they will always have me at garlicky spinach. Just amazing."

I have definitely found the best thin crust and I would imagine that their other pizzas are just as fantastic.  Crust was perfect and sauce had just the right amount of spice and flavor.

Bonus: On Sundays, their food special is $10 cheese pizzas! I also ended up getting the nachos later on, which were FULLY loaded and only $10. Definitely a great value.

I really wanted to like it but everyone in my group hated the experience. I was under the impression it was a sports bar. Sports memorabilia everywhere, huge flat screen TVs, pool tables and everything else yet on football Sundays they don&#39;t play the sound on the football games. Instead, I had to listen to Justin Bieber playing on the Jukebox. Makes sense. 

On to the food...
I had a group of 5 and we ordered appetizers and a pizza. Our appetizers came out fairly quickly and were tasty. Our pizza literally took an hour and a half to come out. After 40 minutes we flagged down the waitress and asked her about the pizza. She said oh yeah, your sausage pizza I&#39;ll check on that. We said no, the pepperoni we ordered. She said oh yeah, that&#39;s what I meant. Never a sorry or anything. 40 minutes after that it came out and looked like a frozen tombstone pizza. We all sat there and looked at it like seriously, this is what we waited an hour and a half for? 

On to the beer...
When we got to the bar we all sat down at a table and ordered a table tapper. After 15 minutes of not seeing the waitress again we finally saw her and asked her where our beer was. She said oh yeah, they&#39;re changing the keg. 15 minutes later we finally got it. Apparently takes that long for them to change a keg. 

This place just sucks. Service is horrible, food is bad. We were a table of 5. 4 of whom are in the restaurant industry and are usually forgiving with some things but this was just bad.

To top it off, waitress did not apologize one time about the 30 minute wait for beer or hour and a half wait for frozen pizza. 

Take your business elsewhere."

I made the mistake of thinking because they had a $10 large pizza offer from 10pm to 12am the kitchen would be open.  The 160 TV&#39;s is crazy but not really a big deal.  As it&#39;s a really large area. (bar, video poker room, 2 patios, OTB area with another bar and the large pool and dining area.) Some of those TV&#39;s are dedicated to the OTB (off track betting) part of this place. 

I take it on game nights and weekends this place is packed but wasn&#39;t so when I got in. So slow my waiter was playing darts with a few co workers in the inside patio behind the main bar.

Lots of option for drafts/bottles and wine. Pizza was okay. I was asked did I want thin crust pizza but didn&#39;t taste thin at all. Pizza wasn&#39;t the &#34;worst&#34; but I wouldn&#39;t order it again. The bar food is what I was looking to try out. Speaking to my waiter she mentioned the panini sandwich&#39;s is usually what she eats the most here but do enjoy the wings as well. 

From a guy prospective it really is a nice chil and hang out spot to come to and will visit again just hope the bar food items are much better than the pizza I had."

There were two birthday parties going on as well, that took up most of the area, and no one appeared to be watching any of that,  The  one &#34;manager&#34; did turn on one large screen and two much smaller screens that were a minimum of 15 feet away.

Our usual bar that we go to didn&#39;t have any free table for the Blackhawks game, so we came here instead. We were seated right away (it&#39;s a big place with plenty of seats), and immediately noticed how many beers they had and a wide food selection. They had a $3 special for any of the beer drafts, which is in same cases a steal for a bar. The service was pretty decent all night, it was very busy so not perfect, but understandable. They have a lot of TVs and big screens throughout the whole bar, so you can see a game from pretty much any angle. 

As far as food goes, we ordered the pretzel bites, which were good. I eventually ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was good, I wish there was a little more sauce, but still a good sandwich. The only other complaint I have is the cushions in the booths are not very comfortable - you sink into the seat way too much. Both my friend and I agreed, so we switched to a table which was better.

The manager talked to us about 3 times and made sure everything went well and that we were happy. I saw him making rounds throughout the night. That was impressive to me, you don&#39;t see that everywhere."

We finally got our drinks and the server give us the check at the same time. SO RUDE.. you would think we would order more drinks?? So we ask for the manager.. we get a guy stating he is the owner.. Ops so we explain that this is our first visit and the rude service we got. All he said is ill take care of the drinks. Really?? What about the poor service?  We left our drinks and walked out.

She went over all the specials and told us that we had about 20 minutes to order something for Happy Hour. She even let us try some samples of beer before ordering them. Her service was very good, very friendly, attentive and just over all made the experience what is was. Very good!
I ordered the Thursday Burger special for $6, burgers came on a pretzel bun, and I didn&#39;t want the fries, so I was able to substitute a side salad, and that was filling in itself.

We ordered the nachos app to start, which was loaded with meat, cheese, beans, and had sour cream/guac on the side. The chips were super fried and had a little bit of a donut aftertaste due to the frying, so I didn&#39;t like those as much. The flavor of the toppings was awesome though, with quality ingredients.

I took half home and could not wait to eat the rest the next morning! (You should really try dinner for breakfast, it&#39;ll change your life!)

I would not hesitate to return for a game, a date... anything!"

We stopped by last night to meet up some friends I was really impressed with the setting. I have been there for lunch but the night time crowd is definitely a fun place to be. If your planning on watching a game or a fight they have tvs all over so you will not miss out on any of the action.  I also like the fact that they had a dj there playing  some of my favorite old school songs.

They have a game room with slot machine access at any time and people actually rotate so you really are not standing around waiting for a machine to open up. 

I really like the the crowd they have there it&#39;s a fun atmosphere with a large banquet  area I seen when I got lost going go the bathroom,which I have to say they keep really clean being a guys kind of place.  

The food selection is perfect  for that venue. Parking is all over this us definitely a place to chill out with friends or family.  I&#39;m for sure going to be returning top this venue."

You guys have a great selection of beer and the food is very good. You have an entire room dedicated to slots and an entire room for horse gambling and an entire room for private parties. The main area is all voluted ceilings with brand new arcade games, pool table and darts! This is what I call an any age bar. Unfortunately your dominant customers are the bikers and the gamblers but I&#39;m sure in time the crowd will diversify, I hope lol. One thing I don&#39;t like though is you only have female bartenders. The new hire is also female but at least she&#39;s not caucasian. Firm believer in diversity, especially when I&#39;m at the bar. Ps upon going my second time aka last week, the bartender remembered my name. Props!

Food-wise I would recommend the Crazy Pour Burger. We&#39;re talking crispy slices of bacon stacked on an over-medium fried egg a-top of a thick juicy patty prepped to your liking. By the time you finish this monster (along-side with the fries that accompany it) you feel like you&#39;ve been feasting for days. My girl says the hot-wings are phenomenal, and if you&#39;re in the sharing mood...order the giant pretzel..its obnoxiously big.

Drinks are great. The Hard Rootbeer is my personal fav. But if you&#39;re a snob for craft beers, then you&#39;ve probably died and gone to heaven coming here. Drinks and food are reasonably priced. 

Atmosphere is clean, staff is friendly and the crowd seems pretty mixed in terms of age &amp; race, so you get a pretty good social variety here. They have a Live DJ on the weekends and a gaming room with slot machines for those individuals who like to dance with lady luck. Overall, a great place that won&#39;t disappoint.

I was reading the Daily Herald and saw that one of their writers did a write-up on Crazy Pour, which is what first alerted me to this place even existing. Apparently it opened in September, but seeing as there isn&#39;t much on North Ave, I never saw it. Actually, you might miss it as you drive down North Ave. It&#39;s right next door to AutoZone, FYI.

My bf and I were looking for a place to watch the NFL conference finals and decided to check this place out. If you&#39;re looking for a Blackhawks bar, this would definitely be the place to be. We walked in just as the Hawks scored a goal, and off goes the foghorn, which scared the crap out of me. It&#39;s super loud, but I guess that means they do a good job of making you feel like you&#39;re at the game without having to sell your soul for tickets. There are tons of TVs and projection screens. Everywhere you turn, you&#39;ll catch the game. THey also have a sports ticker behind the bar, which is cool. No more squinting to see the bottom line on ESPN!

This isn&#39;t just a hole in the wall sports bar, though. It&#39;s pretty nice on the inside, though I could do without the pick-up lines WordArt in the bathroom (&#34;Was it love at first sight or should I walk by again.&#34; Really?). They don&#39;t have a ton in terms of food. They have pizzas which looked pretty good judging by the people we saw who ordered it, and the burgers sounded good too. We both went for a panini and ordered some beer. They need to update that beer list, though, because every time we asked for a beer, they didn&#39;t have it. We had to keep looking back at the tap handles to figure out what to get.

Our food took a while to get to us, which was surprising considering there weren&#39;t many people there. I didn&#39;t mind too much since we were watching the game and having a beer, but I was hungry, so it was a bit noticeable. I wasn&#39;t too impressed with the food. They really shouldn&#39;t call it a panini. It was more of a hot sandwich. I&#39;m not a sandwich snob by any means, but I do frequent Panera and I watch a lot of Chopped, so I know what the frick a panini is and this was not it. It was grilled cheese with bacon. And in fact, I could probably make a better one at home. The fries were meh. I would prefer fresh cut. 

Food aside, the atmosphere here is cool and great for a game. They also have off track betting and a video gambling room off to the side. I&#39;ll probably be back when I&#39;m in the mood to watch a game, but I&#39;ll definitely be trying something other than the &#34;panini&#34; and I hope they update their beer list by then."

I can&#39;t comment on the venue during game time, but every time I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve never been disappointed.  The nachos are great, but my fav has to be the stuffed clams...so much flavor, and ask for extra bread to sop up the deeeelicious sauce!

I don&#39;t expect joints like this to have more than avg food but everything i&#39;ve tried so far had been good and beaten my expectations.

There is a cute outdoor area which a fireplace which they turned on (It&#39;s gas) just for my chilled self. The waitress was nice, but kind of clueless when it came to drinks. She did not know what some drinks were (&#34;straight up&#34; confused her) and liquors stumped her as well (Campari, ftw) Basically, this is not a place to experiment with new drinks. Stick to your old favorites and you&#39;ll be fine.

One the menu for us that night was: 
-Southwest Eggrolls - I&#39;m addicted to these. Anywhere I can order them, I do, and they always make me want another dozen orders of them #hungrygirlproblems
-Baked Clams- Our waitress forgot we ordered these, I think. They took more than a half hour to arrive! I wasn&#39;t impressed, as the &#34;baked&#34; portion covered the clams themselves, but the topping was soggy as a car wash sponge. Pass!
-WINGS. yum. serious. Get these. The hot sauce was perfect, not too painful but still acceptable for the fire-breathing dragon I was with. 

Good place for appetizers, people watching, and wings. I&#39;d head back if I was in need of a buffalo fix."

As an official Blackhawks bar, the siren thing is LOUD so be ye warned and cover your ears if you are sensitive to loud noises in enclosed areas when the Hawks score. Crazy Pour is therefore ideal for watching hockey but also a good place as a social gathering for friends. Hopefully they do this also for Da Bears during football season, too.

Immediately upon being seated indoors (we did not go out on the patio because it was raining and we wanted to watch the Hawks game), we were greeted by a friendly and vivacious server who suggested that we try the Arancini. Despite our server and us both agreeing that they were a wee bit skimpy on the VERY tasty vodka sauce, it was excellent nevertheless. After gobbling that down rather quickly, we then chose to order the jumbo nachos, which were fully loaded with quality ingredients but quite spicy even by my own standards (I love spicy food). They also have the &#39;Not Your Dad&#39;s Root Beer&#39; beer, which I love. It tastes just like root beer and yet is a whopping 20% abv! Better yet, a pint only costs $6 there! The beer is moderately-priced and the atmosphere of this place is sporty. The location is a good but not great one. I do not think it is a good place for kids, either.

Additionally, it should be noted that Crazy Pour also has off-track betting, slot machines, a great selection of libations, cheap wings, an outdoor patio, myriad screens for watching all sorts of sports and other things on TV, and billiards tables. 

Ultimately, I give this place 5 stars because of the management/ownership of Crazy Pour. On Yelp we bought a $10 for $20 worth of food voucher. After dining, we were $4 short of meeting the $20 minimum purchase requirement with our food so, even though we were full, we were going to order an additional food item. Before we could do so, the owner Tiz came over to our table personally and generously honored the promotion anyway. I wish more establishments had that kind of accommodating customer service and they should strongly consider doing so, too, because it will invariably lead to more positive buzz on social media and more 5 star reviews on Yelp which means a win-win situation is created for everybody involved."

They have a very good selection of craft beer, including (the evening I was there) Bourbon County Stout and Smalltown Rootbeer (17.5 version).  This was a pizza place before, but they have completely redone the inside and it is quite nice.  They do OTB and some gambling machines - not my thing - but it is a big draw for some people.  The service was quite good and the owner spent some time talking about the industry and some of the hurdles owners face.  The place is sharp and laid out very well.

We ordered the baked clams and a jack and a mixed drink. Baked clams came out and they were so gross and mushy. Ordered our steak tacos and a wrap. They were both terrible. Steak was fatty and the wrap was simply terrible. Our waitress had no personality what so ever.  Big disappointment and will never recommend it to friends.

Let me begin by saying that I love to go out and watch hockey and cheer on the Blackhawks with the rest of the fans. I love the roar of the crowd and the lights and horn every time they score. However the horn at this place is terrifying! It makes your hair move and your skin vibrate. I watched one guy duck down the first time it went off because he thought he was in an attack.  

Next was the service. The girl was awkward, brought us more drinks when we didn&#39;t want any more and couldn&#39;t be found when we wanted to leave.

Finally was the music volume. I&#39;m not an 80 year old grandma, and can hear just fine. Before the Hawks game began, my friends and I were there to enjoy some apps and drinks (at 7pm) and the music was so loud we couldn&#39;t hold a conversation across the table. To make it even better, the cranked it up louder!

To round out my review, this place received the 2 stars that it did because the food quality and options were decent, along with the decor."

I am particularly fond of the Ciderboys Magic Apple and the super potent - and it goes down like concentrated root beer- Not Your Dad&#39;s ....

The food seems to be hit or miss...I have had the hit chicken wings, and they were tasty, and sometimes (Monday?) they are 50 cents a piece. The chicken wrap was good, but their fried cheese curds are slightly rubbery.

Service here has always been good, usually attractive, sweet young waitresses who are good with follow-up, if not with beer knowledge.

The building space is HUGE, with an attached OTB and TV screens all over the place.

The acoustics, much like its sister restaurant, the Overtime Bar and Grill, are bad, bad, bad, due in large part to the concrete floors.

One Sunday afternoon I was in having lunch and drinks with a friend, and although the Daytona 500 was on, there was more noise due to a party of 12 year old basketball players. And while the kids were not out-of-hand or rowdy, the cacophony produced was obnoxious. Enough so, that we left early, and so too did a group of guys wanting to watch the race.

Other than that, I really do enjoy coming to this place....."

They have a very affordable and delicious menu. If you stop in order the arancini, it&#39;s fantastic. To add to the great food, they have a pretty nice beer selection. Their bartenders are always kind and sincere, and that is something that you tend to have a hard time coming across. To add to it all they have large flat screens everywhere so you can catch the current game or watch the races. I personally enjoy reading all the hilarious names of the horses, but hey, we are all there for our own reasons... I would highly recommend this place, seriously. GO THERE!"

I was impressed walking in by the decor and layout. Then it went all downhill from there. 1. It was empty, and I mean empty we were the only two people. It was 7pm on a Sunday. The staff just hanging out around the bar. 2. We ordered our drinks and they came out just tasting like soda water, but after the third attempt in getting a simple tonic and ice ordered they asked us to order something else. Really, tonic was too difficult!!! This just made us more nervous on the food. 3. We ordered Jumbo Chicken Nachos as an appetizer and we both ordered separate sandwiches as our entrees. We waited and waited for our appetizer to arrive, and we patiently waited over a few games of darts. Then all of a sudden all of our food came at once Nachos and sandwiches. How are we going to eat nachos and our main entrees at once before each of them get cold. I ordered a grilled chicken panini and out came a grilled chicken wrap. My friend ordered a regular burger cooked medium and out came a well done cooked burger. I am not sure who is to blame here, mangers, chefs, or the waitress. But Damn we were the only two people there and they couldn&#39;t get our orders correct. We told the waitress about the faults in all of  our orders but only to get comped on the nachos and a round of drinks, which is nice of her, but I feel like the manger should have taken initiative and done better. Regardless we left early and hungry and unsatisfied paying for food we didn&#39;t even eat.

Be skeptical of this place. I won&#39;t be coming back here again."

Atleast for college sports. They played UFC on every single tv when a bunch of college football games were on including northwestern vs notre dame which I thought was a big deal around here. We asked them to switch to one of the games on ONE tv and they did, but then later got switched back. So every tv had the same thing on at once. It was annoying that we had to keep asking so eventually decided to leave and go somewhere else with football on.

The parking lot was packed so we figured this must be the place to be. The bouncer was inside the door which I was glad because it was freezing cold outside. As soon we walked in, we went up to the bar and the bartender greeted us right away. We decided to just take up 4 bar stools up at the bar so we can order drinks faster. As I look around, there was a separate room with some casino slot machines. Behind us was a section that played current music loudly. Since that section is behind us, it made us feel like there was a big rocking party behind us that we are missing out on. The music was loud but it was still okay for us to chit chat and drink at the bar. The bartender throughout the night was very attentive. The drink prices were moderate. 4 premium shots ran me $28 each time. Yes, I spent quite a bit tonight and I blame it on work. Last but not least, the bathroom was super clean.

The prices are pretty reasonable and portions are good as well. What I liked best was the environment. This place is HUGE on the inside (despite looking small on the outside)and there are TVs everywhere, along with huge private rooms if you want. PPV events and NFL Sunday ticket are here so it&#39;s great if you wanna watch sports. Games and pool tables also, with tons of space. We got a booth and it was cloth cushioned and really comfy. Service was very good, our waitress was very friendly and a perfect balance of being attentive without being a bother. Clean bathrooms too.

For starters we got cheese curds and breaded mushrooms. They were good, the cheese curds being the more impressive. Also, we got a spinach salad which was ridiculously huge. Cutting it was a part-time job.

For my meal I got the Crazy Pour burger(bacon, egg, and cheese)and fries, bun was different, but it was slightly above average. Fries are nothing to get excited about but are good. My wife got an egg bacon and cheese panini and  she rated it a 7/10.

Also, rumor has it this place has amazing thin crust pizza.

Fun place, looks new, used a $40 yelp voucher (cost $25, which is why we got so much food).

We had high hopes for the sportsbar/restaurant.   Yesterday we went to watch the bears game at noon.   My husband noticed it first but the bar was sticky and just looking at it, it looked un-clean.    We were then given 2 menus in which the menus were filthy and sticky also.    They are known for their beer pitchers that sit on table top and have a spout like a keg.   Cute idea but we looked at every one of them and fingerprints were everywhere, just looked un clean.    Even looking at the windows going into the kitchen, you have to think who cleans this place.   Kinda put us off.     Bartender not only tended the bar but worked the first row of tables, where we moved to because of the condition of the bar.     Needless to say, service lacked because the bartender should be working the bar and getting the waitresses drinks for their tables, she shouldn&#39;t be a waitress also.    Lastly, we were sitting there watching the Bears do an awful job and I have to say started rooting for Miami (lol) and this big burley man from the bar turned around and confronted us in a mean and bullying manner.    The last we checked this was a sportsbar and a free country.    He kept taunting us for the first half of the game and actually threatened us.   Well, we felt very uncomfortable and asked for our check.   We did let the bartender/waitress know about this patron.   She did go discuss with owners.   I didn&#39;t expect the owners to kick him out but knowing the types of patrons that hang at this establishment, I won&#39;t be back and I would not recommend to anyone else.    The unclean feeling of the establishment and the unclean feeling of the patrons seem to equal a place I don&#39;t want to go."

Stuffed pizza is the way to go. I didn&#39;t realize that I don&#39;t really like deep dish as much as I like the stuffed pizza. This does not come cheap as one pizza cost over $30 which is a little bit surprising given other options such as Gino&#39;s East. Although this restaurant doesn&#39;t really allow you to eat in our pizza was ready by the time it was promised it was promised there&#39;s plenty of toppings with the stuffed pizza crust was a little bit soggy but it wasn&#39;t excessively thick pizza. This would&#39;ve been heavenly if I can be eaten at fresh their. I wish they would run some promotions to make the pizza cheaper

Pros: Great stuffed pizza even better than deep dish.

Cons: Expensive and cools off very easily on the drive home

Hidden deals:
There&#39;s $10 lunch deals and after you buy your pizza they will give you coupons that you can use for the next visit. You can also sign up for the E club and sometimes they&#39;ll give you a free appetizer"

I will no longer order from this location."

The pizzas were both correctly prepared and very delicious as always. Unfortunately, the same can not be said about our chopped salad. We had ordered our chopped salad with the blue cheese and scallions on the side. The salad we received not only had blue cheese and scallions on it, but it also came with blue cheese dressing instead of the honey mustard dressing that was supposed to accompany it! It&#39;s a shame because the lettuce and other toppings all looked very fresh and delicious, but the salad was just ruined for us. I called the store to alert them of their mistake, and they said that they mixed our salad up with another group&#39;s order and offered me a $10 credit on my account for next time. Because of that error I would say this particular instance was not a 4-star experience, but due to the management offering us a credit and our experience at Giordano&#39;s usually being very good I felt generous and decided to give them the 4 stars and the benefit of the doubt that this won&#39;t happen again."

It has a small bar, booths and tables encircling it, and a salad bar I&#39;m guessing for buffets?

They do have daily specials, but their menu has quite a few options on it as well.  My first time there, I chose the sirloin steak salad, and it was a generous portion, the 2 rolls I got on the side were fresh and warm, but the salad was good, just average.

The bartender did provide the two remotes to change channels for my pleasure, and I gave up after about 30 seconds. the satellite TV boxes are behind the TV&#39;s, so it has to be at the right angle.  

Given the location of the hotel in Itasca, there aren&#39;t many dining options nearby, about 2-3 blocks to the west there are, about a 5-8 minute walk.  But it will do for what you are hungry for"

We came here after going to Geja&#39;s about a month and a half before for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday so I was eager to compare our experiences. 

We made a reservation for 7pm on a Friday night and did have to wait a bit even though we arrived right on time. We decided to sit at the bar and get a couple of drinks while we waited to be seated at our table. 

Once seated we ordered a bottle of the Michelle, Brut wine, but they didn&#39;t have any bottles left so we ended up getting a bottle of Savignon Blanc instead because they didn&#39;t have any other options for what we wanted.

We shared one serving of the Quattro Fromaggio cheese fondue to start and we both enjoyed it. The flavour was great and I liked the selection they give you to dip in the cheese. Also the fact that they mix it together at your table so you can see all the ingredients that go into it. 

For our salads we both got the Caesar which was nothing special, but you don&#39;t come here for their salads. 

For our combinations of three individual items: He went with Filet Mignon, Sesame-Crusted Ahi Tuna, and Sriracha Shrimp. And I went with Filet Mignon, Honey Orange Duck Breast, and Sriracha Shrimp. I have to say everything was delicious and fresh, and the dipping sauces were great to pair with the meat. We opted to throw in all the veggies at the beginning instead of cooking them individually. I thought it was the better option since they provide you with a slotted spoon so your food doesn&#39;t get lost in the pot. 

We knew dessert would be overkill so we just got our bill. Our server for the night was Shawn who was amazing. He provided us with top notch friendly and knowledgeable service.

Because it&#39;s only a 5 min drive for us, the prices are better, as well as the selection, we will probably come back here more often, but if it&#39;s for a special occasion we will go to Geja&#39;s because it is much more romantic."

This place is amazing!!! The atmosphere is romantic and intimate: dim lighting, light music, nice artwork. They do enforce a dress code, nothing too crazy but they do expect you to look respectful and professional. Our server was named Lily and she helped walk us through how to do everything since we&#39;ve never fondued before. She was great and always right there when we needed her.

We both got the Land &amp; Sea 4 course experience.

 It starts off with bread, apples, and veggies to dip in the cheese of your choice. We got Wisconsin Cheddar, it was good but I REALLY want to try the spinach artichoke next time. 

Next is a salad. I got the California &amp; it was awesome! Mixed greens, tomatoes, candied nuts, feta cheese &amp; raspberry vinaigrette dressing. So good!! Boyfriend got the Cesar and he said his was good too.

For the Land &amp; Sea entree you get shrimp, herb crusted chicken, filet mignon and some more veggies. My boyfriend added lobster tail to his. We chose to cook our food in a seasoned vegetable broth fondue. It was pretty good but I found it made the chicken and steak a little chewy. Next time we agreed to try the oil fondue! The entree comes with an array of sauces like teriyaki, plum sauce, curry sauce, cocktail sauce, and tzatziki. All really good but the plum was my favorite. 

For desert you choose the type of chocolate you like. We choose s&#39;mores chocolate. It was delicious. 
Melted chocolate mixed with melted marshmallow fluff and topped off with crushed graham crackers. Included with bananas, pineapple, pound cake, marshmallows, strawberries, brownies, and rice crispy treats to dunk. 

By the end of it all we were there for around 2 hours and we were stuffed to the brim. The price was as expected and I&#39;ve checked prices for other fondue places and Melting Pot was the most favorable. for the price you pay, you get an amazing meal and to spend quality time with the people you love.

I can&#39;t wait to go back!!"
the-melting-pot-schaumburg,Steven M.,PmO_nOS7aCGgCUKsesuQaQ,"Poplar Grove, IL",0,1,0,23,86,17dLFpnt7RB3mVTHnu8EiA,1.0,2016-10-15,"Wish I could give no stars.   Hate doing this but after 4 months.  Not only will I not eat at the Schaumburg location but all others as well.  I&#39;m done with all Melting Pot  restaurants because corporate has done nothing either.  I showed up without reservations on a Sunday, Father&#39;s Day, and was immediately able to be seated.  It went downhill from here.  First it took longer than usual to have the server come up.  When one finally did, my wife and I ordered drinks.  I believe she had their version of a Moscow mule and I cannot remember my order.  The drinks came back and were indescribably horrible.   Also the drinks were much smaller than that of the other Melting Pot restaurants I have frequented, Madison and Brookfield, WI.  Next we ordered our food,   I ordered the 4 course special at that time which included a Chicago style deep dish pizza theme, lobster tarragon salad, and I cannot remember my main course.  I had my wife and 12 year old twins with me, so we ordered 3 portions of the cheese.   After a long wait for the cheese (compared to my over 30 past visits), a manager finally came over with the cheese and advised that she needed to show our server how this cheese was made at the table.  Now hungry we had to wait for the manager to track down the server for a few minutes to come view how the cheese course was prepared.  Finally, she came back to the table with him and as she started making the cheese course he walked away to do something else.  The manager then stopped  making the cheese course to hunt him down again. At this point, my party was getting very hungry and when the cheese course was finally prepared, we were given a small plate of the &#39;select&#39; dippers.  Understanding that this came with my order, I asked for more bread as the plate probably would not have allowed for one portion of cheese to be consumed.   Since the server had quickly walked away the manager who was still there finishing prep was asked if we could have more bread and veggies for dipping.  After 10 minutes, we had a finished plate of &#39;dippers&#39; and still had a pot full of cheese.  The server finally came back and we asked for bread and veggies again,  this time he looked at me like I was an idiot.  Keep in mind I have been stirring the cheese in an attempt to not have it burn for about ten minutes.  We would finally get more bread but no veggies about five minutes later.  &#39;More bread&#39; consisted of 8 small pieces that again had no chance of consuming the cheese left in the pot.   We did our best to finish the cheese now semi-burnt, with what we had.  As stated before, I ordered three portions of cheese and again felt the three portions were a bit smaller compared to other locations, but can say it was an advantage on this day.  Also, I forgot to mention that while waiting for the cheese another server came by and sneezed on my wife, just looked at her, said nothing, and walked away.   At this point, my wife looked at me and said if you think we should leave I am willing to do so.   In 34 years, I have had numerous sub par meals out and have never walked out on a meal.  Tonight was the first time, so I walked to the front and asked to see the manager.  I explained that I would like to settle my bill and that I had a very negative experience and was choosing to end it at that point.   The manager just asked, &#34;Is fondue just not your thing?&#34;.  I again stated the drinks were horrible and that I regularly eat at the Melting Pot.  I believe I stated I just wanted to cut my losses and leave at this point. After feeling insulted, I still wanted to finish this without making any type of scene.  I settled a $50 tab that consisted of 2 drinks and the cheese course with two portions (they didn&#39;t even get the portions correct).  The worst part is I still tipped 10% because of having family and friends who are servers.  

      The next day I did call corporate who relayed that they let the individual stores handle complaints first.  The general manager (GM) Steve called me a few days later.  The call left me feeling insulted since I was asked how the cheese burning was their fault.  I nicely explained how their heating element was working correctly causing the liquid base in the cheese to evaporate.  And the amount of time it took to get the meager amount of dippers, the liquid had evaporated causing the cheese to burn.  The end result was a $25 gift card.  I then advised Steve the meal was $50 and that no part of the experience was enjoyable.  He agreed to mail a $50 gift card and took my information down.  He however failed to get my Zip code for mailing.  After hanging up I believed he would just google the city for the Zip code.  Two months later still no gift card.  I called back and evidently he only works on Wednesdays.  I did get one call back from the three times I called but unfortunately I could not answer.  I have called back and called corporate again but this remains unresolved at this time, 4 months later."

What? While we were waiting we talked to the couple next to us and they said they were waiting for 30 minutes even though they had a reservation and had arrived on time. So they too were shocked that the no-reservation party was being seated before them. The group was made up of four young girls all dolled up... it really made us wonder if they were getting special treatment.

Server at the front was far from friendly. Half the time he was talking with his coworkers. When my husband and I told him we only wanted to grab dessert he sort of started ignoring us?!

Anyway, once we were finally seated it thankfully went uphill. Our server was wonderful and he constantly checked up on us. We got just one drink and the dessert set. We weren&#39;t treated any different or less  than other diners who were there for a full meal. Food was okay. Dessert is just your standard chocolate fondue with fruits/sweets, which is pretty hard to mess up. Quantity was small but we knew to expect that coming in. 

Came for the experience. Would I try going back for a full meal? Maybe, but most likely not."

Yep - that&#39;s about the only way we get out these days.  I was kind of excited about going here because we had been once before and really enjoyed it. My husband made reservations and we got there a few minutes late, but there were plenty of tables open. We were starving so were a bit disappointed when they didn&#39;t seat us right away. But, the part owner came over to seat us and apologized for making us wait. So, we were gently calmed by that. We were seated at a really great corner booth so away from hustle and bustle. Our waitress Courtney was really sweet, if not a bit Type A about her job. We got out of her that it was really busy and busier than they expected - after all it was only a Monday night! We assured her we were there to relax and not to worry. 

We ordered a bottle of Zin. The bartender came over himself to let us know they were out of that bottle so we ordered a Malbec from Argentina which was a few dollars less. Hey - I love wines from Argentina and Malbecs so when it arrived and it was really great, I was happy we didn&#39;t get that Zin from Cali. Later, for dessert (yea we splurged), I got a champagne. I think he must have either poured the wrong one or had one sitting there, because they brought us two - one on the house. One was very flat (maybe it was a Cava) and neither of us liked it. The other was my Prosecco which was tasty. Again, a nice gesture. I just cared that what I ordered was good.

Okay - so you&#39;ve heard the small hiccups in our visit. But they were so small, I would only take off a quarter of a star. The rest of the experience was SO great and that&#39;s why I gave it a 5 star review.

The owner came over a couple times to make sure we were happy. We were.

Our groupon came with salad. Craig ordered his and asked for no iceberg and they were happy to do that. I ordered the one with all mixed greens and it came with just spinach. That&#39;s just fine by me - it was baby spinach and it was so tender and delicious. At the end I even dipped my finger in the leftover dressing because it was so good. 

The groupon included 3 choices of one section of entrees. I had shrimp, salmon fillet and Tuna. Craig had Tuna, Pork and Fillet Mignon. I got to taste his pork and he had some of my shrimp and salmon.  Lots of food here!! We also got the Mojo cooking sauce. This was another hiccup - for some reason this was a special order and we weren&#39;t informed. But, it was REALLY good and it was only 5 bucks extra so we just kind of laughed it off. You know - when your food is amazing and you are totally relaxed because of the atmosphere, little things are okay. Veggies are included - broccoli, mushroom, potatoes. 

So, the dipping sauces were delicious. I loved the yogurt and curry the best. The herbed butter was really great with the potatoes and the pork and fillet mignon.  They also had a plum sauce, a teriyaki, horseradish cocktail sauce and something else that was good but I don&#39;t know what it was. We didn&#39;t get any cheese to dip in.

We used our phone to time the cooking. I think they should provide a way to time your cooking because the meat is 2 minutes and the seafood is 1.5 minutes and the veggies are 6 minutes. In this day, everyone has a smart phone - wait, not my mom or my sister!! So, they need a timer. Maybe if we had asked.... But we were fine.

SO much food!!!  I was SOOOO full when I finished my food!  And it was really really healthy!!  No starches except a few potatoes. We both really enjoyed it.

I have a suggestion that they use induction cooktop so that the cooktop doesn&#39;t get so hot. Then the booth won&#39;t get so hot either.  Just me being an interior designer who knows that stuff.  And it is recent technology. So maybe in a year or two....

We ordered dessert which was not on the menu. We got crunchy peanut butter mixed in chocolate. My favorite was the marshmallow rolled in oreo and dipped in the chocolate. YUM!  They also had brownie, blond brownie, banana (yummy!), pineapple, strawberry, pound cake and rice krispy treats. All very good and we had leftover chocolate so plenty. Oh yea - we didn&#39;t think about it but the dessert was 10 bucks per person. OUCH.

On our way out, the owner asked us if we were happy. Yes. Delicious!!  And then we left to go watch the Cubs lose the 3rd Playoff game against the Giants. I got to bed at 2:48 am. Thankfully, my stomach had enough time to digest the food before I went to bed.

Go. Relax. Enjoy. This place was really good!  The food was fabulous. Courtney was really great and fast. The bartender and owner were very attentive. Definitely worth your time and calories!

Oh and they just redid the bar area. It looks really nice. They are putting in a TV. Yuck. But I&#39;m probably the only person who cares about that. Interior Design again."

The cheese fondue with veggies, bread, and apples to dip. That was delicious. But then again. I may be biased... I love cheese. 

The strawberry salad I had was awesome. I usually am not crazy for salad, but it was very yummy. 

The entree....We cooked the meats ourselves. It was a fun experience. You soak the meat in broth and then dip in these different sauces. It wasn&#39;t the most delicious meal ever... But it was more about the experience. I probably wouldn&#39;t come back for the entree, (expensive and not as flavorful as id like) but it was still fun.

Now desert. We got desert enhancements and turtle fondu. It was so so so delicious. Oreo marshmallows, strawberries, pound cake, rice crispies, and a decadent cheesecake slice, were some of our dippables. I love chocolate. So I was in love lol! We were sooo full but we pounded the entire desert.

We left 2.5 hours later very full and happy!  Will keep hinting on another date night here... Just cheese and chocolate though."

So I expected the long ENJOYABLE dinner experience. What I didn&#39;t expect was it to be so long and NOT SO enjoyable because of our reservation not being ready and terribly long service delays.

Our reservation was for 7:30 for two people for a birthday. We made them a week in advance in their website. We arrived a little early (7:20); the hostess seemed a little annoyed, directing us to the bar, saying &#34;we will be with in a bit&#34;. We grabbed a drink (a glass of Malbec and the Mangolicious, $21) and at 7:50... Finally got seated in a mini booth in the back. The point of the reservation? Who knows... 

Our server was very sweet and very friendly but either she was over sat or overwhelmed. It took forever to get anything... To the point she was apologizing a lot, which was appreciated. But showed some flaws; either the restaurant doesn&#39;t know how to appropriately staff, the hostess doesn&#39;t know how to seat, the server was having a bad night, or the kitchen was slow. Either way, it made for a not good experience for us. 

We did the 4 course dinner. The 40th anniversary cheese was ok, I wouldn&#39;t get it again and I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone that they have to try it. It lacked something. Salads are salads. The actual meal was good (surf &amp; turf and fondue delight). 

I agree with people mentioning that portions seem smaller, especially the veggie sides. 

Our chocolate fondue was good as well. We had the turtle. It think it&#39;s kind of cheap on Melting Pots part that cheesecake bites are an up charge now. 

The bussers were a bit pushy trying to take plates and dishes too. We were still eating and they were trying to take our dishes. It was very intrusive and obnoxious. It happened more than once too. 

None of these issues were worth seeking out a manager, but if one of the two wandering around the floor bothered to stop over, we would have gladly told them.   

For the overall cost, the experience should be better. Our server did her best, but can only work with what she&#39;s given too."

The host at the front of the house wasn&#39;t overly enthusiastic about his position. We decided to do the unlimited fondue and all started out rather well.  The server was personable and attentive.  After the cheese course, we had an over eager  buser whom felt like he was breathing down our necks for us to finish.  Brushed that off and had a fine salad course and main entree course.  Once again, the over eager buser was on the scene making us feel rushed and uncomfortable.  After our main entree, our server then asked if we were going to skip the last course since his other tables said they were too full for dessert!?!?   We said, no, we&#39;d like the dessert course as it was part of the unlimited fondue special.  Mind you, we were not going to town on the unlimited aspect of the meal.  The only extra we asked for was a half portion of our main entree.  So, the dessert comes, and our server presents us with the check without asking if we&#39;d like more dessert.  We did not, but again, his assumption we were done was annoying.  Soon after, the buser, whom must be in a massive rush to get somewhere , started to clear all the glasses from the table including my water which I was still drinking.  Between 3 of us, we spent over $200. I have never spent $75 on a meal for myself in my life.  It was a big treat,  and for that money, I expected the service to reflect that dollar amount.  The more I think about, the more upset I get.  I&#39;m sure these gentleman would expect good service if they were spending so much of their hard earned money on a meal.  
As for the restaurant itself, it should be much nicer for what they charge.  The booth had tape on it, and the bathroom had a leaky roof complete with a Tupperware container collecting the falling water."

It was somewhere we had both been in the past and did enjoy so it seemed like a good choice. I had made reservations through their online reservations system for 745pm for 8-2-16.  We arrived early, about 720 so we waited in the car for a bit before heading in so we didn&#39;t have to stand around waiting on our reservation. We went into the restaurant about 740pm. There was no one at the host stand to greet us so we just stood around. Someone had come up to us and I greeted them with &#34;hi how are you?&#34; he responded by putting his index finger up as if to say &#34;one moment&#34; and just walked away with saying nothing. Several minutes later we were greeted by the actual host who sat us promptly and gave us menus, right at about 745pm the time of our reservation. The host had asked us if we had ever been before and we said yes. He then informed us that our server would be &#34;Olivia&#34; and she would be with us shortly. While we waited we noticed 2 other tables get seated in the tables around us and both tables were greeted with a server immediately and given glasses of water. We still hadn&#39;t seen our server or been given or offered anything to drink. at 800pm we both became a bit annoyed as it seemed everyone around us was getting service and we were not. By 810pm we agreed to leave and go elsewhere. 

How annoying! First of all, you make a reservation for a reason. Second of all, The melting pot is grossly over priced and if we choose to spend our hard earned money there, then we better at least get good service. Sitting for more than 20 minutes ON A RESERVATION is completely unacceptable. We will never return after this experience. We went to Big Bowl in Schaumburg instead and were seated immediately and greeted within 3 minutes by our server for our drink orders. Honestly, the food was probably better too :)"

When we arrived, at 6:25 for out 6:30 reservation, we were greeted by two hosts, a younger boy/girl pairing, that took our name (I gave my last, she called me by my first). and were promptly seated in a two person booth in the main dining area on the main server path. I thanked the gentleman for the table and asked him if there was anything more &#34;private&#34; available. I was informed that the restaurant only had one private booth and it was already taken. My wife was handed a menu, as was i, then a drink menu, then a drink special menu, then an anniversary card from the manager (nice touch) and we were rapidly told about the Fondue across America, specials and a host of other things that were given too quickly to comprehend. The young man told us that our server would be over in a moment to help us at our now very crowded table. The first thing i noticed what that there was no place to put anything down. The two person table was very small and was barely enough room for glasses let alone a table side wine aerator which we had used previously. THe small leather bench seat sloped to one side and I felt like I was sliding out the entire time. The wall sconce was covered in dust and shook when the table in the upper section bumped the wall. 

Our server came within 2 minutes and asked us if we knew what we wanted to drink. we said we were unsure, because the menu had changed quite a bit. The server told us that they had gotten ride of all the thick menus because they were in bad repair and then pointed to my menu and said that i had gotten it too close to the heating element and it was now warping. We asked for a minute on the drinks as we looked at the mixed cocktails and she promptly left stating that she would bring us water and took with her the wine list and wine glasses. (its important to note that we did not say that we didnt&#39; want wine, only that we were looking at what drinks we DID want). When she came back she asked if we had decided on dinner and we said we wanted to order our drink first but we knew that we would be getting the 4 course meal. My wife ordered a long island varient, and I ordered a craft beer. 

The drink orders were placed and we were again asked if we at least knew what type of cheese we wanted so that could be started. Before we could make a selection the waitress stated that we should do anything except the cheddar (my personal favorite). I asked why and she said, oh, you could totally do cheddar. I noted that 3 of the 6 cheese fondues were a cheddar variety. I asked for one more minute to decide because the menu was very new to us and seemed complicated. she left. 

The bartender brought our drinks over and place my wife&#39;s down before handing me a bottle of beer and a glass. This young man was very unkempt; his hair was a mess, his shirt nearly un-tucked, and his tie was tied to his mid-chest (about 5 inches short). 

We ordered the Wisconsin Cheddar and considered adding a craft beer, but this was neither offered, suggested, or raved about. So we stuck with the traditional lager beer mix. My wife asked if the watermelon and feta salad was any good and the waitress rolled her eyes and said it just watermelon and cheese... I wouldn&#39;t do it. She then commented that the house dressing had changed and that she would bring it on the side. I ordered a Cesar salad and a classic meat fondue while my wife order a house salad and beef and pot sticker fondue with coq a vin broth. (Note: these have different names on the menu, but honestly, I no longer care what they are actually called.)

The cheese was brought out quickly and hastily thrown in the pot and mixed up with barely and explanation of was was going in the mix. A small bowl of rye bred, sour dough, and 3 pieces of pretzel were tossed on the table with a small bowl of apples and vegetables. Without so much as an enjoy, our waitress was gone. I snickered at my wife who rolled her eyes and we began to eat. 

The cheese as expected was wonderful, although the vegetables consisted of wilted broccoli and dusty white carrots. The bread was not super fresh, but probably within standards, but the apple was good. Before we were half way through with our cheese our salads were tossed on the table. 

I had much more, but let me TL:DR this because it keeps getting snipped by Yelp.... don&#39;t go here save your money or go somewhere else that will treat you better. 

    - Your Cheese, although thrown together, was still tasty. I finished mixing all the Worcestershire sauce into to it, and it was great.
    - The meal, was as expected but the portions are much smaller
    - The green goddess sauce is still one of my wife&#39;s favorites
    - The Chocolate, was rich and creamy.

The Bad:
    - Service
    - Atmosphere
    - Quality of dipping items
    - Cleanliness"

We were greeted with a nice and warm welcome. When we were seated we had a wonderful romantic table decorated with rose petals, red roses in a vase, balloons and heart shape candles. Obviously they put lots of thought and kindness to make this happen and I personally want to express our appreciation to Mr. Steve for that. The food was excellent as always. After we paid the bill Mr. Steve come to us and fix a mistake on the bill. It was really thoughful and kind of him to show such care to Melting Pot guests. We want to emphasize it is awsome to have people with a mindset of caring and we very much appreciate Mr. Steven&#39;s hospitality.

We had the four course meal- house salad, loaded baked potato cheddar for our cheese fondue-you can ask for refill on the bread, the original and steak lover for entrees and chocolate s&#39;mores for our chocolate fondue-you can ask for refill on the strawberries, banana, pineapple, marshmallow, pound cake or brownies to dip!"

The filet mignon and the duck breast were split in chunks and ure cooking them yourself in this pot they give u filled w boiling broth. The broth was a watery weird smelling thing w a pinch of orange. I cooked my meat and some pieces i had to literally take them out of my mouth w a napkin to avoid throwing up!

Was afraid I would be late for work tomorrow. Server was way off pace. Solid two hours and that was without dessert. 

The four for $99 is not a great deal, order off the menu so you have more choices and maybe your waiter will actually serve you and pay attention. Have friends that visit more often, but go with a specific server who is very good. They just didn&#39;t seem up to the task this evening. 

Have had very good meals other visits and are members of the fondue club. This time will probably be the last for some time. Life is to short to spend that long receiving mediocre food from a disinterested waiter."

We were charged more for our bottle of wine than we were supposed to be, and full price for every adult. The chef hats they were promised didn&#39;t fit, even remotely.

We got there for five or ten minutes before an 8:30 reservation.  Half the tables were empty, but we had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  By this time I had started freaking our because I was on a schedule to be home to feed my infant.  Glad I said something to the host (who I assume to be the manager).  He immediately started our cheese when we sat down.  I wish the other courses would have come a little faster, but glad that at least one wait time was cut down.  I have been here before and love everything except the chocolate fondue (too much for me).  The cheese fondue and all the dipping sauces are my fav, as well as the yin yang martini.  The beef was especially awesome that night too.
The only other annoyance was this table of women who were so loud it was ridiculous, but there isn&#39;t a whole lot management could have done about that besides move us (which we obviously did not have time for).  I mean there were even times we had to yell to hear each other across the table, and they were at least 3 tables down."

I had always wanted to try this restaurant, so when the Marine wives decided to get together for our monthly outing, I was excited! Being 8 months pregnant, I figured it would be a nice night out for dinner and I could be home at a reasonable hour. I thought wrong. Our reservation was at 7 and we were still waiting to pay at 11:15! I finally gave my
friend cash for my portion of the bill and headed home in hopes of not being up all night sick from eating so late. Never did I think I would maybe be home by midnight with a 7 PM reservation! 

We look forward to our monthly outings because we rarely see our husbands and the get-togethers provide some much needed &#34;adult time.&#34; This experience was extremely disappointing and far from enjoyable. We had a group of 13 people crammed in a corner and only one server was assigned to us. It was quite a lot of work for him to even do drink orders himself, and about half of us weren&#39;t even drinking anything other than water! Needless to say, it was at least an hour in between courses and the portions were very small for the amount they cost. My salad didn&#39;t even have any dressing on it, but I was so starving by the time it finally came that I just ate it. I didn&#39;t want to wait another 20 minutes to get dressing. 

We had purchased Living Social vouchers prior to coming. That was a nightmare when it finally came time for the checks. The checks must have been run four different times until our whole group finally waited by the door, tempted to just walk out (it was after 11:00). The manager was involved at this point, but expressed no sincere apology. He said. &#34;Thanks for telling us because otherwise we wouldn&#39;t know. We just thought you ladies were enjoying your time catching up.&#34; Maybe if he had come over to our table just once in the 4 hours we were sitting there he would have seen the look of boredom, frustration, and starvation on our faces. 

As I was walking out, I heard the manager, John, tell the group that dessert will be taken off the bill. Real
nice- one person ordered dessert and the other people who ordered dessert never even got it. 

This was a huge disappointment of an experience I very much looked forward to and the worst management I&#39;ve ever seen in a restaurant."

Near the end he brought out a small plate with just a few of those pieces and, &#34;Yay desert!&#34; was written in chocolate. That was a nice touch :) 

I also ordered hot chocolate which was just okay and served without whip cream. No biggie but in a place like that I would expect something a little bit more fancy. At the very least presentation over taste."

The bathrooms here are freaking nasty. There&#39;s piss all over the floor. The toilet seat has cigarette burns on it, it&#39;s barely attached and does not fully flush. I&#39;ve seen better gas station toilets. This is the second time this week I&#39;ve been here and they have them in the same condition. If the bathrooms look like this, imagine how nasty the kitchen could be. 

Second time this week I had to send the silverware back to the kitchen because it was dirty.

If they got their act together with the bathrooms and the cleanliness here, this would be a four star place."

Nathan the server was amazing and very helpful with the menu. I had the four cheese to start. It was perfect. For entree I had the pick three. I chose duck, sausage and tuna. First time I&#39;ve had duck. It was alright. The sausage was nothing special. And the tuna was a little fishy for my taste. For dessert I had the Original - chocolate and peanut butter. That&#39;s was yummy. The  manager cleared my entree dishes and brought my dessert. He was friendly as well. It was good and I&#39;m glad I did it but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to do it again."

Went in today (Sunday) at about 2:30. Took about 5 minutes to find someone to seat me and my son, even though the place was empty. Got seated, nice gentleman server. Couple things to note on service: he brought the wrong cheese fondue, although I didn&#39;t notice until after we ate it and checked the menu. Forgot the extra side plate of meats for the fondue, but eventually brought it, and I had sent back because we were on to the meat meal. Brought the wrong red wine, but forgot forgot to charge me for the second glass, so..... Nice server, but slow, and forgetful. Server was good at explaining the sauces, so that was nice. Ying yang chocolate fondue was delicious, def recommend. Price seemed fair for what we ate, service was forgetful, but attentive and tried. Would do again. Decor seemed a little dated, could use a nice brush-up."

I rarely write review about a place. But an experience this bad should be heard by many. This place either should get a reality check or learn how to do business in service industry.

It&#39;s been 48 hr since we&#39;ve been there, but all of our clothes still stink like we were dipped in the old dishwater..

Nobody was at the concierge, we walked in at 5:30 pm, waited a few minutes, decided to walk in further to look if anyone was even in this place. Only 2 tables were occupied, walked around the empty tables. Someone we ran into ordered us to leave the area and wait by the door, so we did. Another party walked in, finally there were 6 different parties by the door by 5:50, someone came and asked &#34;anyone with reservations?&#34; I said &#34;we came first, tables are all empty, don&#39;t you need to ask who came first?&#34;. He ignored and walked around the crowd and grabbed people who claimed to have reservation. After he grabbed the second party with reservation, I said I am leaving. The man at the door with an attitude said &#34;be patient!&#34; Without even looking at my face. If I wasn&#39;t there for an appointment with my other party, I would have walked out when the dishwater stink hit my face; which was a loud indication of unprofessionalism. I wish I did. Things got worse.

Food was absolutely lowest degree, mediocre, for the $$$ price range they charge. For 4 people, we ordered only 1 MEAL it was $16, 2 pop drinks, 3 salads $5.5 ea, 1 chocolate fondue. Bill was $102.00 with tip. I have not even eat or drink anything, but water!

People who says this place has good food has never eaten good food, obviously!

Waitress also had an absolute worst attitude, lack of elegance and experience.

We walked out smelly, angry and hungry. I will never ever go there again. Even if they offer free. Not worth to waste my time."

When you make a reservation for 14 people, you would expect expect it to accommodate 14 people. This was not the case. They shoved us in a booth with a table next to it that barely sat 9 of us. Then they pulled in chairs and put them around the booth. Very crammed and uncomfortable. 

They had the reservation a few days in advance and we were the only large party in there. Honestly I think they forgot about our party and stuck us where they could. 

The service was bad. I don&#39;t know if the guy was new or just not that great at being a server. It wasn&#39;t his fault really. He was clearly over whelmed and needed help. He was nice and you could tell he really tried. Alas, we didn&#39;t eat anything until after 9:30. 

At one point the empty pots in front of us had to be replaced because they were on for so long. The water had been boiling for over an hour and the server said, if we don&#39;t replace these pots and start new, everything will burn. 

The salad wasn&#39;t much of a salad either. It was a couple pieces of lettuce. Super small portion of a salad honestly. I ordered caesar salad and it had nuts in it.  I&#39;ve never had a caesar salad with nuts before.  Honestly I was so hungry I didn&#39;t bother to complain. I just ate it. 

Dinner comes and it&#39;s fine, except I feel like all I got was meat. The side of potato, mushrooms and broccoli consisted of one small potato quartered, 1 broccoli floret and 3 mushroom caps. We were to share that with the 4 women at the one pot. 

Then to top all of this off we had living social vouchers. We told the server as soon as we sat down we had them and told him they were for dinner for 2.  We were all paired off so really all we would have had to sort out was drinks and if you ordered anything extra. This was a disaster when it came time to pay our bill. 

When we were there we watched people around us come in, sit, eat, and leave. A table was turned twice while we sat there! Never did I ever think I would be going out for a meal from 7-12. I would never ever go with a large party to this place. You may want to eat before going to. Portions are for people who aren&#39;t really hungry."

Maybe 10 tables, we waited at the bar and the bartender had no idea how to make a drink. I ordered a southern comfort and ginger ale. She asked if I&#39;d like that in a martini glass?? Then she told me how it was her first night she used to be a hostess. 

We sit down and our waiter was rude and not very helpful. I ordered another drink while we sat down and took 16 mins to get my drink and a glass of water. 

The manager was running around very disorganized. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Save your money and go to an organized place to eat"

I wasn&#39;t too keen on what I had heard about me having to do all my own cooking!  Lol.  Well, it turns out that I had a blast!!  The food was delicious and it was alot of fun with friends!  I totally would of rated this place 5 stars but our waiter was a little slow.  We waited a half hour for a salad and he kept bringing the wrong drinks but as far as ambiance and quality of the food, it was great!  We had the combination plate which was chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, and I think filet....it was so good and believe it or not, so filling. I really didn&#39;t think this was going to fill me up because the portions didn&#39;t seem that big but they really were so filling!  This meal included a salad and a desert.  And just when you think your so stuffed, you have to indulge in the desert....oh my!  I must say, probably the best desert I have ever had!!!  I forgot the name of it but it was dark chocolate with bananas, strawberries, brownies, cookies, cake....oh my!!!

I will say that the food was 100% amazing but the service was SO SO bad and for the $$ we spent there I was expecting much better service then we got. It took 20 min fir our waitress to say hello and take our drink orders, which they were short bartender so it took 40min to get the drinks that tasted like crap so those were on the house. Problem is, we got our cheese fondue and our waitress didnt ask if they wanted water while they were waiting for their drinks , they had to ask for them. We needed to remind her to add the red wine in our cooking oil, which that was the main ingredient and the reason we picked it!!!! Everything we asked for, it took at least two times of asking to get it! We were there for 3 HOURS!!! I could see if it was bc we ate and stayed and chatted... NO it was bc everything too sooooo long. We waited to be greeted and our drink order taken, four our first course to come, for the chocolate menu ( which we asked for before we started eating so we can be ready but never got) another 10min for our chocolate order to be taken... Ugh we were all so pissed and disappointed plus plain tired of sitting and waiting!
The bathrooms were very dirty and they had two chairs in there w all these stains on it , it was just gross i think i might have gotten herpes if i sat on one. Again, its way too nice of a place and spend way too much $ for there to be a nasty dirty bathroom, yuck! The cooking shows always say, take a look at a places bathroom and it will tell you about the restaurant... Hmmm maybe a repeat visit isnt such a great idea!"

We made reservations each time and were seated right away, except for last night. We arrived and were told it would be about 5 minutes before our table was ready. This was no problem to us at all, but the manager came over and told us to go order a drink at the bar on him! This was totally unexpected and very thoughtful, especially since it was only 5 minutes we would have had to wait! The bartender made us custom drinks and was very personable. The food is pricey but really good! Each time we went we did the four-course meal. It&#39;s a fun experience and not for those who want a quick meal.

I used to go to the one in Buffalo Grove, but they have since closed down, which is even worse news to me now that I have found out how the Schaumburg location is. :( 

I came here 2/11/15, a Wednesday night, for a valentines dinner with my boyfriend (getting in ahead of the crowd).  I was so excited, literally have been begging to go for a year now.

We arrived and were seated promptly, it wasn&#39;t too busy especially considering it was a Wed. night.  My boyfriend and I both ordered drinks, he had an angry orchard, I had their white moscato.  Both were alright.  

Our server, TJ was alright.  He was not super attentive as we had long wait times in between pots, and he was not great at checking up to see if we needed anything while dining.  I know the waits between pots is usually existent, but for how slow the restuarat was, I feel we waited longer than usual.

My favorite part is the apples and cheese, luckily, the apples tasted pretty fresh.  The cheese fondue was very tasty, something with mozzarella and tomatos.  The bread and vegetables on the other hand, did not taste so fresh.  The normally delicious brown bread was SO DRY AND STALE.  The vegetables were dry and definitely looked like they had been sitting in a fridge for quite some time. Also, I noticed the portions they give you for dipping have decreased quite a bit, which is fine since you can get refills on these (which I did end up with more apples, thankfully)

Next was salad.  I always look forward to the caesar salads here as they are always tasty.  Sadly, when we received our salads, the lettuce was browning on the edges and tasted wilted.  Salad size was also significantly smaller than I remember.  

Next, we had our entree.  I had &#34;The Classic&#34; my boyfriend had the steak lovers.  We used the oil (bourggeoine, however you spell it).  The meats were alright, except the &#34;filet mignon&#34; which did honestly tasted worse than the teriyaki sirloin.  Also, the sides, veggies, potatoes, etc. were again way smaller portions than normal.  For our entree, our server was basically nowhere to be found so we were unable to request more sides.  Our server also forgot the batters that typically come with the oil, so we had to request these from the manager, whom by the way awkwardly passes and eavesdrops his tables FAR more than any manager should. Every now and then is great, but c&#39;mon man, back off a little while we&#39;re eating.  

Finally, we had our chocolate.  So sad to see that the dessert treats they give you at the end have also significantly decreased in quantity.  We probably received about half of what I used to receive when I attended Melting Pot about 2 years ago.  No more cheesecake, far less fruit and dippables.  The strawberries did not taste too fresh either, pretty crunchy.  The chocolate sauce menu has been cut tremendously as well.  What used to be at least 8...9..10 choices, is now about 3 or 4, and they definitely aren&#39;t as adventurous chocolate flavors as what I&#39;ve had in the past.  

Our bill was higher than I&#39;ve ever spent at Melting Pot, granted I had two drinks, my boyfriend had one, but that is pretty typical for every visit I&#39;ve ever had.  

Ultimately, I&#39;m disappointed with the experience.  Everything was just a huge let down from teh last time I went.  Way less food, making it way less bang for your buck.  The quality of everything seems to have all around decreased, while the price seems to have gone up.  

I will not be going back, it is not worth the money.  This makes me so sad to say because I used to love this place, but it definitely was not the same experience I&#39;ve had many times in the past.

***Another important thing to note: Maybe I&#39;m crazy, but I definitely remember receiving a hot mitt cover to cover up the HOT fondue pot handle.  We never received a cover to this handle, which made it pretty difficult to do our fondue while the pot was spinning all around and neither of us wanted to grab the hot handle."
the-melting-pot-schaumburg,Sam P.,CmKQyk8CfMVjoj-l4HepEw,"Wheaton, IL",1,1,1,57,78,xvuiYKAT9-7KlGYWQcyS8g,2.0,2014-03-23,"We were here with a group of 20ish to celebrate a birthday in the family. I did not handle any of the logistics of booking or payment, so I write this purely from the perspective of a guest.

The ambiance of Melting Pot is rich and romantic. Paintings of chocolate fondue, soft lighting, and sturdy furnishings set the mood. As far as restaurant layout goes, we were split between 6 tables of 4 right in the middle of the restaurant. I was sitting in a place that sort of felt in the middle of traffic, so I had to move gingerly if I needed to attend to my children or use the restroom.

Speaking of restroom, I found both soap dispensers in the women&#39;s room completely empty. The staff quickly filled them when I alerted them to the issue, but really? Such a &#34;nice&#34; restaurant should be all over things like that. I mean, they require regular filling, right? Also, no changing table, which is a huge drawback in my book. I did appreciate the seats in the restroom though, where I could at least perch to change babe&#39;s diaper.

As far as food goes, we had two courses. We skipped the cheese fondue appetizer, which I heard is widely appealing. We did enjoy our main course, for which each guest could choose 3 meats. I had sausage, shrimp, and filet, all of which were pleasing. I would recommend maybe skipping the sausage though, as the shrimp and steak were much tastier. My son found the chicken noteworthy too, so that might be worth a try. Several members of our party enjoyed the salmon and recommend cooking it for a shorter amount of time than is recommended (like, 30 seconds if you can stomach lightly coked fish).

Dessert, obviously the real reason anyone even eats here. Fruit, cheesecake, brownies, marshmallows, all dipped in chocolate? Yes, please! We ordered the white and dark chocolates, and it was a very pleasing combination.

Overall, the food was enjoyable. Not a good value at all, but a cool place to go for the experience. I can see why a 10 year old would choose it for her birthday celebration.

The reason I&#39;m giving Melting Pot two stars rather than three or four, is due to the service. As I previously mentioned, our party was split among six tables, and I don&#39;t think they did a good job preserving the &#34;experience&#34; for us at all. Instructions for cooking were not given clearly to each table, and I would have liked an explanation of how the whole fondue deal is supposed to work. Instead, the attention given to each table was sporadic at best, and we didn&#39;t even see the chocolate being melted into our dessert pan, which I think is supposed to be a presentation. I also never got a drink refill I requested, and we had to flag down someone to ask each time we needed more water. 

This was definitely an enjoyable way to celebrate my niece&#39;s birthday. If you&#39;ve never been to Melting Pot, it&#39;s worth a try, even if you never go back. On the way out, I noticed a Monday night promotion for $18.99 that includes cheese fondue and dessert. No main course there, but perhaps a better value and a good way to try it out if you&#39;re new to fondue. It took us about 2.5 hours for two courses, so do allow plenty of time for your visit."

I have been to the one in Downers Grove but I wanted a local please close to the house for Mom&#39;s Night Out!  There were 7 of us and we sat at the bar at first and the manager bought us a round to start off our night...SCORE!  Then we were seated at a table by the window with a U shape with 2 chairs in the front.  Our server was training someone and I can&#39;t remember his name or hers but they were excellent. She answered all our questions as we had A LOT.  I think 3 of us were new to the Melting Pot while others had been but it had been a while.  The manager checked on us at the end to make sure our dining experience was good.  The only draw back was the time in which we were there.  Some of us opted for an entrée while a few just wanted cheese and chocolate.  That left them with nothing to eat/do while we &#34;fondued&#34;.  Then one of the Moms became upset towards the end that she couldn&#39;t get her check right away so she left her cash and left.  I know fondue takes a while but I think we expected to be done by 9pm.  Our reservation was at 6:30 and we didn&#39;t leave til after 10pm on a Tuesday night.  All in all I had a great time.  We enjoyed the Crave Tuesday special which consisted of 2 glasses of wine, cheese and choclate for $25 on a Tuesday night.  There was also a 40th anniversary 3 course for $40 but none of us opted for that.  I personally had the filet, cheese (cheedar and alpine), cooking style Mojo.  The girls opted for the bunt cake chocolate (limited edition) and the toffee/turtle?"

I understand that the restaurant was having problems with firing some poor trainees in the very recent past, but having to wait another 20 minutes after our reservation to be sat was a little steep. And then waiting another 10 minutes to be greeted by the server. Our reservation was for 7:30 and we didn&#39;t get a bite to eat until after 8:30. 

I recommend the artichoke cheese dip and the caprese salad to start off with. 

As far as entrees goes, do not get chicken. 

And you can&#39;t go wrong with dessert. Yin &amp; Yang was delicious. Although make sure to get a nice glass of milk! It&#39;ll make everything taste better."

I eat pizza with cheese and a little chicken Parmesan with cheese when it&#39;s well done, but that&#39;s about it. So why go to a fondue restaurant?  Well, at the request of my sister and cousin of course!

We went in on a Monday night after work. Both of them made separate reservations, so we were practically guaranteed a table. Oops!  Actually, we basically had the place to ourselves for the first half hour or so. 

We sat in front of the fireplace.  It was warm and cozy. I liked that a lot. I didn&#39;t feel like I was in a chain establishment based on the look of the restaurant. 

Our server was training a new server, but that went well too. The trainee had enough knowledge to keep things moving even without the trainer over her. She asked questions when needed, but it was obvious that she had either read &#34;the manual&#34; or watched video tutorials or something equally helpful. As the restaurant for busier, I do recall a little trouble keeping our glasses filled, but the service was decent up until that point. 

Since I don&#39;t eat the cheese course and just watched during that time, I had a salad, a duck/steak/shrimp combo and the dessert. The salad alone was worth coming back for. If it is available as a carryout item, I would probably even do that. The pine nuts were such a nice change up. I ate every bite!  Duck is newer to me. I&#39;ve had it a few times at special events where it was part of an appetizer, but sort of hidden within the bite. There was no hiding this duck. I didn&#39;t love it. It is an acquired taste. And I&#39;ll probably try again, but maybe not at The Melting Pot. The steak I chose had a teriyaki style marinade and sesame seeds. I&#39;m not sure why they bother because once I put the steak in the boiling chicken broth, the seeds fell off and I didn&#39;t taste any of the marinade when the steak made it to my plate. The shrimp were large and delightful. The veggies were plentiful and I was grateful to have a mushroom water at the table so those didn&#39;t go to waste. Note:  the potatoes take about ten minutes, so put those in right away if you want to eat them during your meal. 

Dessert. Ah glorious dessert. Another item that would cause me to visit here again without pause. We had the original which was milk chocolate and peanut butter swirled together to make a fabulously decadent dessert. Add cheesecake bites, brownie bites, fruit chunk, Oreo covered marshmallows and basically you&#39;ve got my heaven on a plate. 

The cost was a little beyond what I anticipated for a chain in the suburbs, so keep that in mind. But if you plan things right and don&#39;t overindulge, this can be an ideal spot to dine."

Had reservations last Saturday for 2 @ 7:45pm to celebrate our 8th Wedding Anniversary. We had requested a table in our online reservations. We arrived at 7:42pm and the hostess stated that we would be checked in and seated. With that regard, we assumed we would be seated shortly. 25 minutes pass and we are still standing there all while 2 open tables are sitting there ready for people to be seated. 

When I ask the hostess what is the issue is, she explains that they are busy and waiting for tables to clear up. I point to the 2 open tables and she turns and faces her computer and start with err, um, oh, well.... Not her fault, she is NOT properly trained.

The manager then comes over and I explain that we have been standing here for 25 minutes for our reservation and NO ONE has said anything to us, and that the two tables are sitting empty. He and 3 other people huddle around the hostess stand computer , they ask my name again , and they all seem disorganized. 

The manager walks back over and states they are busy, just because there are open tables it doesn&#39;t mean we can be seated and then starts to assimilate our not being seated to a doctors office visit and not wanting to have to wait for a doctor in the examination room. Great, you are really going to compare a dining experience to a doctors office visit? That was ridiculous so we walked out and went to another restaurant where everything was top notch and they made us feel they wanted our business 

How about when we checked in the hostess explain that they apologize, but they were running behind, would we like to sit at the bar or be updated as they progress. They could have avoided this whole scene.  PURE AMATUERS!!!"

After she came to from here shock that the Yelp Elite Member hasn&#39;t been to TMP, she informed me that they have a Ladies night deal where you can go for under $20 and try out several courses. Schaumburg&#39;s location offers this deal on Mondays, so we made some plans to visit! We called up my sis and we had a ladies date! See, Melting Pot management...attending the show was worth it! :)

I made some reservations online, per their recommendations, as did my cousin (whoops!) and a few weeks later, I met the girls for dinner and left the hubby at home to eat leftovers. Thanks for taking one for the team, my dear!

We arrived about 6pm to find an empty restaurant, but we didn&#39;t let that bother us. We were there to visit with each other. A major plus was the staff totally catered to us! We got to pick our own table and almost had the feeling we were kinda having our own private party! 

Our server and server trainee where very kind. Obviously, this gentleman had been doing this for a long time as he was very knowledgeable. That, and he was  training, so obviously, he was a seasoned veteran at TMP. The problem I had was that he was &#34;comfortable&#34;. A few tips from me: serve from the left and clear from the right (or vice versa). Unfortunately, there was a LOT of reaching from across the other side of the table. Note: we were seated at a round table in the center of the dining room. Do not hand me my drink; please set it down in front of me. Do not stretch across the table to hand me plates of food, please come around and set it on the table. When you stretch across the table, your dress shirt can easily drag into the food on the table and it did. 

As the night went on, the service began to lack. We had empty glasses more than once. At one point I had to steal my cousin&#39;s water because I needed something to drink, and we had dirty dishes on the table a lot longer than necessary. For a while, we were without any servers on the floor. Everyone seemed to be in the kitchen so we couldn&#39;t even ask anyone to get our server for us. 

About the food: I loved it. I love small bites. The original cheese fondue was EXCELLENT! I enjoyed watching them prepare the fondue right in front of us. That was very cool. I should have skipped the extra protein and stuck with the $19 deal. The additional proteins were just too much food. I wasn&#39;t able to enjoy dessert because I was totally full. 

I think I would like to go try the location in Lombard to see how they roll.  I might be back, it was very yummy. I would just like to see some improvement on service when I return."

However, the service is sooo slow.  I understand a fondue meal can take time, but three hours is a bit much.  We were a large party and due to overbooking they seated us in a booth, very cramped and hot, which unfortunately took away from us enjoying the full experience.  We were all reaching over each other to try the only two pots at the table with way too many sticks cooking in each pot.  Then I would say it was about a 20 minutes or even longer wait in between each part of the meal.  Our server was very, very nice and polite, however he did not do a very good job of explaining the fondue experience; how to order, how to cook items, etc..   Fun and delicious place to eat with a nice and accommodating staff, but they need to improve their speed of service."

You should pick the server Ian if you want a great experience.  It was a little expensive for two people but was worth every penny.  We had the four course meal with cheese, salad, main course, and desert.  They have a contest for free fondue for a year.  If we win I think we would die after 6 months!  Ian was attentive explained the menu well and he was extremely patient while we made our decision. Not only did we have an amazing meal by he made our ordinary date night special with his wonderful personality. So thank you Ian. We will be back!"

I went last night (thursday) and I was not impressed, at all. My date had made a reservation the night before but they said they couldn&#39;t find it. Luckily we got there 20 minutes after they opened and we didn&#39;t have to wait for a table. Our server was not the problem he checked up on us and made corny jokes. He also explained the menu very well for our first time experience. In the first round (the cheese) we were not impressed with how little the portions were and how there was not much variety. Then we got the salad &amp; I&#39;ve honestly never seen a smaller salad in my life. We both ordered the something &#34;fusion&#34; came with lobster tail, poultry and steak. The portions were not that big and our pot wouldn&#39;t come to a boil due to the stove malfunctioning. After a while it started to work. Lastly we got the chocolate and the variety was alright but the strawberries were bad and there was not a lot of fruit for dipping. I expected to be impressed but left disappointed. The bill was very high for such a lousy experience. 
Also the women&#39;s bathroom was very dirty having toilet paper all over the floor."

Linda was our server and she was fantastic. Perhaps the best server I have come across in a long while. We each had a 4 course meal since we wanted to try everything. They gave complementary veggies, fruits and bread that we could refill. 

The food was good and the experience of cooking your food with your friends was exceptionally fun. The ying/yang chocolate fondue was the highlight of the night. We were stuffed before desserts, but were able to clean up the dessert platter simply because it was absolutely delicious!

Linda was very friendly, helpful and SO sweet. She surprised me with a nice birthday treat and lit a candle for me to make my wishes. Before we ended the night, she left me with a small gift. It was such a kind gesture that made the night a memorable one.

Great place to dine in and have an awesome time with friends and family."

I would not recommend coming here if you like to have your food ready ASAP and want to eat and leave right away...but if you want something to do and want to use up time....it would be a good place to come too...I think it took my friends and I around 3 hrs to eat the 4 course meal (Big Night Out) because we had different pots for the cheese, broth/oil, and chocolate...it took a longer time than anticipated to cook the meat and with the cheese and meat cooking.. and then there was the wait time when changing pots...

I think it&#39;s something you can do at home...and possibly get better results with the food..

for the cheese, we ordered spinach artichoke and the cheddar cheese.. they were both good.. but i felt like i could just do this at home with a fondue set...

for the salad, I got house salad (everyone gets to choose their own salad)..it was pretty good....but not amazing or anything...

for the entree, we ordered oil and broth to cook our meat... however, i would just recommend using the broth to cook the meat because the oil is set to such a low heat setting that even if you put the batter on the meat, it comes off and you do not get the same taste that you get when eating any fried foods (ex: tempura...fried potatoes...)....it&#39;ll just cook your meat/veggies.. but the batter will all come off...

for the fondue dessert, we ordered the chocolate that was mixed with caramel and dark chocolate.... I don&#39;t think you can really go wrong with chocolate...so everything tasted good (well to me at least)

pros: fondue dessert was delicious (if I were to come here again.. I would probably come here just to eat dessert with friends..).....atmosphere was good for hanging out with friends....waitress was nice and thorough in explaining everything to us...atmosphere was ok..as it was Monday evening so the restaurant was not busy...

cons: there was wait time when switching pots..and the meat cooked very slowly since it was on low heat (probably due to restaurant liability so that customers don&#39;t get burned from the oil..)....nothing really amazing about the food...if you like to cook.. you can probably just fondue at home..."

Our server David was attentive and knowledge plus he had a good sense of humor which added to our fun evening. A bonus was the manager Steve taking the time out to make sure all patrons were enjoying their dinner/evening. We appreciated his time and added conversation to our evening because he was not only delightful but it showed he truly cared. I was skeptical to come to this location due to the average reviews however both our server David and the new manager Steve, I feel this place not only was deserving of a higher rating but also showed the passion to strive for all patrons to have an above average experience.

You will not leave hungry if you do the four course experience. It&#39;s wonderful for anniversaries. I get the emails, made a reservation online, mentioned it was our anniversary and the promo code to get SIX free chocolate covered strawberries!

I&#39;m glad I did. In the past, I have made my own fondue, so I didn&#39;t know what to expect going out. I was surprised at how full and satisfied I was when I left!

The drinks here are not cheap....at all. I had a beer and that was about it. This is a place where you could definitely drop some money if you wanted to. Luckily when we went it was about $19 for a salad, a choice of cheese, and a choice of chocolate. We had 9 women, and we devoured 2 pots of cheese and 2 pots of chocolate - and we were all stuffed. This stuff goes a long way. So even though it doesn&#39;t look cheap, you will be full when you leave. If you run our if anything, they are happy to bring more. We tried the plain cheddar cheese and the brie &amp; bacon. Both were great - the cheddar gets a little stringy. The chocolate was great too - we got the Ying Yang and Cookies and Cream. Everything was just as good as I thought it would be.

The hostess and waitresses were all very nice and helpful. They came to our table numerous times to make sure we had enough drinks, dippers, and to that we didn&#39;t have any questions. 

I personally wouldn&#39;t get an entree - you don&#39;t need it. It&#39;s just an extra expense and meat/oil. It&#39;s fun, (I&#39;ve done it at home), but if you&#39;re looking to save money this is something you could cut out. This sort of thing is a treat for me.

Our waitress was friendly and explained everything really well. When my friend and I began craving other things to dip, our waitress actually informed us of all the other options available (including some of our cravings!). She was kind enough to bring bowls of broccoli and all sorts of other stuff. That was super cool. A lot of other waiters probably wouldn&#39;t have done that.

After we dipped everything possible but our chairs, we were offered the dessert pot ... LOL. Yeah, when I get a second stomach!

The food service concept is different and fun for your first time but it&#39;s not something I would do again. Its also pretty expensive. The service wasn&#39;t bad but was slow at times. When it&#39;s your first time the server spends sometime with you to explain how the fondue  thing works and to set up the appetizers and other courses. I think my group and I were there for 3 hours for a 4 course meal. It takes a while to set up the courses and to wait for your meal to cook. You cook the meats for the main course yourself. 

We did 2 cheese appetizers, the loaded potatoes and spinach/ artichoke dip which was the best part of the meal in my opinion. Then we had a salad which was pretty standard salad. Then you choose your main entree which is raw meat (chicken, shrimp, lobster, steak, port etc.) that you cook in broth or oil at the table. You also get many different dipping sauces for the meat. By the 3rd course we were very full but made some room for the dessert. You get to choose what dipping sauce you want. We picked white chocolate/dark chocolate mix that you dip fruit, marshmallows or cake into. 

If I did go again I would only do the appetizer and dessert. The main entree is not worth the price."

We&#39;ve been there four different times, and have always experienced awesome service, very tasty food, and some of the most delicious cocktails that I&#39;ve ever had! 

We usually always start with salads (very good! You can actually purchase their salad dressing) we always order cheese, which is prepared right in front of you, using all very fresh ingredients and spices. They serve you with a good size platter of veggies, bread and chips.. To dip in the sauce. I promise.. Even if you dislike cheese, you will love this! 

We&#39;ve only ordered an actual dinner platter, twice. We usually were stuffed after salads and cheese. Of course wanting and making sure that we had room for dessert. Which of course, I will tell you all about dessert. :) 

The dinners are pretty darn good! However, the times we went.. they made us order two! They were not allowing us to share, which I thought was pretty crappy! It&#39;s darn near impossible to take home a doggie bag! They should considering allowing people up share.. after all.. you would make and sell way more! They may have changed it in the last month, but I doubt it! 
Clearly if it&#39;s a preplanned event that has been organized by the restaurant, let guest share! 
The dinners we have had.. are super good! Fresh and very filling! 

Dessert.. where shall I start?! You are given a huge plate full of fruits, cake, pretzels and other goodies... Can we say, yummy!! We honestly are always unable to finish the pot of chocolate. Heck, we have a hard time finishing any of their pots! All portions are very large, which is not a bad thing. 

Service has always been outstanding. Our first time there we had one awesome waitress! She was very good about coming over, making sure we understood how everything worked, and that we were OK and that the food was as awesome as we had hoped, which it was! 

They have some of the best darn drinks that I&#39;ve ever had. They offer a very wide variety of wines, beers and mixed drinks. However, the drinks are slightly on the pricey side, still worth it. 

Overall, the place is awesome! 
It is something you can make at home, but it&#39;s nice to be waited on, and just enjoy yourself. 

I highly recommend making reservations a week or two in advance if you plan to go on a weekend. They tend to book up quickly."

The only downside is the price.  $100 for 2 people (water to drink) is insanity. I can probably eat for the entire month on that. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re getting a gourmet meal either.

The atmosphere here is romantic and I especially enjoy the booths here because they give you some extra privacy. The service here has also always been great. The cheese fondue is also excellent.  I really enjoy the beer cheese one :) While I find the meats to be good I don&#39;t feel like they are worth the price charged. Many places in the area have better cuts. The dessert fondue however is excellent and a must have. I also miss the beer and wine flights. They had them on the menu for a short time and they were great. Paired perfectly with each course.

It too forever to get drinks and for most of the dinner we were without drinks.  He rarely checked on is and the service was really slow even though it was not that busy.

I was not  aware until I arrived that Sunday was family night were free dinner is offered for children 12 and under.  I asked not to be placed near any young children and about 10 minutes into dinner they say a table 2 tables over with 3 kids including a baby that screamed most of the dinner. The drinks were terrible as well.  We orders the cherry drink, which I have order at other locations and was great-however at this location is tasted like cherry cough syrup.

The food was fresh, the veggies and fruits were abundant, the &#34;big night out&#34; salad was tasty (I had the spinach) and the cooking styles were tasty. 

Bottom line, if you&#39;ve never had fondue and have nice company and a few hours to kill, check it out."

It was two salads and two entries. We upgraded to get a cheese and dessert as well which was honestly the highlight of the meal. I should add that I&#39;ve NEVER had fondue before. The cheese was good, I&#39;m not a big fan of wine so that did kinnda mess with  the flavor for me. I liked that the waiter makes it table side for you, by putting the cheese and other stuff into your pot to melt. We got the classic alpine so maybe the swiss made it a bit bitter? Not sure still ate it. It was pretty empty for a sunday which I thought was odd? Most people I know go out on sundays. The waiter was nice, very informative and professional. Def sounded like he&#39;d worked there for a while. Now the meat course...this is where it fell apart for me. I didn&#39;t realize that basically your eating boiled meat. :x blech. I got the beef fillet mignon which should be like the best cut of meat right? Ehh I ate one piece and then the boyfriend ended up having to eat my portion. He got the pot stickers and shrimp which he was was good. But man the beef was gross. Just like...flavorless?? Would DEF never do the main course again especially since it was like 25 bucks a serving. Now the saving GRACE was dessert! We got the ying and yang chocolate dessert and it was AWESOME. Best thing I ate all day :) I think I will come back for dessert and cheese. But be prepared to drop some money! Before the groupon was applied the bill was around 110 bucks!! After the groupon it was still around like 40 something. Now the ONE thing that REALLY annoyed me was there was a waiter talking to another waiter behind our booth about how he&#39;s gotten stiffed on a check (only got a dollar on a 90 dollar bill). He was stomping around complaining to himself and obviously pissed. I think this shouldn&#39;t be done clearly in view of customers. I would assume if that table used a groupon like we did, their bill probably was only 10 bucks after groupon...meh dont know we still tipped well but I think people tip crappy because they&#39;ve already spent 40 bucks on basically a coupon.

Oh and on a side note, they put us in this dark corner that was freeeezing. I&#39;m sure they thought me and the boyfriend wanted a romantic dinner at 2pm but come on. There was plenty of well lit areas by the windows that was open. By the end of the dinner I was warming my hands on the fondue pot!!!

Also I&#39;m seeing people got cheesecake with their dessert fondue. We did not get that on our plate. Which now that I think about it makes me upset if they forgot to give it to me if I paid for it."

The hostest and the owner looked at our family up and down and took a couple of minutes even to say hello. We asked for a table of four and the hostest said we would have too wait, even thought it was a wednesday night. The place was not packed at all, there was clearly a whole section of tables. When we finally got seated we noticed that there was a total of three other tables in our section, in short...They were not busy, they could of seated us quickly. The issue? Our race.

We were with our black father and white mother, and me and my sister are mixed race. When we sat down the owner very rudely explained that it was a fancy place and that my father could not wear his hat. The table next to us, had a couple where the man had a hat on. He did not ask him to take it off, as they were already on their entree. They asked him to take if off because of his race, this goes back to discrimination. 

All and all we felt discriminated against and worst of all it was on my 17th birthday."

We decided to go all-out with the four course dinner, starting with a tasty caesar salad.  After that we had the spinach-artichoke cheese fondue which I could have eaten all day, and on the other end of the table was the cheddar dip, which tasted too much like alcohol to me.  For the entree I had &#34;The Classic&#34; with everything from shrimp to steak bits, cooked in the Coq Au Vin which was very good with the proteins.  For desert we had the &#34;Flaming Turtle&#34; flambe which was also very delicious.  

The Good:  -Service was very good and attentive for the two-hour venture we had (Thank you Omar!)
                     -It was my second visit after a ten-year gap, and the menu has certainly    gotten much better and expansive.  
                     -Delicious cheese dip, entree and desert!

The Bad:  -Man am I glad that I was treated to this dinner!  It was around $50 per person so make sure that when you come it is for a very special occassion.
                   -Make sure you are familiar with fondue before you eat here"

All the different varieties of salads and fondue is great. The server was amazing she helped out the table with everything since it was our first time coming here. 
Although it was a great food experience we won&#39;t be coming back here at all anymore. I mistakenly forgot a piece of clothing there and called right away to see if it was still at the restaurant, it was thank goodness. One manager told me he will hold on to it till I go back and pick it up. But when I went to pick them up they seemed to have disappeared and there was was nothing they could do for getting back my property they said they would hold on to.
Overall great food and atmosphere. Just if you go make sure you don&#39;t forget anything. It may be the last time you see it."

There were 8 of us, and luckily there weren&#39;t any more, because I don&#39;t think anyone else would have fit at our table!  We shared 2 burners with the pots for fondue, and it was about the perfect amount of food.  We all did different versions of the 4-course dinner, and it worked out very well.  Our waiter, TJ, was very attentive, and did a great job of explaining the menu and offering suggestions for us.  

I thought the Swiss cheese fondue was absolutely amazing, and it was a substantial amount of food to dip in it (bread, broccoli, cauliflower, and apples).  I then had the Spinach and Mushroom salad, which was surprisingly good.  The &#34;warm&#34; salad dressing it was served with had me concerned, but it was delicious!  For the main course, I chose the Vegetarian plate, even though they were out of the onion rings described in the menu.  My friend next to me chose the Land and Sea, and the two of us shared the variety of items on our plates.  Everything was very good, with the exception of the chicken, which was just okay; not very flavorful.  The veggies in the Coq au Vin fondue were very good.  For the last course, we had everyone&#39;s favorite: chocolate!  We decided on the Flaming Turtle and the Dark Chocolate, both of which were amazing.  Multiple plates of strawberries, bananas, rice krispie treats, brownie bites, cheesecake, and marshmallows were served, and each bite was more delicious than the last (although the strawberries were hands down my fave)!

This is definitely a great place to go if you&#39;re looking for something a bit different, or if you&#39;ve got a big group of people.

One tip I would like to share: if going here in the winter, when it is exceptionally cold outside (as it was tonight), do NOT sit near windows.  They are very drafty, and despite the warm burners in front of us, we were freezing the entire time!"

We waited for every one of our courses.  No staff at bar area, and when someone finally did show up, they provided no receipt and overcharge us for a Lite beer and a house Chardonnay.  Claim they have a dress-code, but then seated a woman in a Blackhawks T-shirt &amp; jeans.  Expensive with our meal costing $280+ for a party of four.  Lastly, reached out with my concerns to both the restaurant and corporate office and never received a response.  There are better restaurants in the Schaumburg area."

The lobster tail was awful, the fondue liquid was bland, and the dessert was dry and disappointing. 

Our server was nice but not terribly effective with empty glasses lingering unfilled and crowding the tiny table. Service took just under four hours total, despite being told to expect two. This was due to long waits between courses 

The dining area is crowded, the tables are small and the acoustics are horrible. Conversing was painful all night due to the loud music and background noise."

We had an awesome time! We got the fiesta appetizer and it was really tasty with a spicy kick which we loved. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the spinach mushroom salad, but I didn&#39;t come there for the salad so didn&#39;t mind. I got the seafood trio and he got the land and sea entree and we both were satisfied. I do sort of wish the menus were like before with the option to have a bit shared entree but it was still good. For dessert we got the s&#39;mores chocolate fondue and it was really yummy! The chocolate was perfect and the dippers were fantastic, the only thing is I would have rather had the graham crackers on the side instead of in the chocolate. 
Ladies if you&#39;re looking for a good cocktail there get the meltini! Both times I&#39;ve been here I got two meltinis and they are amazing! Service was good too, we were with Natalie and she was very nice and attentive. Overall great experience."

I had very enjoyable dining experiences at the melting pot. It&#39;s not a quick sit down dinner so you&#39;ll have to make some extra time for this type of meal but it&#39;s definitely worth it. Same with the prices-I&#39;m sure they&#39;re above average-but you get what you pay for. 

I&#39;ve never had a waiter/waitress that wasn&#39;t able to knowledgeably explain how the dining experience worked, or give food suggestions/recommendations, etc. So maybe I just lucked out there..since some other reviewers seemed to have an issue with that..that being said, I&#39;d highly suggest those reviewers go back..I find it hard to give a place a bad review based on one server, one time. 

I would suggest looking up the menu online to get an idea before you go. There are so many different options of cheese and sauces to dip/cook whatever you choose..fruits, veggies, bread, different meats..They have such a wide variety. I almost forgot the dessert options..different types of chocolate fondue - to dip your choice of strawberries, bananas, pound cake, cheesecake, and more! (can&#39;t remember them all.) SO delicious! 

I&#39;ve only dined here during the week so the atmosphere was nice &amp; quiet. They have big, comfy booths which is great if you want a little privacy."

Appearances wise there is nothing exceptional. Its a standard order at counter, seat yourself and pick food when ready kind of set up. Food wise what I love is the fact that you can build your own dish - choose  pasta, choose sauce, choose veggie / meat add ons. 

We asked for Spinach Tortellini in Pink Sauce with Brocolli &amp; Pine Nuts. We also ordered a portion of Fettucine in Alfredo Sauce with Mushrooms, Spinach &amp; Chicken. 

The tortellini itself was nicely cooked. The Pink Sauce a perfect balance of white &amp; red sauces giving you the taste of creaminess as well as a hint of sour from the tomatoes. The Fettucine Alfredo is some of the best I&#39;ve had, top notch restaurants included. I have always loved the combination of cream &amp; butter on my pasta (guilt!) The white meat chicken cooked through &amp; through with the Alfredo flavors only made my eating experience that much more enjoyable. We had also ordered a side of garlic bread, standard bread nothing exceptional taste wise.

Pastabilities is such a great example that great food need not necessarily be in a fancy set up. Go ahead, explore this possibility!"

Frankly the decor leaves a lot to be desired and maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;ve never ventured in.  However, looking for a quick meal last night, I decided to give them a try for carryout.  I ordered a gluten-free pasta with oil and garlic and added chicken, an eggplant parmesan, and a kid&#39;s ravioli with pesto.

For a place called Pastabilities, I was expecting better quality pasta and sauces.  The gluten-free pasta is now changed to rigatoni instead of spaghetti (which was fine), but the texture was just okay and it had virtually no flavor.  We had to basically drown the pasta with cheese to make it edible.  It was a similar experience with the kid&#39;s ravioli.  It was several dollars to upgrade to the pesto sauce, and I&#39;ve had better pesto purchased from Sam&#39;s Club in a jar.

Wait - so why am I giving a 4-star rating if everything was meh?  The eggplant parmesan.  It&#39;s REALLY good.  It&#39;s not cheap at $8.99 which comes basically a la carte other than with a piece of french bread.  But it&#39;s not just a piece of eggplant with sauce.  They make it into a layered casserole masterpiece with plenty of cheese and sauce.  Texture is spot on, flavor is great, everything about this dish is perfect.  There&#39;s also no breadcrumbs for those looking to do low-carb or gluten-free.

I think this place is somewhere between 2-3 stars for pasta alone.  But then they get 4-5 stars for the eggplant parmesan.  We&#39;ll average out to a 4 star overall."

You can make your own pasta and choose whatever toppings or pick from the selections. Their &#34;pink sauce&#34; is amazing which is a marinara and Alfredo mixed sauce. My personal favorite is bow-tie pasta with pesto sauce, mushrooms, chicken, and spinach. Their garlic bread is hands down thee best I have ever had!! They give you a good amount of food along with bread. A bit pricey if you add toppings but nonetheless definitely worth it!"

Both were just about as good as we have experienced. Lovely marinara. Nice pasta. The grilled chicken was perfecto. The bow tie pasta with chicken, mushrooms and parmesan was amazing. The only weak spot was the minestrone. Fresh as could be, but lacking herbs and distinction. Prices cannot be beat. These people are nice!"

I had read numerous extremely favorable reviews on Pastabilities but when I pulled into the shopping plaza and saw it was a vanilla looking store front eatery I had serious doubts about all those reviews.  I almost turned around.
Wow!  What a find.  Best in class!  This is my first review ever... mainly because the quality was off the charts so I feel compelled to share this culinary experience with others so they can enjoy this gem.
The minestrone soup was made from scratch and was delicious and generous in serving size.  I also had the mostaccioli with red sauce and meatballs. It was to die for!  If you love Italian food they will make your favorite dish just the way you want it!
Definitely will be returning.

It&#39;s got super-tasty quick Italian food. A local &#34;fast-food&#34; Italian place, if you will.

Personal fave: bowtie pasta with the Marfredo sauce (Alfredo/Marinara mix) with sausage cut into it. *MUAH*. I actually occasionally crave this dish. And the super cool thing is that I can call ahead, and it&#39;s ready in 10 minutes!

I think their food is quite tasty. The only think I&#39;ve come across that I didn&#39;t care for is the &#34;generic&#34; pasta..which is pretty boring in my opinion - for example the pasta that comes with the chicken parmesan. The chicken is really good, but for that price I want both the chicken and the pasta to be equally mouthwatering.

Overall - a really great option for GOOD &#34;fast-food&#34;.

Pros: Great food
Cons: a little pricey for what it is,"

Garlic and oil is well done, and marana and meat sauces are home made, with a fresh tomatoey zest. Try adding some hot peppers to make it hot n spicy for a small upcharge. Meatballs are tender and big enough to fill you up and the chicken parm is on point. Each meal comes with some Italian bread on the side and comes in at 6-8$ a fair price. Service is quick as well. 

On a sour note, pastabilities has shrunk their portions as of recent times to keep up with food costs. You get less noodles and less veggies in your pasta. Rather than shrink portions, they should cut out the bread. Carbs on carbs?

Still, the prices are just fine for the quality of the sauces and meats. I love eating Italian without the sit down table service and its not corporate so you want these folks to do well. I will be back soon!"

I usually get the gnocchi with marfredo sauce or the mostaccoili with meat sauce and mozzerella.

Because now we have visited them a couple times for dinners, tried a variety of their amazing baked treats AND we&#39;ve gone there for breakfast.  All of it has been top-notch delicious with friendly service! And truly the prices on their baked goods are fantastic...considering they are all made from scratch &amp; you would pay double the price at Mariano&#39;s or another bakery for comparable items (but the goodies from Olde Salem Cafe taste WAY better than anything you get from Mariano&#39;s).   Here is my original review:
****************
Wow!! I cannot believe I have been missing out on enjoying their delicious meals, sandwiches &amp; desserts for all this time! Do not let the rather sad looking strip mall they are tucked into fool you...inside is some wonderfully delicious food served and prepared by some really nice folks.    Thank you to the Yelp weekly Oktoberfest-themed newsletter for bringing this hidden gem to my attention!

On our first visit I had the Rouladen with roasted potatoes &amp; the Hubs got the Hunter&#39;s Schnitzel with spaetzel (minimal upcharge for spaetzel &amp; it was worth it though the roasted potatoes were delicious as well).  Both meals came with homemade rolls &amp; butter and a plate with 3 kinds of vinegar-based German salads (carrot, cucumber &amp; tomato - all very good).  We both took enough leftovers home for one more meal and in the case of the Schnitzel even 2 more meals so the portions are generous.  They have a good amount of sandwiches and appetizers to choose from in addition to the meals so I cannot wait to come back and devour my way through all their offerings.  They also serve breakfast on Saturdays &amp; Sundays and I&#39;ve head good things about that, too, so I pretty much just need to camp out in their parking lot for a couple of weeks...

I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention their mouth-watering selection of baked goods &amp; desserts as well.  It&#39;s all from scratch and we had a hard time deciding from the display case...they don&#39;t have signs but our server (not sure if she is the owner as well? - but she was so friendly &amp; helpful!) explained what each one in the case was.  Since we couldn&#39;t decide we took home 4 different slices of cake/dessert to enjoy over the weekend and we were not disappointed!  Everything we tried was so moist &amp; tasty and even the 2 slices we had the next night were still perfectly moist &amp; delicious.  I honestly don&#39;t remember the names of the desserts we tried but I don&#39;t think it matters what you get - it will be YUM-O!  Whenever we want to just pick up some dessert I will definitely go here instead of going to the market.

The service was friendly and helpful but not obtrusive...she gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and answered any questions we had.  Our water glasses &amp; software drinks were promptly refilled when needed without having to ask and the main course food came out about 15 minutes after we placed our order."

The food here is delicious!! Homemade German food!

HOMEMADE in case you missed it! We went when the restaurant opened for breakfast and we ordered a few different plates. First plate was Eggs bacon and potatoes that are very well seasoned. Next was French Toast and let me tell you The French Toast is AMAZING!! Its made with homemade German bread its was lite and fluffy and ooo soo good!  Then we got a order of Apple Pancakes and just wow!! Your taste buds won&#39;t know what hit them. The location has just been expanded and remodeled and when you walk in everyone is so nice and friendly and inviting!! 

I would definitely recommend this location! Great food decent prices and good portions!"

My boyfriend also got a tarimisu to go and he loved it as well. The desserts were so beautifully presented.

I cannot wait to go back and order more food. Hopefully one day, I can stop by for breakfast! I recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something tasty. They also have gluten free items!"

The decorations were absolutely awful the stars and hearts on them looked like blobs and you couldn&#39;t even recognize the letters. They charged me $85 for 110 small cookies but in reality with the awful decoration those cookies look like they were worth $20. I was so discouraged with these cookies I literally had to redecorate all 110 because ALL 110 COOKIES LOOKED AWFUL."

I think it was the Schaumburg one. Anyhow, I had the most wonderful brownies that day they had prepared and I knew I would have to visit their storefront soon. 

I was in the area looking for a quick bite to eat when I remembered they were nearby. I turned right where I thought they were and I was exactly right. They are located in a small strip mall directly across the street from Long John Silver&#39;s. This is one of those &#34;don&#39;t judge a book by its cover&#34; places. Literally. The window coverings are kinda haphazard and it looked dark inside, but the open sign was lit up and so I wandered in.  

While it was dark inside and a little chilly, it definitely smelled fantastic!!  And I was greeted by the sweetest lady. It took me a while to decide and while I was working through my options, she took multiple phone orders. Looks like they do a great carryout business for lunch! Then a couple came in to take a look. I quickly learned they had been here before and knew exactly what they wanted. There is a self serve refrigerated case in the front filled with brownies, tarts, homemade banana bread, zucchini bread, blueberry bread, streusel, cookies and beyond!  They unloaded a bunch of items on the counter, paid and quickly took their sweet goodies to go. 

It was decision time. They make their own pretzel rolls. I absolutely had to try one. So I had a grilled chicken sandwich on a pretzel roll with fresh cut French fries. I also took home a yogurt fruit tart and a mini zucchini bread. Let&#39;s break it down:

The pretzel roll was actually shaped like a pretzel which was cute. But more importantly was how fresh, soft and tasty it was. This was a five star item!

The grilled chicken was a little but like a chargrilled chicken and a bit too charred in some areas for me. But it was seasoned and juicy in the center, so it was still pretty good. 

The fresh cut fries were lightly salted, hot and greasy. Aren&#39;t these the perfect adjectives for fresh cut fries?

The yogurt tart was suggested by the sweet woman working there.  I think it&#39;s about five layers. A cookie layer, a thin layer of something like jam, a layer of sponge cake, the thick layer of yogurt that didn&#39;t really taste just like yogurt but rather had a deeper thing going on there and a top layer kinda like jello but not. And the fruit. This was rich and creamy and awesome. Truly a five star item for me as well. 

I cannot comment on the mini zucchini bread yet because I haven&#39;t dived in and it&#39;s hibernating in my fridge at the moment. But it looks awesome and if it&#39;s anything like the rest of the food, I&#39;m guessing it will be another home run!

Without a doubt, I will be stopping by again soon to try some more of their tasty treats and savory menu items."

The food is like being invited to your German grandmother&#39;s house for dinner ... your grandmother who lives in Bavaria, that is. It is totally authentic, totally home-made, and totally delicious. They have a small but full menu, covering breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner, all excellent southern German dishes. The Spätzle [home-style noodles with butter, salt &amp; pepper] costs extra, and it should - it&#39;s among the best I&#39;ve ever had, anywhere. The baked goods are outstanding, too, as you might expect from a business that is also a bakery. Each item is hand-crafted, so the service can be a little slow, especially when there are a lot of customers. This place is hard to find; I would have never found it without Yelp&#39;s help, and even then it was a bit confusing. The outside is a plain storefront in a nondescript strip mall called &#39;Olde Salem&#39; - hence the not-particularly-German name. The business isn&#39;t really a &#39;Cafe,&#39; either (although they have great coffee), it combines a retail bakery and a small sit-down restaurant. Ausgezeichnet!"

So, I went into this restaurant expecting to have a bad time. It&#39;s in Woodfield. The previous best restaurant on the roster was the @#$%ing Cheesecake Factory. So when it was good, rather than bad or only OK, I was pleasantly surprised.

What&#39;s good? Well, BBQ is a good place to start! Beer list is also spot on. I had a pulled-pork style thing, ordered spicy, and it actually came out spicy! Imagine my astonishment, spicy food in the burbs that I didn&#39;t have a Spanish name.

We stopped in on a semi busy Saturday night after the late rush. 

First the food: 4-5 stars for the food. Chicken was up there with the best of them. Whisky BBQ sauce is addicting. Sweet hearty and smoky. Excellent. 

Service: 1 star. Man I hate to put this in a review since I like to focus on food but this was bad. Got there at 8:45 ordered a drink that didn&#39;t come until 9:10. Then we heard the food didn&#39;t get fired up. We had to ask because a nearby table came after us, ordered and was already eating. 

Then we are told that the fish was burned so they decided to redo that. That&#39;s cool but then they had the nerve to ask us if we wanted desert after a dinner that took an hour and a half? It was almost closing time. 

My wife is the stickler and it takes a lot to get her going. She was pretty mad that we didn&#39;t get an apology from a manager (we are not the types to hunt a manager down) and we weren&#39;t offered a discount or anything for the ridiculous time it took to eat. 

My advice. Go to Real Urban BBQ. the food is close to the same and since it is served cafeteria style you don&#39;t have to wait for silly service like we received. It&#39;s BBQ folks. The stuff is smoked and ready to go. Should never take that long!!!

I ordered the brisket sandwich and also got a free appetizer from checking in through Yelp. The hush puppies were amazing. So soft and chewy and warm taste was just really good. 

The brisket was amazing it was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. It came with whiskey BBQ sauce and boy oh boy I couldn&#39;t get enough of that sauce.

Came with a side of skin cut French fries that were crunchy and super addicting with their house whiskey sauce. 

Check in to Yelp for a complimentary appetizer of the hushpuppies. Crunchy grilled jalapeños mixed with cheddar cheese make for a dangerously appetizing combination.  Pairs well with their house kinfork IPA beer on special this month for $4 dollars.

kinfork-bbq-and-tap-schaumburg,Jamie M.,vz4eJpx3VpIoqC0VobaRDA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,80,1848,nOO2yB-T_Sl4yQFHXcf6Tw,3.0,2016-06-06,"Despite the promising Southern-inspired menu, most of their offerings lacked one key component - flavor. 

Call it the &#34;Curse of the &#39;Burbs&#34;, but just a dash of salt, a smattering of seasonings during the preparation, or even some fresh herbs would have elevated this food from mediocre to above average - and when you factor in their remarkable price-points and portion sizes, there&#39;s potential for success, even in a mall.

Since we were visiting from downtown Chicago, I had to do a double take when I saw the craft cocktail list - single digit prices. Yes. Hard to believe! The Moonshine Electric Lemonade was refreshing and potent, while my old reliable - the simple Old Fashioned- was perfectly built around a stiff pour of Forester&#39;s Bourbon.

On to the menu items: Down in the South, where I was raised, &#34;Hush Puppies&#34; (two words) are comfortable shoes. But &#34;hushpuppies&#34;, the Southern fish-fry staple, are small, deep-fried balls of corn meal, white flour and buttermilk, typically flavored with onion powder or maybe a little finely grated raw onion. Kinfork&#39;s appetizer version of &#34;hush puppies&#34; ($7) are ultra-light, perfectly fried balls of a sweet, cake-like batter, dotted with pieces of roasted corn, diced jalapeno and cheddar cheese - but despite the additions, the little golf ball-sized blister of air were woefully lacking in flavor. Moreover, the peach crème fraiche &#34;dipping sauce&#34; tasted like a melted Creamsicle popsicle. Folks, the only thing that should be served with savory hushpuppies is honey butter. 
 
Keeping with the Southern theme, I ordered the Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich - a massive (ENORMOUS!) tennis ball portion of shredded pork, piled on top of a toasted sweet&#39;ish bun and topped with a watery - again, bland- coleslaw and semi-fried onion strings. The pork itself was so saturated in their &#34;Red Vinegar Carolina Sauce&#34;, the bun disintegrated when I picked it up, and the tomato-y sauce masked what little subtle smokiness the meat had captured.

---FYI: The Great State of North Carolina is the only state with two distinctive styles of barbecue (and, yes, &#34;barbecue&#34; is a noun, not a verb, for some of us). Eastern style is typically whole hog barbecue, smoked over hardwood and mopped with a tangy apple cider vinegar, brown sugar and pepper sauce. And then there is Western style, which is pure evil. (Just kidding!) Actually, Western is almost the same as Eastern style, but they add a heavy dose of ketchup to their sauce (Sacrilege!), and instead of cooking a whole hog, they usually cook pork butts or shoulders, sometimes over wood, sometimes over charcoal.---

Kinfolk&#39;s attempt to blend the flavors of Eastern and Western North Carolina falls flat - there&#39;s simply too much ketchup in their sauce, and the heavy sugar and/or corn syrup ratio leaves a greasy coating on the pork that stifles the smoky goodness. The reason you use cider vinegar as the sauce&#39;s base is to &#34;cut the fat&#34; on the pork, for better mouth feel. Unfortunately, their sugary mopping sauce is just too sweet to allow the tanginess and smattering of heat to shine. 

The wife&#39;s Meatloaf Plate ($15) was a mammoth portion of three flat-top grilled slices of uber-tender meat planks. Again, a tiny bit of salt and pepper perked up the flavor. The mashed potatoes were tepid and tasteless, except for the oleo-like liquid pooled on the top, and the two tree-like branches of broccolini were so bitter they were almost inedible. (Maybe a little more blanching before tossing them on the plate?)

We&#39;ll certainly give them another try, with hopes they are still dialing in the recipes on their expansive menu. And while portion sizes are ginormous, the price points on all their offerings are spot-on. Service was excellent from our waiter, Chris, and we&#39;ll offer a big thumb&#39;s up to Justin, who steered us towards the restaurant while he was working the crowd in the mall on a busy Saturday night."

Actually it&#39;s right in Woodfield Mall. The good in that is of course a tasty option when shopping. The annoying in that is if you&#39;re not at the mall, finding and parking here as a destination dining spot!

When my friend and I went, Kinfork had just opened. We had some delicious food items but service had some big kinks that needed to be worked out (slow, overcharged on items/sides, not knowing the menu just yet). I&#39;m hopeful all of these issues have now been ironed out because the food was quite tasty.

Grilled chicken portabello sandwich? Tasty and semi-healthy. I would prefer a slightly less hard bread, but hey! That&#39;s just me.
Tater tots? Really delicious! 
Mac &amp; Cheese? Rich and creamy - liked it quite a bit!

All in all, Kinfork is a great addition to Woodfield &amp; the Schaumburg area. I&#39;m hoping for slightly improved service but that their food stays on point!"

    For an appetizer we ordered the KF nachos with pulled pork.  They were delicious, and the jalapeños were very spicy.  For dinner, we got the Carolina pulled pork sandwich and the turkey panini.  Both were great, but the pulled pork is the real star at Kinfork.  I would definitely recommend you visit Kinfork, and I would definitely encourage you to try the BBQ!"

Being a statistics nut, I know there can only be so many on either end of the spectrum. Still, I love writing 4 and 5 star reviews more than lesser ones.

Kinfork seems to be a restaurant that doesn&#39;t know who they are.We chose to go there after receiving an invitation for their new tasting barbeque menu. They put up a large smoker on the sidewalk outside of entrance 1 at Woodfield Mall as a draw. The manager said they want it to be functional but are having trouble getting approval. (Who would think there would be an issue when there is a large, several hundred degree iron statue that kids walk by at a mall. No touching?

The tasting was not well prepared. We arrived a little after 5pm, right on time, and they were not prepared yet. Several other patrons also had tickets and were also waiting. The hostess explained that this was a simple tasting, outside of the restaurant by the non-functional smoker. After waiting a few minutes, we opted to go inside and order from the menu.

First, the service was disappointing. It seemed there were plenty of people working there, but many of them were standing around talking with each other. The waiter suggested one of their moonshine drinks. I asked what moonshine meant in Chicago. In summary, it is not what you would expect to come out of a still. The drinks are served fruity and sweet, just not my bag. I got a Pepsi (no Coke).

For dinner, my wife had pulled pork and I had the brisket. The menu clearly states that some like sauce and others don&#39;t so the waiter will ask how you want it. He didn&#39;t ask, and we did not think to tell him.

The food was served relatively quickly. I tried some of the pork. It was tender, juicy and loaded with barbeque sauce. As for my dinner, the brisket comes with four narrowly sliced pieces smothered in sauce. While the meat tasted okay, I wonder how much of the flavor was covered by the sauce. My meal also came with two sides. First, the baked beans were disappointing - it was bland and was more like bean soup (pintos and kidneys). There was a 1-inch cube of pork belly in the center of the bowl. 

I also had their roasted root vegetables. The yams were good. The carrots were just okay. The onions were inedible. There were other veggies in the mix I could not identify. I&#39;d kind of like to know so I stay away from them in the future.

We said something to the server to bring as a suggestion to the kitchen. After that the manager came over to check on us, asking what we didn&#39;t care for and why. He did seem genuinely concerned. However, with every comment, his answer tended toward &#34;we strive to be different and alter recipes so they have unique tastes. He offered us free desserts which we thanked him for, but said no. We didn&#39;t want free food. We did want them to know that they had some work to do to keep our business."

Although described as a barbecue restaurant, it is more akin to gourmet home cooking. The food is absolutely amazing, and speaking from experience, guaranteed to bring you back to explore their menu even further. They have a great bar as well, sporting moonshine cocktails that are as delicious as they affordable. The restaurant is staffed by very welcoming and considerate people, and are an absolute delight to talk to.

Starter was nachos with pulled pork and their nachos are possibly the best I ever had. The crispness of the tortilla chips, the meat, cheese and jalapeños made a 5 star combination. My wife is not a big nacho fan and she scraped the platter clean. We had their hush puppies out first visit, and they are good, but the nachos are big so you can split a meal with those.

Our first visit we had the pulled pork and it was OK, this time we got the brisket handheld and they gave us some honey, whiskey bbq sauce on the side. The coleslaw on the sandwich was really good and the sauce put it up to an easy 4 star meal. Paired with the tater tots and it was very good.

The management stopped by any they apologized for our first visit being poor; they made it worth it for us to come back for visit 2 and there will be a visit 3. They are upgrading the smoker, they have a new chef who is creative and I am looking forward to the next visit."

Hubby and I split the nachos appetizer and also split the brisket handheld with whisky BBQ sauce on the side and tots. Both dishes were lick-the-plate good!  The nachos now come with choice of pork or brisket (used to come with pot roast).
Hint *order bbq sauce with the brisket handheld. The coleslaw is delicious but the bread would have made the sandwich too dry w/o the sauce to add to it. 
Their nachos are $12, but big enough for a meal, or to share with several other friends. These nachos are so crunchy with just enough melted cheese throughout and sour cream and jalapeños all on top. Mmm!!!  I practically licked the skillet clean. 
Menu is updating 7/3/16. So a few things were different than what we saw in the menu. Actually we had a better meal because of this!
Sylvia is a very kind and attentive server. Not too hovering but refilled our drinks as needed without us waiting. Always a good trait. 
Corey, manager on duty, took great care of us and we are very thankful for his kindness to us!
Definitely gotta come back and try more of the menu to see if it&#39;s all this good. Also, we didn&#39;t leave any room for dessert. Will come again for their s&#39;more skillet from the dessert menu!!!"

So we went to Woodfield.  The wait was 25 minutes or we could sit at the bar and eat.  Nah!  So we left Red Robin and saw a sign for Kinfork.  We never heard of it so we figured we&#39;d try something new. 

The place looked fairly empty but still there was a 10 minute wait. Maybe it was because of the party in the back room and they were staggering the customers to keep the cooks from being overworked.  Whatever.

My first impression was I didn&#39;t get a feel for the restaurant like it was cool or had a great theme or a certain energy to it.  It seemed odd that the waiting area was so big.  Considering the price they are probably paying to be in Woodfield you think they&#39;d try to maximize the floor space to get the most tables.  In the lobby there are lighted cases with moonshine, and somehow they works into a rustic camping theme?

Anyhow, we got our table and after looking through the menu we started to wonder if we had a server assigned to our table.  Then I guy who looked like David Blaine (the magician) came rushing past the table and said hi as he passed.  I thought he was going to be our server, but then I thought maybe he was just being friendly.  He ended up being our server.

If you&#39;ve read my reviews on fat in meat, you know I like pulled pork but it&#39;s hard to find sandwiches where they&#39;ve trimmed the fat before they serve it.  That wasn&#39;t the case with this place. We had to trim off the fat.  Fortunately, I wasn&#39;t the one who ordered the pork, I went with the safe choice and ordered the burger. Because it was only a 5lb burger, I ordered the double.  A single would have been enough!

Our food came quickly and the burger was done perfectly.  The meat was right-off-the-grill hot and tasted like it was cooked on a barbeque grill.  This sandwich is why I gave this place 3 stars instead of 2.

Our server got our order right and it came out quickly so I&#39;m not going to slam him for his service, but serious... he mumbled his words at high speed like he&#39;s said them 1000 times.  The problem is I haven&#39;t heard them once, even after he said them.  It was turning into a joke. At the end of the meal he brought the check and wished us a good day (at least I think that&#39;s what he mumbled) we looked at each other like, &#34;What did you say...?&#34;

My burger was good, but it&#39;s not enough to make me want to return.  The camping motif is not done well enough that is makes the trip to Kinfork more than just a place to eat. The inside, as far as interesting or fun go, is on par with Denny&#39;s.  Not the food, just the ambiance and decor.  If someone is telling me they have a theme then have that experience surround you... Like Buca di Beppo, or Bill&#39;s pizza, or Rainforest Cafe, or Ed Debevic&#39;s...  or even Bob Chins."

Our only past visit was during a Yelp Elite event earlier this year in April, and Kinfork provided quite a memorable variety of good food and drink offerings during that outing.   Monday&#39;s daily special is 1/2 off on their 1/2 lb. Backyard Burgers, and being a good budget-minded retiree, that&#39;s what I had.   Wife had one with sweet potato fries, and I had one with smoked gouda cheese and tater tots (which were delectable).  We also got a nice generous serving of hush puppy appetizers with our Yelp check-in (very good and dipping sauce was a little on spicy side).  The highlight of the meal though was the burnt ends appetizer we also ordered.  These were nicely charred and blackened on the outside, and moist and boneless inside, and came with a nice pickle relish slaw.  These were miles better than the renowned BE&#39;s we once tried at Real Urban Barbeque.   The burgers were just ok, and the patties tasted of the frozen variety, but no complaints really given the daily special pricing."

Let me count the ways...1) You&#39;re not Amazon Prime.  2) There&#39;s people.  So many people.  3) Why are you a freaking Labyrinth?  4) I should probably stop this list because it will never end.   

Seriously though, if it wasn&#39;t for my stop at Kinfork I may have committed homicide this day.  Luckily, there&#39;s a new restaurant in this hell they call a mall and they serve BBQ with tots!, have a Bloody Mary/Mimosa bar, the best macaroni and cheese you will ever have pass your lips, and there&#39;s beeeeeeeeeer, glorious beeeeeeeeeer.  What else could you ask for really?  Oh, and the place looks pretty cool too if you&#39;re into that whole hipstery/modern/industrial vibe.

We ended up getting smaller plates (the pot roast grilled cheese, soup, the pork belly sliders, and a mac and cheese meal with tots for the baby (which we ate every last morsel of...thanks, kid!) and all were good but the mac and cheese {and the tots!} was definitely the greatest meal that day.  Next time I wouldn&#39;t get the sliders because the pork belly was just too fatty (though I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s just the nature of eating pork belly) but I would most certainly try some other smoked meat with that glorious mac and cheese.  As a matter of fact, I might just order everything off the kids menu and go to town.  

The beer list was pretty decent and like I said, there was a Bloody Mary/Mimosa bar since it was Sunday, which is pretty much the greatest thing ever if you can make decisions.  I can&#39;t,  so I sadly had to pass.  It called my name every time I passed it though so next time I might just have to bite the bullet and figure out how to make the greatest Bloody Mary ever.

Service was slow.  I believe it took about 45 minutes to get our 4 entrees out to us.  I did not find the restaurant too noisy as some other reviewers have stated.  

Scrutinize your bill before paying.  We were charged for two ice teas when we only ordered one.  The server quickly corrected the total."

I just love the environment that they create! It&#39;s inviting and comfortable but still has a classy feel to it. I gave up cheese for lent, so many of the dishes I was unable to have, but my friend and I did get to enjoy the nachos without cheese. And I really mean we enjoyed them!!! There wasn&#39;t a single topping left on the dish. They had pot roast, jalapeños, diced tomatoes and green onion with sour cream graciously spiraled around the top. I do want to try them again when lent is over so I can indulge in the cheese that I saw on other tables portions, but I digress. For my entree, I had the barbecue brisket handheld, but I substituted the ciabatta for herb focaccia. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The waiter, Michael, said that the sandwich would be smaller because the ciabatta is actually bigger, but I seriously mean this sandwich was perfect. The brisket, just like at the Rack House, just falls apart in your mouth. If there&#39;s one thing these places know how to do- it&#39;s barbecue, hands down! The sandwich was also still very large! I finished it, but only had one of my tator tots because I was beyond full. Next time I will save the other half for the following day.  This visit I didn&#39;t try any of the beverages, but I saw that some of the same Rack House moonshine cocktails were available. I&#39;ll update my review when I try some of those too. :)

Which is partially because the style is gorgeous (modern camp theme, mason jars EVERYWHERE) and partially because the lunch entrees aren&#39;t where they need to be to justify the price. 

We kicked things off with hush puppies, served with peach creme fraiche. I was a big fan of the crumb inside the hush puppies, which had whole corn kernels and bits of jalapeño peppers in them. The outside was deep-fried to a nice, dark-brown color, leaving quite a few crispy bits. Overall I thought the appetizer was pretty well done.

As for the Carolina Pulled Pork, another signature item? The baked potato was pretty standard, with the exception of a bit of kosher salt sprinkled among the outside (an idea I&#39;m going to steal the next time I bake potatoes). The inside was a bit dense. I had sour cream, which was nice, and butter in little plastic containers, which is an... odd... presentation choice.

It also came with cornbread, which was all right. This recipe is of the denser variety, with a few corn kernels and good corn flavor.

The pork itself was nicely tender but didn&#39;t have the smokiness I was looking for (the more, the merrier as far as I&#39;m concerned!). It was paired with a barbecue sauce that claimed to be a red Carolina vinegar sauce but I could&#39;ve easily confused with something bottled. Which gets to the main criticism I have of Kinfork.

The food is pretty damn basic. Just because the theme is campy, doesn&#39;t mean the food has to be campy too! The pork needs more smoke, and maybe some crispy bits. The barbecue sauce needs a lot more depth, starting with the cider vinegar. The potato maybe ought to be fluffed. The cole slaw needs to be better than the generic creamy stuff from Sizzler. My wife&#39;s salad mix needs fresher lettuce.

This might sound like a lot to ask, but it is a $14 lunch entree, and our bill came to $44 before tip (and we don&#39;t drink alcohol!). So I think it&#39;s a fair ask.

But look. If they improve the food, Kinfork has a really good future in Schaumburg. I hope, though, they&#39;re a quick learner."

I did for restaurant week and I now understand why. The meatloaf was very good, a nice firm texture with the ability to break apart into manageable pieces then coated with a nice sweet bbq type sauce. It was very good!

It comes with brocollini which was cooked perfectly, tender but snappy and had a nice flavor to them as well.  It also came with mashed potatoes that were creamy and buttery.  There was some random seasoning in it as well which made it much better than normal mash.  

I find it interesting getting food that is very homey but elevated to the next level. Service was excellent, very friendly and welcoming.  

Also tried a few of the desserts

Strawberry Shortcake - it&#39;s more like a sundae kinda, it gave you the next texture of soaked in shortcake with a marscapone topping to give it some richness.

Peach Cobbler - Very tender peachy peaches.  It is topped with local, according to the server, Homer&#39;s vanilla ice cream. The ice cream is great. The crumbles are good as well.

Apple Cobbler - Apples that have been cooked to a gentle softness, not mush, made this a great texture contract to the vanilla ice cream. It also came with brown sugar crumbles that were much larger than the peach cobbler. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I normally don&#39;t like fruit based desserts but this one was great and I kept wanting more!

I was told that a lunch menu is coming, I look forward to that."

Needless to say, I&#39;ve been waiting for this place to open.

They are located in the mall (their sign outside is red, it&#39;s not very big). The atmosphere is casual, but nice. This is not your hole-in-the-wall place. They do take reservations, and even though we made one on a weekday at lunch time, we didn&#39;t need it. I don&#39;t know if they just are not busy in general, or they are not busy during this time. Anyways, we were seated right away. The theme is campground meets comfort food.

They have a full bar and drink menu, but since we were on lunch break, we didn&#39;t drink. We ordered the hush puppies, pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts. Everything was really good. They are light on the sauce for the sandwiches, but if you ask for some on the side they will give it to you. The menu is pretty similar to Rack House. There were a few differences...but for the most part it was the same.

The service was ok. For not being that busy I didn&#39;t feel like our server did the best he could do. It wasn&#39;t bad by any means. We waited a while to get our bill settled. This is important at lunch time since they are located in an area that is near many businesses (people are on their lunch breaks and need to get back in a timely manner).

I would definitely come back, but I feel like they need to differentiate themselves a little bit more from Rack House and improve their service. Otherwise it would be 5 stars."

I ordered the Whitefish dinner, which comes with a pretzel bread crusted whitefish, roasted potatoes, brussel sprouts and a mustard butter sauce. The mustard sauce was excellent, as it pairs perfectly with all parts of the dish. Unfortunately though they were rather stingy with the sauce. The brussel sprouts were a little under done.

They were out of quite a few of their beers (the ones I tried ordering).

The service was very helpful and they offered samples of some of the beers.

The prices are average as are the portions."

Our waiter was nice and polite and unfortunately I didn&#39;t get his name. Anyway, to make the story short, I ordered pork and beans for sides, and a porkchop with brocolli and fries for entree.

Well, when I got my porkchop, outside, everything looked great; however, when I started eating it, I noticed that it was not cooked the way I wanted it, as I want it to be well done (I wasn&#39;t asked by the waiter, how I wanted it to be cook, though). After a couple of bites, I was not able to finish it since it was a big portion, so I took it for to go.

I  went home and a couple of hours, got hungry, heat it up, then was trying to eat the left over porkchop when I found out, it was not cooked all the way. Man, what a waste. Of course, I didn&#39;t finish it, It sucks. :-(

I wanted to give you guys a credit for good customer service and great ambience, nevertheless, won&#39;t be coming back for second round. I&#39;m sorry."

I was happy with the hushpuppies--light and not greasy at all, cant stop eating them...but the sauce with them was weird---that&#39;s the only word I can think of...weird--peach something and should not be served with those pillowy hushpuppies!! I had the flatbread which was strange to see flatbread on an otherwise &#39;country&#39; theme menu. It was ok. Husband got some meaty monstrosity---brisket? pulled pork? I dont know--it was ok. He was very happy with it. Portions were a little small for the price but I guess you pay for being in Woodfield mall (which I would NEVER do but we were here for the Yelp event so we just gave it a try).

The atmosphere has this rustic chic vibe going on. They have these mini walls of mason jars, beautiful copper colored lights that gives like a candlelight feeling, and comfy chairs and booths. 

The service on all counts was great. From the hostess who answered my phone, the manager who gave me a quick mini tour, and the bussers. They were efficient and polite. As soon as I arrived they asked me for my reservation, anytime a plate was empty it was taken away. My server for the night was Nick. He gave great suggestions and had good timing. He asked how every plate of food and asked if I needed anything occasionally. I hate going to restaurants and having to flag down a person or wait 20 minutes for ketchup or a new fork-doesn&#39;t happen here. 

The menu also had a wide variety of food for people who are health conscious. Lots of different salads and healthy entrees like fish and chicken."

We started our new culinary adventure off with some cocktails. I tried the &#34;orange crushed,&#34; which our waitress Christin (who was very sweet and helpful) said tasted very similar to orange soda, and she was right. My husband had the &#34;electric lemonade.&#34; I tried a sip and was reminded of a mature version of Mike&#39;s Hard Lemonade without the sugary aftertaste.

As an appetizer, we had the hushpuppies, and they were amazing. I haven&#39;t eaten too many types of hushpuppies in my time, but those I&#39;ve tried have usually been nothing but rock-hard in texture. These were crispy on the outside yet easy to cut into with a fork. They also had a nice kick and paired fabulously with the sweet peach crème fraiche, which reminded me of peach yogurt. I constantly found myself dipping my fingers in it and demanded that the waitress leave it at our table as a sauce for my tots.

For our main meal, my husband ordered the &#34;carolina pulled pork&#34; with a side of tots. Being a fan of barbecue, I was very tempted to order the ribs but wasn&#39;t super hungry and tried the &#34;chicken pesto panini&#34; with tots instead. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it wasn&#39;t a bad sandwich, but it could have used a little more flavor, especially in the chicken itself. The tomato focaccia was good but got a little soggy after a while due to the pesto and juice of the tomato. I was disappointed to see that the tots were the standard frozen kind, especially when everything else we ordered appeared to be made from scratch. I tried a bite of my husband&#39;s pulled pork, which wasn&#39;t too bad, but not the best pulled pork I&#39;ve ever tasted. Not being a fan of cole slaw, I thought the jalapeño kind garnished on the sandwich was rather tasty.

In addition to our starter cocktails, my husband also tried the &#34;back porch.&#34; I took a sip of it, and it reminded me of a more alcoholic berry Kool-Aid.

I found the overall ambiance of this place warm and welcoming, from the decor to the entrancing smell of barbecue and alternative rock tunes blaring in the background. I hope to come back here again someday with a hungrier stomach to try the ribs!"

Or did the back kitchen chefs eat all the lobster chunks out of it?? The hubby&#39;s meatloaf came out ok, broccoli cooked to perfection. My half slab of ribs was dry, no paying customer wants to discard chunks of rib meat or have to politely pull them out of their mouth because it&#39;s rock hard and questionable meat because it was cooked past the jerky stage....slaw accompanied was nice to offset the sugary sauce, the corn bread was OK, the baked potato was a rock!! A small side of sour cream was to accompany it, but could they add a little extra effort and add butter? Disappointed because I kept asking my husband to check it out, only to be let down"

First off the look was very rustic. I loved every part of the atmosphere. Definitely can see myself watching the hawks with some s&#39;more skillet after work. 

Service was good and so was the food. 
I had the pulled pork and my brother had chili. The chili was a bit watered down but good taste. However, they are still working out the kinks. 
Pulled pork was delicious but i personally like a more sweet pork and this was more smoky. 
Food tasted like something i would eat at my parents, home-cooked. 
I work at the mall so i like food that doesn&#39;t over do it.

Meatloaf was just so-so, and I wasn&#39;t a fan of the dry rub on the wings. It was way too sweet without enough spice. The bbq sauce was a little too peppery for me. This is all very subjective, obviously. Maybe others love it. The coleslaw was spor on. The was really good. The desserts were fantastic - my favorite part! The smores, apple crisp (loved!), bananas foster, and strawberry shortcake (extra loved!) were all so good! I really like the vibe, like a modern/rustic/country feel.

The broccollini was terrible, it came out a stem of broccoli covered In chopped garlic and burned the throat. They did take it back and offer something else.

The Brussels sprouts were amazing.

I&#39;d recommend the hushpuppies, pulled pork, all of the salads, and the moonshine cocktails. I was particularly impressed with their salads as I really wasn&#39;t expecting an American food/southern food/comfort food restaurant to have good salad. The leaves were fresh, the cheeses sharp, the choice of ingredients well paired, and the dressings were well balanced and really tied each of the 3 salads I tried together into its own unique and delicious side/meal. While I can&#39;t really figure out what to classify their genre of food as (it&#39;s not quite comfort food, not quite southern food, and not just typical &#34;american&#34; food), I did enjoy the selection and felt like the theme made sense.

I would go back for those alone, but I&#39;ll need to check out the hush puppies as well. They are very veg-friendly, so I had a hard time deciding what to order. I landed on the vegetable flat bred. Very light and tasty, but nothing to write home about.The side of broccolini was perfection though.

Unfortunately, there&#39;s not much making them unique from all the other options in the area. They certainly don&#39;t have the best burgers or BBQ. If this place was more like Hash House a Go Go, it would be great.

The Brick Chicken and veggies were truly fantastic! So much flavor and cooked perfectly. However, I still wouldn&#39;t come back just to have that. A lot of menu items are definitely overpriced (including the chicken). As tempting as it sounds, I suggest not getting BBQ here. I tried some of their sauce on the side with the chicken and it&#39;s definitely disappointing as others have mentioned - (just not good flavor). I&#39;m glad I steered clear of the BBQ options.

I had the Grilled Cheese, which as Roast Beef as an ingredient.  Now, I realize the name of the Sandwich was Grilled Cheese, not Grilled Cheese with Roast Beef, but there was one thin slice on the sandwich, to me hardly worth mentioning.  The tomato on the sandwich was cold and hard.  And the cheese was not gooey, as the sandwich was cold.  I had it with Tater Tots, but only had one or two, as they had a weird aftertaste, perhaps the oil had been used too long.

My dining partner had the Brisket Sandwich, which was okay, but hardly any sauce on it and the brisket was tough.  Again, it was cold.  Also, as someone else said, the jalapeno coleslaw was tasteless, however the dressing did add needed moisture to the sandwich.  

Our server, when she saw I did not finish my tots, asked me why I did not tell her.  It was hard to tell her as she spent most of her time speaking with friends at another table and only stopped by immediately after we got our food, and we did not see her again until she brought the bill."

They even have rooms big enough for big parties or social events.  All the servers were nice and the food tasted great. I went with the Meat loaf which is enough food for 2 people. the meat was nicely cooked and seasoned and even had a slight sweet taste to it.

The s&#39;mores dessert was meh.  More marshmallows than there was chocolate &amp; graham crackers.

The second time I came here I wanted to try something different &amp; went with the Pot Pie.  It was a little too salty.  My fiance ordered the Rigatoni Pasta &amp; he absolutely hated it.  I tasted it &amp; it was really bland.  It sounded really good from what the menu had described. So that was disappointing, &amp; he never wants to come back. 

The menu could be better in my opinion.  Appetizers come out really fast but then your actual meal takes forever to come out.

Not very appetizing. The chips were homemade so I ordered them over the frozen fries or tots, but they were really really greasy and I couldn&#39;t finish them. 
The second time I ordered their &#34;smash burger&#34; with fries. They don&#39;t cook burgers to order and when I received the food the meat could have been of any quality because it was over cooked and tasteless. The fries were average, for frozen fried variety. A big however though--- I ate this at noon and it&#39;s midnight and I can&#39;t sleep because my stomach still hurts. Ack. 
Maybe I&#39;ll give this place some time and then go back and see if they&#39;ve worked out some issues. It&#39;s a pretty atmosphere but you&#39;ve really got to stand on your food and at this point, I&#39;d rather have Jimmy Johns which is unfortunate."

The Cheese Curd&#39;s with White BBQ Sauce and Beer Cheese Dip with Warm Pretzel appetizer&#39;s were outstanding. I ordered the brisket dinner and was not impressed. It was dry and they put some type of liquid on top of it to try and moisten it. The BBQ Sauce was not tasty at all. However, their desserts were delicious when combined with the appetizer&#39;s is the only reason I am giving them 4 stars. I will go back to try other interesting entree&#39;s on their menu."

Good customer service from our server. Nice and friendly atmosphere, loved those mason jars. Food was good.  Ordered Nachos for starter, it was okay.

The restaurant was not overly crowded as there were many unoccupied tables.  Service was friendly, but it took a long time to get our food.  Once we did get our food, it was average, nothing outstanding, but not bad.  The salmon was good, but had a bit too much seasoning for my taste.  Sandwiches and chicken wings were just OK.  We wanted sweet potato fries, but they said they were out.  The strawberry shortcake dessert was presented in a goblet, sort of mashed together.  The cost was $6 and was OK, but nothing special.

For the quality of the food, I felt the prices were a tad high.  No bread or crackers were served while you are waiting for your food.  There are several large private function rooms.  There are TVs with various shows playing, some of which were not kid friendly.  Decor is casual and inviting.  Servers and greeters are very friendly."

We are fans of the owners other restaurant Rack House in Arlington Heights. I can say that I&#39;m a bigger fan of this place. The atmosphere which many people have already spoken of is superb. The music isn&#39;t overpowering, the lighting is great, not too bright or dark. 

For me, the reason I gave this restaurant 5 stars is for 2 reasons. First, because they have Schlitz on the menu. I&#39;m a fan of the beer and knowing that I can get a 16oz tall boy for $4 is a win for me. Secondly, and much more importantly is the meat loaf dinner. I cannot speak more highly about how delicious it was. At $15 it was on the pricier side, but worth every penny. You will get roughly 8-10oz of homemade meatloaf. I can tell that they used both beef and pork the way every good meatloaf should be made, however so seldom is. You get a mound of real mashed potatoes and a plentiful helping of broccolini. They also layer a rich pan sauce on the meatloaf.

This restaurant feels like a modern take on the old-fashioned supper clubs. You can get a supper club dinner, however they have sandwiches and real, smoked BBQ. I will certainly be visiting Kinfork many times in the coming months/years."

The atmosphere is very welcoming, and the decor is really nice. We had great and timely service. I ordered the Grilled Cheese Lunch special. 

When my sandwich came to the table, I took a bite out of my sandwich and noticed there was no pot roast on it (there was supposed to be). I took another bite, thinking maybe it was just really small, but there wasn&#39;t any meat on the sandwich.  I then alerted the waiter about the oversight. He said that he would let the chef know and bring me a new sandwich. Which I thought was great. 

BUT, to my dismay, he took my sandwich that I had taken 2 bites out of back to the kitchen, the chef put meat on it (a sandwich that had already been eaten off of), extra meat on the side and brought it back to my table. I was shocked that this happened in such a nice restaurant. I ate the sandwich, and it was very good, but I was very turned off by the way this situation was handled.

Happy hour was great; dinner was not. Up charge to sub Brussels sprouts for veggie couscous seemed excessive. My husband&#39;s salmon was undercooked. The worst, however, was the brisket flatbread which is marked as a specialty of the house. It was dry and chewy to the point of difficult to eat. There was approximately 2 ounces of diced beef on top. There was so little sauce that I ended up dipping it into the white sauce from the hush puppies. I let my server know that it was not good.

I ordered the Carolina pulled pork and it came to the table looking like it had been extruded from a large ice cream scoop. The pork was rather flavorless and just wasn&#39;t cooked well for what I&#39;d expect of quality BBQ. My wife ordered the Pesto Chicken and was not impressed.

I always order a ribeye at every new Resturant I go too.  It&#39;s kinda my personal gauge. The ribeye was 35 dollars. Broccolini, mash potatoes and the steak. I feel like I&#39;m seeing these same side at a lot of places lately.  I ordered it medium rare.  It came in a reasonable amount of time. The plate was nice and warm and the presentation was good.  The steak looked great  First off I tasted the broccolini and it was fabulous.  It was tasty and somehow infused with a perfect smokiness, best broccolini I&#39;ve ever had. The mash potatoes were good but nothing special.  Then I cut into my steak. It looked perfectly medium rare. As soon as it hit my mouth though I noticed it was ..... Cold.  The mash potatoes and broccolini were perfect and the plate was warm but the steak was cold.  I touched other spots on it and it was all the same.  I would like to add though that the seasoning / chat tasted spot on.  If this steak wasn&#39;t cold.  It would of been great.   I told the server and he took my plate away.  A manager returned with my plate.  It was noticeably more charred. It was hot now, but it was also not medium rare any more.  When the manager returned to ask how it was I explained all this.  He apologized and asked me if we need anything.  I asked for another drink and he returned with it.  

At the end of the meal the bill came and nothing was discounted or offered up free.  Maybe a drink or something.  Nothing.   I didn&#39;t ask for a discount. But considering the experience I found it a bit odd.  

Overall I really want to like this place and I want to give it a second chance.  That steak had the potential to be great.  But I left a tad disgruntled."

I tried both the chicken and BBQ beef brisket and they are both very good. Though the chicken was a little over seasoned. 

I will agree with others that the service was slow especially for a Monday afternoon which wasn&#39;t busy at all. The waiter entered our order incorrectly which made the wait even longer. I was also given cold fries which is not cool. But before I could even say anything; someone from the kitchen brought out a plate of hot, fresh fries for me.

Next came the entrees: The ribs with sauce were fall off the bone great, those who ordered dry ribs with sauce on the side got room temperature chewy meat. The brisket was juicy, but again, room temperature; a big thing with the brisket was that the fat had not been skimmed very well and the portions were not uniform.. Most of the ten of us didn&#39;t get sauce, butter or sour cream on our platters. Some of the platters came out with the incorrect potatoes, so we were served at different times. Awkward.

I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and it was tasty! The pork had a great smoky taste to it, which I loved and I topped it off with some of their signature spicy barbecue sauce.

The place was not crowded at all. Not very busy. I wasn&#39;t impressed with the place. I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip just to go here...but it is definitely a place I would consider eating at again."

As I said, we ordered of the appetizer menu, so it was a nice surprise to find that the portions were pretty big.

I forgot that there was a Blackhawks game. The place was PACKED!!! Even so, they did find a place quickly to seat me. 

The server was running around to at least 10 tables and doing so with great efficiency.  She was awesome (Melanie?) and cheerful even under stress.  The beer selection is fairly large and the had a couple that I hadn&#39;t tried yet elsewhere. 

I ordered a steak bloody rare and I swear it moo&#39;d at me. Perfection!!!!!  Great favor, wonderful garlic mashed potatoes and a black as night porter beer.  All while watching the hockey. I call that Man Night! 

I left a 25% tip and headed out for a cigar."

We had a reservation, which ended up not really being necessary for a Wednesday night. This place is pretty big. They have a big wrap around bar and plenty of seating for big parties and others. 

They have a decent beer menu (especially on tap). Their list wasn&#39;t up to date (there were some beers on the list that they no longer serve). Honestly most of the craft beers on the menu I had heard of, but they aren&#39;t bad. They have a full bar if beer isn&#39;t your thing.

As far as food goes, it is all over the board. Soups, salads, burgers, steaks, wraps, sandwiches, you name it. I ended up going with the Turkey Burger served with fries, bacon, cheese, and a cranberry mayo. It was alright. The meat was dry and there really wasn&#39;t any flavor. The cranberry mayo was the best part. 

Overall they are decently priced (except the steaks). The waitress was very attentive at first, but then later didn&#39;t come around as much. She was good about splitting checks.

So it wasn&#39;t amazing, but not terrible."

We were actually over an hour early for our reservation. Appetizers were onion rings and the southwest egg rolls. They were both fresh and delicious! The southwest egg rolls tasted great made and was accompanied by chipolte ranch. It cooled off the egg rolls since there was a slight kick to them. The onion rings were served with saracha mayo. My husband seemed to enjoy them.
For dinner he had the fish n chips and I ventured out and ordered the Lousiana pasta dish with chicken. 
The seasoning within my pasta &amp; chicken dish simply danced on my tongue. The sauce is a creamy delicious reminder of my very recent trip to N&#39;awlins. If you have ever been there, this dish will bring you right back. 
Sadly, my husband was found of the restaurants version of tartar sauce but used the siracha mayo from his onion rings.

The two of us walk in 9:30pm on Saturday 8/13 and wait around the front door to be seated. Two waitresses walk past us but don&#39;t acknowledge us. A few minutes go by of us just waiting by the hostess counter waiting to be seated or told what to do. By this time another couple also comes in and waits with us. We all wait another couple minutes or so for someone to acknowledge us or something when a Hispanic guy with earrings and short, dark hair walks up to the hostess counter and leans his elbow on it while reading something on the counter. He is right next to us but says nothing so I say, &#34;Excuse me, do we just go ahead and seat ourselves?&#34; He takes a second to finish what he&#39;s reading, then looks up to say, &#34;Nope&#34; and looks back down at the counter.

At this point we just left. As we were getting into the car we saw that the other couple waiting with us must have had the same idea, as they were also walking to their car.

I could be more forgiving of the attitude and lack of service if the place was super busy or something but there were only a handful of people sitting at the bar and maybe four or five tables with people sitting at them. If this is the kind of traffic the place gets on a Saturday night, maybe it&#39;s a good thing we went somewhere else."

I&#39;m not sure what I was really expecting as I&#39;ve never heard of this place before. 

It seemed like the menu was pretty standard. You&#39;ll find burgers and fried apps like mozzarella sticks, with some steaks and seafood things as well.  This is the kind of place where you pretty much know what&#39;s on the menu before you walk in the door.  There wasn&#39;t anything that I was too impressed with but everyone I was with seemed to enjoy.  I will say this though, the inferno burger was Damn spicy.  And I can take the heat.  

For being in Schaumburg this place is just fine hence the 3 stars. The service and quality of the food was good. There was just nothing that stood out to me.  I&#39;d say its a good spot for a family gathering as they are very accommodating for large groups."

We came in at 5pm on Sunday, a group of 10 of us, after the Schaumburg Boomers game, to have an early dinner and cap off a birthday celebration.

We were seated right away, as we had a reservation, in the &#34;dining room&#34; part of the restaurant, which was fine.  It wasn&#39;t too loud, and we were able to converse easily.

Our server was a little flaky.  One of my friends ordered a drink that is served with lemon, but there was no lemon.  I asked for a lime when I ordered my beer, but it came without.  When I asked again for the lime, she brought it bare-handed to me.  No thanks.  Maybe a lesson in sanitation, Stonewood?  She checked if everything tasted okay once, and then was pretty absent.

The food was decent, the portions were great.  I ordered the pork chops, and it was two LARGE boneless center-cut chops.  My man and I could&#39;ve split this with an extra side dish.  Speaking of the side dishes - meh.  The &#34;sauteed&#34; veggies were 100% steamed green beans with zero flavor, and the yukon gold mashed potatoes were dense and luke-warm at best.  It&#39;s never a good sign when my man sticks his finger straight into the middle of his mashed potatoes to check if they&#39;re hot.

For the portion size, the prices were pretty standard... I just don&#39;t think I was impressed enough to go back."

My husband and I came for the fish fry special. We were told there was a 25 minute wait but we could sit at the bar and eat if we wanted. So we sat at the long left table by the bar and started looking at the menu. A few minutes later a lady (hostess?) came over and told us we would not be served at the chair rails but could be at the bar.... So we circle the bar looking for 2 seats next to each other (which there weren&#39;t any). So husband and I resigned ourselves for a wait. 

We give our name and are told we have to give our phone number because they well text when our table is ready...wait, what? I tell them no, you can tell me when my table is ready. The male host says &#34;or you could just sit at the chair rail?&#34;

Apparently the right chair rail gets served but the left is for people waiting for a table? Have these people heard of signs?

I pointed out to the host that if services was not provided at the chair rail they shouldn&#39;t put menus their...but was told that he menus were there for drinks.

I almost walked out, but husband had a taste for fish and chips. Food came out in about 2 minutes and didn&#39;t taste particularly fresh. Chips were soggy. Way below what I am used to at this establishment."

I got the southwest egg rolls appetizer as my meal. It had just the right amount of spice mixed with savor. My fiance had order a side of chips, so I tried the different flavors of barbecue sauces they had. My favorite sauce overall was the Carolina sauce. It was sweet but not overly so, with a scrumptious seasoned aftertaste. The Smoky sauce was exactly what it sounds like. It tasted like the smell of an amazing campfire on a hot, summer day.

Other favorites include the burgers, Thai steak salad, French onion soup (CHEESY!), and southwest egg rolls. Not to mention, the kitchen is open till 2AM!!!

They seemed to have the best craft beer specials of any of the local bars. We were also surprised to find out that they had 1/2 priced appetizers as well. Each day features different beer and food specials. My husband ordered an Eliot Ness and I went with the Revolution Anti-Hero. 

The food is what you would expect at most bars, but all of it was good. We got the frickles (fried pickles) and the loaded potato skins. It ended up being about $8 for the two apps after the Happy Hour discount. The skins were my favorite because they were loaded with scallions and cheese. 

Our servers name was Chrissy. She was really nice and kept checking on us to make sure our drinks were always full. Since mine was in a can, she couldn&#39;t tell if mine was empty or not, but I ended up nursing it the whole time. I liked the ambiance of the place too.

I only had two craft beers and a plate of chicken nachos, but left $30 poorer.  Beer prices were typical, but the assemble-your-own chicken nachos were $9.99 for a few tablespoons of bone-dry chicken diced into tiny bits.  The four round crisp corn tortas were difficult to eat and were equivalent to 16 tortilla chips.

Can you believe the tax was 11%!?

My advice to the owners: lagers should be served around 40F and ales 50F, fix those nachos, and elect someone who&#39;ll lower your crazy taxes."

I wouldn&#39;t say it was amazing, but they do deliver on their promise. The reason this place isn&#39;t a 5 star is mostly that it&#39;s just not my type - sports bars and the beers that typically accompany them provide me of no interest. 

Aside from that, lets get to the many good things:
There are a considerable number of vegetarian options, which require some careful reading or you may miss them. Basically, you can get any burger with a veggie burger instead of beef patty with whatever seasoning combo they offer. This is exactly what I did, getting an inferno burger with the veggie patty, along with a pretzel bun.

I guess I missed the part of &#34;the bun is small compared to the burger&#34;, because the veggie burger itself was not too far from being twice the size of the bun. That&#39;s not a complaint as much as simply being a surprise.

Also, when they say the inferno burger is hot, they are not kidding. It&#39;s not hot on the first bite, but it definitely builds as you eat the burger.  It was enough that maybe I should have skipped on some of the habanero, but I didn&#39;t. 

In addition, they currently serve (Seasonally) pumpkin ale, which is some good stuff.  Service was also friendly, and food was served pretty promptly.  So while this place is not my style, I think a lot of people would probably be happy with it in general."

1.  This place is HUGE.  I don&#39;t think I have ever waited for a table here ever.
2.  The beer list is pretty impressive.  I mean, if you are a TOTAL beer snob you may never be impressed, but even I can find several things I love to drink on their menu, and that&#39;s something.
3.  The burgers here are pretty damn good.  The peanut butter and banana burger was the bomb.  I know it sounds gross, but there is something about melty peanut butter and bananas on a sandwich that just make everything I hate about the world go away for a few minutes.  Elvis knows what I&#39;m talking about.
4.  The menu is HUGE.  If you can&#39;t find something to eat here, you probably aren&#39;t happy with ANY menu and you probably shouldn&#39;t leave the house.  Ever.

Things I don&#39;t like:

1.  The fried pickles.  BLECH.  They&#39;re big slices of pickle (at least they&#39;re not spears, I suppose) and tons of thick breading.  Just not my bag, man.
2.  The service is hit or miss...you&#39;re really never sure how long you&#39;ll be there depending on how good or bad your server is."

Went here with the wife and a couple of friends and we had a great time with drinks and appetizers. 

Food was delicious. A standout was definitely the cornflake crusted chicken tender thing. Just loved the flavor. Beer selection on draft was amazing as well.

Service was great and overall we were very pleased.

Only con I can think of was the place can be packed and parking hard to come by. I guess that&#39;s why they have complementary valet, but sometimes I just don&#39;t like using the service."

The service was pleasant, but slow.  We came on a Sunday around 7pm, and the place was pretty empty.  Once we put the order in for our food, we never saw the waitress again.  We had to go searching for her to get the check so we could get out of there.

They boast a large menu and have a few vegetarian entreea,  though I think they should make a small vegetarian menu with 4 or 5 items.

You can&#39;t go wrong ordering a burger here.  However if you want it medium, ask for medium rare.  Everytime I ask for medium its over done and when I finally asked for medium rare  it came out a perfect.  They also have really good fish and chips.

The beer menu is great and they usually have different specials everyday of the week which is awesome.  I usually spend about $16. That included my entree and 2 beers.

Lastly the only item I would skip are the fried pickles.  They only give you 5 and they are spears.  For a group of 4 it isn&#39;t enough especially since they are $9"

I hadn&#39;t eaten anything prior in the day and was in the mood for a veggie burger and seeing that they have veggie patties I was like this is great! The menu is nothing more than a copycat of Red Robin. We decided to get an appetizer...frickles (their version of fried pickles). They were actually pretty good. For dinner I decided to get the southwest burger. It wasn&#39;t that great...pretty dry and the fries were bland...not to mention we waited a fairly long time for our food to come out (about 20 minutes) but the table next to us who literally sat down and ordered food got their food within 7 minutes. Within an hour after leaving the place I started to feel sick. What was supposed to be a relaxing night ended with me in the bathroom. The guacamole that came with the burger tasted funny and was warm. I figured I had gotten a mild case of food poisoning and am still nauseous. Needless to say I will not be returning to this establishment.

  I was especially impressed by the music selection.  Great variety and upbeat without being too loud or obnoxious.

They have tons of draft, bottle, wine and cocktail ideas to whet your whistle. I ordered the Stonewood Lemonade, which was on special for the day, without looking at what it entailed. I was so pleased that it wasn&#39;t just like a vodka lemonade- it was more of an Arnold Palmer with a kick! Super delicious! We just had time for the one drink, but the bartenders checked on us multiple times, and it was more than one bartender too, which was great for those ordering multiple drinks- no wait! 

I&#39;ve never seen a bar that had long tables, with one-sided seating. Interesting concept! One thing I didn&#39;t love was in the bathroom. The baby changing station was just the end of the counter, with a curled up laminated sign that marked what it was.

We finally came on a Friday night for dinner and boy were we disappointed!

First off, my friend ordered a strawberry martini and when it arrived the rim was scantily covered with sugar.  Then when she tasted it, it was pretty terrible.  It tasted like what fake watermelon flavor tastes like...and this drink was supposed to be a strawberry martini!   On the other hand, I ordered a Goose Island Matilda so my drink was fine. 

For our entrees, I ordered the jambalaya because I was feeling risky (I shouldn&#39;t have expected much from an Ale House but I was in the YOLO mood..poor decision!), while my friend ordered the carbonara pasta.  Our dishes came out pretty fast which was great since we were both starving.

My jambalaya wasn&#39;t bad per se but it definitely did not impress me.  It was moreso nondescript.  The andouille sausage wasn&#39;t too flavorful and was a bit overcooked in my opinion; the few slices of peppers in the dish also didn&#39;t help.  The jambalaya also came with a side of a breadstick which I thought was quite random and out of place.  As for my friend&#39;s carbonara entree, I didn&#39;t get to ask her exactly what was wrong with it but she did mention it was below average pasta.  

I could have handled the mediocre food because I was in good company but the service wasn&#39;t that great either.  When we were done eating, our waitress asked if we staying for longer to drink.  I still had half a glass of beer left so I felt like it was obvious we weren&#39;t done yet.  Then once she gave us our bills, she just stood a little behind our table waiting which made it a little awkward.  My friend and I planned on staying longer to just chat after dinner and our waitress kept walking back and forth by our table and even gave us weird side glances.  

I wouldn&#39;t recommend going to Stonewood just for the food.  It would be ideal if you&#39;re going to watch a game because they have a lot of TVs at the bar.  One good thing about Stonewood is the people watching.  They had a lot of interesting characters that night to observe if you&#39;re into that kind of thing.  Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you!"

So far this is the latest I&#39;ve found in Schaumburg. It&#39;s such a chill bar, the service is always friendly and I always can have a relaxing time with friends. Food served until 2 &amp; liquor until 245, top that off with food &amp; drinks that are actually good - all of that makes it a usual hot spot for me.

My absolute favorite item on their menu is the Bacon &amp; Egg Burger for $10.99 with Applewood smoked bacon, American cheese and a fried egg. The Crispy Cod Sandwich for $9.99 is another favorite of mine. If you&#39;re up for a something fun &amp; different, try their Elvis Burger with his noted favorites of peanut butter &amp; bananas for $9.99

I&#39;ve tried every appetizer on their menu and my favorites are the Bavarian Pretzel Sticks for $7.99 and Potato Skins for $8.29. My company has had post work meetups here and Stonewood has always catered really well to us. We call Stonewood, they reserve an awesome section for us, keep an open tab as we rack up a slew of appetizers and drinks, and always have someone nice take care of us.

Thanks to these little work events I&#39;ve tried a long list of drinks on their menu - they have MANY drink specials each day. That could mean a PBR for $2.50 (always reliable hipster cheapness), Two Brothers Domaine DuPage pint  for $3.25 (my personal fav),  Goose Island 312 pint for $3.25 (hometown classic) , High Life Bottles for $3 (old school. tried &amp; true),  $4 Malibu Rum Drinks (classy), or Coors Light pitchers for $10 (go hard &amp; cheap!).

Had reservations for 6:00, joined their &#34;Guest Rewards Club&#34; online and received a $10 coupon, which we used on this tab.  Drinks- Lagunitas IPA, Bloody Mary (Absolut), Diet Coke. App- Potato Skins. Entrees- Meatloaf, Pot Roast (dinner not sandwich), Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.  Drinks were top notch, skins were B+ (I prefer buttermilk ranch over sour c side), Meatloaf was tasty but mashed potato side was smaller than hoped, Pot Roast was top notch, lean and melt-in-your-mouth tender, mashed potato serving small.  Buffalo Chix w/ fries was well received by our 18-year old.  Overall, the service was VERY speedy, with entree out just as skins were devoured.  There is a lot of stone on the walls in this place, so don&#39;t expect to carry on quiet conversation, as it is quite loud.  Also, if you drop a coupon, don&#39;t forget to tip your server based on the pre-discounted tab, since doing otherwise is unfair.  Server earned a 21% tip as she was competent, if a bit new on the job.  Other- I&#39;m no skinny-minnie, so if you are an, um, generously-proportioned individual, such as myself, do not get a booth unless someone of average/small size sits on the other side."

I had a side of the buffalo wing sauce for my chips and that was so tasty I can&#39;t wait to come back for the wings. I have one piece of constructive criticism: in the interest of efficiency and not making customers feel like they are sitting at an empty table, always bring water on your first trip to the table.

A group of 7 of us went to lunch today and while that is a decent sized group, the restaurant was not overly crowded.  We all ordered straight from the menu with no special orders.  Our food took a LONG time to arrive (about 15 minutes) and our server was quite absent.  We had to ask the hostess to find our server to tell her we needed our checks (we did separate checks).  I understand it takes longer to run separate checks, but the delay was not in the time to run the checks but in her even asking if we were ready for the check.

The food was good and there was a great beer selection (we could not partake) and this place has potential.  Be prepared for slow service when you go."

You can smell the wood fire through out the restaurant but the burgers are meh.  This restaurant is like Kim Kardashian, pretty on the outside but totally empty and clueless on the inside. The manager is stand offish and not friendly at all. Out toddler was in her stroller and he told us we had to park it at the front although she was at the point of almost dozing off. The restaurant was a ghost town with 3 tables out of 75 occupied on a Saturday afternoon. Our server was at the wait station cursing out a coworker like Dexter&#39;s sister Deb dropping the f bomb and the s bomb about 5 times. At least she was nice to us. The booths are narrow so ask for a table if you decide to go. We weren&#39;t too impressed and probably won&#39;t be back. 

One positive is their option to ask for a pretzel bun for any sandwich on the menu. Food came in a timely manner but it was a bit strange at how the Indian restaurant next to their location was packed with people as was Taco Bell across the street but this restaurant was empty with 3 times as many employees as patrons."

They insisted to play a soft core pop music list that nobody ever care about. &#34;We can&#39;t turn on the TV audio because we are playing the music.&#34; Common! It&#39;s a Monday afternoon and their business is slow and they can&#39;t cater the needs of most customers? Lame. Plus, they just lost a lot of potential business because none of the soccer watching crowd would ever return here for the rest of World Cup. 
Other than this borderline retarded, stubborn , arrogant management issue. I really don&#39;t have anything else against them. Ok environment and fair collection of beer, maybe because of their prime location in Schaumburg, they probably don&#39;t give a flying fuck about what customers want."

A lot of people complained about the prices, but dining in Schaumburg is a bit pricier than than the surrounding suburbs so it&#39;s not really unusual price-wise.

The most disappointing sandwich was the rib-eye steak sandwich. I expected it to be on french bread and thick but it was a thin slice in a sesame seed bakery bun.  The side of mashed potatoes was well seasoned with a nice consistency to it though.

The pot roast sandwich, bacon and egg burger, and BBQ burger were all competently done as well with a generous helping of fries.

I tried the creme brulee for dessert which came in a generous sized portion and had good flavor although it was slightly too sweet for me.

In general, the concept is good and the menu is complete, but it has the potential to be great with a bit better better execution."

My wife and I came here late, around 12:30 a.m. when not much was open.  After reviewing the menu we had decided that prime rib sounded absolutely delicious.  Knowing the intricacies of cooking prime rib, and the time we were ordering, we picked backups just in case.  When the waitress came to take our order I said to her &#34;We would like to share the 16oz prime rib but only if it is medium rare.  If you can&#39;t do medium rare then we   will order something else&#34;.  The waitress assured me we could get it medium rare and we were excited.

Prime rib came, looked pretty good.  The outside of the meat was medium rare but the guts, most of it, was medium to medium well.  We ate around the outside, it was late and we were hungry, and ate towards the middle as well.  When the waitress came back I showed her our concerns but let her know we were eating anyways because we were hungry.  She asked if we would like another piece and we were pleased with this so we agreed.

Our waitress came back a couple of minutes later &#34;I apologize, our cook says at this hour you received the most rare piece that we have&#34;.  Oh, that&#39;s too bad I though.  We decided not to get anything else as time was growing late.  Our waitress came back with the bill and informed us that because we were not satisfied with the prime rib that it was on the house!  I wasn&#39;t expecting that, a free beer or something would have been good for me!

Very attentive wait staff, extremely good customer service, and aside from the prime rib not being cooked to the proper temperature the seasoning was pretty good.  I will definitely give Stonewood Ale House another chance.  It is a great feeling to feel valued as a customer!  I hope they give me a reason to come back and change this to 5 stars!"

It was very crowded with families but we were only three so we got seated right away.

The menu is extensive for breakfast/lunch restaurant.  Every thing from Waffles to skillets of eggs and potatoes.

Since it was 11:00AM, they were serving both breakfast and lunch. I had scrambled eggs with cheese and fruit, Kathy had  soup and Tim had a skillet of eggs, vegetables and hash browns.

We all enjoyed our meals and the service.  When I asked  for hot sauce, our server told me the types they had and asked what one I would like. Nice touch.

I ordered a Turkey Club sandwich substituting coleslaw instead of fries. This comes with a soup which was New England Clam Chowder.
The soup was not anything special, just a thin version of this type of chowder. The turkey club was OK but would have been much better had they used real turkey instead of some type of deli style turkey. The sandwich was a bit of a challenge to eat, so I had to take out the middle piece of bread and some lettuce to be able to fit it in my mouth without dislodging my jaw.

Service was good and friendly, always a plus.

Cheers to All."

This is about as Greek family diner you can get! I will break my review down for you in categories:

Food: They always have a kick butt amazing homemade soup of the day! My absolute favorite, seriously I have tried to recreate and have come no where close, is their chicken and rice soup which they only have 2 days a week *sunday and Tuesday I believe* It is outstanding! so creamy and just the right amount of salt. I feel that I have tried everything on this menu at least once so I will narrow it down to a few favorites. the GREEK CHICKEN dinner... you just can&#39;t get anything better. Slow cooked chicken in a lemon base sauce with cooked lemon on top served with rice pilaf... holy cow just amazing and such a generous portion. Also the chicken picante is outstanding as well, very close to the chicken dinner but I am almost positive the chicken dinner is the staple on the menu where as the chicken picante is only on special every now and then- both similar dishes except the picante comes in a creamy lemon sauce where the chicken dinner is almost like a lemon vinaigrette. the TURKEY CLUB AND FRIES is the best club out there; huge portion and I am a big fan of their french fries. the FRENCH DIP is very good as well. DESERT- depending on what you order, most of the time you get a FREE desert with your order. I always ask for a sundae to my liking and they always make it extra special with hot fudge, whip cream, cherries, and two of those wafer cookies *it may have been my waitress who does this because she has known my family for so long, I would ask for those toppings if you want them so you aren&#39;t disappointed if it comes to the table without them.*

atmosphere: family diner. would be nice if it got some updates to the interior; for instance new booths and tables would be nice but the looks of the restaurant does not stop us from eating there. It has a bar up front where you can sit and eat as well. The deserts are displayed in a front window where they are kept cool and it is very enticing. 

service: The servers are really nice. We have been served by the same woman and she is really nice and sweet. No one wants a rude or pushy waitress and I believe you will not find that here! 

great food, great prices, HUGE menu. I recommend this place to anyone:)"

Good choice if you have a group unsure of what they want.

Lots of booth seating choices and a couple different rooms. The main room faces Rte14 and their very pretty rose gardens. I never feel crowded or rushed here, it&#39;s very comfortable.

Breakfast is served all day, but no poached eggs or waffles after 3. There is a 2x2x2 special that is not on the menu you have to ask for if you want a reasonable egg, bacon/sausage/pancake combo. Large salad choices, large menu, not expensive, not cheap.

The food here is ok and the place always seems spotless, but whenever I wind up here it is because all my preferred joints are closed. It&#39;s Greek run but nothing Greek that I really want like Mousaka.  I prefer Red Apple in Palatine for breakfast but they close at 3. The Continental in Buffalo Grove is a better option I think with an even larger menu and somehow always tastier. Cafe Fourteen has an ok breakfast but their lunch is meh and they close earlier than their posted 3pm.

A long time Palatine institution. A-OK"

What Greek style restaurant doesn&#39;t have yummy cream of chicken rice soup on Sunday? That was the one thing I was looking forward to and with the first spoonful I almost gagged.  it tasted like sour milk and I was informed they put lemon in it.  Took forever for our waitress to come back and I asked for a bowl of matzo ball soup instead. That was a bigger mistake. The broth looks yellow but it tasted like water and I don&#39;t know what they used to make the matzo ball with but it wasn&#39;t matzo meal. It had the texture and consistency of soap. And I thought i would try eggs hash browns toast and bacon. Any truck stop could do that. The bacon and toast was good, the eggs so so potatoes were nasty. When I paid the bill of almost 20 bucks for this horrendous meal and told guy you could tell he was thinking about taking something off but never did. I will never step foot in that place and I will warn others not to either. Pathetic."

From the get go the waitress was extremely cold and rude. When asked what saganaki was she responded with its flaming cheese (which it clearly says on the menu).  She refused to give me any further details on it... okay so I won&#39;t order that and moved on.  I decided to go with chicken parmesan pasta pretty safe bet I thought.  Was the worst thing I&#39;ve ever eaten.  It was super over cooked grilled chicken with mozzarella and what I can only compare to spaghettios sauce.  Everyone at the table sampled and agreed.  So I said I hate doing this but I really don&#39;t like this and would like something else.  The waitress rolled her eyes and said fine then what do you want.  I asked for the menu again so I can look through and she tossed one at me. I figured out my secondary option within a minute but she didn&#39;t come back for 20 minutes when everyone else had already finished their food.  So I said it took too long everyone&#39;s already done with their meal and she rolled her eyes again and just handed me the check!  And the worst part is when I went up to pay the manager asked how everything was and I said honestly pretty awful and he responded with &#34;oh well&#34; and then took my credit card and that was it!  Needless to say this will be my last visit here and I recommend everyone else stay away as well.

I live very close to this place. We&#39;ve gone 20+ times. I never thought to write a review because I&#39;ve done a lot for traveling, but not for walking distance from my home... (ooops.... should i have said that... hee hee hee).

I guess the fact that I&#39;ve gone 20+ times speaks volumes, right.

I will say that the place over-indexes on seniors (people over 65) - it appeals to that kind of crowd. Yet... also is very family friendly with children&#39;s menu, crayons, games etc...

Really... a solid family restaurant with a disproportionate share of greek dishes - and a place where you can feel comfortable, casual, and get a good meal. Doesn&#39;t matter whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner."

The Palatine Inn is our family&#39;s GO TO restaurant whenever we can&#39;t all agree on any other specialty restaurant.

I highly recommend you select from the daily special list which are always inserted in the middle of the menu.  There&#39;s are always selection of great entrees that will please the most critical palette ranging from a variety of meats to vegetarian delights.  Also, every dinner listed in the daily specials is inclusive of a great selection of delicious soups or salads, as well as a large variety of desserts ranging from ice creams to delicious cakes (I highly recommend the German Chocolate with a heap of whip cream) and pies; all on display.

Here&#39;s a hint for those who are 55+.  In addition to a great Senior Citizen section of the menu (same great dinners with full quantity of food, but offered at a much reduced price) the two main dinners offered on the daily specials are offered to Seniors at an additional discount.  

The food is scrumptious, the service is great, the restaurant is also inviting and clean, and the prices are always moderate to low.  My Final Hint ... Checkout &#34;linkedoffers.com&#34; for $5.00 coupons which are valid every day throughout the year.

The cooks aren&#39;t lazy here and it was prepared really good and consistent. I did pancakes instead of toast and I was stuffed. Im a big guy and can pack it away but this place gave me a run for my money. Which wasn&#39;t a lot.

They have your usual diner fare, as well as other dishes that go beyond the typical diner. One example is their grecian chicken, which is really great. You get several pieces of freshly broiled chicken in a yummy lemon sauce with a side of Greek potatoes, and soup or salad. I like their homemade soups, and I&#39;ve never gone wrong with some staples like pecan pancakes, and the turkey club. Someone mentioned the place seems old or run-down, and I disagree. While it&#39;s not by any means hip, the restaurant has a homey atmosphere, and you can tell it&#39;s filled with local families that have been coming for years. It&#39;s nothing fancy, but it has a local, no-frills feeling. Great family-run, local place to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner."

I&#39;ve been coming here for years with my parents and now my boyfriend and I go for at least coffee and dessert once a week.

This homey place is inviting and is a perfect mix of diner &amp; blue collar restaurant.

Let&#39;s start with service. While this place is usually fairly crowded, it doesn&#39;t take long to get seated because it&#39;s a pretty sizable place. Mary Ann is our favorite waitress and we usually request her. The other waitresses are all very nice and accommodating, she&#39;s just our favorite. :)

Their whole menu (which is BIG) is done well. There are nights where 4 of us go two get breakfast one gets an entree and one gets a salad and it all comes out great and hot (or the correct temperature) at the same time. You really cannot beat their prices on somethings and if an item is more than $10 you can be sure it&#39;s worth the money.

Recent favorites of ours include

The half slab rib dinner - Ribs, side, soup or salad and dessert for 13.95

I LOVE the jalapeno burger (I change the cheese to mozzarella instead of cheddar). It&#39;s the perfect amount of heat and you can tell they hand make the burgers because the peppers are mixed into the meat.

The turkey club is a great deal and can easily be split for two.

My dad usually loves whichever fish is on special.

Their breakfast items no matter what time of day or what you order are always great.

For dessert options, rice pudding, and their apple squares are phenomenal.

Definitely ignore the bad reviews and give Palatine Inn a try!"

I have lived in Palatine for eight months and it took me seven months to even notice it was there.  Anyhow, if you like the diners that have an old diner feel, this is the place to go.  The interior decor is a little outdated, which kind of brings a nice feeling to the restaurant.  The service was prompt, without any issues.  The food met expectations, and was priced accordingly.  I would probably go back here if I needed a quick bite for breakfast.

I am not sure how the lunch and dinner items are, but judging by the menu, it appeared that they had a huge selection.  I personally wouldn&#39;t go back for lunch or dinner, but I would go back for ice cream.  They have a pretty decent selection of desserts."

Everything here is dirty or rusty or old or all of the above. It clearly needs to be cleaned and updated.
The menu is equally uninspired, and worse, poorly executed. Because of the lack of options, I usually go with poached eggs. I mean, how can you screw up poached eggs? Well, you keep the shell on, of course.  Our waitress didn&#39;t even seem perturbed by it. I also had unripe tomatoes and tasteless turkey sausage. This place is overpriced, tasteless and bland. There&#39;s a pancake house down the street, a Baker&#39;s Square and a deli on the same avenue. Hell, there&#39;s a Burger King next door that probably has a cleaner interior and more menu choices.

I&#39;m a big fan of the Greek -style or homey diners every town boasts. Typically you find hearty, comfort food juicy burger platters filled with crisp fries and tureens of creamed soups. The menu and consistency pretty universal. 

Pulled in yesterday for lunch. First timer. And last timer. Experienced very poor service. For example, I had to hunt down our waitress for ketchup, multiple drink refills and napkins. When we complained about our food she just shrugged her shoulders in mock empathy, but did nothing to rectify it.

Speaking of food, my sister&#39;s pizza burger was dry (overcooked) and instead of dripping in meat sauce and mozzarella - the equivalent of a slice of cheese and a DRIZZLE of sauce adorned her burger. It was so scant on sauce that there was no meat clinging to it....as it should in meat sauce!

I ordered the Hungarian ghoulash. The description said strogonoff noodles, the picture showed strogonoff noodles......yet spaghetti noodles was what sat under my ghoulash. I couldn&#39;t wrap the meat around the noodles like I prefer nor did the gravy stick to the (supposed to be robust)  noodles; rather, it just slid off the skinny strands.

We did mention it to the manager who brought my sister extra sauce. Unknown to us till we were leaving, the manager put our entire tab on the house. That was very nice and most appreciated. The recovery was great. 

But in all honesty I just would have preferred a relaxing lunch buttressed by good service and good food."

My salad was so watery- and overpriced! $5 for a cup of salad? Come on!- so I only ate half. My fruit was dry and flavorless so I sent it back. Our waitress left much to be desired and wouldn&#39;t know friendliness if it bit her on the ass.

I should have listened to previous reviews that discussed lack of vegan/vegetarian options. I walk by this restaurant almost every day on my walks and there is always a substantial crowd. I figured it couldn&#39;t be too bad if so many people frequented the place. In fact, as I left there were about 30 people waiting to be seated.

Once the diners around me began eating I realized why so this place was always crowded. The garbage on their plates spoke for their taste in food. I was repulsed by some of the food I saw! One diner had a plate COMPLETELY soaked in some kind of white, thick, creamy gravy. 

Disgusting."

I think the best part of this restaurant is that they serve breakfast all day. My family loves breakfast for dinner. Also I highly recommend trying the chicken parmesan, and the veggie stir fry. Those are my favorite dishes. Their menu is very large, and there is definitely something for the whole family. 

I would recommend this place for somebody who wants a good homely meal for the family and doesn&#39;t want  to spend a lot. Definitely a child friendly restaurant."

I used to love this place and would crave their cream of chicken rice soup constantly - I even knew the days of the week they&#39;d rotate it in. It had that fabulous lemon flavor of a Greek soup mixed with the perfect chicken flavor and wonderful cream soup consistency. Sometimes it would have orzo instead of rice - both were fabulous! The other food was always great, too. 

Now don&#39;t get me wrong - they still serve up some good basic food. However, the cream of chicken soup drastically changed the past couple of years (and not for the better) - i don&#39;t even bother ordering it anymore. It is pretty much flavorless. No hint of lemon - and not much of any other flavor, either. As of late, the other food has been hit or miss for us, too. 

Also, we have had several experiences as of late with &#34;less than stellar&#34; service. 

It is unfortunate that something that was such a &#34;go to&#34; sure-thing-to-please-anyone kind of place has been on the decline with food and service. They aren&#39;t terrible - just not what they were. 

Hopefully they will start to &#34;fix&#34; some of these things and get back to what they were. In the meantime, our once regular trips have become less frequent for sure."

My dad lives in the area, and whenever I ask him if he wants to meet for lunch, this is where he suggests!  He loves it there, and who am I to judge Daddy&#39;s opinion?!

But I think the food here is pretty solid.  In most restaurants, you have to order a separate soup or side salad with your lunch or dinner meal, but here, it still comes with it.  The quality/quantity of the food is important nowadays!

Since their soups this past Saturday didn&#39;t sound very appealing, I was able to upgrade my soup to a salad for just $1.  Woohoo!!

But my hamburger was solid, and the fries were tasty.

I also like that each piece of bread in the bread basket is individually wrapped.  This means tons of people haven&#39;t touched it prior to my consumption (think about the &#34;Fecal Vision skit from SNL if you don&#39;t know what I am talking about).

I don&#39;t remember exactly what I got when I have gone with them for dinner but I do remember never being impressed. 

I went again today for breakfast, after visiting literally 3 other breakfast restaurants in the area only to find a full parking lot and no seating. Starving as I was, I decided to take a chance on the Palatine Inn just one more time. Who knows? Maybe their dinner doesn&#39;t paint an appropriate picture of what this restaurant has to offer! 

Wrong. 

I got the house skillet (broccoli, cauliflower, cheddar and two scrambled eggs) and it was really average. I would have been better off buying a bag of frozen veggies from Aldi and scrambling two eggs up at home - at least then the eggs wouldn&#39;t be mushy, cold and bland. It was a pretty disappointing meal, though I did try some of Girlfriend&#39;s pancakes and they were pretty delicious. 

Also, despite the fact that we went after breakfast hours we didn&#39;t receive a bread basket, which would have been nice considering how long the wait was on our food.

two skillets ended up being $20, which I thought was a little pricey for the quality, and quantity that we got. 

Not planning on going back here, I just am not a fan."

Our waitress was completely disinterested, and never brought the napkins and butter we requested.  We&#39;d been looking forward to the German chocolate cake to compensate, but no such luck.

I  thought the bread coming in plastic wrap was a good idea.. Cleaner. But why wrap dryed out bread, to keep it longer than a week? Being a Greek own business I thought I should stick with their special and had a gyro platter. Since I&#39;ve had gyros from every carry out in the northwest suburbs, I figure this is going to be good. Not! The meat was dry out and sat in a pool of oil.

I ordered a veggie skillet with wheat toast.  The toast was the driest, oldest toast I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant.  The skillet was good, but near the end i found a small piece of something that looked horribly like meat...  or dog poop...  or something else that didn&#39;t belong on my plate.  the worst part was the service.  the server must&#39;ve come directly from a funeral because she barely acknowledged us as humans, seemed bitter when we asked for anything like refills or condiments, and just overall seemed like a miserable person.

I&#39;m sorry thin crusts lovers, I typically don&#39;t like thin crust.  I want to feel like I&#39;m eating pizza.  I want to pick up a slice with substance and feel like I&#39;m eating something a little bread-y and not a hot cracker with cheese on it.  I don&#39;t want to hear &#34;crunch crunch&#34; when I bite into pizza, ever.  And what&#39;s the deal with square-cut pizza? Seriously, someone please explain this to me.  What&#39;s the point of this?  When you traditionally or pie-cut pizza, every slice for the most part is fairly equal in ingredients and size.  But when you start making the pizza look like like tiny bathroom tiles, then you end up with really large center pieces with 100% cheese and toppings with no crust and then the neglected, unloved, edge pieces/step children of the pizza where it&#39;s like 60% crunchy cracker and only 40% toppings around the edges.  Now I&#39;m no Pizzaologist, but I don&#39;t like those numbers. And be honest with yourselves folks, no one eats the edges, unless you&#39;re the sucker who stands in line first and has no choice.  Everyone else just gets the edge slices to be polite but deep down they just want to be pizza selfish and grab the giant, perfect, crustless &#34;slices&#34; in the middle like anyone with common sense.

So yeah, Mr. Beef&#39;s and Pizza was surprising.  The crust was soft and chewy and it DID NOT feel like I was eating a little cheese cracker snack, but a cheesy meal.  And believe me, they did not skimp on the cheese.  To make it even better, their sauce was light and actually tasted like tomatoes and not tomato paste.  There were some bites that actually had little chunks of tomatoes that weren&#39;t completely crushed in the sauce making process.  I love that!"

Anyways the fries were good, slightly crispy, and onion rings were nice, with a real onion, not minced onions. Had an odd malfunction with the fountain drink dispenser - it kinda exploded when I was trying to get my diet Pepsi some cherry syrup. Eh, oh well. I cleaned up and bit, picked up my food and went on my way.

Service was decently fast and food was good, just some foibles here. I&#39;ll be back for more."

Delicious. Being from Chicago I love a good beef sandwich and this did not disappoint. Everything was hot and yummy even the chocolate chip cookies were fresh and tasty.

Quality of ingredients: 10/10 cheese and tomatoes were soft as expected and crust had the perfect pop as you bit into it

Texture of pizza: 10/10 this pizza stays together when you&#39;re eating it despite it being served very hot and fresh

To go wrapping: pizza is served very hot even at 6:30PM. The pizza has plastic wrap to keep it from dripping or soiling the huge triangle box.

The pizza did not drip nasty grease all over, the balance of ingredients were on point, can&#39;t wait to try their deep dish on Thursdays."

I only met Mr Pizza as I didn&#39;t feel like an introduction with Mr beef was necessary.  A slice and a draft of MGD for about $6.99 with tax.  A large enough slice with tasty sauce and a frozen pint of beer.  It was good.  Good za slices are hard to come by in this area.  Yes there are a number of businesses that sell pizza but not many sell decent slices.

Their slices are thin crust with that bread crumb powdered bottom.  Pastry type with a nice chew and tasty sauce with a crispy crust.  Any slice on hand is a mere $3 dollars.  

The place would remind you of 70s era diners with pink neon and vinyl booths.  The kind of place small children would find intriguing.  Speaking of children, this location has a separate party room that could seat forty with arcade classics.  One detail not known to the public is that they have a drive-thru.

I don&#39;t intend to pick on the other reviewers here, but I&#39;m unsure why this place hasn&#39;t gotten better reviews (what&#39;s their beef about this place)... I&#39;ve only had terrific experiences here at Mr Beef. Their Italian beef tastes great, as do their fries... I would only recommend ordering a side of their gravy because one may want &#39;more&#39; than what they put on standardly. Perhaps their brand of hot peppers (Hot Giardiniera) could be better, but that&#39;s okay. Their sweet peppers are very good. 

Perhaps, maybe they may be a little more expensive than other beef places around, but not by much, but the other places aren&#39;t as good... The person taking the order have always been friendly &amp; helpful, taking money and handing over the food.

A few of us come here pretty regularly and have tagged along a couple times. The first time I went was because I had a craving for Gyros. They were very good. The pita was fresh, and the meat was pretty decent. Their fries- I could go either way. They are not my favorite.

I have tried their fried shrimp, it&#39;s just frozen fried shrimp from what I can tell. It comes with a salad and the last time, it was pretty pathetic; wilted and such.

I have ordered their grilled chicken sandwich a few times and it&#39;s pretty good. Not a lot of flavor, though. I really order it because its on days I need some protein. I&#39;m almost tempted to put salt on the chicken, but refuse to because thats so bad! :) I would like it if they put some seasoning or marinaded the chicken breasts.

I can&#39;t complain about the food not being fresh....that is not an issue here (minus the frozen stuff). 

Their service is good. The food gets prepared pretty quickly and they keep the tables pretty clean. 

Another plus is they offer a caffeine free diet cola (pepsi)! Not a huge fan of pepsi products, but it&#39;s caffeine free and diet, so I can&#39;t complain. This is hard to find at any restaurant. Glad they caught on!

Word of warning: if you like your beef juicy, ask for the au jou on the side (which they&#39;ll happily do) because otherwise they&#39;ll REALLY make it wet. Of course some people like it running down their arm, in which case get it wet. I also recommend the cheese and green peppers.

I&#39;ve had their pizza a couple times, but the rest of the family gets it a lot and it&#39;s a solid 7 out of 10. Also, the kids love their kids meals which are a good deal - come with plenty of fries - and come in a little cardboard 1950s car.

Speaking of kids: totally family friendly. They&#39;ve had some excellent magic shows there, completely free. I&#39;m talking 6 or 7 magicians over nearly a couple of hours. It&#39;s off to the side in a party room. Again, the kids love that. They also love the video game arcade and the claw that grabs stuffed animals...that sort of thing. It&#39;s cheap entertainment for kids 10 and under for sure.

Have had a party in the party room too, and it was pretty reasonable with about 50 people getting plenty to eat and beer as well.

Final tip: their kiddie spaghetti comes with a good meatball and garlic bread and is very reasonable. For adults who don&#39;t have a huge appetite, it&#39;s a great buy and they won&#39;t card you even if you look over 10yrs old.

I ordered the large beef&#39;s, baked chicken, mostaccioli, about 80 plus cupcakes (different flavors) and the key lime bars. I can not say it enough how GREAT the food was/is!!! So many guests came up to me during the shower asking who catered the food. I recieved several calls the next day asking where are they located. The Mother of the Bride MADE me order more of the key lime bars today!! 

I will be placing more catering orders for my upcoming events on Aug 2nd &amp; 9th of this year. I live all the way in Berwyn with hundreds of resturants all around me and I will continue to use Mr. Beefs!! This is my #1 pick by far. 
Can&#39;t forget to mention how extremely nice and kind all the owners are. Customer service is by far important and they provide the best!!

Too much cheese overall and a little to greasy for me.  However I loved the cheese fries.  They are softer than I am sure some like but for me I enjoy when u need a fork because they are so engulfed in the cheese and are a little mushy.  

Pretty much your typical beef and hamburger place, 50&#39;s diner kind of feel.  Huge dining area.

2.5 stars would have been my choice but I always like to round up - overall good not great, no Portillos or Johnnies, but better than Buona for sure

The food was tasty, the service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere is tough to beat. 
The only downside would be the cost but my serving was huge. 

What I found particularly cool was I told the cashier that I had never been here before and I wasn&#39;t sure if a gyro was the route I wanted to go - he immediately offered to bring me a few pieces of the gyro meat to see if I liked the taste before ordering. I was surprised and impressed. 

The menu is pretty large. As you could guess, they&#39;re known for their beef (cheesy beef!) and pizza. There are a lot of other choices and not all of them deliciously deep fried.

Well I was waiting in line and the guy in frontof me ordered two packs of friest and a beef special. He spent around $20 on that... I spent about $10 for Italian beef, small fries, and NO drink. They also charge you for the gardedas.

I tried the italian beef and it was probably the most flavorless thing I have ever tasted. Italian beef is very flavorful and this tasted like they dipped it in hot water then hot oil. I also was not to crazy about the portion either.. It was the size of a TI-84 calculator with little beef in it.

The fries seemed like your average cheap frozen fries. Thus the fries were over priced. The small carton didn&#39;t help either and the flavor of the fries weren&#39;t amazing. 

I would probably not come here again because it is a waste of money. I generally don&#39;t say &#34;waste of money&#34; but this place is geuinely wasting your money. I recomend you go a distance and go to Mr. Pubs (Near the first McDonald)  if you are just looking for good food."

This may not look off-hand like a good party place but it is AWESOME.  Rich, the manager I guess, is about the nicest person I&#39;ve ever encountered anyplace and was so helpful.  They let us arrive 1/2 hour early to decorate and let us hang around an extra 1/2 hour as we trickled out since there wasn&#39;t another party afterward.  EVERYBODY LOVED THE PIZZA.  They served all we could eat along with all the salad we could eat and all the pop we could drink and were completely unstingy, keeping the table loaded with food and drink the whole time we were there and supplying us with tons of leftover boxes to take the extras home!!  They were also very unobtrusive as they refilled everything, it was like magic!  They allowed us to bring in a TV to play a tribute to my husband.  They told me several times that I could leave all of our garbage behind, torn wrapping paper, used dishes and decorations (how many times will you use those 50 year old decorations??) etc.  They allowed us to bring in our own bday cake and supplied free coffee, cups, and serving ware.  The serving tables were all covered and had table skirts.  Plus, when they new the amount of people we would have, they had the tables prepared with appropriate seating.  

I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a casual party for 50 or fewer people (we had about 45.  It was a LITTLE tight, but there is an additional sitting area attached to the main party room.

There is a stage where they put the serving tables that still has plenty of area for someone to stand and MC (we even crowded about 20 guys up there for a little contest of sorts).  

Plus the food is genuinely good and ALL the servers and employees we encountered were friendly and helpful.  Finally, THE PRICE IS RIGHT!!!!!!"

My buddy recommended this place because he&#39;s eaten here before &amp; said the food was good.  I ordered a cheeseburger, cheese fries &amp; a cup of water, my total was $8 &amp; change.  As I waited for my food to come out, I kept looking at my receipt. $4.90 for the burger, $2.50 for the cheese fries, $0 for the water.  When my food  was ready, I almost laughed when I saw how little food was on the tray.  The burger was a 1/3 lb but looked smaller than a quarter pounder from McD&#39;s &amp; had no flavor.  The cheese fries were good, but you need to use a fork since cheese is poured on the fries &amp; they&#39;re a mess to eat.  Next time, I would try ordering fries with a side of cheese since the fries were good, but got soggy after a while of sitting in liquid cheese.  I was surprised to only see about 7 people in the place on a Friday night, but maybe this is more of a lunch destination.  I was a little disappointed at how little food I got for the price I paid, but that&#39;s the risk I take for getting a burger at a place that specializes in other things.  I&#39;ll try some pizza next time if I decide to stop in"

I don&#39;t expect chit-chat, but even when there are no cars behind me - they move you through as if they are being timed. The girl working it today couldn&#39;t muster a &#39;hello&#39;, nor a smile.  Again, there was no line &amp; no reason to rush me.

I myself am 43. Everyone left full and happy. We ordered the largest thin crust pepperoni pizza on the menu which we got for 1/2 off thanks to an Entertainment Book coupon. It was huge so we did end up taking some home but not as much as you might think. My grandson is a pizza fiend and he ate 10 pieces. (Not a typo). This kid loves pizza.

My niece opted for the Italian Beef which looked great and she said was delish. She ordered it dipped with extra gravy on the side but it came dry plus they forgot the gravy. They got us some right away when we went back. She had cheese fries too which I sampled and they were as yummy as any cheese fries I&#39;ve ever had. Drinks are free refills you get yourself so the kids drank a gallon or so each. 

Since there are no waitresses you save on tipping so between that and the coupon we got a great deal for four people plus enough pizza leftover for my grandson&#39;s dinner. Since the service was slow and our order was wrong I knocked off a star. The lady who took my order at the register  looked bored and didn&#39;t know how to credit me for the discount so she had to call someone over and seemed irritated for the trouble. She also added an extra order of fries in her confusion over my niece&#39;s cheese fry decision but they looked so good we kept them. 

The parking is ample and easy to access. They have outside seating too and beer on the menu. The decor is cheezy but who cares? It was clean. Good place for kids. My friend gave me her Entertainment Book coupon so I&#39;m going back for sure."

Items ordered:  2 steak sandwiches, a gravy bread and fries.

My steak sandwich had Nothing, nothing on it, no lettuce, tomato, etc. That would not really be so terrible if it were a good steak sandwich.  It was thin and the meat  was low quality and/or borderline on freshness.  My companion got the same thing, only on garlic bread.  I think that made his a tad better than mine.  No sauce on the side, just bread and meat and no good meat at that!

Fries- good. Gravy bread good.  I was hopeful this was like the Mr. Beef (On Harlem) that serves a kick-ass steak sandwich. Sadly, it is not!"

I&#39;ve been going to Mr. Beef &amp; Pizza for years, close to 20 to be honest, and it&#39;s a pretty decent place for pizza, beef, dogs, gyros, etc...  The food is about average for the type of restaurant that it is.  As for the pizza, it&#39;s definately better than cardboard!

There&#39;s also a party room that&#39;s great for kids birthday parties, family parties, team celebrations, etc... We had my daughters first and second birthday parties there and just had our kids&#39; combined birthday parties there this weekend.  In the past, our friends have always enjoyed the pizza.  Personally, I&#39;m board with pizza at the moment (have a 3 yr old son who would live on it, given the opportunity), so we had lunch by the head for the party.  We had Beef, Mostoccolli, potatoe salad, garden salad, mozzeralla sticks, fried mushrooms, onion rings and fresh veggies... we got a TON of compliments on the location and the food.  The price, for 45 people to eat, was actually pretty good.  The party room has games and plenty of room to set up activities for kids.

I&#39;ll continue to have my kids parties there as long as they continue to enjoy it and we&#39;ll stop by there every now and then because the food is good and the atmosphere is comfortable, regardless of age.

Oh, on a side note, they also do what Flukey&#39;s used to do with the old cars coming out on the weekends in the summer and they do slot car races over the summer too.

Yes, much of that activities are geared towards kids, but that doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that it&#39;s actually a pretty decent place to grab a dog and cheese fries on a Saturday afternoon if you happen to be in the neighborhood."

I&#39;m 5 foot 9, 160 lbs with a ferocious appetite. My one friend is 6 feet tall and weighs about 185 lbs and my other friend is about 5 foot 5 at about 220lbs. You can see, we&#39;re heavy eaters.

We ordered the Mr. Beef Deluxe deepdish. It sounded appetizing enough. Cheese, green onions, olives, tomatoes, sausage, BACON, etc....how can you not try it? the guy at the register told us it would take about 30 minutes. so while we waited we got ourselves an order of cheese fries to keep us busy.

as promised, 30 minutes later, register man comes out with our pizza. sets it down, and the three of us devoured the beauty that sat in front of us. the large, 14 inches if i remember, was plenty to feed three hungry young men. with our stomachs full and pizza pan empty with nothing but uneaten crusts, we realized that for less than 25 bucks, we had a great meal which was well worth the short 30 min wait.

of course if you want some great pizza, u should try lou&#39;s. but for good pizza at a cheap price to share amongst three fatties, this place does a good job.

the interior makes it a fun and relaxing place to sit back and have a nice conversation. added plus cause they serve beer. i mean come on, whats better than pizza and beer after a swim meet?......well, deep dish pizza and beer!"

Really good cheese fries here too.  They have large fries and douse them in cheddar cheese (much better than the places that give you &#39;shoestring fries&#39; and a tiny cup of cheese).

From the outside, the place looks sketchy. Once you walk it, it&#39;s crowded with a lot of families with kids running around. It&#39;s crowded because of the value - you get your money&#39;s worth for the price. I was expecting worse because of the appearance but I was pleasantly surprised. The fried chicken was crispy and seasoned well and the variety was plentiful. There were only a few sushi items to choose from but there were plenty of other dishes that stood out. The crawfish boil was also surprisingly good - the broth was spicy and unlike any crawfish that I&#39;ve had before. 

I got my money&#39;s worth after devouring five plates of food. It&#39;s surprising that they are still in business because you are getting much more food for the price you pay. Haters are going to hate but you can&#39;t deny that you are getting more than what you pay for."

They seem to be a chain as I was fairly certain I had eaten at a similarly named place before, but I was hungry enough to decide to stop in and give it a try.

The first thing I noticed was how crowded it was. Both the parking lot and the inside of the restaurant itself were jam packed. The number of little kids there might lead one to believe this was a combination Chuck E Cheese/Toys R us disguised as an Asian restaurant. If it&#39;s this crowded it has to be good right?

Once I got over to the buffet area I noticed a huge line of people queued up to get food at the Hibachi. Not wanting to wait behind 15 other people I sorted through what was out at the actual buffet. Pretty much everything I took back to my table was subpar, I got cheese wontons, various types of chicken and nothing stood out to me as being good. Realizing there had to be a reason for the long line at the Hibachi I got in the very long line and waited.

The Hibachi here works a bit differently than some other places with them cooking four or five peoples plates at a time. They had a pretty good selection of things to add such as noodles, rice, eggs, imitation crab, shrimp, other meats, mushrooms and so forth. After about 15 minutes of waiting my food was finally on the hibachi. The process for cooking all five orders at a time isn&#39;t fast either. I&#39;d say each group of five plates takes about 10 minutes for them to cook. After around 30 minutes I was back at my table with a plate of hot food in hand. Now, it would be time to find out if it was worth the wait.

Everything was very well cooked, the choices of spices and oils they added worked very well. The eggs mixed with the noodles made a very good combination, the meat was well cooked. I was very pleased with the outcome of the food from the Hibachi and had the time it takes to get food from the Hibachi not been so long I might have gone for a second plate.

Overall I was pleased with the food off the grill from Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet. The actual buffet food wasn&#39;t so hot.  If you&#39;re willing to spend the time waiting for the grill (or go on a less busy day), it&#39;s definitely worth the price if you like grill food. I&#39;m going to give this place a solid four stars and would definitely return here."

Never eat the mac and cheese, so much cheese i&#39;ll get so much cheese stuck on my throat. some of the fruit is old all the time. 

Overall this place is excellent, put what can you expect its a fucking buffet. you get what you pay for. :D"

Without high expectations this place was not bad and not good either. There is definitely a interesting mixture of food typical of asian buffet. The ones that come to mind are fried shrimp, real tough roast beef that you cut yourself, a grill where you give the chef a bowl of items you want stirfried, they can also cook slices of beef on the grill but often overdone, very small sushi poorly wrapped and sashimi of unknown fish. What I do enjoy are the fried chicken drumsticks, steamed clams, mac and cheese, salt and pepper shrimp, and the sweet and sour chicken. You get what you pay for which is why it is so cheap. I would come on a weekday, less busy and no lines. The other cool plus is they did away with the self service ice cream and have the little ice cream cups.

I will bet you anything that they serve the food from the night before as well. When we tried their the first time it was actually pretty good. But as my family starting going their more and more often we just got sick of it. I literally wanted to throw up. Anyways the prices are just ok. The service is ok and the staff is ok.  I really don&#39;t have anything to say because their dishes is god awful!!! I am really surprised all these reviews are wonderful. If your looking for a good Asian restaurant I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! Try Royal Buffet on Golf and Roselle Road. The food at least their isn&#39;t disgusting!!!

I went here on a whim and I have to say everything about this place sucks except the price. 

Here are some examples:

The Atmosphere: 

Table was sticky, booth was torn on both sides, even the iced tea the waitress brought me was warm with all the ice melted. 

The Food:

Crawfish: were small and clearly dirty and not purged. 

Crab: small and  not cleaned

Salt and Pepper Shrimp: small and had huge black veins in all of them. 

Beef dishes: the beef was clearly spoiled and left a rotten meat after taste. 

Egg rolls/Spring Rolls: Soft and not crunchy at all. 

Wonton Soup: Giant wontons with very little filling and thick pasta-like wrapper that disintegrated after I touched it with a spoon. 

Stuffed Shrimp: Stuffing had no taste and the shrimp was tiny with a massive black vein. 

Hibachi: Food looks like its been left out to spoil all day. 

That was about all I tried before deciding to leave to avoid food poisoning. 

The Service: Decent because I did a decent job of serving myself. 

Conclusion: Don&#39;t come here unless you are desperate for calories because your money would be better spent at Portillos next door."

Most things are definitely on the greasy side but I enjoy the foods they have here. 

My favorites include the mac n cheese, beef broccoli with lo mein, BBQ Ribs (not very asian I know but it is well seasoned and tasted very good), chicken wings (its good when its piping hot and fresh out of the fryer!), crab ragoon, fried shrimp, steamed clams, this egg puffy sweat bread, and the ice cream!

I always mix two ice cream flavors together (for example, strawberry and vanilla to make strawberry cream or orange sherbet and vanilla to make creamsicle). Yes I know, so creative. :]

Service is very quick and there are waiters and waitresses always passing by to clear the tables very quickly. It does seem like a waste to have to wash so many dishes but they keep it sanitary by not allowing used plates to re-enter the buffet line in case of contamination. 

There is plenty of parking around this grill and it is very children friendly. I have been to this place twice and this specific location is much better than other Hibachi grills because of the variety it offers."

Customers seemed rude and just cut in front of you when you are about to get food. Also, when the good food comes out, it seems like vultures swoop in and pile there plates up a foot high where the tray that was just brought out is gone within a couple minutes. 

There is a lot of greedy people where they seem to think food is scarce or maybe they think that if they bought food like shrimp in the store it would cost a lot, so they stock pile their plates trying to take advantage of the value? 

Overall, the place is dirty where the floor was sticky and food is very greasy. I didn&#39;t eat a whole lot of it or didn&#39;t join the bandwagon of being a pack of hyenas when food came out because I knew it would not sit well with me later due to the greasiness. Sushi rolls were also so small and was a D- just passing as sushi."

This place is pretty great.  Huge seafood selection.  Hollandaise sauce-like mussels, flavorful crawfish, salt and pepper shrimp, fried squid, clams, sushi.... this place has got it all.

Their barbecue ribs and chicken are also pretty good. -- i have yet to try the hibachi station.

What really makes this place great is how affordable it is. At most, it&#39;s about $10 per person.  SO affordable!

This buffet is clean and you can tell they try and make sure the food is quickly refilled and kept fresh. 

My only gripe is that the sushi was cold- i mean, it was like it was made overnight and just taken out of the fridge kind of cold.

But overall, really good. As with all buffets, some Items are hit and miss. I kind of like that the ice cream is in individual packages, but i do love me some soft serve too.

Absolutely worth checking out."

The prices are super reasonable for the amount of food, ~$7 for lunch. At least some of the food will be a hit.

But let&#39;s be real, there is another reason to go. Seeing the labels that got lost in translation. It&#39;s a humorous little scavenger hunt. Perhaps you can find the &#34;beef sannwich&#34;, &#34;Itallian noodles&#34;, or the infamous &#34;Franch dressing&#34;.

But they&#39;ve always held a certain fun appeal for me since childhood. The freedom of choice and a plethora of selection with the prospect of finishing the meal with desserts. Coming back to your table with your plate of food selection. Seeing what your dining buddies voluntarily choose to eat &amp; how much. I like the casual ambiance of a buffet too. The downside is that you can&#39;t bring home leftovers. When I go to a sit-down restaurant, I usually box leftovers, essentially halving my meal cost. Then there is quality control, along with sanitation.

When I go to a buffet, I try to select little amounts of items that pique my interest. An amateur would pile food, yet leave behind a lot of leftovers when the server takes away the plate. I feel too guilty doing that. So at this buffet, I got to sample a lot of dishes (I avoided the sushi station). Of all the items that I tried, I liked the chicken drumsticks the best; they reminded me of Korean gampoongi. The sauce was spicy and reminiscent of gochujang, spicy Korean chili paste. Crispy and non-soggy. Good size to them.

I also liked their fruit selection. Wasn&#39;t impressed with their desserts.

The only reason I would come back to this place would be for their chicken drumsticks. YUM!"

The soups were actually really good and the rest of the food was pretty decent.  they also had a pretty decent dessert selection along with self-scoop ice cream (altho this concerns me a bit that everyone was scooping their own ice cream and the dirtiness of it all, but I guess it is a buffet...)

they also have a hibachi grill but all the cook there does is grill up your meats and veggies with some sort of butter sauce and no other options for sauces.  we had shrimp on our plate and the shrimp did not come out fully cooked.

The wait staff was pretty attentive to our drink needs and to clearing off our finished plates.

overall, the food was ok, and for the price of $10 a person, it&#39;s really hard to beat that."

Plenty of choices including sushi, soup, American staples (mac and cheese, pizza), typical Chinese dishes (Sweet and Sour Chicken, Beef and Broccoli, etc).  Nothing was disgusting (yes, there is plenty of grease in some of the fried options), but I was never disappointed.

The interior is not the best, but who really cares when you are eating for $9.95 (or in our case $6.95--they always have coupons in Saver Magazines).  Our table was always quickly cleaned and they were quick on Pop re-fills.

If you are looking for a quick and cheap meal, this is definitely a place to stop at... but if you want something a little more elegant I suggest you hit up another restaurant."

- Sushi (3/10)

- Soups (5/10)

Reviewing a buffet is weird. There&#39;s so many places to touch on, but I guess I&#39;ve already done one before for Crazy II Buffet, which this is almost an exact replica of, so I guess I&#39;ll just keep going.

MAKE YOUR OWN STIR FRY
Just like Crazy II Buffet, not enough stuff. I&#39;m spoiled with Flat Top Grill, but just the vegetable choices here are so slim. The worst part of it all, is that I have no control over the sauces. The guy behind the stove does. Maybe I&#39;m just a control freak. I&#39;d like to say that you should pass this, but it&#39;s such a big part of the place, that you&#39;re sorta gimping your experience if you do. Blah, whatever.

SUSHI
I&#39;d say that this sushi is about on par with Todai, which isn&#39;t saying alot. The choices are very slim (maybe 5-6), and no sashimi, but the only thing that&#39;s good about theirs is that they don&#39;t pack every roll in a boulder of rice. However, you know that the rice has &#34;been around&#34; for a while by the way it comes off. Even the &#34;freshly made&#34; sushi have rice that sort of falls off in hard sheets. I guess you paid for it, might as well have some.

CHINESE FOOD
There is nothing special about their China Buffet. Nothing. It&#39;s your run of the mill Chinese food. Orange Chicken, Kung Pao, Mongolian Beef, etc. 

SOUPS
Egg Drop and Hot &amp; Sour. Both are run of the mill too. Interestingly enough, they have a &#34;Broccoli Cheese&#34; soup, which is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen that at an Asian buffet. It sort of...has no taste. It&#39;s textured like Broccoli Cheese, but tastes like...nothing. Sorta like how grits, you can vaguely get a hint of corn, you can vaguely get a hint of broccoli. Add a pinch or 2 of salt, and sort of like Grits, it goes down. At first I thought it was disgusting and put it aside, but I kept eerily spooning more and more of it, even though it was depressed sitting in the &#34;discard pile.&#34;

WELL?
Considering that Super China Buffet is in our list of weekly lunch destinations, there&#39;s no reason that Hibachi Supreme Buffet can&#39;t be in it either. It&#39;s not like the food&#39;s inedible, it&#39;s just very run of the mill. If it closed down, I wouldn&#39;t cry."

Considering I always see a line out the door, I&#39;m hoping for the latter. I took my son last night and we were seated without a word other than, &#34;What to Drink?&#34; and not informed that was extra cost to have a drink.

We only ate from the buffet because the items for the grill were so unbelievably limited....I didn&#39;t see the point. The weird thing about this place is that the food looks awesome, but then you eat it and in general your first thought is, &#34;Why does it all taste the same?&#34;

Honey Chicken
General Tso&#39;s Chicken
Sweet and Sour Chicken
ANY CHICKEN
All tasted the same. 

The meats - like the tenderloin, prime rib, etc. HARD AS A ROCK.

For the price you get a very good selection. And to top it off, ever since they opened, they have added new options in their buffet every week. (We go every Sunday)  I&#39;m always excited to see what new dish they have for surprise, but I won&#39;t mind if they didn&#39;t. Food quality is more than average. I love the hibachi rice and dragon fish. Many &#39;good&#39; selections. And you can even have your own stir fried noodles by picking the ingredients you want and have the guys cook it. Dessert is also wonderful. Good selection. The ice-cream for one is not that boring soft serve. You get decent ice cream that you scoop. A lot of flavors to choose from to. And cheese cake....yum. It&#39;s simple but just think of what you paid!

When we get here, it&#39;s always packed. Service from many of the waiters/waitresses them selves is very good. Good job &#39;Sky&#39;. The ones in pink, (hostesses?) aren&#39;t very pleasant and could work more on their interaction skills...

I went with my husband and girlfriend and they had to politely spit out their food and push their plates away.

Beware if you eat here you may just end up at your neighborhood emergency room. Just a side note. When my father told the nurse where he had dinner she said... Ah we see a lots of people come through here that have ate at that buffet.

Not only the food, but the people who eat there are animals. They jump all over you when you are putting food on your plate and act like this is the last meal they will ever eat. Service sucks, too. You practically have to have a giant mound of plates on your table for them to take them away. Don&#39;t go anywhere near the sushi, either. That is nasty, too. The only thing they have going for them is that they are the only buffet near me that offers the sugar doughnuts, which are awesome.  I would recommend going here if you want some serious people watching, because that is PRIME! Last night, there was a woman in Daisy Dukes, a black lace t-shirt, black wedges, and had tattoos all up and down her thighs. Not even cute/cool tattoos, tattoos of a police badge and a bat."

First consider the dinner price of $10 and a wide selection of Chinese dishes plus a small American style bar and custom hibachi grill AND a sushi station. For $10!! 

I hate buffets and I only go if I&#39;m really hungry and whoever I&#39;m with either pays for it or insists upon it so for me to give a buffet 3 stars is like giving a regular restaurant 5 stars.  Service is friendly and the hibachi cook can&#39;t speak a lick of English but everyone manages somehow. The price cannot be beat for the large selection and I didn&#39;t see anything particularly disgusting except for one woman who reached for some maki with her bare hands. Food is kept fresh and there are single serving ice cream cups for desert (among other things) so I was happy for the price.

A must try if you&#39;re in the area, have a ravenous appetite, and don&#39;t want to spend a fortune on food."

The environment was meh. The only good thing was the price. It was a little less than $10 a person. They have the typical selection of asian buffet food. The food tasted cheap...like leftovers from the day before =X. Nothing stood out. The Hibachi grill wasn&#39;t good. The steak was bad. There was a small selection of sushi, none of which were good. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We were seated right away. We went on a Sunday night. There was probably a total of 20 people there. The place was alright. It looked like an Old Country Buffet in there. Nothing great. If you want cheap asian buffet food that tastes as much as it&#39;s worth, this is the place to go."

You can tell because the reviewers have no friends, no picture, and the only reviews they wrote was a negative short sentence for Hibachi. I understand that another Chinese buffet opening right next to you might be a threat, but seems a little low to be trying to destroy the reputation of another place just because they opened up next to you. Right when Hibachi opened, the China Buffet which has never done anything different in the last 5 years all of a sudden had a $4.99 lunch special.

1. The host greeted us when we came in and said goodbye to us when we left. We were seated almost immediately when I went in on a weekday during lunchtime. the waitstaff seemed a little overwhelmed but the plates were mostly picked up quickly and the staff asked us pretty often if we needed anything.

2. the sushi selection is a little weak and was nothing too impressive in my opinion. just a few common rolls and i was a little disappointed they didn&#39;t have anything with eel as they usually have caterpillar rolls or uni q rolls at similar buffets like &#34;crazy buffet&#34; in elk grove.

3. the hibachi part had a selection of different vegetables and meats. It seems as if the hispanic cook is a little more experienced than the asian one. it seemed as if the hispanic cook spiced and oiled the foods by himself. with the asian guy, i noticed the customers had to tell him what they wanted on the stir fry or he would just cook it very plain. 

4. the chinese food buffet area was very fresh and hot. The fried foods were crispy, the chinese food was decent, and the salad/fruit area was fresh. I think this was the best part of this buffet. they have some desserts and 8 diff types of ice cream also if you&#39;re looking for something after.

5. The price is probably the main reason I like this place and I will keep going. the price is very cheap for the amount of food and quality you get here. I mainly go during lunchtime and with tax and tip it usually is less than $10 per person to get filled up. 

The place is packed most of the time i&#39;ve been here or passed by with a mainly hispanic and asian crowd. I just hope that the quality of the food stays as fresh as it has been for this first month."

It was grand opening weekend, the place was packed.  The wait was reasonable, but the food, not so much.

When I sat down, we ordered our drinks.  That cost extra, not included in the buffet price.  Then I went to the buffet line.  I was expecting from fresh food hot food from the kitchen, when I got to the buffet line, I was disappointed.  Everything was picked at and scraps were left.  The so-called prime rib was cut in thick slices, it was extremely tough to eat.  Along with that, the wait-staff seemed very unorganized.  It took me 4 tries to ask for some knives for the tough meats.  

The hibachi grill is a good idea, but this place is nothing but the typical Chinese buffet.  The sushi is very limited selection.  

With that said...  unfortunately, I will not be returning to Hibachi Grill &amp; Supreme Buffet after this first visit.  Extremely disappointed.  I do not recommend coming here.  There are better Chinese buffets around town that are around the same price with better quality food."

I didn&#39;t eat here, but after what my parents told me, I felt so bad.

They had one of their date nights and they decided to eat at Hibachi Grill. 
My parents had dragon fish salmon, sweet &amp; sour soup, pot stickers and sushi.

Maybe an hour later, they told me they felt sick and ended up being in the bathroom for the rest of the day.

The problem with buffets that have sushi as one of the entrees, is a bad idea to have. Sometimes, if the who platter isn&#39;t finished, they won&#39;t replenish them right away and it could be hours. 

So before you want sushi...i would recommend going to a restaurant the makes fresh sushi. I&#39;m not sure about the other entrees they had, but I am disappointed with this place and mad for making my parents sick."

My boyfriend and I always see people coming in and out of this place with it&#39;s parking lot always full. We went in here earlier today to try it out for lunch. Sushi is horrible. It all pretty much tasted the same and was pretty dry. The sushi I buy at UIC was way better than this. The shrimp tasted pretty fishy, the clams were ok. Mostly all of the food selection was sub par. This included orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, honey chicken, prime rib, governor tso&#39;s, crab ragoons, onion rings, mac and cheese, chicken on a stick, mushrooms, etc. We tried a little bit of everything except for the pork loin (I think. . .it was by the prime rib) cuz we found a hair in it :/ . Even the desert was ehh, nothing special.

Would I come back? No.

Would I recommend this place? No.

I&#39;ll give it one star for being only 7 bux for lunch. One star for the selection. 

Oh and their music selection, a backstreet boys cd playing quietly in the background.

I really enjoy the tempora rolls. Another favorite of mine is the shreaded beef Hibachi. They actually make it spicy when I ask.  The dinning room here is large but does fill up.

The buffet is extensive, with a good mix of Japanese, Chinese and American cuisine.  All very fresh and hot.  Food we tried was delicious.

I am a vegetarian now, so I did not get to try the sushi, but it looked fresh and well presented.   The sushi was in it&#39;s own section, next to the hibachi grill and attended by the chef.  I was amazed it was included in the buffet, as I know how expensive going out for sushi can be.

The hostess and rest of the staff were very nice, friendly and polite.  They kept refilling our glasses and asking if we needed anything.  Very good service.

The place was impeccably clean and they had quite a few staff making sure it stayed that way.

I believe they are part of a franchise and they just opened the Streamwood location (Same area as Sam&#39;s Club, next door to Applebees).

The prices absolutely rocked.   I paid $17 for two people including drinks.

I almost got greedy and kept this little place a secret, but I guess if I wanted it to stay open, I need to share.  I most definitely go back."

To start the host just plopped us at our table with no explanation. 
Half the food wasn&#39;t marked so you couldn&#39;t tell what it was.

When we asked what was what for the sushi the guy just starred at us for about 30 seconds than turned to continue making whatever he was making. (frankly, I&#39;m sure he on spoke Spanish &amp; had no idea what he actually was making, let alone how to explain it).

Than when we went to the hibachi grilling station my husband asked what the difference between the two red meats was the guy cooking the stir-fry/hibachi answered, &#34; One is steak, one is beef.&#34; REALLY?! 
(I think he was sushi guy&#39;s brother).

I&#39;ve been to several different Asian lunch buffets, the best of which was in Peoria, IL. But this place is probably the most notable one in the Schaumburg area. For $6.99 (excludes tax and tip), you can do all you can eat which includes hibachi grill, lunch buffet, and sushi bar.

The hibachi grill line is always fairly packed and they have lots of options from beef, pork, shrimp to vegetables and eggs. You load it up on your plate, take it to the grill, and they grill it for you.

The sushi bar is next to the hibachi grill and provides low class sushi ranging from California rolls to tuna rolls to a couple other ones. The rice tastes a bit hard within the sushi and it&#39;s definitely not something I&#39;d rave over (2 out of 5 stars) but it&#39;s nice that they have it to compliment everything else.

The buffet selection is off the hook. Usually, I look for two or three dishes that are decent at a place like this. They have a good selection here which I&#39;m impressed with. They have fried wings, buffalo wings, salted fries for an American taste. Their wings are absolutely delicious (which I was shocked by). Their Chinese food selection is decent ranging from deep fried string beans, chicken with broccoli, seafood medleys, vegetable medleys, stir fried noodles, vermicelli noodles, and tender beef. The best in my opinion is the deep fried string beans (but it&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve had at a Chinese buffet). Most of the food here is slightly above average, but at $6.99 for lunch, it makes it a great value. The one downside is you can strnogly taste the MSG that is plastered all over the food. The other decent item they have is the soups. The seafood tofu soup they make is closest to authentic I&#39;ve seen a place make it. Their hot and sour soup is a little bit too sour (probably just a different provincial style) and their egg drop soup is comparable to most other places.

The thing that really sets this place apart is the fruit bar. They have fresh watermelon (naturally sweet), kiwi slices, among other canned fruit. Typically, you will only see canned fruit in a place like this but I was pleasantly surprised to see fresh fruit here. It was a nice way to finish off the meal.

I would come here again with coworkers because of the nice value, but it&#39;s nothing I would be eager to eat for lunch.

SUGGESTION: Grab a $1 coupon off their website for lunch."

In this palce, the cook puts the sauces on the very limited selection of veggies and meats, so seasoning it your way is hard.  I skip it entirely now.  The sushi selection is pretty good for a cheap buffet lunch, but the soups are awful - the &#34;Hot and Sour&#34; is neither. Most of the usual entrees are well executed.  Lots of desert selections at lunch time.  A good value for $7 at lunch, but drinks are extra and you really should tip the server."

Expect to wait about 15 min on Fri-Sun.  You can&#39;t beat the $10 dinner for all you can eat Sushi and Hibachi grill.  Every time I&#39;ve visited I was very satisfied with the Sushi selection. My fav besides the sushi are the Lo Mein noodles,green beans, mini clams, salt pepper shrimp,calamari,crispy wings,beef broccoli,chicken mushroom, and the grill.

Robert M. you&#39;re a Jag-bag
&#34;The staff is all of Asian-decent. They do not speak fluent English and I am struggling to understand what they are trying to say to me at times. Sometimes they would start speaking Chinese or Japanese or God-knows-what language they are speaking to me when they can&#39;t find the English words they are trying to say. This is America! Speak English for God sake.&#34;

From what I remembered the host was a white blonde girl or Hispanic on another night.  The Hibachi chef was Hispanic, the people who brought out food was Hispanic/Asian. Wait staff all spoke English even my almost 2 yr old understood them."

Now I give it 5 stars obviously on a curve, but as far as china buffets go this one is tops for value and quality.  For $9.95/ dinner and $6.95 lunch including sushi and hibachi grill this is one heck of a deal.  Compared to most others they keep things fresh, so count on limited display of the popular dishes, but they are replenished often.  This place also gets busy so if you come a bit early you&#39;re better set to for no delay and you&#39;re fill.   

Regarding some complaints.. It&#39;s a china buffet people.. That being said there was a young white hostess and a couple asians too. The hibachi and sushi chefs appeared Hispanic and were quick and friendly.  Now I&#39;m not a huge buffet fan, but I will be back for this value again."

I&#39;ve been to most of the Asian, and more specifically, Chinese and &#34;Chinese&#34; buffets in the area and this one is the second worst. Reason:

1. Beef or rubber -- you decide
2. if a little sugar and thickener is good then more is better
3. Fifth and last visit I gave up on them and actually getting a knife (see #1)
4. They have this stuff they call sushi. Sushi is more than a technical description for stuff with rice and nori. It should be edible too. Thankfully they largely skip raw fish as the cooked doesn&#39;t leave much promise of quality.
5. Drink orders were never right and never kept filled on multiple trips. Oddly they kept asking about my water. Is fountain syrup really that costly?
6. Only very safe and typical dishes you&#39;d expect rural Iowans would pick.

The positives:
1. pot stickers
2. the very Asian canned spinach with cheese (please don&#39;t make me admit to liking this).
3.The take out by the pound prices seem reasonable
4. They do seem to be attentive to what is on the buffet except on two visits when the sushi &#34;chef&#34; must have had the day off. But really, trying to find nice things to say and having to add &#34;full steam trays&#34; as a cause for applause?
5. They seem to like mushrooms and so do I. They&#39;re in many dishes and I pick them out and leave the rest behind.

tl;dr... Panda Express is up the street. It&#39;s way better all around."

Compared to your average Chinese buffet, they have way way way more of a variety to choose from. The restaurant has plenty of seating which was nice since it was dinner time and really busy when we got there but we where seated right away. The staff is very friendly and greets you when you walk in and they are very prompt with coming around to refill your drinks and take away old plates. All of the food in the Buffet area was really fresh, which at some buffets seems like it has been there all day. I would recommend this buffet over many other Chinese buffets because they have great prices and a way bigger variety than most places. They are also very clean inside. 

The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because I got a pretty bad upset stomach afterwards, which may not necessarily be the buffets fault since I have a pretty sensitive stomach to begin with."

Generally I&#39;m buffet-averse, so i went in unsure to expect.    I&#39;ll break this review down into 3 parts: the service/ the food / The &#34;ambiance&#34;

first, i need to about the service. We were fortunate enough to get there just before the &#34;rush&#34; so we (2 people)  were seated in 10 minutes. this was better than we expected and a pleasant way to be greeted at a new restaurant.  The server came and took our drink order, and told us we coudl go up and get our food.  We did, and when we came back - there were other people seated at our table!    we went to the host&#39;s station and told them of the problem.  they acted surprised and not quite sure what to do. they were able to find us another table within a few minutes, so we sat and began to eat. This was surely a result of being open only 3 days with an inexperienced staff, so i don&#39;t think it&#39;ll happen very often in a few more weeks. I&#39;m not holding this against them. 
 
The food:  overall, it was good.  it was quite busy (see &#34;ambiance&#34; section below) so the trays were being rotated very often. i&#39;m sure if it were not as busy, the food might not have seemed as hot or fresh.   The sushi was quite good, the hibachi cook knew what he was doing.   

The ambiance:   they need to rethink their traffic &#34;flow&#34;.  the entrance got very crowded very fast.   the host stand couldn&#39;t keep up with them, so there were many angry people, unsure where to go.  There was no order or rhyme or reason to the &#34;flow&#34; of the actual buffet. I felt like people were pushing me out of the way to get to the food.  the floor was also uncommonly wet and slippery.  I&#39;m a pretty able bodied well-balanced 
person (wearing ordinary gym shoes), and i almost fell once or twice.

I&#39;ll go back, but probably not if the parking lot is full."

The food is very average (maybe a little below) for Chinese buffet standards which knocks it down to two stars.  If it wasn&#39;t for the hibachi option and sushi, probably would give it only one star.

The name sake (Hibachi Grill) is really stir fry (as a previous poster noted).  The final product from the hibachi is good, but the selection of vege&#39;s is minimal, although they did have shrimp as an item.

The sushi roll selection was reasonable and seems fresh.

Had the General&#39;s Chicken (my to go at Chinese joints) which I thought was below average compared to other General&#39;s chicken at other buffets.  The egg drop and hot sour was also very watery.  

The ice cream looked good, but didn&#39;t have the time to try it.

If your tastes buds are not picky and you want to try a variety of different items and get stuffed, you&#39;ll love the place."

First visit on a Wednesday night, and they had a good amount of customers in the restaurant.  We were seated in the front dining area (nearest to the entrance), and we had the room pretty much all to ourselves which was nice because we had a big group.

You definitely can&#39;t beat the price here. $10pp is an amazing price for the food here (they offer a Senior discount and special kids pricing too).  No snow crab legs like most people look forward to at a Chinese/Asian buffet, but they did have tons of other seafood including regular crab, crawfish and a nice variety of shrimp dishes.  The hibachi was good...nice variety of ingredients, and quickly prepared.  They had prime rib, but it was more like a pot roast and a bit dry, but overall good.  There&#39;s the usual fare you see at a buffet, and generally the taste and quality of the food here is comparable to some of our personal favorites (Crazy Buffet, Nagoya), but definitely at a better price.  They also offer individualized cups of ice cream - a huge plus since the germaphobe in me gets grossed out by the self-serve vats of ice cream offered in other restaurants (where you can never be sure the person before you washed their hands before touching that ice cream scooper...which always seems to be sitting in a cup of dirty water!). 

All around great value and food.  The place itself is okay, nothing fancy.  Big dining areas, clean-enough, and the service is great. We were greeted promptly and our server was attentive and very friendly.

Definitely adding it to our list of options for future Chinese buffet cravings."

The sushi isnt bad, esp the fried shrimp roll.  The soups are your standard, egg drop, hot sour, wonton.  The also offer a &#34;hibachi&#34; grill, which is more like the Mongolian hot griddle.  For dinner, you can get a whole small steak with it, or shrimp, pork or small slices of beef.  There will be something for everybody, including pizza, bbq ribs, prime rib chunks, fries, potatoes, roast beef, salmon, mushrooms, whatever you can name.

1st impression:  the sign out side of the restaurant is out dated . By looking at the sign it Already tell people it is another Chinese buffet!!  interior was totally Chinese style ! Overall , the restaurant is clean but the glass at hibachi so dirty !!!!!! 

The food : most of them are fresh . The most I love was the hibachi. 

Service: they are friendly . 



Overall, the price for the food it worths 4 stars."

This restaurant has far more choices to select from then your ordinary Chinese buffet. We usually try it on a Sat. for lunch because it does tend to get too crowded at dinner time. The main draw for us is the made to order items on the grill. Love the variety of noodles and the shrimp and veggies for stir fry. Quality has always been fresh.

I like many of the other items on the buffet like the grilled chicken and vegetable dishes. Not crazy about their Lo Mein noodles or the chicken and broccoli because both seemed to be made with an ingredient that I don&#39;t care for in the sauce. 

The wait staff and greeters are all very friendly are are of mixed origin. Oriental, Caucasian and Hispanic. Very strange that someone made comment that the man behind the Hibachi station was Mexican and not Oriental. I for one don&#39;t care what the race, religion or politics anyone has that cooks my food as long as it is good. Saw on TV last night where a very high end restaurant in Chicago was closing and guess what?  A man they showed doing the cooking was actually Hispanic:)

This place offers a lot of variety at a very reasonable price. They are doing a good business and hope they continue to do so."

We were directed to a table which I think if you are eating at a buffet you should be able to sit wherever you like. We were seated in a booth next to a window and we had to move because it was so cold. There was an actual breeze coming through the wall, the trim of the window was also taped with clear masking tape, perhaps to fix the cold draft? I also noticed how crammed the tables were together. If you had someone sitting behind you the actual chairs were touching one another...good luck getting up to get your food!

Overall I thought the food was great for a buffet. I haven&#39;t been to a Chinese buffet in ages so I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. They had a very large selection so you wouldn&#39;t have any problem finding something to eat. They also have a sushi station and a hibachi area. The hibachi area had a few choices of meat and shrimp, mushrooms, onions, broccoli and noodles. You didn&#39;t have a choice of any sauces but this isn&#39;t Big Bowl or Stir Crazy...if you want total customization go there. I was satisfied with the way my hibachi food turned out. They buffet area had so much food that I didn&#39;t get to try everything that I wanted to because I got super full! They also had a pretty big dessert section and ice cream station. Drinks are a separate add on to your bill and a server will get your refills for you.

At the end it was unclear how you paid. The guy who was bringing drink refills/clearing tables brought us our check and took care of it. Usually at buffets your pay when you first enter.

One thing that was a bit of a turn off was that there was a girl cleaning the decorative glass with windex. I am all about cleanliness, especially in a restaurant, but smelling the windex fumes while eating isn&#39;t ideal. Luckily I was pretty much done eating but there were other patrons who just started their meal. 

I will definitely be back though!"

I asked her if I pay for it by the pound or size and she just nodded her head and said $13, so after going back and forth I assumed I had paid $13 for the size maybe and continued to pack my to go box. As I was walking out all the workers started approaching me as if I was stealing food! I tried to explain myself but all they did was look at me and smirk like I was really trying to get away with food.

The food isn&#39;t the best quality, but if you want decent &#34;American Chinese&#34; food, then this is the place to go. They serve sushi and stir fry, along with the full buffet. For the price, I don&#39;t think you can get much better than that. 

Here&#39;s a tip, for lunch and for dinner, show up early! At least 30 minutes before the rush hits so you can at least go around the buffet and pick up the food you want."

So I was defiantly expecting something different. The first surprise that the sodas were separate. I was fine with that. For the most part the food was like any other chinese buffet except with more choices and the hibachi grill and sushi. I tried the sushi and it was fake crab. Ehh not good. They do have a wide variety though. My favourite part was the ice cream. They had 8 different flavours. I got the chocolate mint and it was very good; the best thing there.

The booths and tables are dirty and I&#39;m sure lack of cleanliness doesn&#39;t stop there. The food on the buffet was all breaded, old and lamp heated. Most of the food could not be identified unless you read the labels. The sushi was just terrible, hard undercooked rice over old flavorless frozen fish. The service, well a lady sat us down and that was about all the service we received. The booths are so large in fact I had to sit at the edge just to come up to the table, I&#39;m sure because of the scale of persons that frequent this place.

I dined here this evening. Food was pretty good for an Asian buffet. Some items exceeded my expectations, some didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t try the &#34;hibachi&#34; but my mother in law did, she liked it but it looked just ok. Sushi was fresh and better than I&#39;ve had at other buffets. 
My big issue came when one of the hostesses came over and said &#34;Can I take the check for you or....&#34; I knew exactly what she was implying but said &#34;Oh no thanks, we will take care of it.&#34; In which she replied &#34;Ok, its just that there is a really long line and a lot of people waiting.&#34; I was so flabbergasted by her rudeness that I didn&#39;t even know what to say!

When I received a large well designed ad several days ago announcing that it was now open for business I suggested to my wife that we should try it. 

We arrived to a full parking lot but luckily we found a spot to park. Walking up to the front entrance was a disappointment as there was an accumulation of trash along the sidewalk and some monster weeds in the landscape beds by the front door. You would think that the management would want the entrance to be inviting not disgusting. As we proceeded into the building we could not help but notice that there was a noticeable amount of trash on the floor inside as well. We checked in with the hostess and waited only about five minutes before we were escorted to a table which had apparently just been wiped down and left wet. We hadn&#39;t even sat down yet and I mentioned to the waitress that the table was very wet hoping that she might offer to dry it off. That wasn&#39;t going to happen apparently so I grabbed some napkins and started to dry the surface myself to find that the napkins were picking up more than just clear water. My wife pointed out that her chair seat was also very wet and the floor below our table had used napkins and food scraps on it.  We looked at each other and mutually decided that this was not a good beginning and we decided to leave. 

I know that the restaurant was extremely busy and that the employees and management probably need more experience to hopefully work out the problems but our first impression was not good. We might try again in the near future if we see some good reviews on Yelp that may indicate improvement."

Their service stinks, however. I placed an order on their website for several items, and requested to use a coupon for a free dessert on orders over $20 which was an offer on their printed menu. The coupon had no expiration or stipulations other than the $ minimum. However, after placing my order, I get a voicemail from a random company I wasn&#39;t expecting telling me that my order will be processed and my credit card charged but Pietanzas refused the coupon. I call Pietanzas to ask why, and am told they don&#39;t want to honor their coupon because they use this shell service to process online orders and the fees are too high. I say, not my fault. Nothing on their website or coupon says no coupons or I would have just called in. I ask to cancel my order, and am told that they&#39;ll cancel my food order but my cc will still be charged until I go through this other company. I don&#39;t want to go through hoops and ladders to get a refund from a shell service hiding in their mobile app that I didn&#39;t realize I was using. Of course, I do, and have to wait 24-48 hrs for a refund, and double check that it posts.  The whole reason I was happy to order online (prior to this experience) is because they have repeatedly (and I do mean repeatedly) forgotten or gotten elements of our orders wrong in the past. I never called to complain in the past, because it wasn&#39;t worth the hassle, but I finally had it today. Why offer a service you don&#39;t want your customers to use (because of fees) and penalize your customers. The easiest thing would have been for the guy to say sorry, I&#39;ll give you the free piece of cake, next time please call to use coupon.  How much does it cost to get a new repeat customer? Now, the manager can check our order history and ask himself if losing a customer was worth the $1-2 profit on that piece of cake.

****Edit**** added an image which clearly does not indicate when starting an order that you are using some other service. On additional pages, branding is subtle enough to be overlooked, which is what they intended. Telling me it&#39;s my fault for not realizing I was inadvertently signing up for a shell service IS NOT good management/service skills. Also, as I mentioned, your coupon had no expiration and was printed on your menu. Additionally, the other company said they called you to verify the coupon use, and that you specifically chose to not honor it. So don&#39;t try and say the other company was at fault. This is on you. You even told me on the phone that you would have honored had we called in our order, but not online because you don&#39;t like paying the third party fees!!  Guess what, if you don&#39;t like the fees, don&#39;t use the service.  Next, people order food when they are tired and not feeling up to cooking, so the idea of calling and fighting over some missing arrancinni or cake when all you want to do is sit down and eat is a big reason why MANY people don&#39;t bother calling in on a mistake. 

At the end of the day, the manager shouldn&#39;t be in management. There are many solutions to any given problem, and the goal is to choose the best solution that most achieves your aim. If his goal was to deescalate the situation and turn a negative situation into an opportunity to shine, he chose the worst (which was to do nothing, and continue doing nothing), and blame customer for the restaurants deceptive practice, no matter how unintentional.

In the end, he chose the best solution....to losing a customer."

First, it&#39;s very close to my home which makes it more convenient. 

They always provide great customer service and they are friendly and they make sure that you get your food on time. 

They have a very extensive menu which is a good thing because you may want to change it up a bit and the options are very authentic which makes it even better. 

The prices are decent, not as expensive as other pizza parlors. 

Last but not least their pizza is phenomenal! I really enjoy their thin crust. The pizza is very cheesy and the sauce is sweet and delicious. 

I think I&#39;ll be ordering my pizzas every Saturday from now on."

We have had everything from the soups (my wife loves them) and salads (tried 3 different ones, and they all have their merits) to pizzas to pasta.  All the food has been delicious and fresh.  We have not eaten in the restaurant, but have done carry out.  All the food (unless it is a salad. :-) ) comes out piping hot.   All of the people that work there are very nice and seem happy to work there.  Great little spot for pizza!  

They also have gluten free cheese pizza which made my sister very happy."

Let me start by saying that all their dishes are homemade. I had the Shrimp Diavolo, and my girlfriend got the lasagna. 

The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was very flavorful. You can see the fresh diced garlic, and small diced onions in the sauce. The shrimp was tail on, and you pick it up and eat it. It was good. The sauce could have been a little more spicy, but I can&#39;t foul them for that, because I love real spicy food. 

The lasagna was a nice large portion. It had plenty of cheese, and plenty of flavor! The sauce was delicious, and it was cooked perfect!

Also, both times we&#39;ve ordered from here, the food showed up piping hot! I love that. 

If you&#39;re looking for some good pasta dishes in the area, look no further. This place is super legit."

Ordered a large half sausage half pepperoni, the Mediterranean bread (their version of garlic bread), and a chefs salad. Picked up my order and the staff is very friendly. I dig great customer service because it makes me want to keep patronizing the place. 
   
   Got home and the boys tore into the pizza. No complaints. The salad was fresh and homemade. Not like just lettuce and a few vegetables. But a seriously great put together salad. Huge slivers of carrots, fresh mushrooms, green pepper, red onions, olives, Italian meats and cheeses.  Nothing about this salad screamed premade. The dressing was great. Almost like a vinegar and oil with a sweetness to it. Fantastic. 

   Mediterranean bread had big chunks of garlic and seasoning. It was sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. This wasn&#39;t a hotdog bun with some garlic butter smeared on it. There was some thought put into this bread. 

   We ordered a standard regular crust pizza. Sausage and pepperoni were good. Crust was nice and crunchy. The sauce was great and again had a little sweetness to it. It&#39;s nothing like any pizzeria in the Chicagoland area. I grew up in Addison where we had hundreds of pizzerias and I never had this kind of sauce. Pizza was cooked perfectly. 

I talked with the gentleman at the counter (owner?) and told him this was my first order. He seemed genuinely nice and stated he hoped we enjoyed the order. He mentioned they moving and opening a pizzeria on Army Trail Rd and 59 for take out and sit down after the new year. The only bummer is we&#39;re going to have to drive a little farther for this food but it&#39;s going to be worth it. Thank you Pietanzas for not just being a normal run of the mill pizzeria but a restaurant that puts pride into their food."

Our recent order I instantly became volatilely sick on.
 I may have receive food where either the meat quality was expired or the burned dessert I received may have been left over too long before I got it. I was so hungry I tried to eat around the dessert, my food this time was not fresh as usual. I understand that this can occur with many restaurants and I am only commenting to this because I was greatly disappointed.

Plus, it&#39;s so much closer to my home than I realized that I can&#39;t believe it took us so long to get out and try their food. 

Their menu is a bit much for a carry out joint. At least that&#39;s what I thought when I originally checked it out online. We ordered a pasta combo with ravioli, manicotti and a meatball with the side soup, the salmon vesuvio with the side salad, arancini and the Mediterranean garlic bread. With our $20+ order, we received a small cheese pizza. I now feel pretty strongly that I am grateful for the options especially since the vast majority of our first order was delicious!

Lemme get the &#39;misses&#39; out of the way.  We did not love our free cheese pizza.  I know it&#39;s rediculous to complain about something that was free, but it wasn&#39;t very good. I am guessing that their free pizza might mislead people into thinking that their regularly ordered pizza isn&#39;t any good. Why?  The pizza had clearly been made sometime earlier, it was pulled from a hot box and it was rubbery when we ate it. Now, the crust had a nice taste and the sauce was flavorful, but because I think it had been sitting for a while, I didn&#39;t get that fresh pizza affect.  (It is highly likely that we will order a pizza next time to prove to ourselves that they make a great pizza...)  And the Mediterranean garlic bread was not something I would order again. It was very dry, so it soaked up the marinara sauce well, but it ended up being unnecessary. 

The perks?  Everything else!  The prices were right in line with what I would expect. The salmon vesuvio was cooked beautifully and still piping hot when I got it home. The pasta combo was devoured by my hubby. The meatball was clearly homemade and bursting with real Italian lovin&#39;!  There was complimentary focaccia included which made me swoon!  The salad was fresh, crisp and the perfect size. The arancini...ricey, cheesy, meaty goodness and complimented just right with a kicking marinara sauce.  The front counter guy was quirky and kind. The waiting area had a few chairs. They also had a full case of soda options. 

Side note.  I was waiting for my food when a gentleman walked in. We waited in silence until five minutes later when another gentleman walked in. They clearly knew each other and started speaking in Italian. The nice thing about the Italian language is that it is accompanied by hand gestures. Here&#39;s what I gathered:

1: Hey man!  How&#39;ve you been?  
2: Hey!  I&#39;m so good now that I&#39;ve bumped into you!
1: You&#39;re the greatest!  How&#39;s the family?
2: They&#39;re doing well. Well, at least they will be once I get home with dinner. They wanted Italian food and I went to Caputo&#39;s, but couldn&#39;t find anything that looked good, so here I am. 
1: Ha ha ha!  My son loves the sausage and bacon pizza here at Pietanza&#39;s, so I&#39;m here every other day!

They went on to talk about the old neighborhood and that kid Johnny and such, but the moral of this story is that I must go back and try their pizza."

Arancini were bigger than golf balls. The Patete/Potatoes smelled like Christmas with rosemary. Calamari was not rubbery at all, had rings &amp; bodies. Each Risotto entree must have been 1lb/piece. Only surprise was Chicken Parmigiana not being breaded."

All I hear at work is Pizza this and pizza that. And being a 3rd shifter, it is very hard to get pizza at 2 in the morning. 

Well, finally, I had a day off and of course, what I want is pizza. So.... I did a review of pizza places around me and sorted them by highest review. And what would you know.... Pietanza is right at the top. In fact, is the top and only one in the top. &#34;Hey....&#34; i pondered for a minute. &#34;I think I will get pizza from here&#34;, as I replied by not so obvious question. 

I ordered the pizza with a friendly man on the phone. He asked if it was delivery or pickup and then what I wanted and he said my name. &#34;Whoa...&#34; I thought. Either he is psychic and knew I was calling OR he has caller ID. I just figured it was the first because fate wanted me to eat pizza and fate bought me here. 

After about 17 minutes, I left to pick up my pizza. He said arrive in 25 minutes and Google said the place was 7 minutes away. Give an extra minute for the busy red light and off I was to get my pizza. I arrived and picked up my deliciously smelling pizza. Drove home as fast as I could going the speed limit. Well, actually, I was driving under the speed limit. Today must be &#34;Drive 5-10 under the speed limit day&#34; or something. I will have to google this because that occured to me while driving there and while driving back. 

BUT...back to the review. The pizza was delicious and I will be back. End of story. Thank-you. Yummy!!!"

Pietanza&#39;s is AMAZING.  Their menu is really extensive--with some restaurants, it means that they do a lot of dishes in a mediocre fashion (::coughCHEESECAKEFACTORYcough::) but for Pietanza&#39;s, this means that they have a lot of amazing dishes to choose from!

My husband and I were &#34;hungry ordering&#34;, which can be pretty dangerous!  In this case, it meant order $41 worth of food for the two of us (whoops!!).  But at least we had delicious leftovers!!

OK, here&#39;s what we got:
**Mini Panzerotti
**Homemade Mini Arancini (4)
**Risotto Al Funghi &amp; Pollo (Italian rice w/sauteed w/portobello mushrooms and chicken)--Comes w/ soup or salad
**Cavatelli Alfredo (Homemade fresh pasta tossed in alfredo sauce with mushrooms, spinach &amp; broccoli)--Comes w/ Soup or salad
**Pepper and Egg Sandwich

Sooooo, now after I see all of that typed out, I can see why they gave us enough condiments/utensils for a family of five.  Meh, oh well!

OK, so everything was REALLY good (the first AND the second day) for everything except for the Pepper and Egg Sandwich--my husband thought that was a bit too greasy and didn&#39;t even finish it all :(

But the pasta tasted homemade for sure, right down to the sauce and especially the noodles.  The Mini Panzerottis were really good and well-seasoned!  the Arancini is in a class all by itself.  These were SO good inside and out.

Honestly, though, my favorite was the Risotto with the Arancini coming in close second.  My risotto was made of happy tears and unicorn glitter, FOR SHIZ.  I cannot believe how good this was.  They had some other different kinds for me to try, but the mushroom/chicken one that I ordered is what dreams are made of!

This chef really knows what they&#39;re doing, and they have the right customer service to match!!  I will definitely be back again, and SOON!


The only thing that keeps them from being a five-star review is that they forgot our free pizza for ordering over $20 worth of food.  But it was free, so I didn&#39;t call and say anything.  But my husband was disappointed because that was going to be part of his meal :("

Well let me tell you I wished I lived a little closer to my friend. 
We had delivery-the person who delivered the pizza firstly was the nicest delivery person...very friendly a lot of thanks and have a nice day....

We had a half and half pizza one side veggies for me and meat for my friend all the ingredients were fresh and delicious and the crust was very crispy without being burnt.  Then I tried the Panzerotti it is a wonderful pocket of deliciousness with tomato sauce and delicious cheese inside a little puff... (I would highly reccomend trying this its a great little apitizer to split)....there is something about the freshness of the ingredients that makes the food at this pizza place wonderful.

We ordered a large Pizza Margarita to go. Their thin crust pizza is good - something I&#39;d order again, and particularly because the vegetables used were bright and fresh. 

You can&#39;t really hide behind anything in a Margarita; it&#39;s basil, tomatoes, garlic and mozzarella, with some cheese. So I thought it wasn&#39;t the best thin crust pizza I&#39;ve ever had, but definitely worth going back for.

Ah, but the arancini. This was excellent. For whatever reason a description isn&#39;t provided on the website, so I&#39;ll describe it as: medium-sized balls of cheese, rice and peas, battered and then deep fried. It&#39;s served with a fresh tomato salsa.

The arancini was perfect. Crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, still hot when I got home. I think Chef Vincenzo knows what he&#39;s doing.

Can&#39;t wait to go back and try other appetizers! They seem to have a surprisingly strong seafood side of the menu, so perhaps the Insalade di Mare will be next?"

One time when we ordered my husband was disappointed so weeks later when we ordered again he actually told them: &#34;last time it wasn&#39;t like normal so make sure you make it like normal this time.&#34; In his opinion they totally came thru ;-)

We&#39;ve also ordered other items like pasta and sandwiches and even a couple desserts and everything has been great. And it always comes super fast when it&#39;s delivered.

Extra bonus: the delivery man sometimes brings a dog treat for our dog too! :-)"

All words I would use to describe this place. Hands down best pizza place in town. If you havent tried it you have no idea what you are missing. The owner says everything is homemade, and you sure can tell the difference.  This place stands out above the rest. I have only had one problem with them. My mozzarella sticks were forgotten for my lunch delivery yesterday, and when I called back to inform them they offered either a credit or to bring them. I asked for them to be delivered,  they showed up before my break was even over and to top it off he gave me like 20 sticks and a apology written on the box! You dont get service like this anywhere else. While on the topic of service,  I asked for two pizza slices on a large delivery (about $70.00) at lunch and when the driver showed up he said they didnt know if they would sell out of slices so chef made me a whole pizza!!!  highly recommend this place. You cant go wrong with anything on the menu. Its so good me and my coworkers order at least 3 times a week for lunch.

Try the spinach salad.  Its amazing!!!!
 Keep up the good work guys!!!!"

First, I&#39;ve only ordered for delivery and have not been inside the restaurant.  They have a stellar chunky chicken salad panini with blue cheese that is so yummy and craveable that I&#39;ve had it twice.  However, anything else I&#39;ve had off the menu has been only so-so.  We had a large order this week and it was terrible.  The food arrived cold, none of the food cartons were sealed so some spilled, the sandwiches were overly salty and our single &#34;special request&#34; (unsalted fries) was ignored.

When you walk in there&#39;s a rotating pizza pan heated with slices for sale along with paper copies of the menu&#39;s. In visiting Pietanza&#39;s Pizzeria I decided to try Lasagna, I also purchased several slices of pizza for myself and co-workers to try. 

The first item to go over is the Lasagna, the Lasagna is made with fresh noodles, flavorful cheese and lots of beef and sausage. The tomato sauce used is a little on the thin side but provides a nice flavor. For the price (around 11.00 + tax) this was definitely a lot of food and came with soup and bread. The lasagna tasted even better than it looked and overall I was very impressed by the texture, flavor and price of the meal. I&#39;d recommend it.

I also had the opportunity to try a little of their pizza. This was one of the individual slices and was a medium thickness crust. The crust was tasty, the sauce was sweet and but not too excessively applied and the quality of the cheese was excellent. This was bolstered  by the fact that there is a 1.00 pizza slice special on Mondays, which happens to be the day that I visited. While this wasn&#39;t the best pizza in the world, for the price I can&#39;t complain.

Overall I liked Pietanza&#39;s Pizzeria and will definitely return again. I thought my pasta dish (the Lasagna) was a bit better than their pizza and would recommend it to anyone with a craving for Garfield&#39;s favorite dish."

Portobello Mushroom (divine), Caesar Steak (equally excellent) and the Chicken Parmigiana (very good - but could have been better if the bread was grilled crispy like the others)   Since we checked in with Yelp when we ordered, we scored a free Panzerotti - in addition to the cheese and tomato that is part of the standard offering, we added Italian Beef and Hot Giardiniera -- OMG it was over-the-top yummy!  We each also added a side to our sandwiches for only $1.19 ea... (decent portions / great value) awesome deep fried mushrooms, very good fried zucchini and good roasted potatoes.

Christy&#39;s serves breakfast all day long, and with the high Yelp ratings, I couldn&#39;t pass it up. 

Super cute old fashioned diner. I really liked the homey and warm, welcoming feel. 

The menu is quite big and I ended up tasting a few different items. First off - the omelettes are huge! I tasted a bacon and cheese omelette and it was delish. The eggs were really fluffy and the bacon had a great taste. It tasted like a good omelette that you would make at home. They are generous with hash browns and even though I didn&#39;t try them, my company said that they were some of the best hash browns they&#39;ve had. I was also told the spinach and feta omelette was really good. It sure looked yummy!

I had the breast of chicken salad, and although when it was brought to the table, I didn&#39;t think it was going to be that good.. And I was wrong. It was an excellent salad. No bagged lettuce.. It was very fresh, crisp romaine. The chicken breast was juicy and had great flavor. The salad wasn&#39;t too big but it was very filling. 

I tasted both regular and the multigrain pancakes and they were the stars of the meal for sure. I especially loved the multigrain pancakes.. Both have such different tastes, but I love the hint of cinnamon in the multigrain ones. The regular pancakes taste really cakey.. They almost reminded me of funfetti cake.

Overall, great meal and really great service. The coffee was very enjoyable too!

We went based on the Yelp reviews not having spent much time in the vicinity.

Well deserved because the food and service rock!

The atmosphere is fun, kind of old timey.. clean, lively... popular.

As far as the service goes, our waitress was on top of things. Anytime we asked for something not quite as advertised she always responded with &#34;sure, we can do that&#34; or something like it. Other people kept checking on us throughout the meal.. we were wanting for nothing.

We were there with our foodie friends; Adam and Janet and our son Ian. The menu had so many good choices that we couldn&#39;t make up our minds. 

Janet was all about french toast, which she really enjoyed. Adam was talking about a couple of different things, so I mentioned that I was thinking about the corned beef hash omelette.. he said &#34;that&#39;s what I&#39;m having&#34;... I gave him the evil eye.. but to no avail. I wasn&#39;t going to order the same thing.. we like to &#34;experience&#34; a place.

With pressure mounting (we were really hungry!) I made the decision to go with the country omelette, (that&#39;s ham, bacon and onions topped with sausage gravy) I asked if we could go light on the onions.... &#34;sure, we can do that&#34; and with well done hash browns (crispy!) and pancakes. One word &#34;Delicious&#34;.. oh, ok.. next word &#34;Filling&#34;

Ian ordered the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito, loved it! And my lovely bride had a broccoli omelette with the seasonal pumpkin pancakes.

So, that idea thief Adam really enjoyed his Corned Beef Hash Omelette.. fortunately for him I was a happy camper .. actually, all five of us were.

Probably should go do some more &#34;k&#39;s&#34; except a nap sounds better. Wonder what we should have for dinner..."

The service was great.  Our waitress was perfect.  Before my husband ordered, he asked her if the chili was hot.  She said no it was not.  He ordered it.  A few minutes later, after delivering our table a warm bread basket, she brought him out a small sampling of the chili so that he could be sure it was to his liking.  That was so nice.  The chili had the perfect amount of heat for him.  I had the salad that had the chicken fingers on it with tomatoes, corn, cucumber, red onion and walnuts.  I opted for creamy garlic dressing rather than the recommended ranch dressing. I loved the salad.  It was huge. The chicken fingers were very good.  I can&#39;t think of one thing that I was not completely satisfied with.  I&#39;m glad we tried this restaurant."

Anything other than breakfast has mostly been a letdown for me. The breakfast items have been good, but I think Bentley&#39;s down the street is much better. I like to branch out and try different things, but there&#39;s been so much hit or miss here that I&#39;ll likely stick to a few staples.

We&#39;re fans of the Chicken Noodle Soup, but the Clam Chowder is goopy without much flavor. Their Fish Fry was decent diner quality, but the Steak Quesadilla was incredibly bland. I will go to town on a Quesadilla any day of the week, but I found myself with 75% of it uneaten on Mexican Night and didn&#39;t fight my Husband for the leftovers (and if you know us, you&#39;d know that my Husband eating my leftovers is the strongest point of contention in our relationship).

My Husband and his Cousin spoke highly of Christy&#39;s after coming for breakfast the first time, and I remember liking them when I came for breakfast years ago, but they both agreed that the other entrees aren&#39;t that great. They encouraged me to stop ordering lunch and dinner items and to go with the breakfast foods. I finally listened and those dishes have been the most enjoyable meals so far. I really like the Hungryman&#39;s Skillet (nix &#39;shrooms, add tomatoes). I&#39;m also fond of their multigrain toast and what appears to be housemade blackberry jam.

I have to say that I was both disappointed and impressed with our most recent visit because I ordered a slice of pie that I found to be inedible, but our server noticed I was displeased with it and offered to swap it without hesitation.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE Key Lime Pie. Much like Quesadillas, I will find any excuse to eat a slice of Key Lime Pie even if it&#39;s not the best or most authentic. However, I could not eat what they call Key Lime Pie here. First of all, it&#39;s bright green, so you know the pie maker is either using lime flavoring and/or is adding coloring to it (it should be a muted yellow). Secondly, almost every Key Lime Pie I&#39;ve come across has a consistency somewhere between thick custard and cheesecake. That was not at all the case with this dessert. It seemed like it was trying to be Lime Meringue and failing miserably. It had a bottom layer somewhat like a creamy packaged pudding and a top layer that was much like thick Cool Whip. Perhaps you can recall your Grandmother&#39;s Jell-O fruit salads with the multicolored marshmallows on top. It was a lot like that. If this pie were a song, it would be this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tWuG2oPL3o. Truly, I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s anything inherently bad with &#34;salads&#34; from the 50&#39;s or even that pie as its own entity, but to call it a Key Lime Pie is misleading and I couldn&#39;t do it. I swapped it for a slice of Chocolate Fudge Cake and that, though incredibly sweeter than it needed to be, was much more my speed.

Overall, aside from the breakfast, I give the food 2 stars. It&#39;s not horrible, but it doesn&#39;t always hit the mark or the spot. The extra star is to make up for what they do well and I&#39;d give the service 5 stars any day of the week! All the employees have been incredibly nice and on top of things. They seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and interacting with customers.

TL;DR - Stick to breakfast and tip their hardworking servers well!"

And I hardly visit any because I mostly dine in Downtown Chicago BUT I love supporting family owned restaurants and it was the highest rated review near Itasca, IL so my husband and I (who don&#39;t celebrate Easter) came in around 8:15 on Easter morning and were greeted immediately. It is a very bright and colorful restaurant and our waitress was great. She was very friendly, got us coffees immediately, gave us a little time on our menus and when my order didn&#39;t come with a certain topping she took it back immediately. 

She brought the plate back saying they just added the topping to to my omelette and asked me if that was okay? It was because I just didn&#39;t care too much. We got refills on our coffees and our check quickly too. It&#39;s a typical breakfast restaurant with nothing too much and the ingredients are okay but if I am hungry for breakfast again- I could see myself coming back!"

I got here shortly before they were closing, so that may have an effect on my review, but they were by no means busy.

The place has a very traditional diner look and vibe.  I&#39;ll definitely agree with a previous reviewer that seating is very tight.

The server came up with a water and asked if I knew what I wanted to eat before I&#39;d even opened a menu.  I quickly decided and had my food pretty quickly.

I ordered the sausage biscuit skillet.  The portion was huge!  The food was just average though, no where near what I&#39;d expected after browsing the previous reviews.  

While I was eating, they came buy and were sweeping and mopping right around me.  This is a pet peeve of mine, I understand I got there close to closing time, but don&#39;t stir up the days funk while I&#39;m trying to eat.  I cashed out about 10 minutes after they&#39;d technically closed.  I feel like the guy could&#39;ve waited a few.

I&#39;d give this place another shot though.  It&#39;s a quick, cheap food option that easily beats out any of the fast food joints."

My husband got a skillet and said it was delicious and his sunny side up eggs were cooked perfectly. I had the corned beef hash with over easy eggs and French toast. It was some of the best hash I&#39;ve had in a long time. If I lived closer to Christy&#39;s I would be a regular. The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge.

There were a lot of people here even at 10am on a Monday; however, it was Labor Day so that could be it too.  It wasn&#39;t a large restaurant but that was fine.

I had looked at the menu beforehand on their website so I knew what to expect.  I decided on the pancakes which came with sausage links for $5.50.  We also ordered orange juice, but I forgot how much that was.  The food took awhile to come out but they were pretty busy.  The pancakes were delicious and very fluffy which I liked in pancakes.  There were four pancakes and I was full when I finished it all.  The sausage links were good as well.  Our waiter checked on us a few times but was busy running around helping other tables.

Been going here for years, and never really had a bad experience.  The Servers are always great and friendly. I&#39;ve never once had a table that was sticky, or spots on my glasses or silverware like you&#39;ll find at lots of other places.  Little things like that go a long way with me. 

Their breakfast, their wraps, patty melts and Friday all you can eat Fish fry are some of my favorites.

We ordered and our waitress was not very friendly or nice but she looked pregnant so I thought maybe she just didn&#39;t feel well. About 10-15 later she returned and told me they didn&#39;t have feta for my omelet so did I want a different cheese. I thought a different cheese would be gross and had my heart set on feta. So I selected another omelet instead. The food was not good. Our hash brown were cold, the veggies in my omelet were either raw or water logged... I had to ask for the side of bacon we ordered when someone walked by because the waitress didn&#39;t come back.

Breakfast: you cannot go wrong with their pancakes, skillets, or breakfast wraps. I absolutely love their Greek wraps and skillets. You can play it safe with a Denver omelette or pancake platter. I can&#39;t help but to ask for whatever the special is and then be surprised. I prefer stronger coffee, so I do have to ask them to make the coffee stronger for me, which they always do.

Lunch: very good burgers but by far my favorite are their home made soups. They have this great chicken dumpling soup that is just out of this world good. 

Please try Christie&#39;s at least once. For breakfast my wife and I usually spend $23-$30 including tip."

My craving steak and eggs were undeniable.

Christy&#39;s is a spacious, clean, well lit diner with a retro early 50s counter that almost had me thinking twice before sitting at the booth. We were greeted and seated immediately. The menu is vast with many options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Our server was what we believe a newbie. He didn&#39;t know if the steak and eggs came with potatoes (had to go ask), brought out butter to our table before we even ordered (in the end we didn&#39;t need the butter, our toast came buttered), and awkwardly checks up on us, which is not big deal, I&#39;ve worked in restaurants before it&#39;s hard being the new person/training.

Scott opted for the chorizo omelette while I went with the skirt steak (medium rare, always!) and double yolk eggs and hasbrowns (www.yelp.com/biz_photos/christys-pancake-house-wood-dale?select=MAfpZVDpcm3SSy58iQoHFg#YQtNfeOumemXzPEtcR6XKw). The chorizo omelette was overwhelmed chorizo that didn&#39;t allow us to taste anything else, not even the eggs, most likely won&#39;t be ordering that again, but the steak and eggs? Egg-tastic! Steak-rific! The steak was cooked to perfection and tender. First time having double yolk eggs and I enjoyed them, how can I not? I love yolk. I even shared some of my steak with Scott and he enjoyed it too, actually I&#39;m sure he was a bit jealous because his chorizo omelette wasn&#39;t satisfying.  

We were asked by other servers, possibly the owner/host how everything was and our server did his best. Because of those awesome steak and eggs I&#39;ll definitely be back to try the rest of their menu."

Every time when I&#39;m sitting in traffic waiting for the train gates to come up, I kept telling myself one of these days I&#39;ll have to check that place out I always see it busy.
So I finally came to Christy&#39;s Pancake House which is near the train station off of Irving park rd.  It was a Saturday mid morning and we were hungry for some local grub.  
When we walked in, the place was packed and the space looked a bit snug.  The decor had an old fashion homey feel, like you were at grandma&#39;s house.
We had to wait which we expected on a Saturday morning, but not too long as we were able to get seated in a semi booth.
As soon as we were seated, they took our drink order, coffee, juice, and water.  The menu is huge and we were greeted with a friendly waitress, Karen.  We enjoyed having her serve us as this was our first time here.  She was funny and a delight to be around even with the hectic crowd.  I like that they fill our drinks even without us asking.
Hubby and I ordered breakfast.  I got the Spinach and feta omelet with pancakes.  The omelet was huge, nice a fluffy eggs and the Spinach and feta tasted fresh.  It came with hash browns, which was ok I asked for a crispier crust.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy.  
Hubby got their chorizo skillet with multigrain toast.  It was also pretty good and a lot of it.  The chorizo was spicy with green peppers, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos and cheddar cheese.  All topped off with fluffy scrambled eggs.
We also order a side of corned beef hash crispy please.  Man when you see our table it looks like we ordered for 4 people even though it was just us the two of us, lol! 
All our food came out in a timely manner and piping hot.  There was plenty to take home, next time we&#39;ll need to share a meal...naw LOL!

It was just awful...wow, awful! My husband had eggs, potatoes and a chicken breast...the eggs were done well, the potatoes mediocre and the breast was dry as if warmed in a microwave...terrible. I ordered the special of the day--stuffed cabbage. It came with mashed potatoes, a white and a red sauce and gravy for the potatoes. Also a chicken noodle soup. It was all terrible. The soup was a canned broth with a flavor enhancement likened to ramen noodle with cheap store bought noodles and no chicken whatsoever. The cabbage was tasteless, old, like last week&#39;s shoe leather warmed up. The white sauce tasted nothing more than flour and water, the red sauce was okay. The mashed potatoes were a cheap boxed mix with canned brown gravy enhanced with flour. The coffee was old and bitter and even the crackers individually wrapped were stale and hard. The waitress was lacking grace. She shoved the plate of chicken into my husbands face while she paid attention to the men behind him. He caught the plate before it hit his face or dropped into his lap. The manager came to the table and although his words said sorry, his voice and demeanor were uninterested and rude. He took the meal off my bill but made me pay for the horrible soup.  I went out to eat because I did not want to cook and frankly I would have been better off cooking at home because I know my meal wouldn&#39;t have been old, stale and out of a cheap box. I do NOT ever recommend this place. It used to be really a good breakfast but now its just junkie and WAY overpriced for boxed, old, stale food."

We were all starving (not from walking, but from having been awake for so long to get to the stupid 5k).

As soon as we sat down coffee was poured, and it was refilled constantly during out meal.

The food was delicious and plentiful.  The menu was way too large for me, so I had a hard time choosing.  Eventually I just decided to pick on of the healthy options, since it was at the top of the front page.

I had egg whites, turkey sausage, canned peaches and toast.  Everything was great, except the peaches.  I asked if they were fresh and was told they were, so I was very disappointed to receive canned/jarred peaches. I wish I had asked for fruit in place of the peaches but that is a minor complaint.

I tried the Mexican omelet, hash browns, and crepes off of friends.  Everything was great.

I stop in for a gyro about once every other week. The waffle fries are delicious. Their cream-based soups are fab. Service is good. Ambience is good. Coffee is good. Location, next to the Metra, is convenient. There&#39;s plenty of parking.

The only down side is Irving Park Rd. traffic where the train tracks cross... I don&#39;t think the city planned that intersection too well. That&#39;s got nothing to do with Christy&#39;s though. When you get sick of waiting for the train (or waiting for it to pass!!!), stop in for some soup!"

I ordered the chicken gyros platter.  It came with soup and salad.  The chili lentil &#34;soup&#34; was very good and the Greek salad was quite large for a &#34;side&#34; salad although they went a little overboard with the oil &amp; vinegar dressing.  Unfortunately, the chicken gyros seemed like prefabricated meat from a package and not carved from a spit.  All slices were of uniform size and thickness.  The gyros didn&#39;t have much flavor.
My wife ordered the veggie stir fry and added shrimp.  She enjoyed it and there were a good number of shrimp that looked quite succulent.
Service was topnotch as usual.  The server quickly topped off our sodas even before we asked.  The price was reasonable for the two of us for dinner; $33.
You get a lot of food for the money.

Christy&#39;s still one of our favorite breakfast places."

Had lunch and the place was very busy. I was alone but seated at a booth instead of being offered to sit at the counter. Again nice touch and friendly. 

My waitress (Karen) was very busy but made me feel I was her only table. She took time to answer my questions and always kept my water glass full.  I watched her with the other tables and she treated every one the same. 

I had a Reuben sandwich that was much better than average. Not greasy, home made corned beef, with the 1000 Island dressing served on the side. 

Bottom line - good food with great, friendly service and reasonable prices. I&#39;ll be back."

I&#39;m looking around and see, in the small refrigerated case behind the counter, an unidentifiable fruit. There are oranges, apples, half a cantaloupe, some watermelon, and a shiny reddish ... something that looks rather like a small pumpkin.

&#34;What IS that?&#34; I stared at it for awhile, puzzling over what this peculiar-looking vegetation might be, and finally my husband gets out of his seat to look too, not believing that I can&#39;t identify it. But he, too, is mystified.

When our waiter returned to check in on us and offer the 13th refill on water for my always-thirsty husband, we just had to ask. 

&#34;Oh, that&#39;s just for decoration. I wondered that myself but it turns out it&#39;s papier-mache.&#34;

Aww, man, and here I thought I was discovering some new and exotic fruit!

Fake imaginary vegetation, table tents advertising &#34;spicey&#34; cheese on your hashbrowns, wonderful Greek salads, gyros, burgers, chicken, sandwiches, all the tasty breakfast you can imagine all day long, plus friendly and  ... Christy&#39;s is a gem and I&#39;m thrilled to have it down the street from us."

With a huge selection of delicious plates for breakfast and lunch, you&#39;ll never leave with anything but a full stomach and a small bill.

Breakfast is a touchy, fine detailed ordeal. Everything has to be spot on. And at Christy&#39;s, it is right there at getting the full 5 stars from me.

The food is spectacular, with a huge array of skillets, pancakes, even 1 lb. burgers that are amazing. The prices are also very cheap. I get a Hungry Man&#39;s Skillet for $9 which includes: eggs, hash browns, mushrooms, diced ham, sausage, bacon, and even a side of two pancakes. 

The decor is a traditional breakfast restaurant look. Unique little adornments make it stand out from some of the cheaper breakfast spots around the area, but it is also a step down from some of the classier locations.

The only reason this place lost a star was my cousin&#39;s sausage was a bit dry, and the silverware we got was pretty dirty. Seems like a small thing, but nothing throws off your appetite like crusted on food on your silverware.

Bottom Line: If you&#39;re looking for an awesome breakfast, go check out Christy&#39;s."

It&#39;s a neighborhood joint full of people who have probably been bringing their families there for years. I was overwhelmed at first glance with the advertisements all over the windows, tables, and by their menu which is the size of a novel. You want pancakes? How many, with bacon? Sausage? How about hash browns or grits? But wait! Just plain pancakes, why not try blueberry, or bacon? I&#39;m all for variety but when it&#39;s that much it becomes overkill. I tried the pancakes which were giant and nice and fluffy. I also got scrambled egg whites and grits. They serve their grits instant from the box and plain with no butter or anything, so fair warning. It was plenty of food, neither my husband or I could finish out plates. It&#39;s nice that it is right off the Wood Dale metra station. Not bad at all, not wonderful but good."

Now that I live in the Aurora/Naperville area, I have yet to find an establishment to replace this one. Their space is kind of tight, but I believe that to be part of the whole dining expereince. The ambiance is very warm and cozy. The wait staff is always very freindly, the food is fresh, and the menu is enormous. I&#39;ve never been unhappy with any of the meals that I&#39;ve ordered (and believe me, I&#39;ve been there for all three) in all the years that I have been a patron.

Christy&#39;s has a very family-owned diner feel. I&#39;ve only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated maybe twice, every other time we got a table immediately. The wait staff is great, they&#39;re very personable and go above and beyond what is expected of them. They&#39;re always super sweet to my kids and have brought out extras for them a few times. :) They have a big menu, so you&#39;ll definitely find at least a handful of things that you like. I always have trouble deciding what to get because everything looks and sounds so delicious!! Wait time is minimal, we usually get our food within 15 minutes. The food is always fresh tasting and delicious, no matter what we order. Their omelettes are absolutely amazing, the eggs are always so fluffy and they are packed with ham and cheese. Their crepes are to die for, and their milkshakes are thick and delicious. You really can&#39;t go wrong. Price-wise it&#39;s very affordable, and I always end up bringing food home because the portions are huge and I can never finish it all. I love Christy&#39;s and will continue to bring my family to eat there often!!"

We still came back, but far less often.  So, we decided to stop in this weekend for a light meal.  Being on a diet, I went to the diet secion of the HUGE menu and figured I would be safe.  Not so much.  First, they don&#39;t tell you this, but they are using milk or cream (and not skim milk) in the egg whites.  I know because I got sick afterwards and only get sick with full fat milk.  They also pre-butter the toast, which is normally fine, but on a low-fat meal that is advertised that way, they should be more attentive.  The peach halves that they serve on the plate are canned - and in heavy syrup.  I am thinking that there was nothing low cal or low fat about this meal other than the water I drank.

We also waited quite a long time to be seated, despite two open tables right in plain view.  Once seated, we had to scavenge our own menus because the host got distracted with talking to some regulars about what channel they wanted on the television. 

That being said, my mom enjoyed the waffle fries (Same as ever) and her soup and half sandwich.  Only $14 for the two of us, which is really cheap for lunch.

Sad that this place is not what it used to be - I guess if you are not concerned about calories, etc, you would be fine with the 95% fried or breaded menu and would be giving the place more stars.  I&#39;m just a little more critical of truth in advertising."

I&#39;ve tried over 15 pancake restaurants in the Chicago area.  Christy&#39;s Pancake House gets the first five-star rating ever without having five-star pancakes.   The pancakes were great, but a bit too heavy otherwise perfect.  Christy&#39;s has a small-town diner atmosphere where the locals gather and the staff is friendly.  They have a tremendous value and breakfast selection.  The great food, service and to top it off, the customer punch card, which will definately keep me coming back for more!

Pancake (original) **** great taste, a bit heavy otherwise perfect
Sausage (links) ***** big and tasty

I don&#39;t eat a lot of beef so I like having the option of turkey, veggie, elk and other burger alternatives. Especially during Lent, I like the fish and chips and grilled tilapia sandwich. However the tables here are sometimes sticky and on our last trip, both of the electronic pop machines were completely out of ice. We had to let someone know so we could fill our cups the first time. Ketchup needed to be refilled too. Other than that, just an average experience but expected for what we paid. The sandwiches here, in a meal (with fries) are huge and enough for two people without big appetites to share. Pecan coconut cookies were unique and delicious.

We had a coupon for a discounted meal, and it was right across the street from House of Brides. The restaurant was virtually empty so we were able to place our order right away. While we were placing our order, the cashier was complaining about wanting to go home. 

We placed our order, and I saw a proverbial halo of light over....free liquid cheese! Yes, folks. If you do not mind cheese fry cheese, you can have a free add on to your plain burger. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The burger was a little greasy and nothing special. I topped it with fresh items from the toppings bar. The wedges that came with the burger were great. I am a sucker for potato wedges, and this had a nice seasoning on it.

This is not my typical stop, but it is one I will consider."

I opted for the mushroom swiss burger on a regular bun.  I wish I had substituted the pretzel bun because once I had it in my hand, I realized that the bun was just sooo soft, it was starting to disintegrate and I couldn&#39;t put it down.  

Fries and onion rings were nothing special."

Mediocre experience with mediocre service with mediocre burger. The bun was good and the toppings bar was well stocked and fresh. That&#39;s the best I can say about this visit. Ordered a burger medium rare, no fries, no drink. It&#39;s nice they have the coke freestyle machine but I didn&#39;t feel like ponying up an additional $3.79 for fries and a drink today. The food pager vibrates and I&#39;m excited to get my burger. It&#39;s got cheese on it and fries. I ask if it&#39;s my order and am told yes. I ask again if it&#39;s mine and medium rare; that I didn&#39;t order cheese or fries. The gentleman says that they assigned the same pager # to two orders and hands me a different burger with a pink stick in it. I cut into the burger and it&#39;s well done, no pink whatsoever. I bring the burger back up to the counter, the employee sees it and apologizes and asks for another burger medium rare. I&#39;m given the second burger and asked to cut into it to make sure it&#39;s to my liking. It&#39;s raw. I show him and he agrees and asks the grillman again for medium rare. They take the cut burger, throw that burger back on the grill and give it back to me. It&#39;s now medium well where I cut it and medium where it wasn&#39;t cut. I had enough. I ate my burger with what was remaining of my lunch time and left. Definitely not a typical Fudds experience but I won&#39;t rush back to this location.

 For some reason, pricing is a different pre-tax on the combos between this location and the Northbrook location. A 1/2lb burger combo here is over $10 while the Northbrook location&#39;s combo is less than $9."
fuddruckers-schaumburg,Robby W.,QC_g-og4viJ9gjK2pjJteg,"Hoffman Estates, IL",1,1,1,198,4,-bns9wsjgir9n7DZcG_lEA,4.0,2015-08-10,"I have been to numerous locations of this restaruant since I was a little kid. When I was a teenager, the local Fudds was right smack dab in the middle of a stretch of road that was a popular hangout on the weekends with us teens, as well as car enthusiasts who would bring out their freshly waxed machines to display. I have so many awesome memories from that time in my life, so I am admittedly a little bias in my review here because of the nostalgia factor. Sue me. 

Fudds has not changed much at all in the 10+ years since I have been a customer. There has been some minor variations, but the focus is and has always been on great hamburgers. Red Robin, 5 Guys. and numerous others places have desperately tried to imitate this formula but their burgers simply don&#39;t stand up to the challenge. This location, like every other Fudds I have been to, grinds their own meat in house, and they are some of the most delicious hamburgers you will come across. They also make their own buns in the attached bakery.  How Fudds seasons their burgers is the subject of some dispute, with websites like &#34;Top Secret Recipes&#34; claiming to know how to replicate the seasoning mix. This is all BS, as I have tried this out and it is not the same. I have also had numerous employees tell me that it arrives at the various branches without ingredients listed, so even the employees and managers do not know for sure. The only one who does know for sure is the Phil Romano, who founded the chain.  

What I really love most about this place is the extremely fresh topping bar, as this is what sets this place apart from the competition. Fresh tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, onions, etc, are all on tap here, allowing you to pile it high with what you love. Also on the opposite side are the various sauces and the notable hot cheese sauces which are awesome to dip onion rings or fries in (though Fudds fries are more like potato wedges really). 

I was sad to see that this location no longer has the &#34;one pounder&#34; burger on the menu, just the 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 pound varieties. They do still offer it,  and they did have one made up in the meat case to be viewed. The patty has a circumference about the size of a volleyball. It has been since I was about 16 since I attempted to eat one, but that is one piece of nostalgia I am not planning to recreate. 

The interior of this location was extremely clean and the decor is a thematic throwback to a 1950&#39;s malt shop. Staff here was great, and they kicked out my food in under 15 min, which is not bad for a busy place on Golf. 

If you are looking to splurge on some unhealthy food, Fudds is a great spot to indulge."

The food left quite a bit to be desired. All the burgers at my table were over cooked. My dad ordered medium rare and I ordered medium. Both our burgers came out brown all the way through. The chili fries were not good at all, we didn&#39;t even eat them. Rather onion ring basket came with very few onion rings and they were not even crispy... Just soggy and greasy. Gross. 

You get much better food at a much better price with a much cleaner environment at a smash burger or Tom and Eddie&#39;s. I won&#39;t be returning to Fuddrucker&#39;s any time soon!"

It was the Kobe burger and not only was the burger nothing special (a little dry)  but the roll it was served on (which was not the usually excellent roll they have but a whole wheat roll) was dry or even stale!  It tasted like something you would pick up in a buffet line.
When the manager stopped by and asked about our meal I told he what I thought and she replied that all their rolls were freshly made.  WRONG!  Not this one.
She told me that if this happened again to ask for a replacement.  I should have but I was hungry and I ate it.
It is highly unlikely I will ever order a Kobe burger again.  BTW, they never asked if I wanted a whole wheat roll and I don&#39;t think it is mentioned on the menu.

Off the manager&#39;s recommendation, I had an elk burger (medium rare) with grilled onions, cheddar cheese and a side of and sweet potato fries.

I just assumed it was one of those SUPER tasty, quadruple beef patty, triple-heart bypass surgery places, but its not. They have plenty of relatively healthy choices, depending on what you order. I was pleasantly surprised this place offers Buffalo burgers. Lean on fat, and HIGH on protein, this is the way to go, if you&#39;re looking for a healthier option. They also have relatively healthy choices like the turkey burger as well.

Like I said, I&#39;ve been deprived, so all of this might be old news to yall, but I figured I&#39;ll be thorough anyways. You order up front, pay, and then they give you one of those flashy pager things that look like a coaster. Pick your seat, enjoy the scenary, and wait for your pager to flash. Once they summon ya, go back to the front counter and grab yo&#39; food! 

The wifey ordered the turkey mushroom burger and I ordered the buffalo burger. When I was called to pick up our food from the front-counter, the employee behind the counter pointed at one of the burgers and said that it was the turkey burger (this is important, I&#39;ll explain later). They got malt vinegar, hot sauce, tabasco, and then a full-on salad bar like setup for your toppings. They include lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, banana peppers, onions, relish, etc. and then the condiments include mustard, honey mustard, and ketchup.

The burgers are HUGE! Its not one of those thinly sliced meat  burgers... these burgers were at least a couple of inches thick (thats what she said). When I first bit into my Buffalo Burger, I thought it was somewhat bland. Well, it turned out the person behind the counter told me incorrectly which burger was the turkey and which one was the buffalo. Let me tell you, in terms of flavor, HUGE difference. It&#39;s kind of discouraging though, to know that their turkey burger was so bland. Anyways, the Buffalo Burger was awesome. It was flavorful, cooked to a &#34;medium&#34; perfection, how I asked for, and was extremely delicious. I was pretty impressed. I also ordered a regular order of sweet potato fries and they were delicious as well.

I&#39;m picky about what and how much goes on my burger, so the toppings bar is perfect... I don&#39;t have to give a presentation on how I want my burger, I do it myself.  The meat is high quality and true to weight (unofficially measured with my stomach).  I like thick &#39;steak&#39; fries and this place does them great.  Chili is good and premium toppings are great.  My family of four all love this place and it&#39;s nearly impossible to get us all to agree on a place.

Bathrooms: Well, when things get busy, employees don&#39;t and can&#39;t check the bathroom every 10 minutes.  To those that are complaining, it is a very legitimate complaint, but I would suggest taking it up with the manager before unfairly dinging them for some slob who forgot to flush the toilet when it was busy.

Fuddruckers: Maybe a bathroom log or something in a clearly visible place to address the other reviewers&#39; concerns about cleanliness.  You need a similar thing for the toppings bar, as I&#39;m sure that gets sloppy (and dirty) when you are really busy.  Your product is too good to let solvable problems that are within your control, ruin what is already a low-margin business."

The line for orders was very long @ 7pm, this isn&#39;t unusual. but usually it moves quickly. Not this time. So, I sat with the group I was meeting there.  I checked back several times and the line didn&#39;t get shorter until after 8p. In fact checking back the line was out the front door. I have never seen that in a Fudd&#39;s.
There were people in my party who had ordered before 7p, had not received their food as late as 8:15p. 
The floors in the dining area were slick enough to ice skate on, the tables and chairs were sticky, and tables were not being bussed in a timely manner

Kobe burger was nice and juicy.  Buffalo burger is really good too.  They used to have an ostrich burger, which tasted very much like beef but 1/3 the fat. Sadly, they no longer offer this one.

I also love their potato-wedge seasoned fries, really yummy

They have a Coca-Cola Freestyle, if you like hi-tech soda fountains.

Nice staff, they took our trays for us and thanked us for coming.

I ate here out of sheer curiosity, and visited the restaurant about an hour before closing time.  The dirty mop bucket and cleaning supplies in the front window by the entrance should have been a turn off, but I entered against my better judgement.  The fella at the register barely spoke audibly, and clearly hated working there.  Our food was fully cooked, but mysteriously completely cold; picture a cold cut sandwich shaped like a burger.  We left less than halfway through eating our meal, and left it on the counters, with no concern about how quickly we finished, or as to why more than half of the food was still on the plate.

I contacted customer service online to rectify the issue, but never received a response.  Just pitiful.  The price was quite high as well, on top of the lousy experience."

It&#39;s all self service, they give you a fancy buzzer, which vibrates when the food is ready, the shake is just served to you, don&#39;t need to wait for the buzzer.

My favorite things about Fuddruckers:
1) Amazing sweet potato fries (the large order, of which, is ENORMOUS)
2) Amazing foot-long Dogzilla (which for some reason doesn&#39;t seem to appear on the main menu, but you can order it)
3) Variety of burger options (beef, elk, buffalo, boar, turkey) and when you order your burger cooked a certain way, it actually comes out the way you requested. You can choose a certain burger or build your own. You can order different sized burgers too, like 1/3lb, 1/2lb, and beyond. 
*Did I mention how amazingly delicious the buns are?? Down to the buns! They are amazing. [especially the Dogzilla&#39;s] They grill them so they are rich and buttery with so much flavor, I can eat the bread by itself. 
4) The massive collection of condiments available at the condiment bar up front. You can help yourself to as many pickles, jalepenos, banana peppers, and  fresh salsa as your heart desires. 
5) The large selection of sauces available for dipping. They have the basics like yellow mustard, mayo, bbq sauce, and ketchup, but they also have nacho cheese, jalapeno nacho cheese (so good), and spicy mustard (amazing). There are stacks upon stacks of little dipping cups so you can take as much as you possibly want.
If you are a person who likes potato wedges, those are great too, and the onion rings are really amazing. Nothing all that special about the desserts (shakes, rice crispy treats, cookies), but after consuming the amount of food they provide, you may not be all that interested, haha. They also have great root beer floats. 
When you walk in and place your order, they provide you with a pager so you can go up and grab your food when it is ready, but the shakes/floats are brought to your table (they give you a sign with a number to place on your table when you order). I have occasionally had mistakes with my order, but they always fix it fairly quickly. Also, they have fancy touchscreen soda fountains that offer dozens of soda options, and also have lemon wedges)
The atmosphere is really fun and divey, with lots of vintage pictures and signs to check out, and if you are lucky, you can claim one of the massive corner booths. A great place to eat if you have kids with you (lots of space, moderate noise level). The food is not the cheapest, but for the amount that you get, I would definitely consider it a bargain. (1/2 burger with large side of sweet potato fries and regular-sized side of onion ring was $13). Long story short, check this place out! It is definitely worth it. I have been here many of times and it is always a nice experience!"

First, the arrival of &#34;Fast Casual&#34; burger places like Smashburger, Five Guys, etc.  These places charge almost the exact same price (about $10) for a Burger, fries and drink as Fudds, but those places are closer to a Burger King  in results than to this place.  Secondly, Fudds has improved greatly.  Burgers are freshly cooked, the &#34;fixings&#34; are kept fresh, and the selection of alternate items has improved a lot.  The basic 1/2lb burger is still the standout - just good meat, cooked as you request, with lots of free toppings.

My personal favorite is the 1/2 pound, works burger which comes with cheese, beacon and mushrooms.   

The wedge fries are also really good and I like the seasoning they put on them.   Especially when they are dipped into the hot, jalapeno cheese sauce.  

I only wish there was a Fuddruckers closer to me for we need to take around a 45 minute drive to get there... but it is well worth the trip.

5 stars on customer service. Really nice people were working when we went in, plus they clean up often and check in on you. They also offer an open topping bar and free cheese for your fries.

3 stars for flavor. The bun was perfect, the burger was good--- I loved the wedge fries and they had great flavoring. I will say that the cheese for the fries was lacking any flavor whatsoever. If I ever end up here again, I&#39;ll probably try the guacamole burger to give it some life...

I actually came away with one of the cheaper tabs, with a little over $13 for a bison burger, fries, and a milkshake. The burger was alright, but nothing to write home about. I hated my over-seasoned fries and didn&#39;t even finish them, resulting in a fine from the Clean Plate Club. The only bright spot in my meal was the cookies and cream milkshake, which was stellar. 

Even with a lunch full of disappointment, I was far from being the big spender of the day. Because Fuddruckers likes to nickle and dime their customers on burger additions such as mushrooms and grilled onions, many of my coworkers spent nearly $20 on their lunch of a burger, fries, and shake. That is utterly ridiculous. 

The lunch bunch at the office already made the executive decision to kick Fuddruckers out of the Friday rotation. We will do our taste buds and wallet a favor and stick to Portillos and Smashburger for all of our lunchtime burger needs."

The food takes a little longer than I would like.  But, the buns are soft, fresh and melt in your mouth good!  The wedge fries (dipped in ranch dressing) are a guilty pleasure.  My son ALWAYS gets a chocolate shake - so I have had a sip or two and it&#39;s pretty good too.

this review is ONLY for this location-
 
this place is confusing in terms of &#39;labeling&#39; the restaurant as dining in or fast-food.
price-wise, it is not cheap to eat here, about similar price range as five guys.

food-wise, for the burger, this place beats five guys anyday, simply because this place cooks their burger to your liking. (and i really like medium burgers)

burger was cooked to perfect medium, and bun tasted freshly baked.
for burger and bun alone, this place has some high quality-tasting burger.

however, potato wedges that were served aside were merely(literally) a few pieces, i was full after eating them and you probably don&#39;t need more than what they serve, but i still want my fries to be well-portioned (*cough cough* like five guys)

a few reasons i won&#39;t give this place 5 star: 
*priceyness 
*i wanted more potato wedges than a few pieces. =(  - (i dont know why they could be skimpy on potato, they are really cheap...)
*veggies that are self-served taste too cafeteria-like. and other toppings were kinda meh.

-service: really good, super friendly. everyone seemed happy.

-food: top notch burger and bun; toppings are meh. skimpy fries.

overall, recommended!

i am gonna try ordering burger from fuddruckers and get my whole greasy bag of fries from five guys. and run for 6 miles after that."

After eating hovered over my plate as the liquid made a waterfall onto my plate, I opted not to eat the now drenched and soggy fries.  Not a loss, as they are seasoned and wedge style.  The soda machines are also a pain in my ass. It&#39;s the single serve computerized one that is becoming popular, but which causes major backups while grandpa or junior make what is apparently the biggest decision in their lives as to what to drink.  Only two machines creates a huge delay.  We went to get dessert from the counter on the way out and not only did we have to get back in the main line to order (and then come back to the same counter) but we weren&#39;t offered them to go and then the guy disappeared.

I always get the cheapest burger combo.  They have a nicely toasted bun with fries.  I like how they have a burger bar with toppings that you can put.  I always skip the toppings that they offer...the burger can get too messy and I dont like that.  I always put some veggies on my fries and nacho cheese on them.  I cover them with it with extra, extra Jalapeños.  

My one pound burger story.  Went shopping near work, got a one pound burger...it was huge....Seriously huge.  I am a big guy...but I was full...especially because they gave unlimited refils on the drinks.  Stay away from this burger if you have eaten something that day.  I might try it again after an intense workout though....

All the people are nice and the theme of the restaurant is cool.

Overall a good place to go for a burger."

This particular location has been remodeled since the last time I was there, and looks very nice... although I do miss the 50s/60s motif that used to be the thing there, having had booths dedicated to the Stones, the Beetles and more.

The burger was so good that I craved it again today and decided to pay a visit to this location closer to work.

The verdict is that the burger is just as good as it was at the other location. This location was missing the ambiance and the route-66 vibe, but it was more spacious, and dare I say cleaner.

A little nervous trying buffalo patty for the first time, but it definitely didn&#39;t disappoint. Obviously more lean than beef, but it didn&#39;t detract from the full flavor of the burger, and that&#39;s a WIN in my book.

Funny thing happened though, my coworker somehow missed the condiments bar today, even though he passed it going to get the soda! Needless to say, don&#39;t be like my coworker, help yourself to the plentiful condiments, and fresh tomatos, lettuce, onions, and peppers!"

I took the family to this place this weekend after a visit to Legoland. This was my second time back to a Fuddruckers in 2 years and the impression remains the same.

The service is extremely slow and the food is a 1 on a scale of 1-5. The prices are absolutely ridiculous!

- Burgers - worst I&#39;ve ever had!

- Fish - over greasy and tasted old and as though they sat in the fryer way too long... Hell I am a chicken wing guy and I would not even eat more then half of either because of the grease.

- Fries - soggy and tasteless.

There are just too many places to get good food for $10.00 per person! I give this chain a few years before plywood is up over the windows at all the locations."

I love their specialty burgers.  You gotta love a place that delivers a good bison or ostrich burger!  The fries are really good, and you can&#39;t go wrong with a restaurant that lets you get as many cups of liquid cheese as you want for your fries.  Mmmmm, liquid cheese...

I love all of the toppings you can put on your burger.  Oh the creations I could make!!

Service is good.
Place is spacious.
The open topping bar ROCKS - good variety, fresh, and the sauces (jalapeno melted cheese, bbq, honey mustard, etc) are great.

The turkey burger was nothing special. The chicken sandwich was OK (bun was amazing) but again nothing too great. And for $20 for 2 people (2 burgers, 2 fries) I expected a bit more. The turkey burger + fries combo here is almost the same price as Cheesecake Factory but CF&#39;s turkey burger is 10x better.

Of the other hamburger chains (e.g. Red Robin, Smashburger, Culver&#39;s) we like Fuddruckers the most. The burgers always taste great. We wish, though, that they did not change the breading on their onion rings. We prefer the old recipe (which I believe was beer battered). The new recipe tastes more like seasoned bread crumb."

They have better burgers than your fast-food chains of the world and do not have a $1 menu. You get what you pay for.  They have 1/3 pound, 1/2 pound, 2/3 pound and 1 pound burgers. Compare a McDonalds quarter pounder for $3-4 or you can get these freshly made while you wait burger for about $1-$2 more (plus they&#39;re bigger)  They have endless toppings to build your own burger the way you want it...perfect for picky eaters.  Even hot cheese (love them on my fries).  They also have an awesome Cajun Grilled chicken sandwich, definitely worth trying.  Everything there is good. Its not a dollar menu burger joint and theyre taste proves it.  There were 2 occasions where we waited very long and another when an item was forgotten when i picked up my order, but on both occasions they were sympathetic &amp; made up for it right away.

My wife and I disagreed on the burgers.  I still think the Portillo&#39;s burger tastes better.  She absolutely loved her burger.  Regardless, for a place that costs around $10/person, it exceeded both our expectations.

From the age of 6 and onward, when my parents would ask me &#34;Where do you want to eat for your birthday?&#34;, I picked Fuddrucker&#39;s every single time (what can I say, I&#39;m a cheap date!)  Now, I am a burger connoisseur.  I have had pretty much all of the &#34;top rated&#34; burgers in Chicago.  There is nothing better in the food world than a perfect cheeseburger...and Fuddrucker&#39;s is as close to Godliness as they come.  They cook the burger right EVERY time, the meat is nicely seasoned, it&#39;s cute as hell in there (I&#39;ve seen it go through two remodels...I miss the &#34;Music&#34; booths, but it still looks good!), the buns are beautifully butter toasted and FRESHLY baked...

And ummmmmmmmmm THE TOPPING BAR.  Now if that&#39;s not worth the price of admission alone, I don&#39;t know what is!  And because of it, I always have to order a side of fries (I&#39;m not a big fry person, but I do really like theirs) so I can make cheese fries.  I also invented &#34;pico fries&#34; because of this feature, wherein I dip a fry in liquid cheesy goodness and then dredge it through the free pico de gallo...DELISH.

And the oatmeal raisin cookie is the BEST I&#39;ve ever had.

Fuddrucker&#39;s, I&#39;m moving to LA, and I&#39;m praying your other locations are just as satisfying.  People may disagree with me, but my mind will never be swayed.  

You know that mural they have had since the dawn of time with the woman closing her eyes in deep satisfaction and leaning over her burger with the green margarita in the background (which when I was a child, I believed that was a lettuce leaf she was using to provide shade for the burger...I had a good imagination)?  That&#39;s me.  I am that woman.

What&#39;s nice about Fudruckers is their little bar-o-fixin&#39;s so you don&#39;t have to deal with the wilted lettuce, tomato you don&#39;t want, and too much onion that you get at a lot of places when you order a burger.

They have so much to offer including an extensive food menu and eclectic atmosphere.

I was overwhelmed with options and a fast moving line when I first entered, so I kind of felt a bit rushed to order. They mean business at 12:30pm and keep the line moving, which is good though. My stomach was telling me to get one of their delicious Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, but my mind said I should probably make a healthier decision so I went with the California wrap. 

In the end my &#34;healthier&#34; choice didn&#39;t really matter, because I chose a side of fries and the wrap was about the size of ginormous burrito. Needless to say, everything was really good! The fries were kind of sweet and salted perfectly. The wrap included fresh ingredients and was super delicious. For like $9 (including a bottle of water), this meal was really two in one. I took home half the wrap and half the fries and enjoyed it the next day for lunch!

Augustino&#39;s looks like a carry-out sandwich spot, but it&#39;s much more than that. They have flatbreads, pastas, and a full deli of goodness.

I loved all of the old school diners when I live out east and was hoping for the same here!

I ordered the Broccoli Cheese soup and Pastrami on Onion roll. The soup was thick and had a very odd flavor. I didn&#39;t like it, so I didn&#39;t eat it. The pastrami was ok, but the onion roll was super dry. 

The boy ordered Chicken Noodle soup and Auggie&#39;s Patty Melt. He said it was a pretty standard soup and he enjoyed it enough to eat it all. The melt was a little greasy. He&#39;s a burger lover, but didn&#39;t rate this one in his top list. It was just ok. The flavor was there and the cheese was melty.

The meal was ok for a takeout dinner, but it cost more than it was worth in the long run. That was a little disappointing."

I always see this place when I fill up my gas at the BP station across the street (which has the lowest BP gas prices in the area according to the Gas Buddy App). 

So the first thing I noticed is the fresh meat and cheese they have up front. That is pretty cool.

I love sub sandwiches and Italian has always been my favorite at any sub places. I noticed the person behind me and the two people in front of me ordered the same thing. So it seems like the popular thing to order here.

My sub sandwich was good. Not great, but it was good. I liked how they put a lot of onions in the sandwich. For chips, drink, and sandwich it was almost 10.00. Almost like Quiznos when ordering their Italian (which I think theirs is quite tastier).

Someone said that Portillos is cheaper then this place and I tend to disagree. I think they are about even.

One thing that really bothered me was that is was an older building and it seemed like it was outdated. They had an outside eating patio, but it looked outdated with outgrowing plants (I think the owners like plants because it looked like a jungle out there). Thus I am giving it 4 stars.

It&#39;s a good mom and pop place. I won&#39;t come here again, but you have to at least come here once."

I was excited since I love diners! Looks can be deceiving: this is a deli/restaurant that serves American fare (burgers, sandwiches).

I opted for the Build Your Own Burger with provolone, mushrooms, and stone ground mustard: my favorite!It&#39;s $8 and seemingly one of the few things that comes with fries. 

Being this was my first time, I read the menu, but the employee who helped me was a bit surly. When he asked &#34;Is that all you want on it?&#34;, I asked if there were vegetables like lettuce and tomato. He said, dryly, &#34;Well, it&#39;s build your own, so yeah.&#34; Erm... okay, guy. I explained it was my first time there and didn&#39;t recall seeing the veggies listed on the menu, nor did I know I had to ask for them specifically, as many places include those staples.

It didn&#39;t seem too busy at 6:30 on a weekday, but took 10+ minutes to get my order. Everything was piping hot, though.

The burger was pretty large (1/2#) and on a sturdy bun. The mushrooms were fresh (NOT canned!), as were the lettuce and tomato. The portion of fries was generous.

Overall the food was good, but the smarmy service makes this just an A-OK experience."

Time of my visit: Early dinner

This was my first time visiting the place.  I had high expectations as several people had recommended this place to me.  At this point I am not sure I&#39;ll be back.

Let&#39;s get to the food.  I ordered ruben (and there was issue number one, at $8.99 it did not come with any sides), so I asked for homemade chips, which added another $2 and change to my order...  At this point, the prices are at or slightly above a sit down place with a real wait staff, which this place is by no means is.  My girlfriend ordered Italian combo (which she enjoyed, but the taste was about the same as the famous midwest chain, I won&#39;t mention here, but here at a higher price).  At least the size of the combo was descent.  The second red flag was a quarter charge for water... Seriously?!  I get it, plastic cups cost money, but at your prices you can&#39;t give someone a free cup of water?!

Now to the food.  I must say I was not impressed with my ruben, it was not anything special.  Homemade chips tasted just like any other homemade chips I has ever had.  The food was not anything spectacular, about average.

Let me mention the service...  As it&#39;s a big part of restaurant experience.  The cashier, that took our order, was perky and nice, the guy who brought it out to us, had this look on his face, which almost made me asking him, &#34;blink twice if you are here against your will...&#34;  But yet when one of his friends showed up, he was all Mr. Social.  Look, I worked in a grocery store when I was in high school, you better believe it, if I was not giving customers anything other than 100%, my manager would have ripped me a new one (and yes, I am not that old, it was in late 90s, when I worked at the grocery store in high school).

Overall, it&#39;s not worth the money.  Sorry to say it&#39;s an overpriced joint.  For what we got, we could have eaten the same thing at a sit down place for less.

Price wise, food taste and service is a C-.  Barely above D, friendliness of the cashier gets that slight notch."

My daughter loves it and it&#39;s probably one of her favorite restaurants because of the italian ice and the decor.  She doesn&#39;t actually really eat the food from here, maybe an occassional nibble on a burger, but she always demands we go if we are passing by.
The ordering system is a little wonky at times because people are slower and then you have to awkwardly pass them so you can pay.  I&#39;m not sure how it could be done better, but when it&#39;s packed it&#39;s a big pain.
Other than that it&#39;s a pretty standard restaurant.  The Italian beef is delicious and so far I haven&#39;t had anything I didn&#39;t like.  The house made chips are also yum.
The kids meals are nice for the kids because it includes a drink and the Italian ice.  Parking can be a little bit crazy because the lot opens into Schmale as well as St Charles."

Décor: This being my first visit to an Augustino&#39;s I had no real idea what to expect... and boy was I surprised haha. They have kind of a cheesy rock &#39;n roll, 1950&#39;s motif going on but inside and outside. It&#39;s a bit more strange that than, however, because it isn&#39;t trying to be &#34;authentic&#34; or period-correct, it&#39;s trying to be cheesy. There is a bunch of stuff on the walls and such and a giant guitar in a glass case and the dining room has a Marilyn Monroe statue in the middle... it&#39;s pretty bizarre... but ultimately &#34;fun&#34;, I guess. Anyway, everything was well taken care of and clean, so I certainly cannot complain.
Bathroom: decently well looked after, clean, and well lit

Staff: The sandwich guy and cashiers were both friendly and patient (I ordered my sandwich ass-backwards) and the &#34;bus boy&#34; (kid sweeping the floors) was also nice.

Food: We had a Turkey Burger (BIG burger, very tasty) with cheese fries (dynamite cheese and fries) and an Italian Sub (HUGE and quite enjoyable) with homemade chips (enjoyable). The food was delivered to our table rather quickly and tasted just fine. The portions are pretty sizeable as well.

Value: Given the portion sizes I&#39;d say you leave here ahead given the prices.

This was an interesting place with, ultimately, enjoyable food. I could see us coming back here again."

The ambience and the decor goes well with the name. The food is good for a deli and the staff is friendly.

I got the typical Italian sub - was good. Felt like it was missing peppers. Big portion! Leftovers when I got home.

I&#39;m a sucker for italian beefs and when I&#39;m home and craving it, I end up going to this place. The first time I wanted an Italian beef, I mistakenly said Italian beef sandwich and gotten a cold cut instead (it was busy during lunch hour and I never bothered to check my order) 

Next time, I specifically asked for the Italian Beef -- and it was alright. Just the sandwich could be a bit dry. What turned me off is that cheese and hot peppers are extra and I asked for it in all my sandwiches -- coming home and opening them, it turned out only one of the 3 had both. One was missing it all and one had only cheese. 
For a 5&#34; sandwich that ran me over $6, I expect it to be a bit better. I think I&#39;m gonna get my next fix of italian beef from portillos from now on :)

When you walk in all you have to do is place your order at the deli counter, pay and get a number. 
They bring your food to you right at your table.
We ordered the following:
-hot pastrami thinly sliced piled on high on soft rye bread really good. It wasn&#39;t too salty.
-A side of sweet potato fried crispy and sweet. And it was temperature hot fresh.
-turkey club on wheat with a side of cheese fries. 
They also have a few flat screen TVs in the dinning area. This place brings you back rock n roll style. Memorabilia all over the place.  In the background you can hear 50&#39;s music playing too.

I was a bit apprehensive, but I went along with everyone else (Disclaimer: To all my Yelp brethren, if you have a hunch, make sure you go with it. 9 outta 10 times you&#39;ll be right. Be open to your nonyelp friends suggestions, but be wary! I speak from experience)

Anyways, my initial feeling towards this place is and has been &#39;eh.&#39; Everyone else raves about how good the sandwiches are, but I just really had never been a fan. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m not a big sandwich guy in the first place. 

When I ordered this time, I used the custom deli. I did not make the mistake of ordering their gluten free bread (3.00 extra charge), so that was a plus. I ordered the oven roasted turkey breast with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle. NO MAYO! 

My order was correct, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much better the sandwich was than the last time I went to Augie&#39;s. I was put off by the long wait as well as the 14 dollars that I paid. This trip, I only paid 6 dollars for a substanially sized sandwich (It was sliced Rye; no roll).

I&#39;m glad I gave &#39;Augie&#39;s&#39; another try; Everyone else swears by it, and I guess if I ordered some of their more famous subs maybe I would too. I would defintely take this over Subway (funny since 2012 how Subway has gone down in quality and up in price). I will definitely be back, just not during the lunch rush hour!"

My husband and I and our 4 yr old son ordered dinner to go. My son got a cheeseburger kids meal. He started chugging his chocolate milk and then tells me it tastes horrible. I smelled it and it smelled like urine... No joke. I gagged. I looked at the expiration date and it was two days expired. I was furious that my son drank it and could possibly get sick from it!
I went back to augustinos (around 8 pm) and I see the manager and about 5 other employees standing around talking and laughing. So they have time to talk but can&#39;t go through their dairy products to make sure people (especially kids) don&#39;t consume spoiled milk?? Real nice. 
I got my money back but I&#39;m still upset that something that SHOULD NOT have happened did!! I hope after I left they checked the rest of the milk.... I mean after their hilarious, oh so important conversation."

From the outside, that kitschy &#39;50s American diner vibe just doesn&#39;t do it for me. I mean, I&#39;ll deal with it at Portillo&#39;s, but it&#39;s not as overwhelming as it is here. 

Enter Yelp, which has some fantastic reviews of this place, as well as elaborating on their menu. While it may look like a &#39;50s diner, it&#39;s actually a rather fantastic deli. They have burgers, fries, patty melts, hot dogs, Italian beef, and Italian sausage. But they also have great deli sandwiches, house-made salads, marinated olives, marinated mushrooms (you want some of these, trust me), and several flavors of Italian ice.

Not only that, I have to acknowledge the fact that they do something pretty unheard-of for most places like this out here: their water/soda cups, plates, to-go boxes, and all the other accoutrements of your typical fast dining experience (particularly if it&#39;s carry out) are all eco-friendly. No more being awash in a sea of #6 styrofoam that you can only recycle if you take it to the Dart facility in North Aurora! COMPOSTABLE TO-GO CONTAINERS. Sure, I&#39;ve seen them before, but usually only at places like Blind Faith or the Whole Foods cafeteria. This is a normal (but awesome), unpretentious deli -- and they care about the environment, too. And they&#39;re open late -- you can have a deli sammich for dinner, not just lunch! SCORE. 

I am so very down with that. We ate in, and ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich and an Italian oven grinder. The oven grinder was listed as being a two-handed sandwich -- which it is. I had to take half of it home to eat for lunch the next day, in fact. The marinated peppers and the special oil and vinegar sauce they put on this sandwich are magical, and perfectly balanced. The French bread is the perfect toasted, crunchy texture, as well. 

The marinated mushrooms are also fantastic. Just a little garlic, with a fantastic balance of olive oil, vinegar, and herbs. The marinara on the chicken parm is beautifully seasoned, and the whole sandwich is fantastic. My SO ordered that, so I only had a couple of bites, but I will definitely order myself one in the future.

Prices are super reasonable. My Italian oven grinder was just under $6 and I&#39;m getting two meals out of it. Score again. 

If you ask for a cup of water, they will charge you $.25...but since they&#39;re using the eco-friendly cups (and I know those aren&#39;t cheap), I&#39;m totally fine with it. That&#39;s less than a postage stamp costs. I am happy to spend a quarter to support an awesome eating establishment&#39;s choice to use less non-biodegradable crap in their daily business. 

Woot woot! We will definitely be back for more. Can&#39;t wait to try their reuben and their Italian ices! :9"

I rarely eat inside, so the 1950s decor isn&#39;t the draw for me at all, it&#39;s the sandwiches themselves. They pile the meat on nice and high, which is probably the biggest selling point. The bread they use for the buns is great, and they top the sandwiches well, but the quality of the meat itself is what makes the sandwich so good. They have a nice variety reminiscent of an old school deli, but in my opinion they undersell that. Not sure why. 

This is my favorite go-to for Sunday afternoon football food, so if you&#39;re eating Subway or Quizno&#39;s (even Jimmy John&#39;s), stop yourself and go to Auggies!"

Immediately recognizable with its jukebox themed exterior from the outside, Augustino&#39;s has a wide and diverse menu of items to try. Over the years I&#39;ve been to Augustino&#39;s a few times, and I pass the place nearly every day. You might be wondering, &#34;Why did it take you so long to review it&#34;. Well, it&#39;s never been a place I&#39;ve been super fond of, at least not enough to go out of my way to visit on anything resembling a regular basis. The other reason is quite frankly I was unaware they had hot dogs. Yes, the &#34;frankly&#34; was a pun, and a terrible one at that.

In walking into Augustino&#39;s there&#39;s a large counter with a menu board above you and a lot of food preparation stations. Someone comes over to face you and asks what you&#39;d like to order. The hot dog served by Augustino&#39;s is called the Aug Dog, and I decided to give it a try. I paid at the counter and took a seat in the 1950s themed dining area. 

What&#39;s interesting about Augustino&#39;s Rock and Roll deli is that it&#39;s really more of a 50s themed restaurant than Rock N Roll themed. Objects that I spotted not quite fitting the Rock and Roll theme were a statue of Betty Boop, Marilyn Monroe and some Rock em Sockem robots. Shortly after looking around my food was ready and I prepared to dig in and try the Aug Dog.

This hot dog came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. There were two long but well placed tomato slices on the hot dog so that tomato could be tasted in every bite. There was a thin pickle spear placed in the center of the dog. The application of mustard, onion and relish was excellent, and there were a couple of hot peppers applied to the dog but not in such a manner that you could consistently taste hot pepper flavor without reconfiguring the placement of these toppings. The sausage itself was skinless and appeared to be Vienna Beef or Red Hot Chicago.

 I took my first bite into the dog and was surprised by the outcome. This was an excellent hot dog. The condiments were well applied outside of the peppers, the bun was soft enough. I wouldn&#39;t quite say it was a five star hot dog, but I would definitely stop and try the Aug Dog again. Four stars."

The meat is freshly cut for each sub as it&#39;s ordered, which makes it so much tastier than those pre-cut, pre-packaged meat subs from Subway.

I wasn&#39;t actually planning on eating here for dinner but It was unusually hot outside so I figured a cold sandwich would hit the spot. 

Compared  to the one on North Ave, this place is pretty small. The ordering process is kind of awkward too. You basically wait for your guy to make you the sandwich for you so you can pick it up and bring it to the cash register. I stood in the line and watched a few people walk ahead of me to the next guy that was open. 

I ordered:

Augies Italian Sub (6 inch) (Around 5 bucks): There are pros and cons to this sandwich, the bread is fantastic and chewy, its packed with different kinds of meat and the tomatoes,  onions, and lettuce tasted pretty fresh. Cheese was fine too. The problem I had is the house dressing, I normally expect italian subs to have some sort of tangy semi sweet zingy dressing. This dressing was just sort of salty which didn&#39;t go well with the salty meats and cheese already in the sandwich. In the end it still tasted fine. 

Chicken Noodle Soup: (2 dollars for a small): Had some sort of long wide home made fettuccine style noodle in it which tasted good. The soup itself was pretty generic and the chicken and vegetables were kind of lacking. 

In the end I&#39;m still not sure about this place, I&#39;m sure from the wide selection there are great items on the menu that I haven&#39;t tried so I&#39;ll keep going back to get a better idea."

It rubbed me the wrong way when we were paying for the meal the person at the cash register said &#34;and what do you want for your drinks&#34;, implying we had drinks. I asked if they were included with what we ordered and of course they were not but to be honest I didnt know since it was my first time. Just kind of felt like if someone wasnt paying attention they could get bamboozled.

The decor was great, sort of a 50&#39;s theme but yet they were playing songs from today. Kinda thought if you&#39;re going for the 50&#39;s theme we would hear, well, 50&#39;s music, apparently not. My mental model also pictured ice cream and poodle skirts but thats just me."

My husband and I stopped by on a Saturday night. The line moved pretty fast but was confusing with who was waiting for something and when you could move ahead to pay. I did like the &#34;sandwich guy&#34; who was very friendly and helpful.

It felt like a very long wait for the food. Our table was really wobbly and the chairs weren&#39;t comfortable for the long wait. 

The decor in the restaurant is great and we enjoyed looking around and enjoyed the music.

My club sandwich was disappointing. The bacon wasn&#39;t crisp at all, the bread was really dry. It didn&#39;t taste nearly as I expected it would. The homemade chips were coated in parmesan cheese, which I don&#39;t believe the menu included in the description. I don&#39;t like cheese so that was a bummer. (My husband did love them, though.)

The beef was ok. Lacked big time on the cheese. Especially since I was charged another $.85. I&#39;ve had much better beefs at Rosati&#39;s.

We have eaten in in the past, but pretty much exclusively call ahead and pick up now. They open rather early, even on the weekends, so you can call ahead and pick up a sandwich for lunch before work! When I&#39;ve had to do it early on a weekend, they&#39;ve asked me when I&#39;d like it ready, not just telling me a time, which I liked. Any other &#34;off&#34; time that I&#39;ve called ahead, I think they&#39;ve usually said 10-15 minutes, which leaves me just enough time to get off the phone and drive there. At dinner time I think they&#39;ve still only said 15-20 minutes, which isn&#39;t bad at all for being busy. And since just picking up at the counter, even if it is busy with the dinner rush, you don&#39;t have to deal with the line that others have mentioned. Quality is consistent, food is good, not crazy expensive. Honestly, we probably should expand our horizons a bit more with all their options on the menu, but we usually stick to the tried and true. My go to is usually the Italian sub, others in my family go for the American. Can never go wrong with cheese fries or breaded mushrooms. My husband loves the three bean/mixed bean (not sure official name) salad, he&#39;ll eat as much as I bring home. The last time we went, he thought he&#39;d try the sausage sandwich. (Based on the menu saying &#34;two hands&#34;, I think maybe it was the Maxwell and not Italian? But I can&#39;t recall at the moment.) Whatever it was, it was huge! At least a foot if not a few inches longer. But he was pleased with it. And that one they actually waited to assemble until I was actually there to pick it up. You know it&#39;s fresh when you see them do it! I think the only thing we&#39;ve gotten there that we haven&#39;t really enjoyed was the ravioli - then again it was for lunch the next day, so reheated which could change it a bit. But hey, everything else is good, and it&#39;s a deli anyway! Really no complaints here. Will continue to go back, and maybe even try something new!"

I was wrong.

My wife and I went to Augustino&#39;s for a late dinner... sometime around 8:30pm. She got a chicken sandwich and fries, while I got a roast beef sandwich with grilled onions and mushrooms, and a seasoned cheese sauce.

On the side, I had sweet potato fries. Maybe these don&#39;t meet some people&#39;s definition of &#34;real fries&#34;, but I don&#39;t care - they were crispy and needed only a little salt to reach perfection.

Now, the sandwich itself: The beef isn&#39;t thin and trending towards flavorless like Garibaldi&#39;s used to be (I only got it for the mushrooms!). Instead, the meat was sliced thick, and the marinade used for the meat was very good. The bread was lightly toasted; more importantly, it had flavor. The cheese sauce was thick, but not solid, and definitely had a little bit of kick to it. Fantastic.

My wife&#39;s chicken sandwich was thick, but still juicy all the way through - this is such a rare thing for white meat chicken sandwiches that I wonder if they brine the chicken before cooking. It came with a honey-mustard sauce that was strong on the mustard, and gave the sandwich (and fries) a nice, hot kick. Normally I&#39;m not a fan of hot mustards, so I was pleasantly surprised to be liking this sauce.

Next time, I&#39;ll try the cold cuts to see if they stack up as well."

The very best thing to get is the American sub in my opinion; however, everything else I have ever tried there has been great as well.  Not too long ago they had a po boy style wrap with breaded shrimp.  YUM.  It was the best po boy style sandwich I have had since I left New Orleans.  So many places here do a terrible job with shrimp since seafood isn&#39;t too common here, but Augustino&#39;s did a great job.  This location is the best in my opinion, but the West Chicago one is very nice as well.  It doesn&#39;t have the same &#34;old school&#34; feel to it, but it still is set up like a 50&#39;s diner and is just as nice."

Ordered a soup and a chicken parmesan sandwich.  Broccoli cheddar soup was watery and had to have salt added to it to give it some semblance of flavor.  And chicken parm&#39;s usually pretty straightforward and hard to screw up, right?  Well, more flavorless-ness.  Bread was a tad above average, sauce might as well come from a can from Jewel, and I&#39;ve had a better chicken patty on an airline.  Not to mention the presentation was just a sloppy mess.

As much as I love local sandwich places, especially places like this with a fantastic history in the community and decor that keeps me looking around, Augustino&#39;s under-delivered.  Definitely not worth the money - look elsewhere for a satisfying soup and sandwich."

Subs for everyone, tell them how you want it! They also have soup, pasta, burgers, wraps, salads, hot sandwiches . . . what more could you want? Many of the plates come with huge helpings of fries that you can share. Even the kid&#39;s menu items are fairly large. My little brother can&#39;t get enough of the mac n&#39;cheese, or the oreos on the side. I myself have tried a multitude of menu items, but my preferred dish will always be the turkey-bacon-club. It&#39;s big, tasty, and good-looking. If you&#39;ve got a sweet tooth but are looking for a healthier alternative to ice cream, try the Italian ice--and try several flavors! I like a mix of mango and strawberry, but they&#39;ve always got several choices. 

The best part about Augie&#39;s is the service. They are fast, always smiling, and super friendly. My family and I are regulars, so the owner always comes out to say hello. He even knows that my brother is picky and likes his chicken sandwich in a special way that differs from any other item on the menu, and we&#39;ve never had a problem getting it done that way. In fact, they made it wrong once and the owner himself came out with a new sandwich even though my brother didn&#39;t make a fuss. Augustino&#39;s is more than a restaurant--it&#39;s part of what makes this town home."

One thing we had which was just great, was homemade potato chips!  Yes, they are fattening, but what good food item isn&#39;t?

I have to agree with the other yelper who commented on the line.  They do tend to rush you, but that&#39;s only because it&#39;s usually out the door.  For some reason, this place is a big hit with all the contractors working in the area, so you&#39;ll see the painter, plumber, electrician, etc. trucks in the lot.

As mentioned, all the deli meat is sliced to order.  The french bread was nice and crusty on the outside and delicious and soft on the inside.  I had the Italian sub which was perfect.

It had been a while since I&#39;ve gone here and went back over the summer and picked up an Italian beef for my Dad and an American sub (minus bologna) for my sister. Now i&#39;ve read that the beefs are better than Portillo&#39;s (huge Portillos fan here) and my Dad also agreed. His sub did look rather tasty and I think the next time I go back I will have to get it. Augustino&#39;s has been consistently good throughout the years. It is a tad expensive for sandwiches - but worth it. They have great fresh cut fries and chips also. 

As stated in other reviews - this place gets PACKED at lunch time. It dies down after 1 or so - or at least it did when I went there. The parking lot is tiny so that fills up quickly. I think you can park in a &#34;lot&#34; adjacent to it but am unsure about that.

I thought the service was great, the guys who took our order could have been a little friendlier but I thought it added to the atmosphere. The ladies behind the register were a delight though, very helpful with a couple questions we had and just overall very kind. They even addressed people by sir and ma&#39;am... I like that.

My friend and I got the meatball sub and a turkey sandwich to share. Meatball sub was very good (I&#39;d ask for a little extra drizzle of marinara sauce) but the turkey was not very good at all. Because of the other great reviews I&#39;m going to let this one slide but the bread was that chewy should have been warmed or something kind of bread that makes you just want to eat the inside of the sandwich instead of suffer through the bite and tear motion over and over again. 

Couple more things:
Everything costs extra so if you don&#39;t want something on your sub when they ask you are saving yourself some $ (I just kept saying &#34;yeah sure&#34; because I didn&#39;t know)

Don&#39;t get your food &#34;to go&#34; if yo have never been here. I really loved the old-school art and even if you are eating by yourself there is at least ten minutes of looking around you could do before you get bored.

Italian ice should be avoided... artificial flavoring galore... eww."

You grab the menu, pick out what you want, tell the cute guys behind the counter, grab your ticket and pay at the register.  

They take your money, give you your drink, and tell you to sit down because the burger you just ordered is a POUND, and will take a bit to cook.

In winter, it gets cold ad there is always somebody standing in your way. That part I think they could easily fix, but apparently the great food overcomes this inconvenience.

The staff was nice, but taking a relaxed pace.  This is fine, I am in no rush, but it is worth noting for others.  It seems like most of the customers are regulars. 

The coffee setup was the standard packets and creamer, which I always find disappointing.  The coffee itself was pretty good.  The cups were on the small side, but the waitress did offer to fill up my thermos.  Too bad that was the last fill up I had offered.  

Apparently they have biscuits and gravy but it is not on the menu!  So I may have missed out.
I ordered two eggs over easy with bacon and pancakes.  This also comes with a side of American fries.  It appears to be cooked to order, which I really appreciate.  The eggs were cooked to perfection, the three peice sod bacon were nice and crispy.  

Sadly the pancakes were super dry and not very fluffy.  It took 4 pats of butter and a syurup packet to get them down.  Also, I hate prepackaged syrup."

Dee took our orders - she was friendly and intuitive. I had the Tuna Melt + pea soup. It came on toasted seeded rye (total YUM) and had 2 slices of cheese. They had just cleaned the fryer so no fries for us, so we got hash browns instead. Fine by me!

He also got the pea soup + a grilled Chicken sammy on Pumpernickel, no cheese. Sadly his bread wasn&#39;t the toasty goodness mine was. Still, both portions were hearty. We each had coffees and waters which were regularly refilled. So, yep, good service!

Our pre-tip total was $17.60.

I devoured half of my sammy - it was tasty and the tuna was plentiful - and took the rest for lunch today. All was great and was at least worthy of 4 stars ...UNTIL (&#34;TMI&#34; Alert!) we got home and I had to go straight to the restroom.  Ugh.

The outside of this place looks well-kept. The neon signs are in good working order. Inside, the look and feel is definitely of an old diner -- not old as in Golden Nugget, disgusting old, but more like a Johnny Rockets charming, authentic good old vibe.

I ordered the split pea soup, and the Uncle Bill&#39;s Bionic chicken sandwich, which was a grilled chicken sandwich, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and bacon. Even though I requested no cheese, they put cheese in my sandwich. But no worries -- the cook and waitress were extremely nice and offered to recook it, in which I declined as the cheese was easily able to be scrapped off.

The sandwich was delicious! The only thing lacking was the toasting of the dark rye. Because it was left untoasted, the bread quickly crumbled and I was left with a messy sandwich. But the chicken and bacon was cooked perfectly, and seasoned just right. It was one of the best grilled chicken sandwiches I have had in a very long time.

The split pea soup was great as well, although I have to say it was saltier than I would have liked it.

Overall, the food was still good, and the people were nice and friendly. If you&#39;re looking for diner food, without the Golden Nugget yuck, definitely check out this place.

BATHROOM REVIEW: Comprising of a one-person bathroom, inside was pretty roomy. The inside had a lot of rusty looking pipes, and had the look and feel of a really old bathroom. Sit or squat? Squat!"

The clientele is filled with some older singles at the bar, some families and in the back corner the morning we went was a motorcycle gang complete with their leather jackets. Bad@$$! Uncle Bill&#39;s has pictures and posters of Elvis &amp; Marilyn all over the walls here.

Uncle Bill&#39;s can get very full as it isn&#39;t very big. Prices are great though, portions are large and food is good though nothing to write home about. I love cliches. They have some specials written on a board in the back and I had one of said specials - biscuits &amp; gravy + two eggs. It was way too much food, even though I ate it all like a beast and just $7!

It is my first time so I was wondering if I should sit down or they will tell me where to go. Working in a restaurant industry I know a welcome smile at least is a must. Not here.

I sat (the awesome busboy told me I could seat where ever I wanted). He then wanted to take my drink order... I waited for the waitress though.

She came smiley and took the drink order.

She then came to take my food order. I got ribeye steak med well and hash browns . It came with soup or salad which I got cream of chix rice. My daughter ordered the choc. Chip pancakes... Ehhhhk the soup not so good. 

The Busboy kept my coffee full all the time.

Then came our order... pretty big pancakes... Choc.Chip are inside pancakes which is awesome. My ribeye came with the hash and a side of corn.. ehhhk didn&#39;t know it came with corn. Not my piece of pie. Not the best ribeye... and was medium.. =( I don&#39;t like pink! But okay !!!

Food was ewwwwk 

I think since I got something from the special board(ribeye) it came with dessert. (The waitress told me the customer next to us gave us his dessert so we would be getting two desserts) AWESOME!! Considering I have two daughters and they fight for everything. They had the chocolate ice cream. ... or should I say they TRIED... Because they didn&#39;t eat it ... don&#39;t know why....

Uncle Bill&#39;s Diner is exactly what it is. It&#39;s a diner. And there is an Uncle Bill.

You&#39;ll be smacked over the head with nostalgia from the moment you walk in the door. It&#39;s like a blast from the past that I&#39;ve only dreamed of, but never experienced. 

Until now. 

We have driven past Uncle Bill&#39;s Diner a bazillion times. And a couple weeks ago, we decided that we couldn&#39;t just keep driving past. So we pulled in the crowded parking lot and made our way inside. We went back again today, so I&#39;ll give you an overview rather than a total replay of one visit or the other. 

It&#39;s totally a diner. A long counter with stools loaded with locals eating breakfast. More tables and booths than I could have imagined squeezed in there. During our first visit, there was one booth available and we snagged it. This time, it wasn&#39;t quite as packed so we chose a booth. (The same spot as last time. We&#39;re creatures of habit.)

Anyhow, the servers work together as a team. There is no rhyme or reason. No actual pattern of who does what because everyone does everything. They are a well oiled machine. Operating in sync at all times. Pouring coffee, refilling sodas, taking orders, clearing dishes. 

Here you&#39;re a Honey or a Sweetie. It works. Don&#39;t question these things. Until you&#39;re a regular and they&#39;re calling your name when you walk in the door, Honey or Sweetie it is. No joke...it&#39;s like Cheers - where everybody knows your name and they&#39;re they&#39;re always glad you came...  Both times, people walked in and someone said &#39;Hi Joe/Bob/Jim!&#39; And this was echoed about four times throughout the joint. Awesome!  

There IS an Uncle Bill. He&#39;s a very hard working guy. You&#39;ll know exactly who he is.  

The booths aren&#39;t overly comfortable, but you won&#39;t linger. Get in. Order. Eat. And get out. They are busy. It&#39;s reasonably priced and nothing fancy. So far, we tried eggs over medium, hash browns, bacon, biscuits and gravy, skirt steak sandwich with fries, ham and cheese omelet and chocolate chip pancakes. 

Eggs were cooked perfectly. Hash browns and bacon standard but good. Biscuits and gravy were top notch!  Skirt steak sandwich was a mistake. There was nothing wrong with it, but this is really a breakfast joint so I wouldn&#39;t order it again. The omelet disappeared rapidly from my son&#39;s plate. I loved the chocolate chip pancakes!!!  Light and fluffy with a ton of flavor packed in. Yes please. 

They cook right in front of you so that&#39;s cool. 

I will be a regular here and some day, I won&#39;t be Sweetie anymore. I&#39;ll be good &#39;ol Jen!  I can hardly wait!"

Breakfast for dinner :)
Ordered 2eggs with bacon served with hash brown shredded on the side, with 2pcs of pancakes. Friend ordered french toast 3pcs. All fresh, delicious, no unneccesary ingredients. The best part, no cheese!!
Hot chocolate was great. Coffee was ok.
Not much service, which is fine, i did not expect/need much service at a breakfast place. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they are very nice and ask a few times if we need anything. The chef who made our food also came out and asked if i need more coffee, very nice!
Open kitchen so that you see how your food was cooked. And so that you know they are not serving you anything pre-cooked.
We went in 7:30pm knowing they close at 8pm, so it was a rush meal, we didn&#39;t want to bother them so long although they never said they were closing soon. 
Given a four stars for this first visit. Will come back again soon and figure out if they deserve a five stars or not."

And though the exterior may be revved up; the inside is pure return to the 60&#39;s, with wonderful, down home kinda cookin&#39; where you get a full plate and then some!

How fun is this? Well, the fun can be had in deciding which retro dish you plan to revisit. My consulting friend has been on a diet for weeks; he was about to keel. So, his reward to himself was breakfast here. I, supposedly, came with as the caloric police. Not!

Indulge! Get into the culture! Tomorrow is another day! Well, he outdid himself (and so did Uncle Bill) with a plate of corned beef hash, 2 eggs over easy, wheat toast, juice, and coffee. He groaned with ecstasy through his entire meal. 

And I picked something I haven&#39;t had in eons: the buckwheat pancakes and a side veggie scramble (but that really isn&#39;t what it&#39;s called). Though not formally introduced, I think I saw Uncle Bill shake his head when I was trying to explain what I wanted. Not to worry, our waitress was awesome! As was the coffee! 

Sure, we looked like outsiders. But we went with the flow. It&#39;s a campy little spot with it&#39;s own subculture and pretty great food. Clean, too! And you will likely take half your food home; they are very generous.

The place is decorated in 50&#39;s items and is a smaller but cozy place. The food tastes good and the French toast was very good. The reason for my 3 star rating was the staff. We asked for several recommendations as we had not been here before and they gave us there thoughts which was appreciative but the one waitress had a mouth and used several words that were not appropriate and we did not find funny. Several other comments were made when coming over to check on us that just left us shaking our head at this place. Not sure if it was just an off night but not sure I would want to bring kids there to listen to that. My wife was also uncomfortable and just made the whole experience awkward.
uncle-bills-diner-roselle,Janni V.,GKZw9pVMesGBRfCR7Q_bgw,"Roselle, IL",0,1,1,82,86,-MDNVMbAkN8eF_3zzhXgig,4.0,2013-03-12,"Food: I had the worst craving for hash browns. Sure, I cook all the time, but that&#39;s one of a handful of things I don&#39;t really cook for myself. If I&#39;m grating potatoes like that, I&#39;d rather make latkes. Generally, I&#39;ll do other things with potatoes that don&#39;t involve grating at home. I&#39;d never been here before, but I&#39;d read good things on Yelp, and it seemed like just the place to go to sate this craving -- reasonably priced, solid diner experience. 

Some days, you want experimental breakfast mashups, like tiramisu french toast. Other days, you just want fluffy buttermilk pancakes with no frills. This place is the latter (and yes, those pancakes are good). Food is well cooked, but not really seasoned much at all. I&#39;m guessing this is because it mostly serves an older clientele, who are probably very salt-conscious. There are salt and pepper shakers on the tables, so you can adjust as necessary. Hash browns were nice and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside; just what I wanted. Yay. Also, the coffee was good.

Service: It&#39;s a small place, with super &#39;50s decor and very friendly staff. As soon as I walked in, I was cheerily greeted and invited to sit anywhere I wanted -- even though they were clearly busy with people both sitting at the breakfast bar and at the booths/tables. It&#39;s a great place to people-watch, as well. Regulars were greeted by name, and the staff took the time to chat with them. I love that about places like this. It&#39;s very much not a modern place; the most modern thing about it is probably the fact that the &#39;50s rock n&#39; roll music that played came from the Sirius/XM 50&#39;s station, and so was much clearer than it would have been coming from a transistor radio. But otherwise? Old-school all the way. The short order cook was cooking at a flat-top grill that stood in plain view of all the customers, so if you sat at the breakfast bar, you got food and a show. 

Prices are more than fair, considering. If you&#39;re looking for anything fancy, keep driving. If you&#39;re looking for a very basic step backward in time, with really great service, stop in. They also serve lunch. 

(Oh, be advised that the breakfast items all come with &#34;American Fries.&#34; That&#39;s their term for hash browns -- not &#34;Freedom Fries&#34; or something that might show up on the Colbert Report.)"

Uncle Bill&#39;s is a thing of rarity.  Now that corporate restaurants are ubiquitous, it&#39;s hard to find places like UB&#39;s.  
They have a really small menu but it&#39;s good, cheap food.  They&#39;re not trying to blow you away or anything like that, but the food serves it&#39;s purpose.

With that being said, my sis had the navy bean soup (Greek fasolada) and she said it was really good.  My boyfriend and I both got the corned beef has with scrambled eggs and a side of pancakes.  It was good, just like home cooking.  Apparently they have the best biscuits and gravy (homemade). 

The waitresses are your typical &#34;hi, how you doin&#39;, honey?&#34; kind of waitresses.  I believe THE Uncle Bill&#39;s wife is one of the waitresses.  The owner is very nice and stopped by to talk to us, he was so nice!  The cook cooks your food in an open area, the kitchen is surrounded by a counter seating area.  You never really come across &#34;open kitchens&#34; like this anymore but it shows that they have nothing to hide (in terms of quality).  

Anyway, it&#39;s a good place to stop if you are in the area and are looking for a cheap, good meal or some coffee.  Is it gourmet? By no means.  Does it serve it&#39;s purpose? Heck yes!"

The prices weren&#39;t bad and the food was OK. It&#39;s typical diner food, mostly breakfast and lunch type items. I went with the steak and eggs. Eggs are pretty much always eggs and the steak wasn&#39;t bad. The portions were large enough to fill me up but didn&#39;t leave me feeling grossly overstuffed.

My father loved this place and swore by their biscuits and gravy. Maybe it&#39;s a guy thing, because my fiance is a fan of their breakfast foods as well. He loves the meat lovers omelet, which comes with all sorts of breakfast meats ham sausage etc.. a lot of their omelet&#39;s come with peppers and onions in the egg mix, which not everyone likes and I feel like it should be more clearly stated on their menus. I&#39;ve always gotten the waffles, they&#39;ve always been good. Being such a small place, they run out of a lot of their fresh fruit that&#39;s supposed to come on top of their waffles &amp; pancakes.. 

The only reason I am giving this place three stars instead of five is because of their staff. There have always been little issues every time we&#39;ve been here, but the last time we were there, our waiter left without giving us a check or refilling our drinks. We sat there for about 15min without any of the other staff saying anything to us. Finally we went to the little check out counter &amp; asked the little old man where our check was, instead of giving us a nice polite answer he started yelling about his employees leaving to go home without finishing their work. The whole situation was handled poorly, we&#39;ll probably be back, but no thanks to the staff."

I have past this place a trillion times down Roselle Road and never thought twice about stepping into the lackluster building. After going in there a couple weeks back, I am thoroughly ashamed to say I judged it by the appearance and regret not going there sooner! 

I got a basic breakfast staple: eggs over hard, hash browns, bacon and pancakes. You know they aren&#39;t counting calories which made the food so delicious! The best part is that you see exactly what they are doing to your food if you sit at the bar. 

I was craving a chocolate milk which was the only thing that disappoints because I could tell it was Nesquik powder. Why would I care about that? Because there were still chunks of powder in my milk (sigh). 

This isn&#39;t the place to for healthy conscious people. I left feeling overwhelmed with the amount of fat and butter I ate...

From the outside it doesn&#39;t look like much. For some reason we decided to go there for breakfast this morning.  We&#39;re both glad we did!

I had the meat lover&#39;s skillet - 2 eggs, hash browns, green pepper, onion, bacon, sausage, ham and I&#39;m sure there was some other stuff in it too.  It also came with your choice of toast, pancakes and a few other options.  I took pancakes.  My wife had 2 eggs, hash browns, toast.  We both thought our meals were great!  Good flavor and not greasy.  Even the orange juice tasted better than at most restaurants!  A bonus is that kitchen is right behind the counter so you can watch everything being made.  We both left full and it was all for just under $20.

The down side is that this is a 50&#39;s diner theme.  While the 50&#39;s music was amusing for a little while, it did get a bit irritating after a while.  But hey, that&#39;s just me.

We&#39;ll definitely be back!"

I do not like eating at this diner when the owner is helping in the kitchen. Let&#39;s jut say...I&#39;ve seen him completely disregard several standards for food safety and commit some egregious acts that cause me to question if dining there is wise. The wait staff is friendly and efficient, the busser and regular cook do a fantastic job, though uniforms for the wait staff and coats for the cooks and busser would really help to convey a more professional and cleaner atmosphere.....I get it...it&#39;s a cheap diner...but there are several other local dinners like Teddy&#39;s and Checkers who serve the same food but when I leave there I&#39;m not contemplating whether or not I may have contracted food poisoning. Basically it comes down to this....when this place is good, it&#39;s really good,but when it&#39;s bad it&#39;s horrid. Avoid Sundays. Go during the week . I like eating dinner here mid week when they are slow. My advice to the management is paint this place, ditch the old faded plastic framed posters caked with grease and replace them with some new ones, make your staff ware uniforms, clean the filthy ceiling vents, add a fridge in the kitchen area for eggs and prepped vegetables, repair some of the damaged seats in the booths, serve some better coffee and keep Bill out of the kitchen.."

I consulted Yelp today while in Roselle. The positive reviews got my attention, so decided to give Uncle Bill&#39;s a try for a late lunch. It was very disappointing, and it is a safe bet that this joint won&#39;t ever be featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on The Food Network!!  The place was virtually empty and the cook was lying down (napping?) on the bench of a booth by the window. I did not know he was the cook or I probably would have left right then. There was one middle-aged waitress and a younger waitress she appeared to be training. The older one was loudly complaining about another waitress who was not there at the time. The entire time I was there she complained. I ordered a Coke, a bowl of chicken soup and a cheeseburger. The Coke tasted flat, so she replaced it, but blamed it on their soda machine and said it is not like what I would get at McDonald&#39;s!  What does that mean?!  Isn&#39;t a Coke the same everywhere?!  While eating my soup - straight out of a Campbell&#39;s can I am sure - I saw the cook popping food into his mouth while he cooked my burger!!  As soon as he plated my food, he sat down at the counter, put on headphones and a backwards ball cap and commenced checking his phone!!  REALLY?   Although the burger looked okay, my appetite was lost when I saw this joker eating while preparing my food. Not a good impression at all. Maybe the place is better supervised when Uncle Bill is present, but it was a disaster without him there to keep an eye on his employees. I will not go

as we&#39;re mere days into the new year, i was of course nursing ideas of healthy eating and exercising, ad nauseum.  then i saw on the menu that they serve a patty melt with wedge fries,  and that was the end of that!  and believe me, it was definitely worth it to move my resolution start date back a day.

5 stars for great customer service, great food, and great price.  outer decor leaves something to be desired, but isn&#39;t something that i think is really necessary for a diner to have 5 stars when the service was so good, and i only paid $9 for soup, sandwich, fries, and a drink all made to order.  loved it!"

I came here with my co workers for lunch on a Friday and we all agreed that we wouldn&#39;t come back. 

The service was very very slow, it took us 35 minutes to get Mac and cheese bites, and they were mediocre at best. 

I ordered the California burger which is nothing but a burger with (not fresh made but more like store bought) guacamole on top, that&#39;s all. Pretty disappointed since the burger is over $10. The overall taste of the burger was a 6/10 at best, it&#39;s a $5 burger in my opinion, no cheese either! The tater tots were not bad, but the cheese sauce was way over microwaved and tasted bad. 

Getting our checks and paying took really long as well, nobody in our table was happy. I wouldn&#39;t come back, if i was you I&#39;d head over to Morettis, they have way better food and service and burgers are leaps and bounds ahead"

The bad parts: VERY slow service, there were 13 customers (yes, I counted), two bartenders, one server, one barback, and one bouncer, yet ordering a drink and having it delivered took 10 minutes. Just go to the bar. 
They dont actually have all the beer on tap they advertise. Again, just go to the bar to save your server coming back and telling you theyre out. 
DO NOT GET THE PIZZA, actually dont eat here. It&#39;s good for drinks, but the food has been a disappointment every time with the exception of the fish fry. Be willing to wait a while for your food though.
Be aware even though there are only 13 people there, they will turn the restaurant into a club at midnight. Remember that conversation you were having with your friends? Neither do I. They start blasting the music so loud it bisrupts your brainwaves, so dont plan on talking to anyone after midnight. 

Update: downgraded to one star because I got food poisoning from the fish.

Overall, good for a drink or two if you sit at the bar and dont have a server get your drinks, just eat before you get here and leave before mighnight if you dont want a ringing sound in your head the next day."

We weren&#39;t greeted right away when we came inside and the place had like 3 groups at the patio and a couple inside. When we got seated outside, we were informed that the Bartender was helping out the only waitress that was working. The bartender had to go back and forth from the bar to check up on us.

The food was okay and isnt much different from other bars in the area. They didn&#39;t have a drink menu available and the bartender told us that they&#39;re currently working on it.

I ordered a veggie wrap with steak fries. The wrap seemed to be stuffed with greens and onions, topped with some kind of balsamic dressing. It was good, but kind of odd that nothing else was in it. The steak fries were amazing. Mmm. Perfect portion for a dinner place -- $9 and I ate it all. My husband didn&#39;t like his chicken caesar wrap, though. Apparently it had a lot of onions in it? Odd.

Service was alright. Food was good, but not amazing. Prices were fine.

Fireside has a clean, upscale but not fancy pub feel. Lights dim at night.

I don&#39;t live in this area so it was a small trip out.
Saturday pm - cover was $7 to see the band.  There was plenty of room to sit in that area of the bar, the other bar was a little crowded, but not packed or anything.  The atmosphere here was actually pretty chill, totally my kind of place with that whole sports bar feel to it!  
It&#39;s always a bummer when bars don&#39;t have &#34;specials&#34; on Friday or Saturday...I get it, it&#39;s their money making nights over the weekend, but throw your patrons a bone, already.  This place DID have Saturday PM specials and we got ourselves these HUGE drafts of beer for $5 - made us very happy! There were other specials but I can&#39;t recall just because that beer special was pretty awesome.
There is outdoor seating here too, and they have a full menu which I have no idea about.  I would definitely come back here again, all was good in this place!"

You do wait a long time for your food. But after the second time I knew it&#39;s because they want it perfect. Each time the wings are awesome and the pizza was good. If you like brown cheese tell them keep it in a bit longer. But I have had pizza, the southwestern burger and chicken and shrimp pasta. All three have been perfect. I don&#39;t mind the long wait as I did the first time. This is a perfect place for any sporting event and living across the street I hope this place stays open."

Came here a second time with coworkers and it was a different experience. 
Which has made me go down to 3 stars.

Pros:
great beer selection
food is good pub food.

Cons:
jukebox offline (both times) 
crappy music videos / DJ that kept playing stuff from 2000-2002.
service that was hit or miss all night.

I feel that this place is unsure of what kind of bar it wants to be."

It was pretty early, around 5 pm, and e place was still pretty empty. They had a $5 martini special. I ordered the 50 Shades martini which was super sweet and weak but delicious nonetheless. They had a pretty big beer selection and it was reasonably priced. We ordered a couple apps that were sup par. The nachos had a lot of toppings but they all fell to the bottom in a mushy mess. The appetizer platter seemed like freezer snacks thrown in the oven and on the plate. This seems like the kind of place to go to for the drinks not the food. Service was not very attentive."

Poor wait staff, out of every beer we were interested in having and the food was not prepared correctly and cold. We should if realized when we walked in and a sign was posted help wanted  !! This could be a great neighbor restaurant but they need to get their stuff together. Smoking should not be allowed on the outside patio or within 15 feet of the entrance. Gross !! While we were there two other couples at tables near us got up and left....hello are you listening to what is happening to your restaurant."

Thanks to Gina for the tip on this place running out of things.  My wife and I were in the mood for wings.  The server mentioned that they were out of the bourbon sauce.  Bummer.  Gina - you called it.

Overall, if you&#39;re looking for a place to have beers or cocktails with friends, and don&#39;t care much about the food, then this place is just fine.  Go drink, enjoy your friends... no problem at all.  For that, I&#39;d give the place 4 stars.

BUT... this is a restaurant and a bar... we went on a nice summer evening, but wouldn&#39;t sit outside because there were smokers out there.  Sorry... that&#39;s just a fact.  The food is just OK.  Not horrible, but not tremendous.  As others have stated, after  couple of years of being open, this place should be packed on a Friday evening on a beautiful summer evening.  Why not?  I&#39;m guessing that the food is not scaring people off, but it&#39;s not brining them back over and over.

By the way, the wings were OK... good, but not a destination place for wings.

I think if they step up the food quality and overall service just a bit, they will be packed.

One more thing... making gambling available seems to be in vogue around here lately.  I&#39;m not opposed to gambling, but it&#39;s not going to draw me into your place just for that.  If I want to gamble, I&#39;ll go to a boat.  Otherwise, just give me good food and service at a reasonable price, and I&#39;ll be back over and over."

Not even edible. The only reason I gave them 1 star is because the mozzarella sticks were ok. Turkey Club is horrible. They don&#39;t use real turkey...it&#39;s slimy deli &#34;meat.&#34; The bread was buttered and grilled like a grilled cheese sandwich. Who does that with a turkey club? We ordered chips and salsa. How can you mess that up? They were just awful. The chips tasted stale and the salsa wasn&#39;t edible. My girlfriend ordered the fish tacos. She had to eat it with a fork because the shell fell apart. The fish itself had good flavor...she just pushed everything else to the side and ate the fish by itself. The rice was flavorless and a waste. We spent over $50 for this food and I&#39;m still hungry. UGH! Never will I eat from here again.

The service was great (Kimberly is super friendly!)  But the food is a downer.  I started with a half dozen oysters that were on special for $1.50.  To be honest, they didn&#39;t taste too fresh, and weren&#39;t shucked properly, having tiny fragments of shell on the meat. For the meal, I opted for the beer battered cod platter.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, but when I hear platter, I imagine huge portions. Not here though. There were 3 wimpy strips of cod, heavily battered, with a mediocre side of fries.  They came with cole slaw, which had a weird chemically-taste to it.  

If I had to give stars for the food alone, I would say 2.  But Kimberly saved the day with her service and attitude."

This is the second time I&#39;ve been here and the first time was mediocre but not downright horrible like this time was. I will say that our waitress was a sweetie with great manners and a cheerful attitude, and she was attentive enough, so this has nothing to do with service for me. They have a really nice outdoor patio so on Sunday evening I chose this place thinking, even if the food isn&#39;t the best, it&#39;ll be decent and we can enjoy the patio. Well, I don&#39;t know if this place has recently just given up on life or what but literally everything was awful. It almost seemed like it had to be a joke or something, it was so bad. We were waiting for another person to join our trio so I ordered the spinach &amp; artichoke dip in the meantime to have something to munch on right away. The chips were so stale they were chewy and the dip was clearly some packaged junk they microwaved and served lukewarm. Chips have to be laying around for QUITE a while to be that stale. How do you not know they&#39;re super old or serve them anyway? I couldn&#39;t believe it but hoped it was just that one thing. My husband and I split a BLT with tots and each ordered an additional soup. The chicken noodle soup had no noodles in it. Weird. My soup was tasty but definitely just something out of a can with a piece of mozzarella melted over the bowl. The BLT wasn&#39;t horrible but the bacon looked microwaved. It was flat as paper and looked like that pre-cooked stuff you throw in the microwave, or maybe it was just super cheap bacon, but the BLT was edible at least. The tater tots were under-cooked and barely even warm. They had that slight under-cooked potato crunch to them on the inside instead of being crunchy on the outside from being cooked properly. I forgot to mention that there were 4-5 people sitting at the bar and NO ONE else in the dining room when we got there, and this place is big. One other small family came and went in the dining room the whole time. Not only was this not a busy time but the place was completely dead and our food is microwaved and under-cooked? Why?!  You&#39;re tight on time in the kitchen? Have something better to do? Even during rush time the condition of this food would have been considered brutally terrible. Two of our people ordered burgers and fries, medium, and the burgers were a bit small and completely grey and dry. The one thing that was supposed to be cooked a little bit less was scorched to death. The fries were a bit soggy and barely warm. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with the chef in this place, and I know you don&#39;t have much to work with since they&#39;re clearly buying pre-made, generic foods, but please actually COOK the food! Spinach dip is so easy to make. Why, on a dead Sunday evening, am I served microwaved, barely even warm, dip? Just make some! All the food was so bad it was actually bizarre. The patio looks really nice and it&#39;s such a shame that this place is not putting out any quality at all because I would eat here often during nice weather if the food was good. They also have huge screens on the walls with games on so it could be a really great spot to hang out for games in the winter as well, but they&#39;re serving trash. At least if I microwaved a dinner for myself at home, I&#39;d be able to eat it hot. The majority of our food wasn&#39;t even edible. We paid $60 for two burgers &amp; fries, one BLT &amp; fries, 2 soups, spinach dip, 3 pops &amp; a cocktail. If business is hurting so you&#39;re pinching on quality as a way to save money and hoping no one notices, it&#39;s having the exact opposite effect you want to achieve. When people experience something that bad they&#39;re NEVER going to come back. Great food will make people overlook a lot of other flaws but no matter how great the place is otherwise, bad food will kill it completely. This place has potential to be a cool spot because of everything else it has going for it but without at least decent food it&#39;s going to tank very quickly. This area has tons of restaurants and there&#39;s no reason to go here with quality like this. I hope for their own sake they invest in better quality food and a decent cook or they&#39;re going to be goners very soon."

Always greet your tables within 30 seconds of them being seated, check on them after their first two bites and make sure to write things down to avoid asking the same question 3+ times. 

I&#39;m not posting this with the intentions of being negative or obnoxious, but genuinely trying to be helpful from years of experience in the restaurant industry.

I initially gave it three stars because I liked it, I now give it four because I have more visits under my belt and enjoy it. I stand by much of what I previously said: nice atmosphere, clean, Nate is great server, not much of a kids place, etc., read my previous review.
    I have tried something different each time I&#39;ve gone-- I&#39;ve gotten the brownie dessert: yummy! the chopped salad: red peppers are a great touch, the Caesar and buffalo chicken wraps as mentioned in my previous review: very good, the all-you-can-eat fish fry: good plus homemade chips, and most recently the traditional chicken wings with the dry Cajun rub on them: quite tasty and comes with either bleu cheese or ranch plus celery. I&#39;ve also tried things the BF and his bro have ordered such as the tacos ($1 tacos on Tuesdays) and chili, which they enjoyed immensely. (I&#39;ve posted pictures of most of this)
    I&#39;ve also chatted with a bunch of the wait staff, hostesses, bartenders, bar backs, and even the chef-- they really are a nice bunch and seem to do their jobs well. Sometimes things get hectic and mistakes can happen or people can have an off day, but they seem to be a good bunch. 
    As I previously reviewed, it can be really loud sometimes, particularly on a game night or when they have a live DJ playing tunes, but that is to be expected. On a regular night the volume is average, so it&#39;s not always like that, hakuna matata. 
    New addition to my review: the bathrooms! I went in them for the first time a couple of visits ago and they are so nice, new, and clean! I was quite surprised because usually bar-ish sort of places have kinda meh bathrooms. 
    I stop here, go try it for yourself. I really did like that dry rub on the wings.... mmm... well done, chef."

An order of jalapeño poppers took over 15 minutes to show up. How hard are jalapeño poppers?

The roof was leaking next to our table. It was also leaking last time I was there several months ago. I would think that would have been fixed. The restaurant was far from busy on a week night but it took several minutes for someone to greet and seat us. The BBQ ribs are to die for (probably why I continue to give them chance after chance). The staff is slower than slow. They have plenty of time to sit around and chat with each other; but they are very inattentive to their guests. What should have been a quick dinner as they were not busy, took 1:45. No one checked back to fill drinks or see if we needed anything. We had to flag down someone to get our check.

The negatives were the fairly loud house music playing and it took a long time for the food to come.   We ordered apps and various types of wings and it took 45 minutes, with not much &#34;competition&#34; in terms of others ordering food-should have brought the apps out earlier.   

Other than that, it&#39;s pretty good bar food-wings are meaty and sauces are good-hot buffalo and parmesan garlic.   The nacho plate was decent-large, but not a lot of cheese, sour cream or guacamole (mostly wilted warm lettuce).

When I first walked in I was greeted, and we were seated right away. It wasn&#39;t busy at all (it was a Sunday evening). There are plenty of TV&#39;s scattered around so you can watch sports/whatever else is on. There is also a large bar that you can sit at. They have a decent selection of beers on draft and a few bottle at a fair price. My friend had been here once before and said that she had ordered a few things that she wasn&#39;t too impressed with (french onion soup, nachos, burger, pasta), but they had made a few changes since then so we gave it another try.

Their menu is kind of crumpled (maybe they don&#39;t have nicer ones yet since they are just starting out). They also don&#39;t have prices on their mixed drinks menu - I don&#39;t like that. You shouldn&#39;t have to hide your prices. They have normal bar food to choose- burgers, sandwiches, soups, salads, wraps, pizza, a few pastas, and wings. I wouldn&#39;t say there is a ton to choose from, but enough to find something you will like.

I ordered the Western Burger. To be honest, it wasn&#39;t the best. The meat was overcooked and seemed like it was a frozen patty at one point. The fries were thin and greasy, and pretty limp. We also ordered the mac &amp; cheese bites, which needed some sort of sauce on it. Everything was pretty cheap, but the taste just wasn&#39;t there. Our waitress was good at first, but then it felt like we waited forever for our check (and like I said...it wasn&#39;t busy). 

I hope they can make some improvements so that they will stick around, but so far I wouldn&#39;t go back."

The pros, nice interior, the con&#39;s, food was horrible and the service was worse, even got attitude from the owner when I asked if he was turning the Hawks game on. Sorry for asking but the game is starting now, I see you are having fun playing DJ and all....

Back to the service, we sat at a table for 15 minutes before a server even approached us, manager even walked past us and didn&#39;t even acknowledge are lack of drinks. Its their job to monitor the dining room, they couldn&#39;t even get that right. 

I know when you walk into a bar the food can be iffy, but this place doesn&#39;t even come close to decent food. 

I won&#39;t be back, far too many other great places in the area."

They have specials here everyday of the week, so be aware of what they are. The staff was really friendly and helpful. We did order a couple of drinks to go with our food.  There were a few veggie options too, so couple of other friends were also very happy to order a sandwich and a wrap. We ordered the chocolate cake for dessert, which was nothing fancy.

Most noticeable here was: They had huge projection screens and projectors all around showing some game or other, which was really really cool. I can definitely see myself going here sometime in the future."

1. We were seated, but after 20 min. our friend had to ask if we could get some service.  The manager brought us a waiter, and we thought everything would be good now.  Not so much.

2. Food was terrible.   I ordered a chicken Caesar wrap, and the fries were stone cold and limp.  The chicken in the wrap was burnt to a chicken jerky consistency,  but some how they thought to serve it.  I never usually send food back, but it was inedible.  

3. My friends ordered the 2 for 25, and it comes with an appetizer, soup or salad,  and your choice of a shared or individual entree.  They brought the entrees first, appetizers second,  and we had to ask where the soups were.  What sort of orded is that.  At least the ribs they ordered were tasty.  

This was my first, and last time coming here.  If I want a place to watch the game and grab a bite... I would recommend anywhere else.   

I can comment that they put out a buffet at half time.  Our waiter never let us know that either.   

I hope they figure out their service and food soon.  Nice overall ambiance, and this place was closed for at least a year before this place took over the location."

We had maybe 20 people,  got there early and our table was reserved. 
So here are my complaints. 
3 of us got the wrong food
A friend got chicken alfredo and had a puddle of oil on the bottom. 
My wife ordered a beer, 30 mins later,  still never got it
They added gratuity to each of our bills
Never got any ice in our water cups
Staff was not friendly. 
So if you want to go there for a beer and some basic bar food,  it is not bad.

It&#39;s a sports bar, let&#39;s be honest, don&#39;t go here for non-bar food.

I was there on a Monday, the outside sign said 15% off entire bill, maybe it meant just drinks? Not sure but they didn&#39;t give me 15% off, no big I had a $10 off 50 coupon.  What was odd was they offered us 6.99 build a burgers.  It wasn&#39;t on the specials either.  Very confused but I asked what are they known for and the waitress said burgers and fish.  I decided to go with the burger since it was on sale. I got one medium w/ bacon, grilled onions, egg, and pepper jack cheese. I asked to sub grilled onions in for my tomato, but got charged 99 cents for it any how. I also got the pretzel roll and subbed waffle fries another 99 cents.  They really know how to add on little charges.  The bun was a lot harder and tougher to eat through than I expected, more like a french roll density and toughness.   The burger was cooked perfectly to medium. Though the fried egg was cooked through, I wish it was runny, they did not ask how I wanted it but I&#39;ve never been served a fully cooked egg before on a burger.

The appetizer tray was where it was at!  We got the 20 dollar sampler, at first I was like really 20 bucks?!  But it was well worth it.  They had some wings, corn fritters, fried mac and cheese, cheese sticks, fried green beans, and onion rings.  Everything was excellent, crispy and tasty!  The only thing was the onion rings, on their menu they say they are so good they can&#39;t say more about it (not sure exact wording) but basically they were just typical beer battered onion rings.  So not really special. But everything else was great.

The waffle fries I upgraded to were limp and not crispy nor seasoned.

Service was good.  Wish they would have dropped by a lot sooner after serving our food, I would have actually said something about my food not being that great.

Place is big and spacious, almost like there is not enough tables to fill the place.  TV&#39;s everywhere. wish they had closed captioning on it."

I was very pleased with the chicken wings and the sauce had good flavor. Today I had a burger and it was cooked just the way I ordered, it had good flavor and the bun was unique and delicious.

Here is what I would change:
The service was great on Friday night but today it sucked! Had to go in to get drink refills and the waitress was not very responsive. If not for the taste of the food I would have given them a 1-2 star review. The ranch dressing is home made but very runny. It tastes good but makes eating wings / salad a bigger mess than it needs to be. The last change I would make would be to put the nachos on a plate rather than in a bowl. You get the toppings all over the table and it just does not make you feel good about ordering them even though they are great. I am just worried this place won&#39;t last with bad service from some and I want to stress some of the wait staff."

We each had a burger and fries.  I had the bacon cheeseburger medium.  My wife had a burger medium well.  There was no difference in they way they were cooked.  Both were fairly dry.  Item number 1 that I have to call BS on is that they claim their burgers are fresh and never frozen.  We took a look at my wife&#39;s burger patty since she had nothing on it.  It looked and tasted exactly like frozen burgers at many different places.  Biting in to it you can see that it has a lot of filler in it too.  My second BS call is that their fries are &#39;fresh cut&#39;.  I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve gotten these same fries from the freezer section at Jewel!  Burger and fries were $9.99.

On the positive side, they do have a good beer selection, although it seems a bit pricey.  They server their draft beer in a narrow tall glass that makes it appear you are getting more than it looks like.  I&#39;m sure they aren&#39;t a full pint.  They may be 12 ounces.  For that it costs from $5 and up.

Finally, the wait staff.  They spent more time hiding in the back than they spent waiting on customers.  I met my wife there for lunch since she had to work.  It took 25 minutes to get the mac and cheese appetizers to the table.  They seemed to be frozen and just had to be dropped into the fryer.  Once my wife got there, I had to go hunt down our waitress so we could get our order in since she had to go back to work.  I mean my wife had to go back to work.  I&#39;m not sure what our waitress did, but it wasn&#39;t work!

All in all, it wasn&#39;t completely horrible, just bad.  If we go back, we&#39;ll sit at the bar and we won&#39;t eat there."

She is a regular here but this was my first time here. If you are a drinker the selection is pretty good but since I am not it is just another loud sports bar kind of place. Nothing in the place really sets it apart from any of the other places I have been to but there was nothing really wrong with it either.  The place is a little drafty and loud. Not much different than when it was 50 North a few years back.

Complete disconnect between the loud club music, laser light show, and fog machine.  The management needs to recognize their bar is set setup as a great place to watch a game, or have a beer and burger with your team after a late night hockey or softball game.   Their attempt to bring in a larger Bro crowd makes it unappealing despite the good food, good services and good beer.  Won&#39;t be back late night.  During the day perhaps."

I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, if a place wants to make money then it needs to earn it. My experience tonight was less than worthy. From me waiting a half hour for a burger. Then to wait another 10 minutes for silverware is ridiculous. And to the table that left a half hour ago that is still not clear. To the lack of a hostess on a Saturday night and the craziness that I have to ask for a menu.... to say that I&#39;m not impressed is an understatement. My server, a guy who I don&#39;t think said his name seems clearly not trained properly. 

Now
 to the food. I had the fireside ale house special burger or something like that. It&#39;s a decent sized burger I must say. But I asked for medium. It was borderline well. No juices left. But at least a decent portion. The ham on it was pointless because it gave no flavor. Could&#39;ve been the choice of ham.  And to the cooks, I&#39;m sorry but you just don&#39;t put the burger ON the lettuce and tomato.  The burger always goes on top of the bottom bun. Onto the bbq sauce. First bite I didn&#39;t taste it. Which was weird since there was about 3 times the amount I needed for this burger. But once I did, it was different and not something I&#39;ve had before. Very thin and vinegar-ish. Which was good. But it needs to be multiplied with the sauce. It wasn&#39;t powerful enough to compliment the burger but was good on its own. 

All in all I think this place has potential. Which I&#39;ve read on other reviews as well. So I&#39;ll come back. Not sure how soon. 


PS the food is missing the beer aspect. This place has &#34;ale&#34; in its name. Just a thought"

It had great service, some decent food, and always had the Hawks games. My last 3visits were less than satisfactory to say the least. Of the last 5 food items ordered 4 out of the 5 of the items ordered were wrong. The wait time for drinks was about 15 minutes with the floor at about 25% capacity. The waiter then went on how they were short staffed and he was the only one serving. He then spilled my drink on the table which spilled onto my lap. He also spilled my food order while serving it. The bartender did not know how to make a simple whiskey mixed drink. The service was bad and I didn&#39;t intend to write a review but I saw a group of ladies so upset about getting the wrong food order, waiting longer for their food than us and we were seated after them, and messed up their drink order and enraged the group so much that they asked for a manager due to the poor overall service. 

Oh, and the last time I visited after 11 there was a fight that broke out in the bar area. This place has declined significantly in a short amount of time."

Overall experience was good. We&#39;ve been twice, once on a Friday night, late January, once for lunch on a Saturday, February. Foods ordered: pulled pork sandwich, hamburger, pizza, fish and chips, buffalo chicken tenders, pretzel nuggets. All pretty good. Beer menu is fantastic. If you like micro brews, this place is for you. Nice to have a place close by where you can get something other than Miller, Bud, and Sam Adams on tap. Just remember craft beer costs more! 

Service was good both times. Kind of slow for dinner, but they had only been open for a month at that time. Staff was friendly, tables, benches, and bathrooms were clean. Lots of televisions above the bar. Two projection screens in the dinning area. Good place to watch sports. Loud on Friday night, quiet Saturday afternoon.

They need to get a menu on line and laminate the menus they have in the restaurant. We&#39;ll give them a chance, we like to support local business!"

Our quick dinner was not so quick. After getting seated, we waited 5-10 minutes before a server approached us. Upon coming to our table, he asked if anyone had been to our table yet, I replied no and he said he would be our server then. He took our drink order, we asked if there were specials, he said just the fish fry. On the drink menu one of the specialty drinks was an American Mule, but they were out of the Ginger Beer, essential in making any mule drink. We noticed a special sign at the hostess stand that said oysters were $1.50 each, when looking at the menu, we discovered that was regular price ($9 for 1/2 dozen), no &#34;special&#34; there. We waited another 15 minutes to get our drinks and order. I got the fish fry with the homemade potato chips and my husband ordered the Fireside Signature Burger, medium rare with the homemade potato chips. While we waited for our food, my husband reordered his drink, it never arrived. After 20 minutes waiting, he finally just went to the bar and got a beer. We waited a total of 45 minutes to get our food. My fish was good, but I received the steak fries instead of the chips and the tartar sauce was warm. My husbands burger was grey throughout (a far cry from medium rare) an the bun was rock hard, as if it sat under the heat lamp for quite some time. He also received steak fries, that were sitting a while too. The food had potential, but there was clearly a staffing and management problem. We were not told there were slow wait times for food until the server brought our food."

They did a great job with the renovations  which includes a nice big bar, huge dance floor w/ DJ, separate room with pool table/darts, and a private area for bottle service. The new place is beautiful!! We tried a couple of food items from their menu and everything was delish...loved the broccoli bites! Drinks were well made and delivered quickly by friendly and attentive bartenders. 

The best thing about Coach House is the friendliness of the entire staff...from the doormen to the bartenders. This is what sets them apart from other bars/clubs. Everyone is so welcoming and makes you feel at home! The owner, Jimmy, is always there to say hello. A special shout out to Tom, Nick, Tommy F., Meghan, and Monika.

Was here between 1am and 3am one night last week.  I was in a group of about 35 coworkers who were looking for a late-night bar to hang out in.  This one qualified, only because they were open until 4.

It seemed pretty crowded for a Thursday night.  Quite a few people were dancing, and probably the majority of them from our group.  Because we arrived around the same time (all in cabs) I am sure the regular patrons wondered where we were all coming from.  That&#39;s probably good, because I am sure we were all wondering where the locals were all coming from.  I guess this is a typical scene for this clientele, heavily tattooed, young, drunk and looking for either a one night stand or a fight.  Regardless, besides the few who were getting a rough handle from one of the bouncers, everyone seemed to be having a good time.

It was dark, and there was a bad smell that seemed to emanate from around where the front door was.  Also, everything just felt dirty.  I tried not to touch too much.  The $5 cover kind of surprised me, as the place was virtually a hole in the wall next to the highway.  Whatever.  I wasn&#39;t there to pickup chicks, but still had to pay. Ladies got in free.

We all made it back to our hotel alive that night, and even though I was not there to witness it, some of our group actually stayed until 4.  Of course, they had a tough time the next morning!
All in all, it is an OK place if you are looking to go somewhere after you have exhausted ALL of your other possibilities."

Bar and wait staff were friendly eager to please. 

Crowd was odd. Like, wear a flannel shirt, Ed Hardy or suit. Lots of very young looking people here.

The place is clean and the bouncers boot the riff raff. Tommy has been there forever and is a riot and Cammy is a truly delightful woman as well. (there are 4 or 5 other bartenders who also treat you right every...single time.)

They deserve props for the food and acceptable service tho. The bartenders are excellent performers when the mood strikes and their half pound burgers are great!

The late night crowd doesn&#39;t show till midnight or later, when decent bars kick the sloppy ones out. There&#39;s dancing, a DJ and a decent sized floor inside lined with large booths. Outside is nice too, with a covered bar and some tables to escape the blaring music.

The downfall of this place is the crowd. If you were wasted but energized enough to close down Coachhouse, you defiantly had an epic night and probably wouldn&#39;t mind the crowd anyway.

We grabbed a couple drinks here, as it was early, and there was no dance floor or DJ action at 11pm. Apparently they have a DJ quite frequently, and the place stays open till 3/4am according to the bartender.

Pros:

+ Very friendly bartender, she was quite willing to shoot the breeze with us
+ Stiff drinks, the Tequila Sunrise had some kick in it

Cons:

- The decor is fairly bland, an odd mix of dance floor club with more traditional bar area that is split in two sections, then a third which is further segregated from the first two, funky layout

Can&#39;t really comment on the dancing/music action, as we arrived too early. Overall, what we did experience, was okay, if nothing spectacular."

Spray tans required.

Drinks are kind of pricey and there is actually a cover at a suburban bar.

I&#39;ve had some pretty wild nights here myself..but I tend to steer clear of this place with all the riff raff that dwell here.

I mean, the music is good, the bartenders are all super nice and really take care of you, but they need to clean it ever 3 years or something..because I swear I saw a cockroach stand up on the bar and do the Walter Brennan dance..

ANYWAY! 

This place is actually pretty nice to come here in the summer they have this huge double door that they open up that leads to the deck on the side of the bar. Nice fresh air (depending on the amount of people smoking outside) blows throughout the place. They have a huge full bar outside and they usually set up Bags for people to play. The dance floor is inside the place but that never stopped us from making our own outside! 

The drinks are relatively cheap for being a nightclub, so that&#39;s always a plus. And I have to agree with Katrina, I wouldn&#39;t eat here if I were you..eat before you come if your that hungry! ENJOY! :)~"

The waitress finally came over and asked us what drinks we wantedak got all our orders but walked away before my other friends could order? Jersey shore scum and a mix or creepers and old guys and horrible waitresses... Never again

They have valet parking like they&#39;re trying to be upscale and also have a &#34;dress code&#34; that they randomly support. Despite the fact that my friends and I are clean cut well dressed citizens, we were denied because one of us was wearing a white shirt, yet they let other men go in with nearly the same clothes we were in.

Perhaps they just don&#39;t like guys that aren&#39;t yuppies or douches. or they didn&#39;t like the fact that I&#39;m a white guy with dreadlocks. If you want to go to a place that obviously picks it&#39;s patrons then go right ahead. The way i look at it is that i saved myself a hundred or two that i can spend at an establishment that values their customers, not shun them away because they prefer a relaxed look.

Maybe i&#39;ll go there in my  suit, see if they deny me then."

So my review is strictly based on countless drunken visits when all other bars are closed and Dakota&#39;s is too far.   I like the patio during the warm months.  The valet is nice, because the parking lot can be jammed.  Drinks are good, selection is decent.  The bathrooms are better now, don&#39;t make me elaborate on that, they&#39;re better now.  

I like getting there a smidge early to dominate the dance floor to some 80&#39;s hits before the DJ gets crazy.   It&#39;s nice to get out a little early too, because like Gramma always said: &#34;nothing good happens after 3&#34;  ha!"

This is one of those bars that stays open until 4am so its primarily an &#34;after the other bars that close at 2am close&#34;.  There is a good looking crowd with a mix of middle 20&#39;s up until the lower 40&#39;s.  There usually is a cover to enter (from what I can remember) that is roughly $5.

As soon as you walk in the front door there is a decent sized circular bar with a pretty big dance floor area in the back.  There is seating around the dance floor as well with booths and tables.  In the summer, the outdoor patio and bar are open often times with a guy grilling late night cheeseburgers (everyone loves a good cheeseburger at 3:30am).

Bartenders are pretty cool guys from what I can tell and the waitresses are walking around looking to assist in your boozing.  This is a pretty well run establishment and is a great place to head on a thursday through saturday night (or I should say early mornings)."

I can&#39;t even put a finger on what it tasted like, but it was aweful, and I was about to run to the bathroom to allow for it&#39;s exit.

The fresh cut fries were swimming in oil.  I also only ate half.  When the serverr asked how everything was, I told her.  I hate complaining in a restaurant.  When she came back she said that fresh cut fries tend to soak up oil more than other fries.  Yes, that&#39;s true when you don&#39;t let them drain from the fryer basket and instead drop them on the plate immediately after pulling them from the fryer. 

The server was nice and deleted the amount of the burger from the bill.  I said that I wasn&#39;t looking for that and that I should have said something immediately after taking the first bite.

The cold coffee drink I had was not as sweet as I expected.  It was very frothy.
Even though it wasn&#39;t sweet, it worked super well with my MC, seeing as I load that thing with 2 sources of sugar.  But, if you are expecting a sweet cold coffee, it aint it.

Daddy O&#39;s is a small diner on the main drag in fabulous downtown Itasca, IL.  The menu is typical diner fare.  I ordered a burger which came with soup and a side.  I ordered their beef barley soup.  For sides, one of the options was potato salad.  

The soup was actually pretty good.  While kind of skimpy on the ingredients (or generous on the broth?). it did taste good.  The burger was only fair.  I would categorize the beef as kind of bland.  But, the potato salad was very disappointing.  Rather than what I think I&#39;m used to, the potatoes were diced to about 1/4 inch or smaller squares.  The egg in the salad was very overcooked and it was way too much onion for my taste.

It is a nice family place - a real old hometown diner.  I&#39;ll be back and give it another chance at some time.  Perhaps it was a bad day for me, or for them.  I like supporting small family owned restaurants so I won&#39;t write this one off yet."

The staff is always so friendly and it&#39;s great to support local businesses.  Almost every time I&#39;ve gotten the Meat Lovers Skillet.  That comes with potatoes, 2(?) eggs your choice, and sausage ham and bacon, and your choice of cheese, as well as toast or pancakes.  I&#39;ve had something similar to this at other places and daddy o&#39;s does it best.  The meat is finely chopped enough so you don&#39;t have huge hunks in there like i&#39;ve experienced elsewhere.  Plus the food always leaves me full with plenty of leftovers to take home (and they taste good reheated!)  One day we decided to stop here for shakes and their ice cream was SO good.  I would come back here just for a shake sometime.  And can&#39;t forget the &#34;snow white&#34; - it&#39;s a sprite float.  yum."

It is off the beaten path but that is great because it was not crowded. Came here for lunch. Parking is in front.  It was smaller than I expected but that made it cozy.

Came with a friend. Had the gyros special. It was very good. Came with Tzatsiki sauce on side. Had fruit instead of fries. 

Our server, Emily was very friendly and accommodating. Very professional.  The hostess was also very nice as well

Overall the whole experience was enjoyable. I liked that it wasn&#39;t crowded. Most other places in area get very crowded on Sundays during breakfast and lunch and you feel like you are rushed to get in, eat and get out.. This was not the experience here.

Highly recommend."

Bright &amp; Clean little diner with super-friendly service.  Got a table right away and our order in a flash.  First time at a breakfast joint, so S.O.P - random omelet (south of the border), pancakes, greek toast.  The toast was buttered perfectly, the omelet was sizable and *filled*.  However, the pancakes are about as plain jane and uneventful as you can get- I think the issue is the batter is probably added to (ie blueberries, etc) for special order pancakes, but cooked as is when ordered as a side short stack.  Not bad, just OK.  Pleasant enviroment, and probably have to come back and try the diner fare in the future."

Maybe two servers is too few for the place, but our waitress seemed overworked and forgetful at best.

06/02/16 HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Per their menu, Thursday is $1.50 Taco Day for grilled steak and ground beef tacos. We called and placed our order for the $1.50 taco deal for pick up. We were not advised of the additional  .75¢ for lettuce and  .75¢ for tomatoes per taco, as the tacos only come with cilantro and cheese.  We were not advised that we had to say specially we wanted the $1.50 taco deal (which we did)...As there are 2  different taco sizes.  When we challenged the total, that is when we were advised of all of the extras, and that we did not specifically request the $1.50 tacos. BS!!!.

However, I&#39;ve never purchased a taco that did not have lettuce and tomato. And upon taking the order, you should have advised of the extra charge.

Waitress seemed like she was just going through the motions no smiles no interaction, maybe she was tired?

The main reason for leaving the review is I saw 3 tacos for five dollars. So I ordered three steak tacos. 
When they came I instantly noticed that the steak didn&#39;t even cover my tortilla top to bottom. Most, if not all places do this. To make matters worse one was significantly short as if the cook didn&#39;t gauge the portion correctly and just tossed what remained on from the first two on the last one.

Steak was good quality, however when you wrap about 2oz of steak with 2 tortillas. I expect to not struggle to taste the meat. 

Sure maybe I was jipped due to the lunch special

WRONG they charged normal price because the lunch special uses a &#34; different meat and different tortilla&#34;

So cheaper and bad quality ingredients, YIKES.

They have tons of vegetarian options and do them well.  Rare for Mexican restaurants.  Sometimes they overdo the lime in the guacamole but other than that, I have loved everything I&#39;ve ordered.  The service is always prompt which I appreciate since I&#39;m always working.  It&#39;s in a strip mall with a shared parking lot.  The only negative is the TV."

Although they were not really busy, sit-down service was slow. The lettuce in my taco salad was less-than-fresh and should have been tossed in the morning&#39;s food prep and replaced with fresh lettuce rather than try to stretch it out for one more day. And at 2pm, they were out of flan, which made me really sad.

Everything else was great... and in the last place I would think to look for a great dining experience - a strip mall. Definitely try the Mi Tierra tacos - steak, chorizo and cactus, and their Cubana torta - ham and pineapple.

I totally would give them another try and hope to up my rating then."

We used to get pizza here weekly.  Now it might be two or three months before we decide to give them another chance.  But the pizza I ordered yesterday was probably the last straw.  I picked it up when I was told and the pizza was cold.  I had to reheat it at home.  The crust wasn&#39;t extra thin and there very few mushrooms which was the only topping.

Something changed over the past few years and more noticeably the crust. Making it as thin as a few sheets of paper does nothing for this. There is nothing substantial to the crust that if you order more than a few toppings it winds up  being a mess. Order an XL and compare it to any other places large and you&#39;ll see that there is really no value. Paying $24 for one pizza and getting half of what the other local competitors give just doesn&#39;t cut it, no matter how good it tastes. For the same price Ill take Malnatis deep dish."

As there isn&#39;t a whole lot of whole choices in Hanover Park for delivery late at night, we ordered a couple of pies for delivery. Talk about a recommendation!

Pros:

+ The sausage and cheese were piled on thick
+ The thin crust was well-cooked and flaky 
+ The delivery driver arrived promptly and didn&#39;t have any issues finding our funky townhouse sub-division street
+ Rosati&#39;s sends out tons of coupons in the ValuPak and other mailers, plus there are more coupons on the menu&#39;s and even on the pizza box themselves
+ Collect enough pizza box tabs and you&#39;ll earn a free loyalty pie

Cons:

I can&#39;t think of any and I&#39;ve been ordering from them regularly for two years now.

Having only ordered pizzas, I can&#39;t comment on their other menu options, but for thin-crust, Rosati&#39;s is unquestionably one of the better choices in the NW Burbs. The cheese is layered on really thick, so eat it slowly and enjoy!"

Sweaty, filthy gloves are now going to touch my food. He picked up the soufflé and just drops it in the bag. I asked him &#34;um you don&#39;t put them in boxes anymore&#34; he&#39;s like &#34;oh you needed one&#34; I said &#34;not anymore&#34;. Hands me bag and I ask him, fork, napkins?

She had to reassemble it when she took it out of the bag. But the icing on the cake was my daughter&#39;s peanut butter sandwich. Which had.....maybe a teaspoon of peanut butter on it. It was essentially 2 pieces of white bread. 

Avoid this Panera at all costs."

The size of the restaurant is very big &amp; much bigger than it appears from the outside.  This Panera Bread is located right off of Biesterfield road &amp; is in the middle of a shopping plaza located next to Jewel.  

When I came in here I ordered a grilled cheese &amp; a soup.  The soup was absolutely terrible.  It had no flavor &amp; tasted like some one just microwaved week old soup.  I ask myself how a restaurant could mess up a grilled cheese but sure enough this restaurant managed too.  The grilled cheese was stiff &amp; overcooked &amp; it almost appeared as if there was no cheese on it.  

The staff here was good at keeping the place clean &amp; they seemed friendly but that was about the only positive of the place.  This last visit I had here will probably deter me from coming back here again.

Setting price aside (it&#39;s gotten ridiculous), the food was straight up not edible. I posted pictures on Facebook and received a ton of feedback (read: horror stories) and I became legitimately concerned about my children&#39;s food being dangerous for them. I threw my food directly in the garbage because my soup looked like a soup I&#39;ve left on low in my crock pot on day three because I&#39;ve simply forgotten it was there. I would never serve that to anyone let alone charge whatever you charged me for it. Even if I wanted to eat it, like perhaps if I was homeless and starving or some sort of prisoner of war and that&#39;s all that I was going to get, I still would have had a hard time eating it because the spoon they gave me had two different kinds of soup still on it. My son looked at his own soup and spoon with horror because he didn&#39;t visually inspect his before diving into the chicken noodle soup. Much like you guys, I love when people frighten my children when they try to make a healthy choice in a meal. Also, I&#39;m obsessed with clean silverware. In my home, I pretty much completely wash the dishes before I load them into the dishwasher. If I had a spoon that simply refused to come clean (like Eve in the Garden of Eden or a group of teenagers smoking a joint pointing fingers at each other as to who it belonged to) I would throw it in the garbage.

I&#39;m not even going to launch into the super brief experience I had with the staff. I should have used the Panera 2.0 crap you&#39;ve installed in this store, but, and I know this is crazy... I actually like interacting with people IRL still. I made the wrong choice, though.

Your corporate office responds with the worst, most cobbled together, psych 101 inspired drivel its offensive.  You guys need to either go full robot or get back to basics and actually care about what you do.  

Maybe reinstate the employee of the month thing since either no one has won since 2013 or you guys are just horrible at keeping your plaques updated.

The staff  here are, for the most part, friendly, though sometimes later in the afternoon I do get the feeling they are just about done with us customers (not that I blame them).  The dining area is comfortable and spacious (especially now that they&#39;ve expanded).  

The two things that are really stopping me from coming back, though, are product availability and price.  

It seems like every time I come in, they are out of at least one item I want: the candy cookies, a bacon souffle, etc. (They really struggle with keeping those souffles in stock, and 75% of the time I go in to get one they don&#39;t have it available and it will be a 20-30 minute wait for more - I&#39;ve just given up).  They also occasionally discontinue my favorite items, never to be seen again.  

Then there&#39;s the price.  Holy crap, this is getting bad!  They&#39;d discontinued my favorite flatbread so I went a different route and got a shrimp salad and a cup of soup.  Along with my small iced tea, this ran me $13!!! For a tiny salad and a cup of soup (I&#39;m not a large person and I was still hungry when I finished)!  I could&#39;ve gone to an ACTUAL restaurant for that price.  
Their food really isn&#39;t worth the cost.  It&#39;s glorified fast food.  The soup is obvious made from a mix, and their breakfast sandwiches are greasy and taste a couple days old (the breakfast sandwiches cost more than Starbucks&#39; and aren&#39;t as good).  The salads aren&#39;t bad, but I can get better at Portillos.  

The only thing that is really worth the trip is the souffles, but they only serve them in the morning and most of the time when I&#39;m there, they&#39;ve run out."

This location tends to get super crowded during the 12-1 lunch hour so I try to go at the tail end of noon or right before noon. If you do happen to get here during the peak time it is good to know that the lines do run fairly quick.

I always get the &#34;pick 2&#34; combo with broccoli cheddar soup and BBQ chopped chicken salad. My biggest complaint is that the to-go salad portion is MUCH smaller than the dine-in portion. Also, I always feel the need to ask for extra dressing as what they drizzle on the salad as well as the extra portion they give isn&#39;t enough. I tend to have a heavy hand with dressing. 

One of the last times I was here I ordered my usual and while I was waiting for my food I noticed that my receipt showed a totally different salad. I went up to the cashier who took my order and told her there was a mistake. She went to the kitchen area and loudly stated that &#34;the customer changed her mind&#34;. Uh, no...don&#39;t make me look flaky. I didn&#39;t change my mind, you rang up my order wrong. Other than that one snafu, I haven&#39;t had any other issues with this location. A co-worker of mine goes here and she frequently mentions how they mess up her to-go order. I haven&#39;t had that happen to me, thank goodness.

Also, sign up for the Panera rewards club...as though you need one more key tag on your key chain.

Oh, and if you order a drink, you have the option of adding on a dessert for just 99cents! Who doesn&#39;t love a 99 cent dessert?"
panera-bread-elk-grove-village,Elizabeth W.,lTvtN6Ype23fHMzIc8bb8w,"Des Plaines, IL",0,1,1,279,88,c5RFB7qqtoGeugiw9IDHeA,2.0,2011-06-30,"I&#39;ve been to a number of Panera locations--Printer&#39;s Row, Crystal Lake, Des Plaines, Arlington Heights, you name it. This is my least favorite so far. Everything tastes the same as at any other location--it&#39;s the matter of getting your item/s and paying for them that&#39;s a problem.

In the past year, I notice that all of the Paneras I visit are making smaller batches to avoid wasting/not selling food. I&#39;m ok with being told, &#34;We don&#39;t have any french baguettes right now, but we&#39;re taking some out of the oven in about 5 minutes if you&#39;d like to wait.&#34; What I truly dislike is coming in here at 3 in the afternoon and finding that not only are they out of most types of bagel, all types of baguette, sourdough bread bowls, and small loaves of country bread, but they aren&#39;t baking any more, either. What about all the people who come in on their way home from work  around 5:30 to grab some bread for dinner? I guess they can just walk over to the Jewel in the same strip mall to get it, unless they actually wanted a sourdough bread bowl, something Jewel and Dominick&#39;s don&#39;t carry.

I&#39;ve popped in here a handful of times to grab stuff on my way home from Alexian Brothers, and every time they were out of something. The last time, it was dark roast coffee. There was no ETA on when they were going to brew more, and my husband was very tired from getting up early to take care of me, then not eating lunch because he wanted to stay nearby in case there was a complication during my procedure at Alexian. He settled for some lukewarm light roast coffee. Despite there being a large sign that says they always have fresh-brewed coffee, and despite every other Panera location I visit putting little tags on the coffee pots that states the time they were brewed, this location can&#39;t even promise their coffee will be hot.

Finally, the service is far below that of other Panera locations. On one occasion, I was in here just for a french baguette, which I grabbed from the kiosk near the entrance. I didn&#39;t need an employee for anything except to ring me up and take my cash. I had to wait over ten minutes when there was not even a line because the only employee on the registers was chatting about her college plans with what appeared to be one of her mother&#39;s friends. I tried waving at her a couple times, but she didn&#39;t react. Other employees walked past and one even made eye contact with me, but nobody asked if I needed help or offered to ring up my order. There&#39;s no reason why I should have to wait that long to pay for one item in a fully-staffed shop with only two other customers in it. On another occasion, employees walked past a spill on the floor again and again without cleaning it. Again, fully staffed shop; almost nobody in the place. Why can the crazy-busy Panera at Printer&#39;s Row manage to stay clean and keep up with things, but this much slower location cannot?"

I ordered an Asiago roast beef sandwich to go with chips.
Drove all the way back to work, opened the bag and unwrapped the sandwich.

did you know that when you order an Asiago Roast Beef sandwich...you have to STRESS you want the meat?? 

Yes folks.....opened sandwich and no beef

Wheres the beef!!

I drove back there, asked for the manager. pimpled faced 18 yr old tells me he is &#34;one of them&#34;. I asked him to open the bag and tell me which sandwich this is that they have on the menu.

Needless to say, he was speachless and asked me &#34;what kind of sandwich would you like it to be&#34;

I said a free one...WITH MEAT!

The ambiance of the restaurant is exactly what I would expect from a gem on the outskirts of streamwood. The would be a decent place to bring a small family but, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for a large gathering.

The food was beyond expectations and I could not be happier with my discovery. Everywhere I have lived I have searched long and hard for that go to Mexican spot that offered flavorful tacos with the authentic taste.

The tripa tacos were cooked to perfection with the right amount of crunch and without a trace of burnt flavor. The chicharron tacos melted in your mouth due the right ratio of skin and fat. It still offered a bit of crunch and tenderness like it was hand picked from the pig. The lengua taco was exceptionally delicious due to the fact that they not only have the right combination of fat and meat but, their process of cooking the lengua reminded me of shredded pork pulled from a pig roast. 

I would highly recommend this place especially if you&#39;re into authentic Mexican food and I will definitely frequent this establishment more often."

This is a waaay casual spot and the dining room isn&#39;t what I would call &#34;appealing&#34;. The kitchen appears well maintained and I feel completely comfortable ordering food from here. 

My husband and I both much appreciate and quite enjoy how generous they are with their portions. Three taco dinner each taco jam packed with chicken, steak, pork, beef, you name it! They will allow you to select a different protein for each of the three tacos. We typically order double rice with no beans but I would say I do like the beans better than the rice. Sadly, I do not care for beans all that much. The rice is simply put, just fine.. It&#39;s not the best but it&#39;s fine. The tortillas are fresh and the meat is tender. 

We pay about the same for 2 three taco dinners as we do for two meals at Chipotle which is not intended to compare the food but simply the pricing. 

The quality of the rice and the interior of the restaurant is where they lose the fifth star from me. We will continue to order from here and support our local businesses!!"

Maybe it&#39;s the boxes of unpacked bottles of beer stacked in front of the counter... or the collections of bottle caps underneath a bottle opener stuck to the wall... or it could be the jukebox that just so happens to play after you make your order... or that super smiley guy behind the register that waits patiently as you try to decide between tacos al pastor or lengua (tongue), then decide to get both. 

Whatever it is - it works. Adorable little place with phenomal tacos al pastor - very flavorful and a niiice helping of meat. I think we got one of each on the menu. Carnitas was good too - had a good crunch to it. Tasted a lot like Filipino lechon. Yummm.

Very salty steak tacos and burritos....with fat bits mixed in with meat.  Also too greasy for my wife.  Chicken tacos looked and tasted like it was processed. Lettuce, tomato and shredded cheese were the only toppings.  Was expecting cilantro and onions.  Lettuce and tomatoes were not fresh. Refried beans and rice were average.  Chips were greasy, but salsa was decent.

Our family was hungry, so we ordered takeout.  I should have order just a few tacos to sample before going all in.  Ended up eating half of what we purchased and instead had leftovers from night before to complete our dinner.

But my recent favorite is the Tripa, fried crispy unlike some other places.  Not too greasy and packed with flavor.

Cheese Quesadillas, woah are they addictive!  The tortilla is hot, crispy, and packed with delicious ooey gooey Mexican cheese.  I don&#39;t even bother adding any meat, it&#39;s just cheese perfection.

The three taco meal is a great deal. Steak, chicken, beef tongue, and ground beef are all excellent. The tamales are also memorable and served in the corn husk.

It&#39;s my go-to for inexpensive, quality Mexican food.  It doesn&#39;t hurt that I can practically see it from my front door!!

I have been here many times since we moved to the area a few years ago.  I have had the steak tacos, the steak burritos, some tortas, and the quesadillas as my go-to meals.  My favorite out of those are the quesadillas.  They are NOT good for you whatsoever, however, they are a really delicious comfort food.  This is the kind of authenticity that has the delicious grease at the bottom of your to-go container and I  don&#39;t even CARE because it&#39;s so delicious!!

Trust me, one bite and you won&#39;t care either.  This is not your Taco Bell, my friends!

The sides that come with many meals are good, too!  They don&#39;t skimp.  The atmosphere feels authentic (including the Mexican soaps on their little TV when you dine in).  They are fast, they are friendly, and they are quality."

Other than the name, El Rodeo holds no ties or themes regarding the famous Southwestern sporting event of the same name. Sorry rodeo fans.

People at work swear by El Rodeo, and now I know why. I enjoy a good taco, and this place has some of the best. In fact, my whole experience was really very nice, and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone looking for a great hole-in-the-wall taco establishment.

The service I had was upbeat and friendly, and my food came up pretty fast. While I was waiting, I gave the chips and salsa a try- absolutely fantastic. I suspect that it contained black beans because there was a little smokiness to it. I enjoy smokiness in my stuff. It&#39;s a flavor I think I&#39;d like to experience in more salsas. Also, the salsa is spicy, another thing that I really like.

Make no mistake, this is not a pretty place to eat, and they sometimes play their jukebox kind of loud. But if you go there, at those times just take a minute to remind yourself where you are: El Rodeo. Yee-ha. Eat them tacos."

El Rodeo is your basic taco joint that doesn&#39;t deliver as far as the normal menu items but there are some surprises hidden in the menu.

 All of the tacos iv&#39;e had from there tend to be dry and on the small side. The carne asada, carnitas, al pastor, and chorizo were just average - nice seasoning but both times just overcooked. Same thing with the burritos - just a ton of overcooked gritty meat. I mean they have a chance as long as they don&#39;t kill the meat more than it already is.

So the diamonds in the rough are the tortas and the hard shell tacos. Yah I know its weird but the breaded steak (milanese) torta is a perfect combo of tender steak, creamy guac, and a nice soft roll. On the other hand the hard shell tacos (my mom wanted to try them) remind me a little of those crappy BK or Jack-In-The-Box tacos but 10x better. Fresh and crispy tacos that more than make up for the filling being a little bit dry.

Short but sweet - skip the regular tacos and go for the hard shell and skip the burrito and go for the torta. You will thank me later."

I always get the tacos and they are always delightful. I request flour tortillas instead of corn.. lovely that they have that option! Recently I tried the chile relleno and i was blown away. SO good. 

I&#39;m also quite fond of the nice man who runs the place and the jukebox that randomly plays popular songs in Spanish.
When I say &#34;popular,&#34; think &#34;titanic theme song&#34; and by &#34;play&#34; i mean you have to stop your conversation until the song is over. Totally fun, right?

Not only do we eat there we also do carry out. Not to long ago we dined in and I ordered the chicken flautas which are usually very yummy. The chicken inside the rolled and fried tortillas was burnt. I didn&#39;t say anything because we are &#34;regulars&#34; and chalked it up to just one of those things...The next time we go my husband orders beef tacos and the ground beef is burnt. Ok he should have said something and had them make him another order but he is not a complainer and like me just chalked it up to one of those things...

Last week my husband came home with chicken tacos for me and beef for him. Mine was okay but again BOTH of his tacos were filled with ground beef that was hard as a rock because it probably had been sitting on the grill for too long and BURNT. Plus, the taco shells are a lot smaller then what they used to be. LOL! the price went up, burnt food and the taco shells got smaller. I mean I seriously wondered where they could have gotten shells that small.

It is located around the corner from my place... and on those lazy cooking days, guess where we go/pick up from! 
At first, all I ever ordered was the Al Pastor tacos... they are so delicious. Juicy, saucy, flavorful pork, tucked into a warm corn tortilla, and topped with some chopped onion and cilantro. Two of those babies, a medium orchata, and I&#39;m good to go! 
The hubby has tried a few menu items, from tacos to their carne asada platter, to the lomo. I gotta say, the lomo dish is delicious. The sauce it comes in is almost a mole, but lighter. 
All of these orders were delicious, substantial and satisfying. Until we tried the carne asada gordita. 
We get it with avo, splash some salsa verde on it...  and it is pure flavorful deliciousness. 
(I was recently in NYC and tried Caracas arepas... I wanted to love them, I really did.... but this hole-in-the-wall taco joint near my house has gorditas that are a homerun!)

One of the waiters saw us first and seated us at a table.

For drinks, they had a big wine list and a bar with different alcohol choices. They don&#39;t have any draft beer but do have a good selection of bottled beer.

We had Rigatoni Rustica and my wife had a gluten-free seafood pasta. The food was excellent and my pasta was cooked perfectly - al dente.

The service was so-so but that looks like it depends on if you are a regular or not. It seemed like the staff seemed to be very attentive to a couple tables and it sounded like they were all friends. We weren&#39;t regulars and while we weren&#39;t abandoned, we weren&#39;t looked after like the regulars.

Its on lake street in a ho hum strip mall in basement, but their attitude anything but ho hum basement cum stripmall cum lake street. We were told to take &#34;Reservations&#34; when we walked in since in basement, smelled overwhelmingly fishy. We were seated in the middle of room in the path of going coming waiters who often bumped into me,spilled whatever I was eating, drinking, half of dining area by windows empty until we finished eating. They insisted we order appetizers, when I refused the waiter rolled his eyes. Forced to order 4 entrees for 3, clearly says so many dollars worth of food. My entrée eggpla
nt parmigiano was definitely frozen heated in microwave. In my rating not worth even one star. Ambiance, service,taste a big Zero."

But we were the only ones when we dined for lunch. The food was OK. To be honest I can get better from other restaurants I more often frequent. Service was adequate. But what bothered me most was the flies. We switched tables once...maybe twice. But the moment food is served they want over. I found it hard to enjoy when that was happening.

Enough in fact for 2 lunches. All the pasta and risotto was great.  Good wine list and friendly service.  Chocolate mouse pie and flourless lava cake was to die for.  Service was a little lackluster but friendly.  They also have live entertainment on Friday nights that you will enjoy if you are over 50."

I had the lasagna and to me it was too runny and not much flavor, very plain.  Appetizers were semi warm and not much flavor, you can tell they were not fresh but frozen.  The bread that was brought to the table was excellent.  The service was friendly overall, however server spent a lot of time talking and kissing inbound customers that didn&#39;t belong to his service area.  Confused by other servers bringing food?  I was asked only once if my cocktail needed to be refilled, over an hour being there.  Finally, atmosphere seemed to be geared to an older crowd of 60+...  I will not be returning!!!!"

The food was good - our table had a variety of pasta, seafood and chicken dishes.  The lasagna was a big hit as well as the linguini frutti de mare.   The desserts were also delicious - spumoni, cannoli and a wild berry tart with ice cream (my favorite of the three).

We really came to this restaurant for the show but were very pleased with the meal and the service.

A couple girlfriends and I met here on a Monday night for some yummy drinks and Italian food.  We got nothing less than the best--the best service, amazing food, and a really fun and funny environment.

The service was spot on.  We had people checking in on us constantly but without being intrusive.  They were making sure we had everything we needed and that everything that we ordered was good.  And trust me, it was.

We were one of two tables in there when we first walked in around dinnertime on this particular Monday.  It surprised me that they weren&#39;t more busy, but it WAS one of the Hawks playoff game.  I&#39;m sure not many people thought to themselves &#34;Where would be a great place to watch the game--A fancy Italian joint!!&#34;.  It wasn&#39;t bad news for us, because the service was amazing :)

We weren&#39;t quite sure what to order for drinks at first.  Well, my cohorts didn&#39;t--It was Tequila Monday for me, so I got a margarita no salt--make no mistake.  This was one of the BEST margaritas I&#39;ve ever had!  My friends got the house pinot and prosecco.  Very good as well, but my drink was very strong but very smooth--definitely a hit at the table!

We ordered the calamari (fried) as an appetizer.  It was AMAZING.  They even serve it onto plates for you.  I am serious, the service here was top notch!  For our meals, my one friend ordered the lobster ravioli, I had the Rigatoni, and our other friend had a really fresh-tasting pasta dish with a lot of vegetables (not sure what it was called, but it was yummy!)

My rigatoni was AMAZING!!  It was just the right balance of sauce and noodles as well as some of the best tasting crumbled italian sausage I have ever had!  The dish was HUGE, too.  The other meals were good, but I loved the sauce on my dish as well as the freshness of the pasta.

We each had a dessert--because why wouldn&#39;t we?!  All of them come on a long plate and the presentation is beautiful.  Furthermore, the taste is amazing--which is kinda the best part.

The only downside is the price, but I guess that&#39;s what you pay for amazing food!  I will definitely be back again and again!!  My friends are in 100% agreement!"

They took 20 minutes to bring out a dessert plate (restaurant was empty). The lava cake they brought out came out to be $7.57. There was so little on the plate it was worth no more than two dollars.

The Good-  
1)  The pre-meal mangia.  It&#39;s good.  It&#39;s plentiful.  It&#39;s different.  Yes, you get the whole bread with oil thing, BUT you also get some parmesan without asking.  (Thank you!)  AND you get a small olive plate and some delicious red dipping sauce as well.  YUM.  
2)  The marinara is delicious.  And I am a HUGE marinara snob.  So there&#39;s that.
3)  The eggplant parmesan was awesome.  The only thing I would ask for next time is more marinara.  (See also:  reason #2)
4)  Service is pretty good and everyone in the restaurant seems to help each other out.  I like that.  
5)  They have a decent wine list including some local wine too.  Lynfred, HOLLA!!

The Bad-
1)  The place is really small and almost feels like you&#39;re interrupting a family meal if you aren&#39;t a regular there.  I guess I just need to come more often?
2)  The service is definitely different for regulars.  I get that.  Really, I do.  But if you&#39;re going to start passing out Italian Ice, or Limoncello, or Gelato...pass some over here too, man.
3)  The minestrone was meh.  Not BAD, necessarily, but just ok.  

The Ugly-
1)  There really is no UGLY, I guess.  I just feel like you can&#39;t do a good and bad without an ugly too."

Their entrees come with a daily soup or salad and both are great. The first time, I had the Capellini Fra&#39;Diavola and the second, the Linguine Campagnola. Both were incredible- really fresh and so delicious. During our second visit, we also had their tiramisu and creme brulee- so good!

I can&#39;t remember much about their wine list, but we enjoyed the wine we had both times. Service is a little inconsistent, especially when they get busy, but their food is definitely worth a visit!"

1. They got new more stylish menu&#39;s with a few small menu/price changes. 

2. They changed some some staff...I think. 

As to the menu, they now offer a free soup or salad included with the split charge which I think is a pleasant surprise. I&#39;m usually never a fan of split charges because its like charging you extra to dump the food on 2 plates instead of one. The fact that you&#39;re getting something makes this way better. 

Now every time I&#39;ve come here so far, something went wrong with the service. This time it was SPOT ON PERFECT! Thanks to an attentive young waitress named Melissa who provided quick and efficient service.  

Food was still good and the free focaccia  was still warm and fantastic.

We started off with that bread basket, full of pizza bread among other options and it reminded me of the pizza from  the Italian deli that my mom served as an appetizer every christmas! Then there was bruchetta, a light and refreshing salad, to be followed by an awesome vodka sauced pasta. At this point, I should have headed to my car and changed into buffet pants but I didn&#39;t.

Momma mia!

I came to Villaggio on Valentine&#39;s Day for its romantic ambience.

For beginners, they served both focaccia and Italian bread alongside olives, red sauce, and olive oil.

The lentil soup was tasty but over cooked. The garlic salad dressing totally missed the mark.

Before our main meal, they served lemon Italian ice which I thought was a nice touch.

I ordered zuppa de pesce which I must say was absolutely perfect. My wife couldn&#39;t keep her fork off of it.

After dinner, they served, on the house, small biscotti cookies.  

The place was clean. Servers were polite and very professionally dressed.

I really enjoyed our visit here.

About a solid 2.9 

Food
- bruschetta was really delicious! Very Fresh and the brad was crunchy buy not break your teeth hard.
-salad..yeah it was a salad
-pasta was good. The sauce was kind of runny and there was like 2 cups of sauce to 1/2 cup of past but it tasted ok 
-I don&#39;t eat meat so the chicken parm. smelled chemically-but the potatoes and broccoli were delicious. 


The atmosphere.

-weird plastic burgundy chairs...come on ...I have had better atmosphere in a banquet hall. 

Would I come back a huge maybe....maybe if I ate at the restaurant maybe it would have been better but as a group meal with a pre fixe menu...not really that great.

It was a disappointment. On a Friday night, there were only ten tables, yet service was terrible. The servers were scatter brained and running around. We started out with one waiter and ended with another. It took someone 7 minutes to greet us and ask us if we wanted anything to drink besides water. After that, another 20 minutes before we had our order taken, and then half hour for our food to arrive. 
The food was mediocre. Bread at the beginning of the meal was good as was the palate cleanser. My husband ordered the fettuccini alfredo which was bland and dry. I ordered the gnocchi which was chewy with a bland tomato sauce. 
We will not be returning."

The restaurant is in the basement of a strip mall badly in need of remodeling.

That said, the actual inside of the restaurant is quite welcoming and cozy.  The bar area is really small, but in a good way because it makes the place feel warm and friendly.  My wife and I went on a Friday night at about 7:30 and the place was quite busy, but we were sat fairly quickly.

We both orders pasta dishes and thought they were excellent.  I got the &#34;Mama Mia&#34; which is just bucacelli, sausage, meatball and brociole... wonderful to the last drop!

The service was great and service always means a lot to me.  We ordered the bow-tie pasta with salmon and the pork tenderloin.  Each meal came with salad or soup and intermezzo.  We also got fresh bread with a choice of dipping sauce and olive oil and cheese.  The food was great and the portions were large so we have leftovers.  We definitely want to come back more often.

Something about the decor made it very cool and inviting. The staff though felt somewhat distant.

I ordered the Lobster Ravioli from their Lunch Specials Menu.

They brought out bread first, two types: white and something with tomatoes and basil and other seasonings. Along with the bread there was a bowl of Parmesan cheese, containers of butter, a plate of black olives, and a tomato-ish spread... not sure what it was called but it was good.
I also chose the salad with their house dressing. Also delicious.

The Lobster Ravioli was awesome. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the filling was just the right amount, and the sauce was one of the best I&#39;ve had. There was also crab legs and shrimp piled in the center of the plate. It made me happy.

I&#39;d definitely come here again, probably with some friends for a nice dinner. I definitely got more of a fine dining vibe than a casual lunch. Luckily I was dressed up."

Never went there before and we&#39;ll be back. I agree with Debbie on 2 things - they do ask if everything is okay a little too much and the salad was drenched in balsamic vinegar. The bread was fantastic and the sun dried tomato paste that comes with the bread was really good. I had the clay pot fruti de mare and it was the best I&#39;ve had.

We were pleasantly surprised by Villagio.  The service was very good and we got a quiet table in the back.  We ordered the sausage in a clay pot for our appetizer and it was delicious.  My husband had a veal and pasta dish and I had the risotto with seafood (not great) but my husband&#39;s plate was amazing.  We were fighting over leftovers the next day.  Will come back here again.

Anyways, I crashed a company party which obviously wasn&#39;t one I worked for so I nibbled a bit and drank a lot.  22oz Korean beer and Soju is always a must at these places so, well I partook.  Service seemed decent at best, giving we were in a large private room with about 40 people, eating and drinking, I guess it&#39;s not too bad.  

Karaoke? Yes please.  It would&#39;ve been awkward if I had sang here knowing only a handful of people I had to resist.  System is a good one and speakers are loud but definitely a drunken type of karaoke here.

When we went in there it was dead we were the only ones there. Had to wake up a guy snoring in the back. When we ordered was told what I ordered couldn&#39;t be made because the owner does the cooking and he/she went out shopping. We were mislead to get the bulgogi that was 24$ that was a one person serving. I thought it was a two person dish but it definitely was not. We were going to do the regular one but the server said it was watery and probably not the one we wanted. So one tofu soup and one of that became over $40, way tooo pricey.

Haven&#39;t had good experiences here in the past but we decided to give it another shot because the owners changed.

We all ordered from the courses menu.

The food was good.... kinda sweet for my taste. Not sure if they used a lot of sugar or corn syrup or something... but portions were pretty small for 4 people. Also they forgot to give us one of the courses, but later on they made up for it by bringing us a little something extra :) we got, pumpkin porridge, dumplings, japchae, pancake, salad, sashimi salad, sashimi &amp; shrimp, bibimbap, bulgogi, &amp; fruit. My favorite was actually the pancake. So good!

I liked that the walls had writing all over them. It was fun writing my own thing on it and searching for names I might possibly know.

The new owners are super friendly. One of them stayed and chatted with us at our table for a while. She told us the name of the restaurant would be changing too!

Idk if I&#39;d get the courses again, but I do want to go back and try the rest of their menu!"

It bears resemblance to the Korean  (bars), which aren&#39;t the most family-friendly places.

The food was okay! I enjoyed my ooguhjee tang (). It had some large pieces of beef in there, and the broth was rich, savory, and salty (I like salty). 
The other members of my company ordered naengmyung, donkatsu, and albab. 
The albab was my favorite because it tasted like a quirky version of bibimbap. The sweetness of the caviar and the crunchiness of the dried pieces of rices at the bottom of the hot bowl were pleasant surprises to my tastebuds. 
The donkatsu on the other hand was a bit too soggy and bready. 
I didn&#39;t get to try the naengmyung, but the friend who ate it said it was refreshing to the tastebuds and the soul.
The presentation of the foods are also quite nice. The naengmyung came out in a lovely large ceramic bowl, and the donkatsu was arranged with various fruits. 


For the food I would come back again- I hope to try the rest of the things on the menu! A good place to try for variety!"

Then again, I heard it&#39;s more popular with those who want to drink and eat on the side later at night, which makes sense because you would have to be REALLY plastered in order to think this garbage is good at all. My unfortunate experience featured the seafood noodles, which was basically colored water with pepper and MSG. It was thin, bland and spicy without any actual flavor beyond the heat of it... and I don&#39;t know what they use to make the Korean pancakes with, but they are as tasteless, crumbly and........ nope.

It&#39;s one of my favorite foods in the world and I usually buy it from the market to make &amp; eat at home. A couple weeks ago I went for some singing &amp; drinks with my BFF and with a little buzz going on we had an extreme craving for Korean goodness.

When we walked in, there were tables but it wasn&#39;t overly packed for a Saturday night. Waitresses walked by us standing there and took them a few minutes to acknowledge our presence and they said it would just be a moment. We waited some more and they finally came back and pointed us to a table we should sit at.

We ordered our food, had good service, had a lovely time. Their starting items were very tasty and I enjoyed them. The bulgoki was good and had no issues with it at all. It runs $13 at Dae Jung Kum. As we ate, 80s music videos played on huge tv screens in the restaurant which was odd but added to the fun of the night.

I had high expectations because the place was bumpin&#39;. You could hear the base from the Korean pop music from outside. Sadly, everything went downhill after we were seated.

I was shocked that the stoves were broken and instead, portable stove tops were used instead. There were only two servers so service was very slow. Our waiter forgot to put in my order so I watched as everyone else ate their meal. By mid dinner, they had run out of kalbi and white rice. 

Despite everything else going wrong, I finally understood why this place was so popular. The food itself tasted good surprisingly. The kalbi was well marinated from the little that I had and the spicy Korean miso soup (daen chang jjigeh) was very flavorful. 

Note to non-Koreans: your server may speak some English, you must call out in order to get service, and anything served in a stone pot will be extremely hot."

THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. They literally ignored us from the time we walked in (we were never even greeted), to the time we walked out.

If we asked for them to replenish one of the side dishes, they ignored us. They literally threw the food on the table when they brought it to us.

It wasn&#39;t even busy.

My coworker and I stopped in for lunch and were pleasantly surprised to find it under new ownership.  We&#39;re Chinese and Japanese, so we&#39;re not snobs of Korean food, but we definitely dig this place.   First off - check out the appetizer that looks like an omelet.  They stuff squid, shrimp, and a ton of fresh veggies inside and serve it with a spicy (garlic, chili, etc.) &#34;potsticker&#34; sauce of sorts.  Awesome.

The panjan (side dishes) were all excellent, especially the kimchee.  I ordered the mackerel, expecting to get a sauteed mackerel with rice, but they hooked me up with the whole fish (I&#39;m a huge fan of fish served bone-in, head, and tail, as it seems fresher in my mind, although this didn&#39;t have a head or tail).  My friend, who&#39;s crazy for bimbibap, loved his dish and commented on how jealous his wife would be that we found the place.  We&#39;ll definitely be back for lunch and with significant others.

What other restaurant slices their meats and cheeses and bakes their bread fresh on its premises daily? Thereby, they taste best from all the rest!

The staff are always friendly, courteous and responsive. As far as fast food goes, these people are quick to prepare and expedite orders. 

I also noticed that most of the employess are male. In the city, these guys ride their bicycles to avoid city street congestion to get to an address in a remarkably timely manner. (Maybe this has something to do with it.)"

I give address for delivery, I get a call saying I&#39;m not answering the door when I was on the couch right next to my door. They said that they knocked on our door about 40 times. Person drove up and I was waiting. Went outside and the person was knocking on our neighbors garage..

No problem, as I&#39;ll be sure to update this review often until they come upon it...

My husband and I kept getting Pop&#39;s menus and coupons in the mail (and we drove by it often) so we headed there for dinner one night. To our surprise, Pop&#39;s is more than just a sports bar -- there is a small restaurant dining room off to the side. Both are easily accessible from either side of the building.

We were seating at a quiet booth in the restaurant and promptly handed menus and a giant bowl of the most delicious bread I&#39;ve ever had prior to a meal in a restaurant. It was SO GOOD. I nearly ate the whole loaf. For dinner, my husband ordered a rotisserie chicken while I had the fish (I believe it might have been the Friday night fish fry). Both meals were the perfect portion: not too large, but still left you stuffed after finishing off the entire plate. Both meals were also very delicious -- surpsingly so, considering this was just the little dine-in restaurant attached to a bar. Our bill wasn&#39;t too bad either. We left satsified. Our meal wasn&#39;t the best meal we&#39;ve ever had, but it was good and memorable enough to put this on Yelp. Whee!"

Was a Saturday around noon. Five other people there and they all had their food when I showed up. Ordered a turkey club sandwich and got it 30 minutes later. Let that sink in for a moment. Toasted bread with turkey, mayo, lettuce and tomato took 30 minutes with nobody else ordering food. The bartender even went back several times to check on my food.

Okay, every place deserves a second chance right? Went again tonight and it was busier but not packed. Got my food in about 20 minutes this time but my server spent most of the time sitting at a table with two other servers and a couple of guys. Another server brought out my food to her to bring to me because apparently checking on your customer&#39;s order isn&#39;t something they do on their own? I ended up asking yet another server to get my check and she was the one that rang it up too because mine wasn&#39;t around. 

I heard two servers complain to customers about how slow it was and how they weren&#39;t making any tips. I empathize with that but complaining about it on the floor to customers is not exactly creating a great customer experience.

On the plus side the place is nice and clean and plenty of screens for sports. The food wasn&#39;t bad either but based on the indifferent and apathetic service I think this is my last time there. There are plenty of other bars with big screens and food."

The menu is HUGE: the pizza is great, the apps cover all the bases (fried mac and cheese bites are AMAZING), the wings are huge, and everything else is worth a shot. I&#39;m a picky eater, but I always have a hard choice. 

There are only two things that keep me from giving a 5-star rating - firstly, it can be a little pricey. I would get a drink with my dinner if the check for two people wouldn&#39;t end up near $50 afterward. Secondly, they aren&#39;t great with staffing the bar area. The bar isn&#39;t huge, but on more than one occasion, we&#39;ve had painfully slow service because the poor bartender was by herself, serving the entire bar AND making service drinks for the waitresses.

And this is another reason that I love Yelp!  I went to Pop&#39;s when I was much younger and I&#39;ll always have those memories. And then I visited about three years ago. I didn&#39;t love it. Back a year later. It&#39;s okay. I head back last year for a party and I can see improvement. I Yelp all about it and now over another year later, I&#39;ve decided to give them one more star. 

I still don&#39;t adore Pop&#39;s, but as an official Blackhawks bar with good pizza, decent service and a great location, it works. I&#39;ve tried the wings and like those too. The service gets better with each passing visit so that&#39;s a plus in my book. Our friends love Pop&#39;s so I imagine that we&#39;ll be visiting again soon. And when I do, I&#39;ll enjoy the game with our pizza and wings and I won&#39;t feel bad about supporting this local business.

I frequent Teddy&#39;s Diner for lunch, and after one visit, I would guess they are both on par with each other. The main difference I could see right away was Pop&#39;s was neater and larger.

I will try it again and update my review once I have a few visits under my belt."

I ended up cleaning off my own table. Getting my own plates and napkins silverware etc..  At the end of the night the manger refuses to pay the entertainers on a 4 hour show????   With over 75 people who all ate you claim wasnt good enough will never eat or refer anyone to their establishment.  People save your money and spend it else where.

Obviously the place was packed but hey, it&#39;s a sports bar on game night..they should be packed right? Right away i noticed an attitude with our waiter. She barely came to our table, maybe once every 40 mins or so, she would only stay for seconds at a time. I was with a group of 10 people, there was no way we could all order what we wanted in a couple of seconds, but she would just walk away! Wouldn&#39;t even bother asking if anyone needed anything. She didn&#39;t get us water, or napkins, or ketchup for our fries. She had a nasty attitude the entire time, anyway we asked for the bill which she screwed up, took her 30 mins to get us the correct bill (with attitude) and then we waited, and waited, aaaaaaand waited. 45 mins later, she STILL hadn&#39;t picked up the bill. That was the last straw, I finally complained to the manager who was really nice and covered the whole thing for us. I appreciate him taking care of us like that but the service was so awful that I really don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever go back to this place. If you&#39;re a sports bar and that&#39;s how you operate on game night...maybe stop calling yourself a &#34;sports bar?&#34; 

Also side note, I ordered the &#34;boneless wings&#34; aka chicken tenders - WORST chicken tenders I&#39;ve ever had. EVER. Barely any breading, just tasted like boiled chicken with minimum sauce/seasoning. Absolutely gross..couldn&#39;t even finish them. How does a bar mess up chicken tenders? it&#39;s just breaded chicken deep fried!! 

Avoid this place, head over to Westview instead..they got their stuff together over there!"

Pro tip: Do not order too much food at the beginning of your visit because Pop&#39;s lays out a one pass buffet during halftime. The servers will not tell you about this because it is obviously to their gratuity disadvantage.  If you take advantage of the buffet, please be sure to tip your server accordingly because not only do they lose the opportunity for table turnover during the duration of a game but they lose out on potential tips earned from food that would normally be ordered.

The bar area provides many seating option that range from open hightop areas, table seating, bar seating, and a strange and awkward perimeter seating situated around the table area. I saw awkward because you&#39;ll be directly on top of the table inside the ring staring at their heads, food, and drinks in very close proximity.  All of the seats have at least decent views to the banks of flat screen monitors tuned to various sports channels just in case you don&#39;t care for football.

The thin crust pizza is standard thin crust style found in many bars so it&#39;s good but nothing to specifically make a trip to Pop&#39;s for. I suggest 2 toppings at the most as the pizza flavor becomes convoluted otherwise. 

The nachos were of the standard bar variety as well and featured nothing special and came out in the standard heaping typical mess. Satisfying but nothing unique.

We were going to order wings but after seeing someone else&#39;s order containing average sized wings but pricing, in some cases depending on quantity, at or over a dollar per wing. Whaaaaaat? No, thank you.

So why four stars? Only because it really is one of the greatest places to catch the Bears game in the area. Bucket deals for domestics are cheap as well so you won&#39;t have to worry about breaking the bank to come out and watch a game. Make sure you arrive early for decent seating so you won&#39;t get stuck with an awkward aerial view of the person inside of the awkward ring."

They are the friendliest most outgoing tenders I know. They move constantly to keep the place clean, servers supplied, and visitors happy.

Its an all in one. Want to go on a nice date night with your sweetie.. you head into the dinning room area. Looking for a fun night of drinks and YUMMY food go stright into the sports bar. Or heck do both. The best part is even if you go into the bar you can still get the full menu, which might I add is AMAZING! Its higher end food at low end cost so really how can you go wrong?!?!? They have some of the best wings and ranch (made fresh on site!!). But what keeps me coming back is the Chicken Scampi. I know it sounds crazy a bar that serves pasta dishes, but 95% I HAVE to get it! 

The staff is very friendly and its fast service even when its busy. The bar is also an offical Blackhawk&#39;s bar. So you know the game is always going to be on (as well as any other ones) And they usually have some fun raffles going on through out the night.

I recently moved very close to Pop&#39;s and thought it was going to be a great bar to live near.  In a way I was right but mostly wrong.

The pro&#39;s....

Pop&#39;s does have great drink and food specials for each day of the week which is nice if you are looking to drink and eat for cheaper than most places.  They do have outside seating with TV&#39;s in the window if a game is on, which is always a plus.  


The con&#39;s....

For the most part the servers seem to be very nice but at times seem miserable.  I mean I understand it&#39;s work and no one wants to work but it gives off a bad vibe.  I was also somewhat under the impression that it would be more crowded on weekends.  For the weekends that I have gone it has been pretty slow.  I know it is called Pop&#39;s pizza but I am going to be honest when I say their pizza is pretty bland and nothing to brag about.  



Overall, I give it two stars because I feel there is a lot of areas that they could improve upon.  I do however appreciate the drink deals."

There are still a handful of good servers, but more likely than not, you will get a server that has no clue what they are doing.  Take last Sunday for example: we sat down with 6 people for the Bears games.  A server came by about 10min after we sat down, we ordered a Bloody Mary from the Bloody Mary bar (which was not stocked), a couple of waters, and bucket of beer.  The Bloody Mary pint glass showed up with vodka and melted down ice because it had been sitting for pick up for so long, no waters, no beers.  After waiting and waiting and waiting, we decided to go to the bar to get our own drinks.  She came by 45 min later, didn&#39;t even realize she forgot the other things ordered.  This went on for the entire game.  We even had to bus our own tables.  When I looked for some &#39;in charge&#39;, they were MIA.

It&#39;s a pizza and sports bar as their name states...nothing more, nothing less. 

I&#39;ve opted to eat in both the bar and restaurant area. Either way, the food is the same. Some days are better than others, but either way it&#39;s average bar food. I&#39;ve tried a little bit of everything...pizza, appetizers, salads, sammies, pasta, and wraps. There&#39;s usually decent daily specials, that&#39;s a bonus. 

Service is always friendly and typically fairly fast. Prices are fair and portions are pretty large. 

As for the atmosphere, this is not a place I would come to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night. As is, the bar area usually brings in some of the local drunks, which I prefer to not be around. If that&#39;s what it&#39;s like during the week,  I&#39;d hate to see it during amateur hours...

The restaurant is where I prefer to eat if I&#39;m grabbing a quick bite with a friend. It&#39;s much more quiet and the service is better. I feel a little less dive-y in that section. Other than that, I stick to carryout. 

Pop&#39;s isn&#39;t bad if you&#39;re looking for a sandwich, some fried bar food or greasy pizza. You won&#39;t find me hanging in the bar, or slamming back beers on Fri//Sat night, but that&#39;s just my preference..."

They&#39;ve done some cosmetic surgery a few times over the years, but it still doesn&#39;t hide the overall nastiness of this place. It&#39;s in serious need of a real good top to bottom cleaning. 

The service is beyond horrible. If they get your order correct,(They&#39;ve gotten it wrong more than once) it  takes a long time to get it, and it&#39;s average at best. (The pizza is probably their best item, but with all the pizzerias in the area, why bother?) I could walk to this place in 5 minutes and still rarely go, that should tell you something. It&#39;s not that I hate the place, but when I go out I want to lean on a table I don&#39;t stick to, use a bathroom I&#39;m not disgusted by and get a feeling that they actually spend time behind a mop &amp; bucket.

The ambiance is fun and they play great music at night. The video screens are big and when it&#39;s not &#39;sports time&#39; they play music videos. The food is actually pretty good if you eat it at the bar. I have ordered delivery from them and it&#39;s usually a hit or a miss. I have been inconvenienced with incorrect orders but the manager was accommodating. This makes all the difference and is the reason why I continue to support them. Mistakes happen and when a business owns up and corrects the mistake, they are regarded as great in my book. People are all quick to judge places based on one mistake but I give credit where it is due since the manager wasn&#39;t resistant, cheap, or in denial of my concern."

I&#39;ve tried so many different items that I can say you won&#39;t be disappointed with anything there.  The portion sizes are large, and the food is great the next day as left overs.  You should try the chicken parm, the Philly chicken sandwich, and their wraps.  

Their service could be better, but I always take my food to go anyways.  Definitely recommend the food, but I haven&#39;t tried the pizza yet."

Poor seating placement by the walkway. We have never had a friendly or even non-rude server at this place. They complain about being in their &#34;weigh&#34; and that&#39;s not a misspelling if you know what i mean.

Dave and his staff did a great job from planning the menu through the entire event.  The staff were really awesome and helped me to set up the room (without being asked!).  It was a huge help.  

The food was great - we had grilled shrimp, filet and meatball appetizers, a family-style dinner with chicken, beef and veggies, and of course an open bar.  There was plenty of room for the DJ and dancing, and we had our own restrooms.  Everything was clean and organized.  Our staff had a great time, and the entire event was surprisingly affordable!

As an official Hawks bar they do it right , great sound , plenty of tv&#39;s , good food , good service . So we decided to go last night to see the Hawks play the Sharks a 9:30 game . Sat down ordered our drinks a diet coke for my wife and a iced tea for myself and nachos . Then they started to change all the big screens to fighting as well as the sound , I stopped the fellow who was changing the tv&#39;s about the Hawks game , he said that there would be no sound and games were on smaller tv&#39;s . I asked about the Official Blackhawks bar credo stating all tv&#39;s and sound tuned to Hawks game , he indicated that it was not his call . There were no signs on the doors telling us that the game would not be on , heck my wife had herJersey on you would think the waitress would tell us , nope ! Needless to say we paid for our drinks and cancelled our nachos and left , found another Hawks bar that followed the rules , Pops you lost a good customer! ! !"

When I picked up the food two immature young girls were not professional at all.  Loud giggly and even made fun of a customer that called (after they hung up).  A young guy came out and chatted with the two girls and loudly dropped the F-bomb twice right in front of me and laughing regarding an order.  Now I don&#39;t mind swearing but swearing in front of customers and acting like I wasn&#39;t there while they acted like kids was just wrong.  If I was the owner I would be super pissed hearing and seeing what I did.

The bar area/bar side of the establishment is pretty spacious - not just a large bar but many booths &amp; tables.  On 3 occassions (typically after work - say, 5pm), there was just one person serving the entire place.  

&#34;Running around like a chicken with her head cut off&#34;.. yep, that describes it perfectly.

The typical wait for a drink refill - even just some water - was probably 20 minutes - if you could flag her down.  And this is while sitting right at the bar.

The food is hit/miss.  Our wings were dry as a bone.  The &#34;fish fry&#34; was just a small plate of ok food.  The mini burgers are typically the safest bet &amp; the fries were good as well.  I had a chicken wrap that was pretty decent.

Basically, this used to be the only place to go close to home, but now that Bulldog has opened, we go there instead.  

I did enjoy the laid back atmosphere at Pop&#39;s, the friendly bartenders - when they were around - and the little patio is nice too.  But the bad service now keeps us away."

I haven&#39;t been very impressed.  The first time I had the Philly steak sandwich.  While it was plentiful, it wasn&#39;t particularly flavorful - spices?  None.  I mean bland.  Now, I&#39;m from Philly, so maybe I&#39;m a tough audience, but if you&#39;re going to make it, then let&#39;s make it right!  The Bartender was reasonably attentive, which was good.

The next time I had a pizza.  It was fair.  The oven must have been having problems or something because the dough was overdone on the outer bottom of the pie, but underdone in the center.  There was also some carbon on the bottom.  I&#39;d have sent it back, but it took so long to get in the first place...  The Bartender on this occassion, was awful.  While I&#39;ve never cooked, I have tended bar and this guy was busy in the back, busy chatting up other customers and we had to flag him every time we wanted a refill or the check.

Overall, there&#39;s a lot of room for improvement."

It was just okay for me; it wasn&#39;t great nor awful, Coach&#39;s Corner is another bar &amp; grill that blends into a suburban strip mall.

There is a lot of seating, and the service was good. I felt welcome and comfortable. I tried the cheese sticks, which so many people raved about, but I was disappointed. The mozzarella cheese rolled into a tortilla and deep fried is bland. My friend&#39;s cheese curds were a lot better.

I also tried the pizza, the &#34;Sicilian style&#34; which comes in two sizes.  The smaller can easily feed 2 or 3 people, so I brought a lot of leftovers home.  The doughy, thick crust was good - but the cheese and sauce were bland.

Just okay.  Not a bad spot to watch a game and have some beers.  Food isn&#39;t terrible, a good place for picky eaters or the budget-conscious.  It beats going to a local chain outpost."

The servers are all outgoing and kind; they check on you often to make sure you have everything you need.  The atmosphere and drinks are great.  I would&#39;ve given it a four star review if the food was a little better.  The wings are very good, but outside of that I am not overly impressed with the food.  The wraps are decent - but a little dry.  The salads seem like they used bagged lettuce.  And the pizza - which I want so badly to be good - tastes a little off.  The crust is excellent as is the cheese to topping ratio but there&#39;s something about the sauce that I don&#39;t like.  It has a sweet and overly acidic taste to me.

The infamous cheese sticks were good but to me are more taquitos instead of real breaded cheese sticks which I was expecting I guess. 
My jr. Cheesy beef was ok,
(Portillos is still my top), but they messed up my order and added hot peppers which ended up burning my mouth so I couldn&#39;t really taste much. 
Fries were standard. I didn&#39;t want to give my beef back bc we had waited SO LONG for our food.
I don&#39;t know maybe I&#39;ll come back when it&#39;s not so busy and give them another try. But last night was def nothing memorable in my book."

Poor service. 

The Bloody Mary was nothing like the pic advertised it was half the size and came with 2 olives and a dried up lime. 

The 1/2 pound boneless chicken wings were small and dry, the fries were nothing special. I&#39;m pretty sure I have had more chicken nuggets in a happy meal before.

For the price and portions I won&#39;t be back."

The first thing I noticed was it was not very busy at all for a Saturday night, and a Cubs game on. Odd? We chose a table and a server came after a little while of sitting. They don&#39;t have a spectacular beer menu, but something for everyone. The minute I looked at the menu I was overwhelmed. It is so hard to read with all different colors and crap everywhere...why can&#39;t we just keep it simple? It looked outdated.

Our server changed, and we ordered the Hawaiian pizza and the cheese curds. The food is your regular bar food, nothing over the top or new. The pizza was actually really good. But the service became more and more shotty as the servers started to care more about watching the game than doing their job. We never got a water (or any other drink) refill. At the end of the night it was good pizza, but kind of expensive for the service we got. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be rushing back."

This not your corporate &#34;Sports Bar&#34; that is over running Wrigleyville that has no character and just looking to make a buck. 

When I go to a sports bar I want sports wherever I look. Here they&#39;re on the TVs and the memorabilia is unique and everywhere! They always have THE game on and there is always a crowd for the Chicago games. Maybe I think the reserved tables for the games is annoying but at the same time, there is a demand which means you know the place will be packed and give you that atmosphere you want for the game. (I saw the Blackhawks clinch the 2015 Stanley Cup here and it was my first Cup outside of living in the city and it was a good substitute! They had sirens and horns....everything you&#39;d want!)

You may...no, you will be overwhelmed by the menu! It&#39;s very loud, very busy and all over the place. In the end, they really have it all here. 
I really like the Cheese Sticks, they are just simple and unique and I recommend them. Now to be clear, this is not a Mozzarella Stick!!!! If you think that you&#39;ll be disappointed but it&#39;s just a tortilla with cheese in the middle rolled up....just order 2 if you&#39;re worried but you won&#39;t regret it!  

The pizza isn&#39;t too bad and I think the Italian Beef is up there and will not disappoint! This is all bar food and bar food done well. 

In the end of the day, if you are in Elk Grove and want to watch the Bulls/ &#39;Hawks / Bears/ Cubs....this is the place that I would pick for the energy and to go to have fun!"

She walked past our table 9 times before I finally got up, walked to the bar and ordered my friend a water and a beer for myself. She saw the guy bring it to us. Never apologized or anything !!

You come in and they look completely disgusted that you want to be here.  They ask you how many are in your party and tell you where you can sit.

Once you are seated they present with a menu that resembles a comic book.  There is so much going on with this menu it can be daunting to take in all at once.  It is known that the more menu items a place has the lesser the quality of the overall dining experience.  You can&#39;t say this more for Coach&#39;s.  They have sandwiches, pasta, soups and salad, burgers, chicken, pizza.  You name it they have it.  I&#39;ve had everything from the Italian beef, to the chicken, to the wraps.  Nothing is impressive.  Perhaps this is a place where the level of your satisfaction of the food and service increases as your sobriety decreases.  Unfortunately I only come here for lunch during work hours so I wouldn&#39;t know if that is true or not.  

During and after your meal the workers here, who are the same every time, will service you with disinterest.  They can be smug which is an attitude I never understood when you are in the service business.

The atmosphere, besides the moody waitstaff, is like any typical neighborhood bar.  They have plenty of televisions with all kinds of sports programming on.  

The only reason you should come here is if you want a less than average experience."

Coach&#39;s Corner is your typical sports bar, located in Elk Grove Village. Convenient to my office, I went with a group of co-workers and thought this could be a regular on the lunch circuit. But, that was not meant to be.

First, I have to say the server was very nice. She was pleasant, cheerful, clearly liked her job, and attentive to our needs. Service was fast. They are &#34;famous&#34; for their Italian Beef, so I gave it a try. They price things separately, so I knew when I ordered I was ordering the sandwich, and the fries and cole slaw were extra. I also ordered an Iced Tea with lemon.

First things first, the Iced Tea was served in a tall glass with two fresh lemon slices. I&#39;m not sure how they make their iced tea, but it tasted like it was powdere and not fresh. Strike one. The food was served on a tray with a large plate. The Italian Beef looked good. The fries were a little skimpy - there didn&#39;t seem to be as many as would have been served elsewhere. In fairness to Coach&#39;s Corner, they were very good. The Italian Beef had a good taste, but it was dry and there was not as much meat as there should have been. 

Where I lost is was when we got the check. As noted earlier, I knew we were paying extra for the fries, but I did not know we were charged separately for hot peppers (giardiniera), which is typically served along with Italian Beef. The Iced Tea (price not shown on the menu) and sodas others ordered were also pretty expensive relative to other local restaurants."

I have been going here for years and recommend it to those who come into town. The server was the only above average thing about the business left (jc). We ordered fried pickles and a large pizza so we could take some home for my mother and I. When our pizza came; I laughed and said this is barely a medium and not a large. So the manager comes out with pans and says it&#39;s a large on a medium tray but hanging over. It was 2 inches of bread. The pizza wasn&#39;t even good as it was skimpy. It was quite obvious that they are cutting corners. They charged us for the large and acted like we were visually impaired. Perhaps that is why the place was half empty on a Saturday night.

To start with, It&#39;s a Half empty restaurant and they sit us in the highest traffic spot in the place. Busboys, waitresses and patrons bumping in the back of my chair the entire experience. This was the start of worse things to come. 

The waitress was not around to deliver our food, so some busboy did....
The food was over cooked across the board including the $10. Order of chicken wings that were completely burnt black on one side. (which were all turned down of course).  

Our Waitress ran by asking how everything was prior to flipping over the chicken wings. 

The next time I saw her I let her know about the burnt wings and she said there&#39;s nothing she could do now... I should have let her know sooner. 

I left the food, tipped the waitress and learned a lesson. 

Coaches corner is a generic sports bar, with no heart or soul.... just terrible food and overpriced drinks. 

I will drive the extra mile to Pops on Nerge or wait until Pope&#39;s Pizza Opens back up on Devon.

Game had tipped off, and they didn&#39;t have the Bulls on a single TV. Instead they had ESPNU, NHL Network, ESPN Classic, etc with nothing relevant on.

The pub burger is very good and the Italian Beef is almost as good as Portillo&#39;s but what really tops the chart is their thin crust pizza.  If you are a thin crust aficionado, you have to try this but be sure to eat in and get it hot out of the oven.  Even leftover slices are pretty darn good if reheated in a toaster oven.
I don&#39;t understand the haters.  As I said, I&#39;ve never had a bad experience. 
Coach&#39;s Corner has daily food and drink specials that provide good value.

Nice bonus was the trivia night. Not often you learn so much trivia at a bar you can trust is true. Of course Ted was in his usually entertaining form and made for a great guest bartender. My only gripe is no fresh brewed tea. I&#39;m not a drinker and the stuff that comes out of the gun isn&#39;t my favorite.

I decided to kill time at Coach&#39;s Corner one day when it was snowing.  (Of course it has to snow during the hours of 3pm and 5pm.  Why can&#39;t Mother Nature hold off a few hours?!)  BEST decision of my life.  Where else can you get cheap mai-tai&#39;s, hurricanes AND cherries dipped in Bacardi 151?  ALL right here.  

Their food menu is just amazing.  It&#39;s all the typical bar stuff, but just tons to choose from.  (There&#39;s everything from wraps to salads, to ribs to pizza to cookies!)  Apparently, they&#39;re known for their &#39;cheesesticks&#39;, but they aren&#39;t the typical breaded and deep fried mozz sticks.  It&#39;s cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla and fried.  Delish!  Their Wednesday night special was 2 sliders + fries for $6  and you could choose from chicken, meatball, cheeseburger, beef or sausage.  I got the chicken (lightly breaded + buffalo sauce) and the sausage and it was seriously the best bar food I&#39;ve ever had.  

If you want to watch a sports game, THIS is the place to do it at.  There are a million tv&#39;s, so you could probably catch two games at once.  The bartenders have always been extremely friendly, so I&#39;m so thankful to have discovered this great spot!"

You have to start with at least a couple of cheese sticks.  Yesterday, I had the southwest chicken salad and really enjoyed it.  My friend had the bleu cheese burger and was disappointed - either the cheese melted or they put a little bleu cheese dressing on it in lieu of the cheese.  It was totally absorbed into the burger or the bun; not what she expected, but she asked for onion, and doctored it up so that it was a satisfactory burger.  On previous visits, I&#39;ve had the patty melt and other friends raved about the beef sandwich.  Living just a couple of blocks away, it&#39;s my go-to spot when whoever I&#39;m with doesn&#39;t know what they want; there is a wide selection with specials.  

It can be noisy, so don&#39;t go there if you are expecting a place to have a quiet conversation.  I was there during a Hawks game and every time the Hawks scored a goal, the foghorn blared and the entire place erupted into a chorus of Chelsea Dagger.

Solid bar food, casual atmosphere, good value.  Service can be a little iffy, depending on how crowded it is."

Coach&#39;s Corner was hosting a Hawks Roadwatch party. We arrived almost an hour and a half early and found out most tables already had been reserved but obviously the tables were empty, alot of them had not arrived yet. Okay so we will wait for one of the few that weren&#39;t. Then we were told they had given away all the wristbands, but there were not that many people there yet and I was told go count if I didn&#39;t believe her. I believe ones were put aside for the reservation people though they were not there yet. We left and did not spend our money there.

I was in charge of reserving a table for our group the week before...but of course I forgot, so I called the day of the game to reserve a table for 8, and we were a go!!!  Got an awesome table right in the middle of the restaurant too!!! 

Lots of tv&#39;s and plenty of seating.  It was pretty crowded in there.  It seems like a neighborhood bar, and just about everyone knew eachother!  I ordered the Crispy Chicken Salad with the mild sauce on the chicken...very yummy!  The hubby ordered the Cheesy Beef...Im not a big beef eater, but even I enjoyed it!!  Everyone else in our group enjoyed their food as well!  The prices are great in my opinion! You can&#39;t beat a $7.49 salad!!!  They also have great drink and food specials through out the week.

FYI:  4 star rating based on the fact that I know what is good/great there (see below.)

Italian Beef:  Awesome!   And it always has been (15 years ago I had my first one!)  I enjoy the cheesy beef, with sweet (and sometimes hot) peppers...it comes on a Turano roll...perfect for soaking up the delicious drippings.  Paired with their fries and slaw at lunch, it will set you up for a very comfortable afternoon nap!  Warning...you will need extra napkins.

Other things like the Burgers, Cod Platter, &amp; BBQ sandwiches are just fine.

I&#39;d stay away from the mozzarella sticks &amp; the pasta dishes...not really the place for those things.

As a family of 6, everyone can find something to eat, and if you have boys (we have 3) in the family, the abundance of sporting channels is quite overwhelming...which is kind of nice if you want to keep them occupied while you are eating!

So, for what it is, it is, and it does a good job of doing it.  4 star for me, and pass me another napkin."

Based on the reviews, it looks like this place has gone downhill. I used to go with friends when their parents wanted to watch some sports game. They had these amazing fried cheese rolls -- not mozzarella sticks, but some doughy, rolled up cheese things served with marinara sauce... Whatever they were, they were heavenly.

The only real downside I have with the bar is that the way it&#39;s set up, it&#39;s not really well set up for bigger groups of people.  They have a few spaces for bigger groups, but for the most part, it&#39;s tough for a group of 8 or more to find a spot for everyone to sit comfortably.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a great bar/restaurant!"

When I don&#39;t have the pleasure of sitting at the bar (it&#39;s a tad small but good size for the place it&#39;s in) i always request Megan as my server. Not only is she super fun but she never gets our picky pizza order wrong and she doesn&#39;t even write it down!!!

I&#39;ve tried a lot of the food here and everything I try is always good. It&#39;s hard for me to look at bad reviews about food in a bar because the point of most bar food is for it to come out fast and hot. I&#39;d say coaches corner goes above and beyond fast and hot. Their pizza is delicious, the sandwiches are all tasty, those mozzarella sticks are something pretty special and the prices are fabulous. If you&#39;re looking for a nice steak tartar maybe try a fine dining French restaurant at $90 a plate.

All in all this is a great bar with a neighborhood feel, a supreme staff, tasty tasty food and a lot of entertainment. It&#39;s worth a try of you havn&#39;t been!

The food is consistently unimpressive.  My least favorite being two of the burgers.  The bacon and Merkts cheese one and the super cheesy one also with merkts.  Now a burger with merkts is one of my favorite foods of all time.  But somehow these guys completely overwhelm the sandwich with the amount they put on there.  Sure generous portions are great but not to the point where it destroys the whole point of why the sandwich is good.  They need new cooks.  The fries even suck.  The popcorn chicken is alright.  Pizza is alright.  Moz stick things they have are alright.  Drink specials are nothing real special.  My friend always gets the buffalo chicken wrap and its usually decent.  She has gotten the soup several times (french onion) and it has been both decent and inedible in different visits.

We have also been really impressed with the food.  We have seen our fair share of sports bars, and we have yet to be disappointed with anything we have eaten at Coach&#39;s.  

Yes, it&#39;s a sports bar in the suburbs.  Yes, it&#39;s in a strip mall.  HOWEVER, they&#39;re doing things right at Coach&#39;s.  You can tell it&#39;s owned by people who really care about their business and their customers."

Is that because it&#39;s the only sit-down restaurant that serves Chicago-style food? Maybe because it&#39;s the only &#34;kid-friendly&#34; bar (wow, now there&#39;s an oxymoron) where the closet alcoholics in town can get a beer and halfway-decent food in &#34;downtown&#34; Elk Grove while their kids are preoccupied with TV or video games (why&#39;d you ever leave the house?). 

Where to begin? For one, smoking was allowed here before the state ban. Problem is, post-ban, it still REEKS. Could someone change the ceiling tiles out and CLEAN the place so it&#39;s not so disgusting? 

Cleaning is, apparently, not a great priority for this restaurant. After all, how could I forget the cockroach struggling to escape from my glass of root beer? They sure do love this restaurant! 

If that statement doesn&#39;t have you running for the bathroom--or the exit--wait&#39;ll you try the food! Bust out the Imodium and Tums! The Italian beef sandwich is way too spicy and messy. The pizzas take a while to cook and aren&#39;t worth the wait. Everything else is just your classic greasy, overpriced, over-seasoned bar food. 

Unless I&#39;m watching a game with friends or enjoying the drink specials, I wouldn&#39;t waste my time or money here. The service is only so-so, it just depends on your waiter/waitress. Maybe &#39;da Coach&#39; should spend some time training the wait staff. But, again, being a bar...maybe you should expect a few to be downright rude to you? 

I imagine that with their new location, Big Sammy&#39;s must be making a killing. You want a taste of some real food? Chuck your vomit bag and walk a few doors down. Big Sammy&#39;s has the real Chicago-style goods."

Nothing fantastic.  If we didn&#39;t have a family member in ICU at alexian bros, there&#39;s no way we would go here in the first place.  We figured we would try it since we&#39;ve gotten sick of panera and McDonald&#39;s.  
We had &#34;home made mozzarella sticks&#34; which supposedly were rated by Chicago&#39;s best ... These were the most edible out of everything that we ordered.  It was cheese rolled in tortilla and deep fried. Sammys in the same strip mall has a very similar thing, and they are BETTER there. 
We also had three sliders, a regular hamburger, a salad and boneless wings.  The sliders burger meat smelled and tasted spoiled.  the boneless wings were clearly taken out of a box and plastic bag and tossed in the deep fryer and then coated with hot sauce.  If you like mediocre, and your starving, they work.  The salad was 8 or 9 bucks and had nothing special or unique to it.  The hamburger was over cooked and probably frozen as well.   we finished our meal with a cookie pizza thing that was raw cookie dough in a deep dish pizza pan.  the edges weren&#39;t even cooked.  however, it was the most edible thing that was put on our table.  
If you LOVE country music (that seems to be the music genre that plays  a song ratio of 1-2) and don&#39;t mind getting bubble gut before you leave the table, followed up by explosive diarrhea (seriously- i got sick) ... eat there.

The staff is pretty good at taking care of you and making sure everything is OK.  The service has improved over the years.  Its a regular place for lunch for me since its so close to work.

It actually hurts,  They need to turn it down a little, you actually would be able to hear it better.  Keep it as loud as you want in the Bar area.  I have asked a couple times nicely to turn it down just a tad so you could talk without yelling, that fell on deaf ears.  I&#39;m a hockey fan and this high volume is a bit much on the table side when trying to talk at all.  Cannot enjoy the food.
Turn it down a tad Coach!"

Our server was very polite, friendly and just fantastic.  We started with a couple appetizers (cheese sticks and soft pretzels).  Cheese sticks o.k., but not really what we expected.  Pretzels we&#39;re soggy, but in a good way - and they were really good.  Good selection of alcoholic beverages.  We had fish, burger, and beef.  The food was excellent!  Definitely not what we expected from &#34;bar&#34; food.  We also tried the mini desserts and they were very good.

They have a wide menu of you typical bar food site down dinning and let me say this place gets packed for lunch and dinners, expect to wait in the summer for a place to sit when basketball, baseball, soccer, football or any sport is going on. They usaully have super bowl partys were limited tickets are sold which is going on now .... and unlimited BEER and finger food are given throughout the game and plenty of raffels also going on for the event.
 Prices are reasonable and one signature item I always get here is the &#34;PIZZOOKIE&#34; Yep thats right a little 6 inch pizza pan with a 1/2 backed chocolate chip cookie doe topped with 3 scoops of vinalla ice cream melting away on the hot cookie &#34;MMMMMM&#34; its sooo good I promise you!!!
I love the southwest  pizza here too.  Chicken, bacon, onion, with bbq sauce instead of tomato sauce .MY FAVORITE!!!!!! 
The bar tenders are pretty cool here to Mike usaully will take care of you after a couple rounds.

The wings were fatty and clearly frozen.  The burger was charred and well done, even though I asked for medium.  The salads were expensive and just terrible.  The lettuce was still wet, everything seemed either frozen or canned, and the dressings had strange tastes to them.  We had a few sliders as an app and they were horrible.  They were overcooked and tasteless.  We also had their &#34;famous cheesesticks.&#34;  It would have been nice to know that they were not what you would expect.  They were cheese rolled in tortillas and fried.  I read menus closely and somehow missed this.  We were terribly displeased with the food and pricing for frozen reheated bar food.  The service was quite weak.  Our server didn&#39;t know much, and kept responding, &#34;I&#39;ve never tried that.&#34;  It is just a bar, not a place to eat, in my opinion.  I am not a food snob if the price is right, but at those prices, they don&#39;t deserve to stay open.

The place was pretty busy, which was a good indicator (well at first it was haha). There were two people waiting to be seated before us and right after we got inside , a few others walked in. Sadly, the hostess let everyone sit before us. We had to wait 10 minutes because there were no tables open.  I told her sweetly that we got here first and she apoligized for not noticing... Apparently us being in front of everyone didn&#39;t matter.

The waitress seemed better at first. We ordered beer (which BTW they had pretty decent drink specials), and waffle fries with bacon and cheese and italian beef sandwiches. The waitress looked straight in my face and asked if I want fries with it. I started laughing and said... I think I will stick with the waffle fries... enough starch for one night. She didn&#39;t get it and proceed to ask my friend if she wanted fries with the sandwich. Whatever.
As soon as we got our food, we realized we didn&#39;t receive any silverware or napkins. I was really tempted just to eat with my hands and make a mess..but then i stopped myself and took some silverware from the table next to us. 
So when our beer glasses were half full, or half empty (whichever you prefer), she stopped by asking if we need more drinks. We said we werent ready yet. She just walked away. BUT when we were done with our drinks, she would pass by our booth without asking us for anything. My friend stopped her, asking for another beer and she walked away saying she will be back.... 40 minutes later we asked for check... I am NOT going to wait an hr for another beer!
She came by with our check, we decided to split in in the middle by using two cards (i am not sure if that was just too complicated for her...). She gave us our receipts back and I started laughing... Isnt half off of $18...$9??? Well she charged both of us $13... I am not a math wiz but I can do simple math... I take that back... I am a math wiz but THIS is simple math... anyone should know it! 
This place could be a good hang out if they hire someone who can count and is attentive (after all that&#39;s your job). I liked the homey feeling of that place, they had nice booths, lots of TVs and decorated with anything sport related."

Apparently asking for a booth in an uncrowded restaurant is more than the hostess can take, she seated us and walked away say 3 times &#34;they wanted a booth&#34;  while shaking her head side to side.

Lots of TVs there though (I think there were 12? TVs placed around the bar/restaurant) so if you&#39;re in the area &amp; need to catch a game, you should check it out. It&#39;s located in the west end of the Elk Grove Crossing strip mall near Panera, so there&#39;s plenty of parking. 

Food: good bar food but not amazing. Liked the mozzarella stick appetizer - instead of breading it, they wrap the cheese in a tortilla &amp; fry it. Kind of like a tamale - it was pretty good. I got the cheesy beef, which they say &#34;is the best beef in Chicago&#34;. It was alright, but not really spectacular. It reminded me of Portillos, and I&#39;ve had better. Tasty but juuust a little bland. My friend got the chicken wings (hot) which were nice &amp; hot but too breaded. The championship fries (waffle fries with melted nacho cheese + bacon) were delicious though. I definitely recommend them. The pizzookie (pizza cookie+ice cream) hit the spot for my sweet tooth craving especially because it comes warm &amp; delicious. Lots of different specials for every night of the week; my friend got a $3 mini-pitcher of Miller Lite which was about 2.5 glasses. 

Atmosphere: Since I was there for the Blackhawks Roadwatch the place was filled with Blackhawks fans. The Hawks beat the Predators 4-1 so there was a lot of screaming &amp; singing &#34;Chelsea Dagger&#34; that night - so I can&#39;t say what it would be like otherwise. While I was there it was loud, noisy and filled with hockey talk, like a mini-UC, which is supposed to be the point (we were even clapping &amp; yelling when they played the anthem). As a Hawks fan, I definitely had fun, although there was one table that wanted to watch the BC/USC game and kept trying to get the server to change one of the TVs. Whenever they got a server to succeed, a bunch of other tables would complain, it&#39;d be switched back &amp; you&#39;d see the server get scolded by management. Sorry College Bowl-watchers, but since the bar was the &#34;Official Chicago Blackhawks Bar&#34; for the night, you probably should&#39;ve just gone somewhere else. 

The place is a decent sized restaurant-bar. Booths along the front wall (about 4 or so), a little more than 15 free-floating tables, and then a kind of smallish bar that seats maybe 15 people. If there&#39;s an event, I&#39;d call ahead and see if you can make a reservation although my friend &amp; I lucked out and got half of a booth because we said we&#39;d share with strangers. (Note: if said stranger sits down with his 2 kids and proceeds to tell you he is a professional wrestler despite looking like a shorter, portly Stanley Tucci, it&#39;s best to smile politely and then act distracted the rest of the time. Even if his kids are adorable little hockey fans.)

Service: the hostess was incredibly polite and helpful, although you could see she was a bit overwhelmed with the sheer number of people that had shown up. The place turned into a standing-room-only place because all the hawks fans, but she did a good job. The server was friendly but obviously distracted, and didn&#39;t really clear the plates or notice refills unless specifically asked. I&#39;m going to give her a pass this time, given how busy the place was. 

Cost: Wings + Italian Beef + Fries + Mozzarella sticks + Pizzookie + Coke + mini pitcher of Miller Lite + Bud Lite = less than $40. Most entrees were just under $10, and there are plenty of drink specials and daily specials. 

Overall, if you live in the area, it&#39;s a great sports bar/restaurant to go and watch your favorite game at, while having some decent food for not too bad of a cost. Otherwise, the typical sports bar near wherever you live will probably be just as good as this place."

I have yet to try their food items, but will be looking to order for catering as their prices look pretty decent for that.

My son calls it &#34;softee bread&#34; and he is totally right--it&#39;s warm, soft and pillowy...so easy to eat more than one. 

Lina&#39;s is a small shop that focuses on typical Filipino cooking staples--sauces, vinegars, canned goods, frozen and fresh items.  So if you want to make casava cake--you can pretty much all the ingredients here.  Lumpia?  they have your wrappers. Filipino spaghetti?  They have ready made sauce.

 There is also a small kitchen and hot food warmer which usually offers about 5-6 hot items you can purchase--like longanisa (spicy sweet sausage), dinuguan (blood stew), pinakbet (veggie stew), and another favorite-the BBQ pork sticks. They also have some other baked items brought in from another bakery--like sapin sapin, puto, kuchinta. 

One Friday night I was hoping to grab dinner here for me and my son and they were out of almost all the hot food. And it was only 5pm!  Out of rice too!  Wha???? So we settled on the BBQ sticks (grilled to perfection with a sweet sticky glaze) some pandesal and fried tilapia. 
So If you&#39;re in the mood for something specific, best to call ahead.

The lady in the back kitchen saw us waiting to be helped but didn&#39;t help us or say hold on. She waited for a younger lady to serve us. 

They had like 8 bbq sticks and so we bought them all and the older lady looked angry that we bought them all. I mean shouldn&#39;t she be happy that we are buying her food.

I believe this place use to be another name, but the store layout still looks the same.
When you walk into the place, it&#39;s pretty small.  They try to put as much shelving items in their space.  No really, you can&#39;t have two shopping carts through the aisles.  
They have a lot of canned goods and in the back they have premade Filipino dishes in food warmers to bring home for lunch or dinner.  I haven&#39;t had a chance to try them, maybe next time when I&#39;m not in the mood to cook Filipino food.  You can also order pans of Filipino dishes as well for your parties.  There is also a section to buy freshly baked pandesal (sweet bread rolls).  
They have a small freezer section full of Filipino type of items from whole fishes, shredded coconut, to desserts like ube ice cream.  If you ask for help, they will help you.  They won&#39;t come up to you.  
I get their premade frozen lumpia (finger egg rolls), deep fry them individually frozen until golden brown and crispy SOOOOO good!  Don&#39;t forget the sweet and sour sauce.
I also buy Knorr Sinigang Tamarind Powder and Kare Kare powder.  From time to time, I purchase a bag of sweet rice to make Arroz Caldo (a filipino Congee rice soup), yum.

She is often critical of take-out / restaurant food but is always happy with the food from Lina&#39;s...&#34;they are really good cooks&#34;.

The store is small...they sell a basic variety of Filipino/Asian grocery items. They have a steam table in the back with 6 entrees and a hot plate with cooked fish (Daing) and BBQ pork on a stick. They also sell some fresh baked breads (my kids love the pan de sal), and some items from other places (I saw cassava from Sariling Atin) there.

Entrees vary, but may consist of Sinigang, Nilaga, Caldereta, Bopis, Diniguan, Afritada, etc. A 16 oz. container runs $6/$7/$8 for veggie/chicken&amp;fish/beef, and 32 oz. containers are a little less than double ($12 for a chicken entree). 6 pieces of pan de sal will set you back $2.50.

They have a couple tables to eat at, but I seldom see customers dining in.

Service is friendly. I pick up food there any time I&#39;m in the vicinity."

But anyways I tried their beef caldereta and oh my I cannot explain the taste so I did throw it and went back to the usual place where we use to buy ulam The Bakehouse on Bloomingdale Rd. I was so dis-appointed.  I also question the safety of their cook food because it is mix with grocery but oh well at least I tried their food and I will not recommend it at all.

My husband and I decided to check it out and were really happy we did! The construction on Irving Park Rd. makes it a little difficult to get in but it&#39;s worth it. I had the cecina (marinated thin steak) and chicken tacos. My husband got the same meats but in a gringas (kinda like an open quesadilla). We added sour cream and avocado. We were not a big fan of the horchata, but overall our food with the salsa verde was delicious and affordable!! The owner Edgar and his cook were super nice. Definitely will be coming again! 

***UPDATE***
We went again to Taco Tuesday a week later, and was told they switched the horchata to a homemade recipe. It had a wonderful balance of sweet cinnamon and milky texture. The horchata is worth a try! Oh and their fresh, homemade guacamole which is not yet on the published menu is so yummy. You can even request the level of spicy because they make it for you right after you order. Thanks again Taco Tuesday for another wonderful meal!"

My friends ordered a chile relleno taco and a steak burrito. They really enjoyed the food as well. It is perfectly seasoned and the flavor a merge so well in your mouth I am getting hungry just thinking about it! The owner said they are expanding their menu. They are still pretty new.

Wednesdays all Pizza is half off no matter ingredients or size order it ANY WAY you want and then it&#39;s half price . Saturday half off pizza Dine in only. 
And now they have gaming machines with cash payouts .
They have on Tuesday nights a 5 dollar Buffet that has a pretty good selection  of pasta with 4 or 5 different sauces , fresh Pizza from cheese to different toppings , salad , hamburgers good sized ones and hot dogs . They have a nice family dining room separate from the bar and games and also Dart leagues .

They have the incredible 1/2 price pizza (eat in or take out) on Wednesday and Saturday (eat in).  Pizza even on the 1/2 price days - they don&#39;t skimp on the ingredients cheese, sausage etc.  I don&#39;t know how they make any $$ off the 1/2 price days.  

Have inexpensive lunch specials Monday through Friday $2.99, a monthly &#34;customer appreciation&#34; meal that is FREE with the purchase of a $3.00 drink!

The place is like a pub and seems to be a popular hangout. I&#39;ve always seen it hiding in a shopping center and never expected it when I walked in.

Well, my husband and I were driving home from the hawks game and feeling adventurous, so we decided to give it a whirl. 

There was one other family inside, when we went to the counter. We looked at the menu for a while when one of the younger workers said, if you&#39;re eating here you can take the menu and sit down. So, we did just that. 

Anyway, we both ordered the chicken shawarma, I got fries and the hubs got rice.  The wait wasn&#39;t too long, and he brought us our waters after the food came out. Now, the food was delicious.  Such great flavor.

1. I was expecting something like Fazzolis. I live Fazzolis. Fast food Italian that use to be in the Chicago area but they all were shut down in this area. Well this place is far from it. And it was sort of expensive.

2. Not really Italian. It&#39;s more middle eastern with many items on their menu very middle eastern. Actually, everyone there from customers to employees were middle eastern. Lol. Nothing wrong with that, but I felt that was the only demographic they were targeting. There was even middle eastern plaques above the cashier.

3. The interior was very 80&#39;s like and looked very drub. Cheap napkins, plates, and silverware. 

I felt very awkward being there. I really felt like they were losing money. However, the customer service was good and the food was good. I might come here again for pasta dishes, but they need some work to do. It ain&#39;t so Fazzolies though."

Their gyros are amazing, especially when they&#39;re on their pizza. The fries are, honestly, the best fries I&#39;ve ever had--just crunchy enough to know it&#39;s cooked well but soggy enough to make it enjoyable while engulfing them. I love how they give cans of pop as opposed to every other place that gives you a watered down drink that doesn&#39;t resemble, in taste, what you asked for. There&#39;s a lot more to their menu, that I&#39;ve heard is great as well, but I just get the same thing every time so I wouldn&#39;t know.

Over all the food is good but I would give this place 5 star if the service was slightly better. I usually go for the spicy Chicken TIkka Pizza or Spicy Gyro pizza. The other must have item on the menu is Ham Burger with Gyro meat.

Super slow service and okay gyro &#34;meh. I&#39;ve experienced better&#34; sums up the experience here. This is a great restaurant if you have friends that need to eat halal. The prices are okay and there are few places where you can get halal t-bone steak for 20 dollar ish. I ended up stopping by during AMEX small business day and got two orders of gyro to go. I was surprised as it was lunch and there was no one there. After taking my order I sat and waited for 20 minutes for the food to come out. Albiet the gyros were hot and the fries were fresh although small. I still can&#39;t imagine what happens if this places ever gets busy. The gyro were above average and the yogurt sauce help balance the grease. I wish this place good luck, but with the marketing going on so far and the business volume I would not expect this place to stay running for long. Just as in the past this was wendy&#39;s, el pollo loco, and some kabob place.....

Pro: fresh food

Cons: very slow service, average prices, small parking lot

Hidden gem: 
There is a lunch special, but I forgot what the deal entails...."
italian-express-hanover-park-hanover-park,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,1,1,459,125,iXcaij0k5815QOSQ3guRKA,3.0,2013-05-31,"Having visited another place called Italian Express in Glendale Heights, I&#39;ve had this second Italian Express located off of Barrington Road and Irving Park in Hanover Park on my &#34;to visit list&#34; for quite some time. I finally had the opportunity to stop by here and give it a try. The first thing that&#39;s worth noting is that this place is set up more like a typical fast food joint. However, it is a place where you sit, are given a menu and are waited on. 

What&#39;s interesting about both this and the Glendale Heights Italian Express is that it&#39;s more of a Pakistani restaurant than an Italian eatery. While they do have things like Pizza, the focus here is more on Halal meats and Middle Eastern cuisine. The inside here is fairly modern looking and very clean. It has quite a different decor than the Glendale Heights Italian Express. I&#39;m uncertain of how they are related, but the menu did not appear to be identical here either. After looking over their menu and considering my options I went for the jumbo hot dog with fries. 

Less than ten minutes after I ordered my food was brought to me. The hot dog I received came on a large thick roll similar to the Italian bread used throughout Chicagoland to serve Italian beef sandwiches. On the hot dog were pickle slices like those found on a hamburger, mustard, relish, onion slices and a few pieces of sliced tomato. The sausage itself was skinless and fairly thick (after all, it was listed as being a Jumbo all beef dog), it had a familiar taste though I can&#39;t immediately pinpoint the vendor. I&#39;d say the combination of condiments, somewhat hard bread and frank went together decently but the bread really wasn&#39;t the right fit for this kind of hot dog.

There were also fries with my hot dog, I had a few of these and they were pretty good. They had a very crisp outside with a nice potato paste on the inside. They were a little salty, but not particularly greasy, these were better than the hot dog was.

Overall, I liked this Italian Express considerably more than the one in Glendale Heights. I think it&#39;s an interesting place to visit with the fusion of Middle Eastern and Italian cuisine. While my hot dog wasn&#39;t fantastic and was a little pricey at around 6.00 with fries, I&#39;m going to give this place three stars. Decent food at a decent price but nothing that will blow your mind."

The owner is very nice, and the workers are genuine and always ready to assist you. I have not had one bad experience at this restaurant. Overall, the food is great, the customer service is great, and I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a yummy, filling meal.

We visited shortly after Christmas. We both wanted pasta and remembered this place was down the street. We enter and not a soul was in the place...well, one guy was, he was watching rugby (? I still don&#39;t even know if this was what was on) on a huge screen that came down from the ceiling. It appeared he worked there or knew the owner? 

Anyways, we walk in and awkwardly stand at the counter. There isn&#39;t a true menu display so we looked at a takeout menu. I started seeing food of middle eastern decent which should have been a red flag. We still ordered 2 pasta dishes, one with meatballs, the other with sausage and 2 drinks. We sit down and drinks were brought out to us. It wasn&#39;t a long wait for the food but when it finally came out I was pretty surprised. There was probably 20 cents worth of pasta and each dish and the meal cost $30. The meat was pretty questionable too. I took a small bite of my sausage and it tasted like breakfast sausage. They also gave us 2 rolls which were decent as they were soft and warm. 

Sorry but we won&#39;t be back."

First of all - don&#39;t be fooled by the name, it&#39;s not &#34;Italian&#34; only. It started as an Italian place with pizza and yes - they still have really GOOD pizza! But, it became famous for their spicy gyros! The spicy gyros and regular gyros are amazing as are almost all of their burgers and sandwiches. The fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside....delicious!

Get the following and you will not be disappointed:
Spicy or Regular Gyro
Gyro Pizza or any pizza
Buffalo Wings
Rib Eye Steak Sandwich (ask for it without ketchup)!
Cheeseburger with Gyros

The place itself is nice and clean and the wait staff is friendly.

Overall, it&#39;s honestly one of the best places for really flavorful and freshly made fast food."

Serves same menu as the location at Glendale Heights and Devon. I normally do carry out or delivery but decided to dine-in with the family today.

PROS - Great food, especially their steaks. Nice ambience and interior decor.

CONS - Service could be improved. A kid was serving us who was good at following up if we needed something e.t.c., but just lacked the basic waiting skill. Could not take directions well (brought out appetizer and dinner rolls with main course even though we said otherwise). Cutlery was missing and not enough plates brought out. When we asked for a to go box, empty dishes,plates were not taken away to make room for to go boxes.

Another caveat was the steak entrees. Usually at the other locations, the steaks are served up with 2 sides. This location does not honor that. As a franchise, I would think one should be consistent on how they serve their meals.

Other than that, great place to try out ."

Hard to explain weird mish-mosh food selection -- I ordered a rib-eye steak sandwich, it showed up with ketchup and pickles and it tasted nothing like steak.

Overall this place was great - the ambiance was nice, there was a lot of good food consumed and the entertainment (projection system for Thursday night football and the NBA on TNT) really put a complete dining experience on this place.

Pros:
1. For all the Muslims that want to visit the place, I found out that the place serves Zabiha-Halal meat. 
2. The decor and ambiance was very inviting, clean and comfortable. The place really looks nice. Its a casual dining spot. 
3. There was a projection system setup so we could enjoy some NFL and NBA on a Thursday night. Definitely a good touch.
4. Food was good - it was served fresh and hot and in generous portions. We ended up ordering three XL pizzas - one with Spicy Gyros, a Meat Lovers and a Chicken Tikka Pizza. The Meat Lovers by far was the best of all of the three. 
5. Pricing was Reasonable - for 15 people, pizza and appetizers we spent about 100. 

Cons:
1. Service was a little slow - not a deal breaker considering the place is pretty new. So I would expect this to improve.
2. The sampler basket was disappointing. I love appetizers and I felt that the onion rings were over cooked, the mushrooms didn&#39;t have much flavor and the buffalo wings left a lot to be desired. 

Overall a very promising place - I would definitely recommend."

If I could give 0 stars I would to be quite frank.  So I saw this new restaurant and I am all for Italian food so I thought I&#39;d try it out one afternoon.

I thought I&#39;d give them the benefit of the doubt so I ordered but to my dismay there was little in the way of Italian choices.  I did end up ordering a pasta dish.  With my dish I got a side which I had the choice of potato, rice, coleslaw or pasta. Wait that doesn&#39;t make sense. First, why would I have another carb as a side or why would I have pasta as a side for a pasta dish?????? Weird. I had my order to go and when I got home the paper bag was soaked with oil and fell apart on my counter. Ugh!!! I hate that!!! I took a couple bites and couldn&#39;t eat anymore.

The fam and I had been wanting to try this place for a while, tonight we got the chance. 

Entering into a completely empty restaurant is always a little daunting, but I still had a good feeling about this place.  We ordered at the counter and grabbed a table.   Food was served hot and quick. 

Had the hummus and the spicy Moggo fries as appetizers.  The hummus was just eh...but the fries were tasty. 

I ordered the chicken tikka platter and subbed the rice with an extra serving of salad.  The salad was straight up bagged salad, but it was fresh and crisp so no stars lost for that.  The chicken was tasty and juicy, and the portions were VERY generous, which is always a plus in my book! 

We also had the chicken tikka pizza, an onion &amp; green pepper pizza, and a mushroom pizza.  The pizzas were slightly larger in size considering it&#39;s listed as &#34;individual- size&#34; but again, absolutely no issues with that.  The crust was light yet sturdy, sauces were tasty, and cooked just right. 

After ordering and paying, I had the urge to try one of their fresh juices.   I settled on &#34;Popeye&#39;s Arms,&#34; and it was good...would&#39;ve been better if served on ice.

Not only was the food great, but the speed and service was very gratifying.  I went to pay for my juice and the extra pitas we ordered, and the gentleman behind the counter comped it after learning it was our first visit.

I was planning on getting chicken tikka pizza and falafel (based on the reviews). I didn&#39;t want 3 pizzas, so I ended up not getting the check in, even tho I marked it on yelp. Also, you don&#39;t need it, that&#39;s their special in the restaurant.

The guy working wasn&#39;t very friendly and I felt a little uncomfortable, but I still ordered chicken tikka pizza and falafel pita. Came out to $16. Kinda pricey for a 10 inch pizza and a pita with barely anything in it. 

I got excited when I got my food because it smelled so good! Like garlic bread or something buttery and garlicy.

Well... the falafel was salty as f and it seemed like it was mostly made of flour. It was very bready. 4 falafel with one slice of tomato a little lettuce and a few cubes of cucumber.... not worth it.

You&#39;d think 10 inches is a lot, but when I opened the box, it was pretty small. For $9, I expect way more. The pizza was also salty as f and bitter. I just saw another review mentioning the bitterness and I think it&#39;s because of the garlic. 

I thought this place would be really good from the reviews, but it was just eh. The only flavor in my mouth is salt right now. If they toned down the salt, it might be a little more edible. But I doubt I&#39;ll be back."

It doesn&#39;t taste as good when you take it home. The sandwiches and platters are delicious, though i think it can use more rice.

Although the falafel was delicious, I wasn&#39;t a fan of the falafel sandwich. It was only $4.99 during lunch time, but it was just four pieces of falafel in a pita with lettuce. I would have rather ordered two orders or falafel (8 total) for $4 and share it with family.

I believe the sandwich cost $5.95 (dinnertime), and was worth every penny.  You will find slightly less expensive ones out there, but they suck in comparison.  

My pita was overstuffed with four huge falafels along with tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and tahini sauce.  Hot sauce and Tszaziki sauce (I think) came on the side.  I also ordered a side of hummus.  Not sure if you can just ask for some hummus on your falafel sandwich, but I like ordering a full side because it comes with that delicious oil on top!  The side of hummus also included a couple of olives and, of course, pita bread!  

Restaurant was clean, including the bathroom, I mean SPOTLESS clean.  That means a lot to me.

I expected the employees to be like street vendor employees of New York, due to their restaurant name.  So I expected the worst.   Last year I went to NYC and stayed right in Manhattan.  I ate A LOT of street food because it&#39;s damn good.  But the vendors are jerks.  One jerk charged me 7 dollars for a lousy hot dog!  The hotel concierge told me that basically I acted too much like a tourist and that they could smell me a mile away.  Then the hotel concierge held his hand out for a tip.  Geesh!

Back to the employees here at NYFPFaG:  They were super nice and answered all of my questions without being mean or rude.   They made sure I left with my takeout order with everything I needed (including utensils, seasonings, etc.)

So if you&#39;re craving some NY food and don&#39;t want to travel to NY, give this place a try!  And if you&#39;re not craving NY food, take a break from your Italian beef sandwich and try this place instead.  You&#39;ll be pleasantly satisfied."

Would be nice to know how much food you&#39;re getting before you order but it&#39;s a good problem to have. Will definitely be back!"

Seriously amazing. I&#39;m in town for work and I try not to go to chain restaurants when I travel. Picked up the menu at the hotel and saw chicken tikka pizza. BOOM sign me up. I love chicken tikka at Indian restaurants and I love pizza. NY Famous Pizza DEFINITELY didn&#39;t disappoint. Some of the reviews mentioned spicy mogo fries so I got those with my pizza. Legit, the best fries I&#39;ve had in my life. Seriously, it has this spicy red sauce on it and the texture is a little thicker. It&#39;s made of cassava and deep fried from what I understand. The portion was super generous for the price ($9) and the chicken was cooked perfectly. This makes B Dubs Mumbai masala My roommate/coworker went with the spicy chicken wrap which was HUGEEE for the price. He got the regular mogo fries because he can&#39;t handle the heat. Whatever, his loss. Delivery was quick and the flavors are unique. Pretty glad I skipped the Sarpinos offer and took a shot here. I&#39;ll order here again to try some of their other items next time I&#39;m in town. Boston and these chain places needs to step their game up!"

Time of the delivery: Late dinner

I have used this place in the past and by far, this is one of the best pizza in the Western burbs.

I ordered medium size pizza (feeds about 2-3 people).  I got pineapple, green pepper and half pepperoni/half sausage.  I am a weird one, so I made sure I asked for a pie cut.  Sorry, but pizza is not meant to be cut in squares, at that point it&#39;s just cracker with toppings....

Their traditional crust is something in between thin &amp; deep dish.  I LOVE that crust!  I don&#39;t know what it is about that crust, it&#39;s just good!  They delivered very quickly and efficiently!  Overall great experience!

A+!"

The pizza comes in a bag instead of a box. That is kind of unusual and somewhat inconvenient, but it also feels authentic at the same time!"

This is not a fancy place. People show up and get their pizza and go. There&#39;s a couple tables you could eat at if you wanted to, though really no one does. They do tons of business to the bar next door. This place is so outta my way now, but I do love to grab pizza here when I can. If you spend over a certain amount, they toss you a free litre of RC cola.

Their crust is soft, not crispy. The thin crust is soft and thin and the regular is soft and doughy, and I weirdly like both, so I like to mix it up. I don&#39;t know about their foods beyond pizza so this review is entirely based off the pizza. And the pizza isn&#39;t super fancy either, it just has that &#34;comfort food&#34; palate pleasing aspect that you keep coming back to."

I&#39;ve been coming here for years... They&#39;re very famous and busy during the football season. Their thin crust is the best.  Get the Italian beef and giardinera on thin crust. An 18&#34; with 2 toppings is only $21.60

They forgot our salads for both dinners.

More like a combo of a thin &amp; pan, but not as doughy as pan. The sauce is tasty and not overwhelming...and the right amount of cheese and ingredients.  

I&#39;ve only ordered delivery from here and just recently ordered a med reg pizza, combo beef sandwich, sub sandwich and baked clams.  I&#39;m giving 3 stars based on my recent order and on the rest of the food and service.  Pizza was delicious, no complaints.  baked clams also great, with large pieces of clam you could actually bite into and not all filling.

Not so great:  friend said beef sandwich was dry and tasted like it had been sitting for awhile..odd taste.  His sub sandwich consisted of a couple pieces of meat, with the remaining ingredients being all lettuce and tomato.  Delivery time?  was told 45 minutes and order did not arrive until over an hour and we were STARVING.

Two orders of baked mostaccolli (that came with no ricotta cheese plus cold mozzarella cheese on top) three side orders of meatballs (delicious actually!) an order of mozzarella sticks ( so overcooked there was no cheese inside) and garlic bread (that was a hockey puck). We called and complained ( we have ordered here for years and NEVER complained) and spoke with a manager named Ron who was beyond ignorant and had no cares about our complaints. We explained we were told 45-60 minutes for delivery even though it arrived at 92 minutes. (We still tipped the delivery driver and she apologized and gave us an extra one liter of RC for free that we told her we did not want). We explained to Ron how someone called back 25 minutes after we initially placed our order to clarify if we wanted mozzarella sticks and not cheese filled bread sticks and was still told the food would arrive within 30 minutes. Yet Ron was ignorant and fought with us on the phone for ten minutes when all we wanted for him to do is apologize.  But instead blamed it on the new guy. Seriously customer service along with great food is what people come back for, and every restaurant will not be perfect 100% of the time and thats okay and forgivable if your managers or staff is sympathetic to your customers concerns. You Ron failed. We have been customers since I lived in Glendale Heights over 10 years ago. I do not care about your $10 credit after ten minutes of you arguing with me, even when i offered to send you a text or email of the pictures of the food that was delivered.

Now, let&#39;s get past cosmetics because this place is great.  They have fresh, homemade breadsticks stuffed with cheese.  Their prices are more than reasonable.  A one-topping party size pizza (18 inches) will only set you back $16.  Phenomenal.  

I had the thin crust pizza.  It was the perfect dough.  Thin, but not crunchy, good bite without being too doughy.  The sausage was delicious.  Clearly fresh and generously topped.

My only complaint?  Soda in cans?  There was no option to buy larger containers.  For a group of people coming in, it was a bit annoying to have cans.

This is a pick up type location with two tables if you want to eat here.

SERVICE: 4/5

Pick Up- The ladies picking up the phone can be very rude. I am simple and know what I want so I have no issues. Ask questions and you will have problems. 

The guys at the counter are always nice and take care of you right away.

Delivery- Get to know your delivery drivers. Tip them very well. Most drivers know us and prioritize our orders so its hot and fresh. Oh and if you treat them well they bring you your free RC without having to ask them. 9/10 times the pizza arrives on time and hot.

Pizza: 5/5
Ingredients: Fresh. Delicious. 
Italian Beef Pizza- 5/5. Outstanding!
BBQ Chicken- 0/5. Sauce is horrible.

This pizza has lots of cheese; a mild, slightly sweet sauce; and a pillowey crust with crispy edges. The sausage is Chicago style - heavy with a little bit of spice at the end. (Exactly what I was looking for). The pepperoni comes under the cheese and is thinly sliced. Be excitedly aware: This is not a healthy pizza! This is a man&#39;s pizza.

Other reviewers mention that Joseph (and staff) are heavy handed with the toppings, but I personally enjoy that.  The thin crust is a little thin to hold up the weight of all that deliciousness, but you just gotta eat it fast (and then toaster oven it back to desired crispiness if you have leftovers) and expect it to be a bit messy.  

I also love the bread sticks (5 per order) which come with an amazing tomato sauce.  those two items--the thin crust pizza &amp; the cheese filled breadsticks--are basically the only things we order.  I think we always consider ordering something different, but just like our old standbys too much to deviate from the usual. 

Joseph&#39;s pizza has some coupons on their website for free liters of soda (like RC and all that... come on now, when&#39;s the last time you had RC?) and a few bucks off your order, but prices are reasonable.  Joseph&#39;s has become our go to pizza delivery spot."

I have went back and forth between the thin and the regular crust and honestly cannot say which one is the better of the two, I will actually have to declare a tie here.  I think their Sausage is very tasty, and would recommend that as the topping of choice.  I recently just dropped by for a lunch visit and tried getting random slices, and I was very happy.   Fresh, generous size, and hot, the perfect lunch slice!  I really want to try their baked mostacholli, or other offerings, but I cannot get myself to not order the pizza, lol.  I wish they were a little closer to me, so I did not have to drive and pick it up.  They do have a couple of tables where you can eat in there at, but the offerings inside are very basic, but it is better than not having that option at all.

The deliveries usually take 45mins to an hour and nothing before that. Which is fine because they make you aware of that when you order. 
Collect 20 of their yellow menus and you get a free pizza! ANY SIZE.
Also, it says on the menu that for every purchase $15 or more you receive a 1 liter bottle of soda but they don&#39;t give it to you unless you mention it. So if you don&#39;t know about it you probably won&#39;t get it.

Joseph&#39;s is actually REALLY good. I sometimes crave it, I&#39;ll even eat it cold...which in my book means it&#39;s pretty freaking good pizza.

This is a delivery and take out only joint that offers surprisingly generous amounts of toppings on everything at very reasonable prices. 

The first thing to notice about Joseph&#39;s is the value. While it might not be the cheapest pizza around, they certainly give you your moneys worth. Whether stuffed pizza or thin crust they absolutely do not skimp on toppings or any other ingredients. 

Their stuffed pizza is a thick stuffed (sauce on top, re-enforced crust) pizza with a very thick and flavorful sauce, the quality of the sauce, cheese and any toppings you get are fantastic. With that said I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the taste of their crust as it is a distinctive yet, to me somewhat bitter flavor. The thin crust pizza here is actually a bit better, their thin crust pizza is thin, crispy, the cheese and sauce used are spot on, and they pile on the toppings.

One other thing to note about Joseph&#39;s is that with any order greater than 9.00 you get a yellow menu. If you collect twenty yellow menu&#39;s you get a free sausage pizza. They also have &#34;Play the Pizza Maker&#34; scratch off cards. If you collect a cheese, sauce and dough card you get a free pizza. Unfortunately, the dough card appears to be the Joseph&#39;s pizza equivalent of the Boardwalk game piece for McDonald&#39;s Monopoly. In my workplace Josephs has been ordered a great many times and I&#39;ve not seen one dough card out of over 30.

Overall Joseph&#39;s is an excellent quality take out/ delivery pizza joint and I&#39;d recommend it if you happen to be in the area."

Crust: Had it been a little more crispy, it would have been the best crust I&#39;d ever had. It has potential/

Toppings: Wow, this sounds crazy but there were way too many for my liking. So much so that it was not possible to eat a slice without your hand becoming full of grease. However, that said -- the sausage had a great, fresh flavor. The cheese was really good. But I felt like the pizza sauce was missing some spice.

Atmosphere: It really is a carry out/delivery place so it&#39;s not great. 

Price: A baby cheese pizza, large sausage and pepperoni pizza, two cans of pop = $32.04. Way overpriced.

So yeah, it was &#34;ok&#34;. Nothing I&#39;d rave over. I won&#39;t likely try it again at that price either. Maybe the Pan or Deep Dish is better...at least the reviews make it seem that way."

Those two pieces of calamari tasted like cardboard with a rotten fish flavoring!  I&#39;m writing this review about an hour after eating the calamari so hopefully I don&#39;t get sick tonight.

I generally like to read the paper at breakfast so I opted for going to the River City Grille instead of ordering room service. Maybe because I wake up late or because everyone gets room service or because you would only stay at Hoffman Estates for business, the restaurant is never crowded. Luckily for me, that means the service is incredibly attentive and the food comes out fast!

True to Midwestern style, they serve hearty, generous portions that will definitely fill you up. The hash browns are very fried, there is meat in most of the menu items, and when the omelette has melted cheese inside, it&#39;s far from a delicate amount sprinkled on top. You&#39;re going to get as much cheese as you want and then some. But as long as you aren&#39;t vegan, the food is pretty good. The Broken Yolk Sandwich, in particular, is delicious. And the Frittata, which is supposed to be a healthier option, is also good and comes without the tempting fried potatoes. Service is quick and friendly and all in all, River City Grille is a solid hotel breakfast spot (I can&#39;t speak to lunch or dinner)."

Or they make you wanna smack yo granny. I arrived at River City Grille knowing two things. One was that it was inside the hotel I was staying at. The other thing was that it was still open and serving food. Convenience and food availability were the order of the evening.
I ordered pretzel bread with cheese sauce but let my coworker/travel buddy nosh on that. I did try a piece and it was pretty tasty.
For dinner I had the filet with fries and 4 cheese mac n&#39; cheese. The filet was a decent cut of meat but overpriced by about $8 for what it was. The fries were so forgettable I ate all of three of them and gave up. The mac n&#39; cheese was mediocre at best. I love mac n&#39; cheese. I love all types and even enjoy Kraft. I would eat Kraft over this mac n&#39; cheese any day. The pasta was overcooked, it was barely warm and the cheese sauce was bland and uneventful. I blackened the bowl with enough pepper to kill a mongoose and still thought it lacked any flavor... it was the yellow blackhole of flavor destruction. I finished most of it because for what this meal was going to cost I needed to eat more than just the filet.
I also tried a bit of an apple crumble pie with vanilla ice cream and that was pretty tasty. I could have demolished the whole thing... but I also haven&#39;t had any sweets in nearly two months so it may have seemed way more awesome than it actually was.
This place boils down to being too expensive for what it is... bland food that is poorly prepared. But really... isn&#39;t the point of a hotel restaurant to provide food when nothing else is open? So in that vein it does it&#39;s job. 
Meh."

Half/half fried chicken
The breading was good. It kinda reminds you chicken tender crispy and seasoning on the breading and juicy inside.

The marinating one was amazing. The fact that breading was crispy it was able to keep chicken to have crispy texture without getting soggy. The sauce was well balanced sweet and tangy.  Tip: ask for their hotter version sauce on the side

Spicy omurice
It was really good solid omurice with good gravy and spicy sauce. I would recommend regular one if you do not like spicy food. 

Overall 
The food was awesome, service needs little work, I think they can improve on the pricing of the foods.

Instead of a quiet setting with lots of banchan and traditional dishes, you instead get lots of K-Pop on TCL screens with a menu really focused on the Beer and Fried Chicken combo. Prices are alright, not cheap but for Korean it&#39;s pretty cheap in comparison to the amount of meat you&#39;re getting (generous portions). The cooking overall is a bit light on flavor, prepared quickly, and with fast friendly service. Here are some thoughts on different items I tried.

Fried chicken: Good texture, kind of like broasted chicken -- without seeming too oily. But a bit light on marination and flavor. Decent price for the amount of chicken you get for an order.

Three flavor popcorn chicken: Could&#39;ve been a bit more crispy -- but it does come with a pretty generous helping of meat (although it&#39;s also pretty expensive). The sweet and spicy chicken isn&#39;t too sweet or spicy (not much more than the sauce packets you typically get at Asian restaurants) and the honey gold (which was my favorite) was also a bit mild. The plain one was a bit too light on flavor for me.

Jjamppong - huge bowl with a generous amount of seafood and noodles. I did enjoy the broth quite a bit (even after coming back from Korea the previous week) although it has a pretty strong spicy kick to it.

Pork cutlet - Huge portion of pork that was breaded and fried pretty well. The sauce was not as sweet or acidic as I&#39;m used to -- which can both be a positive (since it seemed healthier) or a negative if you&#39;re used to a very tasty tonkatsu sauce.

Omelet rice - Not sure why we don&#39;t see this item on local menus more often. This is really an improvement over normal fried rice with lots of egg flavor, a bit more chewy rice (since it keeps a higher level of moisture), with a nice and creamy / sweet sauce. The amount of sesame oil in the rice was a little more than I would&#39;ve liked, but still an enjoyable comfort food.

Overall, if you want to try more modern Korean food at reasonable prices -- definitely visit MOWA (or TTOWA which is also in Arlington Heights)."

Couldn&#39;t find out what made them worth that much and didn&#39;t order to find out but later when talking to owner I asked about it and she said &#34;too much? We make it 2.99&#34; we got 2 types of popcorn chicken. And stir fry chicken all was very tasty but no side dishes but that was ok as they were big portions. I made have given it 4 stars except the 4 tv&#39;s playing kpop was a little much. It almost seems like they only want to cater to Koreans but not really a Korean neighborhood so making it a little more comfy for the neighbors would help. Can&#39;t see the wife and me walking over to the bar like we used to when it was Danny&#39;s and watching Kpop videos.

Reading previous reviews made us skeptical. We were in fear of a dry burger.... well it wasn&#39;t there tonight. My burger was perfect! I ordered the Kuma burger, yum! I&#39;m craving one now, so moist, juicy and perfectly tasty. The bread is really good but a bit too hearty.

My friend ordered the neurosis burger. She was also happy with her order. Medium rare actually came as ordered. She still had the same issues with a &#34;hearty&#34; bun. 

The portions are large. Even their side salad is a meal. This place is an ideal place to share.

Jalapeño poppers are delicious! I would definitely order that again. It was kinda odd though that the &#34;hotness&#34; was inconsistent. But it was still tasty. The raspberry sauce only makes it better!

Chips, nice a crispy. Portions are generous so come hungry.

As for atmosphere, reviews said this place is loud. We were a little concerned before coming if it would be a good place to talk and catch up. It was fine.

As for service, we were seated right away. Our server was helpful and answered all our questions. Food arrived hot and our water glasses were filled. I look forward to my next visit here. Mmmm my new favorite burger place."

It&#39;s a burger place but you can get any of their fun/unique burgers with a black bean veggie burger or chicken instead so easy to make it work for those who don&#39;t like beef.

However this Kumas is in a really preppy area of the suburbs and it just seems like a weird fit IMO. The metal is kind of loud, but its not like being on the dance floor at the CLUB...

I went here on a date and forgot that they played metal so I just doubled down on loving metal and she ended up being okay with it, but I would definitely think about that before you bring your typical Adele-listening lady here. 

Our sever was cool, she was helpful  with offering an opinion and kept the water and drinks full. Drinks were fine, maybe a little expensive, but in this neighborhood of the burbs its expected. 

The Kuma burger was okay, but i thought it was actually pretty bland and it ended up making me sick to my stomach. I think I needed to make like 4 trips to the bathroom during the rest of this date. 

So all in all I went to Kumas and I ended up with an upset stomach, a 14 dollar bland burger, and a happy date. Mixed bag night for sure!"

1 upon arrival place was inviting, atmosphere was unique.

2 place was super busy, music was not so loud which is fine- Rob Zombie type of music.

3 TV around the place to watch sports, place super clean and staff very friendly.

4 when we got there my fiance and I wanted to sit at the bar but it was so packed no room for us so bar staff was so nice and attentive and they started us with drinks and as soon as the 1st couple left they looked out for us so we could sit down. 

5 drinks are good, we also had their signature burger with the fried egg inside which was delicious MUST TRY EVERYONE.  It is so big that you can split it with a friend or loved one.

6 fries are amazing.

7 never made it to the ladies room.

8 rest of the experience was really cool, this place is very unique and has its own touch and nice counter tops I would come back here."

The waiter was very helpful in making some really hard decisions and here&#39;s how it played out:

1) Mac &amp; Cheese w/bacon and broccoli: some of the best mac I&#39;ve ever had. Honestly, could eat this all day if health was not an issue
2) Absu Burger: I love spicy and this did not really do the trick. I think High on Fire or Pantera would have been a better choice. At the end of the day, the meat was cooked right but it does not have a lot of flavor. The toppings help but otherwise it was bland.

I did not have any drinks but their beer selection is awesome! Luckily we came fairly early on a Sunday night so there was no wait. I&#39;d be willing to give this place another chance with another spicy burger!"

I can&#39;t decide if I like the mac and cheese better or the burger better. I have a new obsession with brie cheese and pears and thats what I got on my burger, so I can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t love it BUT the mac and cheese was absolutely amazing. The taste of sun dried tomatoes on the warm mac and cheese was amazing!
I think the thing I appreciated the most about this place was the fact that any beef burger could be replaced with a chicken burger or a veggie burger. This should be something that is offered more often at restaurants. I am not a vegetarian, but this puts a whole new spin to someone who is vegetarian, they can now eat any burger they want! 

The inside of this place was cool and there were a lot of beers here! This seems like a good place to hang out and have a few beers (and mac and cheese :))"

The pros:

* the food is delicious
* the menu isn&#39;t overbearing
* the drinks are good
* the food comes out quickly
* the menu is unique, and has a wide variety
* the waitstaff was super kind

The cons:
* their goal is to have every plate come out the same so they don&#39;t like to do modifications (so that others don&#39;t ask for it)
* they have burgers...lots of burgers...and few other options
* the shirts are ridiculously expensive

The Meh:
* the prices
* the calories

This place is just phenomenal. It&#39;s a great suburb joint to visit -- and eat a cheat meal at.

I feel like this gem is a treasure for the suburbs. And music isn&#39;t insanely loud, but fits the mood."

Definitely the burger was not as good as the Chicago, however I do like the fact that this location has more space to breath..and it&#39;s easier to find parking. 
Food Technicalities- I think I&#39;ve tried all of their burgers at the Chicago location by now, however at this location I ordered the Pantera burger-medium well w chips..only thing I liked was their house made ranchero salsa and roasted poblano.  Patty felt really dry, bacon- well it&#39;s hard to go wrong w bacon, and the chips were just ok..lays could have been the same..
Mac and cheese was good, but not the best as it&#39;s hyped..


In nut shell, I think m done w Kumas for a while..
Pros:
Good selection of draft beers..
Relatively quicker service..
More room to sit and breath
Ease of parking 
Close to wood field mall

Cons:

It was great because it was in walking proximity to us from the office. Came in on a Sunday afternoon and this place was pretty dense with people already. I heard very good things about it and wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. What I thought was really odd is the Metallica playing in the background because as I was trying to eat my food, there is this loud thump from the music making me feel uncomfortable as I was eating. 

Didn&#39;t get the chance to try the Mac &amp; cheese but will be back for it. What&#39;s awesome about the menu is how customizable it is. You can basically choose any protein to put into your burger and all the different options they do offer for you to add onto your burger.

Heard about this place for many years when it opened in Chicago. Sat outside because of the music (not a big fan of metal). Ordered the Iron maiden burger which was delicious but not earth shattering.
The fries were too salty and a little soggy. The service was nonexistent with the server not coming to check on us after the order (I had to find him to get the check).

I recommend the Assembly for good burgers."

Now, I&#39;m married and have a child living in the suburbs driving a Camry. Needless to say, I&#39;m in a different life stage than I was several years ago. As excited as I was that Kuma&#39;s was opening up in Schaumburg, I quickly learned that it just didn&#39;t feel the same. 

Parents, this place is not kid friendly unless your child loves Megadeth and Metallica. The music is loud but that might be a good thing if you have a new born that does well with loud background noise. If you child doesn&#39;t fall into one of these categories, then make sure that you know what to expect ahead of time. 

Otherwise, the food is still kick-ass delicious. To me, the food tasted just as good as the other locations in the city. Don&#39;t forget to order the mac and cheese and fried pickles. This month&#39;s burger special had a crab cake topped with an arugula salad. With the new location, Kuma&#39;s easily has the best burger in Schaumburg.

When you first walk in you&#39;re hit with the music. And it&#39;s loud. On top of that there are metal music videos playing on the TVs, eah whatever right? No. I saw one video that was all recordings of eyes...some that would make even the not squeamish, stomach churn...cause mine did.

The crowd in there was not what I was expecting at all either. But I guess that&#39;s what happens when you set up in the burbs!

On to the positive!! Our waitress was super nice and knowledge of the whole menu and made great recommendations based off our tastes. We split bacon broccoli Mac and cheese as an appetizer between four of us and it was just enough and very yummy to satisfy until dinner. All the burgers are named after different bands, kinda fun. Mine was the Sourvein! It was basically chicken and waffles on a cheeseburger with bacon.

OK, I am going to quote an Elite Yelpers 3-star review and make fun of him for it.

&#34;Burgers are good but the place is A LOT smaller than I thought. Also I don&#39;t like how they play loud ROCK MUSIC and have zombie drawings all over the place? What is this? It&#39;s like a Hipster / zombie / IPA beer Burger joint? We&#39;re not in the city dude, we&#39;re in Schaumburg. &#34;

This Elitie is right about one thing, at least. Kuma&#39;s Corner has killer burgers. It is also heavy metal themed, so there are old metal album covers on the walls. And the music isn&#39;t uncommonly loud, but it&#39;s definitely guitar-driven rock. 

Seems like a jerk move to acknowledge a place has great food, and then give them 3 stars for being small, but whatever. I guess our man in Schaumburg would rather eat at TGI Fridays with a parking lot big enough for him to roam in and Top 10 greatest hits playing on infinite repeat. *Shudders*

So, OK, time to stop pillorying my fellow suburbanites and get to the meat of the review. Kumas is a ton of fun. I love the spot. Long beer lists. The burgers are better than good, and honestly the pricing is reasonable. Get blitzed, have a burger, take in the rock ambiance. Have a good time!"

I&#39;ve been here w few times and the food is just as great as what you get in the city. If you&#39;ve been to the original Kuma&#39;s, you know what to expect. Let me talk about what&#39;s different in Schaumburg. 

There is a nice little patio area where you can eat outside. We haven&#39;t been out there yet, usually due to the crowds or weather, but I&#39;ll definitely wait for outdoor seating once it gets warmer. The waiting line is also a bit more sophisticated-you give them your phone number, and there is a website app that keeps track of your spot. Yes, he waits are still long and can take up to 2 hours (or longer if the weekend). So get there early, put your name down, and chillax at Nordstrom Rack or something (because there will not be a seat at the bar!). 

Service is friendly, and the food is great. Be warned that every location has their own BOTM (Burger of the Month) and Mac and Cheese of he month. Also, my only gripe about this location is that it&#39;s a little too hardcore on the music-it&#39;s way too loud for any sort of conversation or human sound. At least I can talk to and enjoy my friends if I had to the city location. Turn that down a bit, and we just may have a suburban Kuma&#39;s complete equivalent!"

I was totally psyched to check out this location since I obviously never made it to the Belmont joint, which had been on my burger list for yrs....I knew it was gonna knock my socks off..
(or so I thought)..
Awesome reviews, friend recommendations..and yes, beastly burgers...

I needed to get this full-on burger feast and went in with high expectations...
At noon on a weekday, to my delight...place was chill..no wait...plenty of open seating..I dug the industrial/rock vibe..yep, music hits you as soon as you enter...but I was cool with it. Not really a Metal fan, but that wasn&#39;t why I was here...I got the feeling the ambiance here changes drastically at night...

I can&#39;t tell you how many times my eyes circled the burger options....I love variety, but it always gets the best of me and the more choices, the harder it is for me to make a decision...
I finally pinned down 2...Lair of the Minotaur OR Botm...Sourvein...
I was so torn...really I was..in fact, I asked our waitress if she could surprise me, which she wasn&#39;t keen on doing  - even when I said &#34;Really, it&#39;s OK...I&#39;d be fine with either&#34;...
A part of me wanted to go crazy adventurous with the Sourvein...hefty bacon, cheddar, blackened chicken tender (not crispy), topped with maple syrup drizzled waffle strips...
The Lair...sounded so up my alley though - love brie, pancetta w/bourbon (my new fave vice) poached pear...

Sourvein ($16) won as she brought up a valid point - I could order the Lar anytime, but not the BOTM.  Decision made!  Due to the overwhelming famous Mac &amp; Cheese reviews...we got this to share, but went with the Lobster Mac &amp; Cheese (of the month) $19..kinda pricey for M&amp;C which included Fresh lobster pieces, pea pods &amp; toasted pretzel roll crumbs...sans cherry tomatoes..
Friend ordered the lunch special (5.3 oz) Motorhead w/fries...$10.

M&amp;C came out pretty quick and served hot!  This was pretty fantastic...elbow noodles were cooked perfectly al dente!  Star for that alone...
Cheese was stringy and creamy at the same time. great flavor..not over powering..
Disappointed in the TINY lobster pieces..you had to fish for it...pea pods were crisp and added a nice texture....We both LOVED this....and could have finished the heaping dish, but needed
room for our burgers....was it worth $19?  No.

Upon boxing our Mac, we waited a good 20 min if not more for our burgers...
My heffer arrives and I can&#39;t wait to dive in....I taste the waffle strip first...the maple sweetness was there; a waffle in thin form....I noticed my pretzel bun was hard on one side and not warm....I just wanted to get this bad boy in my mouth...and let me tell you, this was not an easy task ...This puppy was piled high.  I managed to get a small bite after cutting burger in half.  Fries were barely warm, but semi-crisp and a good amount.

Burger was cooked to a perfect &#39;Medium&#39; as ordered.  Very pink center. Few more small bites and I noticed nothing in/on this burger tasted warm.  I then touched the chicken and center of burger and both felt cool to the touch.  Needless to say this really turned me off..
I was reluctant to eat more &amp; questioned whether it was properly cooked..  

Initially, our waitress came by right after she dropped off our plates to ask how everything was, but at that point I hadn&#39;t yet taken a bite.  I commented to my friend about my cold burger and she replied that her&#39;s was not warm either, and her bun not soft....When the waitress stopped by again, I asked if the burgers had been sitting because they weren&#39;t hot or warm AT ALL.  She replied they had not.  I asked if the burgers are usually served hot or warm, and she firmly stated &#34;They are always served hot.&#34;  I expressed my burger temperature &amp; dissatisfaction...Now, this is the part where it gets dicey...
She didn&#39;t offer to take my plate right away, she half-heartedly apologized, then finally asked if I wanted to speak to the manager..Yes, yes I do...At that moment, the whole scenario became awkward &amp; unbecoming..

She returns to tell us the Manager is on the phone and can&#39;t speak to us, but that if I want, they can make a new burger.  My friend already had her fill and ate a little more than half...didn&#39;t want the rest...I told her I wasn&#39;t interested in a new burger.  I had lost my appetite and there was no sense in making a new one only for me to bring home and have it sit in my fridge? Another 20 min. &amp; still no manager...

She then tells us she is sorry, offers NO other recourse and says she &#34;Hopes we have a better experience next time&#34;. Are you kidding me??  How bout THIS TIME? 
No PARTIAL credit off the bill?  No discount for a &#39;next time&#39;? And you think I&#39;d come back?
This was so poorly handled..
Hope she gets a better tip..next time.

$50 tab (pre-tip) with NO drinks..water only.  Overpriced (city prices) &amp; shitty customer service...
Thanks, but no thanks..
To add insult to injury...later that day, I felt utterly nauseous..it was all I ate in 24 hrs."

All the play is hard rock/metal music. I think it was Metallica night when I came because that&#39;s what they were playing when I was there. 

The service was really good. We came here around 9pm so no wait and barley anyone there. Our server knew the menu very well and offered to give her suggestions while we were deciding what to order. They&#39;ve a great beer selection and they also hard liquor as well. 

We ordered the Calamari which was really good. I loved that they fried the cherry peppers as well. The aioli sauce that comes with the calamari compliments very well with the dish.

I ordered the create your own mac n cheese. I choose Bacon and peas. The portion is huge and I couldn&#39;t finish half of it. The mac n cheese was very tasty and cheesy. I loved the dish and would order it again. 

If you go there dry the Blueberry Stout beer. One of my favorites!"

If you&#39;re a fan of great burgers, huge selection of beer and rock music, this is the place for you.  Even if you&#39;re a fan of just one of those items, I&#39;d recommend Kuma&#39;s anyway.

The plague bringer didn&#39;t sound as adventurous as some of the other burgers, but I&#39;m glad I stuck with my gut because I&#39;m such a spice and garlic lover.  You will leave smelling like garlic but it&#39;s worth it!  Although grilled jalapenos always taste great, I&#39;m glad Kuma&#39;s decided to use raw jalapenos as it gives it more of a kick.  The fries are seasoned perfectly, but weren&#39;t as crunchy as I would have liked.  The other reason why this place wasn&#39;t a perfect 5 is the bun.  I know you have to have something substantial to withstand the massive, perfectly cooked patty and toppings, but I found it to be a little too doughy for me.  Plus, my bun felt cold.  I would have liked it to be grilled or toasted for a few seconds.  

Ending on 2 positive notes.  1-The service was on point.  Even though the place was packed, I didn&#39;t feel rushed and the waitstaff/bartenders were all great!  2-I absolutely love fried pickles and this place&#39;s pickles were the best I&#39;ve had in Chicago thus far.  Thicker sliced, medium breading and not too salty.  Try it!"

I used to live in the city, I once tried to go to kuma&#39;s, but hated that line and the dingy darkness and the loudness blasting heavy metal and I never did get my burger as a result.   So for over ten years I have waited and YES! I have finally arrived!

So the wait still is present but its like just across from woodfield, so I could do a little shopping while I wait my 45-60mins just during lunch hour.  Wow, its still quite loud.   For my understanding of suburban tastes they probably could have saved some cash on the investment.  

But on to the food. It&#39;s LEGIT! These burgers are good!  had the &#34;slayer&#34; which is a bunless burger on a serious bed of fries ideal for gorging for one or a filling meal for two.  Ita a flavorful patty, I think chili cooked in beer.  That made me very happy."

I&#39;ve been to the original Kumas which we all have to agree is outstanding so I was a little worried as to how this one was going to measure up, but it did okay to tell you the truth. I came on a Sunday afternoon to meet up with a girlfriend of mine and it wasn&#39;t overly crowded. Inside again, is a little crazy for me with the super loud music. I&#39;m not hating on it, it&#39;s just not for me. I come for the food. But I do like their little outdoor patio on the days when it&#39;s not scorching hot. Our server was super friendly and attentive and I of course had to start with their legendary mac and cheese which is seriously enough for 4 people to share so the 2 of us couldn&#39;t finish it up even though it really is one of the best mac and cheeses on the planet. We did it with proccioto and sundried tomatoes which may be the best combo Kumas can come up with. They also put scallions on top for that extra crunch and green. 

All their burgers are unique and tasty, we got the one with cherry peppers and chipotle mayo and again, huge portion easy enough to share. The fries were good too even though I&#39;m still hoping they bring back the waffle fries because those are better. Sorry, Kumas, that&#39;s just the truth. Overall, the place is good, fairly priced for how much food you get and everything was super delicious. If you get your own burger, and you&#39;re a girl who can&#39;t eat a pound of food at a time, you will probably have leftovers so it&#39;s definitely a good place to share.

Definitely nice that they made a Kumas closer to home!"

What is good about all the Kuma&#39;s locations that I&#39;ve visited is that the meat is high quality. Whether it&#39;s the beef patty, chicken, or pork -- it&#39;s always tasty, cooked well, and prepared consistently. In this location, the saltiness does seem to be toned down a little, which I like -- consistently across all dishes. The pretzel bun is always fresh with a nice fluffy texture.

My only real issue is that the sauces, condiments, peppers, onions, and other different components that can be added into the burger really don&#39;t do much to create a memorable flavor. In fact, sometimes these really detract from enjoying the quality of the nicely cooked patty. With that said though, the flavor combinations in the sandwiches are still enjoyable and do pair well with the fries or chips (which are also a little on the light side for flavor).

If you haven&#39;t their Mac &amp; Cheese yet, make sure you do. Slightly firm pasta with a nice creamy cheese sauce, green onions, toasted bread crumbs, and your choice of toppings. A really nice, warm meal for the cold Chicago weather.

Overall, good food but not very memorable for how high ranked this restaurant is on most burger lists for Chicago."

I don&#39;t think anyone brings kids to the Kuma&#39;s in the city but at this location, people from all walks of life are here despite the loss heavy metal music blaring from the speakers and projected on the wall.

The wait is long but you can put your name down and you&#39;ll be texted when your table is ready. My party of 8 got a table in 45 minutes. Good thing you can walk around the other stores in the plaza to pass the time! Starbucks is right next door too. 

I ordered the slayer burger which is their 10 oz patty sitting on a bed of their fries and chili. Andouille sausage too!! This is a massive plate sans bun, but be warned... this is a highly salty meal. 

I preferred the original Kuma burger since the  pretzel bun adds a little sweetness to balance out the burger. I highly recommend the Mac n Cheese which can be ordered with your choice of two toppings like prosciutto and bacon. It&#39;s not cheap but definitely can be shared between two to three people depending on your appetite!

I enjoyed my Kuma&#39;s experience but in the end, I&#39;m an Au Cheval guy. Either one is a winner but that&#39;s just my preference. Find yours and enjoy!"

I went here after work with some coworkers. The menu is a little overwhelming with the amount of micro brews they have and their different variations of cheeseburger. 

Our server was great. She made recommendations for beers based on what our personal taste was and when ordering dinner she made multiple warnings about ingredients on the burger which actual help one of the guys change his order. 

The music was not that loud. I had read all the reviews prior to going and had braced myself for the worst. You can have a normal conversion with people at your table with no problem. 

Most of their burgers come on a very taste pretzel roll. One of the guys ordered the Slayer and it was a mountain of food (no bun), so if you order that be prepared. I had the Mastodon which is a BBQ Bacon burger. It was so good. There is a lot of flavor in the beef and they didn&#39;t over do it with the BBQ sauce. 

They have a burger that they put chicken and waffles on that won a national award for last year"

It&#39;s nicer to go to this location because it is family friendly. All the servers and hostess staff were really nice. The menu is the same as the Logan Square location. They still have a traditional line out the door with  1 hour way. But that&#39;s okay because you can walk around to browse at other stores while you wait.

We got seated in less than 1 hour, and had a table of about 8 people. Two of them being toddlers the other two were older kids. Kuma&#39;s corner music is blasting heavy metal rock music, which is something you come to accept and deal with because well it&#39;s Kuma&#39;s corner.

We ordered the traditional Kuma&#39;s burger, their lovely macaroni and cheese with broccoli and chicken, and my husband ordered the Slayer.

The Kuma&#39;s burger was perfect cooked to a nice medium rare just the way I like it. The Slayer looked like a burger that was killed twice over. It had chili and some spicy sausage it sat on top of piles of french fries. It was an interesting burger with a chili burger flavor. It was good! Of course we love their macaroni and cheese it is amazing with all the cheesy and we enjoyed it.

We like the food which is why we go to Kuma&#39;s corner we probably can do without the loud music. But that&#39;s how the restaurant is run with a loud atmosphere and that&#39;s fine. It just proves to people that their food is that great to go there even if the music doesn&#39;t suit us."

I walked in to death metal music video and thought &#34;Hey man, this isn&#39;t my scene&#34;. But I wanted to see their beer list and was blown away at how much awesome craft beer that the had. The place was packed but I found a spot at the bar and had to be picky in what beer&#39;s I was going to try as I had driven over and had to drive back to my hotel.  

I was able to try one of DESTIHL&#39;s sour beer series &#34;Counter Clockweisse&#34;. It was tangy, sour, and mouthwatering. I knew this was going to be both good and bad that I was able to try some great beers but not able to try them all. 

I figured if I was going to have another beer I should put my some food in my stomach to help. I went with the Plague burger, it was a burger that should only be consumed if you are fighting vampires or plan on not making out with anyone as it will contain a ton of garlic. Towards the end of eating it, it became as Lucille Bluth would describe &#34;one hot mess&#34;. It was good just falling apart everywhere.

I think this is a pretty good spot to. My only issue is the death metal music which quickly starts to bother my ears after 20 minutes or so, maybe due to that fact that I am getting older but you really should check it out!"

There&#39;s no stopping them - they are the true insane cutthroat gangstas of the burger realm.  Why would you ever want to get a burger from another joint when you can come to Kuma&#39;s (whether you&#39;re in city center or chilling in the burbs) and indulge in the most decadent of burgers?  The burgers here at this location are just as fantastic as they are at the original location in the city, but I&#39;d figured just as much.  Something as good as Kuma&#39;s wouldn&#39;t let location get in the way of the quality food it&#39;s serving.

When eating at the Belmont location I&#39;d ordered the Lair of Minotaur burger which totally rocked my socks so for an equally mind-blowing experience at this newest location I ordered the Plague Bringer, which if anything brought some serious heat...but only if you bit into the jalapeños on the burger...which I did and soon regretted afterwards.  Without the jalapeños the burger was phenomenal!  I could have sworn the patty here was even bigger than it was at the original location but that could easily be attributed to my mind playing tricks on me since I haven&#39;t eaten at Kuma&#39;s for a long while.  Be aware that this burger is totally laced in garlic and however good it may be your mouth will taste like garlic cologne for the next 12+ hours.  

Not only does his location have the Plague Bringer but it also has all of the same burgers thay you&#39;ve come to know and love from the other locations.  However, at this Kuma&#39;s Corner they do have a much more extensive draft selection, many of which are from local and much smaller breweries than some of is heard  of.    What&#39;s also interesting is that the bar area was made to look like a concert set-up  with its chromed out pavillion-style light suspenders.  The lights that  were flashing around the bar did seem to come at a cost of de-authenticating the grunge feel of this supposed-to-be  metal bar, but the experience was enjoyable all the same.  

Although I&#39;m still a sucker for the original location and it&#39;s coziness it was nice that this location offered such a large space which prevents people from waiting as long as they otherwise would.  I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m a sadistic creature and like waiting in lines forever, but the original location is what it is - perfection.  The waiters were all perfectly friendly as well!  

Just a sidenote, though: if you want to order alcohol here they&#39;ll ask you for two forms of identification due to some Schaumburg ordinance apparently.  So even if you&#39;re paying with cash it&#39;s advisable to bring your ID and credit card because they can use both to confirm.  Weird, I know.  

This location definitely strived  to achieve the same feel of the Belmont location and although it came close it&#39;s not exactly the same.  Despite this, the food is just as good as ever and you won&#39;t be let down in the least bit by what you sink your teeth into.  

This puma&#39;s over and out so you best get your butt to this new and ever-amazing Kuma&#39;s."

The latest incarnation of this west Belmont institution finds it in Schaumburg. I hope this location isn&#39;t cursed because this is where Schlotzsky&#39;s withered and died.

What&#39;s nice about the location is there is a patio where you can catch some sun if you&#39;re not up for the dark bar vibe in the restaurant itself.

It&#39;s still Kuma&#39;s. The staff is hipster and with tattoos, beards and piercings, but this is the suburbs so there&#39;s no crust around their dreadlocks, and their personality is more like a cheerleader. I can live with that.

The menu is a transplant from the original with many popular picks like Neurosis and High on Fire. The burgers are very high quality meat on a delicious pretzel roll. The fixin&#39;s are pure fantasy with everything from sriracha mayo to bacon wrapped dates on them. You can get them with their fries or their to-die-for house made potato chips. I always pick those, and I tend to eat them before I take my first bite of burger. If you&#39;re beef phobic, they have a high quality bison burger which is a leaner cut for $4 more. The burgers are 10 ounces and range about $14-$15. I had to cut mine in half. If you&#39;re more modest in your appetite, I suggest getting a lower priced weekday special burger for about $8 with less meat. 

I ordered a medium rare High on Fire, and it unfortunately came out blue. As I mentioned, I had eaten most of the chips when I noticed that my burger was underdone. &#34;No problem!&#34; said the waiter and they made me a completely new plate, perferctly done, with a fresh stack of chips. I ate those as well. Yay!

The beer selection includes a surprising variety from local microbreweries. Some I didn&#39;t even know existed. It was nice to see that our burbs are supporting many new local craft beers. My only beef was that most of the selections were on the hoppy side, even the pilsners and lagers. I prefer Belgian ales as well, and the one they had on tap was smoked with mezcal in it-- honestly a little far afield from my standard choice.

With tax and tip, the two of us had two burgers and four beers which came to $80. There&#39;s a price only a hedge fund manager could love! After I left, I found out that this bar had whiskey on tap. Maybe a couple of shots of bourbon would have numbed the shock of that burger and brew tab."

We arrived right at the time they were opening which was perfect. No wait and was seated right away. 

I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t order the right thing. I chose the mac and cheese. Some ingredients I  ordered were missing and we told our server. The manager was kind enough to bring me out the correct order. I found the mac and cheese to be way overpowering and very rich. I brought home both orders of mac and cheese that wound up going in the garbage uneaten.

My husband encouraged me to order a burger and of course I didn&#39;t listen. I had a bite of his special burger called the Howler. It had slices of brisket in it. The burger tasted delicious and I knew right then and there I made the wrong decision with my order.

The joint is very loud when you walk with heavy mental music which makes it difficult to hear one another.

Our server was very friendly... Maybe a bit too talkative, but very attentive.  She gave great selections for beer as some in our group wanted fruitier beer or the closest thing to Miller Lite.  They just serve beer for alcohol, but have an excellent selection of craft beer from all over.

The in-laws ordered The Black Sabbath and the Goatsnake - they both took home leftovers and we&#39;re happy with the taste.  My wife is a vegetarian and went with their Mac and cheese, which she said was just &#34;okay.&#34;  I ordered the Hatebeak, which is a spicy chicken sandwich, but I was underwhelmed.

I&#39;ve been to the Kuma&#39;s locations in the city and in terms of the food quality, this one is just as good. At 4:45 on a Saturday, my friend and I had to wait a half hour for a table. I liked they had special burgers, including a Jamaican themed one with some unusal toppings like fried plantains and marinated flank steak. That&#39;s right...flank steak on a burger. God bless America.

I went with the Neurosis: horseradish mayo, sharp cheddar, swiss, caramelized onion, sauteed mushroom..and I addded bacon. The burger was cooked medium, as I asked and the fries were fresh cut.  The bacon could have been done a little more though, it was just too chewy. 

The beer lists are posted on monitors above the bar, which is cool since they can update them as they need to. This place is going to be crowded and loud with rock and roll music, so if you&#39;re looking for a quiet place to have a conversation, look somewhere else."

One Saturday night, we wanted burgers and I had just read Aimee&#39;s review on this location, so off we headed. With only two of us, it was pretty easy to get a table. No wait. Score! This is seriously the best part considering you usually have to wait an hour + at the Belmont location.

The menu is the same as the original. For an appetizer we got the fried pickles. For dinner, I went with the Absu (my ABSUlute favorite - get it? HA) - tomatillo salas, pepperjack, avocado, queso fresco and fried peppers. My boyfriend went with the Lair of the Minotaur - caramelized onion, pancetta, brie and bourbon poached pear. Welcome to Yumtown! lol that was pretty cheesy.

Their burgers are still huge and delightful. We got a few beers each since there are so many to chose from.  

I don&#39;t know what people expect from Kuma&#39;s and why I see so many negative reviews. I am never disappointed when I go to the one on Belmont and I was not disappointed at this location either. Yes they play loud heavy metal music, and no it&#39;s not very kid friendly, but I go for the f&#39;n burgers and brewskies, nothing else. 

The only thing I didn&#39;t like, was the sun blasting our faces off because they have no shades. Might want to work on that Kuma&#39;s. But, that doesn&#39;t take away from the food OR beer.

4 for beer and service/ 3ish for the burger
 
August 13, lunch. 

Solid four for service and knowledge of beers on hand. Every taste our guy brought me was as good or better than the last. Loved it. Wish they offered a flight, but that&#39;s the beer nerd in me wanting to try anything I can&#39;t get at home. Their colab IPA was stunning, as well as the Arcade Dbl Grapefruit. 

On to the food. (And mind you some of this is really nit picky. )

Fried pickles were good. Super crispy breading (panko maybe) nice pickle inside but it didn&#39;t have a pop of flavor. Decent but not mind blowing. 

Chicken tenders where almost perfect. Great buffalo sauce, good size, nice flavor, juicy but an inch into over cooked. Would still get them again. 

Plague burger. Huge, good pretzel bun, garlic that will make me stink for days, perfectly cook...but the burger itself lacked a bit of flavor. Maybe they use a low fat mix or do not season. Would have liked more of a char on the meat. It was overall ok. I have had better, but by far not the worst. 

Fries. Love the idea of fresh cut but these were off. Texture was different and I am not sure how to describe it. I want to say rubbery, but that is not entirely true. Maybe they had been reheated, I don&#39;t know. Maybe it is the type of tater they use. Certainly better than frozen. 

Other really small things that no one else would bitch about accept a prick like me. 
Napkins where washed with a scented detergent that lingered after I wiped my hands or mouth on it. Tainted the smells and tastes of what I was eating and drinking. 
Also, beer glasses, both the taster size and the glassware the beer was served in, still had a detergent/bleach smell. It only lingered briefly, but it was enough that I could smell it. Again not something I want to interfere with what the staff and chef are serving me. 

I know this not a very metal review, but f you ;)  

Still a cool joint in a strip mall. Would hit it again and I would recommend."

I&#39;d rather parallel park my in a teeny tiny spot behind a cop car, across your original location on Belmont, with tons of cars waiting behind me honking like crazy, with the cop standing there waiting for me to hit his squad car than deal with the crazy people parking in this mall lot...but that&#39;s just me. 

But here I was in Schaumburg, hoping that the wait wouldn&#39;t be as nuts as your original location.  And gloriously, the trio of us were seated immediately, Saturday at 530pm.  But shortly after that, the wait grew to an hour quickly. 

The atmosphere is like a sleek rock bar. The music is loud. Hard to have a conversation kind  of loud. I was really surprised to see a diaper changing station in the bathroom because I would never take a baby here---it&#39;s just too loud.  I would even have to think twice about taking my son here because of the volume, unless they can seat us on the patio. 

Glad to see that the menu is the same as the original location because the jalapeno poppers are awesome.  The filling flavorful and cheesy and the raspberry dipping sauce is the perfect accompaniment for it. 

My burger--the Goatsnake--looked amazing, it was a little more red than I am used to for a Medium, but it was very good and the flavors were delicious--atop the beef patty, there is herbed goat cheese, poblano corn relish, lemon vinaigrette and frizzled onions.  It was a huge burger and I was able to only finish half.  Yay for leftovers!

The craft beer list is great...I just wish the pint glass I was given for my beer wasn&#39;t fresh-out-of-the-dishwasher-warm...yuck. 

Service was great...our server (not the person that gave me my beer) was a lot of fun, friendly and helpful."

The new place has a nice decorating scheme, with rock show light metallic structures around the bar and elsewhere. Nice band posters abound, a video screen was playing Black Sabbath &#34;videos&#34; from ~1973 when we were there, and the specialty burgers can be had, without the long waits of the original location. 

My son and I enjoyed our visit, but weren&#39;t wowed by our burgers. But I always like that trying something different, but haven&#39;t found my Kuma&#39;s &#34;go to&#34; just yet. Service here is great, and since we got here before the Noon lunch rush, there wasn&#39;t much of a wait to be seated, or for our food. I would definitely come back."

I plowed through a Pantera burger. The burger was cooked perfectly to my order, and the pretzel bun was soft and salty. What really set it apart was the service was exceptional. My sister and I ate with my three-year-old daughter, and the staff went above and beyond to make her comfortable and have a good time. From the hostess getting us a booth with extra elbow room, fun play and interaction from our server (and several other of the servers, too), and a friendly cook that really made her day. Between orders, the cook would make friendly faces, and even brought her a sticker. (Which she loved.) I was a bit put off initially with the loud metal music, dressed in a tie-die and sandals, but I quickly learned that though it may look and sound rough, it&#39;s a family place, after all. 
Also, I don&#39;t drink, but the beer list was huuuge!"

The music was super loud and it was difficult to talk to the people I went with. Other than that the food was okay. I got the slayer and it was difficult to eat it all. So much fries but I guess it makes up for no buns. the meat didn&#39;t taste that well, had no flavor. 

The customer service was amazing, never had to ask for a refill, they were attentive and super nice. Would definitely go back to try new things there"

I didn&#39;t like the food at the city location, and so many people suggested I try it and so I decided to try the Schaumburg location. And the second time around, I was still not impressed. I can&#39;t remember what I got the first time around, but the second time I got the &#34;Kuma burger&#34; (don&#39;t remember the actual name of it, but basically their house burger). Both occasions, I remember the burgers being super dry. The meat didn&#39;t have any flavor and wasn&#39;t very juicy. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the fries either - I think the oil must have been old and their wasn&#39;t enough salt on them. Honestly, I think Kuma&#39;s is overrated and you can find a better burger elsewhere."

Lived about 3 blocks from the original Kumas and fell in love with the joint day one. Metalheads tattoos and big ass burgers.... What more could you ask for? I loved the environment of the original and was there a minimum of twice a week. 

I have been in the suburbs for the past 5 years... My Kumas trips went down dramatically... Once every few months. I was beyond excited about this location opening, close to home, same food win win!!! Right? .....wrong...

The food still is great, the the burgers just as good as the original location... The difference is this Kumas has more kids and let&#39;s be honest more snobs.. I have been here a lot of times....and the atmosphere is just crap.... It&#39;s not the music because I am a metalhead and couldn&#39;t be happier to eat a burger and hear Slayer at the same time.

What I don&#39;t like is the fact that I go in and see 20 kids..snobby people that look at you cross eyed when they see your tattoos...it&#39;s as if they have no idea what they are walking in to. I actually had a couple next to me one night complain about the music......seriously....

Definitely go here for the food... Just put your blinders on to ignore the other crap."

Sounds awesome- except the place is full of squares who gawk and whisper when real metal heads walk in. Total waste of time if you&#39;re looking for a place to hang out and drink with other metal heads. I suppose the underground death and black metal scene are just another novelty to exploit. 

Had a beer and no food. Perhaps the food is good, but the atmosphere is absolute shit. If I want to try it, I&#39;ll do take out. Unless I get a group of 20 - 30 metal heads to turn this place on its ass! 

Perhaps the creator of this mini chain meant well, but it certainly reeks of the Modern Day parasitic mall culture making a mockery of any sub culture worth a damn. 

I&#39;ll buy my beer from a distributor and hang out with my friends and a BBQ, while spinning Mortuary Drape LPs. I don&#39;t need a faulty establishment in some crummy suburb full of self entitled plebs."

To my dismay, I wasn&#39;t too pleased with this visit. I came here for lunch and was seated right away so I can&#39;t really complain about waiting. They were packed though! I can imagine this place at night. And compared to the one in the city, no wait is a super +++! 

Burger: well next time I will order medium. I got medium well and it was way dry to the point where the burger was almost tasteless. Wish the bacon was crispy too but those are all easy fix I guess, next time ask for extra crispy bacon and medium cooked burger. The burger came with chips and those were super good! 

Fries with pulled pork bbq:  it was ok, wish it had more bbq sauce drenched in it but you can always add that on, no biggie. I wasn&#39;t crazy about the quality of the pork  could be better. 

Another beef of mine is that the music was way too loud  . 

I will try again because their burgers are amazing. I might have just been having an off taste kinda day."

Because there simply aren&#39;t any other visits! OK, time to review!

I opted to sit at the bar - I was there on a Tuesday afternoon around 1PM and there were a fair number of people dining. The bartender greeted me promptly and I began to peruse the menu. I have this tendency to leave my reading glasses in the car and was too lazy to go back out in the cold to get them, so my burger choice was somewhat &#34;blind&#34;.  The easiest cut to the chase item burger-wise on the menu appeared to be the &#34;Wasp&#34; - a 6oz lunch burger with cheddar cheese and carmelized onions. I went with that and a Sprecher Root Beer. When I went to order the burger, I ordered it my usual medium rare, but came to find out that the lunch offerings are only cooked in three temperatures; rare, medium and well. So rare it was!

Now, the downside with a rare burger is that between the softness of the meat combined with the juiciness of the burger itself, it can make for a mushy meal overall. By the time I was down to my last few bites, the object I was eating was unidentifiable. And with the juices flowing, I had to wipe my chin every now and then with the awkwardly think cloth napkin that comes with the silverware inside.

Now, while it sounds like all I&#39;m doing is complaining, I will say that taste-wise, it was a darn good burger. Got the homemade chips with it - a few more would have been nice, but one thing that I loved about them was that they weren&#39;t full of salt like a lot of homemade chips can be. And throughout my visit, the bartender was helpful, friendly and talkative.

Final verdict - good food, good times. I&#39;ll be back at this location."
kumas-corner-schaumburg-schaumburg,Mike M.,W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,108,12,6w3EEXgs1xwtQvTzbVC-vQ,3.0,2015-08-10,"With so many great restaurants in Chicago that exclusively have locations in the city, I was excited to see the burbs were finally gettin a piece of the action. As expected, I saw a bunch of mixed reviews when they first opened. I remember when Kuma&#39;s Too first opened up I saw some of the purists say that it just quite wasn&#39;t the same...that it was missing that divey atmosphere and that the brand new equipment was lacking the years of built up seasoning and character. Kuma&#39;s Schaumburg skeptics took it even further, with some saying that the music selection and volume have been toned down to cater to more of the suburban family crowd.

While I&#39;m sure the atmosphere is the main draw for some people, as long as the food is just as good I&#39;m a happy camper. The menu was exactly the same, so I was eager to put it to the test and try it myself. I&#39;ve been to the original Kuma&#39;s a couple times a while back, but I wasn&#39;t sure if I just got sucked into the hype at the time or if it really did stand out as one of the best burgers in Chicago. 

Food: I absolutely loved the vibe of their menu: over the top burgers that each had at least 2 types of meat in it. It&#39;s a celebration of everything greasy and fatty...hell yea. They also had some solid mac and cheese and an extensive beer list. 

Fried pickles - Not a huge pickles fan, but deep frying makes everything taste good. The sauce it came with was really tasty too, creamy with a good kick.

Mac and cheese - The mac and cheese is seriously the biggest sleeper on the entire menu. The burgers get all the glory but the mac and cheese here is legit. Two toppings are included but you can load it up with whatever else you want too. We went with bacon, garlic, sun dried tomatoes, and andouille sausage. The cheese sauce wasn&#39;t too creamy or overpowering and the toppings were straight up delicious. How could a meat lovers mac and cheese not be good? Also, finally a place that doesn&#39;t skimp on the garlic. The flavor definitely came through. Some of the best mac and cheese I&#39;ve had.

Godhammered burger - This was their burger of the month. It pretty much had the most meats out of anything else on the menu, so I def had to get it. The burger consisted of a 10 oz burger patty, pulled pork as a topping, candied bacon, jalapeno slaw, and fried onion strings. Just ridiculous. 

The burger patty was cooked perfectly, and was super juicy and seasoned well. The pulled pork was pretty dry and didn&#39;t have too much flavor outside of just plain pork. The candied bacon was fantastic, sweet and salty at its finest. It had an awesome crunch and decent amount of fat too. Obviously the frizzled onions were tasty. You can never lose with those as a topping. The slaw was creamy and gave a little bit of spice to the burger. The pretzel bun was a big disappointment. It was cold and not soft at all. I would&#39;ve preferred it more toasted with a slightly crunchy outside and warm and soft center. Overall, not a bad burger, but definitely not head and shoulders above some of the other burgers I&#39;ve eaten.


Service: I&#39;ll be honest, the service was pretty terrible while we were here. From the minute we sat down, our server was pretty damn slow the entire night. There were just periods of time when he couldn&#39;t be found. 

After ordering, we&#39;re pretty sure there was a mix up and they delivered our appetizer to the wrong table. When we asked our server about our missing app, he just shrugged his shoulders and claimed he put the order in. The hell? You could&#39;ve at least said you&#39;d check to see what happened. He obviously didn&#39;t care. 

Then a long ass time passed by and we got all our food at once: the burgers, the mac and cheese, and the missing appetizer. It kinda defeated the purpose of the appetizer since we were hungry as hell that entire time and now we had more food than could fit on the table. 

When our server checked up on us he acted all surprised and even made up some bs remark saying oh look at that, the burgers must&#39;ve been cooked really quick because it came out at the same time as your app. Cmon man, it&#39;s obvious you just put the order in again and they only fried those suckers up a few minutes ago. His nonchalance was bordering straight up laziness and apathy.

Overall, Kuma&#39;s in Schaumburg wouldn&#39;t be one of the places I&#39;d be running to the next time I&#39;m in the area. I&#39;m sure our crappy service could very well have been an isolated incident, but even just judging purely on food it didn&#39;t live up to the hype and doesn&#39;t justify the long wait, in my opinion. I do love their creative menu and always changing BOTM, but I still prefer other burgers in the burbs like at DMK or Tracks."

While checking out at Trader Joe&#39;s next door, the cashier recommended Kuma&#39;s as the best place around to eat. We looked at the reviews for it on Yelp and *almost* decided against it. But we thought the idea of metal music and awesome burgers was too good to pass up!  We are so glad we came! We got a cozy booth and great, attentive service from our blue-haired waitress. (Can&#39;t remember her name but she was fantastic and made the experience even more fun). The music and television shows playing added to the fun atmosphere. 
The dude at Trader Joe&#39;s had told us the portions were huge so my daughter and I decided to split a burger. We got the Yob burger and it was tasty.  Couldn&#39;t decide between the fries or chips so we got both- and so glad we did!  They were both delicious.  The one burger and two sides were PLENTY for us (although wouldn&#39;t have been enough for my husband and son). 
The service and food were on point. My only issue was the prices seemed a bit high. Our burger was $15 and I thought it included a side but we were charged for both the fries and chips. I&#39;d definitely come back next time we are in the area though and recommend it to anyone else."

I ordered the black sabbath and I think that might be the smallest burger they have. These burgers are no joke. They come in a big boy pretzel bun with a very thick patty and tons of chips/fries. They also have a ton of unique craft beers and the ambiance was almost pleasant with heavy metal in the background instead of acoustic music at a coffeehouse. Not a light meal for sure but will definitely be back to try some of the other burgers!

Way to bring some of the city flavor over to the burbs, Kuma! 

First thoughts about the ambiance: a happy marriage of trendy hipster + heavy metal. There&#39;s loud heavy metal / rock music playing with the corresponding music video playing on all the TV screens. We happened to go for a weekday lunch and the weather was REALLY nice, so there were no spots on the patio. We didn&#39;t have the luxury to wait (my boo had to get back to work), so we just accepted our booth seats indoors. I&#39;ll definitely have to get a seat on the patio next time. It&#39;s just such a waste not to enjoy the beautiful weather while you can here.

The Burger of the Month was called Godhammered: 10 oz. beef patty, sharp cheddar, Seattle cider braised pulled pork, honey whiskey candied bacon, jalapeno slaw, and frizzled onions. You can get salad, chips or fries. We got chips with this one. 

We also ordered the lunch sized version of the Plague Bringer Burger: roasted garlic mayo, crushed garlic, housemade hot sauce, jalapenos, tortilla strips, lettuce, tomato and onions. We got the fries with this one. Ask for chipotle mayo as an additional dipping sauce. We alternated between dipping into ketchup and the mayo. I do so love my variety of sauces.

The Plague Bringer Burger was better, in my opinion. I loved the crunch of the tortilla strips, and the balance of the savory beef and sauces with the crisp lettuce and tomato together. I can&#39;t wait to try the one in the city to compare. 

I&#39;ve also heard that the build your own mac n cheese is pretty awesome, but I&#39;ll have to order that if I come with a larger group. I saw a plate of that at the table next to us, and it just seemed like it was too much for two people."

Jalapeno poppers with a jelly are absolutely delicious and not very hot. Both of the burgers we ordered our ginormous in too big for one person to eat. The fresh cut fries are amazing. Will definitely come back here again!

Well then this is the place for you. This metal theme restaurant has amazing food and caters forgoes who love Metallica, Slayer and Pantera (they have burgers named after these bands). 

I had the Slayer which was basically a burger patty on a pile of fries covered with chili, cheese and sausages. This was very yummy but spicy. I even tried a friends order of Mac and Cheese which was also amazing and cheesy. You can choose your own combination of extra ingredients for the Mac and cheese.

Now if you love heavy metal you will love the atmosphere. They play metal music very loudly. So unless you enjoy a loud noisy eating experience you might wanna avoid this place. But then again if you don&#39;t like metal you probably wouldn&#39;t be drawn to it in the first place. 

So in conclusion: tasty greasy food and loud music.

Well I got an ear-full!  Kuma&#39;s is a burger place, but upscale.  Yes they have chicken and pork too, but don&#39;t ask for any vegan options they don&#39;t have them and never will.  The burgers are 10oz and named for various metal bands.  So you have choices of the Iron Maiden, the Metalica or the Slayer.   The music is loud and while we were there we heard Ghost, Pantera, Black Sabbath, Megadeth and Metalica. 
The burgers were great. Huge, covered in great toppings and juicy.  The fries were also really good. I had the Mastodon but next time I want to try the Slayer.

So my husband&#39;s best friend works in the Schaumburg area eats there often and raves about it constantly, so last Sunday we decided to make the 45 minute drive from Aurora and let me tell you...it was worth the drive and we can&#39;t WAIT to go back this weekend!

We walked in about 30-45 minutes after opening and the place was SLAMMED already! This was a for sure sign that yummy adventures were ahead. We opted not to wait for a table and grabbed the last 2 open bar stools available. As busy as it was, the service at the bar was flawless! Can&#39;t remember names, but the guy with the hot wavy man bun, and the gal with beautiful shades of blue/green/turquoise hair streaks...they were on point. I mean, seriously... I&#39;ve worked in the industry and know how completely overwhelming it can get just 2 of you and a full bar top ordering not just drinks but full meals from start-to-finish, everybody.... But they were 100% on it. Super friendly. Super efficient. Super attentive. Can&#39;t say enough good things about the service. Now onto the food...

Apparently I live under a rock and had never heard of the Kuma&#39;s in the city (let alone burbs) but this place lives up to every dream you&#39;ve ever had about downing a phenomenal burger. And those other reviewers complaining about cost? Get outta here with your McD&#39;s budget and taste, BARF! No joke, most of our 45 minute drive was re-reading the menu and trying to figure out how the hell we were going to pick which burger to start with. Every single one sounded amazeballs.

We started with fried pickles (ps: I&#39;m from country-folk Tennessee where fried pickles are a favorite/staple and these were the best I&#39;d ever had.) They said the buttermilk batter is made fresh every day... talk about crisp and flavorful, I just about slid off my stool! haha! And the burgers?! Good LORD! I got &#34;The Goatsnake&#34; and my man got &#34;The Slayer&#34;. If we had moaned any louder at the ridiculousness of flavors, they probably would&#39;ve tossed us out on naughty suspicions! haha! And the beer selection is impressive... from tap to bottles. Afterall, nothing compliments a great burger like a great beer. Kuma&#39;s is just the total package.

One last note about the music.... Folks, it&#39;s a heavy metal themed pub. If you are very uncomfortable with that, and can&#39;t convince yourself to block out the tunes long enough to experience a CRAZY delicious meal, then don&#39;t go (you old farts)... I&#39;m 34 and grew up in a world where Metallica dominated radio and MTV (videos....remember those, MTV??) whether you liked it or not. I respect the heavy metal genre but it&#39;s not my favorite. But I also never cared for the Spice Girls either, but I&#39;d still sit through their songs if it mean&#39;t I got to eat a Kuma&#39;s burger anyhow, HANDS DOWN.

Our server was Bryan. And he was on top of his game. Very friendly and helped us out since it was our first time. The beer selection is stellar. The food was amazing. I am not really big on jalapeño poppers. But I read some raves on here about them and gave them a try. Amazing. 

The burger I had was the Sourvein. It has won some awards and I now know why. It was the best burger I&#39;ve ever had. Ever. I would strongly recommend this place. 

While I enjoyed the food and time spent here, there were some things I didn&#39;t like. They do not and will not have sports on the TV. So if you&#39;re looking for the game. Leave this place for another time. We streamed the hockey game on our phone at the table. So we were good haha. They also play really crappy music. The whole time we were there it sounded like one constant slayer song. Like heavy metal stuff. This isn&#39;t really my cup of tea. But I&#39;m not going to dock them any stars because the food and service made up for it."

My first visit was on a Friday night, and it was absolutely packed. We were lucky to find a spot at the bar, and admired the selection of beers that were available on draft. My boyfriend and I both love metal music, so we enjoyed the loudness of the place and the music videos they showed on their multiple TVs. On our first visit, our server was a bit impatient with us; she lingered while we decided what to order, and eventually she became impatient with me and said that she&#39;d surprise me. This was a bit off-putting, but she made the right choice! 

I had the Lair of the Minotaur burger - Brie cheese and pear - and there are no words as to how delicious it was. My boyfriend had the Mastodon, which he also loved.

Our second visit was on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was nearly empty, and our server was much better. I tried the Mac and cheese with sausage and peas and - oh. my. God. It was a heaping portion and it was to die for. I&#39;m a bit of a Mac and cheese snob, as it&#39;s my favorite food in the world, and it was on point! I was so happy to have leftovers.

Be prepared for a loud environment if you come here. We loved it, and will absolutely be returning."

Got there around 5:30pm and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. The place is small, so the wait was expected. They have a texting system and they&#39;ll send you a message when your table is ready.

The atmosphere is fun and extremely energetic. Lots of fast pounding metal music.

Once seated, our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. The beer list is long and good. I ordered the Led Zeppelin burger (bacon, pulled pork, BBQ sauce, cheddar). It was cooked perfectly all the way through, the fries were also delicious. The pretzel bun is a very nice touch.

Kuma&#39;s is definitely worth the trip and would highly recommend for a great tasting burger."

Last night after a bad movie with good company in the suburbs, we decided on Kuma&#39;s to satisfy everyone&#39;s taste. Beer menus often overwhelm me and the bloody mary sounded good so I ordered that. It was a fantastic mix that was very original! 

Our waitress tempted us with her mac and cheese special w bacon and scallops that made my mouth water but I just had to get the famous burger for my first visit. The meat was fluffy and flavorful and I love that every burger automatically has pretzel bun. This, my friends, was the best burger I&#39;ve ever had!

When I was a young, tattooed, pierced jerk who loved Booz and gore and lived fast and hard, I&#39;d come to the OG Kuma&#39;s in Avondale and get too drunk on Scrumpy&#39;s delicious cider while indulging in burgers and metal, blending in with the bad ass crowd, enduring the long waits for the amazing food and equally bangin&#39; street cred. 

Then life slowed down, my career picked up, I began covering up the tattoos more and more and taking on responsibilities like marriage, dogs, rent, car payments... You know, grown up sh*t. Gone were the days of wasting time at the bar, desperate for a table to open up with a good view of the horror movies blaring across the screens at the bar. So we moved on to Kuma&#39;s Lakeview. Larger, quieter, a more reasonable wait to match my more reasonable, logical lifestyle. We&#39;d politely walk past the well groomed businesses of almost-lincoln-park and drive home in our Nissan when it was over.

And now? Now we call Kuma&#39;s Schaumburg. We order pickup (who can be bothered to dine in at a restaurant after a tough day at the office?). We drive in our SUV to go pick it up. We tip the hostess. We eat in our living room. We go to bed at a reasonable hour. It&#39;s true. And it&#39;s sad.

What ISN&#39;T sad is that Kuma&#39;s amazingly delicious menu has been maintained throughout. The quality is dead on. The recipes are the same. The burgers are on point. The food is timeless. The staff is polite. All the things that made Kuma&#39;s famous and makes Kuma&#39;s great are here. I ordered a delicious Sleep burger (a November tradition), and chips, and everything was delicious and traveled well, hot, and neatly. The interior of this place is suburban and sterile and clean. It&#39;s comfortable for a restaurant, but admittedly odd for a Kuma&#39;s. But still... The burgers is why we began to come, and the burgers are why we keep coming back. Even to the suburbs.

I don&#39;t want to think of the next installation of Kuma&#39;s just yet. I fear I&#39;ll be sitting in a nursing home, wistfully staring out the window wishing the grandkids visited more, when my nice nurse will bring me a Pantera burger, neatly cut up to accommodate my dentures-filled mouth and frail hands. I&#39;ll wheel over to my husband, throw up some devil horns, and gum my burger blissfully. It&#39;s coming, I&#39;m sure... But I&#39;m not ready yet. So in the interim, a Schaumburg Kuma&#39;s doesn&#39;t sound so bad, and I will happily return."

I don&#39;t know what I expected that kept me from checking it out, but I&#39;m glad I finally went.  I looked through the food pictures before I went and the Led Zeppelin caught my eye, so that&#39;s what I ordered.  The people I went with ordered the mac &amp; cheese.  It was an insane amount of food for the price.  And one thing that really impressed me is this: the place was busy so we had to wait for a table, but once we sat down and ordered our food arrived quickly and almost too hot to eat.  It couldn&#39;t have been fresher!  The burger with pulled pork was delicious and their home made chips were a step above the norm.  The music was none I have in my player, but it was low enough volume-wise that it added kind of a background soundtrack for the place without making it difficult for us to easily carry on a conversation. There was also a varied selection of beers.  In general they&#39;ve just got everything right."

Shared a Slayer (a 10oz patty on top of chili fries, grilled onions, peppers, andouille sausage, and Monterey Jack cheese--No bun) and lunch special Kumar burger (the infamous burger on a pretzel bun with an over easy egg, as well as sharp cheddar, lettuce, onion, and tomato). 

The Kumar lunch special version is $10, versus the regular at $14. Not sure what the difference is between the two versions, other than the lunch special is only available in rare/medium/well done and not medium rare or medium well. Make sure that you specifically say that you want the lunch special. They charged us for the regular even though my sister pointed to the lunch menu when she ordered (they do have other burgers on the lunch menu, which is weekdays until 5pm). But they were super nice (and attentive) and changed the price for us. My sister was surprised how nice they were, considering that they are metalheads, speaking as a former metalhead.

Ok on to the food review. We were disappointed with the quality, despite the big portions, and made us miss In-N-Out. The Kumar was not warm, even the bun was cold. My sister ordered it medicine but it was bright red inside. The vegetables on the Kumar looked old. The Kumar was bland, while the Slayer was salty (I had a drink of water nearly after each bite. I liked the Slayer better, but of course it was mostly fries. Still a huge amount of food for the Slayer, so much so that it was hard to fit my leftovers in one box. The Slayer was a little spicy and had a decent amount of sausage. 

Came at 2pm on a Friday and no wait. Music is not my favorite but it&#39;s not as loud as I thought although it&#39;s still kind of loud, enough to worsen my headache, but not as loud as a concert. 

Glad it&#39;s wheelchair accessible unlike its famous Chicago location, so unfortunately, I can&#39;t compare the two locations. They have a parking lot in a strip mall (the same one as Nordstrom Rack and the Container Store, but it is closer to the street) with one wheelchair accessible parking space in the lot closest to them. There&#39;s more accessible parking in the strip mall at large. 

It&#39;s hard to see at first, but it&#39;s directly across from the California Pizza Kitchen. Look for a red bear in a window."

Nothing huge was wrong but I felt that it was quite an underwhelming experience.

The sound system was beyond awful; I am old enough to have attended live performances of many of the bands that were being shown on the TV&#39;s and can only conclude that Kuma&#39;s is using the crappy built in speakers in the TV rather than a separate amp/speaker system. At the very least- the system that they have isn&#39;t suited to the acoustics of the dining area/bar.

Service was slow if friendly early on a Sunday night where it didn&#39;t appear to otherwise be terribly busy. We might just have been unlucky enough to arrive at a shift change.

The beer list was extensive with many eclectic selections from small breweries in the area. The food seemed to be tempting but what we got was largely lukewarm/cold without much in the way of character or freshness. I seldom send food back but I was tempted to in this case- I didn&#39;t because it was a very late lunch for the two of us and to be honest I would have eaten just about anything at that point.

In spite of this location being open for going on 6 months now, the staff seemed disorganized and not in tune with their surroundings. It seemed to me that the bartenders seemed overly attentive/chatty to the waitresses who just got off their shift and were seated at the bar- this was at the expense of the customers at the bar who were trying all sort of ways to get attention and service.

The bottom line is I felt the concept of being an anti-&#34;Hard Rock Cafe&#34; is great, with the execution at this location being substandard."

The plus points: plenty of parking, nice bearded staff, nice seating-overall good look,. Know that I completely understand the death metal theme with the blaring music...cause you really shouldn&#39;t listen to it any other way---I mean it IS Death Metal---and the scary names of the burgers, we had the Embalmed and the Goatsnake. The noise just got annoying (sorry to the metalheads--guess I&#39;m a square) and maybe it was my fault for ordering the Goatsnake with the grilled chicken instead of the whopping , what looked like--a one pound beef patty. The goatsnake was described really well in the menu and the server said lots of people substitute chicken or other choices for beef but in all honesty---it was bland. My husband loved his Embalmed featuring pulled chicken in mole on it. I tasted it but wasnt impressed and his was a beef burger. Also there was a wierd movie on the big screen featuring dead bodies and other nasty stuff.  I will say the basil balsamic was AWESOME and the salad both in looks and freshness was just lovely!! They also offer Sriracha and Choloula sauce which is nice but no amount of sauce livened up my burger.  Everything else was noisy and bla. If you are into this be sure to give it one chance.

He only plus was Mac and cheese.  It really was amazing. But not worth $14 of amazing. 

My kid has the chicken strips and they were dry (and slightly burnt)

Pretty sure they just increased the price of everything making it not worth. 


Solid burgers lots of drinks. 

The fried pickles are great here. It&#39;s not heavy and not over fried to the point where you can&#39;t taste the pickle. 

I got their new burger of the month Godflesh. It had bacon wrapped dates, pickled onions, 2 year aged white cheddar, spicy malt aoli. Lots of flavor but it wasn&#39;t too consistent because my mouth couldn&#39;t handle all that grease and flavor at once. 

I&#39;m honestly not a fan of all these specialty burgers (massive size loaded with topics) but Kuma&#39;s hasn&#39;t disappointed me yet. They&#39;ve improved their service since their opening. Attentive waiters, food came out in reasonable time and together."

Anticipating a wait, we arrived about 4:45 on a Saturday afternoon &amp; were seated immediately.  We were stunned since we were expecting long lines for this place on a Saturday afternoon.  This was my second time to this location, having been to the main one in the city, but Kelly&#39;s first &amp; she had been warned about the music.  She is not a fan of screaming death metal.  

Kelly &amp; I perused the menu.  Since Kuma&#39;s burgers are 10 oz, we decided to split a burger and an entree mac &amp; cheese.  We ordered the Kaijo burger, house chips  &amp; their  bacon  &amp; mushroom mac n cheese.  They came out in about 15 minutes.  We split the dishes as I waited to see Kelly&#39;s reaction as she tried both.  The look on her face was pretty much a food-gasm.  She couldn&#39;t stop saying OMG to both.  The burger was extremely flavorful, a bit more cooked than we had requested but was awesome.  Their house chips are outstanding as well.  Thin, cooked &amp; salted perfectly for my liking....and even better when used to eat mac &amp; cheese on.  

As far as the mac &amp; cheese, it was fantastic.  Just the right combination of cheeses to pasta, the bacon &amp; shrooms were cooked perfectly.  The bowl they bring it out in is HUGE though.  Be forewarned.  Between the burger &amp; the mac &amp; cheese, we had to take some of the mac n cheese home, but were very sad to throw it out since it wasn&#39;t going to last 5+ hrs in a 90 degree car.  

Service was great too.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable, patient, making all kinds of recommendations, checking on us frequently, etc.  

As we left, I asked Kelly for a rating.  She said 4.5 out of 5 (didn&#39;t care for SOME of the music).  As a metalhead knowing what I was getting into, I thought the whole experience was awesome.  We look forward to coming back &amp; eating with the senior metalheads at 4:30!"

This place always has a crowd, be it lunch or dinner. However, I have never had to wait for over 30 min to get seated. It&#39;s great to see a  new burger to try in their &#34;burger of the month&#34; section. And each of their burgers is so distinctly different from the other in terms of toppings. I have tried many of the crazy ones , including a BOTM which had chicken and waffles on top of the patty. This place is definitely worth a try if you&#39;re in for a good burger and beer that is reasonably priced. Their house chips are well seasoned and I recommend you try it.
One of the issues I do have with Kuma&#39;s Corner in Chicago ( not Schaumburg) is that although they&#39;re open until late, their service gets sloppy and the place gets extremely dirty... sticky tables and chairs, spilled food and drink on the floor which isn&#39;t cleaned up, dirty restrooms... and the dark and dingy ambience only adds to it.

This place is by far my favorite to get a burger. I love the other locations, but they&#39;re a bit harder to get to and the wait is longer so the Schaumburg location has made getting a great burger much easier.

They&#39;ve got a huge beer menu and it&#39;s amazing. There&#39;s a beer for everyone and every burger.

Great. So I guess they sold out like the Metallica music they play! How ironic! All kidding aside, they serve the exact same food, but the portions, quality and atmosphere is quite different.

I understand first and foremost how they have to accommodate the suburban demographic, so of course hipsters should probably go to the original one on Belmont or kumas two. The music has also been censored somewhat as to not drive off the customers. Gone are the hard stoner, grindcore, death metal and replaced are: Metallica (later) mastodon (later) the sword (later) and five finger death punch (all) . See where I&#39;m going with this?

I ordered the plague bringer burger and the oven did not heat this fully. It came out lukewarm, and the fries were portioned smaller.

Stick  to kumas corner or kumas two, unless you are already in the area . Either way, it&#39;s worth the trip to Belmont!"

I really didn&#39;t want to be let down. The Chicago locations have been hyped up for several years by friends and co-workers, and I&#39;ve never had the opportunity to venture out that way.

That said, as soon as this location opened up, I was excited to finally give Kuma&#39;s Corner a shot. My wife and I came here for a date night on a Monday evening (9pm) and we were able to get seated immediately.

One thing I loved from the start was that there were no sports stations on the television sets... the ambience was subdued and intimate. I was nervous about how loud the metal music was going to be, but pleasantly surprised that my wife and I could easily carry on a conversation.

What was on the tv screens were various obscure and popular metal music videos.My wife didn&#39;t realize I knew so many lyrics to Metallica&#39;s &#34;One&#34;, a result of several hours of Guitar Hero in my college days.

The burgers... forget about it! Easily the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had. The price was a little startling at first, but after tasting the combinations of flavors, the value was clear. I had the Slayer, which is basically a bunless chili burger, but don&#39;t let my description fool you. It was rich and hearty, and I was thankful for the mountain of fries to offset the savory goodness. Ask for extra &#34;Anger&#34;... ;)

My wife had the Goatsnake and the pairing of goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette was surprising and addictive. This burger is one that is hard to put down between bites and I fought hard to resist having more than just a taste.

In the end, the overall experience lived up to the hype. The service was attentive and patient, there was no wait time (it was late evening), and the food was innovative and beyond my imagination. We will be back to experience the other burgers as well as the well-renowned mac and cheese. Though my wife and I are not the biggest metalheads... For the time we were there, we really wanted to be."

We came at lunchtime on a Saturday and were able to be immediately seated in the bar area at a high-top or outside (only a wait for a regular table but there wasn&#39;t a big line or anything). Since it&#39;s summer-time and we weren&#39;t going home immediately we opted to share an appetizer and a burger so we wouldn&#39;t have any leftovers going to waste.  We shared the Jalapeno Poppers stuffed with ground chorizo and cheddar served with a raspberry jam type of dipping sauce.  Wow, were those good...and pricey at $12 (so $2 for each as there were 6 on the platter). They were mighty tasty at least.

For the burger we shared the Goatsnake and it was one of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had (I&#39;ve been on a roll with mighty good burgers lately, for the most part). It was cooked perfectly medium-rare and topped with herbed goat cheese, corn relish, fried onion strings and an amazing Cholula-lemon vinaigrette which really was an absolutely perfect condiment for this burger. Their housemade chips were okay - not amazing, but all right.

They also have a rather extensive beer list so you have plenty of options to pair with your meal.  The service was okay, though a bit awkward since all the high-tops in the bar area are very close together (seriously, there isn&#39;t room to walk between if you have others seated at the tables next to you, you&#39;ll have to walk around/behind).  We enjoyed watching the old metal music videos we hadn&#39;t seen in ages.  It is loud in there with the metal music playing but it wasn&#39;t like rock-concert loud or anything and we really enjoyed it."

It&#39;s basically just slightly glamorized bar food, which is fine by me, but when they try too hard to make it more than what it really is (and attempt to charge accordingly), that is when concepts tend to lose me. &#34;Gastropub&#34; is probably one of the most overused descriptors in the restaurant game these days, and Kuma&#39;s is the case in point of why it has become so cliche and boring. Throwing artichoke hearts or other random toppings on a burger and calling it a day is not &#34;gourmet&#34;. 

We stopped in on a Thursday afternoon for lunch and the place was pretty busy for 1:30. We got seated right away and our extremely hot waitress (I will give her that much) got our drink order out to us rapidly. Beer selection here is quite good, with several great offerings on tap to choose from to marinate your palate. I am just now beginning to experiment with the various microbrews in this state, which is an exciting process if you are an ardent beer drinker. That said, Illinois has a very long way to go to compete with the Wisconsin brewers for craft beers. 

Like most high end burger chains, you have a wide assortment of topping selections to choose from here. The signature Kuma Burger with fried egg on top was what I decided to go with. They have several other topping concoctions as well as a &#34;Burger of the Month&#34; offering. It was pretty tasty and totally adequate, but once again, nothing that I have not had elsewhere that was far better. What many of the Red Robin type places of the world seem to forget is that the meat is what makes all the difference in the world on burgers, and It just did not have a robust flavor to it at all. Investing in some house ground Angus is far more likely to impress me than trying to get cute with toppings. The fries here were crispy enough, but too over seasoned for my taste. 

Overall, while the food here was decent, I would take Fuddruckers or Five Guys over this place any day of the week, and it&#39;s cheaper."

The burger was simple and came with fried egg. I don&#39;t know how this could go wrong. I think it was due to too much juice from the meat made my burger suggy. Or I was not in a mood for eating too much fat?

 But I remember the burger at their original location was much better. And I know my burger was not suggy that night. 

I need to find a good burger joint."

The number of stars I&#39;d rate them teeters between 2 and 3 stars.  Over the years, increasingly, I am not a fan.  However, I can tell you that some of my extended family and friends (which live in these parts) think it&#39;s pretty awesome.  I&#39;d say many of them would rate it a solid 4 or 5 stars.  On occasion I&#39;ve bumped into them here (and if I walk in here, it&#39;s very uncommon and random) and  some would occasionally place catering orders.  If I&#39;m here, it&#39;s because I was dragged kicking and complaining.  

A lot of Indians dig the food as do Americans looking for that &#34;butta chicken&#34; or &#34;Indian fix.&#34;  

Me... It&#39;s not impressive.  Driving a little farther in any direction would yield better results.  I&#39;m not saying every experience has to be impressive, but it should be consistent.  From the taste of the biriyani, or the butter chicken or the style of their breads, something should remind you of why you dined there.  

Most would dig their flavors, which are plentiful although pretty bland.  With the often mix of clientele, they always keep it bland.  I&#39;ve tried getting carry out orders that lacked the spice level I requested.  

Lastly, with the number of &#34;bar / restaurant rescue&#34; type shows out there.  They could do a bit of housekeeping.  If there&#39;s a reason to keep the kitchen door open, sweep up the floor.  How many food bits need to be down there? Wipe down a table or table accessory, so that it isn&#39;t icky to the touch."

Thankfully, I&#39;m not completely in the dog house, as my husband, travelling on business, DID enjoy the food at Cuisine of India.  Another slight annoyance:  though they had a full menu available, they didn&#39;t seem excited to cook from it and pushed the dinner buffet hard.  

So, though he didn&#39;t have the relaxed curry dinner he had planned for (buffets are NEVER about relaxed eating now, are they and this is not a posh restaurant), he thought  the food was good (Butter Chicken, Lamb Rogan Josh + many others) and liked that they they brought hot naan straight to your table along with a sizzling hot plate of chicken tikka pieces.

Then when I reached the branch and started to eat the Biryani and it was horrible. I meant it was tasteless. Biryani isn&#39;t made this way at all. The so called Biryani was boiled rice with ( fried vegi and goat with no indian spices) it was like someone tossed rice and the fried vegi with goat. I have never had such bad food. I don&#39;t know about the rest of the entrees on the menu but Biryani is a waste of money. I am still shocked how they can call this Biryani.

Wonderful North Indian food Punjabi style. The dinner buffet is certainly value for money. I would say the food here is as good as Jaipur restaurant or India House. Authentic Rajasthani/punjabi/north indian flavors. Mild flavors though. Buffet is not extremely spicy.

It was good, but I didn&#39;t find it super excellent, more in the 3.5 star category for me.

Yes, they have a nice large buffet, with somewhat more dishes than average probably, and it was good though nothing hit me as a reason to make the trip.

At lunch (that day at least) the naan was just another item on the steam table and it was lukewarm and somewhat soggy. This was disappointing having read the other review mentioning &#34;hot naan brought straight to the table&#34; which probably would have pushed them up to 4 stars in my book.

Will think about giving them another try for dinner and update this review as appropriate.

I go every time my stomach allows. $10 gets you 2 tables of options with plenty of sauce to drench your rice and naan in. Nice and spicy and strong for those who like lots of flavor.

It is an Indian buffet in a strip mall so lets get that outta the way (But then again, Illinois has everything in a strip mall so this might not be so alarming to you). 

Not a soul in here on a Wednesday night at around 8pm. I was the Buffet King for about an hour. Wide variety of dishes (at least 10) all of which worked for me. Pretty decent samosas. They bring the free bown soup (direct Indian tranlsation) and tandoori chicken to your table, sizzling like it was from Sizzler. Your standard tasty fried sugar dough balls (again, a direct Indian translation) and mango ice cream. 

If I am ever back in the neighborhood and have a hankering for Indian food, this is the first place I am going to."

I used to do lunch here every Wednesday, but I now have too many places that I like, so it does not come up in the rotation as often.  At work we refer to it as &#34;the Indian place&#34;, because it is the only one we go to.

Cuisine of India is in a strip mall.  The decor leaves something to be desired as do the environmental controls.  It is often too cool in the winter and too hot in the summer.

So why do I keep coming back?  The food is the answer.  The lunch buffet is the best way to eat Indian food.  I always start my meal with a samosa.  Then I take a little of this and a little of that.  I love the mattar paneer and the lamb dish.  The naan is precooked and left in a big pile for the buffet.  The quality varies greatly from day to day.  Most of the time it is good, but there are days when the naan is cool and soggy and the lamb is all bones, but luckily that is not the norm.

As with most restaurants, the price has been going up.  As of today it is $9.95 per person.  If it wasn&#39;t for the tasty food, I would think twice about paying this much.  Even though it is a buffet, there is a limit to how much I can eat!

Cuisine of India is a good solid choice for lunch and you will not go away hungry.  There is room for improvement, but I will be back."

I would say that I had the worst experience at this restaurant in the 20 years that I have lived in the area.  My family decided to give this restaurant a chance and went there for the dinner buffet on a weekday.  The restaurant was not very busy, but we waited about 10 minutes to get seated since there was only 1 person multi-tasking as the host, waiter, cashier, etc. for everyone.  This person eventually pointed to a certain area of the restaurant and mumbled for us to sit over there.  

As others indicated, the food in the buffet was cold and did not look fresh but was edible.  Some dishes in the buffet were spicy. Our 3-year old son tried a curry dish and must have had a bite of a really hot pepper, since he would not eat anything else after that.  After a while, the owner stopped by to pick up our plates and saw that my son&#39;s plate still had food in it.  He then asked my son why he had not finished the food in his plate.  I thought the owner was trying to be playful, but my wife explained to the owner that my son had eaten something really spicy and would not eat anything else.  Instead of showing any concern or acknowledgement, the owner just mumbled something and took the plate and walked away.  We thought the owner&#39;s behavior was rude, but didn&#39;t really think much more about it.  

When we eventually went to the cash register to pay, the owner started telling us that they normally do not charge for kids, but he was going to charge us because our son had &#34;wasted&#34; food and that we should have given him less food.  At this point, we honestly could not believe what we were hearing.  So, instead of showing any concern that the food was too spicy for our child, this person was doing the exact opposite and complaining about wasting a small quantity of food in a child&#39;s plate and about how he is going to charge us for it.  We really did not care about him charging for the child&#39;s buffet even though they usually do not, but I never imagined a restaurant owner telling me how I should feed my child.  We obviously told the owner about his complete lack of customer service and rude behavior during our visit there, but he did not really seem to agree.  So, we tried to end the conversation and leave as quickly as possible, but told him that we would be sharing our experience with everyone so they do not make the same mistake that we did by dining there.  I usually do not write lengthy reviews such as this, but wanted to make sure everyone was informed about our horrible experience at this restaurant."

We&#39;ve been coming here for years (a bunch of cranky office workers) to bitch about this or that. Every single time, I do the poo dance. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s this place or just the spices that seriously do not agree with me. Well, this last time, was it. I&#39;ve sworn off Indian food for good. I refuse to eat here or any other Indian restaurant ever again. 

The problem is that I&#39;ve had Indian food before (coworkers make it) and one other place in Oak Park. Well, it&#39;s tasty enough, but I can&#39;t deal with the cramping afterwards. So that&#39;s it. I&#39;m done. No more. Thai please."

I&#39;ve had Indian food from here to London (and all over Devon Ave), and nobody beats Cuisine of India in Mt Prospect. A buffet at both lunch and dinner? Outta sight. The chef here is masterful with his spice blending- the heat never overpowers the other flavors (and there are a lot of them). His Mutter Paneer is not to be missed. He mixes up the items in the buffet so it&#39;s never the same twice. And today it had 10 or 12 different entrees... in addition to samosas, pekora, salad, and desserts. There are always vegetable options and lighter fare. For me, it&#39;s all about the sauces. When I do takeout (I&#39;m lucky enough to live nearby), I always get the peas (Mutter Paneer) or the Navrattan (7 vegetable) Curry, plus Murgh Makhni (butter chicken). Or try their dish called Chili Chicken; the spicy, bright red sauce is phenomenal. 
I have eaten here for over a dozen years.  It is a simple business.  There is always seating.  They play cool Indian music softly most of the time. I bring all my friends and adventurous dates to Cuisine of India.  It&#39;s crazy to have bragging rights of this caliper out here in the burbs."

The samosas are huge here and was convinced that I had to go back for seconds for them.

On to the food. I know none of these names. And I can&#39;t do spicy food. That part of me sucks. But there is a plentiful amount of salad and chutney (I remembered that one!). Try the yogurt based dressing and you are set. I dabbled in all the eleven courses offered but was most impressed by the radiantly-colored-red-chicken, the lamb with gravy and the green pea infused rice. 

The aftercourse offerings were mango ice cream, rice pudding and fried dough with a spectacular taste. 

They do have a bar, so if you want some Indian beer or a beverage aside from water, ask the waiter who&#39;s busting his nuts off bussing the tables. 

The price was adequate, though not very filling. It&#39;s all right from time to time, but there are other places in this strip mall and it&#39;s not too far for my lunch, so I will come back."

My criteria is usually based on my desire to return to a particular place, 4 stars meaning very likely, and 3 meaning not as likely. I have officially tried enough Indian restaurants to recognize mediocrity. I sampled the buffet and found several hits and few misses. The days selection wasn&#39;t as good as I&#39;ve seen in other buffets, only seeing 3 vegetarian dishes for the day. One big problem I had was the freshness of ingredients, I could clearly see the potato component of the vegetable dish consisted of frozen french fries. 
On the flip side, the tandoori chicken was brought to the table separately along with warn nan, and both were great. I was also a fan of the stewed lamb and the curried lentils, both very good. Maybe it was the buffet choices for the day not jiving with my particular tastes, but I left here feeling a bit underwhelmed. This is even after renewing my membership to the clean plate club. Who knows, another visit here on another day might bump this place up to a 4 star joint."

No, it&#39;s not always the freshest, or the spiciest, or the cleanest, but 9 times out of 10 it is all of that.

Once I forgot my credit card and he said I dont have to pay until next time I come in.  (I paid him later that day though, I am not out to use anyone.)

Appetizers:
1) Iceberg lettuce, unripe tomato, cucumber
2) 2 chutneys, 1 raita
3) giant samosas, rubbery pakora

Entrees
1) Peas paneer
2) Deep-fried red-colored cauliflower (???)
3) Chana masala (chickpeas)
4) alu beans (that&#39;s what they called it - was potato &amp; green beans)
5) chicken murgh (drumsticks)
6) tandoori chicken (thighs &amp; drumsticks)
7) lamb curry (mashed boneless lamb chunks)
8) basmati &amp; naan

Desserts
1) Mango Kulfi (granita-like dessert from powder mix)
2) Halwa (grated carrots)
3) Gulab Jamun (fried balls milt pastry soaked in syrup served hot)

Pros: Inexpensive, decent array of dishes

Cons: 
1) Poor ambiance
2) A touch salty &amp; oily
3) Chicken dark meat only
4) Naan is not made fresh for each table and a bit rubbery
5) Food has a less fine preparation

Finale: I&#39;d rather dine at Himalayan up in Niles.  Same price.  Better selection.  Way less oily or salty.  Finer preparation.  Buffet selections vary every time we&#39;ve been, even on the same days of the week (they&#39;ll have maybe 1-2 different dishes from the prior visit) AND they even change dishes on the buffet during your meal - you get to sample more dishes.  Better ambiance.  Higher turnover of dishes means fresher items on the buffet."

Nothing fancy inside. A row of approximately ten sterno warmers by the front windows includes lamb (yes!), chicken (x3 variety), something with potato and peas, rice, something with yogurt, and salad. I&#39;m bad with names.

The buffet also comes with hot naan and sizzling tandoori chicken, brought out separately. I&#39;ve had better naan elsewhere. The tandoori can be a bit dry and I felt bad for not finishing it as I preferred their buffet dishes.

Next to the hot dishes were three types of dessert. I love their mango ice cream and the creamy rice pudding.

Make sure you go hungry."

Wasn&#39;t a fan of the Dal Mahkni which is one of my favorites. Beware of bones in the Lamb and Chicken dishes(almost cracked a crown). I guess it all just seemed a little bland for Indian and not because it wasn&#39;t spicy enough. Something just seemed like it was missing. Great mango Lassi&#39;s.

But the Cuisine of India has a solid-quality buffet line. I &#39;ve been coming here for years, and the food has rarely disappointed me. It&#39;s helpful to get there early, of course, but sometimes, food that&#39;s been marinating for a couple hours can be very satisfying. Your choice! The standard rice and pakora + samosas (HUGE) are always on the buffet, and they change around the entrees  on occasion: with @ least 2-3 meat dishes for the carnies. Carnivores, that is. Not circus people. As long as I&#39;m offending people, there&#39;s also a bar for all you lushes.
My friends usually enjoy the rogan josh (lamb curry). The salad is never brown, which is nice. I&#39;ve definitely been to spicier Indian restaurants, but there&#39;s still more than enough kick to make the heat-seekers happy. (Palak paneer)

The lunch buffet is cheaper ($7.95) than the dinner one (I BELIEVE they just raised it to $10.95). The sizzling tandoori chicken comes automatically with dinner and is included in the price. It arrives on a bed of onions and w/ limes to garnish. I&#39;m a veggie, so I can&#39;t vouch for how it tastes, however! Naan is supposed to come automatically with the price for both lunch and dinner. I&#39;ve seen it on the buffet table, and have had the waiter bring it out to us @ our table.

There are almost always gulab jamuns (fried doughy-cheese-balls in sugar syrup) and mango &#34;ice cream&#34; available. Occasionally a kheer, too. AND... If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll find their fruit salad there one day. Very rich and very sweet desserts. My kind of place.

They close in between lunch and dinner, so call to double check what the hours are!"

There was a huge selection and everything was very delicious!! Some Indian buffets lack meat items and thus my carnivorous husband leaves unsatisfied. Cuisine of India had at least 4 meat dishes including chili chicken, rogan josh (lamb curry), tandoori chicken, and chicken korma not to mention countless veggie items including dal makhani, matar paneer makhani, ghobi aloo, baighan burta, samosas, pakoras, and more! All were very good! Oh, and the dessert is to DIE FOR! Mango ice cream (amazing), gulab jhamun (fluffy and hot - the best I&#39;ve ever had!), and kheer (a little thick but still very tasty).

I&#39;m a nondairy pescetarian which means except for eating fish I&#39;m basically vegan. I&#39;m also really health conscious and count macros. Those are the number of carbs, fats, and proteins I eat daily.

Food was amazingly good! My aunt and I both ordered shrimp and scallops. She had the lemon butter sauce and I had the Asian ginger one (can&#39;t recall exact name). My husband ordered a pork chop I think (it wasn&#39;t fish). They both really enjoyed their food, our plates were completely cleaned.

My food was also cooked almost perfect, my scallops could have been done a little less done but they made them to order with no oil which is likely why mine were more done because my aunts looked perfect. The scallops are on the smaller side with this dish since you&#39;re getting 5 of them and Shrimp plus 2 sides, the price was good too. 

It&#39;s a little small inside and kinda loud, I heard they might be expanding and I think they do need more space.

The best part of the experience was the service (not that the food is bad, it was good) the service was top notch and I think in today&#39;s world that says something. We arrived early for our reservation by about 45 minutes. They were able to check us in early and have is seated within 15 minutes. The waitress was amazing letting me know which items had dairy in them and asking the chefs to make my food with no oil. My drink was never empty either. A lot of attention to detail given in a busy place where customers often have the little things missed.

Thank you for a great meal. I will eat here agin when I&#39;m in the area for sure! I have family in that neighborhood and have recommended they check it out as well."

The Martinis:
These are some of the best martinis I have ever tasted.  The winter land martini is a must during the winter months.  And the current summertime watermelon and very martinis are so delicious!

As it was a Tuesday, the special offering was called &#34;Hooked on Tuesday.&#34;  This must be the deal of the century!  They offer what they call a &#34;three course dinner&#34; in four different price categories.  Each category also has three entree options.  While the lowest and unbeatably priced first category was tempting, all 4 of us opted for the next higher priced group.  Yes, it was a three course meal, but it came with all the bells and whistles.  There was a choice between two nicely sized salads, either house or Caesar; a choice of one entree out of three plus your selection of any two sides from an adequate list, and dessert.  The choices were tempting, the service was outstanding and the price was not to be believed.  I had the House salad with assorted greens, grape tomatoes, pitted kalamata olives, hearts of palm, pine nuts and a citrus herb vinaigrette that was marvelous . 

 I ordered an 8 oz Atlantic salmon filet in a light butter sauce, and two hearty sides, sautéed spinach and delicious potatoes au gratin. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the sides were fresh and well prepared.  We lingered so long, savoring every course, that we had to leave for class before we could eat dessert.  They were kind enough to wrap our desserts  and hold them for pick up after class.

i will save the desserts as a surprise, but will say there wasn&#39;t one i would turn my back on.  The choices were top notch!  So much delicious food for such a modest price.  I could see myself having dinner there every Tuesday, forever.  The surroundings were relaxing and pleasant and the wait staff was attentive and accommodating.  I look forward to trying their specials and regular menu items on other days of the week, especially their Sunday Brunch. 

To find such a jewel in my own backyard is great stroke of luck and i intend to make a habit of dining there.  The evening we spent was a lovely surprise, an exceptional treat and possibly the best deal in town."

As my boyfriend and I enter, the waitress ask if we were a table of 2. We answered yes, but right after, another Asian family walks in, and the waitress automatically assumes we were all together. It is disappointing and upsetting to see any restaurant to have such immature behavior and prejudice against Asians. 

Despite such impression, I do admit that the food was great. I definitely think it was worth the money. I ordered a tilapia with lemon butter sauce, and the fish was juicy and tender while the sauce was not heavy or oily.

In the Midwest where it can be hard to find good seafood that doesn&#39;t cost a fortune, it&#39;s a reasonably priced choice and is generally consistent. 

Always start with the Bang Bang Shrimp; the creamy sauce is a touch spicy, but the shrimp are sizable and there are a lot in the serving to share. 

For my meal I had the Corn Chowder &amp; Lump Crab, a soup really emphasizing the sweetness of the seafood; tasty but it benefited from some pepper added tableside. The entree of grilled shrimp &amp; sea scallops was also very tasty, offset by simple lemon butter. 

The one issue with the meal came when our well-meaning waitress accidentally dropped the dish of pesto oil from the appetizer bread on my mom: the oil was in a small dish on the larger bread plate and just slid right off onto her. The waitress was extremely apologetic (she wouldn&#39;t even let my dad tip her as much at the end as he planned), and accidents happen, but it did get all over Mom&#39;s sweater. The waitress went to get the manager, who went through this whole rigmarole of telling my mom to bring in the dry cleaning receipt and the restaurant will pay for it. Oh, you live out of state? Well, email it and we will mail you the price. (I mean seriously, it&#39;s not just easier to take off the cost of the appetizer or a glass of wine or something? I guess they&#39;re just hoping you won&#39;t bother and they&#39;ll save some $.) Weird...

Bang bang shrimp tasted like a lot a mayonnaise...

Calamari was ok... Safer choice, harder to ruin. And seriously... Calamari is always chewy so it&#39;s funny when people complain that it&#39;s chewy... It&#39;s a texture thing.

I ordered the crab cake and sirloin. My steak was cooked well, but salty. My crab cake was ok, but all my veggies were drowned in salt. 

The tilapia and stuffed shrimp was okay. 

This place is kinda pricy for the quality you get. Your better off going to a Red Lobster which is comparable to this type of establishment. And I&#39;m not even a fan of red lobster, but I would choose over this place."

 their bang bang shrimp is the winner if only they put more shrimp than too much lettuce at the bottom. Our server was ok but like some resto not as visible as you need. Another downside is the lights. It&#39;s just too dark. I know it&#39;s for ambience and all but not that dark. I had a hard time reading the menu. Just wondered how the elderly people got by at the other table."

I&#39;ve been here twice now. The complimentary bread is very yummy. You can&#39;t beat bang bang shrimp - and I don&#39;t even like seafood! My server has always been very kind and helpful.

Located next to the Schaumburg library, this place was the only place with a filled parking lot in that location. When we got there at 5:40, the parking was already getting cramped which is always a good sign. 

We ordered the:

Ahi Tuna Sashimi: (around 10 dollars for a &#34;regular&#34;)&#34; It was seared well on the outside. Came on a bed of lettuce with wasabi, soy, pickled ginger and a sauce on top of the fish. (See Picture)

Bang Bang Shrimp (10.50): What this place is famous for. I completely get why it is so popular. The shrimp are tender on the inside and fried crispy with a spicy and creamy sauce. Very good. 

Blackberry Smash: (3.50): For the price, I&#39;m surprised there isn&#39;t any booze in it but either way this is one fantastically tasty and refreshing drink. Its fruity and minty and just sweet enough. Reminds me of a fruitier mojito. (See picture)

Lobster roll. (around 16 dollars): They certainly didn&#39;t skimp on the lobster unlike way too many other places around here. You can see giant chunks everywhere. It came with a coleslaw that had a sweet ginger kick which I liked and some fries. Unfortunately they burned my bun but the management was very quick to try and rectify the situation. 

Every meal here comes with fresh bread which was delicious and olive oil with pesto. 

Overall I&#39;d say this place is a winner for food and especially service. The moment I pointed out the roll in my lobster roll was burned, management came by a minute later and offered me another order of it. I didn&#39;t take it but they ended up not charging me for the dish which was very thoughtful. Our server was quick, knowledgeable and on point. 

We will definitely be back."

I was surprised because I have passed this place every day for the past 10 years and never tried it until recently.  
 
From the food to the service, everything was well executed but the real kicker was the Bang Bang Shrimp - it&#39;s seriously the bomb. It&#39;s fried shrimp tossed in a creamy sweet and spicy sauce with a touch of an unknown addictive substance. If fried bite size pieces of succulent shrimp tossed in mayo, Thai chili sauce, and sriracha doesn&#39;t excite you, then you won&#39;t enjoy what makes the shrimp so bang bang. It&#39;s highly addictive and might have been laced with something because I am having withdrawal symptoms. The menu is reasonably priced from small plates to large entrees. Our scallops were cooked well and I loved the ahi tuna tacos.
 
Bonefish is really the perfect inbetweener with the variety and the price point. It&#39;s a step up from Red Lobster and not as expensive as Shaw&#39;s. Just don&#39;t forget about the Bang Bang Shrimp (intentional redundancy)."

Bang bang shrimp - the crunch and heat to it is ok.

Oscar Omelet - hubby ordered something light but he mentioned how he couldn&#39;t taste the crab and the asparagus was a bit overwhelming.

Creme Brule french toast - i picked this because i love creme Brule.  For some reason, the char from the bread was so strong it gave me a weird taste after one bite. I know they served it with whipped and mint plus strawberries but thats what got me excited the most. Maybe i will try this again without it being way too burnt.

Well, that would be because I became violently ill within 30 minutes of eating the red pepper and tomato soup.
I was unable to eat my entree and my husband and I were compelled to leave. I spent the next 4 hours vomiting. I felt terrible for days, and eventually it concluded with intestinal distress.
Upon calling the restaurant, I was asked for my info to give their insurance company.
When contacted the agent indicated that no one else reported becoming ill so obviously it could not be a food borne illness. I don&#39;t understand that conclusion without adequate testing. I was told that I may have food allergies. Respectfully, I do not. 
In the past I had eaten here several times before with satisfactory experiences. 
I currently have lost all confidence in the basic food safety practices of this establishment and their protocols for responding to questionable practices. I will never dine at any Bonefish Grill again. For those of you that choose to, I encourage you to report any circumstances involving illness related to your dining experience."

Decor: It was a pretty standard restaurant as far as the inside, but I&#39;d venture to say that it is actually a bit more upscale. While I don&#39;t think you&#39;d be particularly out of place coming to eat and dressing completely casual, you&#39;ll fit in better if you&#39;re dressed a bit nicer.
Bathroom: Spotless and inviting!

Staff: Our waitress was one of the best I have had EVER. She was friendly, fast, and did everything absolutely perfect. She was there when we needed her and not when we didn&#39;t. She kept our water glasses full and provided excellent recommendations on the menu items.

Food/Drinks: It&#39;s a seafood place, so you have to get the seafood. And why wouldn&#39;t you, it is all cooked PERFECTLY. We had an assortment of items but my salmon was wonderful and, just like everyone else, the Bang Bang Shrimp is absolutely amazing. It&#39;s definitely a must-get item.

Value: It&#39;s a bit more expensive, for some items, than your average place but it is definitely worth it. The food quality is A+ and the preparation is fantastic.

I can&#39;t wait to come back for another meal. The only thing I&#39;m disappointed with is myself - I&#39;ve driven by many a BF location and never stopped in - I wish I had dined here years ago!"

It was pretty good and the serving was quite large for an appetizer. 

For dinner I ordered one of the fish specials. I can&#39;t remember the name of the fish but the server described it as having the density of lobster which it actually did. The sauce was some kind of lemon garlic butter and it came with a couscous kale salad which was very refreshing. For someone that is health conscious, I think this is a great place to go since the platters come with a big kick of protein and veggies.

The service was good. Nothing better than I&#39;ve experienced before and nothing worse either."

We went for early dinner, around 5pm like old folks.  Seated right away with our 2 kids.  Started out with Bang-bang shrimp and the starter bread was good. I know, but the bread was something we enjoyed eating as a family.
I had the Baja fish tacos, hubby had the Fontina Chop, son had the kobe burger and daughter the bang-bang shrimp tacos.
We enjoyed our food and definitely will be back in the future. Just a word of advice, skip the salad or soup, I didn&#39;t know that they charged extra, $3.10, for it.  My mistake...
The waiter was awesome (sorry didn&#39;t remember your name); attentive and he even told us that the salmon is &#39;heart healthy&#39;. Nice spiel!
The ambience is laid back, we didn&#39;t have to wait long for our food. Our experience was worth it."

So came here for brunch since we were in a seafood mood. Been here a few times for dinner and it&#39;s pretty good. Nice service and very clean restaurant. So looking at the menu, we usually get the mussel appetizer. It wasn&#39;t on the brunch menu but we just asked out server and he was able to make it for us to props to him. For 10 bucks it&#39;s pretty good size and I love the flavor. Makes really good dipping sauce for the bread.

I ordered the surf and turf eggs benedict and it was all right. Good flavor but didn&#39;t blow me away. What bugged me the most is that if you get an asparagus &#39;side&#39; it&#39;s really just 3 pieces of asparagus.... and on top of that, it didn&#39;t even taste like it was seasoned, just steamed pretty much.

My mom got the pork chop and ended up taking some of it home. I ended up eating it as a leftover and it was pretty bomb, so I can only imagine what it tasted like when it was fresh. Good flavor, good seasoning. So definitely don&#39;t feel like you have to get seafood at a seafood place."

I&#39;ve heard good things about it, but never got around to going.  After a day of training at the office, a colleague and I decided to stop there for a drink before heading home.

We arrived at around 6PM on a Friday evening. The bar was crowded, but not overly so.  There was a wait for dinner, but I did not plan to stay that long.

What I found great about the bar was the setup.  There are the traditional bar stools, all occupied.  But, between the bar and dinner booths, there are long &#34;community tables&#34; where anyone can sit.  There were a few seats open, so we grabbed them.

This is anything but a corner bar, but everyone at the table talked as if we knew each other.  I&#39;d classify this as a friendly place.  I&#39;m eager to go back to see if this holds true again.

They have a large drink menu, but I&#39;m normally a bourbon drinker.  Last night I decided to me more adventurous.  They had a $5 special for something called a Blackberry Elixer - it contained Malibu Rum, coconut water, fresh blackberries, lime and fresh herbs.  It was pretty tasty, but not one I&#39;m likely to get again.  They also serve fresh Focaccia Bread with Olive Oil.

I&#39;m eager to go back and try something on the menu. While their prices are a little high, the other patrons spoke very highly of the food."

It was not that busy and I waited over 20 minutes for someone to take my order and another hour to get the food. I had their &#34;bang bang shrimp&#34; and it was not that good but if you like high calories of garbage this appetizer is for you. They undercooked the fish that I thought it was some kind of &#34;sushi&#34; special or something. I had it sent back and they brought another one that was a little overcooked. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the waitress told the back to overcook it since she had an attitude. The owner of the place who looks like A pedophile came by and gave me the bullcrap apologies and offered a free dessert. All in all I will never go back to this dump. I am surprised to hear they have been open since 2004. I guess people like overpriced mediocre food with bad service.

Everything was great-the ambiance, service, food, wine, the prices even the water. The warm bread with the olive oil mixture was excellent. We both ordered the bang bang shrimp taco which was delicious. My sister brought it to my attention that there shrimp in every bite and she was certainly correct. We tried the house wine which was only $3.50 since it was during happy hour. I was pleasantly surprised while I was sitting there, I went on my phone to see if I could find a coupon and there was a coupon online for $10 off the meal and I just had to show the phone to the server. We would would have been out of $33.00 for the two taco meals (3 tacos and a side per meal) and two glasses of wine which ended costing us $23.00. What a deal??? I will be back coupon or no coupon. It was worth every dime."

The Bang Bang Shrimp is always a fave and their Wood-Grilled fish are so fresh and succulent that you could never go wrong with them.

This past weekend, we decided to finally check it out. A bit of a drive and located in an area with not too many other restaurants, Bonefish Grill looked to be a pretty popular place on a Friday night.

Because we were just a party of two, we were seated immediately. They had a nice little outdoor patio that was great this time of year as fall is just setting in.  I should have guessed it by the name, but this place has mainly fish.  Actually, &#34;mainly&#34; doesn&#39;t really suffice to say how fish-dominant this menu is.  On their gluten free menu, only one option was fish-free, and I&#39;m pretty sure that on the regular menu the non-fish options had a very small section as well.  Unfortunately, I&#39;m allergic to fish and shellfish (I know, I&#39;m a bit of a bubble child), so my entree was decided for me.  I got the Lily&#39;s Chicken and my mom got some sort of fish.

The good news?  I think my mom really liked her fish!  The bad news?  My chicken was kind of gross. It came with spinach, cheese, and artichoke hearts on top, and both of our dishes came with ratatouille on the side. In my opinion, the spinach was slimy and the ratatouille was bland. The artichoke hearts on my dish were practically half the size of the chicken breast!  I ended up just scraping it all off and eating the chicken plain, and even plain the chicken didn&#39;t taste very good.

However, Bonefish Grill does have one thing going for it --- their fresh bread. My mom wouldn&#39;t stop talking about what a bummer it was that I couldn&#39;t eat it. Apparently it was &#34;so fresh and warm and delicious&#34;... thanks, Mom. Oh, and their desserts were pretty good too. I&#39;m a huge fan of crème brûlée, and I was super excited when the menu said theirs came with fresh berries on top. Apparently fresh berries means one blueberry, but the crème brûlée itself was decent. 

Basically, if you&#39;re a huge fish fanatic and you&#39;re in the area, maybe you should give this place a shot. Personally, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back to Bonefish Grill. It&#39;s overpriced and nothing special."

I made reservations for 7:30pm and specifically said it was for our wedding anniversary. We got there and the hostess confirmed our reservation for 2 and they gave us a table notifier to let us know when they were ready to seat us. We didn&#39;t get seated for 45 minutes. Why did I make a reservation when walk-ins were getting seated within the same waiting time? The couple after us who just walked in were seated at the same time as us.

Wedding anniversary was not acknoledged. Every restaurant that I make a reservation at mentions our anniversary and congratulates us or does something special on the house. Not this place, it just seemed like they wanted to move us in and out like cattle and they didn&#39;t ask what brings us to  Bonefish, if this is our first time there, or what&#39;s the occasion.

My wife ordered Chilean sea bass and I ordered the lobster tails entree. The server came back to me 10 minutes later and asked me if I wanted two lobster tails or one? The menu for the lobster tails said two lobster tails so he left me confused. I also asked if they had hot green tea and the server didn&#39;t know so he gave me all the tea bags that they had and had me pick out the green tea.

Overall, the food was okay, but the service and experience was very bad. I would recommend Red Lobster over Bonefish.

Very disappointed."

Honestly, I expected so much more maybe that is why I was so disappointed. I had a party about 7-8 of us and the waitress kept forgetting to put different appetizer orders and also forgot about majority of our drinks throughout the night meaning someone went from having one type of beer to another and it would not be brought out until that person finally mentioned, &#39; hey, I never got my beer I ordered&#39; it would have made complete sense if the place was busy but by the time we were seated it as dying down and when we were getting ready to leave there was only about 5 tables the rest of the room was empty. Moving on, another person who ordered their entree had their food taken back three times due to it being the wrong order. They messed up the salad added something that they asked to be taken off I believe it was onions-- when they came back the salad had nothing but dressing which is not what they asked for they simply only wanted the onions off, then the actual meal was wrong as well."

We were trying to find a place for dinner and could not decide. My sis and I debated and debated. You would think we were deciding on what kind of car to buy. We both wanted to try something new. We talked about &#39;that place at the corner of Roselle and Schaumburg &#39;, both us us afraid to try it. Were we dressed properly? What is the pricing like? What do they serve? What are the Yelp reviews like?

I, driving, and my Yelp reviewer assistant riding shotgun, I heard enough when we heard bacon wrapped scallops in one review, I knew that would please my sister.  I&#39;m sure glad we gave it a chance.

So, you walk through the entrance into a very comfortable and relaxing setting. The host stand is set back a little ways, but don&#39;t fret, the host actually came to the door to greet us like Grandma would come out from the kitchen when you arrive at her house. 

We were seated immediately which was quite surprising considering they were very busy. I guess we just have awesome timing. 


I love pesto.  I love pesto even more when mixed with oil and served with bread to dip! Bread was hot from the oven and I thought about potentially skipping dinner and just eating bread, but I&#39;m glad I opted to eat because it just got better after the bread.

I have been hearing about the Bang Bang Shrimp forever. Of course, we had to try it. Have you ever had shrimp melt in your mouth like butter? I have. It&#39;s from Bonefish Grill. Seriously, if I could just go here and eat the Bang Bang Shrimp with a glass of wine and maybe a little bread. I&#39;m all set.

I am not much of a seafood fan except for calamari and shrimp, so I opted for a non-seafood entree. I went with the chops. HUGE pork chops. The sauce was different and delicious. I ordered the au gratin potatoes which looked great but sadly, were not served hot. This is the one and only reason for the missing fifth star. Their veggie of the day was chickpeas and peppers. I&#39;m surprised, but I have to say, I loved the veggies. I think I ate more chickpeas than Pork Chop, if I&#39;m telling the truth. They were that good.

My sister and I ask a lot of questions. We discovered that you can add a crab cake for 5 bucks to any entree. And she really wanted to try one, so she got the shrimp and scallops and added a crab cake. She was nice enough to give me a shrimp and I&#39;m telling you, their shrimp is very fresh. The lemon butter dipping sauce perfectly complimented the grilled shrimp. Yum. She held a gun to my head and forced me to try the crab cake, and I have to be honest. It was really good. I might even get one next time or at least convince my fiancé to try one so I can have one more bite.

Seriously, there must be something wrong with me to have not been here ever before but don&#39;t worry, Bonefish....I WILL be back."

A spinach side was large and melt-in-your-mouth tender. The noise level was fairly high, then worsened when they turned on the house music, which was all vocals and added to the din.

They have really nice, healthy kids meals that you don&#39;t find everywhere. Fresh fish and steamed veggies for the little guy. I like their fish tacos, fish and chips, as well as their more traditional dinner items. I ordered a tilapia sandwich on our most recent visit and regretted it, but that is about my choice and not their cooking. 

The servers and hosts are always friendly and welcoming, and the restroom is clean and nice (with changing table, thank you.) It&#39;s well located too, with a duck pond and fountain behind perfect for a stroll in nice weather."

Amazing service, okay food. I really wanted to give this restaurant more stars, but the food that we ordered was so so, maybe it was the type of food we ordered. We ended up going with a large party for my wife&#39;s birthday with her family. For our large party they had two servers which helped expedite the process. Servers were super attentive and nice with taking orders and making sure everything is okay. The dessert they give for the birthday person is so so, 2 chocolate covered strawberry with raspberry glaze and 4 blue berries. Looks nice. No complaints because my wife&#39;s favorite dessert is the oberweiss chocolate ice cream cake which they let us serve without charging us a plate charge. Your meal comes with a plank of warm bread which you can ask for more. The calamari and coconut shrimp were cooked perfectly. The coconut shrimp were large and well flavored without too much grease. The main entree for a beef lover was limited (sirloin or filet) and the largest steak was 11 oz sirloin for ~20 dollar. The beef was so so, but I should have expected this as this is not a steak house. It comes with a side of vegetables that was zucchini with tomato (very odd taste, likely canned tomato) and a scoop of au gratin potato (or other sides) This tasted like something you made from a box. All and all I will give this place another try, maybe try a seafood dish next time and see if that taste better, but A+ on the customer service.

Pro- excellent customer service, great appetizers, warm bread

Con- the main entree (steak) was not good along with the sides

Hidden deals-
1. Wednesday 5 dollar bang bang shrimp
2. Check out the website for super saving. They had a 19.99 summer catch menu that had lobster tail, 2 scallops, 2 shrimp along with the vegetables and side."

We got the salmon with spinach bacon and gorgonzola, the tilapia imperial, and a side of crab fried rice. All three things were soooo salty that I couldn&#39;t eat even half of the tilapia. The Salmon was okay, but the tilapia was overcooked and dry. 

Service was not great considering that they weren&#39;t busy at all. Ordered a beer and it came out after the entrees...

Some other things we had include the wild salmon which was strong but fresh, fish tacos (tilapia), and Arctic char which was more buttery in comparison to salmon and something our waitress recommended.

Food times are always great, never had to send a meal back...maybe I will try take-out to avoid the servers...

As a former server and bartender for 8+ years, I was so disappointed in my experiences here.  I have dined here on many occasions and will not be back. This very last visit was the worst. I came for early dinner (probably around 4pm- so before the dinner rush). The hostess sat our party of 4 and let us know our server would be right with us. Well- fifteen minutes later, we still had no server. There were plenty of servers around, walking right past us, but none stopped at our table. I even spotted a manager walking around aimlessly in the dining room, but still no service. I finally had to go to the host stand to ask if we had a server and they sent someone over. I&#39;m sorry, but as a server, if you notice someone not getting served, you take care of the table. It&#39;s called teamwork. We were seated outside of the current open sections (I know this because the server made a point to place blame on the hosts- as if that would make us any less frustrated at the situation) , but still- a server should have noticed we hadnt been helped (us constantly looking around for help would have been a dead giveaway) and stepped in. I&#39;ve also been here on a weekend night when it was really busy and noticed two managers standing against the wall gabbing away, when they could be helping their servers/bartenders out of the weeds- prebussing, running food, etc. Later on in the meal, the manager had left his post against the wall to go watch tv in the bar.... still during the dinner rush. Seriously? What are they being paid for? Servers take their cue&#39;s from their managers, and on a busy night, no one should be standing around doing nothing. Lazy managers=lazy servers. This bonefish could take a lesson from the Orland Park and Algonquin  locations (which I have also visited about 3-4 times and never had a complaint). They seem to run a tight ship  and don&#39;t let any of this nonsense fly. 
My advice- clean house, starting from the top."

We love seafood and this restaurant didn&#39;t disappoint us.  The food was good, and we really loved the menus options. We had great service! 
The reasons I didn&#39;t give it 5 stars is because it was a little too expensive for small portions and the taste profile they use relies too heavily upon spicy/hot."

The atmosphere was nice it was a good change of pace not seeing a bunch of people on there cellphones. The waiter was very nice had excellent knowledge on the food i kinda quizzed him. I had the boom boom shrimp tacos my guest had the kobe beef burger. Mine was excellent and my guest told me it was the best burger he has ever had. We also had the creme burlee and it was excellent will def go there again great place

We always come here, so when we walked in and saw how busy and chaotic it was, we knew something was up. Had a 3:00 reservation, we were told that it would be a 25 min wait, which was fine. We were seated 45 minutes later, and ordered immediately. We noticed that all around us, no one was eating and besides appetizers, food wasn&#39;t really coming out of the kitchen. Our waiter had informed us that not only were they already short staffed one person, but one of the chefs had walked out on them in the middle of his shift earlier in the day...hence where all the problems and delays were coming from. They offered us and every other table around us free appetizers (more than once) and started handing out $25 gift cards. Our waiter disappeared for a bit, and when he came back he told us it was cause he was in the kitchen the whole time helping them cook. It had been 2 and half hours by the time we got our food. Of course we were a little bit annoyed but we knew that it wasn&#39;t any of their faults for the delays. When we got our check we were honestly pleasantly surprised that they had comped us for EVERYTHING. Appetizers, drinks, and three dinners. They did the same for all the other tables too. We felt so bad cause I can&#39;t even imagine how much money they must have lost that day. Despite all of that our waiter and everyone who had come up to us was still so nice and accommodating and you could really tell that they were doing the best they could. I have been to this restaurant so many times and this has been my only &#34;bad&#34; experience here, and even in a time like this I still felt like the customer service was fantastic. I&#39;m always gonna be a big fan of this place :)"

As far as the food- I am dying for their Florida Cobb salad and their mussels Josephine. They offer four different sauces to choose from for the grilled fish and change them every season. Furthermore,  they have recently completely updated the menu. If you go there on Monday, they might have a Monday Martini night for 5$. You have to try the raspberry Martini! !"

Food is good but not great. The bang-bang shrimp is very good and I liked it. But the Spicy Tuna entree I ordered is total bland. The tuna is not spicy at all and not as fresh as I have hoped from a restaurant like this."

Someone gave my wife a gift card for her birthday and we said let&#39;s get it over with.  Wow, talk about being pleasantly surprised!    We went without a reservation and were seated immediately.  We ordered the calamari with bang bang sauce, and half dozen oysters Rockefeller&#39;s. The squid was perrrrfect. Light breading, flash fried, delicious. The oysters should have been called bacon Rockefeller.  It was bad. In a wink they took it off the bill.  Oak wood grilled rainbow trout for the wife. I had the wood grilled shrimp and scallops. Both were loaded with smoky goodness. Really good!  Ended it by splitting a coconut cream pie.  I&#39;ve never had a c c pie like this.  The lower cream section was a little thick and mild tasting. The next layer was tasty sweet coconut. Topped by home made cream with toasted coconut. It was the best I ever had. Many layers of flavored goodness. All I can say about this visit is I&#39;m going back there. The food was good. Everybody around us were enjoying their food, and our waiter Kirk knew the menu like the back of his hand. He was more than helpful, not over bearing, and seemed like a good fellow who was really good at his Job. We interacted with 6 different employees and the manager. All were top flight professionals.

Visiting from a city that just opened  a Bonefish restaurant. My brother loves this place and made a reservation for 5:45 party of 5. After 30 minutes we said we would take any table available and were seated. It took 15 minutes for drinks to arrive. No water even after request. Ordered appetizers and were served but we had no silverware. Had to flag down waitress. Again. Ordered food. When it arrived, my sister in law could not eat her dinner, fish was very dry.

All of the fish is fresh and the portions are so huge! Not only are the portion sizes big but the pieces themselves are monstrous as well. I had a salmon &amp; avocado roll today that was so thick, I had to take each piece in two bites. My tiny mouth didn&#39;t help matters much! 

I bet you&#39;re thinking these giant sized maki rolls run at least 10 buckaroos a pop. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh (that&#39;s my buzzer noise)! Wrong! Nu uh!!! These colossal servings run $4-$6 for most rolls. 

Insane in the membrane!!! Fresh fish, tasty rolls, massive helpings, good prices...what are you waiting for?!"

This is the grab and go section of Mitsuwa Marketplace and you simply choose what you like and pay at the register. There are plenty of options ranging from different rolls, onigiri, bento boxes, and fresh nigiri. We chose 2 different boxes of the assorted nigiri combo and were satisfied. 

The fish was very fresh, good quality, and well prepared. However, we wished there was some wasabi under the salmon and tuna nigiri pieces. The rice was cooked perfectly but could use a bit more seasoning and sushi vinegar.

Nonetheless, the nigiri boxes were well worth it for the price of around $12-13. Next time we&#39;re in the Chicago area, well definitely be stopping by for more."

It is a few long, refrigerated cases that are filled with already-packaged pieces of sushi and other Japanese lunches. It&#39;s a grab and go/express type set up, where you pay at the cash register of the supermarket area of Mistuwa. 

The variety is pretty impressive. Whether you&#39;re a fan of fish or not, there&#39;s an offering for you. Common items like tuna rolls, California rolls, and salmon rolls are available, either on their own or in bigger combination trays. Then there are offerings with eggs, eel, and even baby octopus. Everything is insanely fresh, which is a huge plus. The rolls are also pretty massive in size. 

I was expecting to pay a lot more than I did. I get sushi fairly often from a place near my house, where I get less variety and way less quality. At this other place I get a pack of nine tiny rolls for about $10. Not here! Six of these giant crab rolls cost only $6.99 here, and they don&#39;t look as though they&#39;ve been sitting out all day. 

I also got a &#34;deluxe&#34; tray, which has $18 various rolls for only 16$ or so. It tastes good, and is well worth the price."

I bought a massive Cali roll for $5.  Offerings at Daikichi are simple like spicy shrimp roll, crab roll, salmon roll.  The roll itself is extra large, but some of the individual pieces are 2 bites each.

To purchase, grab what you want and then pay at the regular grocery checkout.  The security guard stared down my friend and I, like we were going to bury salmon rolls in our pants.  Even if I wanted to, I had leggings on, and those pieces of sushi are so large that there would be bulges in places there shouldn&#39;t be.  The security guard reminds me of the lame cop from &#34;Superbad.&#34;

The cashier will ration your wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce.

Daikichi is located inside Mitsuwa Marketplace.  I would buy sushi here again, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for it."

Granted Daikichi is located within the Midwest&#39;s largest Japanese market/superstore, it should still be noted that this stuff is damn fine... and for non-fancy schmancy rolls, the best bargain/bet I&#39;ve seen - ever. EVER.

This is some SERIOUS sushi. So serious, in fact, that I&#39;m going to be doing a whole heck of a lot of caps locking over the course of this review. 

BEWARE: There&#39;s a definite choking hazard with these HUGE, heaping pieces. And not just a buncha rice and filler - I&#39;m taking giant chunks of ultra fresh fish, expertly sliced. Obviously some ninjas are employed here. 

If you go later in the evening/day, your selection is highly limited, but if you are able to make it in mid-day, it&#39;s PRIMO as far as options. You can get sushi, sashimi, stuffed rice paper balls, bento boxes that you can re-heat in their microwave ( a little ghetto, but the price is right). 

The prices are crazy. Like, before I was buying the stuff I got kind of worried as to how quality the fish could be considering how many GIANT rolls I was getting and how much fish was packed into the package, but it was sooo good! So good, in fact, that my dude and I ended up fighting over the pieces (even though one package is more than enough food for a full meal for one person) to the point that we decided to go back in and buy another giant package. 

The only annoying thing is that you have to ask for soy sauce when you purchase the sushi, it&#39;s not just out for you to take, so your soy sauce intake is limited to however many packets the Mitsuwa cashier will give you (hint: it&#39;s never enough) and the little solo cup is too small for the size of the sushi rolls so you can&#39;t really dip your as is. Also, there&#39;s no fresh wasabi - you get the mustard packet wasabi, but it still tasted fine and if that helps keep the cost down I can be okay with it. 

I go to Mitsuwa fairly frequently but this was my first time purchasing sushi from Daikichi. I think because I usually go after 3pm and at that point there really isn&#39;t much left in the long case, but on this particular occasion I had managed to get my ass up before noon and was able to partake in the fishy fruits of Daikichi&#39;s loins... which is the grossest statement ever, but I&#39;m going with it. 

Holy Moly Roll-y and Beam me up, Daikichi!"

I am not a huge fan of pork and would typically order chicken tacos at a Mexican restaurant, but my fiancé said I would love the Al Pastor tacos. I&#39;m so glad I tried something new, the pork was so tender and flavorful- I could taste small notes of pineapple. The simple garnish of onion, cilantro, and lime complemented the pork- I had to make sure I had a little bit of everything in each bite and topped it off with a mixture of the green and red house made hot sauce to give it heat....

It was good, random bits of pepper in bites, which was yummy, and you can&#39;t go wrong with avocado. My only complaint is that it wasn&#39;t very filling since it was just the sandwich. My fiance ordered the steak, cheese and beans gordita dinner. I had a bite and wasn&#39;t a fan, but he thought it was good. He completely cleaned off his plate (minus a tomato, but he&#39;s slowly liking those now). The beans were perfect texture and had a delightful taste.

The entire menu is mainly in Spanish  and the good news for my coworkers is I came along &amp; am fluent. Bam! I translated some of the veggies &amp; toppings for them so they&#39;d know exactly what they&#39;re getting. 

I had a Lime Jarritos and La Gringa Torta which is appropriate since I&#39;m a white girl and all. La Gringa comes with eggs, ham, two types of cheese, mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes. I absolutely loved this but it&#39;s huge! It&#39;s $4.99 which is a very good price for the size. After chowing down on the complimentary tortilla chips, I could only muster the strength to finish a half of the torta. I have lunch for tomorrow, woohoo!

When you&#39;re done, you pay up at the front. I suggest getting a smoothie to go on your way out for $2.50. My friend got the pina colada today and it was Mmm Mmm Delicioso!

The menu was written in Spanish for the most part but with a little help from the waitress and my very limited knowledge of a few basic words it was fine. The breakfast menu was small but it had just the right stuff for an authentic Mexican meal. 

The plates (who am I kidding - these were platters) came loaded with food including the traditional rice and beans and everything was freshly prepared, piping hot and loaded with flavor. I had to wave the white flag about half way in, but my husband happily dug in and made a pretty good dent in what was left. 

The atmosphere isn&#39;t quite Hole-in-the-Wall, but maybe more just broken in and casual. Either way, a return visit will be on my list of things to do to check out their dinner items."

Well, Los Compadres Taqueria isn&#39;t perfect, but it definitely fills the void! 

It&#39;s situated in an old Pizza Hut. I didn&#39;t need to research that or anything, you just know it when you see it. Or a Sunday afternoon, this place is packed to the gills! The post church crowd can be found here stuffing a myriad of eats into their hungry bellies. And my oh my is the menu large. Beyond the traditional tacos and enchiladas, there are plenty of options that will likely satiate the masses at very reasonable prices - tostadas, combination platters, sides, burritos, etc. 

I went with the chicken enchiladas de mole- a huge platter piled high with generously stuffed enchiladas, covered in mole sauce, sprinkled with cheese and spooning the plentiful portion of rice and beans. The mole, while tasty, was a bit too rich when topped with the shredded cheese. Next time I would probably go cheeseless on those enchiladas...and I love cheese, so that&#39;s saying a lot. The chicken inside the enchilada was super tender and flavorful! I had enough left over for a substantial lunch the next day, too.

Aside from the food, the coffee they make is also out of this world. Just the right amount of cinnamon to give it a little pep but not over bearing.

The amount of food you do get for the price you pay is very generous. Also If your up by the register, they do have some sweets to go.

At to the food, the tacos were fine, but certainly not that filling. A lot of onion and a little cilantro on each didn&#39;t help.

I finally figured out that the reason I get such bizarre service regarding the payment of the bill is that they do not actually want to bring the check to your table.  They expect you to walk up to the counter and tell them your table number.  This is after they have come to your table to take your order and they deliver the food to your table.  In any normal restaurant that operates like this, they would at least bring you the bill, even if they expect you to pay at the counter.
So my colleagues and I finish our meal and then stand in line at the counter.  Since we are bothering to get up, we decided we might as well pay separately.  Each of us in turn states our table number and what food we ordered.  Then we complete several individual transactions.  I understand the process, but I don&#39;t like it.  In fact, I must admit that it discourages me from going to Los Compadres for lunch.

It is that irritation that resulted in my updated review and the loss of a star in my opinion.  To be honest, I would like to give a 3.5 rating, because the food is still very good, but service is so important to a restaurant.

When people say the food is authentic, what I think they also mean is that the place is chock full of Spanish speaking families who appreciate the great prices and flavorful cuisine.  Tele-novelas and FIFA games are prominent on the big screens that surround the dining room.

No, it is NOT for the Uncle Julio&#39;s Hacienda crowd, who enjoy their Mexican food served with plenty of overpriced Anglo flair.  Los Compadres is a restaurant that serves the predominantly Hispanic community along this stretch of Algonquin Rd. Though I suspect the good cuisine and prices draw customers from Des Plaines, Mt. Prospect, Elk Grove and Arlington areas as well. 

This place really reminds me of Latin restaurants down in Cicero, IL, where my daughter lived. Where I was wholly dependent on her Spanish skills to place my order. Same relaxed and welcoming vibe.

I had the mole enchiladas, which were the best I&#39;ve had. You get SO MUCH food for a great price as well. I barely touched my rice and beans, but did make sure to sample them. They don&#39;t serve alcohol, but there was a full menu of Jarritos, so that was a bonus.

My toddler got the kids burrito, which came with french fries. OMG, even the fries were delicious!

I&#39;m not sure if this is the BEST Mexican food in the area, but it&#39;s a serious contender and hands down the most authentic. Make sure to give it a shot!"

I hadn&#39;t had much luck with Mexican out here in the burbs, but this place is a real winner.

We started with a couple of lime Jarritos and basket of chips which were fresh and came with a cup of pleasantly hot salsa while we looked over the menu. There were a ton of appetizing choices and one of the walls was covered with photos of most of them. I got a vegetarian torta (avocado, cheese, onion, tomato, refried beans) and a side of rice (yellow rice with vegetables mixed in), and my date ordered a carne asada torta combo, which came with fries.

Everything was out on the table in about six or seven minutes. My rice and sandwich were absolutely delicious, and my date loved hers as well. She made a few modifications to hers and was relieved that everything came out correctly (I say this only because people will ALWAYS mention when something goes wrong). I have trouble finding any fault with this place whatsoever (wait, I found one, they didn&#39;t have takeout menus!).

I can&#39;t wait to go back."

It forces us to get out of the office at least once a week (pathetic, I know).  The food isn&#39;t the best, but is surely is one of the best in the area.  We work in Rolling Meadows were there are probably 5 other Mexican restaurants around us, and we seem to enjoy this one the best.  

I usually just order tacos (hey, I really like tacos), but have paid attention to what others have eaten and the food usually doesn&#39;t come out greasy. It isn&#39;t over seasoned with salt.  The food is good (not great) and consistent.  I had brought my son here one afternoon (he&#39;s another taco fan) and he also enjoyed the food.  

I think the prices are very reasonable.  Just eating three tacos is under six bucks.  Add rice and beans I believe its only a dollar or so more.  

The salsa served with the chips is not as consistent.  It always tastes good, but the spiciness of it varies from bland to damn, what was that.  It is usually somewhere in the middle, but we have noticed it varying.  


See you there on Thursday.  :)"

It is right across the street from where I live.  My family typically has take out from here about once a week.  I 9/10 get a steak burrito, my boyfriend gets two steak tacos and an order of rice, I get my 6 year old a steak taco and my 2 year old a small cheese quesadilla and I get an extra order of rice for the girls to share...all this comes out to about $20.  The staff is super friendly, prices are low, HUGE HUGE HUGE menu.  All the meat is very good quality (no gristle in steak)..chorizo however is a little dry in the burrito or on a taco (the Huevos con chorizo is fantastic however).  The nachos are GINORMOUS and are 2-2.5 meals in itself.  Pretty much the only complaints I have are parking low is very tiny and a part of a very busy strip mall.  Also, I&#39;ve always done take out and if you don&#39;t call ahead, the wait is pretty long (like 10 minutes+ long), which is good because you know you&#39;re getting fresh food, but still...call ahead.

Still loving this place!!!  However, does anyone know if they have coupons anywhere?  Would love to see a Groupon for this place (not that the price is bad now)."

They have quite an extensive menu here , more than the standard tacos, burritos , tostadas ,and tortas. I ordered a chicken taco and steak burrito to go. The place was not crowded at all and it took 15 minutes for my order to arrive So I knew the food had to be freshly prepared. The steak in the burrito was extremely fresh, soft, not the least bit dry, lean and deliciously seasoned. It was moist but not greasy, almost melt in your mouth texture. This was the best burrito I have eaten in years. At $5.99 it was a steal considering the quality and size of the burrito. The chicken taco came in a small cardboard dish. It contained large chunks of tender white meat chicken. It was not quite as good as the burrito but still it was  better than average. The red and green salsa both had nice flavor both about a 7 on a scale of 1-10`for heat. There are many Mexican restaurants closer to home but I will drive past them all from now on for this terrific food."

The food seemed authentic to me. The fact that there was a large Mexican clientele seems to validate this too.  I had the Burrito suizo con pollo.  The portions were large and inexpensive. The salsa roja and verde with the chips were both pleasantly spicy and flavorful.

The menu is so authentic that we had to ask our waitress to translate the lunch special. But something got lost in translation. We did catch the word, tripe and since neither one of us were brave enough to try that, we skipped the lunch special. I found out later that tripe is a popular Mexican dish.  

We ended up ordering our lunch based on the pictures inside the menu. There was a  Spanish/English translation and photos for most entrees and drinks. The lunch special was the only item missing that combination.

I have not been to a better Mexican restaurant in the Chicago area. The food was delicious and plentiful. Service was good and friendly. 

The only drawback for me is that I prefer fountain drinks. They serve pop/soda/Coke in cans, but the waitress brought me a glass of ice when I asked, so it was like having a fountain drink. 

Many of the families and others eating there would be eating the same thing for lunch if they were back in Mexico. It is a  busy, distinctively truly, honest, ethnic restaurant. It is no Taco Bell, Pepe&#39;s or Chevy&#39;s. 

It&#39;s not fancy. It&#39;s fun -- I&#39;d call it a Mexican diner. I will definitely go back again and tell all my friends who like Mexican food -- &#34;Try this place.&#34;"

My boyfriend and I had a taste for mexican food one evening. We turned to Yelp to read good reviews about mexican places around here and Los Compadres came up and i read alot of good review about it  and i always drive past it to and from work and it always seems busy so i figured the food must be pretty good. So since its down the street from our apartment i decided I would call in an order and pick it up. i ordered a torta de asada and my boyfriend got some taco deal that included rice and beans, and we both got 2 large horchata drinks. The lady on the phone said it would take 10 minutes. i got there in 10 minutes and food was already ready. So that was a plus. My torta was was not the best torta I&#39;ve had. definetly not. And i would know about mexican food because im mexican.The torta had mayo in it which is not what shoukd be in there. It sould;ve had sour cream. It seemed very flat and small oh and yea it came with fries which was super wierd to serve fries at a mexican restaurant. My boyfriend wasnt too impressed with his meal either. He said they werent bad he&#39;s had better but he ate them because he was super hungry after work. so basically just settled for it because of hunger which is what i basically did also with my torta. The horchata was ok. nothing special. wasnt bad but wasnt super duper. just mediocre rice water. The price for it was a bit high for my boyfriend and I considering we just got our apartment and are trying to find good food but at a cheap economical price. just dont think we got our money&#39;s worth for the food. It cudve been way better.
   All in all, dont think we will be going back there. We&#39;ve had better mexican food from other places. from now on if we crave mexican food,we will just drive dow the street to taco bell."

When I handed my gift card to my waiter, he told me he cannot use it as it will only be valid at India House (I was a little confused and annoyed, but said okay). The next week I decided to go to India House, and when it came time to pay, they told me the EXACT opposite of what Bombay Chopsticks had told me (that it will only work at Bombay Chopsticks). The manager came by to tell me this, because at this point I was very irritated that they kept giving me conflicting information.

If there is any chance of giving negative rating I would do that.

We went here for dinner on Friday, I have ordered for chicken 65, which is not actual chicken 65 it was saucy and the chicken is so hard it seems not freshly prepared, I love Hyderabad chicken biryani so I order it but it doesn&#39;t even taste like biryani, it&#39;s wet like sambar rice or I can&#39;t name it what they serve. Price was too much doesn&#39;t worth it.Guys please stop using name Hyderabad biryani name and stop spoiling our name. And finally mango lassi we ordered 2 of them for Togo, after reaching we noticed one with water and other with mango lassi. Service was very bad and worst ,I have posted photos too.

So guys please think before going to this restaurant."

Took over twenty minutes for the waiter to give us our check after we had finished (we had to flag someone down and ask for it) and about the same to get the card run (we had to flag someone else down for that). Go to any other Indian restaurant on this road and you are bound to be less disappointed than I was!

Common guys $17 for panner burji and all I get is just half a cup of food, with no rice. When I asked them why I was not served rice with an entree they were so rude and said no we don&#39;t serve that and we have never served something like that and may be it was my first visit here. If you cannot give your customers a cup of rice I dont know what service they offer.

My dad ordered the veg thali and guess what subji was there in the thali, the paneer burji, SERIOUSLY !!! Also his thali did not come with a naan. When asked they said that our basket of garlic naan contained his naan, but could not find it. May be it disappeared on its way.

One the whole was a very bad experience for everyone and would expect someone from the management to look into these issues.

Will definitely not go back again."

We had a very polite and attentive server, so happy about that.  This place is decorated in a modern fashion, unlike other Indian restaurant joints that looks and smells like India (sorry, no offense).  I love that they have a very decent ventilation system that prevents the very strong smell of Indian food circulating around and making you smell like curry all day long.  I love eating Indian food, I just don&#39;t want to smell like the pot it came out of.  This restaurant is located in a strip mall of Indian grocery and practically everything India House (catering and Bombay Chopsticks) and minutes away from Woodfield mall, minutes away from my house so I love the proximity.  

Let&#39;s talk food... I ordered samosa (2), they were as big as my head!   Ok, just kidding, maybe as big as a newborn&#39;s head, so I thought that was worth $6!  It was tasty and not greasy.  It came with 3 sauces one of which was a chutney.  Yummm!!!  I also ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Biryani.  Both were amazing... MUST HAVE for sure.  

I will most definitely come back, only with a groupon deal again because the entrees were pretty pricey.  An average of $18 per entree, but most specialties and fish entrees were over $30!   Dang.

Enjoy!"

For a half empty restaurant I had to constantly ask for a server. I mentioned this to the store manager, Nicholas Parrara, who insisted on arguing with me about my comment. I politely stated he should not make a seen, especially in front of my guest, but he insisted on wanting to argue with me my concerns.  He stated &#34;My server stated he was giving good service&#34; which concerned me even more on his ability to manage a restaurant.  I think the owners of the brand needs to relook at the inexperience that they are hiring in their restaurant.  I will state the food was good, but the manager did a great job of finishing our evening poorly.  It is a shame as I will need to think twice before taking any guests here to Introduce Indian Cuisine.  Well done, NICHOLAS, as you have earned a whopping 0 star for professionalism and manners.

I probably wont be coming back. I walked in and the &#34;please wait to be seated&#34; was a joke, no one even paid attention to us for three minutes until I made my way to an employee. Once we were seated we had no idea what to do, we waited a few more minutes until someone dropped off some chicken on a hot plate and still had no instructions. So we just went to the buffet and started eating.

The food/naan/chicken were all good, but this place seems very amateur. The had plates coming out of what was this metal contraption and they had actually had a rice cooker on the table instead of putting the rice in some metal tray... that was pretty funny.

We went to grab dessert and they had this disgusting ice cream scooper in a pool of orange water... not the best way to serve mango ice cream. Doesn&#39;t seem sanitary at all.

Food was 4/5 and service 1/5. It was pretty much a free for all which is pretty stupid for how many employees I saw walking around."

I hadn&#39;t visited for several months, and I stopped by recently.  Their credit card POS system was apparently down, so they asked if I could pay cash.  I couldn&#39;t so they wanted to write my credit card number...not gonna happen.  Instead, I just told them I&#39;d come by later in the week and pay, and they accepted that.

Today I visited again, mainly because they had Palak Paneer.  It was awful.  Tasted stale, as though it were leftovers from another day that were reheated for the buffet line.  Naan came overcooked - despite the fact that I&#39;m a regular and specifically request it less done (and have for years).  In general, the food today was not prepared as well as I&#39;ve come to expect, and I think it&#39;s clear that over time, things have declined.

I pointed these things out to the manager, who shrugged it off - did nothing to make it better.  Very uncharacteristic, but perhaps they&#39;ve just stopped trying at this location.

It&#39;s still a pretty good value, but it&#39;s no longer the best option in the area.  Consistency is what matters, and they&#39;ve forgotten that."

The first thing I noticed was how nicely decorated it was inside. It had the ambiance of a nice sit down restaurant even though it was a buffet. They even had a table in the corner that had its own private space. We came pretty late (past 1 PM) but there were still quite a few people eating lunch. 

I don&#39;t really eat Indian food too often, so I don&#39;t have much else to compare to, but I thought the food here was really good. Even some of the people in my group who aren&#39;t too adventurous when it comes to trying new foods found something they liked. The lunch buffet is an especially good option for those of us who haven&#39;t tried too much Indian food and can sample a lot of different things without committing to a single dish. Usually when I go to a buffet, whether Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Mexican I load up my plate with straight up piles of meat. This particular buffet only had 2-3 meat items, although all of them were pretty tasty. I wasn&#39;t expecting to get so full off Indian food, especially with such few meat options, but a lot of the items I had were pretty damn rich. One thing that was missing that I&#39;ve seen at other buffets was the papad.

Some of the items I tried from the buffet:

Naan - They brought out a few baskets of freshly made naan for the table. I don&#39;t know about other people, but I use my naan like a utensil. Everything gets dipped in or picked up with a piece of naan. I went through that stuff insanely fast. The guys working there must&#39;ve taken notice and kept em coming. Bonus points. 

Tandoori Chicken - In addition to the buffet they brought out a sizzling platter of chicken for the table. It was hot n juicy without much spice.  

Vegetarian Samosas - Deep fried pastry filled with potatoes and peas. Maybe they were sitting out for a while but I thought they could&#39;ve been crispier.

Paneer Makhani - Chunks of cheese in a thick, creamy tomato based sauce. Dipping the naan in this stuff was pretty money. 

Chicken Makhani - Pieces of chicken in a similar creamy tomato sauce as the paneer. I would&#39;ve liked bigger pieces of chicken since they were pretty thinly sliced, but the flavor was legit. 

Some sort of Goat dish - well spiced goat in a brown sauce.

Mango ice cream - sweet and refreshing

Gulab jamun - Talk about dense. Super sweet balls of dough sitting in syrup. I felt like I gained a couple pounds after eating this haha


Overall I&#39;d say it was pretty good. None of the items were mind blowing but it&#39;s a good option if you&#39;re hungry and have the taste for some Indian food."

About 9 of us went here last diwali and were handed &#34;specially printed to go menus&#34;  and lo and behold, the price of each dish was 3-4 dollars higher than usual. Mind you at 14-15 for a dish is anyway too much for the quality of food served, but this was really disappointing.

I&#39;m in the Chicago-ish area for about two months training for a new job rooming with three other people that I&#39;d never met before this trip. As it just so happens, one of my co-workers/temporary housemates is Indian. He visited some other Indian friends in the area and they told him he had to check this place out. So here we are.

The service was prompt and the server was great at making recommendations. I actually didn&#39;t order a thing - I just let my co-worker order a bunch of stuff.

To begin with, we were brought a bowl of naan pieces with what I can only describe as an Indian tomato soup. No idea what it was called, but it was super yummy. Then the food arrived. 

The lamb kabobs were really good. While lamb can sometimes be gamey, these were not at all. Perfectly seasoned and not too spicy, they were amazing. The biryani was also really good. Biryani is always my best friend&#39;s go-to at any Indian restaurant, but I never order it personally and now I&#39;m wondering why, because it was also super yummy. Finally, we got chicken chili masala, and my mouth was on fire in the best possible way. I think the reason I love Indian spicy is because they&#39;re able to still pack so much flavor into the food even though at some point you really can&#39;t feel your tongue anymore. I had a second helping even though I knew my mouth would be burning.

All in all, this place was awesome! I&#39;ll definitely make it a point to come back here again before I leave the area!"

That eliminated almost all the foods on the menu for me. So, I ordered the Saffron Rice. It was the most delicious rice I have tasted.

Not too crowded.  Started off with Tandoori Pesh-Kush which is supposed to be A mixed platter of their Tandoori specialties. Was served a plater which consisted of a one  half inch sliver of what we guessed to be lamb no kidding ! One medium butterflied shrimp no kidding, two pieces of chicken tikka, one piece of fish tikka n rest of it  pieces of grilled chicken. 

Ordered a chicken soup as I was coming down with a cold and kept correcting the waiter that I ordered chicken soup and not the dhal soup. Was served bland mashed dhal with unseasoned ground chicken in it YUK! Absolutely NO chicken broth, no seasoning no cilantro as the menu indicate. No wonder he kept referring to  it as dhal soup. 

Ordered the Goan Fish Curry with was anything but Goan. Asked what kind of Fish. A couple of waiters seemed stumped by the question. Could be Mahi-Mahi, could be tilapia ! Was the response. How can they not know what&#39;s being served ?  

Three curry dishes ordered and not even one serving of simple steamed rice with it. Seriously guys these dishes are like 20-25 dollars each. Can&#39;t you afford to pitch in steamed rice ? Especially since our food bill without taxes n tips was around 120 dollars ?? Obviously can&#39;t drink the curry so ordered one rice and two naans for 17 dollars NO KIDDING !!!

  Absolutely will not be going back for overly priced below average meals. Terrible service starting with the Manager. Much better Indian restaurants close by within a 1 mile radius."

India House&#39;s lunch buffet seems to be legendary, so I jumped at the chance to lunch with my coworkers so that I could see what all the fuss was about.

It&#39;s definitely pricier than most other Indian buffets that I&#39;ve tried out, although $13 for lunch in Schaumburg isn&#39;t a deal breaker by any stretch of the imagination.  The spread is ample; there are a variety of dishes to suit most people&#39;s tastes from the vegetarians to the meat lovers.  There&#39;s even a separate area for desserts.  For sheer quantity alone, India House gets points.

Let&#39;s dig in, shall we?  Their samosas overall were just ok.  They were flavorful enough, standard samosas but nothing that&#39;s angelic choir inducing.  Actually, that&#39;s pretty much how I felt about all the dishes that I sampled.  Non offensive dishes that didn&#39;t really challenge my palette but that were tasty enough to make me go back for a second round.  The spice level was lacking, which was a definite minus for me.  When I think of Indian food, I think of a flavorful party of various pleasing spices and textures culminating on my tongue &amp; making even my fingertips smile.  I think at best, it was just ok.  What I did appreciate was the sticky gulab jamun (sans paneer, thank goodness) that reminded me of my childhood and of my grandmother.  I would come back for that alone.

With a plethora of Indian buffets around this area, I can&#39;t help but want more from India House.  I&#39;ll probably return for the gulab jamun if nothing else, but I&#39;ll take my spicy expectations elsewhere."

We dined on our Lord&#39;s birthday (Christmas). The service was horrible. This may have been due to the aforementioned holiday, but we a) Did not have an actual waiter, the host came over to our table after we asked and between seating and taking patrons&#39; names for the wait list and b) half of our to go items did not make it into our to go bag. C&#39;mon

Also, we had a party of five (nice 90s sitcom reference) and we were charged for asking for extra rice when the initial batch was not enough - $12. We were also charged for extra naan since there was not enough for five people - $6. We were not told there would be charges for either of these until we reviewed the bill.

For buffet, you can definitely go elsewhere for a much tastier and a better variety of food. The buffet food is very bland here and the dishes offered are lesser.

On their regular menu, gravies taste nice but chicken is dry and you know right away that they use frozen chicken and cook without thawing it properly. I gave it two stars only because the ambience is better as compared to other indian restaurants. But the food and service are below par. This restaurant costs more than other indian restaurants in the area."

Way too expensive for mediocre food. The quantity was good but the quality was much below average. I recommend Cool Mirchi if you want good authentic Indian food for much less.

The brunch buffet is really good though. They bring fresh naan and tandoori chicken to your table and everything else is at the buffet station.

My absolute favorite thing is their papdri chaat. Every time I&#39;ve ordered it off the menu it was a soggy mess, which is why I like the buffet option. I get to pick the sauces and ingredients. 

I end up going about once a month and love their desserts. They usually have mango ice cream and gulab jamuns. Overall if you want to give their food a try, brunch is the way to go. You get a little bit of everything and it&#39;s decently priced."

Every time, and there have been at least 6 or 7 times, I come away with a great appreciation for what they cook here. In fact, I immediately can&#39;t wait to go back.

Their tandoori lamb chops are a bit pricey but are so worth it. The way they cook it in the clay oven is unbelievable - comes out so moist. We usually get the chicken reshmi kabob which also is made in the clay oven. 

Did I mention their butter chicken is the best in the city? I mean, it&#39;s hard to mess up, but you really can&#39;t do better. 

I think if you know Indian food, this is the place to go. Its not the cheapest Indian, but they do provide good value w their buffet and they bring you naan and makhani sauce to start during dinner. The ambiance is also worth it - you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re in an Indian restaurant

Will definitely go back!

But alas, it was not meant to be...
Ambience - good
Service - good
Drinks - diluted when asked for On the Rocks and when pointed this out to the steward, she mentioned that it got diluted while it was on the way from the bar to our table. Really .....how i am supposed to believe that, not sure...
Soup - they graciously accepted to take order for the soup (lemon coriander soup) from their other restaurant Bombay Chopsticks which is next door. Really appreciate them for doing this. But Soup was pathetic. It was a lemon syrup with green onions, broccoli, white onions, and few leaves of coriander..Who puts broccoli in that soup. I know broccoli is good for health but it cannot be used anywhere and everywhere in all the dishes...I will give 0.5 out of 5 for that soup.
Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani - No doubt,chicken pieces were in abundant, however it was more of a colored pulao with all khade garam masale. The grains of the rice were not separate as it is supposed to be in biryani. I have eaten lot of biryani before in India as well as in bay area and its much much better than what i had last night. The taste was good if I call it a pulao but definitely not a biryani from any angle.
Raita - This was the only thing which i liked the most out of all...Tastes good and refreshing
Malai Kofta - ahhhh i had better days :). This was bland, no flavors at all. The koftas were so hard that if i wouldnt have been focused enough and haven&#39;t used fork and a knife to cut it, it would have definitely slipped out of my hand to some one else&#39;s table. I am reminded of Pretty Women movie scene when Julia Roberts was in the restaurant and the speciality dish slipped out of her plate to some one&#39;s hand. It was funny.
Breads - They were OK.
In the end, I am really disappointed and I wouldn&#39;t come here again !"

Oh man, Indian buffets are what gave me the confidence to go vegetarian back when I knee-high to a tandoor. So we were pumped.

The staff was super attentive. The food was hot, the naan was hot and delivered to the table. The place was clean. M&#39;lady commented, &#34;They went a little heavy with the boudoir vibe.&#34; Lush purple draperies. SEXY CHANDELIERS. Indeed, I felt a little turned-on, but I think it was from the realization I could keep going back for more chana masala and dal makhani.

Pricier than some other buffets, but also tastier. And the vibes were good: A family sitting behind us -- and their five year old daughter -- intermittently entertained m&#39;little lady, who was laughing constantly from the dancing and peekaboo that was going on behind me. Another positive!"

The hall was decorated beautifully by the India House staff, the food was kept hot and fresh, and (apparently) the price point was excellent. 

I am not an Indian food expert, so half of these descriptions are probably wrong, but I enjoyed everything immensely. Appetizers consisted of delicious fried veggies patties with sweet brown sauce, spicy chicken, and a delicious cheese that paired wonderfully with a cool green sauce. There was a delicious curried cauliflower, spinach and cheese, and chicken tikka masala that I piled high on an excellent grilled naan. Dessert was fantastic as well. There was an ice cream that tasted like a vanilla sherbet, and an angel food cake dumpling floating in a cool, creamy sauce. I had a bite of everything. 

They have a great alcohol policy - basically, you can bring your own and pay for the bartender&#39;s service - but our bartender was frankly rather awful. She definitely didn&#39;t know the first thing about bartending, and had to use her glasses to figure out which buttons on the beverage gun to push. Drinks were SUPER strong, and many of the guests (including myself) had to tell her to slow down on the pouring.Also, the dance floor in the room was probably ready to be replaced. Some of the tiles were not secure, and I stumbled a couple of times (though that might have been due to the crazy strong drinks...).

Those things aside, the outstanding food and the great atmosphere made for a great party. Two thumbs up."

I was like - this place has to be legit if we are the only non-Indians in the place. However, after sampling many dishes, we weren&#39;t too impressed with the food.  The dishes were hit or miss.  Here are our findings:

Would Order Again:

Before our appetizers and mains came, we were given some roti and a tikka sauce to dip in. Both were very tasty.

CASHEW NUT/ ALMOND ROLLS - We liked these. Imagine a hush puppy infused with Indian spices and hints of cashew/almond.

VEGETARIAN SPECIAL THALI - this was served on a tray with a selection of various dishes. My friend was super happy with her meal. She was served chana masala and jaipuri aloo. Both were very tasty. 


Would Not Order Again:

LAMB BOTI KABAB MASALA - The spicy red masala sauce was very tasty. Spot On, actually. However, the mutton was a bit too tough for my liking. I thought I was eating chunks of lamb gyro.  I will say this - there was a lot of meat.

DAL KA SHORBA (a.k.a. lentil soup) - watery and in need of more salt

ALOO GOBI - Usually aloo gobi - (well at least my friend&#39;s aloo gobi) has a bit more of a sauce element. This dish, however, did not. I honestly wasn&#39;t blown away by the flavors either. Very underwhelming dish indeed.

VEGETABLE SAMOSAS - I&#39;ve eaten a billion of these and I was so surprised to not like them. the filling tasted like pepper. that&#39;s all I could taste. CAn I have some potatoes with my pepper please?


I realize im not Indian, but after sampling Indian cuisine for over a year at someone&#39;s house, you kind of know what&#39;s good and what isn&#39;t. 

Consensus: Expensive (but what Indian Restaurant isn&#39;t expensive these days?) We would come back but would stay away from the above foods in the &#34;Would not Order Again&#34; list."

The chicken tikka is good too.

AYCE Indian buffet has one less competitor with the closing of Himalaya restaurant in Bloomingdale. After finding out that restaurant was closed we desperately searched yelp for another indian buffet. Unfortunately the schaumburg location now has been changed to a banquet hall only so we ended up journey to this location. The entrance is easy to be missed as it is located in the strip mall of Tiger Direct. The ambiance is definitely classier than other Indian restaurants around this area. The food itself was good but a bit more traditional and spicer than any other indian buffets I have been to. The chicken tikka type dish was good but made with chunks of white meat instead of dark meat which was a bit disappointing. There was also a table on the side that made some sort of mixed dish and some pastry with liquid in it. I forgot the price of the buffet but it was 12+ 

Pro: spicy Indian buffet, lots of selection however the only protein dish was the chicken curry and tandori chicken which they can bring more after you finish

Cons: a little bit more expensive than other AYCE indian buffet

When we got our bill, we were charged for 11 people and there were only 9 of us. Two people left early but gave us the cash to pay for their meals, but including those two we only had 9 people.  The servers started talking in their own language and looked as if they didn&#39;t believe us. After a while, they finally went and fixed the bill. I was surprised that 18% gratuity was added since it was a buffet.  On our way out, instead of saying the usual, &#34;Thank you.

- Pricey. We weren&#39;t there for the rumored epic buffet, so we were left with the expansive and a tad expensive regular menu. 
+ That heftily priced menu affords them some pretty swank digs, making for the seemingly perfect setting for a date... less the obligatory lone Indian diner who knows not of &#39;indoor voices&#39; and yammers on his bluetooth headpiece the entire meal until you simply can&#39;t take it anymore and ask to move. Seriously, why is this a thing? Every time I go out for Indian food, there&#39;s always &#39;that guy&#39; on the f*cking bluetooth headset.

- Service. I know there are good servers here because I saw other tables that had them, but our server was kind of a jerk. Like, a total jerk. There&#39;s about 10,000 items on the menu and we were curious about some of the items we were less familiar, but instead of answering our question, he chose to chuckle like a pompous d*ck and act like it was our first day on Earth when replying. Not.A.Fan. I also didn&#39;t like that when a glass on an empty table that was being set broke, our server stood back and actually laughed, like, an evil laugh. The kind a villain from a Disney flick would laugh, while all the other servers rushed to help. He did walk over there to point out a spot that was missed while the others cleaned, but then walked back to his wall to look on and smirk. It was creepy and if I weighted my review rating more on his service the stars would be closer to 2s than 4s. 
+ Other servers were the ones who brought our food and they were friendly, so that saved the service factor a bit. 

- The portions are rather small, especially when you go back to reference the price aspect and also, just to put it out there, I think it&#39;s totally lame and bogus when Indian restaurants don&#39;t just include the naan or rice with your entree. You pretty much need that sh*t to make the meal complete and I hate how that all adds up when it really should be part of the entree to begin with. Add an extra $1.00/$1.50 to the meal and give the people some freaking carbs. 
* The food was, in a word, outstanding. The only thing I wasn&#39;t totally in love with was the chili pakora as the batter wasn&#39;t the most appetizing, but the rest practically blew me away. I was honestly ready to feel a little sour about the food before I&#39;d even started just because the jerky waiter, dummy y on the bluetooth and the child from the table next to us whose parents allowed it to walk around the restaurant, grabbing silverware off other tables to bang against the porcelain-ware had already pissed me off to the point I thought they were about to send me into early menopause. #RageFace BUT, the food redeemed almost every negative aspect of our dining experience and has inspired me to look past all of out differences and one day return for the supposed legendary buffet."

Food:
The buffet was very nice. The small samosas were nice . &#34;Dal ka Shorba&#34; was  bland and i guess it was added to menu just to add a dish to the menu. 
The chicken curry was nice . I also enjoyed the sizzling tandoori chicken .The best part of the tandoori chicken was that it was not bland (Most of the indian restaurants in US have bland tandoori chicken.).

They also had a CHAAT counter. It was quite amazing. The only disadvantage was that you had to wait in the chaat line for your turn.

Good buffet in $12.50."

The mango lassi was a sweet creamy start to the evening. 

I wanted to try everything but settled on the India House special, a platter of tandoori chicken and fish, a lamb stew, and lentils. The chicken was ok, but I&#39;m not sure about the fish. It smelled when it came to the table and had a strong taste and it wasn&#39;t from the seasoning.  The lamb stew was tasty from the spice mixture. 

I also ordered a Hyderabad style eggplant curry.  The sauce is a medium to hot kind of spicy that lingers on the palette after you&#39;ve swallowed that bite. Very good but I&#39;ve never eaten eggplant where the stems and the tops aren&#39;t removed. 

Service was very good and they came by to switch plates a few times."

Unfortunately, I&#39;ve almost stopped going to Indian restaurants since most of them cannot seem to keep their food quality/taste consistent....this one is better in some regards and not so much in others:

Pros:
- Nice ambiance

- Food quality/taste is good but nothing exceptional (Paneer Tikka Masala was nice though)

Cons:
- Food quantity is less for what they charge for the entree

- Servers needs to be trained better in customer service (we told the server the food did not meet our standards and he just gave us a blank stare probably thinking &#34;i don&#39;t care&#34;)


We were there on a Sat nite around 8 pm and the restaurant was just half full - quite surprising since I&#39;d expect such sit in restaurants to have a full crowd at a peak nite like Sat. Anyways, overall a very OK experience."

Sadly, I will admit I may not know the difference between really good and decent Indian food cuisine. I only know what my taste buds like so I go off of that. 

With that being said, I had mixed emotions when reading Yelp&#39;s reviews on India House, so I went with an open mind, but low expectations. My bf had purchased a Groupon a while back and figured we would put it to use since my idea of cooking up some Tasty Bites lentils and rice at home didn&#39;t exactly please him. ((I know...I can&#39;t blame the guy...))

Upon walking in, we were greeted, given a nice booth by the window, some diced up naan with a delish tomato sauce, and 9-page menu ((yikes)). Since we are both vaguely familiar with Indian dishes, we decided to go with what we knew and liked and didn&#39;t branch out - much. We decided to go vegetarian for the night and skipped out on the meat dishes. 

Appetizers:
// Samosa - Stuffed triangle pastries filled with spiced potato and peas
// Padpad Rolls with Mint Chutney - Indian spring roll. Pappadum stuffed with potatoes
// Cheese Pakoras - Homemade cheese, fritters, dipped in a batter of garbanzo

Entrees: 
// Tandoori Vegetables - Vegetables, pineapple, &amp; cottage cheese seasoned with mixed spices, grilled in Tandoor
// Malai Kofta - Mix vegetable cheese dumplings cooked in a creamy hot sauce
with herbs and spices
// Saffron Rice 

Everything we had was delicious. I have no complaints. The Malai Kofta was new to us we absolutely loved it. The blend of spices, the creaminess, and the hint of heat made for perfection. The dumplings were tender and flavorful and balanced out nicely with the sauce. The complimentary naan was slightly crispy and tasted unbelievable in the spiced tomato sauce that came with it. ((I wish I knew what it was...))

Service was also great. The servers kept our water filled, and the one manager/waiter was extremely attentive. He wasn&#39;t over the top friendly - but he was helpful nonetheless. I will agree with my fellow Yelpers that the prices are rather high. I may not go back for an a la carte dinner for that reason alone. 

I loved the decor and ambiance. The chandeliers and white linen tables give the restaurant a slightly sophisticated and elegant feel. Not to mention just the sight of sparkly and bright chandeliers makes me swoon...

Final thoughts: Great food. Good service. High prices. Would I go back? Definitely...but for the lunch buffet, or with a Groupon!"

We used to go to the one in Oakbrook Terrace, but it&#39;s been closed. So now we have to drive all the way up to Golf  Rd. (We tried other Indian places nearer our  house after the Oakbrook location closed, but they were disappointing.)

It&#39;s definitely my favorite Indian restaurant. They use good quality meat, the sauces are very flavorful, and the portions are large. I used to eat at the lunch buffet in Oakbrook sometimes, and it was never a let-down. Always looked forward to the butter chicken. And yeah, you can tell that the peas come from a can, but honestly that doesn&#39;t concern me. If you&#39;re one of those &#34;I&#39;m not happy unless this cauliflower was picked fresh this morning&#34; people, you&#39;ll probably find something to complain about. But I think it tastes great and it&#39;s reasonably priced.

We&#39;ve only been to the Golf Rd. location for dinner, so I have no info about the lunch buffet there. I took off a star because if I&#39;m being honest the service is sometimes a little lacking. However, I know that going in, and I&#39;m there for the food, not to be fawned over by the staff. 

By the way, the interior of the restaurant is nice. It definitely doesn&#39;t look like a hole-in-the-wall dive in a strip mall. It&#39;s very pretty."

My review reflects my experience from two trips to this restaurant. Once during non-peak hours, the other during peak hours. Both times we walked into the restaurant waiting to be seated. The host looked at us and promptly turned around and walked away to cater to &#34;other&#34; customers without a nod or word of acknowledgement. Then he came back after 5 mins and told us the waiting time was going to be 10mins. We kept waiting (standing) and finally the seats were empty. Despite that he walked by us several times and ignored our presence. We walked out. He saw us leave and couldn&#39;t be bothered less. This type of treatment took place twice in a row.

The BF and I had to go to TigerDirect to get a power supply for his compy and made a slight detour to Ikea before, so when we got to TigerDirect, we were hungry. There were a few options, so when he was checking out power supplies, I half listened and half browsed the reviews on Yelp. He was leaning more towards Chinese, I wanted Indian...and we went with Indian :-) to be fair, he was totally for Indian also, just never thinks of going. 

We drop off the power supply in the car, and walk to the restaurant. I was slightly intimidated by the awesome decor, since we were just in normal clothes aka our rush concert shirts lol. But everyone was super nice when we walked in. We immediately saw the buffet and were seated in the adjacent room. Our waiter (possibly part owner?) walked over and told us if we&#39;re doing the buffet we can start immediately. He showed us the appetizer area and recommended we start there. We walked over and had no idea what to do lol, luckily the lovely lady behind the table explained the appetizers and created two of them for us. I believe I had the Onion Bhaji (had to look at the menu) and Andy (the BF does have a name) had a super thin pastry bowl with chickpeas inside that gets dipped in flavored water. Both were really delicious. We liked mine a little more. When we got back to the table, surprise! Tandoori Chicken had appeared with Naan! That was also amazingly delicious. 

Buffet time! After finishing up the appetizers and a piece of chicken each, we went over to the buffet. They had a lot of different dishes, I wish I remembered the names of them all. The samosas were really good, and the Chicken Tikka Masala was fantastic with the Naan. They also had lamb meatballs which were yums. I think I tried almost everything on the buffet table. I had a small cup of the soup, which was light and helped make room for all the other food. There was a slightly spicy dish with potatoes that was really good, and another with chunks of cheese that was great. Basically everything I tried was delicious. The BF agreed, it was all yums. We got back to the table, and surprise! There was another plate of Tandoori Chicken... So much food. We ended up eating almost two plates of Tandoori Chicken, almost two plates of Naan, two appetizers, a full plate from the buffet each, and some dessert. It was an awesome amount of food.

Our waiter (owner?) was awesome at refilling our glasses and I think thought we were amusing, since we were young white kids and dove right in to all the different foods. He was super nice and kept on trying to get me to eat more, lol, it worked. We ended up not eating dinner, just having a snack of cheese and crackers at like 11 that night. Our fantastic waiter also told us to next time come at 12 and eat until they close the buffet at 3...we can&#39;t wait to go back and bring friends for this 3 hour culinary adventure."

The first time I called, someone hung up on me after asking me to hold on. That should have tipped me off.....But with foolish optimism we arrived there anyway.
Parking lot was full. Arrived inside the restaurant at 7.35 PM to find about 15 people crowding around the lobby. The Manager was overwhelmed and disappeared inside for about 5 minutes. When he returned he said that he had already given my table away. We were seated about 7.50 PM. Some people left after waiting for 15 minutes as they were upset at not being even put on the list. After being seated we noticed that the restaurant was packed but there were two servers and a couple of busboys who could not keep up with cleaning the tables, etc., let alone serving food The floor was dirty! 
Fifteen minutes later someone brought us water. We tried to flag down a server but she said she was busy and would return soon. Needless to say she never came back to us. Then the Manager took our appetizer order. Another 5 minutes passed and someone brought us a naan and dip compliments of the house. This was tasty. 
The appetizers were inedible. The Tawa Paneer was covered in oil and the vegetable slices were floating atop the oil. The Fish Koliwari was heavily battered and tasteless. We requested chutney and this was brought to us right away. The Dahi Aloo Puri was stale and the dahi had a sharp taste suggesting lack of freshness. We immediately asked to send it back. The server complied but there was no apology or queries or an offer to replace it. 
The Chicken Chilli Masala entree was just a mush of oily curry with chicken thrown in. The chicken was not marinated and lacked flavor. The Paneer kulcha was good. 
When the bill arrived, we were still billed for the Dahi Aloo Puri even though we tasted one spoonful and sent it back. even paying the bill took 15 minutes. By then we had been in there 2 hours and just wanted to leave so we paid without refuting the Dahi Aloo Puri charges.
To summarize: The water was brilliant! The paneer kulcha was good. The serving sizes were generous. Too bad the food was mostly inedible. As an Indian American I am actually shocked at the poor quality of what was served. 
Quite possibly the worst Indian food I have consumed in North America, and perhaps the worst restaurant experience in memory."

We came during opening hour for lunch on a Saturday. There weren&#39;t too many people at first, but when it started getting busy, we still got fantastic service. They filled our cups every time it got close to getting low and provided Tandori Chicken even when we finished our first tray.

The food itself was decent. The appetizer potatoes were fried in several spices that brought out the flavors well. The different curry chicken and shrimp were awesome. There were enough buffet items there that I firmly believe anyone can find 2-3 dishes that they really enjoy.

The best part was the bread (naan), which they kept bringing out. I wished they could have let us take some with us. The reason why it was three stars is that none of the dishes really stuck out and left me with a feeling of having to come back for more. The overall price (tip included) was $15 for lunch which I thought was on the high end for the food we got. It&#39;s definitely worth a try if you enjoy Indian food, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d come back here frequently."

Good news about this location is that they do have the $1 any size drink, and the value menu, and they&#39;re on the way to work (for me).

I don&#39;t have any experience going inside, so I can&#39;t comment on cleanliness and the fly situation.

The only other comment about this place is that it can be hard to turn westbound during rush hour, and at times the drive-thru can be painfully slow.

I went this morning to grab breakfast at the Drive-up window, and had to wait at least 3-4 minutes before someone even greeted me through the speaker. If you are busy, at least acknowledge that you know that I am waiting and will be with me shortly.  Even further, I was halfway through my order when he yelled at me &#34;Do you have cash?&#34; &#34;We are only accepting cash, our credit card machine is not working!&#34; Why didn&#39;t you tell me at the beginning of the order that you were only accepting credit cards. The man taking my order was very rude, and curt and basically just muttered a &#34;sorry&#34; when I told him I did not have cash. That was a total waste of my time and I am very annoyed by poor level of service that I received this morning. I get things happen, and sometimes machines break, but at least be nice about it and not have an attitude with me. I will probably be going to a different location from this point forward."

She followed her manger order and put her garbage filled hands no gloves in my bag.

This pissed off the manger when i mentioned this to her she took the hash brown out threw it in the garbage.  
The manager then waited and gave the last cooked hash brown to a customer who just walked in she made me pay I had to wait untill 10:55pm before I left with a number 2.  If anyone gets a chance pull that video from that night and post it you will see this manger order a garbage filled hand worker to touch food without washing hands and dont complain you will be there for awhile."

At times, it&#39;s become our first choice for dinner/lunch simply out of convenience.  So, since we spend a good amount of time in McDonald&#39;s, I&#39;ve decided to Yelp every location we&#39;ve been to that has a PlayPlace, starting with the Schaumburg one which happens to be our favorite.

The food is the food - exactly what you&#39;d expect from a fast-food joint and a McDonald&#39;s.  We&#39;ve never had any issues with our orders here.  It&#39;s always generally &#39;fresh&#39; and served hot.  Service is consistently quick and efficient, and more often than not, cheerful.

The PlayPlace itself is laid out differently from most of the others ones we&#39;ve been to.  Rather than the usual standard indoor climbing gyms, this one is a large Treehouse.  Of all the ones we&#39;ve gone to, this one is the cleanest.  I&#39;m fortunate to be physically small enough to be able to follow my kids up into the treehouse (important since my 3yo has no issue climbing up, but wigs out once there and can&#39;t come back down...meaning I have to go in and rescue him).  And I&#39;ve actually seen the inside of this treehouse.  While it&#39;s sticky in some spots, overall, it&#39;s okay.  Maybe because it&#39;s a wider space than most of the other indoor gyms, staff are better able to wipe it down and clean it...but I know of other McD locations where I raced home to bathe my kids after seeing how filthy they&#39;d gotten coming out of the playplace (and now you have been forewarned of upcoming reviews).

Outside and around the treehouse they have other climbing things (tiger and lady bug? - if I remember correctly), and games, including arcade-like video games.  The floor is covered with soft rubber material - astroturf style.  The room is a good size, bigger than most and takes up half the restaurant.  It would be nice for bday parties.  We actually happened to come one day when there was a bday party going on and the kids looked like they were having a great time, and playing games including Bozo-or Ronald- buckets!  Though, they did attempt to hang a pinata from the treehouse which was promptly shut down by staff. lol.

They also have a separate kid-friendly bathroom in this section, perfect so that you don&#39;t have to go into the main restaurant, especially since the kids are only allowed to wear socks...speaking of which, I appreciate at times coming across staff who do a quick check of the room for either cleaning or making sure kids are wearing socks and not playing in their shoes or bare feet.  Socks can be purchased at the counter for $1.

Also, free Wi-Fi at this location, so it&#39;s nice to be able to surf on the iPad while the kids eat and play.  I&#39;ve seen many other parents do the same here.

So yes, we&#39;re here a lot, and plan to continue coming back so long as they maintain it!"

Edit: Bumped these guys to an easy four stars as they&#39;re now literally the only McDonald&#39;s I&#39;ve ever been to that can get my coffee order correct (Iced coffee without cream or sweetener).

Let&#39;s just say their quality of food and service has gotten poorer with every passing year. I can&#39;t speak for this year so far as I&#39;ve opted to never return here again. 

Let&#39;s start with food. If you&#39;re a person who has any instructions on the food you order, please STAY AWAY. They somehow find a way to even mess up regular food. Do not trust these people to accommodate your needs on special orders. You cannot have it your way or even McDonald&#39;s way. They have a special way here. A FRANCHISE way. Yes they are franchised and for that they have lower, no LOWEST standards. 

So avoid at all costs. Do not leave that window unless you check your food first. Even your drinks. They are 15% marked up due to being a franchise. Their food is always cold and stale. And their window operators dont even speak English. 

I really wish I can give 0 stars. 

I go to the McDonald 3 miles away on Schaumburg and weathersfield even though this is less than a stones throw from my house.

Thankfully they are opening a McDonalds on Golf (where Champs was) so between that place and the one on Roselle Rd. I can avoid this place.

DIRTY/OUTDATED
Place is seriously outdated for people who choose to eat inside. I&#39;m talking old school metal chairs, grandma floral decor, you name it.) If you tell the manager the tables are dirty, he just yells it&#39;s just dried up old white paint on them, not dirt. (Oh, Great!) I did notice a lot of broken machines.

NOISY
This again goes if you want to dine in. Between the loud screeches and incessant beeps of a broken machine, it makes this place super noisy to go to with a friend or have a conversation, let alone eat at.

FOOD
Standard menu. Got the correct portions. But the fries I got were hot, smelled slightly different and had barely any salt on them. Very bland.

LAYOUT
Genius move putting the only accessible door just after the curve of the drive through. Need to LOOK before you cross with the bushes there. If drivers aren&#39;t slowing down, paying attention or someone doesn&#39;t look before they cross, bad news.

Overall, they should demolish this place with the close proximity to nearby locations and the cost it would be to remodel/fix everything wrong with this location."

As I was looking at the menu trying to decide how I wanted to destroy my toilet he gets back on like 30 seconds later and said &#34;you ready yet&#34; I said okay okay I&#39;ll just have the egg white delight mcmuffin.  I didn&#39;t know he was in such a hurry to get me the F$%k out of there. Considering no one was behind me I could see how rushing me was necessary.  So I figured the transaction would be fast at the window.  However all I got at the window was &#34;hi.......$10.95&#34;.  Then the cashier continued talking to the order taker about his son and what they were going to do that day and how awesome it was to be them.  They didn&#39;t give a crap about me as long as they got my money!  I&#39;m so happy those 2 people work there they seem really close and it felt great being ignored!!!

The one thing that I would change about this location is the layout: the drive-thru lane crosses right over one of the main entrances (exits). So, you have to stop way short of the car you are following or you&#39;ll end up straddling the primary pedestrian crosswalk that navigates customers from the parking area. It can get a little awkward when a customer is walking out with their food and nearly open the door into the driver side door of your car and all you can do is sit there because you cars sandwiching you in.

In the case of this McDonald&#39;s, BIG MISTAKE! And stupid of me, I tried it for the third time... OMG... What&#39;s bad? Everything other than the location.


Menu (2/10)
It&#39;s McDonald&#39;s, so it&#39;s standard, right? As far as the menu list, yes. But if you look at what you get once you pay, blah! Yesterday was the third time I went there and I ordered a 3pc Chicken Select meal. The chicken was a half the size I normally get somewhere else. The fries was only 80% full. Two weeks ago, the chicken was 70% of normal size although the fries is full. The only consistency they have is every time I go there, I leave as a dissatisfied customer.

Price (2/10)
It&#39;s McDonald&#39;s. The price is pretty much set for each area. But that should get me the right portion for the meal I bought. Did I get it? No.

Ambiance (2/10)
Small and a little dirty. During summer, it&#39;s way too hot for comfort. They probably set the AC to 85 degree to lower cost. I haven&#39;t been there in winter and I don&#39;t think I plan to.

Service (1/10)
At McDonald&#39;s the only service I expect is to get my order done to my satisfaction. But with the way they cut the size of each portion, there&#39;s nothing else I can do but give them a 1.

Location (9/10)
It&#39;s about 5 minute drive from my office, so I don&#39;t have any complaint about the location.

Overall score: 3/10"

Also, I really do love the food but I just hate that guilty feeling afterwards like &#39;yep, just killed myself a little bit more...&#39; 

I always go through the drive-through, so I can&#39;t say anything about the inside but this is my typical experience... 
Pull up, there is always a second car in front, so I&#39;m at the #2 speaker. For the longest time I thought this was just a cardboard box painted and set up to look like a second speaker, but I was proven wrong a couple times ago when I actually heard a voice coming out of it. 

So I attempt to place my order (one or two items usually, nothing special), trying to shout over the cacophony I&#39;m hearing from the speaker, as if there is a grand symphony playing in the kitchen... 
Anyway, I usually have to repeat it several times since whoever told me they were taking my order was apparently joking and is paying me no attention whatsoever. 

I get my total and pull up to the window, and here is where the real annoyance starts. After a wordless, eye contact-less transaction (Seriously, not even a smile or a &#34;thank you&#34;! Is it because I don&#39;t speak Spanish? I feel discriminated against!), I sit there waiting for my food to be delivered. And sit there. 

After a few minutes one of the several people working the window rushes up and barks at me &#39;what are you waiting for?&#39; As in, what did I order. So I meekly tell them and they bark at me &#39;Next window!&#39; Okay, well thanks for telling me that... didn&#39;t know I was supposed to read your mind and know that instead of conveniently handing me my food right now since I&#39;m sitting right here, you just HAD to put it on that stupid conveyor belt and shoot it down to the next window. 

For some reason the people at the second window are a little more pleasant, maybe because they get to hang out in the back where it&#39;s much more quiet. I don&#39;t know. But once I get my order I rush off, vowing never to return... until the next time I have about 5 minutes to feed my belly. 

And here&#39;s an extra tidbit - don&#39;t try going here late night. Even though they say they&#39;re open 24 hours - I pulled up one night around midnight and there was already a car in front of me honking and trying to get someone&#39;s attention. I waited for a few minutes and then decided to try elsewhere. Who knows what they would have served by that point?!"

If you have the time to jump out of your car and run in then this McDonalds wont be a waste of your time, the drive through on the other hand is another story.  My order is not complicated; a mchicken with ketchup and a large drink.  For some reason whenever I go through the drive through this is always wrong (I&#39;ve received a big mac on more than one occasion).  Then the woman inside the window would argue with me about what I ordered...I know what I ordered thank you, it says on the receipt.  

The manager inside was very nice and professional and I&#39;ve never had these problems inside. As far as the drive through, not sure what&#39;s happening there but I would avoid it."

Today though I have to say that making breakfast at home certainly seems like a more logical and economical solution to my dilema.

I have been a regular here for the last two years. There is a blonde manager that if she is working the food is right. 

1. I ordered a fish filet no tarter. first attempt they wipe it off, 2nd there is a itsy bitsy drop in the very center of the sandwich. third time they get it right

2. ice cream cones. for get about it. inconsistancy in making of them and if you dont hold off and order at the window they are melting adn expect you to eat a melting cone. HELL NO!  remake time.

3. Today, line management for cars getting into the mcd&#39;s is stupid. just stupid. then i am told it will be a minute for my super special a sandwich minus cheese. HOLD THE ASSEMBY LINE!!!!! NO CHEEEEESE. fer christs sake. I mean what is so hard ... so I ask how long is a minute. It was a rhetorical question. he could just said about 60 seconds and i would have been fine, becuase the obvious 60=1 minute. so he cant give me a answer i drive off sans food. grumpy becuase of the exchange and was hoping to write a review .

I will try my best to never go back

PS the comment about getting blank stares if your lucky is so true

My complaint is for other things:
1. False advertisement: They advertised Transformer toy for Happy Meal in the restaurant and what my son received was Electro character from Spiderman from 6 MONTHS ago. When I complained, they said that&#39;s all they have. My son already have 3 of the same exact toy from 6 MONTHS ago.
2. Customer service: They messed up and they told us to just come back later to buy another happy meal when they have the Transformer toy. Talk about refusing to take responsibilities!
3. Corporate: Since I couldn&#39;t get resolution from the store, I escalated to corporate and all I received was a generic apology reply that was probably generated by a software. When I tried to reply to the email, they auto replied they didn&#39;t use the email address for communication. Talk about refusing to provide customer service!

This company has turned for the worst. One of the worst I&#39;ve experienced in my life. And it&#39;s particularly disturbing after I&#39;ve received so many great service from other companies like Starbucks, Chipotle, Taco Bell, Boston Market, etc."

As I entered the restaurant, the entrance (between the outside and inside doors) smelled HORRID. Then as I entered, it still smelled but not as strong. It was disgusting. I then had to wait 4 minutes until someone would take my order, there was no one in front of me. And another 4 minutes for my food. 

This is absolutely the worst service speed wise I have ever had at a McDonalds when there was no one in line in the restaurant (it was 3 pm...). And to top it off, when the one manager realized I was waiting, she yelled to the back of the store to get the cashier back up here. Yelling is very off putting..

The Fish Sandwich I had today was not as crispy as usual and had less tartar sauce than I would have liked but I was in a hurry and was not willing to wait another 4 minutes to get a sandwich. 

I did forget to get water, so I went back up only to have to stand at the counter another minute before someone acknowledged me. This was by far the worst meal I have had at a McDonald&#39;s to date.  

Also note the furniture, mind you this is a fairly newly remodeled place, is cracked and all beat up already."

Fast food check, inexpensive check, not really tasty probably. This is one of the more updated mcd locations with flat screen screens and has undergone multiple renovations.

I&#39;ve mentioned before that I usually don&#39;t like reviewing chains.  Especially McDonalds.  But my exceptions are if they have really good service or really bad service.  This particular location happens to be really, really, REALLY bad service. They get my order wrong 9 times out of 10 when I go here and the employees are just plain rude. I&#39;m don&#39;t get mad easily, but these people here really just get under my skin.

Example 1. I&#39;ll take a caramel latte and a nonfat vanilla latte.  Get to the window and she hands be something that says nonfat latte, when I brought this to her attention she said oh sorry its the wrong sticker thats the caramel one.  Okay, no big deal. But then the second one says that a vanilla latte, in which I told them it was supposed to be nonfat.  Again, wrong sticker but the young lady at the window tried arguing with me about what they really were.  She was really rude.  Upon leaving and drinking the coffees... the caramel one wasn&#39;t even close... it was a peppermint mocha!!!! Uhm really? You&#39;re going to argue with me over that and then its not even something we ordered. Cool. I&#39;ll give you a second chance....

Example 2. I go through the drive thru and order 3 burgers, 1 mcchicken, 2 small fries, and a coke.  I had to repeat my order 3 times at the speaker until the guy finally got it right.  Then I pay and pull up to the window and they ask me what my order was AGAIN. I tell them and wait another 5 minutes before my order gets to me.  I get home, my order is missing the mcchicken and the buffalo sauce I had asked for (and also paid for).  The girl here as also really rude to giving me attitude about anything I say or asked.  Come on people, I work in the food industry... its not that hard to get an order right! Especially when there&#39;s no one else inside or in the drive thru. 

What really baffles me at this location is how rude all of their employees are.  The customer service sucks monkey balls. There is no correcting them or saying you got the wrong item cause they&#39;ll just blame it on you.  Don&#39;t bother asking questions either, they won&#39;t answer them.  There&#39;s a McDonald&#39;s down the street from this one, that if you&#39;re from the area, is totally worth the extra couple blocks to drive as they almost always get my order right and their employees are super nice.

She left me &amp; my bike alone.

Stroller belong outside! Parents don&#39;t bother folding them out of the way so they&#39;re more of an obstruction to other customers than bicycles. How often do parents clean and wipe up biohazardous waste of toddler, pet dander and car trunk? Bicycles are better maintained, tuned up, registered and insured.

Two of us shared 3 of their appetizers:  Belly Buns (grilled Pork Belly...they were fantastic), Seafood Pancake (good but our least fave of the 3) &amp; the smaller-sized Dumplings (very good).  They give you 4 small bowls of various condiments/toppings as well and then certain dishes come with dipping sauce(s), too.  

TTOWA is a smaller place so you may have to wait for a table on busy Friday &amp; Saturday evenings.  We went for lunch on a Saturday and were seated right away as there were only 3 other tables taken at that time.  

I would have given them 5 stars if it weren&#39;t for 3 things: 
1. I ordered hot tea &amp; they bring you just a mug of hot tea...no small teapot like you get at some other places.  This in &amp; of itself is fine but my mug was never refilled and I finished it by the time we finished our first appetizer.  I could have asked but I waited to see if they would offer and they didn&#39;t so next time I&#39;ll know better.
2. When we ordered the smaller-sized Dumplings we ordered the Vegetable ones and we received the Meat ones...luckily we aren&#39;t vegetarians &amp; just ate them anyway since they were good.
3. Dumplings again...when we ordered we were not asked if we wanted them steamed or fried.  We should have specified when we ordered but since both options are listed on the menu the server should have asked.  The server hurried away before I realized he hadn&#39;t asked so we decided to just see what he would bring.  We received fried...of course we preferred steamed but like them both ways so again we just rolled with it and gobbled them up anyway."

Cons - service was spotty and at times odd.  They do not know how to serve wine.  They were friendly, just not well trained.

I was curious to check it out.   I&#39;ve never had Korean food before so I looked forward to the experience.

Service overall was friendly.    I was presented with Ttowa&#39;s Autumn Lunch Special menu.   They had quite a few tasty suggestions.    In the end I ordered the lunch special bibimbap with marinated ribeye.   I asked about the DOLSOT (hot stone) that was an extra $2 cost.   I was told that the hot stone helps in the preparation of the bibimbap making it cook easier.   Wanting to get the full Korean experience, I decided to go for it.    Prior to getting the bibimbap I was presented with five sampler appetizers on the house.    My faves among those were the potato salad and the miso-like soup.   

A second server that was working the kitchen area came out with my dish and she added a few spices and went to town mixing the bibimbap together.    Basically the egg yolk was cooked in to the rice, beef and other veggies that were in the bibimbap.    Between the appetizers and the meal, I was quite full.    The bibimbap was good though I found myself repeatedly needing to add some of the spices to it to give it more flavor.

Despite being full I wanted to try the complimentary donut dessert that was advertised on the yelp app.   Unfortunately though my lunch hour also was running over.   I asked if it was possible to come back after work to try it if I brang my receipt.   Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately...who needs the extra calories, right? LOL) I was told I&#39;d have to order it then and there and they wouldn&#39;t give it later (unless of course I order another entree at that time).  I understood but was still bummed.   Oh well.

Overall though I was impressed with my first Korean meal experience."

The wings are delicious. The spicy chicken is as good as everyone says. It&#39;s that kind of super moist, juicy, tasty and zingy chicken that I like best. 
I&#39;m never out here, but if I am, I&#39;ll make sure to return!"

Though Chinese and Japanese are more familiar amongst Americans, Korean food is usually a strange phenomenon. Fortunately, ttowa has mastered the introduction of Korean food in the American suburbs! With this, however, comes the disappointment of more Americanized Korean food for those that grew up with Korean food. 

The dumplings are great here, their speciality, and the texture and dough is delicious and chewy. We had the Sam gyup sal- which turned out to actually be dae ji bul go gi (spicy pork)- but still pretty good. The dolsot bibimbap (traditional stone bowl) is always my favorite though. They do it well here, despite the other more Americanized dishes. The banchan is also quite tasty and fresh, though very small in portions.

What also sets ttowa apart from other Korean restaurants is the excellent service. The family that runs this place know how to treat their customers- both non Koreans and Koreans. This is not usually the case at traditional Korean restaurants, so it&#39;s a nice refresher being treated well! The tea and dessert are always a plus!"

We LOVE this place already!! 

We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try, especially since it&#39;s pretty local to where we live. I really liked how it was a little further than the rest of the restaurants in Downtown Arlington Heights-- it made parking easier as well as the waiting time. 

Both times I&#39;ve been there, it was on a Friday night. There were already a few tables filled, but we were able to get seated right away on both occasions. The ambiance is nice: quiet, soft-lit, casual. 

On our first visit, we noticed they had a great drink selection. We were pleasantly surprised when we found out that they served 3 Floyds! Along with ordering to beers, we ordered the combo buns and an order to kalbi. The combo buns (belly &amp; dak buns) were a bit smaller than I expected, but they are so flavorful and savory that the bite-sized pieces were enough for the both of us! I really liked both-- I don&#39;t think I can choose a favorite between the two. 

What my favorite part about this place is that we were able to get Korean BBQ, without doing the actual BBQ&#39;ing (not a fan of all the smoke that tends to fog the room up when doing KBBQ). The kalbi was DELICIOUS. The portions were very generous and the sauce was more than perfect. The banchan it was served with were tasty. The portions were a bit small but it wasn&#39;t a problem when asking for more. The entree also came with two small bowls of rice, which is always a plus. 

As mentioned before, we came back again a week later and ordered the kalbi again (we&#39;re obsessed) and black bean noodles with shrimp tempura. The black bean noodles might be a newer addition to the menu, but it was good! It came in a very large bowl and you can tell that the noodles are handmade. Wish it came in spicy.

As far as service, Terry is very welcoming and attentive. Our first server was great! We had a different server on our second visit, we had to ask for things a few times but service overall was still good. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, especially to those who might be new to Korean food!"

For appetizer had the belly and chicken bun combo. Nice appetizer size and the meat had good flavor. I preferred the pork belly over the chicken. Really enjoyed the lollipop chicken wings. The sauce was spicy and sticky.

For entree shared with the table bulgogi, sam gyup sal, and kalbi. The sam gyup sal had good texture and the brussell sprouts was an interesting addition. The kalbi was cooked well however, I thought the sauce was a little too sweet. Bulgogi was tasty.

I&#39;ve had more authentic Korean at other places but overall I found the food to be flavorful and enjoyed my meal. Service was great!"

The food is SO good we ordered double so we have leftovers for a few days. We&#39;re farther out and don&#39;t have any Korean places by us. Accidentally got a double appetizer, but hey that can be lunch. The place was packed (rightfully so). 

The prices seem steep, but in relation to the serving sizes are quite fair. The individual order of dak galbi&#39;s is easily split into 3 servings. 

On request were also given sesame leaves, lettuce, and ssamjjang so we can make wraps for variety. Their ssaamjjang is great, as is their Kimchi. 

Definitely recommend, the gent I believe is the owner is really nice too. 

Definitely want to come back on a slower day and try their Bossam, until next time!"

This is another review that&#39;s long overdue.  When we have a craving for Korean food in the area, Ttowa immediately comes to mind.  It&#39;s not an old school Korean joint, but the twists to the familiar Korean fare make for a great eating experience!  The friendly service makes this even more of a destination.  While the food is a bit overpriced, we always look forward to heading to downtown Arlington Heights for a delicious meal at Ttowa.

The standouts here include the Belly Bun, kalbi (short ribs), and the black bean noodles with crispy shrimp.  There&#39;s also a lot of love for the crispy eggplant banchan with the sweet sauce on top.  The Belly Bun (it comes with 4 pieces) is so delicious.  The pork belly has a pronounced grilled flavor and is complimented nicely by the pickled cucumber and sweet soy sauce.  The kalbi is prepared well and has a nice sweetness that you would expect from this Korean BBQ short rib dish.  Jajangmyeon (black bean noodles) is one of my favorite Korean dishes, and there&#39;s a version here as a special with crispy fried shrimp that&#39;s simply awesome.  And don&#39;t skip those chicken wings!  The spicy seafood rice cakes though we&#39;re just alright; the mussels and clams were very small.  Ttowa does have a nice beer list so make sure to grab a cold one while you&#39;re here.

The owners are friendly so the good service is no surprise.  The prices though are high for the portion sizes so it&#39;s easy to rack up a sizable bill.  Nevertheless, we&#39;ll keep coming here for the excellent food and service."

We love their belly buns and jumbo dumplings for apps. We always get a bibimbap bowl to share and then usually another entree. The short ribs and pork belly with Brussels sprouts are both great.

7pm dinner on a Saturday night and we were the only Asian customers in the whole place.  Every table was full plus a ton of people waiting for tables but again none were Asian.  After tasting the food I realized why.

The menu lists all the traditional Korean items but didn&#39;t taste like anything traditional.  All the dishes we had were very westernized.  Too sweet and too salty.

Potstickers were way too crunchy.  Don&#39;t know if it was overcooked or if they were suppose to be like that.  My kids would like the crunch tho!  The flavors inside were ok.  Liked that they had tofu n mushrooms in them that I can see n taste!!  Tried the veggie n meat but liked the veggie better.  Soy n Siracha as dipping sauces.  Nothing special.  None of their sauces were anything special.  All straight out of a bottle.  They probably know that they can get away with that with their clientele.  

Spicy chicken was ok but it was just chicken.  Not even any onions grilled with it.  But my friends seem to like it.  It&#39;s just not what I&#39;m use to.

Big platter of bossam (pork belly wraps) pork belly itself was good.  But the accompaniments were way off.  No napa cabbage but red leaf lettuce.  A weird bean paste sauce...runny n sweet n this powder (which is normally a bean powder for rice cake) was on the platter.  What were we suppose to do with that?   Radish topping was so thin n broken that it looked like scraps of leftovers. 

There were 8 of us and we ordered a million things from the menu but the stars are for the veggie potstickers, the plain pork belly AND serious kudos to a Korean restaurant that does amazing business with a majority of none-Asian clients!!  

But if you are looking for traditional Korean, this isn&#39;t it.
I&#39;m not gonna write it off totally yet.  Maybe I ordered the wrong things or went on a off day."

The staff was courteous and nice atmosphere. I&#39;ve been craving the lollipop chicken appetizers since we went. It was a little more expensive than places in Chicago, but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s due to  location. Downside is we had to drive around looking for parking, then walk a few blocks. Will definitely go back when I can splurge. We ordered 3 appetizers and one meal, drank water and the bill with the tip came out over $75"

This particular restaurant is  few blocks away from Arlington Heights metra station,and seemed very quite popular.  I was quite happy to learn there was no wait at the time. We were quickly served Banchan pretty much right after we placed the orders. They were pretty good nothing really stood out though .

The Server was very descriptive when we mentioned some of us are vegetarians and he pretty much pointed out every dish on the menu that can be made vegetarian.

He insisted us to try the Dduk BokKi which were spicy rice cakes in some sauce. This was one of the best korean starters that I have had before. I would really recommend people to try the Dduk Bokki. We tried the chicken buns which seemed very popular in reviews. Tasted excellent but were kind of tiny .

For the Korean main course Bibimbap is my choice.They offer  (Dolost Bibimbap) for 2$ extra. And i would recommend the dolsot which comes in hot stonepot.

A bit more expensive for the offerings and portions but overall its a solid korean spot for suburbs. 

Service was quite good as we didn&#39;t have much trouble getting attention of the wait staff. Although it wasn&#39;t quite packed while we were eating so I would certainly think during peak times service might suffer some more.

Tip: For a yelp check -in you get a free korean dessert which contains 2 korean donuts with two scoops of Green tea and Red bean icecream . Must try !!!"

The young owner host is still as friendly as ever and showed me his craft beer list and it is surprisingly quite good.

- Spicy pork and chives with steam buns appetizer
- Pork belly lettuce wraps (for two)
- Bulgogi
- Grilled beef short ribs, with a unique bacon kimchi stew (nice BBQ like flavor from the bacon)

The beef short ribs were a highlight - excellently marinated and quite large.  We found the pork belly for the lettuce wraps to be a little on dry side, but overall a very nice dinner, and you really can&#39;t go wrong on any of the dishes and their flavors here."

For the appetiser we got the half pork belly buns and half the chicken buns. Once they arrived they didn&#39;t last gone and were gone in about 2 minutes. They are so delicious. There is so much flavour. You can&#39;t go wrong choosing either one. Or split it half and half like we did! They serve you 4 buns. Depending if you get the chicken buns it&#39;s $10 and the pork belly are $12. If you love these and you wanted to keep eating them, then you need to order this next....


Today I decided to get the Spicy Chive Pork with 10 buns. It is $19 so if you feel like splurging a little get this. It is super delicious. They give you enough filling to fill every single bun fully and still have more filling left over. The buns are super soft and easy to hold to put the filling into. It is a very filling dish. They weren&#39;t stingy on the pork filling so I ended up taking some home. This is another reason I love Ttowa, lots of places like to be stingy and not give you enough but they exceeded that. They give you plenty to eat.  I highly recommend this dish. You will be very satisfied. Everything was cooked well and couldn&#39;t fault this dish one bit. You won&#39;t regret it!"

It&#39;s not your typical Korean bbq where you cook it yourself, which can be hit or miss. It&#39;s also not Korean bar food. It&#39;s more like Korean fine dining but I&#39;m not very classy when I go - I order pretty much the whole menu every time I go and eat like a pig. I bring people here all the time and without fail, everyone has loved it and been back. And I&#39;m such a great influence, they only know how to order like I do - one of everything! No joke, I&#39;ve had everything on the menu including their specials (that&#39;s how often I go) and I&#39;ve not been disappointed once. If you&#39;re a beginner, try the chicken wings or seafood pancake for an appetizer and the beef or chicken bimimbop as your entree. Order a bottle of wine with that and you&#39;re all set!"

The restaurant was very clean and the ambience was very relaxing, we were the only ones in the place which was surprising. We started off with asian pancakes which was delicious (always a hit for my non-asian friends) and she also enjoyed the side dishes. There was a nice selection, but nothing out of the ordinary for a Korean restaurant.

The food was also very tasty too. She enjoyed her soup ($13) and I enjoyed my bim bim bop ($10), I do wish there was a lunch special though. Overall, TTOWA was a solid and enjoyable lunch! It didn&#39;t blow me out of the water, but the prices matched the food quality and service."

I have no idea why the restaurant consists of five letters, and I don&#39;t really know why they haven&#39;t updated their online menu recently (at least for lunch specials). So I went for the fallback option, which was bibimbap. 

I really liked it. Nicely marinated steak, perfectly fried egg. All of the vegetables were consistently cut, and the portion size was quite a bit for less than $10. The white rice was perfectly cooked and chopstick-friendly. 

I think what stood out to me was the sauce that comes with the bibimbap. Not being Korean, unfortunately I have no idea what&#39;s in it. I do know that it&#39;s incredibly flavorful and a different kind of spicy without being hot, which helps bring together everything else in the dish.  I was also a fan of the miso soup on the side. 

I&#39;m looking forward to exploring some more of TTOWA&#39;s menu!"

The food was not good at all and the service was even worse. Honestly, I&#39;m really not sure why the waiter completely ignored us when he was super nice and welcoming to every other table around us. We heard him generously offer to refill the banchan for the table next to us while we sat there with our banchan plates also empty... It took him forever to even bring out the banchan while it seemed like everyone else got theirs immediately after they ordered. It took him forever to take our order. We all felt incredibly unwelcome.

The food was pretty meh. The banchan was just weird and incredibly unauthentic. The food was marginally better but this place is definitely not authentic at all. We also got the free donuts with the yelp check in and for some weird reason the donut was cut into tiny little scraps? It was really confusing.

I definitely do not see myself ever returning here."

The service is good and it&#39;s a pretty low key spot which I liked. Parking is a bit tough at night but we drove around a little bit and found something.
What we got:
- Chicken wings- good but not amazing. They are super small!
- Bite sized dumplings- pretty good but next time I want to try the buns
- Pork belly dish- good, a bit spicey!
- Bulgogi- tasty but I&#39;ve had better
- BBQ ribs and bacon kimchi stew- LOVED the ribs. I would come back for these. The stew was an interesting flavor. I liked it but couldn&#39;t eat that much of it.
- All the side dishes- I liked the fusiony dishes like the little fried dishes and broccoli with aoli. I&#39;m not sure on kimchi but that&#39;s just me,

We got the free dessert with the Yelp check in which was good but didn&#39;t blow my mind. It was nice that it came with two scoops of ice cream also!"

I got the dakkalguksu or what they called chicken noodle soup, which was a little on the bland side. My bf got the soondubu which was okay not anything super exceptional.

First Arlington Heights downtown is like the best parts I like about Chicago, minus the dirt, homeless and crazy young college kids. Sadly no hipsters in AH.

I have had Korean BBQ only once before at a martial arts picnic, cooked by the Korean Masters. Was tasty so I was looking forward to it. 

The place is cozy, small and feels homey. I like that. The food was a bit more expensive then I expected, but the saving grace was the complimentary coffee after the meal!

Apparently some Korean BBQ have grills in the table to cook the meat, so my partner said. This place did not. So if you are looking for that bit of showmanship, this is not the place.

I had the BBQ pork back, simply because well its pork back come on. I wanted to experiment. 

When my dish arrived at first I thought, no way can I eat that much. Was I wrong, if I could have licked the hot plate I would.  I used the rice to soak up all the yummy sauce! The pork back, I had feared may be chewy like uncooked bacon. Not so, it was crispy, meaty and perfect.

My lunch partner had the bbq chicken, which looked like chicken wings but was not. She said it was good and only mildly spicy.

Then the complimentary coffee. This really made me happy. I was &#34;surprised and delighted&#34; They said it was Korean coffee, and I never knew there was such a thing. The glasses it came in looked so cool, elevated it. We asked what the coffee was and they brought us a sample. It was an instant brand, with some honey sweeter.  Sort of took the mystery out of it, but it was great. 

And do check in and get the free donut dessert. The description does not do it justice. It comes with green tea ice cream and some other flavor. The warm bits of donut were great!

All in all, great. I would give it 5 starts, but the prices were a touch high. Highly recommended!"

With that being said, I agree with a lot of the 5 star reviews on here. The food is delicious and it&#39;s a GREAT way for people to try Korean food. However, it&#39;s a bit of a twist on authentic Korean food. It&#39;s not fusion, but it&#39;s a little Americanized. I think if people tried the dishes at its fullest authenticity, it would be on the Travel Channel&#39;s Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern. Especially if this is your first time trying Korean food. Anyway, on to my review.

SERVICE: I&#39;m actually pretty torn, because the servers are really really nice and you can tell that the owner really cares about providing awesome, attentive service. There were actually a few issues, which he personally came to apologize for and rectify. For instance, since we were quoted 30 minute wait time for dinner, but we actually waited close to 45 minutes, he offered us complimentary dumplings. Free food? Hell yeah, I&#39;m OK with that! But the servers were way too busy and all over the place that they forgot to put in one of our orders and also forgot to bring us new bowls of rice for us to eat with our other dishes. I mean, come on, Koreans gotta have their rice in their meal. It&#39;s just a given."

My husband and I have come here twice now in the last month  and both food and service are top notch! Servers are very attentive to the tables. We love their steamed bun appetizers, especially the belly buns, such a unique flavor plus they give you tons of meat.  Their pork dumplings are also amazing.  They bring out little dishes of different side items too, we love the cucumbers and eggplant chips (they might be zucchini.. I don&#39;t know but they are delicious!)

For entrees, the Dak kalbi (spicy chicken) is my favorite so far, also tried sweet and sour chicken special last time, both dishes the meat was so tender and flavorful. My husband got the bibimbap with the spicy pork in a hot stone bowl which was pretty cool too, as he was eating it the rice continued to cook and got a crispy texture to it. The spicy stuff is definitely spicy so beware in case you don&#39;t like super hot but it is SO good.

Definitely our new favorite place! They also have a pretty decent craft beer selection :)"

The host seemed like he was totally overwhelmed but promised to call us when our table was ready. 45 minutes later, we were seated.

We had an assortment of dumplings, the scallion pancake, and the bibimbop for a main (they were kind enough to put the hot sauce on the side for me). My brother- and sister-in-law had the pork belly. I love that the pork belly came with these tiny side dishes you could try, each with its own flavor.

We unlocked the free dessert option, so we also got a heaping portion of green tea and red tea(?) ice cream and a bready-date dessert &#34;donut.&#34;

They thought that they took too long giving us our check--they didn&#39;t at all--and so they gave us a free bottle of sake! Totally unnecessary but very kind of them, and we drank it all.

The food here was really top notch. I enjoyed every dish. I wouldn&#39;t expect something this good in the burbs, and I&#39;ll definitely be back."

It&#39;s a pork dish, commonly served in Korean restaurants/bars but the way they prepare it is out of this world! It is on the pricey side and it&#39;s a lot of food (it&#39;s meant to be shared). But I can&#39;t help needing to go get this on a regular basis. It comes with either lettuce and perilla leaves () that you can wrap the pork in and place different toppings. Sorry my description doesn&#39;t do it justice so I&#39;ll post a pic!

I&#39;ve been here numerous times before. And their dishes are good. Try the seafood ddukbokgee - and ask them to make it into a fried rice at the end after it&#39;s done. They are also known for their chicken galbi as well. 

True it&#39;s not a &#34;authentic&#34; Korean restaurant. It has some fusion elements to it, but I say it&#39;s unique Korean dishes (like the seafood ddukbokgee). They don&#39;t give you a lot of side dishes (like sansoo, but who cares?) but you can always ask for more. Personally, I prefer the uniqueness of Ttowa over any other cookie cutter Korean restaurant. 

The ambiance, food, service and all around good times at Ttowa makes you want to return multiple times. I can tell others feel that way too as the owner greeted several regulars while I was there. Ttowa in Korean means &#34;to come back...&#34; And I can&#39;t think of a more appropriate name for this place."

I started with a glass of wine, and followed it with a shot of chum churum amongst the fellow yelpers I was dining with. Now if that&#39;s not a festive way to start a meal, I don&#39;t know what is!

(Note: They are no longer a BYOB establishment, but they do have a great drink menu!)

I started with indulgences like dumplings and panchan, then was served an array of sides like kimchee, raw broccoli with a red sauce, apple salad, and beef pancakes. All new to my palate and all delicious!

For my meal I went with the spicy chive pork with steamed buns. If you love spicy, flavorful food - this option is for you! Not only are the buns little nuggets from heaven, but the pork mixture is to die for. It is definitely spicy, so make sure you&#39;re up for it :)

All of the buns were great, the appetizers were tasty, and the vegetarian dishes hit the spot like I never would have expected.  The 6 small sides that come with the meal are each tasty and fantastic compliments to the main dishes.

I ordered the Ojingeo (sizzling squid) and it was fantastic, but after trying a bite of a fellow Yelper&#39;s sizzling pork belly I felt like I should order more to go!  I&#39;m a sucker for all forms of bacon, but this was way up there in my books.

The Bibimbab looked fantastic as well, and - as the name implies, mixed right in.  Worth getting next time around for a simple, but well balanced flavor.

We had doughnuts and ice cream for desert as well, and I must say this is the only time I&#39;ve ever liked green tea ice cream - a great accomplishment for TTOWA.  The doughnuts were great also, and it made for a nice dessert that wasn&#39;t too heavy.

The soft buns, are more like Russian ladushki, or little savory blini&#39;s, and served stuffed with deliciously flavored meat, fermented chili sauce has never been better. The rice cakes are crispy and creamy at the same time, like gnocchi. For our main we shared the pork belly wraps, which I swear I tasted bits of buttery cinnamon!  Divine!!!!! Go there."

Anytime I have bossam in the future, I will now expect it to be done similar to TTOWA.  So I guess if I have a craving for bossam, I&#39;ll be going here.  Please direct me otherwise if my experience is lacking.

Soup was meh with my fiancee describing it as &#34;not-korean&#34; tasting enough.  She ordered a &#34;spicy&#34; soup requesting hot sauce.  Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t have the standard fare to spice it up.  They seriously only added a single drop of concentrated hot sauce per her request...yea, she ended up unable to eat it at that point, lol.

Service:  So I put in a reservation for 730, but when I get there, they couldn&#39;t get me a table until 8 - ended up sitting at the bar in a terrible spot (where server traffics exit in/out).  I would have docked a star here, but their service policies excelled.  Okay okay, truthfully, they bought me off with free food (2 appetizers)."

Ttowa is one of my absolute faves. I honestly can&#39;t say enough good things about it. Terri, the owner, treats us like family and greets our 3 years old twins like he&#39;s actually happy to see them, which if I&#39;m being honest, they probably don&#39;t deserve as they are very messy eaters and not the most well behaved patrons. Despite that, my toddlers LOVE the food and we do too!

There are so many things we love on the menu and we rarely miss an opportunity to order all our favorites. Our typical meal starts with an order of Duk Bun, perfectly balanced Korean tacos (for lack of a better work) and Duk Bokki, spicy and crispy on the outside just the way I like it. I&#39;ve ordered Duk Bokki at a bunch of other places and while it might not be exactly traditionally prepared at Ttowa it is elevated to a level of deliciousness not found elsewhere. We always get one to share and my oldest son gets an extra for his entree. 

Today I had the seafood and pork noodle soup. Savory, spicy broth and super tasty homemade noodles. My husband was feeling a little under the weather so he had his go to Kimchee Jiggae, like momma makes. The twins shared the Bulgogi. My little man, who I can barely get to eat a chicken nugget, would eat Bulgogi for breakfast, lunch and dinner. My daughter, who is a little more adventurous, loves the Banchan, small dishes of various pickled veggies, carmelized eggplant, kimchee, etc. Kimchee is her favorite! 

If you haven&#39;t tried Ttowa yet, you must, like now, get in your car and drive there. You won&#39;t regret it."

We enjoyed everything from soup to nuts (or the Korean equivalent). Much of what we had was new to me. I really enjoy going to Korean restaurants - the food is exotic; the side dishes are wonderful. Ttowa in particular was great - the owner served us; he gave us a number of drinks and dishes to try on the house. The food was spectacular.

I plan to return to experience Ttowa with my family soon."

Location and Ambiance:

Food:
The food was fantastic! Its small plate style and they have a unique twist on everything!

Staff:
The staff was extremely nice and knowledgeable of all their foods!

In summary, probably one of the best restaurants in Illinois as a whole!

Menu is fantastic. I almost always get the dak buns to share with the table, then the kalbi short ribs in their addictive sauce... heaven. The little bowls with side dishes are always a nice compliment to my (inevitably) meat-heavy meal. Ask the super patient and friendly servers to identify them if you&#39;re uncertain. The beer list is great too - they even have my FAVORITE beer on tap, Off Color&#39;s Apex Predator, which pairs very well with the cuisine. Wish I could eat here every day!"

Simply put, if I had the same service on my first visit, there would not have been a second visit.

Service was extremely slow - from being seated to leaving took over an hour and a half.  It would have been even longer if I hadn&#39;t grown tired of waiting for our server to return to our table to close our check and process my charge card since he was chatting with a table full of people and not noticing me sitting there trying to get his attention.

But, on to the good stuff...THE FOOD!  Everything we had was delicious (with the exception of the egg on the bibimbab - the yolk was completely cooked through and was not runny at all - quite the disappointment.  But it was more than outweighed by the delicious stuff, Dak Bun, dumplings and the appetizer rice cake.  

I loved the food both times and will return, hoping that the service I experienced the second time is the exception and not the standard."

The place was tiny but quaint and it&#39;s kinda tucked in between buildings. I barely noticed it. However, it&#39;s packed on a Friday night. We had to delay our reservation due to the wonderfully amazing Chicago traffic; and we had to wait about 15 minutes when we got there as they were maxed out.

We ordered tons of foods from grilled spicy  squids in hot plate, the seafood pancake aja paejun, the chap gae, dol bukki, jamboong or noodles in spicy broth with seafood and pork. Everything was very very tasty! I also loved the fact that we could eat Korean BBQ without getting stinky like smoke. I loveeeee that!! 

The owner and his crew worked their ass off to service all the tables. They&#39;re busy but they didn&#39;t skip a beat. They only thing I wish they would do better is the little side dishes. I wish they give more each and have more varieties. 

I redeemed a Yelp check in offer of free donuts and they did that with a smile and the donut was yummy. 

Not sure what Ttowa means and why they need two Ts for Ttowa. Maybe it was the same thing like if I would describe Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead. HOTT. It just seems that one T isn&#39;t enough."

The food took a really, really, long time, so the waiter offered us some complimentary drinks, which I thought was a nice touch.  My only complaint was that the kimchi jigae and the budae jigae were extremely similar.  I normally expect spam in budae jigae, which I am not a fan of, but this version didn&#39;t have spam.  I kind of wish I would have ordered something more different than what my husband got, but oh well. Definitely go for the budae jigae if you are debating between the two.

We moved into the area yesterday and they were recommending other local joints to check out.  My husband ordered the Dak kalbi and he was blown away.  Even non-adventurous eaters will love it.  I ordered the bibimbop.  I was looking forward to the crispy rice crust you get when it&#39;s served in a hot stone bowl, so I was a little sad that they don&#39;t serve it in one, but it was super tasty and the waitress made it the perfect level of spicy after asking me how I preferred it.  To top it off, we got the cinnamon donuts/ice cream dessert and our spoons were scraping the plate even when nothing was left to the eye.

I was ready to be overwhelmed with a table full of banchan (side dishes),  big bowl of rice all from ordering one dish - typical Korean style.

But... it&#39;s not and that&#39;s OK. FYI, banchan count is 6.

Ttowa threw me off a bit. It&#39;s been on my list to try as I&#39;m exploring Korean food. Most of the time, it&#39;s so spicy I can barely taste anything or it&#39;s incredibly simple, it&#39;s virtuously tasteless. Here, the food was surprisingly well balanced and perfect for the Korean newbie. Plenty of flavors like kimchi, seafood, gochujang, black bean, but not overwhelmingly spicy or stinky. Really enjoyed the dak bun, beef bulgogi and seafood soup. The soup consisted of squid, mussels, clams, shrimp and noodles was my favorite, unfortunately, the actual name on the menu surpasses me. It&#39;s in the upper left corner of the menu, not hard to figure out. I was worried it would be super spicy and the owner psyched me out on the spiciness, but you know what, it was really perfect for me.

If anything, I would recommend this place for Korean foodie newbies to start here simply because the staff, the family service, is friendly and very helpful, not the angry ajumma pushing dishes around, although having the local experience makes things taste and feel authentic. Another time and place for that..."

So we kinda pigged out, hey it was girls night! So we got pork tacos- recommended by the Chef- it was perfect, they had vegetarian dumplings which also was great along with complimentary rice balls- this was one of my favorites! It was spicy and full of flavor with a great texture. 

The host talked be out of my bulogogi to a Chicken BBQ, he promised it would not disappoint and he was right! My friend who is a regular there got a BimBoBop with tofu, she enjoyed it without surprise.

My first red flag was there were only 2 tables that actually had Asian patrons.  Let&#39;s face it.... When it comes to ethnic restaurants, it&#39;s a great sign when you see that ethnic group also eating there.

But let&#39;s get to the food...I found it kinda strange that the Bibimbop was served cold.  When we inquired about it, they said that&#39;s not how it should be served &amp; then kindly brought out another.  However that too was cold.  In fact, colder than the first.  Then a different server said that it becomes cold from the fresh vegetables in it.  But my question then is why isn&#39;t the rice, chicken &amp; egg warm then?  I think bibimbop is traditionally served in a stone bowl that comes out sizzling.  The rice on the bottom gets deliciously crispy... And theirs had none of that.

Bulgogi is marinated grilled shortribs.  Sometimes at Korean restaurants you could cook it yourself at the table--fun to do with large groups.  This was not one of those places.  No big deal!  I&#39;d rather have someone cook it for me anyway.  It was tasty but was very very small.  Lots of bones &amp; not enough meat.  It seemed they were aware of this because the ones on the bottom has almost no meat.  As if they were hiding it by placing on the bottom. 

Panchan are lovely side dishes that you eat either before the meal or after the main entree is served.  Usually when we go to Korean restaurants, they start to overtake the table in a wonderful foodie way!  I&#39;m talking 25+ little dishes with various yummy things in them like Kim chi and pickled radishes.  At TTOWA, all we got were 5 little dishes to share at our table of 4.  I was really bummed!  The sides were barely even Korean.  1 was 3 bits of steamed broccoli, another was potato salad.

I so badly wanted a great Korean restaurant in the suburbs and was disappointed at how westernized this restaurant tasted."

I will say that I found my new favorite Korean barbecue place after eating there last night.
They brought out the best kimchi that I have ever eaten they had this candied eggplant that was great and my favorite dish was better here than I&#39;ve ever had it.
The only bad thing was the soup that comes with dinner was room temperature at best and had really no flavor very bland.

My main was the seafood paella, and it came with a ginormous lobster tail that was sweet and delicious.  The mussels were tiny but tasted good.  The sea bass and scallops and chorizo were only so-so.

The filet mignon, salmon, steak flat bread and all of the happy hour dishes were superb. The lamb chops and scallops required a second order for each item - both were that good! The presentation makes each dish and dessert alluring, especially the scallops served on a shell with sea salt.

I like feeling as if I&#39;m still eating somewhat healthy while traveling. It&#39;s been a couple years since my last visit and I don&#39;t remember the interior being so dark. I would have preferred a bit brighter lighting. I was seated in a booth near the bar and enjoyed the live music which was a nice touch for a Wednesday night. Overall the service was fine, and I thought my server found a good balance between being attentive but not overly intrusive which I really appreciated.

I ordered the wood-grilled pork tenderloin which came with a sweet potato mash, sauté of bacon, spring vegetables and zesty jus. I also ordered the caramelized sea scallops as an accompaniment. (Gotta take advantage of traveling on an expense account, haha.) There were four scallops served on a skewer over a melted lemon butter sauce. The lemon flavor was a bit strong, but overall the scallops were well-cooked and I enjoyed them. The pork tenderloin was slightly on the dry side. I would have liked more of the jus, which was good although not particularly zesty. Maybe this is a result of eating out so much lately, but my favorite part of the meal was the sweet potato mash and the spring vegetables. They were well seasoned and the vegetables tasted very fresh.

The seafood dishes come in salads, sandwiches, and entrees.  They also offer a wide variety different flatbreads as well.  One nice feature on the menu is the &#39;calorie&#39; counter for each item on the menu.  Helps you make better selections.

I had the lump crab wedge salad and found it to be really good.  Could have used a tad less zesty mustard dressing as I felt it took away from the crab flavor, but that is just my preference.  The better have had the crab cake sandwich and she enjoyed it.  Her sandwich also had the zesty mustard dressing and she really liked it.  

Though I did not partake in any adult beverages, but I did run through the wine menu.  The wine menu was put together extremely well, very impressive.  Great lay-out, explanation and selection of wines.  The list offers winery names that are not widely heard of, which I love.  The prices were extremely reasonable for bottles.  

I would certainly hit up this place for lunch or dinner any time and will definitely run through the wine list.  Healthy eats, friendly enough service and a great eclectic wine list make this place worth coming too."

The great reviews definitely speak to their quality, taste, and service. My husband and I had the pleasure of trying their &#39;lobster &amp; fresh mozzarella flatbread&#39;, &#39;asian-glazed chilean sea bass entree&#39;, &#39;wood-grilled filet mignon&#39;, and the wine flights. All were made to perfection! The sea bass was a tad bit bland in my opinion (usually I think everything is too heavy or salty), but oh man... that bass was silky smooth.

Make sure to ask for the happy hour menu (or the &#39;flights and flatbread&#39; menu) as they are offered everyday until 6:30PM. They didn&#39;t bring this menu to us until we had asked. The wine flights are definitely worth it (unless you already have your absolute favorite wine to try). They bring you 3 flights and you get to pick your favorite wine (out of the three) for a full glass! What a steal!"

I Admire their mission and what they are going for with trying new things every week. However, it is extremely expensive and one should be ready to spend a lot of money.

I am happy we decided to eat here, it&#39;s a really cool place with good ambience. Only reason for not awarding 5 stars was the service. A little bit slow but they were super busy.

We started with a gin rickey and a glass of malbec, followed by scrumptious appetizers. The pesto chicken flatbread was mouth watering and amazing. The lump crabcake was also delicious although a little on the small side. We decided to go light on the entrees! I had the flat iron steak salad which did not disappoint. Steak cooked medium and a good sized bed of salad. My wife had the grilled salmon salad which was really tasty and super fresh fish.

Will be back soon to try more off the realy good looking menu!"

You get a sufficient taste of a dish without getting halfway through and wondering if you should push on and finish it, or stop and take it home for leftovers.  The vegetables are fresh, the sauces are not overbearing and, if you&#39;ve looked at any of the pictures for this place, you can see their desserts come in oversized shot glasses.  It&#39;s enough for a few bites and they are the perfect sweet complement to your dinner.  

I don&#39;t go there often enough.  I should stop in sometime just for a drink and to enjoy the bar&#39;s piano player,or even just to be bad and make a meal out of a group of their desserts!"

We were greeted right away, treated very well, and served with the upmost quality. Though my dad&#39;s filet mignon, which he usually loves at this spot, tasted a little too salty that night, our server took it back and took it off the bill, as all nicer restaurants should do. Other than this mishap, we had a great experience. The ambience is intimate and elegant, with dim lights and beautiful decorations. Wine selections are great here also. 

As for food, I really like how the menu is seasonal. It really makes me feel like I&#39;m eating the freshest of foods. Brussel sprouts were pretty tasty and crispy. Salmon was excellently prepared. The second filet mignon dish that came out (the non salty one) was also excellent and flavorful. 

Overall, we had an amazing experience here and would love to be back! Only downsides are that it can get really crowded, and you will probably need to get valet parking!"

We got there on a Saturday night around 6:30 and were told the wait for a table was until about 8:45 but there was open seating in the bar area. We had a number of options to pick from there and we saddled up the bar and ordered a couple of glasses of wine. They have a very good wine selection that is fairly priced, and we got our pours quickly and placed our food order.

If you sit at the bar there is a piano player there, so you can enjoy some live music while you wait. Our food came out quickly and it was exceptionally tasty and just as described. We got a steak flatbread, white chili, and field greens salad. There are a number of things I like about the menu and the food - the items are reasonably sized, they control the calories by adding a nice combination to make it tasty without going overboard with sauces and other high-calorie items, the food is very fresh and flavorful (and you can taste it since it&#39;s not drowned out), and  there are a lot of options.

We topped it off with a couple of &#39;shooters&#39; of desert - again, a nice-sized portion that has great flavor without being over the top.

They have free valet parking, and the parking lot was very full when we arrived and when we left, but there were seating options available the whole time."

Got lucky, family of 4 got seated by the bar. It was nice to a see a female piano player/singer as entertainment. she sort of reminded me of Sarah Bareilles, yes, she had that kind of voice.
husband was looking for fish and there&#39;s not of places in the NW suburbs that would cater to that, aside from it being fried.  
our server gave us a lot of time to decide, more than we needed to. Husband had the cedar plank roasted salmon, he really liked the roasted veggies. Daughter and myself that flatbread and son had the maui tuna crunch salad.  With a son who eats a lot, he ordered pepperoni flatbread. We were satisfied with what we had and we even ordered desserts which we usually don&#39;t.
Desserts came in a plate and you had to select what you want.  I had the creme brulee which wasn&#39;t that sweet which I liked.
Any opportunity to come back here again, I will."

The evening did not start out well, as our server brought water and then disappeared. My boyfriend and I discussed who would say something - as I knew that it would just result in us getting upset and ruining the evening. The service manager was on duty, and took care of everything- including the ENTIRE meal!

Our server came over, explained she&#39;d been slammed, but that it was NO excuse. That we were celebrating a special evening, and it was our first time there. She went out of her way to make sure that our meal was amazing, and more than made up for everything had happened. 

We asked that they charge us for SOMETHING, and she asked why, and I said &#34;Because neither one of us have any cash.....&#34; and she realized that what we were saying is that we wanted to make sure that we could tip her. They brainstormed, and we were charged $.1 for room rental, so that we would have the ability to tip our waitress, and the various other staff who helped make our anniversary wonderful.

I am kinda into healthy eating and so this is a really nice addition. Sometimes you have no idea the salad has way more calories than the sandwich so it is nice to be able to make good choices. I totally couldn&#39;t tell that they were lower in calorie either. We had the lobster flat bread which was super thin and crispy, very good! We also had the caprese salad and they split it for us which was really nice. I had the scallops, which were awesome and my husband had the porkchop. I even had enough to take home!

I love their add on lobster tail to an entree as well.  It is a bit pricey, but, not too bad.  They keep portions smaller (or to a certain calorie count or lower) so it is a healthy choice too!

The restaurant is unique in that they apparently do a new menu every week (hence the 52 in the name). The ingredients are very fresh and they try and use local farm and market products. The menu was spectacular. I couldn&#39;t decide what to get as everything on the menu looked amazing.

I ended up ordering the Asparagus soup and the Carmelized Sea Scallops. The Asparagus soup was only okay, but the scallops were phenomenal. I was expecting only about 4-5 scallops, but the plate had about 8 of them along with the vegetable risotto.

Our server, Samantha, was very knowledgeable and helpful in making reservations. She also had a can do attitude in coming up with some additional options from the Kitchen for some of the vegetarians dining with us.

The CHEF (Antonio) comes out of the kitchen to apologize and recommend a similar lamb dish that they serve for happy hour. Of course I agree... Out comes this very generous portion of the most delicious lamb and Antonio personally serves me a 15 year balsamic that &#34;goes great with it&#34;...Where do you get this kind of attention?

The atmosphere is cozy, yet professional. Casual, yet classy.

The food was delicious and from what I can tell fairly healthy and fresh. I had the rack of lamb which included mashed potatoes and carrots. It was very tasty. The pomegranate sauce gave it a very sweet flavor. 
For an appetizer we had the garlic chicken flatbread and chicken skewers. I highly recommend both of them. 
Their menu does rotate from week to week and month to month so the options I described above may not be available.
All in all a nice place to visit, but pretty standard faire. It&#39;s a safe place to go for special occasions. Otherwise I found it kind of dull. But that&#39;s just my personal opinion. No fault of the restaurant.

I made a reservation for my husband and myself for his Birthday. One of us got stuck at work (I know very sad :( ) and I had to call to push the reservation time further and the lady who picked up the call was very nice and she told us to come whenever we could and she would accommodate us. We ended up an hour late and we got a table with just 5-10 mins of wait time even when the place was packed.

Now coming to the food, We ordered Oak grilled artichokes for appetizer and cedar plank roasted salmon and cedar plank roasted tofu with vegetables for main course. The artichokes and tofu were good, you get what is promised and tastes really good. But omg!! The Salmon!! It was the best we ever had. The spices and the butter and smokiness of it, just everything about it was right, it was melt-in-mouth. I would definitely go back here just for the salmon. And mind you, this coming from someone who is not a fan of seafood is HUGE!!

Our server, Anissa, was a very nice lady. I told her that we are here for my husbands birthday which I had put down on the reservation too so she already knew. So she made a nice toast of champagne and helped  us choose from the many cute little cups of sinful sweet deliciousness. I dont remember the exact names, but I got the mocha and my husbamd got Belgian, both were to the point.

Beautiful ambiance
Amazing service (Lel...he&#39;s amazing...beyond amazing)
Creative menu items for the health conscience

Cons...and it&#39;s significant...
My babe&#39;s steak...cooked wrong 4 times over...no joke.  Ordered medium rare...first steak was well done...second was medium well...third was still mooing...and 4th was a 30 second attempt of recooking steak #3 which just sealed the deal as a epic failure.  My scallops were delicious. But for a man who so wanted a steak that night...he ended getting salmon a good half hour after I was done eating.  Not cool. 

Unfortunately I wanted to love this place for the amazing menu. I just wish the kitchen could cook the items on there.

I kept it light - ordered the goat cheese flatbread. Was very good. It&#39;s meant to be a shareable, so I wasn&#39;t too stuffed. We each had a dessert. They bring you a dessert tray so you can see what your opinions are and choose right then and there.

I didn&#39;t have a cocktail that was on special, but the Perfect Storm was really nice. They had a seasonal Pumpkin pisco sour - which I thought sounded really interesting...but didn&#39;t taste so great. Gotta go more sweet with pumpkin in my opinion. 

They have mini shot glass desserts which are always great. The perfect amount really. I ALWAYS get the cannoli, but I tried the amores this last time and I actually really enjoyed it. 

Now that I know abou the happy hour I&#39;ll be back more often!

**Also, not sure of the hours but they have a piano player IN their little bar area and that is totally a perk in my opinion"

This, to me, is a great setting for a business dinner. It is close to the office buildings in Schaumburg. It is somewhat on the loud side, and seems to be always crowded, so I tend more toward business than romantic. Of course &#34;always crowded&#34; tells you something - it is popular.

Another interesting tweak is that they have mini-desserts. All of them are small and you can get one or several. 

I focused on what is unusual. The fare tends to be American, healthy, a little on the fancier side, and I&#39;ve never had a bad dish in a half-dozen times here."

The food and service was always great, which is why I stopped in there with a friend last Saturday night for a drink and appetizers at the bar. The bar was not busy, it was over an hour before closing time and there were two bartenders available.  My friend and I sat there in disbelief as the two bartenders cleaned glasses, refreshed ice, chatted with one another and other employees.  At one point I put my hand up to signal &#34;hey, we would like a drink!&#34;  Both bartenders looked straight at us and then turned their backs to us.  My friend timed our wait and when we hit the 15 minute mark, we walked out.  As we walked out we stopped at the hostess desk to tell her exactly what happened.  She was speechless - literally.  There was no attempt to fix the situation, no apology, nothing.  I sent an e-mail the next day  via the Seasons 52 website recapping the experience and so far, have heard nothing.  

After my friend and I left Seasons 52 we went over to Tokio Pub.  The service was outstanding and the drinks were excellent."

Tonight was girls night so there was lots of wine and gossiping involved. Our waiter was very patient giving us our time to decide on our meals and he wasn&#39;t pushy when we had been sitting there for a while. 

I&#39;ve been here on a date before and it can be quite a romantic restaurant as well. It&#39;s decorated nicely and dimly lit. I really like the atmosphere here!
 
I made our reservation on Open Table and the restaurant called to confirm w me so I appreciated that.

We chose this place because we are trying to eat healthy and everything is under 500 calories. I got the Ahi Tuna Tartare and a side of risotto. Have never tried either one of these foods before and I thought it was cooked beautifully.

We all tried a dessert which they bring to you on this beautiful platter that makes it impossible to say no to and they are served in what looks like double shot glasses. Gotta love it.

We had an early dinner reservation so it wasn&#39;t that busy yet but they do get busy so call ahead. They have complimentary valet too but I&#39;ve always been able to find a spot."

I have been here a couple times in the last few weeks... and it should have been sooner.  Once was for lunch and just recently for a Thur night dinner. 

Very tasty food and nice ambiance.  It&#39;s casually elegant and very relaxing... could be considered romantic as well.  

Perhaps it&#39;s the live jazzy piano from the bar that seems to provide a better soundtrack. There is a definite lack of flatware clatter and conversational noise... but you don&#39;t notice that... you just feel like you&#39;re in your own social bubble.

We called on a Saturday morning and were told they had no open reservations for 4 that evening, later in the day we called back and they had one open up! We showed up a few minutes early and were promptly seated. 

Our server was very personable and explained the concept, everything on the menu is low calorie, cool, got it. 

We started with some beverages and a steak and blue cheese flatbread. The flatbread was excellent! I normally don&#39;t like blue cheese but this one blended very well with the rest of the dish. 7.5/10

We started with salads and soup;

Chili - it was alright, not much going on, regretted not getting something else 3/10
Warm spinach salad - DELICIOUS! Bacon is great, lots of flavor out of this bad boy 8/10
Field greens salad - standard issue salad, middle of the road 5/10

Then came the dinner; 

Turkey Skewer - This dish was all sorts of mediocre, not much to call home about, would NOT order again 3/10
Copper River Salmon - AMAZING! This dish was sent straight to us from the god of fish, the salmon had a flavor that none of us could get over, it was the most salmon tasting salmon I have ever had, such a rich full flavor, cooked perfectly, amazing 10/10

We of course had to get dessert because why not! 

We had the key lime pie cup (7.5/10), smores cup (8/10), cheesecake cup (2/10), salted caramel something cup (6/10)

A pretty solid dinner effort but the reason I say this place is gimmicky is that when you do the full multi course meal spread it ends up being somewhere around 1500-2500 calories per person, it&#39;s sort of like when an HVAC company sends you a flyer for $29.99 summer tune up but that just gets them in the door, by the time you are all said and done they have overhauled your system for $500+. So in that way it&#39;s very similar to most restaurants, you build your own healthy. If you want low calorie don&#39;t get the steak fried steak, get the grilled chicken salad with dressing on the side, no croutons or cheese."

At first, the ambience was amazing.  The hostess was kind of rude, but we all have our days. We sat at the bar, and our bartender Sonya, was nothing but fantastic. We are vegetarians so we picked two appetizers and a flat bread to enjoy with our cocktails. At first, the bartender brought out hummus and sad the others will be out shortly. Ok we thought, not too big of a deal. About 10 minutes later the rest came out. It was a flatbread, and grilled artichokes. I was trying to eat them, and she was making fun of me, because I wasn&#39;t doing it right. I just kept saying it tastes gritty, and I don&#39;t want another one. She started eating hers and said the same thinking the stem was gritty. Well, after making a horrific face and spitting stuff out of her napkin, we realized what it was. The artichokes had not been cleaned and were covered in mud. We literally took a knife to it and it was almost a clay texture. We both had eaten mud. A few minutes later the bartender asked if we liked everything. I told her I think we are going to make clay pots, because these have mud all over them. She offered to get us another one, but we just wanted the whole thing off out table. She also offered another dish, but we were so turned off by it we didn&#39;t want any. We finished our pizza since we were so hungry, but just couldn&#39;t enjoy it after that. We both work in the industry and understand things happen. However, when they do, it&#39;s nice to go the extra mile and make it right(we do). They took it off out bill... No duh... But no manager came to apologize, not even a dessert offered. I wouldn&#39;t have eaten eat because we&#39;re were so disgusted, but the gesture. I am completely turned off this place, and she now is too on her fifteenth time back."

I had a nice pork tenderloin and my wife had chicken. Very tasty and proper portion sizes. Desserts are the usual small portion so you can get two - more than enough.
Issue 1 - the beer selection is uninspiring and the lack draft. They go seasonal with the food, do the same with the beer. And stop falling into the beer = ale (IPA, PA, A) and get some other darker varieties on there.
Issue 2 - valet parking in the suburbs should be banned. There are ample parking spots and I don&#39;t feel the need to tip someone to park my car in the lot. If they would unblock the last row, the need goes away. Very annoying."

The food, the menu and the ambiance were just perfect, but our service was definitely lacking. 

We went on a Sunday afternoon at 2pm. They weren&#39;t overly busy, I mean, it was an awkward time to be there since it was kind of late for lunch and too early for dinner. We didn&#39;t want to go when it was super crowded because we had my 2 year-old son with us. Our server did explain the menu in detail, but it took her forever to take our order, pick up our plates, and bring dessert menus.... That was the only drawback. 

I opted for the restaurant menu meal which was 3 courses for $20. I had the mushroom bisque soup which was super light and flavorful, and I had the flat iron steak salad. It was unbelievable. One of the best salads I&#39;ve ever had. I was there with my family (6 of us) and everything everyone ordered was perfect and fresh! We also tried the rainbow trout, the mushroom and arugula salad, the organic field green salad, the filet and the lobster papadelle pasta. No complaints from anyone! We were all satisfied.

The desserts are super cute and I highly recommend them. I recommend ALL OF THEM! I&#39;ll definitely head back to Season this summer to try their summer menu. Definitely loved it and worth it!"

I made a reservation for dinner via open table from their yelp page which makes it very convenient.  When we were seated our waiter, Tom, asked which one of us was Melissa and then went on to thank me for making a reservation.  He even addressed me by name throughout the meal and made it much more personal.  What a nice touch!  Tom was very knowledgeable and explained their menu (according to him, they&#39;re known for their flatbreads).  

I chose to start off with a glass of wine and asked if he had any suggestions on a nice red.  He let me taste a light, fruity one and I didn&#39;t particularly like it so he went to find a more oak-y red which turned out to be a 2010 cabernet (whose name I can&#39;t remember...sorry guys).  

My friend and I decided to try a flatbread as an appetizer since they are known for it and settled on the lobster and fresh mozzarella flatbread.  It came out pretty quickly which surprised me since they were pretty busy when we came at 5:30pm (Yeah yeah we&#39;re grandmas eating that early on a Saturday, don&#39;t judge!).  The flatbread was paper thin and crispy but wasn&#39;t outstanding by any means.  There was a decent amount on lobster and mozzarella but the green onions that topped the flatbread completely overpowered the appetizer.  I highly suggest either removing the green onions or taking some off.

As for our entrees, I ordered the pork tenderloin and portobello and my friend had the cedar planked salmon.  Both of our dishes were ok but they weren&#39;t amazing and I expected better for the price (Hers was $20 and mine was around $18).  I ordered my pork to be cooked medium and it came out fairly tender which I was happy with.  It was plated on a base of creamy polenta with a side of broccolini...too bad it wasn&#39;t creamy and there were only 2 stalks of broccolini.  The polenta was rather clumpy and gelatinous instead of being thicker and creamy.  I tried a bite of my friend&#39;s salmon and that was much better than mine.  It was tender and had a nice sweet glaze on it if I remember correctly.  

If I hadn&#39;t had a giftcard to Seasons 52 I don&#39;t think I would have came.  I am glad I tried it but most likely wouldn&#39;t return.  Although service was spot on, the food wasn&#39;t anywhere good enough to bring me back especially with it being overpriced."

It was our first time at Seasons 52 and we are definitely planning to be back. 
We mentioned to our server Samantha that we are gong to a comedy show at Improv and she took notice. 
Our food and drinks were in front of us very fast. The exception was the side of Brussels Sprouts that we ordered additionally. We were almost done with the main dish when Sam brought a side of asparagus, apologized and explaining that there was a mix up. 
Shortly after, a nice cook came out of the kitchen, again with apologies and explanation. She said she knows we have a show to catch and the Brussels are almost done and would we like them to go? Sure, we said. She added that dessert is on them tonight. The way they present dessert is super quick and convenient, and we were all done in no time. The total on the check was very reasonable.

I had the Chilean Sea bass that that was served on a bed of black rice which was recommended by Artur and it was delicious. I was able to cut through it like butter with my fork, tender is an understatement.

The first sign that there would be problems was when we entered and saw a sea of people waiting for table and it was only 5:10pm.  But we waited our turn and were seated by 5:20, not bad for a 5:15 reservation.

The hostess brought us to your back patio.  Trouble sign #2 was trying to navigate through the restaurant.  Servers were going very which way, and guests looked perturbed by the steady stream of people walking by.  When we got to the patio, we saw a flank of small tables for two.  As we were directed to our table, we were truly befuddled.  The table were so crammed in that there was no way we could even sit at the table without telling already seated diners to move.  Unfortunately, they had nowhere to move to as they were similarly crammed in.  We told the hostess, and she promised us another table.  As we surveyed the room, we saw that we definitely did not want to sit in this overly cramped room.  Usually, this room is highly desirable, but tonight it was set up like a cattle car.

At that time, we invoked the manager&#39;s name (who had given us gift certificates after a bad experience we had last year), and the hostess arranged to get us a table in the main dining room.  Unfortunately, by then we were already embarrassed and didn&#39;t want to make a scene.  Also, we still had PTSD from our last visit, and there was no way we could even sit and enjoy a meal.  So we decided to leave.  

We are very sad because Seasons 52 was always a special place for us.  Now we cringe when we think about it.  We will miss the restaurant.  We still have your gift certificates, and who knows, maybe we will try again some day (and not around a holiday), but that may be a very long time from now.

Seasons 52 management: please remember what makes Seasons 52 special and why people like to go there, and make that a reality every night.  Don&#39;t give in to the corporate management that demanded that you increase your revenues on the holiday by cramming in more tables than you could accommodate.  Trust me, we are not the only patrons you disappointed tonight.  We had similarly bad experiences on other Valentines Day dinners in previous years and have NEVER gone back to those restaurants.  Those restaurants are now shuttered, and I have to believe they closed because they compromised on their values and went for the $$.  I hope Seasons 52 does not fall victim to the same fate."

Our waitress was very friendly and gave us a lot of information about the items on the menu. Really the only negative of the night for my husband and I was that we had to wait on the waitress on a few occasions, nothing terrible, but not overly attentive either. I started my meal with the potato leek soup- delicious, and moved on to the short rib for my entree. It was a little on the higher calorie side- but I enjoyed the variety and the knowledge that the menu brought. My husband had the shrimp and grits- we were both very pleased with our entrees and would definitely eat them again.

They were open for dinner, but it wasn&#39;t busy, and he was helping others.  They also told us about the $5 appetizers for happy hour but then we had to flag him down to take our order.  The bill was hard to find (yes, they put it there for you, but it&#39;s not easy to see and I usually see this type of billing at a bar at less &#39;fancy&#39; spots).  

I still think their food is quite good and deceivingly delicious considering the calorie counts, but this particular location had lackluster service."

Was not disappointed.  In fact saw other coworkers at the place during lunch, so must be good.  

Ordered the ginseng chicken porridge, recommended by a coworker.  It&#39;s a comfort food, especially on a cold winter day or if not feeling well.   Couldn&#39;t taste ginseng but the porridge creamy with shredded chicken that&#39;s just perfect. Not dry at all.   

Seafood pancake --  came out on a cast iron, gigantic, krispy and so yummy !  they didn&#39;t skimp on the seafood.  Every bite I got a bit of octopus and scallion

Will definitely go back to try more items"

I have been to this location at least 3 times, once downtown, and once in Oak Brook.  It doesn&#39;t matter where you go - they are all consistent across the board, which is nice.  Not excellent food, but really good.  I like that the calories are reasonable and the desserts small (so you can get more than one).  I got the sesame salmon salad with pineapple, mango, and jicama salad.  Any of the salads - steak or tuna - are solid.  The flatbreads are a good option too for an app.  My coworker got the steak and Bleu cheese one for her entree.  We also got the roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon and Parmesan to share.  They were crispy and seasoned well.  No desserts this time, but the pumpkin pie and pecan pie are my favorites.  Also good for work meetings - they let you sit without making you feel rushed."

I came with my parents specifically for the happy hour and wow, what a treat. Each happy hour menu item is only 5 dollars and we decided to try each one except the almonds. We ordered daily special, a whole branzino fish, two drinks and dessert.

Out of the happy hour menu items, I&#39;d say the chicken and scallops were the best. The chicken was smoky, tender, and filling. The scallops were seasoned perfectly and succulent. The other items were fine. They ran out of the shrimp so we didn&#39;t get to try that dish, however, they offered to give us another shrimp appetizer on the house! We replaced it with the cocktail shrimp and it was great. The shrimp was fresh and deveined. The branzino was great and packed a ton of meat (never tried this fish before). I would skip the lemonades they have here because it is almost tasteless. However, it is free refills, so your call! I love the mini, cheap, high-quality dessert concept here. Usually I can never finish a full dessert just because it&#39;s too sweet but the portion here is just perfect enough for me and it&#39;s tasty. I got the apple pie and the pecan pie.

Free valet parking, place is super classy, prices are reasonable. I LOVE IT! Make sure to have a reservation though. I&#39;ve been trying to come other times before but they are just packed full."

On a Friday too?
$5 buys me lamb chops and half-dollar sized sea scallops???

Yes. Yes and YES!

For those plates, I got 2 chops and 3 scallops. My friend told me to not order too much because the wine flight comes with a full sized flatbread. The best part, the flight means getting a full pour of the favorite. I like how there is a paper ring around the glass with the name of the wine and descriptors like crisp, tannic, pear and keep so you can find a bottle for home. The food was really good, scallops are tender and the lamb chops have a slight sweet savoriness. The flatbread is so thin and crispy even after it has been sitting for a few hours while we slowly grazed and sipped our wines.

I&#39;ve been to the Seasons 52 in downtown Chicago and I generally like their selections. Service is great, I think over the course of the evening, we had 3 bartenders take care of us. Timing is key and I&#39;ll be back for more happy hours."

Every time I eat them, I get sick. I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos here, without realizing that they have avocado in them until after my first bite. Our server, Christov, took them back, checked with me on the type of allergy that I have to see if I would be ok (I will) replaced the tacos without avocado and comped desserts for us. I have had recent similar experiences that were handled terribly by the staff and establishment. Seasons 52 went above and beyond, even though the fault was not theirs. Christov and Seasons exceeded my expectations for customer service in this type of situation. Truly professional. Thanks! 

Oh, and the food was de-lish too :)"

I&#39;ve been here multiple times and each time has been wonderful.  The service is always prompt and courteous.  The food is always spectacular and the atmosphere is rather romantic.

All of the food choices sound delicious, but I usually go with the BBQ turkey skewer.  It has a fantastic BBQ sauce that is not over powerful and lets you really taste the turkey.  This meal is served over a rice/vegetables which goes well together.  If I recall correctly all meals are less than 500 calories.

The desserts are amazing as well.  The chocolate peanut butter one is my favorite and is a nice finish to the meal.

They usually have a live pianist in the bar area which is pretty neat to watch.  If that isn&#39;t what you&#39;re looking for the main seating area is for you.  The main area has a.pretty open concept and you can see most of the kitchen.


The ambiance of the inside is a quiet, cool, romantic vibe that makes for a great experience."

Specifically, Andrew provided an excellent experience for us and made insightful recommendations for cocktails and entrees. A perfect balance of service and style; checked in on us without being obtrusive and a great personality.

We used to go to Shaw&#39;s in the same plaza but after being at Seasons 52 just once, I can tell that the quality in food is vastly difference and it can be much friendlier on your wallet too if you follow my tips. Now, just because I said it&#39;s a great place for date night, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t go here with girlfriends, or celebrate a birthday with friends or have family dinners. Please do all that as I plan to come back here for the many wonderful occasions aforementioned. 

Food-wise please see my photos upload for this place. There&#39;s also tons of other food pics in the gallery for this restaurant as well. However, it is hard to keep up because this place is called Season 52 for a very special reason: it is for the 52 weeks in the year and the 52 weekly menu that changes! How cool is that?! 

There is one constant menu that changes only seasonally (I think every 3 months) and that is going to be the big chunk in the front and center of the menu. But if you look over to the right hand side, there is a narrow column that will tell you the specials for the week, and that will change every week! For the rotating weekly menu, they will offer a few choices for soup, appetizer, salad and entrees. This is what Season 52 is all about, and it is genius marketing because if the food is good, people will come back to try out the other menu.  It&#39;s a win win because for foodies like us, you&#39;ll never feel bored going back to the same place several times!

Now, here are my tips if you want to dine here but want to get the most bang for your buck or if you&#39;re tight on your budget. Instead of going straight to the entrees (which are in the mid 20&#39;s to even 30s, it gets pricey), go for the appetizers. They have a HUGE selection of appetizers, and they&#39;re all really delicious. The ingredients tastes fresh, the flavor is aromatic and not heavily reliant on salt or oil to mask its taste. Plus, every dish is under 500 calories. 

So for the price of one entree (portion is generally small), I actually got 2 decent sized appetizers in place. These apps are priced $9-13.  We actually ordered one entree and 4 appetizers and 2 desserts, in the end our bill came out to be under $65 for two. We were so full at the end and even had 2 doggie bags to take home. When we used to go to other restaurants of the same scale, I couldn&#39;t say we were this well fed for the amount that we spent. We have spent much more and had less food!

So here&#39;s the breakdown of what we ordered:

Appetizers: 
Grilled Garlic Pesto Chicken Flatbread- the BEST flatbread I&#39;ve ever tasted. 
Grilled Shrimp Flatbread- I don&#39;t see this on the menu anymore but it was good!
Ahi Tuna Tartare- very fresh ahi tuna
Thai Lemon Grass Mussels- such unique flavor, super flavorful, the best!

Entree:
Shrimp Cavatappi Pasta- small portion but well cooked, not salty, taste just right.

Desserts
Mocha Macchiato- my favorite of the desserts, must try if you like coffee flavor!
Mango Cheesecake- yummy and mild in flavor, for those who like their desert rich.

Aside from the food, the service was really great. Our water got refilled, the apps came out quick. Our entree did take a little more time but the sous-chef came out to bring us the dish to us and comped one of our flatbread due to the wait. I ended up tipping 30% that night because I was so satisfied with the service. When customers are satisfied, that speaks volume for a business!"

We didn&#39;t make reservations which was my mistake, however we were able to sit at the bar immediately and have a few drinks to start. When there was a booth available the hostess came right to us and brought us to our booth. Mark was our server, he made the experience what it was. He gave us &#34;what the chef recommends&#34; on a few items including the lamb chops that i got.. He said to get them medium rare for best flavor, could not have been more spot on! My wife got the NY strip and was very pleased. We had a mushroom flat bread to start, very tasty.  
As a nice gesture he brought us 2 small glasses of champagne to help us celebrate our wedding anniversary, GREAT TOUCH!! That really left a great impression on my wife and I. Having 2 little children at home we don&#39;t get many nights out (this was our first since the baby was born) so to have such a great experience on our wedding anniversary was awesome!"

The food is always excellent, the staff is very welcoming, and it is worth every penny.  The only downfall is that whenever we have made reservations (highly recommended if not mandatory) we still end up waiting anywhere from half an hour to an hour to be seated.  Make sure to make reservations, weekdays are better with seating than weekends for sure! Delicious!"

Seasons 52 is one of my family&#39;s favorite places to celebrate! Everyone from my grandparents to aunt and younger brother all enjoy dining here. We had been to the Seasons 52 in Orlando and were so happy when they began opening in the Chicago burbs. 

This time we dined at the one in Schaumberg Sunday afternoon for my grandmothers birthday. We had a group of 12 people and we had a great time. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that although the service was friendly, it was somewhat lacking. Our water glasses were never refilled and I would have loved to get an additional glass of wine during my meal but didn&#39;t flag anyone down. For the price you pay I think consistent, but not over the top service is important.

To start with, we ordered a few different flat breads to share. The steak and blue cheeses and margarita were both very good and were crowd pleasers. I also had the corn chowder which was delicious, especially with the bacon.:)

For a main course I usually get the salmon salad or sea bass which are both very good but this time I decided to try the Sea Scallops. I am so glad I changed things up! They were perfectly cooked and the risotto that came with was creamy and so good!

My husband got the southern style shrimp and grits which was awesome!  Did I mention that most of these entrees are around 500 calories (except the shrimp and grits of course :))!? For a restaurant that is great!!! 

For dessert they offer small shot glass sized desserts. The waiter brings the options right to the table for you see and choose from. I usually get the pecan pie or key lime pie which are both delicious! So many to choose from but it&#39;s nice everyone can choose what they want. A great way to end the meal with something small and sweet."

They also have a separate hot tea menu which we appreciated.  I REALLY appreciate how they have the calories on the menu.  They come around after and tempt you with delicious looking dessert, which my mom did end up getting.

I wanted to thank you for the best December Holiday Party 2013.  My co-workers and I enjoyed your food, customer service, and just the perfect classy atmosphere.  Your restaurant is so clean that you could possibly eat on the floor.  I know I&#39;m over embellishing.  But overall, I would come back for another meal.

Your servers were more than attentive and were always to the point from the smile on their faces, their willingness to go above and beyond, to refilling our drinks, and to the service of the food.  We were never neglected, not even once.  What ever we asked for, your Servers were willing to do, of course within reason.  I have to say this was the best customer service I have experienced in a long time.   

Your food was also awesome.  We had ordered:
Appetizers:
Grilled Garlic Pesto Chicken fresh mozzarella cheese, balsamic onions, roasted red peppers, arugula
Blackened Steak &amp; Blue Cheese cremini mushrooms, spinach, caramelized onions
Lump Crab, Roasted Shrimp &amp; Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms under parmesan-panko crust
Shrimp Cocktail
All the appetizers were so good that I had no complaints on any.  Of course my favorite out of all was the Shrimp Cocktail but that&#39;s my love for the seafood.  The Flatbreads were also great.  It had the right balance, and nothing was overwhelming with any ingredient.  Also the crab cake was cooked perfectly.  The combination of the crunch and soft middle was just exquisite. 

Small Salad:
Organic Field Greens cucumbers, tomatoes, pumpkin seeds, white balsamic vinaigrette
I&#39;m sure anyone can make a salad but I will still give you the praise you deserve with making this good for us.  The salad dressing vinaigrette wasn&#39;t too salty or oily.  I truly enjoyed this.

Fish and Seafood:
*Cedar-Plank Roasted Salmon &amp; Vegetables red bliss potatoes, dill-mustard sauce, grilled lemon
This tasted so good!  The fish was cooked perfectly and not overcooked like some restaurants would.  The marriage between the salmon and dill-mustard sauce was awesome.  I would recommend this to all my friends and family who love fish.

Dessert:
Mini Indulgences... individual servings of classic desserts
Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse
Key Lime Pie
Mocha Macchiato
Pecan Pie with Vanilla Mousse
Tropical Fruit Cheesecake
Belgian Chocolate Rocky Road
Raspberry Chocolate Chip Cannoli
Market Fresh Fruit
OMG!  Words can&#39;t describe the beautiful taste that swirled around when I tasted what I could.  I was really full but the careful creation of these were just too hard to pass up.  So, I tasted as many as I could and loved every bite.  I thought these were going to be too sweet but not at all.  The sweet wasn&#39;t overpowering and it&#39;s just the perfect end to a perfect meal.

Anyway, thank you for the experience and for letting us spend our 2013 Holiday Party with you and your employees.  I hope our owners decide to have it there for 2014.

My wife and I have been to Seasons 52 numerous times and have always been very satisfied. Their menu features seasonal items under 450 calories. Veggies are always fresh and meats and fish are always yummy. 

Our favorite feature is their double shot glass-sized desserts! At the end of the meal, the waiter brings by a tray of mini desserts. They&#39;re always decadent, but not too filling."

However, don&#39;t come here expecting the food to sweep you off your feet.I went here on a Tuesday night and the service was fine (not great), but we managed to have a good time nonetheless.

The drinks were fun and there was a good variety. We had the the steak &amp; blue cheese flatbread and duck wing lollipops for appetizers. The flatbread was average at best--too bland for my taste-- while the lollipops were simply fantastic. The sauce was spicy enough to give your mouth a good tingle but not enough to have you gasping for water, I highly recommend having this fantastic appetizer. For dinner we ordered the turkey skewer and pork tenderloin. Frankly, nether of these are worth writing home about. They were both cooked well but the flavor just wasn&#39;t there.

Overall, I had a okay experience and would not protest coming back here. However, I would have trouble suggesting to my friends that we should go out to eat here over better alternatives."

Locally grown meats and produce, great service, wonderful atmosphere, the perfect place to eat after a long morning business meeting. Now, I will say, their menu changes each week (hence the 52 in the restaurant name, LOVE IT!) so I will comment on what I experienced but you may not be lucky enough to have the same! 

All 4 of us started with the butternut squash soup which was outstanding. First time I had butternut squash soup that was not overly sweetened or flavored. It was fresh and delicious. Served with crispy crimini mushrooms and a small breadstick. Everyone loved it.

The table (besides me) shared a lump crab flatbread as an appetizer and scarfed it up.

I had the Vegetarian Tasting quinoa-citrus salad, soft taco, vegetables, cedar-roasted tofu, tropical salsa that came served with broccolini. The flavors of every component of this dish was SPOT ON! Again, not overly seasoned, very well presented and beautiful. The fruit salsa on the tofu was so good, couldn&#39;t get enough. Broccolini was cooked to perfection. The quinoa was served with mandarin orange slices and mint, which I would have never put together but it was fantastic. And ohmygosh the taco was perfect! I practically licked the plate clean :)

The others had lump crab cakes, the iceberg salad and an heirloom tomato salad. I could not locate online the exact menu items as they are changed so often but everyone seemed very happy with their meal. 

The desserts (non vegan) are well presented and the perfect serving size! It&#39;s hard to say no to a &#34;mini indulgence dessert&#34; after a great meal. 

I WISH there was a Seasons 52 closer to Chicago and I would frequent there, but until next time. Go here, you will not regret it!"

It has been made even better by the amazing staff, in particular a server named Marcos. He is attentive, gives great recommendations and is very personable and makes you feel like you--request to be seated in his section..it will surely make for a memorable evening!! The food is amazing.. flatbreads are scrumptious and the drinks..OMG!! the best thing I have ever had is the Hawaiian Cosmo-perfectly balanced, not too sweet, not too tart. But be careful--they are strong!! The scallops are my all time favorite. Perfectly cooked and sweet, sitting atop butternut squash risotto with a side of broccoli. Perfectly balanced and mouthwatering. And the mini deserts.. what a concept! Satisfies without leaving you feeling overstuffed! The raspberry cannoli is my fav! The other thing I love about this place is that they have a piano player every day from 5 to 8 or 9. They sit in the middle of the bar (literally) and there are comfy tables all around the perimeter of the bar area that you can dine at. It is cozy and comfortable and that is our favorite place to sit. They also offer a happy hour menu Monday through Friday from 4-6:30 that offer drink specials and smaller plates so you can sample several different menu items. This place is one of our &#34;regulars&#34; that we enjoy coming to when we have our &#34;date nights&#34;.. Be sure to make reservations as this place gets packed after 4:30 and getting a table is near impossible. Also, the bar area tables are first come, first serve, so come early if you plan to sit in this area!"

Came here off the reviews (thanks Yelp!). Boy I tell you, all the other 5 star review don&#39;t lie. This is THE SPOT.

I like the &#34;traditional&#34; ambiance in here and the place is really clean. The owner was really friendly. They give you some complementary chips and homemade salsa if you dine in; salsa is really good.

I got the chicken Quesadilla dinner. It was amazing. The chicken was seasoned well and the huge tortilla was filling. My wife got the enchilada dinner which was also really good. I can for certain say I&#39;ll be back here."

The luncheon was nice. Salad was good. The grilled calamari appetizer was good. Everybody ordered off the menu individually so I can only comment on my entrée. I ordered this spicy Shrimp diavolo over linguini. Guess what? This dish was actually spicy. A lot of places list things as spicy and they&#39;re really not but this one was. It was also loaded with fresh tasting shrimp. I enjoyed this dish.
I may just have to return to check out other menus items.
Service was pretty good considering that there was only one server with a helper for over twenty people.

Cheers to all"

First we walk in the hostess says we can&#39;t sit outside because not everyone in our party was 21 which would be understandable of about a month prior my family came with the same number of people same ages and they sat outside no problem. Waitress came and said its ok there is adults so we headed outside then the hostess came with an attitude and said I choose where you sit. Then they messed up my nephews order which wasn&#39;t a big deal but then they bring some desert and said here this is for you guys because we messed up with the pasta. We get the bill and what happens they charged us for what they sent out that was suppose to be on the house. Very disappointing."

There was a ton of back and forth (which I wanted to stop as they were closing) but it was hard to get an explanation of what happened. We eventually found out that the prices have since changed by a few dollars and the menu was outdated. That&#39;s all fine, but more than one person had confusion and it could have been explained when we ordered. My group insisted that we all leave a good tip for service but the whole experience made me want to stay away for dine in or take out.

We ordered the Combination which had sausage, mushrooms and peppers.  The establishment was clean and the server was nice.  My daughter wanted the buffet but since Aurillio&#39;s considers her an adult (just turned 10 years old), it would have been $10 for her.  Seriously, I think that is too young to pay full price.

As my guest and I were waiting to be served, we overheard an employee (which turned out to be the owner) make a comment regarding &#34;the two non tippers&#34;.  As he nodded over our direction.  We knew he was referring to us.  We went on with our lunch and brought it up to the staffs attention after we paid.  A simple report of a complaint turned into a debate/argument with the owner and his wife Sharon.

Apparently tips are mandatory at this restaurant, otherwise prepare to have employees making side comments and not giving you preference while you are there.  At least, that&#39;s what the owners made clear to us. Is that there workers deserve and earn their tips every single day.  I was obviously unaware of the mandatory tip rule.  But this would explain the extremely rude behavior of their staff.  

It&#39;s clear that in the server and serving world, tips are earned.  If employees aren&#39;t offering at the least satisfactory service, a tip should not be warranted.  And in my experience there several times, I may have received above and beyond service one of those times.  In which a tip was warranted to the server.  

I will not be dining their again ever again.  Food was excellent.  The service was absolutely wretched."

In the last ten years or so, the demand for authentic Italian pizza from a wood burning oven has brought a lot of competition, and then there is Aurelio&#39;s Pizza, which is somewhere in between. Instead of catering to one or the other, Aurelio&#39;s makes a pizza that looks more like other pizzas in the Midwest. The difference, though, is that the pizza here tastes much much better. You can taste it in the ingredients. 

Aurelio&#39;s is definitely a place for families and groups. One Sunday we went out with a group of 12, and four pizzas later, everyone was full and happy with the quality of the meal. We reported a bill of $110 (including tip). The location is clean, and the service is friendly. 

They do have a bar with the basics on tap, and a few liquors if you want something stronger. You can also order a red or white wine. For the price I would just stick to water or pitchers of soda. 

The desserts are ok, and they are huge! So if you enjoy desserts, try some here. Enjoy!"

My family and I dined in the restaurant last week and really enjoyed the pizza.  Our server was very nice and gave us a menu and told us they would deliver tand that her Mother lived in our neighborhood.  The pizza was so good that I&#39;ve been thinking about it for 5 days.  I decided to order pizza for dinner today.  When we called to place our order and we told them which town we were in they asked if we were before or after Gary Ave.   We told them we were before Gary off of Schmale.  Then they told us that they don&#39;t go as far as Schmale.  Coming from the restaurant, you would pass Schmale on your way to Gary.  I think they should be asking if we lived before or after Schmale or even Bloomingdale Road if they don&#39;t go pass Schmale.  Now I&#39;m just really disappointed and have nothing planned for dinner."

I get confused down there, so I&#39;m not sure if it was K3/Bourbonais or Manteno. They all kind of blend into an I-57 haze for me. 

Anyway, I got excited when I found out that the Aurelio&#39;s in Addison, just a few minutes away from my job also has the affordable lunch buffet option. 

But they don&#39;t do it as well as the K3 store. 

They only offered 6 pizzas for selection, and two of them were duplicates. So essentially they had 4 options. And their hot entree options were limited as well. 

Fortunately, the pizza is still delicious and the service was stellar so I&#39;m only going to knock a single star off this review. I feel that if you run a business under a corporate brand umbrella, your offerings from restaurant to restaurant should be equal in terms of quality and offerings.

My server brought me a cute little mini-pitcher of soda so I wouldn&#39;t run out of my beverage during my meal. That was a nice touch that I haven&#39;t seen many other places. 

I may return out of location convenience, but if I had my druthers I would only patronize the Kankakee location."

If the bar was not set so high, my comments wouldn&#39;t be nearly so specific or tough. However I&#39;m a thin crust fan from Flossmoor and to be the best you gotta keep pushing.

The way she spoke to her customers would not be allowed in any place of business whatsoever.  What I did get from the conversation was that she mistakenly seated this group of people in error, thinking it was a party that had a reservation.  Doesn&#39;t sound like that was the customers fault to me but she certainly made them feel like it was THEIR fault with the way she was speaking to them.  The large group said they were going to just leave as it was apparent she didn&#39;t want their business and as they all got up to leave, the owner shouted &#34;you know what?  Get out of here.

My husband arrived home with a large cheese thin-crust that was a little cool in one corner and had that &#34;cheese has just started to get cold&#34; look about it. (This cannot be blamed on Aurelio&#39;s, but rather, Lake St traffic.)

And yet it was one of the more delicious thin crusts I have had in recent memory. The crust was crispy around the edges and had a great flavor; the sauce, while just a hair on the sweet side, had plenty of savory to it; and the cheese was delicious, plentiful, and actually broke when you bit into it. (It is a minor pet peeve of mine when you take a bite of pizza and all of the cheese comes with it.)

The rest of their menu is large and varied, and I&#39;d like to dine in or at least try an appetizer or two, but honestly, it will be hard to resist the pizza, which is currently up there with Home Run Inn as my favorite thin crust in the area.

=====================

11/1/10:
We&#39;ve now eaten in and tried a few different things. The atmosphere is sort of odd, a mash-up of Chicago history, random old ads, and red-and-white checked stuff.

We started with their focaccia appetizer, which was different and delightful -- crispy bread stuffed with cheese and basil and served with a sweet, thick sauce for dipping. We moved on to a stuffed cheese pizza, which probably wouldn&#39;t be my first choice again, if only because there wasn&#39;t much sauce on it and the top crust got lost and turned into kind of a mess. It was good overall, and I definitely appreciated the &#34;handle&#34; part of the crust, which had a nice light crispiness to it and wasn&#39;t overly bready or thick. But I wonder if their version of deep dish has more/chunkier sauce.

I&#39;d certainly be willing to eat it again, and try more of their menu, but as far as I&#39;m concerned their thin crust is where it&#39;s at."

It wasn&#39;t BAD, it just didn&#39;t blow my mind.  The pepperoni and sausage were both really good.  The cheese was really fresh too.  I just think that the execution of all the ingredients together is what didn&#39;t do it for me.  The crust was decent...it could have used a little more flavor or crisp to make it awesome, the sauce was really sweet, and the cheese was kind of plain, so when you throw it all together, it was just okay.  We also got the pizza bread and the bruschetta, and neither were that great.  The &#34;bruschetta&#34; had good bread and oil, but the tomato, celery (what the hell is celery doing on bruschetta?!?), and melted mozz topping was just no good.  Meh."

There is plenty of parking near their entrance and they have a terrace for outdoor seating.  The front entrance is a little small but there is never a wait.

I&#39;ve been there a few times for lunch buffet and dinner.  The lunch buffet is a great deal since you don&#39;t have to wait and you can get in and out of there pretty quickly.  They have a full salad bar with some cold pasta items and then mostly hot pasta specialties.  Each of the pastas are different with varying sauces so vegetarians or meaty or cheese preferences are satisfied.  There&#39;s also a chicken dish and sometimes Italian sausage.  The pizzas are in the back and they have their good thin crust with a deep dish specialty added in.  There are a couple of soups and a whole table full of desserts.  The standard American desserts along with their Italian homemade ones are there for any type of sweet tooth.  The prices are good value.  They have a pretty vast menu so there&#39;s always good reason to go back!"

MAANNN I was disappointed!  I thought about putting them on my &#34;list of bad places&#34;, but alas I decided to order my usual from the joint, again.  Success!!  The first time, the pizza was soggy and very unappetizing however, the second was crispy, done to perfection and AWESOME!!  The tomato bread (my fave), on the first order, had chopped tomatoes and tasted just plain yucky.  Did they forget the garlic???  The second order of tomato bread was great!! sliced tomatoes and great cheesy garlicy taste...YUM.

I would&#39;ve given it 5 stars, but there was no marinera sauce with the tomato bread...booooo.

My fiance and I also like their antipasto salad. They also can make fresh meatballs for their pasta per request. Just be willing to wait a little longer for fresh meatballs.

if I were to rate only their carryout service, they would get a five. Unfortunately, their table service is a little lacking.

When my fiance and I ate in the restaurant, we felt rushed to finish. We weren&#39;t even offered coffee and dessert at the end of our meal. The waitress just gave us our check and high tailed it out of there. We were eating dinner at around 8ish, and they didn&#39;t close until 10. Why the hurry?

They have a large outdoor patio with many tables for the spring and summer time. Their pizza is consistently good, along with the appetizers, specifically their bruschetta. We order pretty simply from here, sausage and cheese pizzas, but they&#39;re always good. The crust is crisp and crunchy, the meats are thick and flavorful.

The cheese is great, you can tell it&#39;s real mozza which is important. They also have a really good pizza buffet for lunch. Most times I am not a fan of any kind of buffet, but this one I absolutely like. Great choice of pizza, soup/salad, pasta dishes and great dessert selection.

Best of all, they have a dinner buffet, I think it is Mon-Thurs, call and check. This is the best idea ever, because a) you can sample all their food; b) they are right next to the Marcus Cinema and people can easily go right to the buffet and leave in time for the movie, don&#39;t have to worry about crowds or timing of food!.

However, I recently took an out-of-town guest here for some deep dish. The crust was so tough, it was difficult to eat. The crust towered high over the sad, flat interior. The toppings were also sparse. My guest actually said, &#34;Giordano&#39;s is better.&#34; Yikes.

Also, the service has taken a dive recently. The staff rarely comes to check on you, which makes it difficult to do things like pay the bill.

The service is pretty good (I mean their speedy with drink refills) and for the most part their very friendly! I should order off their menu at some point but for my hour lunch limitation, their buffet is very convenient and their prices are commensurate to the food quality.

We were over charged for the tip. They added 20% gratuity on top of the tax for terrible service .....for a buffet. It was impossible to get a drink refill. The server was not around 90% of the time.

I think this place is known for having bad service and charging 20% tip automatically for small groups too. 

When my sister called to ask about being over charged, the owner was extremely rude and told her that she and our family were to never come back! This was out of line and totally unwarranted.

Well, you haven&#39;t lived. Ha! Comes with 4 teenie-tiny marshmellow as a garnish. Cute! We had a stuffed artichoke appetizer for the first time. It had a delicious lemon seasoning and, I think, they use Panko breadcrumbs because the stuffing was crispy-good. Had their largest thin crust spinach/sausage pizza because we like to have plenty of leftovers. It&#39;snot just spinach on a pie. It&#39;s a special marinated recipe that&#39;s to die for.

The service was excellent. We went early -- like 5:30 or so.  Our server was very attentive...the bussers cleared our plates in the heartbeat...asked if we&#39;d like refills promptly. I was really pleasantly surprised with the service because it was top notch.

1)  ordered fried ravioli.  Some pieces were hot, some were warm, some were cold.  But all of them tasted like it was a frozen food dropped into the fryer.  I ate it because i was hungry, but honestly, any cold cheese dish made to be eaten hot is just yucky.

2)  got their deep dish pizza.  it was came out looking so yummy.  Took a bite and it was cool.  OMG, W-T-FREAK?  Is the oven broken?  Worried I sent it back hoping no additional ingredients would be added.  Came back, the flavor was good, but now the crust is soggy.  erghhh?  isn&#39;t Chicago the pride of deep dish?  

Word to the business:  don&#39;t hurry your food.  make it worth while.  

Maybe i should have ordered a pasta dish, but  2 out of 2 dishes coming out disappointing, I can&#39;t  say much positive but...

STAFF was really friendly.  Did what they could, but not enough to make up for the lack of food.

Thank goodness it was paid for by my company, or it would have been a waste of my money.  I just sacrificed a few hundred calories.  Took one for the Yelp team."

4-5 different pizzas (including stuffed and some kind of spinach calzone thingy that is absolutely wonderful)

**Note...after eating here on Easter Sunday, I realized that they up their brunch price from about $11.00 to $16.00 just because it was for Easter!  And there was nothing new on the buffet either to make the price go up...it solely went up due to the holiday...I&#39;m really not feeling that...so I have to dock a star!**"

The pizza never disappoints at this location - always too hot to eat when it arrives at the table but you can&#39;t help digging in because it is just so tasty! My family and I have never had the buffet at lunch time (wish they would offer on the weekend or dinner time during the week!).  Most visits we have very good service.  My only pet peeve, and this is with every Aurelio&#39;s location I have been, is that there are not unlimited refills on drinks.  I think the company is stuck back in the 20th century before refills became standard.  My last visit I did notice a few little things that worried me the owners are not keeping up on maintenance - like a cracked flat screen tv - time to replace that since it has been in that condition since the time before when I ate there!  Overall though, I make a 40 minute drive out to Addison to have hot fresh sit-down Aurelio&#39;s pizza at this location.  My mouth is watering already! (get the thin crust with extra sauce - yum yum yum!)"

It&#39;s in a strip mall and does little to draw attention to itself. I even stopped in to get carry out here first , and didn&#39;t see how cool this place was. Once I stepped fully inside , It&#39;s charmingly cheesy decor hit me full force. They try to pull off a 1940&#39;s Italian neighborhood outdoor cafe feel , complete with gates , vines and lampposts. This is definitely not one of the trendiest places around, but at least it&#39;s not boring. There is a cool looking outdoor cafe , looked pretty nice but I never dined there.   
I have to say I&#39;m not a fan of the pizza , the thin crust isn&#39;t bad , but they put too much cheese and sauce for my taste. It is alright though , I&#39;ve just had better. The wife and kid on the other hand really like it , the wife even said it&#39;s the best yet in the area.What I do like ; the fried calamari (good) , the baked clams (very good) , the minestrone soup (good) , the Chicken Vesuvio (good), and the Meatball sandwich (good). There is also a lunch buffet , maybe even a dinner buffet (I&#39;m not sure) , I never had it.
I am not the biggest expert on Italian (Olive Garden is probably the Italian place I hit the most) , but this place is great for family&#39;s , they have good to very good food , friendly staff , and a Gigantic menu . If you accept the fact that it&#39;s not a place for a serious date , more of a hang out and family night out joint , I&#39;d be surprised if you don&#39;t think this place is at least pretty good."

It&#39;s a tacqueria/grocery.  I did not eat in the tacqueria portion of the store, but it had a number of happy familes eating lunch.  My husband commented that the chips and salsa looked good. The reason for my visit was to try the San Marcos tamales.

This was my second time in this place.  The first time I was looking for carnitas--that wonderful greasy roast pork delight that you can only find in Mexcian grocery stores. Because I&#39;ve had experience at other tacqueria/grocery places, I knew if they had carnitas, it would only be available on the week-end. San Marcos had the carnitas--and they were wonderful. 

I found the carnitas in the &#34;take-out hot food&#34; area located in the meat department.  Along with carnitas there were a variety of &#34;to go&#34; items. The store manager saw me at the counter and asked if I wanted a sample.  &#34;You betcha, I&#39;ll have a taste of that&#34;.  He gave me a generous portion and BAM I bought more.  While he was wrapping up this treat he mentioned that they usually have tamales available on the week-end.  Unfortunately, they were sold out.  What a tease.

So, the tamales led me to my second week-end visit.  Again, I did not eat in the tacqueria section, but noticed a number of happy families having lunch.   Now, I am an expert when it comes to tamales.  I make my own--both masa and filling.  And, when you make tamales--you can&#39;t make one or two--you need to make one or two hundred (usually with the help of my sisters).  To find a good tamale and not go through the work of making tamales would be a real gift.  San Marcos tamales--available in chicken or pork--did not disappoint.  The meat to masa ratio was just right!  I was given a choice of two types of salsa--verde and some orange- colored sauce.    When I almost bought a container of something that looked like pico de gallo, the manager appeared and asked if I would like a sample to try instead.  I appreciate being able to try something, liking it, and coming back for more instead of buying, hating it and never coming back. By the way, this was a nice salsa.  

So, my first and second visits were both pleasantly tasty.  I&#39;ll be going a third time, and this time I&#39;ll be eating in the tacqueria.  Gotta try the chips!"

Service is a little slow and seems they need more employees
They are very friendly though

They need to get a menu updated either on yelp, online, a website, etc... It took us about 10 min looking online to try and find one (but couldn&#39;t) then waited 10 min to get thru on the phone to have a menu faxed

I don&#39;t want to sound rude, but I had to repeat my order 3 times.

Next order of issue...the gyro was given to me with sauce on the side.  i never asked for sauce on the side.  That isn&#39;t what I ordered!  Ok, I&#39;m over that, but there is one thing that is completely unacceptable to me and that is cleanliness!  I was so grossed out about the cleanliness of the establishment.

The silverware container and the napkin holder had so much dust on it, I was disgusted.  

To further exacerbate the disgustingness, you could see all of the grease on the actual chairs.

The trash can area needed to be cleaned too.

The gyro meat almost had a rubbery texture to it and it had the over cooked edges, which caused me the need to dip it in more cucumber sauce."

I drove by on day number two and the lot was packed!  I knew I had to stop in to see what the deal was. Think burgers, hot dogs, fresh salads, spinach pie, gyros, Greek chicken and pork chops. Friendly staff both behind the counter and back by the grill!  

There are a lot of tables and chairs and everything was clean (I would hope so being so new!). The line was one deep when I arrived and twelve deep with about ten people waiting for their orders when I left. It takes a while to get the timing down, so we&#39;ll see how that eventually works out. 

I ordered the chicken breast plate with Greek potatoes. The woman who took my order wanted me to try the 1/2 Greek chicken. When I tried to figure out why since I wanted boneless chicken, she didn&#39;t really give me a hard fast answer.  What I know for sure is that my order took 29 minutes from receipt time to being handed my lunch. This was way too long for my liking. They felt badly and they were very kind, but they need more staff and more organization. They&#39;ll get there. Unfortunately, they forgot my pita bread, there were no utensils or napkins and the Greek potatoes weren&#39;t very good. But the chicken was AWESOME!!!  Juicy charbroiled chicken!  So good in fact that I would actually wait the 29 minutes for the same chicken again. 

So that&#39;s my first evaluation just four days into business. I hope they work out the kinks so I can get that yummy chicken again soon!"

We ordered the cheeseburger basket and the gyro platter.  The cheeseburger had a nice grilled taste, a bit on the thin side but overall very well cooked on an appreciated toasted bun.  The gyro platter was loaded with meat, onions, and a soft pita with a side of fresh cucumber sauce.  Very nice!  Fries came with both and were cooked to perfection.  Nice balance between softness and crispiness.  That&#39;s how I like em!  My best friend just moved into the area so we&#39;ll definitely be back.  Keep up the good work!

Please Note:  We hate leaving a sub-standard review since we have been fans of this place, be we feel we had to leave another fair review.

We arrived at 4:45 pm.  Wait time was only about 7 minutes.  No problems there.  Our waiter (young guy, maybe early 20&#39;s) was just fine. No problems there - brought us re-fills and two complimentary breads.

Our food (OVERALL) was a disappointment and for the amount we spent (upwards of $70), it left a lot to be desired. 

- Mother&#39;s 6 oz. Sirloin Steak was pretty bad.  She asked for &#34;Medium Well&#34; (with SOME red) and it came out clearly &#34;well-done&#34;, and was almost charred and tough.  It also had some funny taste, which we all picked up on.  

- I ordered the smaller-size cup of soup.  While the soup WAS GOOD, I barely got anything - literally.  The size of the &#34;cup&#34; was literally slightly larger than a small side cup which would hold tarter sauce or a side of salad dressing per se.  For 3.99, this was uncalled for.  This wasn&#39;t even enough to feed a baby.  

- My father&#39;s burger didn&#39;t taste well - he ordered the Bloomberg Burger which supposedly came with a side of onions.  They never came with the burger and we told the waiter about this who apologized and said that the burger indeed did come with those, and he did go and bring them out a few minutes later.

- We ordered a side of mashed potatoes which never came out.  We told our waiter who actually remembered this and even showed us he wrote it down on our order slip, so the issue came from the staff in the back.  Our waiter did bring us out our mashed potatoes then.

- I ordered a regular cheeseburger - this was GREAT.  No problems on my end.  However, the fries were overly salty.  

- My brother ordered fish tacos and he said they were good, no complaints on his end.

As stated, overall for what we spent we left disappointed, especially having been fans of this place for several years.  Two out of our four meals had issues, several side dishes seemed to be forgotten by the kitchen staff, and the portion of the soup bordered on a joke.  We are not expecting to come to a restaurant and spend McDonald&#39;s type money, but also don&#39;t insult people who come into a restaurant to spend hard-earned money on a holiday by being skimpy-skimpy.

We are unsure if we would return. We may send our review here to corporate, also.  Again, we hate to do this as we ARE/WERE fans of this Outback."

I was really craving a bloomin&#39; onion, so I dragged my boyfriend to Outback. We immediately ordered the bloomin&#39; onion and our meals.  The restaurant was not very crowded, but it took forever to get our food. The only good things we are were the onion and the potato soup. My steak was terrible. I ordered medium and it came out red while my boyfriends medium rare was only pink. I also had a huge vein/ hard white thing through the middle of my entire steak. We had to do surgery on it to try and salvage it. It didn&#39;t work out too well and became my dog&#39;s dinner when we got home. Service was inattentive and painfully slow. They were messing up orders left and right. I kept hearing them apologize to other tables and I think everyone got $8 off their bill for the bad experience that night. We will not be back.

My husband ordered a Sirloin steak, Med-well which was cooked to absolute perfection, so full of flavor and juicy and it came with a baked potato and ceasar salad. 

I ordered a breaded Chicken Sandwich that came with fries, while I ordered it completely plain, it was still amazing. I had to cut it in half in order to eat it because it was so big.

We don&#39;t send things back because if you charge this much for a piece of steak, it should always be cooked right. Not to mention it&#39;s a waste of time, yours and ours. Your first clue is when your customers say yes to the steak sauce when asked by the waitress. Speaking of our waitress, she was sweet but very forgetful. We&#39;re sorry we only left her a $25 tip but I based it on service and taste. Back to the steaks, that I could of easily bought at Jewel-Osco, then thrown on the grill, is a joke! I just don&#39;t get it. Does your restaurant not flavor or marinate any of your meats first? Is that what the salt and pepper shakers are for?

If it hadn&#39;t been for the fact that we had used a $50 gift certificate and didn&#39;t come out of pocket much for our meals, my husband and I seriously would have cried. The best thing I put in my mouth there was my two yr old son&#39;s mac-n-cheese.

A few nights ago, I went to this restaurant. I walked in and got seated nearly instantly. I took a look at the menu and saw that a picture of the Sesame Salad. I thought that looked pretty good. I read what was in the salad, just to make sure it was safe for me. I saw everything looked safe, but I wanted to ask what was in the vinagrette. (Please forgive my spelling). I ask my server for an allergen menu, and he says he doesnt know where one is. So I tried asking him if he knew what was in the vinagrette. He replied, &#34;I dont know, I just work here&#34;. That insta-pissed-me-off. I asked for a manager, and he came over. I asked for an allergen menu, and he came over with an outdated allergen menu. Like, REALLY outdated. He tried telling me their allergen menu is online, but it isnt. I informed him that it was only the nutrition and gluten free menus, to which he replied, &#34;Huh. Ill have to talk to corporate about that. Weird.&#34; So at least it felt like he was listening. So I asked him about the vinagrette since the menu was outdated. He found out from the chef and it was safe for me. I had the salad, and it was absolutely AMAZING. Ive wanted to go back just for that salad. It looked and tasted really freakin&#39; good. I highly recommend this salad. As far as the server goes, I know he got a talking to by the manager, cause we told him about the, &#34;I dont know, I just work here&#34; response. Manager cringed, which was pretty funny. But I mean, other than a poor server, great food, and a pretty good and attentive manager. Thank you Outback, I will be coming back fairly soon!"

I made reservations for 6:30, got there at 6:15. Waited 20 minutes for a table. Others that just arrived without reservations were told it was a 45 minute wait. So not too bad. 
Got a table, ordered drinks, waiter got that wrong and instead of asking if we wanted to order appetizers before he left to correct the drinks, he left to correct the drinks and so ten minutes later he&#39;s back with the right drinks. Then we get to order the appetizer, but not the entrees. More wait but he did bring bread to the table. When that was gone, he asked if we wanted more bread. We told him no but wanted refills on the drinks. He came back ten minutes later with more bread but no drink refills.
Then the appetizers arrived and we got to order our meals. Just two mistakes with that, forgetting the sides for two of us. We asked for them and he left to get them. I ordered the 12 ounce prime rib and struggled to cut it with what I thought was a dull knife but it was also the toughest prime rib I ever had. I asked for a sharper knife and got one but the meat was still very very tough. So I stopped eating it. When everyone else was done, the waiter showed up again and asked if I wanted a box for the remainder of the meat on my plate. I asked him, &#34;for what, to bury it?&#34; I told him it was the worst prime rib I ever had. He called the manager over to our table and the manager asked if he could bring me something else. I said no, because everyone else was done and the waiter never came back to the table while we were eating to ask how the meals were. I think they were very busy, too busy to check on us. So the manager had it taken off the bill. Which was good of the manager. But when I got the check I noticed that the waiter charged me for the 16 ounce prime rib not the 12 ounce that I received. So it was good that they took it off the check. But I will never go back to this place again."

On 1/2/2015 we decided since we were visiting our old neighborhood in Bloomingdale, IL we would have dinner at Outback. Big mistake! 

When we walked in it was standing room only and that is understandable for a Friday evening. I should have followed my instincts and left but the kids have never been to Outback so we waited. After being seated we were given a menu and it was 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. When she finally appeared we ordered appetizers, and our meal. Our appetizers arrived in 10 minutes, which was great but after still waiting for 50 minutes for our main course I told the family get your coats, I&#39;m paying for the appetizers and we are out of here. One of the other waitresses heard our conversation and suddenly our waitress appeared. She apologized for long wait and gave us a sad story on how they were &#34;slammed&#34; I told her people who were seated after us have already paid their check and left. She brought over the manager and he apologized and said our meal will be served in 5 minutes.

When the meal finally arrived the steaks were tough and flavorless; and the pasta dish was tasteless. We wasted close to 2 hours for this below-par meal.  Extremely disappointed."

I&#39;m giving it one star for the decent drink, a blueberry sangria.  I ordered the Outback special steak and it was a HUGE disappointment. It was cooked medium rare, how I asked it but it was terrible. Chewy, had no flavor. I ordered the sauteed mushrooms which were whole button mushrooms and they weren&#39;t good. Not what I expected. I also ordered the house salad which was just that, very basic. For 30.00 I ate a salad thats comparable to mcds house salad, warm bread with butter and a baked potato. Oh, the potato was good.

A steak house that doesn&#39;t know how to cook steaks!

At first entering into the restaurant the hostess is not welcoming, They look at guests as an intrusion of their time. Maybe, its more important to gossip and laugh about while customers decide if they went to the right place. 

After taking our name, It takes half an hour to be seated. We observed several  tables were empty, so after inquiring if we can get the one those empty tables, the response is:

                         &#34;oh we don&#39;t have servers for that table&#34; 

                                                      What!!! 

That goes to show that management is unable to utilize their staff or don&#39;t have enough help to cater guests. As a customer, you want to be treated well and feel welcomed, you really don&#39;t care if they have available servers or not, if management had a good sense of customer service they would make it happen immediately.

There used to be a time when restaurants earned your business, treated you with respect and made sure that your experience is such that you would talk about it with your friends and family. Over here, i just felt like a head count, another 50-60 bucks and thats it. 

Our server was nice, on time and attentive. Their timing on bringing in appetizers 
was within 5-10 mins (not too bad) and in the meanwhile our drinks were filled as soon as they were half empty. 

The french onion soup is one of the better ones I have had compared to others however, the steak is a different story. Poor cuts of meat and loads of liquid smoke is used to make your wood fire grill. The meat was dry and tough and had lots of fat on it. This is by far one of the worst steaks I have ever had. 

After our complaints; The Manager was apologetic and offered another round of steaks or free desert. Sorry, we don&#39;t really want more bad food. We respectfully, declined to both. Also don&#39;t give an expired appetizer card expect customers to return. Its a gesture at least you can BE NICE!. Sorry, Management is ineffective and needs some training in customer service.

If i was an investor at this location, I would seriously consider pulling my money out. Number one rule in restaurant industry is food quality and customer service  which they don&#39;t have so i wonder how long they would be open. 

This location needs to revise their business strategy and just call it:

Don&#39;t comeback

Which is exactly what we will do. I will take my business down the street to Jameson and pay for better quality and service than to waste my time and money here."

This was my first time to go to an Outback Steakhouse; hubby had a gift card and mother-in-law likes it for some reason.  I had checked online before going there and noticed they offer the option of &#39;call-ahead&#39; seating, which basically puts you on the waiting list to get a table around a certain time.  While I understand that it&#39;s not the same as a reservation, they need to explain the system better on the website (might avoid some angry patrons).  So this is what I learned: if you are crazy enough to go to this place on a Saturday, even for an early dinner time, put your name on the list for a time that is about a half-hour before you ACTUALLY hope to be seated.  When my mother-in-law walked in, she gave my name as being on the list and all they did was hand her a pager, no extra info offered.  My brother decided to ask about it and they told him it would be &#34;around 18 minutes&#34; (which ended up being 30).  Why did the hostess not offer this info when giving the pager?  Anyhow, it was insanely crowded for being 6pm, and nearly every person that came in walked back out after being told it would be over an hour wait.  Thank goodness there are stores nearby to walk around while waiting (that is where I sent my husband and our toddler).  The waiting area to be seated seems like a fire hazard and no solution of &#39;sit at the bar to wait if you would like&#39; or anything else is offered.  No one looks happy to work there, understandably.  
I&#39;m quite certain our waitress never smiled once while serving us, but she did do her job, so of course we still tipped her accordingly.  The food was just OK; I&#39;ve made far better steak at home from the supermarket.  It did come out very quickly, so I can give them credit for that much.  My drink, a margarita, was not all that great and arrived after appetizer, so minus points on that one.  Overall, very underwhelmed and will not return if up to me (it wasn&#39;t my pick in the first place)."
outback-steakhouse-bloomingdale,Melissa C.,Xyp0gvtJVWfRqSP7g4Tg7g,"West Chicago, IL",1,1,1,199,5,XxgoJ7U7mTJt0BnBFRm0PA,1.0,2014-06-14,"Honestly, it takes a lot for me to rate a restaurant at a one star. Actually, if I could, I would have given them no stars. It all started when we arrived for our call-ahead reservation. We came with my inlaws and fam to celebrate Father&#39;s Day....so there were 7 of us (including the kiddo). Now I understand the concept of call ahead, and that&#39;s it&#39;s a range of time. We did have to wait 20 minutes, however, when my mother in law called about noon to make the call-ahead, she asked for a specific booth/area because my two-yr-old toddler does well if she has a choice between a booth and a chair (ya...toddlers are special that way!). The person on the phone told her it was not a problem. Well when we got there, they were told that not only did we have to wait about 25 minutes, but that the seat that we had wanted was given away about 10 minutes prior to us arriving! So yes, irritating, but not deal breaking. 
We finally were sat, and one of my biggest pet peeves is when the waiter/waitress doesn&#39;t acknowledge our table within 10 to 15 minutes of sitting. I&#39;m not talking about taking a drink order, just a hi...I&#39;m you&#39;re servier...I&#39;ll be with you in just a few minutes. We didn&#39;t get acknowledge for over TWENTY minutes of sitting down! And than it took another ten minutes to get our drinks! By this time, we realized that if we were going to order our usual appetizers prior to dinner, we wouldn&#39;t eat for at least another hour, so we skipped the appetizers and ordered our meals. Myself and my mother in law got a salad/soup, so you figure that would come a few minutes after our order since it&#39;s like an appetizer. AGAIN with the 20 minutes for a simple salad! And my mother in law never got her soup! 
When the meal came, it was relatively decent, except for the fact that my mother in law&#39;s steak was way overdone. This was seriously the final straw. The server didn&#39;t even bring the food out, so I couldn&#39;t say anything to him. Yes, the cooking of the meal was not his fault (for once!), but there were no apologies or asking how things were. The manager tried to do what he could, but how can you remedy bad service?? 
Unfortunately this isn&#39;t the first time this has happened at this Outback. More often than not, there is usually a problem. Sometimes it&#39;s the service....sometimes it&#39;s the quality of food. Sorry Bloomingdale Outback....if it&#39;s up to me, we won&#39;t be back :/"

I have given this particular location over 3 chances...figuring the staff was just having an off few days. Whoever does the training at this location is failing and management must be blind or not care!

For starters, when my date and I walked in, the three hosts were in deep gossip, they eyed us over and made us feel like we were in their way! After waiting a minute for them to finish talking, we were seated. No one greeted us at the table for a good six minutes! By the time the server came by we just wanted to put our order in. He seemed irritated that we wanted to order our food with our drinks! The food was fine, standard outback food. It took forever to get our check. No one said goodbye to us as we left. Just overall, awful customer service by a bunch of ill-trained staff who do not want to be there.

HORRIBLE. NEVER AGAIN.

We made reservations days in advance, and they obviously overbooked because even with that my family had to wait just about an hour to get our table.

We put in our appetizers immediately, and got them in a fairly decent time. One of the appetizers was bad though, it was the avocado crab dip....I really think that the crab was spoiled or something. I couldn&#39;t even eat it. 

We had to wait an exceptionally long time for our meals to come out, even though the restaurant died down shortly after we had been seated. A manager never even came to our table to apologize for the wait or that the kitchen was backed up. Nothing. 

The only saving grace was that our waiter was very pleasant and handled everything to the best of his ability. 

I am exceptionally disappointed that a manager didn&#39;t even stop over to apologize to us, when I saw a manager go to several tables near by and even offer dessert to go on the house to other tables."

But more important than affordability is the joy of eating the pumpernickel bread. This is the best brown bread I ever had and it&#39;s free!!! To top it off, it is served with lots of butter. Outside of the free bread, I am a loyal fan of their baked potato soup. I rank their potato soup higher than Houston&#39;s. When I manage to carry on in the absence of potato soup, I order the creamy onion. I am not a real soup fan but I really enjoy theirs.

I have eaten at this location several times. This place is usually pretty packed on the weekends so absent using the call ahead seating option, plan to wait about 15-20 minutes. 

I enjoy their chicken on a barbie largely because it is well seasoned. I occasionally order the outback special or Alice Springs Chicken.  My sides of choice are the steamed veggies or sweet baked potato. Yes, I like potatoes.  :-)"

We have been here many many times and we have seen it go through some big changes recently. The waiting area has been remodeled and they have done a great job of separating the dining room from the waiting area. They occasionally bring out samples and have some water to sip on while you&#39;re waiting. 

The dining area is pretty much the standard outback look but they have clearly made an attempt at cleaning the place up and making it a little more intimate. 

The service can be hit or miss. The food is the same. On our past 3 to 4 visits, I would say our food was well prepared about half the time. 

We are a fan of the char grilled cooking option that gives their steaks a nice flavor. 

They are conveniently located near Stratford square mall so you can expect to have a wait on the weekends and in the evenings. 

In all honesty, the only other nearby steak option I&#39;m aware of is Jameson&#39;s and it&#39;s a matter of whether you want chain rest outback or a more elegant setting in Jamesons across the street. 

Pricing is reasonable...you can expect to spend about $40 for two people (without alcoholic beverages)."

I have been to Australia and there&#39;s nothing Australian about the food.  The down under theme is cheesy, but in a fun way.  They actually have pretty good steaks (6oz Outback Special steak @ $10).  All their sauces are homemade and compliment the meal very well.  The shrimp scampi came with a sauce comprising of 3 different types of mustard and other ingredients.  The &#34;Kookaburra Wings&#34; were fantastic with its secret spice rub.

We stopped trying other steak restaurants (for the most part) several years ago because, for the money, we are never disappointed with Bloomingdale Outback. I understand that it&#39;s not supposedly as nice to go to franchise places, but I really don&#39;t see spending any more for our meal, when we are very pleased with what we get at Outback. We always get a few certain dishes: My family loves the caesar salad and bread (and often get it to go for parties even), we think their prime rib is the best around for the price, we love their baked onion soup, I like the ribs or Outback special steak, and the kids chicken fingers are some of the best I&#39;ve had. 

Other reviews have complained about the service, but we go there at least 6 times a year for several years now, and not once did we wait for more than 2 minutes before someone greeted us. Maybe the others came at the busiest times? We try to go before the rush at 5pm or so, and we always sit in the bar tables where it is first come first served rather than waiting for an assigned table.

To be fair, I&#39;ve never cared for Outback but it&#39;s been years since eating at one so I got a gift card from my Discover card cash-back bonus and figured we&#39;d give it another shot. No thanks.

The thing is, the food wasn&#39;t terrible, it just wasn&#39;t worth $16 for a bland steak and four shrimp. I didn&#39;t care for the artichoke &amp; spinach dip either. My husband&#39;s chicken and ribs were just ok. The chicken itself wasn&#39;t anything better than I can cook myself and I can&#39;t seem to cook a good chicken breast so that tells you something. Had I actually had to pay for this meal out of my own pocket I would be pissed.

I think I&#39;ll stick to Lone Star, Longhorn, or Texas Roadhouse. There are so many other options out there, why do people keep coming here?"

Can&#39;t really complain about anything. Service was fast and friendly. If the place was dirty, I definitely couldn&#39;t tell due to the dim lighting. 

If there is one thing outback knows how to do its cook a steak. Probably from the volume of steaks they make, those guys do it perfectly right. When you order a medium, you get a perfect medium. I&#39;m ALWAYS satisfied with the way my steak is cooked. 

Even though I&#39;m pretty sure this place is the furthest thing from &#34;Australian&#34; fare. (I&#39;m also pretty sure there&#39;s no such thing.) This place is still a great place to go for a steak. Creamy onion soup was great too! 

Keep up the good work Outback."

Tonight six of us middle-aged moms got together, as we do every week.  Except this week we made the mistake of going to the Bloomingdale OutBack.  This is not an error we will EVER repeat.  Now again.. there were six of us.. all ordering appetizers, meals and alcohol.  If we had painted dollar signs on our foreheads it would have been more subtle.  Apparently another table complained that we were too loud for their sleeping infant and demanded a free meal.   Now I have never managed a restaurant, but I can do simple math.  Annoying the matriarchs of six families and loosing all of their potential future revenue, because you are cheesed off at having to comp a meal is NOT a smart business practice.  But that is precisely what Salomon Diaz, the &#39;Managing Partner&#39; (and ohhh yes I DID take his card) decided to do.  

The food was just all right and the service was unexceptional.  But considering how horrible the management is, I have to think that they were fighting an uphill battle.  We didnt let it ruin our evening - we actually laughed all the way home.  But if you are looking to have an enjoyable experience, avoid this place like the plague it is until they get new management."

The 4 ribs were placed on top of the 15 fries next to the 3oz chicken breast on the smallest dinner plate in Illinois.   Result - soggy fries, ok ribs and a bite of chicken. The waitress actually admitted the chicken was small (even for a child portion) and went back to the kitchen for another (just as small). 
Overall - terrible and a waste of money."

HOWEVER, tonight was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at this restaurant. 

We had a very nice waitress named Jessica who was great. After waiting for 30 minutes for 8 people&#39;s steaks (which seems like a normal amount of time for that amount of food), Jessica was carrying all of our food on a tray when she was bumped by another server. All 8 of our plates came crashing to the floor and my sister&#39;s coat was absolutely destroyed with ketchup splattered everywhere. She was obviously extremely apologetic, and cleaned it up quickly. 

However, the general manager came over, apologized and said that they would get our food re-prepared right away. We waited about another 25 minutes for our food, received our bill, and were SHOCKED to find out that the meal was STILL 140.00. The manager had not comped any single item on our bill. I don&#39;t mean to sound rude or greedy, and I have never worked in the service industry, but I was so shocked that they did not discount not even ONE item on the bill. I thought it was extremely rude and inconsiderate. If I were a general manager, I would have done anything I could to make the customer happy. At the very least, I would have brought out some desserts on the house. 

We still tipped Jessica very well because it clearly was not her fault. However, I am baffled by the general manager&#39;s actions. This would never happen at a high quality restaurant. It&#39;s not like one person&#39;s food was dropped, but 8 people&#39;s steaks and burgers, AND clothing was ruined. This Outback needs to be a lot more concerned with their customer service because this is a situation that should NEVER happen again. I can honestly say that I will not be visiting this Outback anymore. Very disgusted with the management. I hope this doesn&#39;t happen to anyone else. If it does, please voice your opinion and let them know that you should be receiving a discount for the inconvenience (something we mistakenly didn&#39;t do)."

They&#39;re freaking crazy because Outback is amazing. This one is my go to place for special events. I always have my birthday here as well as my family and I go here for father&#39;s/ mother&#39;s day. 

First of all, this one has a big parking lot as it is next to some big stores. Once you go in, you&#39;re hit with that aussie vibe that they all have. They hit you up with free and unlimited bread, though i&#39;d advise to stay away from that because I always get way too full too fast whenever I eat that. Bloomin Onion is really good. Outback specialty so I would suggest getting that as an appetizer.

As for the steak. on my birthday one year, I got a medium rare 12oz New York strip and it was the best steak I&#39;d ever had. You don&#39;t need to shell out extra cash for the filet mignon. I always get the loaded baked potato too but the garlic mashed potatoes are pretty good too. 

Go for your birthday and not only do you get a song, but you may also get a free brownie. Outback usually has some good specials, like 10$ meals or free bloomin onion coupon. Just got to wait for a good promotion if you&#39;re looking to save a few dollars.

Love this place. Has not steered me wrong yet."

When I asked for a refill on my iced tea, I was offered a to-go cup. When she went to go make it, she was unable to because they had already dumped all of the tea for the night.

I don&#39;t remember much about the food, which means it wasn&#39;t terrible but it also wasn&#39;t anything worth remembering. What I do remember is the delicious bread we got before our meal, and then I noticed something was moving on the bread tray and sure enough there was an ant casually strolling around our bread (which we had started eating at this point). We quickly called our waiter over to let him know. His reaction? He smashed the ant with his bare hand ON THE WOODEN BREAD TRAY. Thanks, now his guts are all over the tray, delicious! We then asked for the manager and explained to him what had happened. Instead of offering us a free dessert or something, he asks, &#34;well what would you like me to do for you?&#34; Um, idk, comp me a dessert? Do I really have to say it? We didn&#39;t say anything but it turns out he gave us all our steaks for half price which was nice but the whole experience was just odd and quite a turn-off. Haven&#39;t been to an Outback since."

Last night I tried the new Strawberry Waffle dessert......yummo.  Strawberries, creamy center, fresh made waffles topped with fresh whip cream and berries.  It&#39;s definitely my new favorite dessert.

The proprietor Sal Diaz is a great guy who gives back to the community.  He hosts a lunch for the Bloomingdale Chamber of Commerce and gives the money back to the Chamber to fund a $1000 scholarship from Outback.  We have a breakfast which all donors are invited and hand out the scholarship to their recipient.  Sal has been doing this for four years this being his fifth.....again he understands giving back to the community you work in.

Answer: never.

The steaks are consistently cooked the way they should be. I&#39;m always surprised when I order a steak &#39;medium rare&#39; and get it ... medium rare. Too many places out there cook medium rare on the well done side for some reason, and I&#39;m just afraid to order &#39;rare&#39; for fear of receiving something entirely uncooked.

The manager was nice enough to stop by and make sure everything was okay, and I appreciate that quite a bit. The suggestion from the server to order a dish &#34;light&#34; was also appreciated -- why get twice the butter when it tastes just the same without?

So after saying how great it is, why the three stars? Because it&#39;s just a consistent chain. Nothing has &#34;wowed&#34; me, there&#39;s no surprisingly good special or secret item on the menu, nothing that says &#34;gotta go back!&#34; any more than &#34;I can&#39;t decide, might as well go to Outback again.&#34; aaaand finally, there&#39;s one creepy creepster who has 324,281 pieces of flair on her shirt.

There are Australian artifacts and pictures all over the walls and the menu is full of Australian stereotypes. Outback has pretty much become a cliche because of all the commercials and that catchy Of Montreal parody. But who cares about that? What about the food? 

- Bloomin Onion
I used to order this. It&#39;s pretty much a large onion sliced into a flower, breaded, deep fried, and served with a creamy dipping sauce. It&#39;s tasty, but if you&#39;re like me and you&#39;re trying ot cut down on fatty foods, this isn&#39;t a good idea. I wanna live, dammit!

- The bread is good, and if you sweet talk the waitress enough she&#39;ll keep bringing more. It looks kind of like chocolate cake, but it&#39;s actually brown bread. 

- The steak is actually pretty good. I&#39;ve had the prime rib, which wasn&#39;t that great. They couldn&#39;t get it right one time and I had to keep sending it back. Recently I ordered the New York strip, medium. It was perfectly seared on the outside and juicy on the inside. My dad got a ribeye with a lobster/mushroom sauce on top, which was way too salty. The biggest steak they have is called the Melborne. It&#39;s 18 oz. of meaty goodness. Since that&#39;s almost 5 whole servings of beef, I decided to take a pass. 

Not the greatest steak, but pretty good, and pretty reasonable price. The 12oz steak was less than $20, and it came with two sides."

Its also not even close. The pita and the meat all taste fresh. 


The food was pretty good, but it is not the best option in the area. If you are willing to drive 2 more miles you can get to a portillos which in my opinion has better hot dogs and more options. The french fries were a little below average for what&#39;s around here and the hot dogs were good from what I can tell they use some good ingredients.

I counted 7 things on the menu including the 1 side which is french fries. What they do have is staples of most places. (Hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, Italian beef, Italian sausage, and gyros) I like to have options but some people may like this better. Unfortunately it don&#39;t even look like you can get cheese fries. 

The service was good. The gentleman behind the counter was very friendly. Probably about the best you can ask for.

Even though the taste of the food is not the best in the area the value on this place I think is where it redeems itself a bit. You get French fries with your hotdog and just guessing its equivalent to getting a medium size fries as McDonald&#39;s. You also get them with a sandwich order which is a good touch. A hot dog, soda and fries cost around 5 bucks. That&#39;s pretty good these days.

I hate rating things based on stars (cause it&#39;s all opinion based anyway) and you may think what I gave it is pretty low. I just think there are better options in the area if you can drive, however if you stop here I don&#39;t think you will be unhappy that you did as long as you can put up with the extremely limited menu."

Everyone here was super friendly. One of the owners took our order after introducing himself and shaking our hands. His business partner was working as a fireman that say so we didn&#39;t get to meet him. Some of the other staff members here are off duty firemen and cops as well. They explained to use that everything is fresh, never frozen, and made to order. My boyfriend and I both ordered hotdogs which came with fries on them. Similar to Gene and Jude&#39;s but not as greasy. Now I don&#39;t have to drive down to River Grove for a delicious hot dog. I want to try some of the other sandwiches on the menu like the gyro and steak sandwiches. The owner was even considering putting a salad on the limited menu. We had a great time talking with the staff. I can&#39;t wait to go back for more!"

I normally am not a fan of beef hot dogs but loved these and would return for them. Generous portions of fries. Hubs had the Italian Beef. It has a large portion of meat but was lacking a bit in flavor. The place was a bit dirty but we came around lunch on a Sat, so perhaps that is why. Also, seating is lacking for large groups. Had to pull 2 tables together but there was no place to sit when others came in at one point. Would also be nice if they offered a &#34;Kids Menu&#34; with maybe just a plain dog and a smaller burger and fry portions. Will return next time we are in the area."

One recommendation.   Rosens Bun on my burger was soggy by the time I got back home just 3 minutes later.

Then Kouzina came along.  Now you can find me there at least two days a week :)

At first I was hesitant, especially after reading a negative review.  I&#39;m so glad I decided to try for myself.  I&#39;ve been meaning to write this for some time now, wanting to encourage people to give it a try.

First the new ownership and service team is impeccable, very friendly and welcoming and always great attentive service.  They remodeled the place and it looks much better and is very clean and welcoming.  I have been seated in booths in the main dining area as well as at the smaller tables in the bar.

The bread is phenomenal, I&#39;d have to say it&#39;s my new favorite Greek bread.  Anyone who knows me knows that I judge a place by their bread, and in this regard Kouzina nails it.  It&#39;s freshly baked and has the crisp crust I look for, and the olive oil they offer has great flavor.  They will bring butter if you request it.  I could make a meal out of this alone. Well, this and one more thing...

The saganaki.  The show stealer is the saganaki!!  Insanely good!  Best I&#39;ve ever had, better than Parthenon and Greek Islands.  It&#39;s a higher quality cheese and the portion is the perfect size for individual orders.  Call me hungry but this is saganaki that I refuse to share.  Order it, you&#39;ll be glad you did.  And during the week it&#39;s half price if you eat it in the bar during a specified time period.  It&#39;s so creamy and doesn&#39;t turn to rubber like other cheeses I&#39;ve had.  The taste is fantastic- makes me salivate thinking about it.  Ugh, so good.

Everything I&#39;ve had here is top notch- my usual order is chicken kabob with Greek rice and a side Greek salad.  The chicken is so tender and cooked to perfection, and the grilled flavor is sublime.  The Greek rice is so good, great flavor with the sauce on top.  Goes well with the kabobs.  Their salads are enormous, cold, fresh and crisp, and their feta cheese is delicious.  A meal in itself.

I&#39;ve dined with others who have enjoyed the gyros platter, the salmon, and the Greek potatoes.  What a relief to have such high quality Greek food without having to drive to the city.

Kouzina, you saved the day!  Keep doing what you&#39;re doing.  You&#39;re now a permanent part of my rotation."

Now finding an entree will be the hard part. 
-Gyro is a standard go to, much better than the fast food places around. 
-I love the mussakka, always went home wondering why i ate so much... probibly because its soo GOOD!.
-personally when i feel like fish i like the sea bass, the whole fish broiled with latholemeno on top.. suclent 
-If im feelin lamb, ill go with the chops or loins. Again with that latholemeno sauce( you put that sh** on everything! (Cc franks redhot))

This place recently opened and I had to give it a try.  I went with my dad and we both got gyros.  I got the appetizer and he got the full meal  (I have pictures of both so you can see the difference).  We also had saganaki.  All was good.  The gyro meat was pretty much the standard; not amazing, but, not bad.  Saganaki also was as expected.  Service was fast and courteous.  4 stars for now and I will update as I visit more.

***Update.  Now 5 stars!  I have gone back a few more times since my first review and have always been very happy with the food and service!  I haven&#39;t tried all that many dishes.  I always get saganaki.  I have also had their gyros and hummus and Kouzina fries.  All tasty!  I will continue to try more dishes as I eat here more.  I&#39;ll keep updating with pictures and descriptions of the food.  My only gripe would be some items are a bit pricey; however, if they are cooked to perfection then the price is justified!  Service here is top notch!  I&#39;ve had at least 3 or 4 different servers / bar tenders and all have been amazingly helpful and provided a great dining experience!"

An embarrassment to Greeks everywhere. From cheese that was suppose to be feta with ragu sauce dumped on it.... To burnt souvlakia and fries underneath swimming in oil.

One good constant from the last owner is Zach, a server we really like. Wish I could say the same for the Moussaka and the menu in general under the new ownership.
Zach likes it! He&#39;s still got a review up here somehow??? There&#39;s even a picture of him standing by his new bar! 

Lunch prices seem high, and in comparison to dinner, dinner prices seem a little low for Schaumburg but I think they will be pumping drinks, more on that later.
Moussaka is $15 for lunch and $17 for dinner?
Big problem right away is that I don&#39;t like bechamel instead of the usual layer of mashed potatoes in my moussaka. The other problem is it wasn&#39;t half as good as the moussaka the previous restaurant was finally knocking out the last few years. Didn&#39;t like the clunky steak fries at all.
No octopus main course on the lunch or dinner menu? What kind of Greek Menu is that?
There is a small octopus appetizer. I like my own lamb, chicken and meat dishes better than most restaurants, so my test for a Greek restaurant is the moussaka and octopus, my octopus has really improved though.

I drank mass quantities of strong iced tea but saw a flyer on the way out with $5 cocktail specials on 4 nights. I can only imagine what a $5 martini tastes like in Schaumburg and am going to keep it that way.
Service was intelligent and attentive, we like Zach. Interior is tastefully toned down from the last owner, and so was THANKfully the droning Fox Noise in the bar.
If you are heading West, exit onto Plum Grove Road and then turn West on Golf when you leave.

Ok, I was disappointed and am not going back until the menu, and/or cook changes and hope Zach survives.
I took a chance on these average reviews. You can too, but I&#39;m not recommending it. 
Chances are very good they are going to need Groupon or other promotions so you might want to wait that out."

Tried it twice just to give it a second chance. Both times were overpriced in relation to the poor quality food. I don&#39;t mind paying up for quality but this was high prices and poor quality.
The Gyro meat was sub-par, I&#39;ve had far better at fast food places even. The sauce on the Pastitsio was terrible.The roast lamb was chewy and poor flavor.  I didn&#39;t bother with desert. I would think with the grand opening they would go high quality to match the high prices, unfortunately that is not the case."

That has never happened. Me and my boyfriend decided to try a different, new place. We sat down, I ordered a glass of iced tea, while my boyfriend went to the bathroom. We waited 20 minutes for the waiter to bring me my iced tea, and come and take our food order. He NEVER came back. Yes! I never got my tea and we decided to leave because we were both hungry and if it takes more than 20 minutes to bring me my drink, food was probably going to take 2 hours. Omg I have never been so disappointed at ANY restaurant. Even McDonald&#39;s. We are not complainers usually and we have never left a restaurant before. The tables next to us were also looking around and didn&#39;t look happy because none of them had their food and they were there before we came. It was just a chaos. I have never expected such disappointment even from the most average food place. The owner really needs to hire a lot more waiters or something else must be done, but this place&#39;s service is a joke compared to all schaumburg restaurants. I regret we even went there and wasted so much time."

The food was brought to our table nice and hot and it was all very tasty. That said I have a couple caveats. It was obvious that the Gyro meat served was not made in house. Also, the french fries were undercooked, they were still edible but they were definitely a little floppy. Finally, the restroom wasn&#39;t quite up to standards that I expect which are quite high. It&#39;s not that the bathroom was dirty or anything it just wasn&#39;t well-maintained and could have been cleaned a little bit better with a little bit more attention to detail. I&#39;ll probably come here again although the food was overpriced."

However, he won and I was OK with it. How hard could it be to mess up soup and salad??? So, he brings it home and we have dinner. Not even 2 hours later, and we&#39;re both sicker than ever!!! The only thing we had in common was the soup! 
Yes, food poisoning! Needless to say, we will NOT be coming back! Greek Islands in Lombard from here on out!!"

The saganaki was so flavorful and had that perfect crust and sizzle. Every part of my entree was delightful; the leg of lamb was just perfectly tender and oozing with juice, the potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the little side of vegetables was amazing- this is the first time I&#39;ve ever really enjoyed eggplant. It&#39;s a little pricier than I normally go for, but I think it&#39;s worth it."

Excellent again, Avgolemono soup over the top. Cream base with a good amount of lemon and rice, great start  with the warm bread.  Chicken lemononada was cook with a pan search, tender.  The artichoke and spinach with lemon suace was very well put together. Rice and tomato sauce done and good flavor. Really good with sauce. One of my favorites roasted veggies, egg plant, pepper,  okra, onion were roasted perfect, nutty flavors from roasting and spiced perfectly, try them. Service from Jenny excellent, a real treat."

We stopped going bcause the food went downhill.  I was excited to see the new one!
Driving past every day and finally seeing the Now Open sign we found a night to venture in.
Monday and not very busy.  Our server was very attentive and had suggestions at every course.
A warm loaf of bread was put on the table immediately with seasoned oil and a few kalamata olives (a nice touch).
Appetizer:  Saganaki and it was delicious.  Not too thick, perfectly melted.
My husband had a cup of the egg lemon soup and was licking the bowl.
I had a small greek salad filled with onion, tomato, cucumber, kalamata, lettuce and a nice chunk of feta on top with the perfect amount of a greek vinaigrette.
Entrees: 
Beef Kabob with roasted potatoes.  Ordered Medium and it came out prefectly pink.  Not dry at all.
Chicken, spinach artichoke with lemon sauce. rice pilaf (i finished every last grain)
Both served with roasted veg plate of okra, onion, eggplant, zucchini, garlic, pepper and tomato.
The owner, Charlie, was at the front the whole time and greeted us / shook our hands on the way out.  
Classy way to start a new business and make people feel welcome."

However I decided to check it out for myself anyway. And boy am I glad I did! The food was wonderful, the service was good, and the atmosphere was enjoyable. I am first generation Greek so I do the difference between real and generic and this was real. I had the combination plate and enjoyed it immensely. My dinner mates both ordered the same thing which was grilled calamari. I did not try it but it sure looked good and they both said it was. I know I will go back!"

I was excited at the thought of a Authentic Greek restaurant coming to Schaumburg but unfortunately Kouzina is not it. I love Greek food. It&#39;s delicious flavored and spices are stapled on the food but here it was like they had never had it before. I ordered 2 things: melitzanosalata(eggplants dip) and pastitchio(Greek lasagna). I&#39;ve had both these at many restaurants in Greektown,Chicago and love them but at Kouzina they just weren&#39;t authentic. The taste of the melitzanosalata was weird as if it had a lot of mayo in it or something. Also, it was bright pink??? Never had it pink. The pastitchio tasted like chef boyarde spagettios. I&#39;m not joking the only thing about this place was the service and they all spoke geek and we&#39;re professional. I suggest that, if you have the time, go to Greek town and any of the restaurants in there are 10 times better thank Kouzina"

I selected the &#34;HOT&#34; spicy option on the on-line menu when ordering.  Also, this was weird but the hot mustard that comes with the House Egg Roll came out of the packet in a gelatinous form; mucus like that you would see on an egg white right out of the shell except yellow.  A thorough mixing did not improve the consistency.

I am hoping this is a one-off in food quality."

I had forgotten my lunch, so he said he would share his with me as he had ordered enough food for two meals.  I rode along with him to go pick it up, and we asked the woman at the register if it would be ok for us to eat the food there, as I had decided to come last minute, and she was very reluctant to let us sit at a table.  She explained that the tables were meant for servers to attend to and that it wouldn&#39;t be right since we ordered takeout.  Now, there was not a single customer in the restaurant besides us so it&#39;s not as though we would be taking up valuable space  Finally, she grudgingly said we could, but warned us not to do the same thing next time.  Ok lady, fine.

We picked up the food and started walking toward the back corner of the restaurant in an attempt to be more inconspicuous for the sake of the woman&#39;s concern.  As we started to go, she shouted, &#34;Nuh-uh-uh-uh-uh!!  This is not a McDonald&#39;s, you can&#39;t just take your food anywhere!  That area is for the servers!&#34; and she tried to usher us into some seats in a special party room near the front of the restaurant.  At this point I said, &#34;No, I think we&#39;ll just leave.&#34;

I am appalled at the rudeness of this woman.  &#34;This is not McDonald&#39;s&#34;?  She acted as though we had brought food in from another restaurant and tried to eat it there.  We bought the food from HER, why would she treat her own customers like that?  Not to mention, we probably would have ordered at least something to drink from the server, and definitely would have tipped.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be going back again."

For years, whenever we got Chinese food, we&#39;d go to another favorite spot of ours... until this year. My parents had recently started coming here for dinner and wanted to do Christmas Eve here. So we did.

Well, it was packed. We didn&#39;t have to wait for a table, but service wasn&#39;t the fastest. I think we were there for about two hours.... which was kind of long. After appetizers, I think we were all ready to leave. At least the servers were friendly and cracking jokes!

Service aside, let&#39;s talk food. For an appetizer, I had the calamari, which was good but just a bit chewy. For dinner, I had shrimp fried rice and chicken chop suey. SO GOOD. My family all enjoyed their dishes too. However, the portions were so huge I could barely eat a few bites in each dish before I was stuffed. And get this -- EACH of us at the table had one or two large dishes. Needless to say, there were PLENTY of leftovers. Word of advice if you eat here: order food with the intention of sharing unless you want enough food for a few meals. 

Now, although there was a huge bill that night (five people, multiple plates and appetizers), the price per dish was pretty good. My shrimp fried rice was about $9 and the chop suey under $13. 

Fortune cookies accompanied our meal. The fortunes are kind of hit or miss, but I don&#39;t make a big deal out of those.

Definitely a good Christmas Eve dinner!

[Well, this is my last review of the year. 
2015 was an interesting year!

I must say they were very fast.
So why was the food cold my guess is as good as yours.
Egg rolls were good best part of the meal.
The sauce on the ribs and BBQ pork was awful .
I think my wife spent more time in the bathroom than eating.
The beef fried rice was swimming in Grease .
The chow fun noodles were all cold and stuck together.

He tried to get me to come in for their lunch specials but I said that I will just try it another time.  
Lesson learned, call first. 
In fairness, I have nothing against the restaurant/owner/workers there.  I really shouldn&#39;t rate them because I didn&#39;t dine there or order takeout, but I have to give a rating in order to post, and warn other diners that may see the reviews here and read about the Sunday buffet.

At 8 p.m., still no food, so I called again. Was told there were no delivery items out, so the driver must be out with it, and it would be here within 45 minutes. The guy didn&#39;t even check/know where my order was, and obviously didn&#39;t care to check. At 9:10 p.m., still no food. I was told that the driver was back out delivering orders - again, the guy would not even check on my order and was giving a generic answer. I explained how long we had waited. No offer for amends, no sincere apology. I canceled the order. Ten minutes later (about the time it takes to drive from their location to my house), the delivery guys shows up. I tip him and start to explain what happened and ask that he let his management know, and as I am speaking, he turns and walks away. 

I understand that NYE is busy. What I can&#39;t stand is bad service at anytime. If they tell me an hour and a half and I give them two hours...I expect the service they promise. If they had told me a three hour plus wait at the beginning and I accepted that, I would have been okay - but to not keep their word, not specifically check on my order when they were called, make up stories about their delay and mistake, not sincerely apologize, and send some rude kid to deliver my food that gets a healthy tip and walks away while I am speaking? Unforgivable service at ANY time."

I&#39;ve been going to this place for years (it was once known as Munch Inn, which is now the name of an inferior restaurant in Arlington Heights). Great Mongolian beef, fried rice, pineapple chicken, egg rolls, egg foo yung, beef with pea pods, and sweet &amp; sour chicken. The crab Rangoon is the best I&#39;ve ever had---a must order. The governors chicken and empress chicken are also very good. They also now have a Filipino menu, and the Shanghai egg rolls (smaller but you get about 12) are great with the sweet dipping sauce. 

Mary and Danny are the owners, and they are fantastic. They are always there and are the backbone of the restaurant. Very nice and attentive. We almost always order out, but we&#39;ve eaten there a few times and the interior is very nice. It&#39;s fairly large and visually pleasing to the eye. It&#39;s located in a great neighborhood and there&#39;s ample parking.

They are a bit pricey, but you get quality and quantity in return, so I can&#39;t complain. Typically, we spend about $35-$40 for a family of four. You get frequent flier coupons that allow you to eventually get free egg rolls, fried rice, etc. All in all, this is the best Chinese restaurant in the northwest suburbs."

The restaurant was fairly empty, and service was fairly prompt. Servers were polite, though knew nothing about the Philippine items on the menu.

Started with egg drop soup, which was bland and salty. Moderate egg, and no onions! Tea was OK, not too strong but decent basic black flavor. Both soup and tea were served nice and hot.

I ordered Mongolian Beef, since I haven&#39;t had this in a couple years and she said it was good. [Didn&#39;t test the Philippine foods since she couldn&#39;t really tell me much about them :( ] The portion was huge, with an enormous helping of rice, and a piece of tempura chicken.

The beef was OK, but very salty (expected in Chinese food), and the rice was very mild. Beef served over rice noodles added a nice crunch to the dish, which otherwise was very basic. Food was served hot and fresh.

Friend ordered Egg Foo Young. Again, large serving with a lot of rice. Said flavor was OK, but not as good as two places he mentioned which he often visits. (I don&#39;t recall the places he mentioned, which are in Mt Prospect) He took one bite of the tempura chicken, and left the rest.

Prices seemed a little high, but not too bad for the portion size. Service was decent, but there were only four tables to be served, so can&#39;t comment on lunch or dinner times.

May come back for the Philippine Buffet, but the Chinese was not worth the trip - and we live across town. :( Servers need to be familiarized with the menu items, or have a brief description in the menu!"

Let me start off by saying I&#39;ve been getting takeout and sometimes dining in at House Of Szechwan for the better part of 3 years. I primarily order the Mongolian Beef lunch special. Now all up until recently it was delicious and I could justify the $9 price tag. Beef was real tender and had a bunch of flavor and their fried rice that&#39;s included was good as well.

Over the course of the past 2-3 months they have definitely changed their provider for the beef. It&#39;s horrible now and just to make sure I didn&#39;t get a bad batch I gave them 3 tries over a few months. It&#39;s just downright garbage now. It almost seems as if the beef they are using are leftover scraps. Full of fat, and weird cuts of meat that taste absolutely horrible. Before the change every piece of beef was lean with no fat and tasted great. Now not so much. This was the last and final straw for House Of Szechwan for me. I&#39;ll stick to my local Chinese place that consistently puts out good food at much cheaper prices and gives you a much larger portion."

The crab rangoons were probably my favorite. The mongolian beef &amp; governor chicken were alright--nothing spectacular. The lo mein needs some major work! The noodles were extra thin and the sauce was not what I expected at all. I&#39;m used to a dark broth but this was clear and somewhat slimy. My biggest complaint is that this place was expensive which is not what one expects when it comes to Chinese food. There are about 5 other restaurants between my home &amp; HOS that I can get the same quality for less.

There is a filipino buffet every Sunday from 12-3pm for $12.95 per person. There is a coupon out online for $2 off a person for up to 8 people til 8/31/12.

This filipino buffet is by all means one of the better ones out there not to bad name other restaurants. But a buffet is a buffet, it is what it is. I was still excited though since it was a pinoy buffet and I wanted to see what they had to offer.

I came here with my brother, cousin, and godson. We scoped out the buffet asap. They had regular white rice and garlic rice(needs a bit more garlic). They had shanghai egg rolls which were tasty and big veggie egg rolls. Some of the main dishes include: Sinigang(sour soup), pancit(noodles), chicken appretada(chicken with potatos), bangos (fried milk fish), beef with ampalaya(beef with bitter melon), lechon kawali (pork belly), and beef kaldareta(beef stew). For dessert they had chinese cookies, fried donuts, and turon.

My fave dish here was beef and ampalaya and the sinigang. Everything else was decent but not over the top wow. Overall a good buffet.

Anyways, I cannot say anything about the buffet or eating in, but I have gotten take out more times than you can shake a stick.  They are consistent and quality.  The most important thing, is they are knowledgeable.  When I call and ask what ingredients are in certain dishes, they are honest and know everything to a T.  For example, I recently discovered I have higher blood pressure, so we have been cutting back on our sodium and MSG and ordered no salt no MSG the last time.  After I requested an order of egg foo young, right away the person on the phone warned me that the egg foo young sauce already has MSG in it.  It was kind, courteous, and I was very grateful.  

As far as food goes, my favorite thing to order is the orange chicken, as it is crispy and full of flavor.  My main complaint is that the orange chicken has noodles at the bottom, when I wish they was more chicken.  My life is a big fan of their beef and broccoli. 

Based on my review so far, you may be wondering why I only ranked it 4 stars - this is due to the fact that when you order from here, you end up paying double compared to most other Chinese places.  I&#39;m not sure it is worth the extra cost, but I still pay it.  Especially for those dang crab rangoons..."

Not really feeling this place..... The food is definitely under average and our waitress never came across our table to check up on us or give us refills on drinks and still charged us $28 for tip. What a rip off! I should have expected that from an Americanized Chinese/Filipino joint. At least the nice elder man was consistent with clearing the table of any mess. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be showing up here ever again.

We ordered Philipino deep fried egg rolls (good) and prawns, pork and breadfruit in a coconut sauce over rice (interesting).   

The place is nice enough inside (typical Chinese).  

The service was indifferent and rather unprofessional.  The waitress didn&#39;t seem interested, delivered the check before we were done with our meal and didn&#39;t bother to ask if we wanted another drink or dessert.  At the end she proceeded to stack all the plates and silverware at the table before carting it all off.   Left a bad impression;   a  poor way to end the meal.   

This is NOT the best Chinese place I&#39;ve been to.  Because of the indifferent service I probably won&#39;t bother with it again."

The egg drop soup left much to be desired.  Not enough pieces of egg white, not a single green onion in it at all, and kind of bland. 
The crab rangoon was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had,  And the veggie egg rolls were fantastic!  Except for the bottom bite that had been sitting in the bottom of the container that was literally dripping in grease (but grease is to be expected with Chinese food).  
All in all, pretty good and I would order from here again."

We went at 7:30 on a Saturday night and the place was packed. Yet we were seated right away and had good service and the food was great. I went with the advice of others and ordered the crab Rangoon and it was the best I ever had and I have had Chinese food all my life all over the country. We also had the orange chicken and Mongolian beef. Both were excellent!  I had the fog cutter drink and it should be called the put you in a fog. I highly recommend you try it if you want a strong drink. I added pictures of crab Rangoon and orange chicken.

The complimentary Egg Drop Soup was to our table as soon as we sat down, and was very, very palatable. Their white and fried rice has yet to be under or overcooked, and the meat (I&#39;ve had shrimp and chicken) and vegetables are pretty solid. Some of my cooked vegetables have been a bit undercooked and/or close to raw, but the flavor more than makes up for it.

Long waits, sticky tables, bad service, and cold food have seem to become the norm. Last night my dining experience took about 2 hours for appetizers and an order of fried rice! Server waited on another customer while taking my order. We asked that the sticky table be wiped down; the bus person went to the wrong table, interrupting the family that sat there. Beverages arrived only after server was reminded twice, and after the cold appetizer platter arrived. An order of fried rice arrived a half hour after the appetizer and predictably cold. Overall bad wait service and long waits for cold food made this a bad and final dining experience at House, but it is the culmination of several such experiences over the past year or so.

The chicken fried rice was flavorless, the empress chicken was soggy and flat out weird. The crab Rangoon was a giant load of cream cheese.

Their saving graces:

-They deliver
-They have mailer coupons... Usually for free egg rolls with delivery or a discount if you dine in. Why should I only get the discount if I dine in? Am I not still a customer if I order take out!? STOP TRYING TO FORCE ME TO SIT IN A RESTAURANT IF I DON&#39;T WANT TO DAMMIT!
-They restaurant is decent on the inside
-It is close to mi casa (a special yay for that! manders can be a lazy little lady when it comes to food... so the closer, the better)

Clean, exellent service, pleasant music not too loud, extensive menu.  Everyone chips in to clean tables regardless of if it is their section.

Egg rolls - delish, not greasy, just right crispness, perfect balance of ginger
onion pepper tomato beef- very good
orange beef ordered mild was still a bit spicy but quite flavorful

Each of our entrees was betw $10-11 but we took home enough for lunch or dinner the next day.   Will likely order delivery next time and try more of their menu.

of note: &#34;complete dinner&#34; - $2.50 added to  each entree for wonton soup and eggroll to accompany meal.

If you eat in restaurant for lunch, or order a full dinner, you&#39;ll get soup and tea.  Make SURE you get the Wonton soup, which is really good - as others have said though, the alternative is definitely not for everybody, and I found it pretty gross.

The tea, along with the rest of the meal, has always been really good.  Portions are large, and I never feel like the food had been sitting out prior to my ordering it.  

The owners are incredibly nice here, and I&#39;ve never found the service lacking.   The meal seems to move at whatever pace you&#39;d like - I&#39;ve had dinner here in under an hour when in a rush, but I&#39;ve also spent substantially longer if catching up with friends or family.

The food that they make tastes fresher, is less saltier, and more presentable. I do like their Chicken with Broccoli dish with steamed rice, and their potstickers (dumplings) and egg rolls are edible. The only other place that I can think of in the immediate area that is better, in my opinion, is Chef Ping in Schaumburg. Now that place is always packed and the service is quite excellent. But back to House of Szechwan, my friend did supposedly have a bad experience here once about a year ago. His order had a small clump of about 5 black hairs that was in his food.

What I REALLY HATE is the price. $9.45 for a 10 piece chicken nugget meal. Are you kidding?!?! Almost ten bucks for McDonald&#39;s?! I&#39;m never coming back, that&#39;s for sure. I just thought I&#39;d stop by the mall to kill some time with my son. By no means am I a cheapskate, but for $10 I would rather have taken him to Subway for a fresh sandwich.

We came on a week night and it was not too busy. We were told we could sit wherever. We had read reviews before going and most said the service was not that great. Our waitress was very friendly! We did feel like the service was a bit slow and lacked some organization but we realize this place just recently opened so cannot really blame them! 

The food was excellent!! We shared the Drunken Pigs and Artichoke Spinach Wontons and were satisfied with both! We then split the Thai Flatbread and Southern Burger--and loved each as well! The drinks were also great and our waitress didn&#39;t even hesitate to make us something that wasn&#39;t on the menu that we had requested! 

The atmosphere like an old Pub, although I might choose some different lights to fit the old-time feel of the restaurant more. They also had some kind of stereo and empty boxes near the kitchen entrance that they should try to cover somehow. Again, we weren&#39;t really that bothered by it as we know they are still perfecting everything.

Overall, a hit!! We&#39;ll definitely go back! We&#39;d recommend this place and are hopeful it stays around!! Cut them some slack--they&#39;re new...they&#39;re working on making things JUST right!"

I try to stay in tune with what is going on in our hometown, so when I heard that the old Papa Pacino&#39;s formerly Bartlett Tavern &amp; Grill was reopening with a slightly twisted concept, I knew we would be in there pretty quickly to give it a try. Earlier today, I heard from one of my best sources for local news (BAM&#39;s!!) that Platform 18 Tavern &amp; Grill was planning a Grand Opening Party for 09/12/15. I don&#39;t like to wait, so I called and learned their doors were open and they were ready to show us what they&#39;ve got! 

Parking. There is no street parking immediately in front of the building. But there is a lot right behind the building and street parking around the corner as well. It&#39;s just a few short steps around the corner and we don&#39;t pay to park in Bartlett, so that&#39;s a plus right there.

When we walked in, we were greeted by a man and a woman sitting at a table right inside the door. They were definitely talking business and before long, I realized the gentleman was likely one of the managers. We scoped out the TV situation since we had our choice of tables. Every TV had something different on, so we quickly chose a spot in the middle where we could pretty much see them all. 

Our server arrived with menus and took our drink order right away. I can&#39;t imagine they have been open for more than a few days, so the menus seem to be temporary. Copied sheets of paper with tiny font that was pretty light. I didn&#39;t mind too much, but my husband was tilting the menu toward the light from the front window to be able to read the details. I think it&#39;s likely that the menu is still in flux which is why it didn&#39;t seem very permanent yet. They also run a Happy Hour Menu on Tuesday through Friday from 5-7pm with sips &amp; bites. I could have easily made my meal off those bites, but instead I opted for the pair of chicken tacos and he ordered a bowl of chili to start things off. 

His chili arrived along with my tacos. His chili was perfect. Exactly what he expected but better!  It included ribeye and pork shoulder both of which added to the nice texture. It was definitely a quality starter dish. I had ordered the tacos without the queso fresco. Our server had showed us the printed happy hour menu which outlined the toppings since all of those details weren&#39;t posted on the wall. Needless to say, the tacos arrived with the queso, but after our server talked with the manager, he stopped by, apologized and explained she had put it in the system, but their system didn&#39;t print it out for the kitchen. He fixed their system and minutes later, I had fresh, hot chicken tacos sans queso in front of me. They were worth the wait. They use two warm corn tortillas, chicken breast, onion, cilantro and a tomatillo salsa. For $5, the portion was very fair with plenty of chicken. The onion and cilantro were a little heavy handed, but the salsa complimented the chicken quite nicely. 

We both chose a burger and fries for our entree. They offer multiple varieties of fries - duck fat, bacon fat, truffle oil or plain. We wanted to see what their plain fries tasted like before getting too creative. Plus, both of our burgers already had bacon on them, so no need to overdo it during the first visit. The coleslaw is super pretty. A bright purple cabbage. I am not a big coleslaw girl, but it was good. We liked the plain fries and dipped them in some BBQ sauce to jazz them up. The burgers were served on nice buns. Definitely not wimpy burger buns. The bacon was perfectly cooked. My onion straws were more like seasoned onion petals/large pieces, and they were really good!  Every portion that hit the table was just right. Maybe too many fries, but better to have too many rather than not enough. 

The price was right. The food certainly had some unique twists on the menu that I can hardly wait to try over time. The server was sweet and kept our glasses full without having to ask her to do so. And the manager owned the error whether it was the server, the chef or actually the manager&#39;s fault. I appreciated how he handled that hiccup. Go give them a try. I&#39;m looking forward to hearing what you all think too!"

Especially because we live down the street but also because Bartlett needs a good pub with great food. The food has been good, not great. But for convenience sake, we keep coming back. After multiple openings and closings, they can&#39;t seem to figure out how to do business. We went there today (a Sunday) at 1:30 for some football and burgers, and they were closed. Inconsistent is the name of the game here. Get it together, Bartlett needs you."

Interior.
As soon as my husband and I walked in, we were surprised how  little had been done to the dark interior that never impressed us as the business went through several changes in the last years.  Why is this place still so dark?  Now that they have new menu, it does not do the chef any service that you can&#39;t see his food.
Still same noisy bar atmosphere with video gambling machines.

Menu
Now focusing on small plates is a nice touch.  Menu had various flatbreads, burgers, sandwiches and &#34;large plates&#34; (which are full entre meals).
The menu is small so when we were told there was no flatbreads, that was basically 1/5 of the menu that was gone.
My husband order the chicken large plate and orders the spinach w/o garlic and was prepared accordingly.  I wanted a flatbread, but instead ordered the BBQ chicken salad w/o olives... it came w olives.  No big deal, it was tasty but more like a lunch size portion.  So dark, it was hard to really see all the ingredients.
No dessert offering.
And sadly, no Friday fish fry.

Summary
All in all, its still a bar that just offers nicer appetizers than before.  I was hoping if would be a restaurant that had a good liquor menu, too bad.  I wish them luck, as I hope they heed the comments of all the reviewers.  Perhaps I will return once they improve, but as of now, I couldn&#39;t recommend it to any of my friends."

When we arrived at 530 there were not many people there; however, it took a long time to order drinks. We then had to get our server to order dinner at about 610. That&#39;s a long time to wait to order food. We all ordered soup and an appetizer which then took 20 mins to get. Our food came out just a few minutes into the soup. The soup was great but most of our entrees were mediocre at best. It did get crowded and with only two servers the service was slow, but if the food was fabulous that might have been ok. Maybe it was an off night for them but don&#39;t think I would try it again. There are other Bartlett restaurants that are so good. Also overheard servers saying by 630 they ran out of several items on their menu which isn&#39;t that big to begin with."

They ran out of Rock n Rye, which I loved in my Old Fashioneds I ordered there.  I would go simply for those drinks and now I couldn&#39;t have one.  Lame.  The soup I tried was very ordinary and the truffle fries were amazing.  But nothing else on the menu excited me. Too heavy on the meat and fried items.  No food or drink specials.  No music playing (unless you want to spend all your drink money playing songs on the jukebox).  Close to empty and just not a fun vibe on a Friday night.  Used to be much better. Simply put it is now quiet and lame and I am close to done.  Why is it SO DIFFICULT to find out how to run a decent bar?  HINT- decent music and drink and food specials for starters!

My bf and I went there three times over the course of the last 6 weeks. Saturday nights. First time was great. They were fairly busy.  Good food, great service, amazing old fashioned(s).  Second time.  My food was not good (ordered the pulled pork, same as the first)  Overdone and presented differently. It tasted so different as well. BF loved his flat bread. Drinks were a-ok again.  The issue was our server. Brought us our drinks and our food but never saw her again. Never even asked how it was. Had to flag down a server who told us she wasn&#39;t going to BE our server at the beginning of the night because she &#34;had kids to get home to.&#34; (after she cleaned the table because it was filthy) Uh ok. Got our tab she said &#34;make sure it&#39;s right because I&#39;m just going off of what I saw in front of you.&#34; Had cash out with the bartender because, again, no one was coming to grab our money.  Mind you, there was a server at the beginning that had her tab walked out on because she came and asked us if we were &#34;her two beers&#34;. Then proceeded to tell us she was walked out on. Sorry? Third time we were there.  Why a third time? Because that&#39;s our rule and it&#39;s literally right down the street from his house. And I swear there is potential. Promising, as this was the same server from the first time.  Nope.  Both ordered burgers (asked for med got super well done. Like CHARRED) and old fashioned(s). Got Whisky Sours?  Ordered a second drink, came out in a glass half the size of the first glass.  Not cool. And it was a Whisky Sour AGAIN.  Had to flag down the server.  I don&#39;t understand because there are so many girls working and they aren&#39;t that busy.  They were busy the first time. I promise you, I am being fair in my review and I hate to do this because I have a business myself but three times and 2 of those times were terrible? This place has the potential to be good.  I really think so.  There is def a disconnect between management and staff.  I have some opinions on that but I&#39;m not sure if the guy we saw there twice drinking and schmoozing was management/owner or not. I hope they figure it out because it can be good!"

Reading a couple of reviews here and some on FB, I was a little hesitate to give this location another chance.  

However, the food is excellent and the beer menu can be found no where else in Bartlett.  Finally, a place where you can get good food and good beer close to home.  I can only speak for my experience but the service was friendly and fast.  I had a burger and it was cooked perfectly.  Most places have no clue how to cook &#34;medium or medium rare&#34; but they were spot on.  The drunken pigs are one of a kind and worth the visit if just to get those.  

I realize some long time Bartlett folks might be turned off as they are expecting another hole in the wall with lite beer specials (which they have), but keep an open mind and try something different.  Food that is familiar, yet creative. Craft beer!  Can&#39;t find such a good selection at any restaurant close by.  Give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed.  

My only negative comment, the slot machines (while probably profitable and likely attract regulars) are a tacky feature.  I know establishments see this as revenue but it distracts from what could be a one of a kind place in an area hurting for it."

When my husband and I first sat down it was crazy busy. The bar was packed for happy hour. The waitress had trouble getting to the table. Which ok ill excuse that. Not even  ten minutes after we were seated the place cleared out. There were three servers and a bar tender which was enough. Our waitress was standing by the bar looking at the restaurant  not doing anything but when you would make eye contact when you needed her she would walk away. The otheer two young waitress  were great busted it they were serving, taking orders,  backing the bar  and budding their  own tables.  The food was great though my husband and I had a burger and fries. I ordered  the truffle fries which were amazing and my husband had the bacon  fat fries which are      sooooo good there naughty.  The restaurant  does need a really good deep cleaning. Their decorations were very ... umm a good try. They were trying to go for a repeal prohibition  feel. Which is a great idea but they wanted wood crate  liquor boxes so they wrote gin  on a paper box.... for the decorations they could have taken another  $40 and finish the look... looked cluttered not cute. All in all great local  burger,  cute atmosphere love the idea need to execute  The vision a little better and ok service (potential  to be great)"

Both of us had burgers so you can&#39;t really go wrong. My husband had cream of broccoli soup which was very bland. This is the second time we&#39;ve been. First was when they just opened so we understand they were working their kinks out but this time was after they were closed for a month fixing their HVAC and according to their statement &#34;working on customers comments &amp; complaints&#34;. We had the exact same experience both times. We had to get our own high chair, no big deal, but then they just left the chair it replaced in the middle of the tables, creating a very awkward situation for other customers. We ordered drinks and hen it came time for refills we had to wave down the other server because our server never came back except to bring our food then ultimately our check. It got busy as we were sitting there but you still have to pay attention to all your guests. The slot machines take up too much room. If you&#39;re trying to create a bar/restaurant you want people to come back to you at least have to be able to accommodate them. I can honestly say we will probably not be back.

So excited for a new restaurant in Bartlett. Based on articles in DH and Trib, walked in and we were kind of disappointed that the interior of the restaurant hadn&#39;t changed at all, other than a fresh coat of paint and new signage. Kind of busy, but was able to get two seats at the bar, felt very comfortable. Two large, flat screen TV&#39;s, Cubs game on. Approached by bartender Katie (no smile) for first drink, but had to ask for menus (was given one, had to ask for another). Menus on paper (enough said)  from then on, had to ask for everything. No explanation of happy hour specials, for food or drinks. In fact, after the first drink, Katie never returned to ask if we wanted another drink or to see how we were doing. Poor service. 2nd round initiated by us. Was shocked as to how the Katie treated the other waitresses. Very degrading. We ordered the sliders, fish tacos and trio of fries. The food was served on small trays, which is fine, as long as you are given a plate to eat off of. No plates were offered. Went to use the bathroom and was completely disgusted by the rusty grate and dirty floor. Nothing has been done to upgrade the bathrooms much less clean them (see pictures). The shame of it all is that the food is phenomenal!! The sliders were like eating filet. Tried to save some to take home...didn&#39;t happen. The fish tacos were to die for. Perfectly fried fish, lightly seasoned...just the right amount of heat with the sauce. Trio of fries was amazing! Would have been great to have a few dipping sauces for them, but would definitely order them again, if we could bring ourselves to step into Platform 18 another time. It&#39;s a disgrace that such scrumptious food is bring served by unhappy staff in an uncleanly place."

Every time I&#39;ve gone here (both on weekdays and weekends) it&#39;s been pretty busy, but never more than a 10 minute wait. 

The menu is pretty much pancakes and waffles, but it has all the other basics and some specialties here and there. 

I ordered the blue crab meat Benedict with a side of chocolate chippies. The Benedict was okay, but it was worth trying just once. I was a bit let down knowing that it didn&#39;t come with any other sides besides pancakes, especially for how much it was priced at, but oh well. I loved the chocolate chippies! 

My family ordered ham and eggs and corned beef hash and eggs. Portions were pretty small for the prices. 

In summary, this place is decent. The price and portion ratio was a let down. Definitely is more for the pancake and waffle lovers, but if you&#39;re more of an omelette or savory breakfast person, I&#39;d go somewhere else."

I&#39;ve also been a customer for years but this visit was a disappointment. 
One, they are skimping on ingredients, for instance there was virtually no chicken in the chicken chipotle crepes, two tiny bits, and the cherry kijafa crepes are no longer made with the same delicious filling but rather with something that tastes like canned pie filling. The food is still good but these changes are a bad sign and are discouraging to long term customers.

There is a good reason why we&#39;ve been coming here for over 25 years-it&#39;s just excellent.  The breakfast here is top notch and you really get what you pay for. The decor is beautiful with the gorgeous woodwork, stained glass windows and chandeliers.

The food is the main attraction of course.  I&#39;ve never had a bad meal here; I feel like I&#39;ve had almost everything on the menu. My personal favorites are the Santa Fe Omelette, Dutch Baby with strawberry syrup/fresh fruit, the 49&#39;s, Swedish pancakes, corn beef with hash and the Crunchy French toast.  The coffee is soo good, hot and fresh, orange juice is fresh squeezed and hot chocolate for the kiddies is delicious and piled high with whipped cream!

The stained glass in the windows and the hanging lights over every table are pretty fascinating to look at. You feel like every seat&#39;s hanging light could be from a different grandparents house. I love the fact that they have &#34;The Great Treat&#34; on their menu. It&#39;s 3 pancakes, 1 sausage link, and a candy bar--for grandparents and grandchildren only.

Actually, that&#39;s why I came tonight. My grandpa used to make the most awesome buckwheat pancakes. I&#39;ve never found a place that has made it quite the same, but I figured I&#39;d give it a try. I mean let&#39;s be real they weren&#39;t horrible pancakes, but none will compare to those made with love. They were just okay...slightly bitter...but that&#39;s buckwheat! That said, $8.84 for for 6 medium pancakes and a water is a bit pricey!

I don&#39;t know if it was because I was by myself, but I was tucked in the back right in front of the dish tub where everyone&#39;s dirty plates where placed. It wasn&#39;t horrible, but annoying to keep hearing clanking every so often about 2 feet from my head.

My server was pleasant. The cakes came out pretty quickly too. I just wish I would have understood that I didn&#39;t pay at the table. I sat there for a bit looking like an idiot with my card on the receipt. Oh well, now I know.

I think I&#39;d go again, but I&#39;d try something else. There were some dishes that looked good as they passed by me and the server station..."

Maybe it was because I had just woken up and wasn&#39;t thinking straight, but when a friend asked me to go to Walker Brothers one Saturday morning, I agreed. I knew full well that there would be a gigantic line - the place actually has a waiting vestibule with permanently placed railings to keep those waiting corralled. We got there and parking was a total nightmare. I had to park across the street in a strip mall and then walk across like 6 lanes of busy traffic.

I entered the &#34;feeding line&#34; as I will refer to it and there were maybe twenty people in it, all in their weekend best - denim shorts, t-shirts with air brushed names of the dismal places they had vacationed three years previously. Suddenly I found that we were a quarter way down the line - the line was moving MUCH faster than I had anticipated. I would say we were in line maybe 10, certainly no more than 15 minutes. This surprised me, but I guess they have it down to a science.

The host led us through the beehive of activity that was the restaurant and seated us at a table. I ordered a cup of coffee....here is the thing, I don&#39;t drink a lot of coffee, but some years ago, I was really into it and was fairly familiar with some of the more exotic coffees and growing regions out there, so I do KNOW a good cup of coffee....Walkers coffee was surprising. It wasn&#39;t super strong, but it was excellent - and I mean, it was really, really good!!! I mentioned it to our waiter and asked what it was - being in the food industry myself, I wasn&#39;t surprised to hear that it was their own private label. 

I ordered the Santa fe omelet - it was big and looked as though it was baked in an oven. Typically when people do that, the outside browns and the texture turns to the texture of a shark&#39;s dorsal fin....this was neither burned, nor overcooked...it was likewise, very, very good. I ordered a short stack of pancakes instead of toast and...well, they were very good as well.

Excellent service, excellent - nay, amazing coffee - and the food was perfect. I honestly cannot find fault with this place apart from the fact that I don&#39;t like breakfast food. If the wait had been 40 minutes as I suspected it would be, I would have had a total meltdown - 4 year old temper tantrum right there in the foyer...but the line moved quick...I don&#39;t know...I want to find fault with this place for some reason, but I just can&#39;t.

First off the service is always great no matter which location. I&#39;ve been to the Arlington Heights one by myself before (was waiting for car to finish being looked at by Ford) and I felt so comfortable! Sometimes eating a meal alone at a nice sit down restaurant can be awkward, but they managed to make it feel natural. My most recent visit though was for my birthday breakfast with my husband! I ordered my favorite, Crispy-Crunchy French Toast. As soon as I saw it placed down in front of me I couldn&#39;t help but drool a little. They&#39;ve perfected the mix of crunchy outside with soft and sweet inside. The little slices of bananas and the dollop of whipped cream on top totally took the cake. I did my happy dance with almost every single bite. My husband ordered the potato pancakes, which is a staple I order from many different restaurants. Luckily enough I was able to have a little bite of his- it was my birthday, after all. Again with the crunchy outside and soft inside!!! Just the perfect &#34;fall apart in your mouth&#34; option. The pancakes were savory and buttery. You really didn&#39;t even need to top them with everything! It was the perfect start to my birthday, and it really would be the perfect start to any day!!! Make sure you try it, because you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

I chose this pancake house today. The outside of the restaurant has a nice appeal. I walked in and was seated right away. I immediately noticed how clean and bright the place is. The restaurant has a lot of charm, I loved all the different chandeliers. 
As soon as I sat down I was brought my silverware and water. The waitress came soon after. I ordered eggs benedict, I&#39;m on a benedict kick lately, and I opted for the pancakes instead of fruit. My food came right away and I must say, I was very impressed. The eggs were cooked just right, the sauce was on point and the english muffin was toasted and buttered perfectly. The pancakes were also delicious. I&#39;m embarrassed to say I ate almost everything. My drink was refilled constantly and I have nothing to complain about. Great job!"

It was more than enough food for the two of us, and we even had a pancake left over. Omelette was very satisfying, but the pancakes were definitely something different. It did not taste like the pancakes I&#39;ve had anywhere else. I feel like there was a bit saltier than a typical pancake, and it made such a huge difference! I wish I could go back to try their other pancakes like their famous german pancake and the apple-something pancake. Oh yeah, the waitress was also very nice!

We were there around 11:30 am on a Saturday, and we waited for maybe 20 minute in line, which was totally worth it. I&#39;m getting hungry just writing this review... Hope this review was helpful! :)"

The coffee mugs were stained with grime from previous users, the water glasses had flecks of dirt on them, and my spoon was not clean. We both looked past this and ordered our food. 

I ordered scrambled egg whites with ingredients including turkey sausage. My server put the turkey sausage on the side when I asked for it inside and charged me 4.25 for it. My boyfriends bacon was old and tough and the hash browns weren&#39;t hot :( We each got a basic entree and our bill came out to be $48! We could not believe it. The value does not match the price of the food, service, or cleanliness standards for the restaurant.  We probably won&#39;t be back!"

When I order this pancake I always get a german pancake as well so that I would be able to take leftovers home.  The apple pancake came and looked like it had been dropped or didn&#39;t rise completely because it was almost as flat as the plate it was on.  I commented to the waitress and she said she had never seen one that looked like mine before either.  The reason I order without apples is because I like the thickness of the pancake and like I said I NEVER had a problem before - EVER; and, I get this Apple Pancake quite often WITHOUT APPLES at the Arlington Heights restaurant too.  I asked our waitress if she would go to the Manager and ask if I could get another one as this is not how it usually looks and she agreed (I had never had to ask this either!)  Well she went to the Manager and asked if I could get another one and he/she said no because it would look the same as the one I got!?  What&#39;s up with this?  I NEVER had a problem before and now this Manager is saying I would have a problem because they don&#39;t come out right since there are no apples and this Manager didn&#39;t have the audacity to come and talk to me at our table!  What kind of customer service is this???  I am quite disappointed with this and will now order this pancake at a completely different restaurant - not a Walker Brothers!  I have been in the restaurant business via family and have worked as a hostess so I am not new to the business and how people should be treated... this is not how it should have been handled!  Shame on you and your management Walker Bros!"

No ambiance.  My husband has raved about it, so we met his family there.  We arrived at 8am to beat the rush and our party of 8 was immediately sat.  The omelette was good.  The eggs were light and fluffy.  We ordered the Denver omelette and substituted sausage for ham.  What was odd was that all the cheese was right in the center of the omelette only, but not folded like a French omelette.  Because of this, only 1/3 of the omelette bites had cheese.  We also got the apple cinnamon pancake.  It was light, fluffy, and eggy more like a German pancake opposed to an American.  All the cinnamon and apples were caramelized on the top.  We ate our omelette first and still the pancake was too hot to eat without blowing on it to cool down.  It was worth the wait though.  Really tasty, I would order this again."

Fortunately my friend got there earlier and I didn&#39;t have to wait forever, but he had to wait for me until I found the parking spot and the point is after driving around I couldn&#39;t make it and parked  all the way across the street and walked a little too.
I had eggs and bacons with rye toasted bread, well nothing special. He got Apple pancake with ice-cream. I had the bite. The pancake literally was HUGE not bad but too sweet for me.
 I have been honest to you and you can make an idea either go or not, but I am pretty sure I won&#39;t make any compromises for something Huge and too sweet!  
I am guessing that I am more lover of a  nice, calm and enjoyable than too crowded, popular and stressful for some point."

The young girls I ordered from were pleasant enough.  They still were uncomfortable to talk to.  I think my over-niceness personality threw them off and probably was put off by it. 

Food - I ordered eggs, ham, and toast.  My fiance ordered eggs, sausage, and pancakes.  The reaction our faces gave when we opened were, &#34;we should have gotten breakfast from another place&#34;.  We felt like we paid for overpriced McDonalds breakfast.  The portions were McDonald&#39;s portion, but higher in price.

Taste - I think our disappointment of the portion of the breakfast affected our taste buds.  I&#39;d hate to say it but I was just not happy with the amount of food we received.  Although, the ham was good, the over easy eggs were good, and the toast was good.  But it was just such small portions that I can&#39;t get it out of my head.  

Sorry guys but if you are going to charge what you charge for breakfast, then you should add some hash browns or home potatos, or something else.  It&#39;s just way too skimpy and you charge more than other places and their portions are bigger for less money and the taste of the breakfast is great as well.  Also, your pancakes were so small!!!  What was the size of the pancakes about?  I almost felt like I was being punished because of how small the pancakes were.

Anyway, thank you for the meal."

The apple pancake here is AMAZING. It is so good, it could be my last meal and I would die a happy woman. The delicious, eggy pancake is as big as the size of your plate and like two inches thick. It&#39;s topped with a hot caramelized apple topping consisting of sweet apples and delicious cinnamon and sugar. When the hot apple topping is poured on top of said pancake, it starts to crystalize creating a sweet, crispy, crunchy, sugary delight! It&#39;s like having the best apple pie in the world for breakfast. I think the pancake must have a bazillion calories, but it is probably the best breakfast I have ever eaten. It was so good I had to stop in not once, but two times on my recent visit to Chicago. The coffee is amazing as well, and pairs wonderfully with the pancake. I also had a side of bacon, which was good but nothing special. Obviously Walker Bros is a big hit in the suburbs of Chi Town because there was at least a 30 minute wait each time we went.

American cheese omelette, EXTRA cheese, &amp; an english muffin.  When my omelette arrived, it looked more like a small souffle&#39;. When I put the fork in the center, it flattened out to an empty/ hollow inside, with just a lining of egg &amp; a dot of cheese.  It looked not right, &amp; my friend commented too.  The English muffin....they keep getting smaller. This was the size of an oreo cookie.
Anyway......I should&#39;ve sent those nasty eggs back, but didn&#39;t want to fuss.
3 hours later, I had a very bad stomach ache w/ nausea.  Bad.  I had nothing else to eat.  Today, the stomach ache continues.  The culprit is that nasty looking &#34;omelette&#34;.  100% certain.

The monster omelets are both massive and delicious.  I was undecided between sweet or savory that morning, but when I saw that the omelets also come with pancakes, that sealed the deal!

I had the cheese omelet (cheddar and swiss) and opted to add sausage as well.  Walker Bros doesn&#39;t skimp on the ingredients, which made for a very filling and satisfying breakfast.  My pancakes on the side (served with whipped butter - yum!) were also very good.

The apple pancake is really good, but the sweetness may be too much for a meal.  Definitely ideal for sharing though.  

The service is attentive and courteous.  Our waitress was very friendly, and they kept our beverages full.  When we finished our meal, we couldn&#39;t help but notice an employee pacing back and forth while staring at our table.  I get it, it&#39;s Sunday morning, and you want to turn tables.  We didn&#39;t camp out for much more than 10 minutes before we paid our bill though.

I would definitely come back, as the food is definitely above average for breakfast, and the prices and wait were reasonable.  If you expect to linger and catch up with your dining partner, you may want to reconsider (or go when it isn&#39;t so busy)."

My boyfriend and I came here expecting great things based on the reviews and we left feeling &#34;meh&#34;. It was just ok. 

We didn&#39;t like that almost immediately after we were seated a man came rushing over with a pitcher of orange juice (we assumed was complimentary) that ended up tacking on another $10 to our bill. It was a bit deceiving.

The apple pancake was ok and the buttermilk pancakes had a weird taste to them. The bacon, however, was a nice thick cut and full of flavor. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d come back here, but I&#39;d definitely like to know where they get their bacon."

You&#39;re assured a good breakfast cooked to your liking and I haven&#39;t been disappointed. 
I did notice a change in their coffee and for the better, much richer and more aroma than in the past. 

I always get the WB combo which is the best of both worlds. I like having hashbrowns with the cheese and onions as well as eggs and pancakes and then you have a choice of bacon or sausage! 

The grandkids just love their pancakes there with crispy thick fried bacon. 

This month and every month there is a 25% off special and for October it&#39;s the apple pancake, one of their signature dishes!

Our server (whose name I have either forgotten or did not get) was pretty slow coming to the table for the first time.  Although she apologized, she also made a sideways comment about &#34;not being on her game today.&#34;  Which was totally true, because she continued to be pretty absent, and then make excuses for it.  Examples:
1) Busser brought juice.  She says &#39;oh, I was supposed to get that for you.  Oops.&#39;
2) Runners/other servers brought food.  &#39;Oh, I really wanted to deliver that to you myself.  Oops.&#39;

I understand that WB gets busy on the weekends, hire severs who can handle the capacity in a friendly, non-frazzled way.  Also, teach them tact.  We were sitting in the back in plain sight of the side station in the southeast corner of the restaurant.  One of the servers was standing back there, obviously complaining about one of (or many of) her tables while making snide facial expressions.  I watched her the rest of the time I was there, and she genuinely looked as though she hated her job.

The food wasn&#39;t exactly up to snuff either.  I mostly always order 49ers.  Did the recipe change?  They tasted syrupy.  I don&#39;t put syrup on my 49ers.

I do enjoy Walker Brothers as a special treat and a memory from my childhood.  I&#39;m hoping this was just a bad day."

The apple pancake is the legendary star of the joint, and something that always wows visitors, though I do recommend sharing one (with ice cream, of course) rather than dealing with the inevitable sugar coma that results from eating one all by yourself.

Just about everything else is top-notch - the omelets are big and fluffy, the bacon is big and just the right level of crispy, and all the different varieties of pancakes are excellent from the simple buttermilk to the blueberry pancakes that have both blueberries in the batter and a delicious blueberry compote served on the side.

The only thing to note is that the Sunday brunch rush is always a madhouse - expect to wait in line for up to an hour and then be rushed out the door by leering wait staff who want to turn your table ASAP, so if you&#39;re looking to catch-up with old friends on a Sunday this is not your place.

Usually it&#39;s super busy and the food is good (sometimes so-so, sometimes great) but service lacks and it is always pricey. But this time was the bomb.
Service was amazing- an almost empty restaurant certainly helped. We had a server and a trainee attending to us, and they were very detail-oriented. They even brought out a new glass of water with no ice for my dad when they came around to refill the rest of us with ice water.
The food was AMAZING. I had an apple pancake, which is a definite splurge for me. I usually resist because it&#39;s so big and for the past few years I&#39;ve felt the quality has gone down some. But the one they gave me was a 10. A+. 5 Stars. Ooey gooey, piping hot, crispy outside, soft inside. Delicious. The rest of the fam loved their meals as well.

If we&#39;re in the area on a Sunday, we&#39;re in line before 9:30am while church is still in session.   

Don&#39;t get discouraged when you get there and the line is wrapped around the building. Because most people gather to eat here in groups after church, there&#39;s an illusion that there is a long wait for a table. The line moves relatively quickly, because you have to wait until everyone is present in your party to be seated. We come in pairs and this gives us an advantage and often called out to jump the line. That&#39;s because couples are like men using the restroom. We&#39;re in, we&#39;re out. We&#39;re only slow because of our server or the cook. it&#39;s never us! 

I love their pancake batter and  it&#39;s a July special right now. Any other time, I order the  basted eggs with toast to soak up the yolk, corned beef hash and the best house blended coffee ever! I just want to say, their home made corned beef hash is oddly delicious. I can&#39;t pinpoint what makes it so unique but with the large side dish, it&#39;s easy to pass around and ask everyone at your table for their thoughts.

Special mention to the orange juice which was definitely freshly squeezed and very very tasty. 
I would love to come back to this place anytime but it&#39;s a bit expensive when compared.

I walked in and was seated right away. I immediately noticed how clean and bright the place is. The restaurant has a lot of charm, I loved all the different woods, windows and light fixtures . 
Taste - I ordered eggs  pancakes and Canadian bacon - I do not know what the Canadian bacon was  but I found it inedible  seemed rawish.  Had burnt smell coming from the kitchen area - the griddle ?  Not an appetizing smell. Good pancakes good syrup . good server - It did not live up to the Yelp reviews I had read."

I also loved the Dutch baby. Very thin like pancake with the option to get fresh bananas &amp; strawberries on top.
My favorite side &amp; must get are the spicy habanero &amp; cheese hash browns. It is very spicy so be aware but totally worth it!

One star is knocked down because I wish they had more juice options &amp; there&#39;s no alcoholic options (sometimes a mimosa is needed in the morning).

1st- I was hungry and looking for lunch. After pondering the menu, went with the large Italian sub and medium potato salad. The Italian sub was simply prepared, meat, veggies, and a tasty Italian dressing on a sesame seed Italian bread. All combined to a tasty sandwich, with the meat standing out in the end. I haven&#39;t had much luck with potato salad, this one was decent - all potatoes were cooked through, which usually is not the case at other places. Dressing on that was alright.

What I was really surprised was with my second order. Did not want to bother cooking dinner, and saw a side case of already prepared Italian dishes. I got the braciole and got a veggie rotolo. These came in microwaveable dishes. After reheating, we were pleasantly surprised that might. The marinara sauce was nice. The braciole was tender and did not require a knife to cut through the tasty layers. 

Would definitely come back again for a quick Italian fix."

That&#39;s the way I have mine, but they are more than willing to accommodate your sandwich to your likings. (No tomatoes for the wife). 

Other dishes my wife and I have enjoyed are the Joey sub, the roast beef sub, meatloaf, and grilled chicken panini.

Now, I&#39;m generally not much of a sub fan. I might even hate them. Something about them reminds me of grade school lunches where the cheese would sit on your sammie unrefrigerated for hours to the point where it goes a big rubbery one and gets all melty and disintegrated. Yucko the Clown. 

Mario&#39;s veggie sub has become my new Tuesday (or any time I&#39;m in the area) tradition. Get the 10 incher (trust me- if you go with the 6 your life will only be full of regrett), no mayo, and ask for the spicy cheese- that ish is seriously spicy and oh-so  GD delish. 

On occasion I&#39;ll veer from exclusively getting one 10 inch sub and opt for a little variety... like maybe I&#39;ll get two 10 inch subs, OR a 10 inch sub and ravioli, or a 10 inch veggie sub and the delish veggie rotolo... and I mustn&#39;t forget a kolacki cookie and gelato. Everything is phenomenal. Truly. And there&#39;s TONS of veggie options. 

On some days the super nice little woman behind the counter asks how many sets of silverware I need  for all the food I&#39;ve ordered... as if I&#39;m order for multiple people. Just one, I say. In fact, I probably don&#39;t even need the one bc everything is so good I just dig right in with my digits. Plasticware can&#39;t hold this Bia back, yo.

The environment inside is kinda sterile but it&#39;s a deli- whadya expect? And I&#39;ll admit that sometimes the worker bees can be kinda cold but I don&#39;t care- that veggie sub still manages to warm the cockles of my heart and I&#39;m giving them 5 stars for it.

Crisis averted. I was surprised to find a warm, cozy shop with a family feel once I walked through the doors. Turns out they&#39;ve been around for years, and you can satiate your craving for all things Italian between their impressive offering of just about any pasta dish your carb-lovin&#39; heart desires and their standout sandwiches. I went with the deceptively simple yet all-out awesome roasted red pepper and fresh mozzarella sandwich. If you&#39;re into salads and soup they make them too.

I like Mario&#39;s, but I don&#39;t love it... well at least not everything.

What I do love is that it is not Sub-Johns-nos.  I like real old fashioned sub sandwiches.  I also like that they have a variety of other dishes such as lasagna, chicken Vesuvio, meatloaf, eggplant parmesan, etc.
The food is all &#34;homemade&#34; tasting which puts it above all those chains.

Walking into Mario&#39;s from either the outside entrance, or the hallway shared with Bigby&#39;s you find yourself in a small, somewhat sterile environment with food cases on one side and plenty of tables and chairs on the other.  Everything is clean and well kept which is great for a restaurant.  It definitely has that deli feel to it that doesn&#39;t really encourage you to hang out.  I usually take my food over to Bigby&#39;s to enjoy it with a beer.

The counter is usually manned by Mario himself or his wife.  They efficiently understand what I am ordering and get the ball rolling.  The one area that I think leaves room for improvement is personality.  Perhaps they have been doing this for so long that it doesn&#39;t seem important anymore, but personality goes a long way.  All the times I have been in Mario&#39;s I have never felt that they appreciated my business.  I don&#39;t even care if they remember me personally, but just give some indication that you are happy to see me choose your restaurant.

Once you order, you get to hang out while they make the sandwich fresh (or heat up your entree which was precooked, but kept cold in the display case).  Speaking of the hot entrees, they are served in styrofoam bowls/plates and there is only plastic utensils.  I know that this is the way things are done these days, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have to like it.  I often avoid those items  if I think about it too much before ordering.  I also find the sauce to be good, but a little on the salty side.

Sometimes if the Bigby&#39;s/Mario&#39;s schedules overlap, I will get some dessert to go with my beer drinking.  (I&#39;m weird that way.)  Mario&#39;s has a nice selection of homemade desserts like cannoli, Napolean, tiramisu, cookies, brownies, and other things that I cannot remember.  Anything that has cream in it and benefits from being chilled is delicious.  Unfortunately, they keep the cookies and brownies in the same case and I didn&#39;t like that they were served cold.  They also have gelato (hidden off to the side by the napkins and utensils).  I have only had the hazelnut and vanilla.  The hazelnut gelato was very good.  The vanilla must not be as popular because it was a little freezer burned.

So overall I like Mario&#39;s.  I don&#39;t know if I would go out of my way to eat here if it wasn&#39;t next to Bigby&#39;s, but it is definitely a nice break from the limited Bigby&#39;s menu.  Unfortunately Mario&#39;s is usually a couple hours away from closing when Bigby&#39;s is opening up, so the window of opportunity is small.
Keep the fresh subs coming and I will be back... and looking for a little smile."

My favorite is the Italian sub--stuffed with meats, topped with lettuce and tomato and their Italian dressing, all on a nice hearty italian bread.  Delish. I&#39;ve had other sammies here and have never been disappointed.  The Ravioli is also a solid choice.  

Service is always friendly and prices are very reasonable.  There&#39;s a sweet station with gelato and pre-packaged Italian Ice.  And don&#39;t leave without checking out the pastry case--delectable delights!"

Yes, the meat was literally popping out of the sides of my Italian sandwich.  I was in sub heaven.  The sumptuous meat and cheese was complimented by a few pieces of lettuce and tomatoes and topped with Mario&#39;s Italian dressing on a very fresh sesame roll.  The only thing missing was a few thin slices of onion.  My wife ordered the veggie and a small cup of fruit salad and was quite happy.  Yes, vegetarians, between the veggie sandwich, eggplant paninni, and pasta dishes you have many options. 

The only thing that I won&#39;t do next time is order the 10&#34; sub.  I guess I&#39;m just not man enough!  This was the first time in a long while that I haven&#39;t been able to finish a sub.

Next stop at Marios will require ordering one of their beautiful looking pasta dishes.  I think I&#39;ll plan an evening visit to Marios for dinner and wash it down with a couple of Two Brothers pints from my favorite bar next door, Bigby&#39;s.  Yeah, that&#39;s the ticket..."

The owners are quite nice and were a great help on my last group order.  I ordered 4 different subs and they advised me what subs are the most popular and what is usually on them.  I got a hot corned beef and stayed away from the vegetables while the turkey got a touch of mayo along with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  The Italian has hot capacolla, genoa salami, mortadella, provolone, along with some veggies.  They use fresh Turano bread so it&#39;s got a nice &#34;chew&#34; along with some sesame seeds.  The bread has to be thick because they&#39;re so well filled.

They have a daily hot pasta menu item and for $7 or $8, it&#39;s definitely filling.  There are plenty of semi prepared items in their display case which can be heated up and added with sauce or perfect for a take home dinner to add to your own salad or sides.  The seating area is simple and clean.  There&#39;s parking in the back and it&#39;s not that difficult to get out onto Lake Street.  They close at 7PM on weekdays so it may not be the easiest place to get to on a busy weeknight but it&#39;s definitely a solid place for a meal when you&#39;re in the area."

They are really nice people and make some very, very good food that you can have brought over to Bigbys.  A little expensive, but the portions are always big and the quality is first rate."

Everything is delicious. Even though I&#39;m hooked on the sub sandwiches I stop in frequently to pick up quick dinners for my boyfriend and I. They are super friendly and know what they&#39;re doing when it comes to cooking!

My Italian sub had plenty of meat, tasty cheese and just enough dressing; the bread was chewy and perfect. My husband&#39;s panini looked delicious, but I wouldn&#39;t know since he scarfed it down so fast! I do wonder if I could get some giardiniera next time, that would be the perfect final touch to my sub... Anyway, the perfect end to our meal was the triple-chocolate brownies we took home for later: super-fudgy, with a light, creamy white chocolate layer on top. Drool.

The space itself is clean (although a few tables could&#39;ve used a wipe off) with maybe a dozen tables. There were cool pictures of various forms of pasta all over the wall, and some maps of Italy and its regions.

There was also a freezer case with sorbetto and other frozen delights.

We inspected the various pasta delights while standing in line, and let me tell you, I&#39;m looking forward to going back and trying the spinach gnocchi."

I&#39;ve had Mario&#39;s subs many times before, never actually been there or bought them until recently. I stopped in, two subs, two sides and $20 dollars later I was out the door. I ordered an Italian sub and got a small side of their macaroni salad which was delish. Boss man got a turkey salad and a side of pasta salad, aww but they gave us potato salad :( waah waaah. Over all the place is good but $10 per person? Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be a frequent shopper."

Their subs and paninis are amazing, along with their pastas.  I like that their sauce is not sweet like most other Italian restaurants.  It tastes authentic and like a tomato sauce should taste like.  We have been going here for 15 years.  We go here to treat ourselves:)  Go here once and you will see why.."

I am a rather sub snob, so they are not the best I have ever had.   The meat on the sandwich was nothing out of the ordinary.   Italian dressing and not mayo is always a good sign you know what you are doing.   Couple other Italian delis nearby that are at least as good if not better.

Mario&#39;s did have some interesting home made desserts on display.   I did not try one, but the cannoli looked really good.   Worth stopping in and grabbing a bite.   Would not drive out of the way to get one though."

I have been here a few times and I just love the food.  One time I got the grilled chicken sandwich sub and the chicken was juicy, most places make it dry as heck.

If you grew up in Addison with bunch of Italians, you know this is the real deal.  Their subs are great for lunch, but their meat balls and the sauce are the real deal.  I love going there, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Just  fantastic."

I LOVE pasta and Mario&#39;s has every kind of pasta you can imagine as well as italian meatloaf, rotollo, eggplant parmigiana, subs, soup, catering, and chocolate covered cannoli. Every meal usually ranges around $7 or so but man is it worth it. It&#39;s fast and they have more things than you will ever be able to try. Great for casual lunch! Right next door to Bigby&#39;s Pour House which is also amazing. I think I will be moving in."

The best!!!!  So delicious &amp; freshly made to order.   And they actually put meat in it!  It&#39;s not all bread w/nothing in the center.   I don&#39;t know how people eat that Subway garbage.  Disgusting.  I wish Mario&#39;s would open up a place in the Northwest burbs....I&#39;d be there all the time.  And I&#39;m going to order one right now &amp; go get it after work.

All of their other subs are really great, too. They put the perfect combination of veggies and condiments and make it with a lot of care -- it&#39;s not just thrown together like a lot of other places do. I have tried many of their homemade soups, and my favorite is the cream of asparagus. They also offer hot plates which I have not tried yet, but they&#39;re homemade daily and look very good. We frequent this place when we&#39;re in the mood for a good sub."

They make large batches of italian food to be bought in bulk or single servings.  My coworkers and I have stopped in there for their deli sandwiches and they&#39;re the shiznit.  It&#39;s like a good Turano bread that&#39;s not too dry and tough to chew through, yet not spartan like Jimmy John&#39;s bread.  Most of the time, the sub is about the bread, however with them having deli meat as well, the meat is outstandingly fresh and excellent."

Our office made regular runs to Mario&#39;s and never had a single complaint.  The have the BEST sub sandwiches around, period!  They also have daily hot specials. Our favorite was the Lasagna, oh boy! My mouth is watering just remembering it. You will see &#39;Mario&#39; there almost all the time.  They have catering available and a banquet/meeting room available in their modern facility.  You should have seen the old place --- half deli, half catering and half convenience store featuring Italian goods.  The place was popular that often people occupied all the open spaces waiting for their turn.  The new place is spacious and has tables if you want to sit and eat your food there.  Mario&#39;s is worth the travel if you are not fortunate enough to live near by."
