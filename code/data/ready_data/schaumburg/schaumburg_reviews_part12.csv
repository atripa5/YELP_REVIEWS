Two Yelp events and a successful solo visit put me in good position to give these guys a go-round.  Ever since this Wood Dale location first hosted an event for us Chicago &#39;Burbs Elitefolk, I&#39;ve always liked their unique approach to the sport.

TopGolf is basically a driving range that combines the radial scoring concept of darts with &#39;frames&#39; like bowling.  There are balls worth 2X points, bonus balls that get you a special award for a hole-in-one (but what&#39;s the prize??) and a system that works 95% of the time.  But it isn&#39;t foolproof, as occasionally I&#39;d smack a gorgeous shot that would hit the 150ft netting on the fly.....and got zilch.

Each range ball is coded with a tiny microchip that sends a signal from wherever it lands, which then gets displayed on a your golfing bay&#39;s HMI (that&#39;s &#34;human machine interface&#34; for all you non-engineers out there).  Each ball is logged according to your name on a swipe card, so you could theoretically alternate single shots and it&#39;d still track who was shooting.

If this all sounds very confusing, it is.  But it works surprisingly well, and TopGolf employees are more than happy to help first timers.  Everyone from the servers to the hostess/ma√Ætre-d to the range supervisors were friendly and umm....well....nice to look at.  Like literally every person I saw working here was easy on the eyes, and the clientele weren&#39;t too shabby, either.  Classy place, classy customer base I suppose.

Pretty people are all well and good, but how&#39;s their food?  Top.  Notch.  Knowing that I&#39;d be golfing here around dinner time, I put in an order for pretzel bites and mac&#39;n&#39;cheese eggrolls.  The former were warm salty nuggets that came with spicy mustard &amp; beer cheese, while the latter was a unique take that kinda worked.  Not sure if I&#39;m sold yet, though.

My buddy Jason K ordered tater tots, and when they brought out fries instead, we got to keep both.  Hooray!  A bucket of beer (6 pints) arrived ice cold and amounted to something like $5/pint, reasonable.

On a separate occasion, I saw someone order TopGolf&#39;s legendary &#34;mushi&#34;, which is short for Mexican sushi and is fantastic in both design and execution.  Instead of seaweed (nori) and raw salmon with cucumber, &#34;mushi&#34; is rolled in a tortilla and stuffed with smoked chicken and beans.  In place of wasabi and ginger are sriracha and sour cream.  BRILLIANT!

It goes without saying that TopGolf&#39;s kitchen is really......on the ball......

Bread = 4.5
Circuses = 4.5

I&#39;d come back in a heartbeat.  I mean I practically have to experience the &#34;mushi&#34; for myself and because I&#39;ve still got lots o&#39; credits on my player&#39;s card (which is needed to play here).  Great food, hella cute golfer babes, and a scoring platform that makes it easy for players of all skill levels to compete, or at the very least, just have fun.

Will highly recommend to friends, coworkers, and family members.  It&#39;s been close to impossible to find a venue that&#39;s the perfect amount of boozing + eating + activity for a certain Eric S&#39;s mid-winter birthday party.  Thanks to TopGolf, that quest is now over.

See you guys in January."

Some folks had a challenge with the computer software but the staff was helpful.
Had to order a separate meal from the group outing due to dietary restrictions.  Took away a star as they included a 20% tip.  Burger was made as requested.  Condiments didn&#39;t arrive until most of the meal consumed.  Cilantro spiced fries?  Not a &#34;usual&#34; type flavoring for fries.  Should have mentioned it when taking the order.  Horrid! Starbucks coffee was WAY too strong and bitter.  
I&#39;ll pass next time."

The place is open fairly late on weekends and is a nice alternative to weekend nights out. Definitely would recommend. Staff is friendly and the prices per game are reasonable.

A list of things that you can throw out the window. As a complete novice that has only played miniature golf twice. I was a little hesitant about coming here.

Arrived @ 8pm and It wasn&#39;t crowded (in march) so was able to break during the game and enjoy the the heated bay with conversation. Bay&#39;s are isolated enough where you&#39;re not on top of each other, Although I started drink orders at the bar, my group and I ordered food and more drinks in the bay area.

I wasn&#39;t hitting anything out the park but overall enjoyed the time hear. Would come back here again. As the games are affordable and food is decent. 

Brisket Grilled Cheese - simple toasted cheese sandwich with beef  - would order it again
Bacon Mac &#34;N Cheese Spring Rolls - green chill mac and cheese wrapped like an egg roll....Stayed in the fryer to long. Outside was too crunchy. Inside was hot. But flavor wasn&#39;t the strongest as I was expecting for it to be spicy but this was more 1 alarm spice. 

 
Two things I didn&#39;t like...

As a person that has never picked up a golf club besides a putter for miniature golf. It would have been nice to have a visual to explain golf clubs or the person that handed me the free rentals to offer an explanation of the clubs after I had mention I&#39;ve never played.

Place closes @ 11pm (during winter)  and bay heat was turned off @ 10pm. (well my date did move closer so I can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t &#34;like&#34; this part but...)"

Yes, it&#39;s cool that they come serve you food, and the food is pretty decent. I liked the flatbread that we ordered! Also, they have a decent selection of drinks. I was happy to get me some Goose Island on a Friday night :-)

The bays are &#34;heated&#34; but if it&#39;s cold, it&#39;s cold. It&#39;s not like you don&#39;t need a jacket.

The game is fun, and it&#39;s fun that it&#39;s computerized so that you know how many yards you hit to your target. 

Overall though, I think I&#39;d rather go to a traditional golf dome for winter time golfing because: 1.) Most important, you can crack a driver if it gets too cold. I wouldn&#39;t want to risk that if it&#39;s super cold out at top golf. 2.) Expensive. I could drive 2-3 times the number of balls for the same price. 

If you want to feel &#34;cooler&#34; and have good hot food however, TopGolf might be your choice. If you&#39;re mostly focused on golf, I would go to a dome."

The crowd was amazing, and everything was pretty clean and in good condition. The lane service, however, was awful. After finishing our games, literally had to wait 30 minutes (by the kitchen!) to get my receipt to pay and leave. The waitresses are definitely pretty but really should be more competent."

We had a private room and the food and service were both excellent. No complaints. We did have a few issues with the electronic scoring system for the driving range. One of the players kept getting error messages stating that his ball was unregistered, even though he was careful to put the ball through the machine each time (and we watched him do it). Don&#39;t know what was up with that. But otherwise, a great experience. Recommended."

It&#39;s such a fun easy going activity to do with your friends while hanging out, drinking some beers and having some snacks. This place does get quite packed, so I would recommend coming early! They also have a third floor, however it&#39;s open and it can get quite hot during the summer, so its not as enjoyable when seated up there. 

The food is quite decent here...the nachos and hummus are good. I got a walnut and goat cheese salad this last time; it was a huge portion and the cinnamon covered goat cheese was a great touch! The hummus was alright, and the same goes for the grilled cheese. 

It&#39;s a great summertime hang out and would definitely recommend going once while the weather is nice :)"

However, I have yet to actually par-take in the golfing part itself (go figure). This review is strictly about my lunch experience at Top Golf, but you best believe I plan to go back soon and get my game on.

My sister and I popped in around 12:30 on a Tuesday to check out the venue and catch up over lunch. I was surprised by how many people were playing golf at that time of the day! The upstairs bar area where we were sitting of course was pretty dead with maybe two other tables in there, but still a decent size groups for the middle of the day in my opinion.

We were able to choose our own seats so we grabbed a high top table near the window. Our server&#39;s name was Jackie and he was great. Super friendly and very on top of everything. Actually, every person at Top Golf I&#39;ve met and talked to have been awesome. Really professional and genuinely seem to enjoy their job, which is always nice to see.

I started my meal with a skinny white margarita. $8 and only 160 calories! It was super refreshing and delicious. Not too sweet.

We of course then had to start with an order or their mushi (Mexican sushi). I have heard (or read on Yelp rather) all about it and it&#39;s a Top Golf exclusive dish. These delectible little rolls consist of cilantro sticky rice, drunken beans, spiced chicken and Cheddar cheese neatly rolled in a jalape√±o tortilla. Oh and beautifully garnished with sour cream, avocado and sriracha hot sauce of course. A-MAZE-ING. Be sure to order this!

I honestly wasn&#39;t super hungry after splitting the app, but when in Rome am I right? I proceeded to order the Top Golf Club - artisan bread stacked high with oven-roasted turkey,pecanwood smoked bacon, tomato, red onion, red leaf lettuce, cheddar and dijon aioli. Now they&#39;re not kidding when they say stacked high. I mean this baby was piled on my plate. Needless to say I only ate half and took the other half home. 

Their sandwiches (or stacks as they call them) are served with  your choice of French fries or tater tots, or you can substitute sweet potato fries or a side salad for $1. I went with the sweet potato fries and also thought the $1 up charge was not bad at all compared to most places. While the flavors of the fries were on point, the consistency was not my fave. They were a little too soggy for my liking.

Overall - great lunch experience! The concept of Top Golf itself is really awesome, and the fact that they have a really tasty (and large) menu of food and drinks makes it that much better. 

Looking forward to coming back to play some golf!"

I was going to a Yelp event but wanted to get there early for a drink, appetizer, and just check it out. The guys at the front door welcomed us and explained where we could grab a beer and something to eat. 

We walked into the restaurant/ bar area and found a table. I was surprised at how crowded it was. We waited for awhile before a server came to us. This is acceptable because of the open seating and crowd. 

We ordered beer and shared the Mushi appetizer. The Mushi was AWESOME!!! I&#39;m glad the server suggested it because I was going to order something else. The food was fresh and brought to the table quickly. 

Our server (Drew) kept our beers filled and was nearby if we needed anything. He told us a little about Top Golf and explained that a new location will be opening in Naperville! Woohoo!! I had a great experience even though it was short. I will be back to eat, drink, a AND golf soon!"

However, the chilly Chicago wind, weather &amp; rain put an end to that.  So we were graciously moved inside to the driving range.  Honestly, I think this gave me a better impression of TopGolf.  I know I can putt putt.  I had forgotten I have a pretty decent drive.

After sampling some beer &amp; appetizers, I thought I had enough of a buzz to try to hit some balls with the only guy at our table who seemed interested in playing.  Since I had not played golf at all since college, I expected to be terrible.  I guess it&#39;s like riding a bike.  There wasn&#39;t much accuracy to my drive, but man did that ball fly.  It was fun to see how far I could hit it.  With a bit of luck, I even scored 2 bullseyes.  

And lucky for me, there&#39;s a TopGolf within 10 minutes of my house in Austin.  I have always wanted to try it, so now I know how much fun it is.  I hope that location is as good as the Wood Dale location.  TopGolf...top notch!"

The wait times can still be long on Fridays and weekend nights but the experience is fun and worth hanging out for a little bit. They do offer executive memberships which will cut down on wait times. When we were there last night, we ordered wings, nachos, tots, and calamari. All were good. Drinks were also swift and well poured. Our server took good care of us. I have changed my outlook on Top Golf and the new location in Naperville may have helped to drive down the craziness that used to be at the Wood Dale location. Fun place to hang out with friends, rain or shine, and hit some balls. You don&#39;t need clubs, they will rent them to you as well."

The scoring system with chips in the balls and sensors on the nets was a really cool system for casual competitive play between friends. They had regular and lefty clubs for use (turns out I&#39;m a lefty!) and with the help of a friendly fellow golfer, I learned how to swing enough to score a few fun shots. While I didn&#39;t order any food, others with me did and it looked pretty darn good. The heated bays were a nice touch and the waitstaff made sure everything was great all along.

This was my girlfriend and I&#39;s first experience at a Top Golf. We&#39;ve heard great things about the franchise so we finally planned a date night here. Let me first say, this place was even better than we thought, not just because of the concept but because of the customer service from the moment we got our golf clubs to the second we walked out. 

Our waitress, Jamie, was nothing short of awesome. She greeted us promptly and she had a great sense of humor/ton of patience when it came to the million questions we had about the game itself and the food. Per Jamie&#39;s recommendation we ordered the nachos with chicken. I think it was a few bucks more for the meat but it was well worth it. She made us feel at home, as if we were a top priority there. Plus! We were never without a drink or waiting around for her (which is big for me)..At one point, while bringing us another round, she overheard us talking about cinco de mayo plans for when my cousin is in town so she told us about the event they have going on. Honestly, I never would have thought to go here but I left feeling excited to get our friends on board with the idea.

Her passion for the business radiated off of her. It&#39;s so rare to come across service like that and I couldn&#39;t let it go to waste. She even stopped on her way to another table while we were getting up to leave to thank us for visiting. I believe in giving credit where credit is due and because of Jamie and the rest of the Top Golf team (&amp; the humor of watching my gf fail miserably at hitting a golfball) we will definitely be back!"

I really enjoy coming here.. definitely come in the morning. They open at 9am. They get busy on weekday evenings and on the weekends. I first tried this place out back in August when my team from around the world were visiting. I set up a day event at Top Golf working with Valerie and she was very easy to work with. She got us what we needed, the food set up, and cards to play. We received really good service, just a bit sad that we didn&#39;t get to pack the leftovers home.. we had so much leftovers. It was because of food sanitation and they don&#39;t allow us to take it home (even we paid for all of it) if it&#39;s sitting out for over an hour. Oh well. It was really fun playing Top Golf. There were 7 of us and we each played 4 rounds!

I brought my husband here few weeks after for his birthday and he enjoyed it. He likes driving the golf balls to specific targets and see the score automatically populate on the screen. It is good to practice your shots and aims. Definitely not a golf course and not real-life golf. We came back two weeks ago and we had fun as well. He will be going back tomorrow with his co-workers. I think he&#39;s trying to get as much time in at Top Golf before it gets cold. We love being on the 2nd floor..we should try 3rd floor one day. Definitely a good time every time we go!"

There are three floors to accommodate for a large number of people. I could compare this experience to going bowling with friends but more exciting because you don&#39;t actually have to know how to golf - just grip and swing! 

When we walked in, the lady in the front directed us to where you pay for your cards. Each player needs a card ($5 for the card itself or $20 for the card and $25 worth of credits in your card). Go on a weekend because games are $3 each, but on the weekdays they are $7 per game. After buying our cards, the front desk lady told us to go to any open spot and that a server would provide us with balls and clubs. We picked a bay on the third floor (which was perfect) and when we started, we were the only people on that floor. Even though the games were more expensive since it was a weekday, there was still a good amount of people there but it wasn&#39;t overly crowded. 

Service was nothing special. Nobody accommodated us from that point on. We clearly didn&#39;t have clubs or balls, but nobody came to help us and nobody came to tell us where to get things. We figured it out ourselves. If you don&#39;t have clubs, you can rent them for free from the front desk. The balls come from a ball machine on the second or first floor - you insert your card and put the basket under the ball dispenser. Nobody even taught us HOW TO PLAY. When we got to our spot, we looked at the little monitor located at each spot and learned how to play that way. Each hole is worth different points; landing in the green is worth 3 points and landing closer to the hole is worth more. 

The activity itself was fun and really different! They had music playing, which I really enjoyed. We ate right before we came so we didn&#39;t order any food but next time, I&#39;m definitely going to try something (I&#39;ve heard the food is amazing). I did look at the menu and everything was appealing; everything was super affordable. They do have drink specials on beer on Mondays and Tuesdays. 

If this is something you&#39;ve never done, I highly recommend that you try it. It&#39;s the perfect group outing, it&#39;s the perfect date for two, and it&#39;s a super fun family activity! IF WE HAD GOTTEN BETTER SERVICE OR HAD THE STAFF ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGED US, I would&#39;ve given this five stars!"

I had such a great experience that I want to come back even if I suck at golfing. We also had drinks and a little snack. We had some sort of drink that had pineapple in it and we were hoping it to be a bit stronger and not too fruity but it was still good. We also had donut holes that came with syringes.

It&#39;s not quite as high tech as some newer location - you have to feed the golf balls manually through a slot to register them into the scoring system before each stroke. Not the end of the world, but mildly frustrating when you forget and realize the last 5 balls you&#39;ve hit haven&#39;t been scored. Seeing as this is what separates Top Golf from a normal driving range, I wish this was more user friendly.

That said, the location is otherwise very nice. The servers helping our party were extremely attentive and the dinner buffet was delicious. Would definitely return (and try to remember to not mess up the scoring next time)."

I was thinking of booking the place for a team outing for work but I wanted to try it out first instead of spending a bunch of company money on a place I&#39;d never even tried.

Unfortunately, when I arrived with a few friends, I was told that there was a two and a half hour wait, and they suggested we wait at the bar in the meantime. Although we had intended to make a night of it, waiting around for two and a half hours is asking too much. We just turned around and went back to the car.

As much as I&#39;d like to try this place out, I can&#39;t imagine under what circumstances I would be okay waiting for such a long time. They do take reservations for groups of 12 or more but there is no way I would plan a group trip to a place I&#39;ve never been to. They should really come up with a way to accommodate smaller groups."

This one is so much better to me compared to the one in Naperville. But was not happy when we were billed for six buckets of beer between the two parties. The four of us drink a total of three buckets and the server separated our bills per our request but each bill had three buckets on it. We were not drunk enough to let that one slide.  Better luck next time

They really have outstanding customer service; it endears me to this place even though I live 45 minutes away. They run an excellent Facebook page, continually updated and lots of contests. On site the workers really seem to like their jobs and try to help. Not all are able to help, but you can tell they want to try so the customers are happy. If they can&#39;t help, they will quickly grab a supervisor. 
The golf games are fun. Not a place to really put in your genuine practice, but super fun for anything social. The food is good too. 

I&#39;m sticking with a five star review because I think everyone should go, but a couple warning tips: the Mushi isn&#39;t as good as it used to be. Try something else, most food is delicious. Also, the kids&#39; chicken fingers are fried in a batter that would be better for a fish fry. It&#39;s really crunchy and greasy, not so great for tiny mouths. Also, it&#39;s really expensive. Just know what you are getting into, cost wise, and turn it into a night out with friends or a family day so you don&#39;t worry too much about the money."

Well, not so little. There are many spots for you to try to play a game (similar to darts but with golf clubs). You gain points by hitting golf balls into the targets at the gold course. It was a clean and nice facility with heaters as well since it can get a bit chilly in this unpredictable Midwest weather.

The staff were very attentive! We ordered some food: signature nachos with chicken and the turkey avocado wrap with tater tots. Both were delicious. The signature nachos were delicious, with delicious chicken, guacamole and sour cream to cover each bite. The avocado wrap had a delicious chipotle aioli as well--and the tots were the best. It was fast service!

We ordered some appetizers and a round of drinks while  waiting for a lane to hit some balls- We were told it would be about a 2 and half hour wait so we figured no problem what a great place to watch the game as we wait for our lane and eat some pretty good food. 

 The Hawks won and we ended up getting our lane after about an hour and half which was an hour earlier of what we were initially told so totally cool! We purchased a bucket of balls to hit in the range and ordered a round outside and started hitting some balls. After about 10 mins we saw 2 security guards talking into their earpiece and staring at us , they walked by our table about 3 times without saying a word . I mentioned it to my girlfriend and thought it was odd, she said maybe something was going on in the place. FInally they told us we were cut off abruptly in a completely cold unprofessional manner. I asked for an explanation,  they told me the waitress told them to let us know and they had no clue why as they even mentioned they weren&#39;t sure why they were asked to cut us off as they were monitoring us.  I asked to speak to a manager for an explanation, a manager came over and also could not provide an explanation so he called his waitress over and she said she received a complaint that we were being &#34;Loud&#34; from 2 lanes over , the lane next to us was a bunch of college kids also being &#34;Loud&#34; but somehow we were the ones that were told we were cut off. 

I asked the waitress and the manager if they ever used their own discretion in making a decision to send 2 security guards to cut people off, I also suggested in the future to &#34;talk&#34; to people and maybe use some discretion in assessment of cutting people off and denying our business.  The manager gave us his business card and apologized after I explained to him how to handle a situation.  I could tell he was poorly coached and obviously the staff there needs adequate training . I will never return my business to top golf again. 

For any top level management reviewing this post , feel free to check the video camera that was right above our lane (25) on Saturday 4/23 approximately 9:40 pm - 10:30 to review the whole incident or feel free to email me at dinograno@hotmail.com."

Lots of problems; flags were missing from two locations, one of the target locations that was a part of each game we played was out of order they said was from the snow we received a month ago, the station we were at did not work, so after already hitting a couple balls and nothing happening, we had to move to another station,  it rained while we played and our new station was the only one that filled up with huge puddles of water right behind the tee box so we had to move again, and one of the ball feeders was out of order so there was only one station for everyone around us to get their balls which feed very slowly...one ball every few seconds.

If it was just the condition of the location, I would have given 1 star for my first experience there!!!  But the staff is very very nice and helpful, the cashier was happy and fun, the wait staff was very nice and helpful as well, and they all know how to use the kiosks.  The golf games are fun to play.  We played about 6 or 7 games.

Aside from that, we ordered a couple burgers...their burger with mac and cheese had to be one of the best tasting burgers I have had in a long while...asked for medium got medium!!!  The staff there helped move us both times we had to move due to the above issues and gave us each 2 free games for the first problem with the kiosk...I look forward to going back again soon for both the sport and the meal!!!"

Exhibit A -- the MUSIC.  I went on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving w/ a friend, both of us looking to work on our golf game.  We got there at noon, and there were maybe 3 or 4 small groups there at the time.

The music there was pretty much BLASTING, and they have individual speakers in EVERY hitting bay.  If you&#39;re trying to work on your game, it doesn&#39;t exactly help to have a big speaker 10 feet from your head, blasting One Direction.  We even asked if they could turn it down, but they said that&#39;s the volume people like.  

It also seemed like the sensors didn&#39;t always catch golf shots.  Most of the time, yes, but there were shots that we swore went directly into the nets, but it didn&#39;t register a score.  Not a huge deal, but might be time to do an overhaul/repair on some of the sensor systems.

ALL THAT SAID, we did stay there for 4 hours, and had a fun time.  The food is very good, the service was excellent, and it is better than just a standard driving range.  You can work on your accuracy there.

I would recommend going earlier in the day; before 1:00 on weekends or 3:00 on weekdays and doing the unlimited games package otherwise it could get a little pricey to pay for individual games later in the day.  We ordered a couple flatbread pizzas which were yummy and had drinks and the service was good.

The place is larger than I envisioned. I think the mini golf course section could have been scratched off. Also, not sure if I like the whole game card concept to allure customers to come back, charge more and forget how much you&#39;re actually spending.

I also took my first set of golf lessons with Matt at this location, and he&#39;s awesome. He&#39;s got an approachable teaching style and great tips. He&#39;s also patient, which is perfect for beginners like me who are nervous about making fools of themselves. In the span of about six lessons, I&#39;ve gone from a newbie to someone with a discernible swing. When I miss, I understand why and when I hit well it&#39;s usually a great shot.

As my friend described it, it&#39;s like a bowling alley but for golf. Instead of a regular hit-it-as-far-as-you-can driving range, there are targets where you can score points.  And while you are working towards becoming the next Tiger Woods, you can enjoy a brew or two and merriment with friends. They have a full bar but a waitstaff will come to your bay to take your order. I HIGHLY recommend their tater tots.  I ordered it for my group but ended up eating it all by myself before the guys could get to them.  Their guacamole was also pretty awesome.  You can taste the freshness.

Since I had not planned on going golfing during my trip, I didn&#39;t bring my clubs. I was able to rent one. The clubs were... aight.  They are comparable to a beginner set that you would get at Big 5 or Target.  I recommend bringing your own if you are really practicing and have some measurable goals.

I also enjoyed the array of tasty brews available! I fully expected a typical selection of plain Miller or Bud but there were some delicious microbrews available (8-bit, Daisy Cutter, etc). 

My only issue is how confusingly expensive this place is. Good luck easily understanding the pricing structure and what you should or shouldn&#39;t do. And if you want to buy more games you can&#39;t do it from your booth or with your server...you have to go back down to the main area and recharge your card.

Of course they offer discounts for golfing at non-peak times--if you have jr golfers be sure to sign up online--because you will receive discounts and specials--which are always nice---but a trip here after a few bucket o balls, drinks, and noshes--well you guessed it-- a little more than I wanted to spend.

We opted for first available, so only took about 10 mins for us to wait.  I was happy that we were seated in a non-smoking area. The table service was nice---I didn&#39;t have to go to a separate area to get food and drinks.  They have a number of different games on their computerized system--so depending on your skill level could pick something really easy or super challenging.  The day we were there they had a dj and a bunch of different drink specials.  The bay that we were in had a couch and a couple chairs so ample space to chill out.

Hooray for bucket o balls!"

Pros: It&#39;s open year-round, you can borrow clubs, good food, drink specials, different games to play, fun for the whole family

Cons: Slightly overpriced, HOURS to wait on weekends (unless you have a VIP membership which costs even more money), the ball machines have been on the fritz the past few times I&#39;ve been there, HOURS to wait (I know I&#39;ve listed that twice because it&#39;s twice as bad)

No matter how you slice it (pun intended) there is no place like Top Golf so it takes the cake and it definitely is a good time!"

I knew going in that it would be more about the experience than it would be the golf, even still, my review is pretty golf-centric because after all, this is a driving range &#34;experience.&#34; I will say that the check-in process was very easy and the girl behind the counter was super helpful when explaining the different options. The computer in my booth had an internet explorer error and it crashed. I thought it was amusing...internet explorer? Really? Anyways, once we got the computer up and running, the 6 of us ordered some food and started looking into the games. We started with TopGolf since it seemed the simplest, and it was quickly apparent that distance rewarded no bonus, so everyone put their long clubs away and started whittling away with their PW. I didn&#39;t see anywhere a diagram of how far the flags were so we pretty much just took turns being first so the rest of us would know what club to hit. After that, we got a bit bored and started trying to hit the 185 flag, but that was about as far as the range went, and if everyone couldn&#39;t agree on hitting longer clubs, then back to the drawing board we went with our PWs. We asked an employee if the &#34;TopPractice&#34; mode showed distances and they said yes so we decided to do away with target practice and simply tried to get competitive with each of our clubs&#39; distances, BUT, distances weren&#39;t recorded unless you hit the targets. What is the point of that? That is just TopGolf with no points on the screen. Since we couldn&#39;t back out of the game, we just kept score by hand. Now, if you&#39;re reading reviews about this place and checking their site, you&#39;ll know going in that the food and drinks are expensive, but not if you consider the whole ambiance of this place. Its just as much about a sports bar environment as it is a driving range, and so, the prices reflect that. We had calamari, burgers, sliders and some cold beers - it was all just fine, no complaints. I&#39;d eat it again if I came back. My biggest critique of this place is that I think it caters really well to a league type atmosphere, and a very casual clientele, but not that middle group very well. My friends and I play to between 8 and 18 handicaps, and we got bored pretty quick with simply doing target practice. If you come with a group of people who hardly play golf and you&#39;re all using TopGolf equipment, you&#39;re going to have a blast, and if you&#39;re here in a league with prizes on the line, you&#39;re going to have a blast, but if you&#39;re here with some casual golfer friends trying to hone your skills, you&#39;re going to leave a little disappointed and with a much lighter wallet than when you came. Overall, it is a nice place, I just think I&#39;ll pick and choose when to come and when to hit the range."

They have a nice menu, much better than what I expected. The food was good, but their service was absolutely horrible. It was a disappointing experience. We should have gone to the buffet."

This before the way over priced booze and food. 

This before you had to wait three to four hours to get a bay. 

This is before the seediness started with people paying the front host to get a bay faster. 

The pros of this place are that there is nothing like this in the area and it&#39;s really an awesome, fun concept. Makes golfing accessible to anyone and everyone. 

The cons are that this place is waaaaay over priced and literally on any given day you will have to wait 2-4 hours to get a bay on which to play!!! 

That is flat out unacceptable. Hopefully with another location opening up it will ease the customer load on this location. 

If you do go make sure you bring your wallet to both pay your deep tab and the front host to get a bay. I&#39;ve seen it happen. I&#39;ve been jumped numerous times after waiting for 2+ hours."

Driving range with heated lamps and servers coming and taking orders is pretty sweet. They also have a decent seating area if u want to get a meal after or before the golf.

That being said - it&#39;s a neat place. It&#39;s the perfect excuse for golfers to practice their swing while having fun with those that don&#39;t know how. The food is pretty good, the service was great, and for sunny summer day, it&#39;s lovely!"

There were ten of us and we had two bays. The organization and setup was very good by the personnel. Our server Nicole was attentive, friendly and did a good job. The concept is fun...the balls have microchips in them to register where they go and how many points your drive gets.  The high scorer after playing 20 balls wins. This place is very busy and in order to get two bays next to each other and reserve a time, I had to plan a very expensive birthday party, $600+. Alcohol was not included and we spent another $100 on top of the $600 which isn&#39;t a bad alcohol bill because we had 10 people and not a lot drinking because of the time of day.  The appetizers I chose off the menu were delicious!  The flatbread and nachos were the best part of the food served. They were served outside where we golfed.  Since it was very hot, they set up the buffet in the air conditioning for us which was very nice. Unfortunately, the lunch buffet was sub-par. I chose the Southern Selection from the party choices, consisting of fried chicken sliders, cubed bbq brisket sliders, cole slaw and assorted chips.  The fried chicken sliders were thin pieces of dried out chicken that were tasteless. Never get these!  They were hard to stomach.  The coleslaw was tasteless, no favor.  The bbq beef brisket was better, thankfully. I was so embarrassed that this is what my guests had to eat. I spent so much money and was very unhappy with the quality of the food on the buffet. I think if I come back just with my husband or a couple people, the menu food would be quite good if the appetizers are an indicator.  I don&#39;t understand how the difference could be that way off.  I certainly didn&#39;t feel like I got my money&#39;s worth today. Not only was the food sub-par on the buffet, but we didn&#39;t even get two games in!  If people are spending that kind of money for a party, Top Golf should give them two full games to play even if it runs over the two hours. Ridiculous. I brought sweets for my dad&#39;s birthday and they were kind enough to cut the cake and serve, but we sat there for a long time without water or anything to drink.  Nicole was busy figuring out the bill, so I flagged down another staff member who eventually brought the water.  I will never plan another party at Top Golf. Too expensive for mediocre food. I will come back for a fun time and order off the menu. As I said, the flatbread and nachos off the menu were delicious. I just wish the lunch buffet was that good...and that we actually could play two full games.  I felt robbed today for sure!  Giving a star for the fun concept of the golf game, a star for the appetizers and a star for staff setting up the buffet indoors and cutting the cake. Two stars were taken any for the &#34;meh&#34; buffet and not being able to play two full games."

All and all it&#39;s a pretty cool place - great atmosphere/trendy space, good food and drinks. 

Only a few things to complain about from this particular experience: 

1: The check in process to get your game card is really long for some reason. Only 3 people were ahead of us and we waited in line for 15+ minutes. 

2: It happened to be really busy overall when we went so the wait for a course pod thing was long - which is fine - but they seemed to be severely under staffed for how busy they were. Between waiting at our pod thing for our server then, when we didn&#39;t see him for awhile, actually walking up to the bar in an attempt to get our food/wine order in we waited a total of 25 minutes before someone just took our order. Then we waited another 15 mins, once the order was in, to get our actual drinks delivered to us. A bit annoying.. 

3: The damn ball machine spits out balls slower than.. well something that handles balls REALLY SLOW! Thank god my b/f and I only bought one game each, for a total of 40 balls, god knows how long it would take for 80, 100+ to come out! o.O (I get the obvious innuendo here but it&#39;s hard to word it any other way darn it! BALLZ :D ). 

Final Verdict

All and all I&#39;d recommend this place for any golf enthusiast in the burbs. Great for groups, good food, moderately priced, and overall a good time."

PROS: Great range to play games on. Love that it&#39;s interactive! I like that it saves my info for me from previous times I&#39;ve visited and I love that after I hit a ball, I can go look at the screen to see where I&#39;ve specifically landed it (unlike squinting into the distance). Really love that it&#39;s all year round, they have heaters and some bays have couches which make it really comfy with your friends. I love that they have table service here as well.

CONS: BE PREPARED TO WAIT! We went once on a Friday night and of course the weather was gorgeous but the wait was 4 hours!! We decided to stay with our friends because we really didn&#39;t have anything else to do. So we hung out in the bar and played giant Jenga and bags. Well we didn&#39;t get on a bay until 11:30pm which sucked but I guess we asked for it by going on a Friday night. The food here sucks and so does their prices!! I guess they must have changed their menu a bit recently because when we ordered the nachos (like $8-10) we looked over the fact that they&#39;re INDIVIDUAL nachos!! OMG were we upset when we got them! Seriously it was more than a dollar a nacho. It did however, say in the menu that they were individual. Seriously though? Anyways try to avoid getting food here, it&#39;s really not worth it at all. The mixed drinks aren&#39;t that special either, again avoid that. 

Otherwise it&#39;s a cool experience especially if you&#39;re there for the love of golf. Try to avoid making it something more, then I promise you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

==============================

I have been trying to get out here for so long, but the location was always a limiting factor because it&#39;s almost an hour from where I live in the city. However, I&#39;m so glad that I did because it was a TON of fun.

If it&#39;s your first time, there are many options for pricing that were a little overwhelming at first. Basically, if you&#39;re planning on coming back more than once, the adult playing card for $35 is for you that comes with $45 of credits (games priced at $3.50 or $7 based on day and time). Otherwise, you can pay for a guest playing card for $5 and pay per game on top of that. If you&#39;re a student, which I am, you can pay $20 for $25 of credits. Since I live so far and I&#39;m moving out of state soon, I figured this would be my only chance to play. I stayed for about 3 hours and got 7 games at 20 balls each for my $20 --- awesome deal! (Although I was super sore after hitting 140 balls).

There are options for games depending on your skill level, but we just stuck with the regular &#34;Top Golf&#34; game. Each game is 20 balls, and you get points both for distance and accuracy (proximity to the flag). We mixed it up a little by inventing our own game by aiming 5 for the red target, 5 for yellow, 5 for green, and 5 for white. My only small gripe was that there was no difference in hitting a ball accurately into a target slot, versus having a ball bounce and roll into the slot out of luck.

I wish I could go back! Please open a Top Golf in Boston soon and I will see you there!"

We received great service from the bar downstairs as we grabbed a drink and app  (mac n cheese egg rolls!) while waiting, and the check in staff were very patient since I was not as familiar with the process loading games to our cards. However, the stand out of our visit was our server Ashley. She was very attentive when we arrived at our bay, and even added a few games to our card when our computer malfunctioned and went blue a quarter of the way through our game. There was a shift change after we ordered our food (chicken &amp; waffle sliders!)  and while we were under the impression that the tips would be split between servers, that was not the case.

We randomly came in from Wisconsin for a bachelor party, we were greeted kindly as we walked in the door.  The front desk was very helpful.  We had a server named Sue.  She was conscientious, and made things fun before we even ordered are first drink.  She suggested the sunrise burger which four out of Six of ordered and the burgers were delicious.  We never were dry, never had to ask for anything and the humor  Sue brought to they bay everytime she came by was Hilarious.  We usually have doubts about Servers that are a little older, but  she rocked and if we take another trip to Top Golf we will definitely ask for Sue.

The golf balls are RFID tagged, so you can play &#34;games&#34; based on hitting the ball far or short, and into targeted areas like you would do when playing darts...except you are doing so with golf balls :-)

The mini burgers and tots were my favorite however the wings looked amazing until I bit into one and they were still bloody. So yeah, someone needs to learn to fry wings.

The concept is fairly simple, it&#39;s like a permanent driving range of 3 floors and the balls have a digital chip in them that can keep score and track to see if you have hit on target. It&#39;s golf meets technology, really cool and fun for beginners and advanced players alike!

I&#39;ve been here about 4 times now and even had a birthday party with friends on the roof top about 2 summers ago. It&#39;s really a great place to hang out all year round. In the summer is when they are probably at their busiest and the winter, they have outdoor heating so you can stay toasty while taking a few swing. Besides having a menu of bar food and drinks, they often have live bands on certain days and weekends and I believe there are many other activities and promotions if you check their sites. 

The prices here reasonable, not too cheap but not too much to create a dent either. You do need to sign up for a card to be able to start playing and you can add credits onto your card to get the balls for your games. They have clubs you can borrow or you can bring your own. No matter what game you choose, it&#39;s great for date night or an outing with a group. 

Just be aware that this place is quite popular on Friday nights and the weekends. Call ahead to ask for wait time before you head over. I&#39;ve called once on a Friday summer night and there already was a 2.5 hour waiting time for a bay, crazy!! Last weekend however, I went with some friends at around 11pm and there was no wait. The place closes at 2pm so if you&#39;re a night owl, you can definitely work this to your advantage and still have enough time for several games. Check it out! Highly recommended."

The chef at TopGolf however came from Lettuce, and the quality is excellent. I had a turkey wrap and tater tots that were superb.

The wait to even get a booth can be up to two hours. And forget about going on a Thurs-Sunday night. Unless you get There super early and plan to stay the entire time. 

The servers dont even acknowledge you.. It took ours over twenty minutes to get a drink order. Then, she was absent the rest of the night. We went up to the bar to pay our bill since she didn&#39;t even give us our check. If they didn&#39;t have my card I would have certainly dined&amp; dashed. And, the food is okay.. The peach sangria was kinda gross. I should&#39;ve gotten beer. 

Oh TG, I thought I loved you .. Please PLEASE get it together!! Cause I really wanna come back!

I&#39;m not a golfer, but I think this is really fun. It&#39;s a great way to hang out with the golfers in your life but not have to spend hours slogging in the heat, carrying a bag and being miserable (yes, this is how I see a day at the golf course). The driving bays are covered, there&#39;s music playing, and someone will bring you drinks -- that&#39;s my idea of golfing. And even if you&#39;ve never picked up a club, you&#39;ll be able to score some points and maybe even be competitive.

I&#39;ve been here maybe three times, and each one is a let down when it comes to service. Every time, there&#39;s been a long wait, and they don&#39;t do a good job of estimating how much time it will take to get you into a bay. The wait service is usually bad -- I&#39;ve never had a flawless experience. Either I get the wrong drink or the wrong bill or the waitress never comes around. The last time we were here, we were in our bay for only one round (which goes quickly with only two people) before they told us we either had to finish up or had to move because there was a child&#39;s birthday party. Why did they put us here, then?"

It is setup to be a social, fun environment and it doesn&#39;t fail.  I wish the games were a bit more cost effective, but with all the technology involved I can understand why it&#39;s more expensive than the mom &amp; pop driving range.  I would love to go weekly, but the budget doesn&#39;t allow for that.  A great social environment for date night with my wife or a group outing with friends.

This place is in such demand it is very difficult to find a bay, unless you are like my wife and I and head there on Valentine&#39;s Day when it was nearly subzero wind chill.  Even on this day, there were customers having a good time and the staff was more than helpful."

It is definitely food like my mom or Lola used to make that I crave.  However, like many of the reviews I&#39;ve read, there are complaints about the price and rude service. I agree. I don&#39;t speak Tagalog and sometimes feel the servers are rude in their responses when I tell them this. Also, I&#39;ve called ahead 24 hours for an order at a specific time and it sometimes it Isn&#39;t even ready or it takes a while to find my order.  Once a guy at the counter asked me what I wanted but then said he was done for the day so I had to wait for someone else to help me. Really, then why even ask what I need? Another time our chicken stick was raw. When I asked about cooking it longer, next time I was in, I was told, &#34;but the problem is the outside will burn.&#34; No, the problem is you&#39;re serving raw chicken!

I gave this store an extra star because the Filipino food here is delicious. My family has been ordering food from here for a very long time. Their egg rolls are great. 

The reason why I would give them only one star, aside from the star for good food, is their lack of customer service. 

On one occasion, we ordered lechon for a big birthday party several weeks in advance. When we called the day before to confirm pick up time, they told us that they didn&#39;t have an order for us and that they lost our receipt. The woman we dealt with argued with us and told us we didn&#39;t put it an order when we had a physical copy of the receipt. Fortunately we were still able to get our lechon.

Today, I ordered a Pineapple Strawberry smoothie. The man I spoke to disappeared into the back room with a younger woman. I waited for 5 minutes for her to come back out and confirm my order. I also asked if I could have tapioca and lychee jelly. She took my order and went into the back room again. I waited for another 5 minutes for her to come out and tell me that I can only have one, tapioca or lychee jelly. Although it said nothing on their sign that I can only choose one, I chose lychee jelly. She again goes to the back. I wait for another 5 minutes and she comes out with my shake. I noticed the tapioca so I asked her if the lychee jelly was in it. She seemed irritated when I asked her and repeated that I can only choose one. I told her I understood and that I ordered lychee jelly. She hesitated then asked if she wanted it re-made. Considering the annoyed look on her face and the fact that I waited a total of 15 minutes for this smoothie, I wasn&#39;t willing to stick around any longer. I told her it was fine and went to the register to pay for it. I told the cashier, who also happened to be the manager, that the order was wrong. He also offered to have it re-made but I told him that it took too long to make a shake and that I had to leave. He didn&#39;t seem apologetic or empathetic. He didn&#39;t apologize at all. He charged me full price and that was it. I could have left the smoothie but I was hoping that it would maybe be a happy mistake. I was wrong. The smoothie was basically a chunky fruit mash with tapioca pearls. The tapioca had an unpleasant texture. They were way too soft. I&#39;ve worked in the food industry and tend to be very understanding in these situations but one thing I can&#39;t stand is poor customer service. 

Get the food here but NOT THE SMOOTHIES. NOT WORTH $5. Double check your orders before you leave, just in case the people I&#39;ve dealt with are dealing with your orders."

Another girl came up to help me and repeatedly touched her nose and face while she was putting together my order.  I told the worman at the register that this was not proper food handling and she didn&#39;t say anything while she also touched her nose and face.

+ Has Filipino grocery items if you are craving Filipino snacks, canned goods, condiments, and spices

+ Has BDO (Banco de Oro) Remittance Center if you want to send money to the Philippines

CONS:
- Expensive. $9 for a fried bangus (milk fish).  $4 to $5 for canned corned beef and canned spam.  No thanks.

- Vegetables, fruits and pastries are not fresh

- Some shelves sit empty and are not replenished right away

- Dirty and dusty

Brought it back, sans receipt, of course, but with the tag and they said no receipt, no refund, and yes they changed the mixture.

Due to the recent snowstorm, parking can be difficult, but typically it&#39;s not too crowded so you can find a space up front.

The store itself is pretty small.  There is a limited produce section with some regional fruits and vegetables that aren&#39;t always fresh or cheap.  The meat section is good.  They have a good variety of meats and cuts such as longanisa and chorizo as well as short rib cuts of meat.  There are a few dry item aisles with plenty of Filipino origin goods and a frozen aisle in the middle.  There are refrigerated items on the east end of the store.

In the back, is the main hot food area which IMHO is the best part of the store.  They take catering orders and show the various pan sizes.  I go for the 2 item platter - $6.99 ($4.99 for the 1 item).  Last time, I had the beef kaldereta and pancit palabok.  They give you plenty of rice but also plenty of the main dishes.  The beef was simmered for a long time as it fell cleanly off the bone.  The pancit just came out of the oven and the employee stirred it up before putting in the dish.  They also have plenty of baked goods since they also house the Original Baker&#39;s Delight there.  Great stuff to try out!"

I am their true Pancit (noodles) fan!  Flavoured perfectly and not going cheap on the veggies!  Its a true budget buy, $6 gets you a huge container that could probably feed 3 for lunch.  Not kidding either...

Cooked foods seem to be the popular call, with many patrons walking home with 12-inch platters this recent weekend. PLUS, if you hate the idea of stinking up your house with fried fish, they&#39;ll do so for FREE on Thursdays. Yes, purchase your fresh catch and have the kitchen cook it for you. I&#39;m so returning."

I came in on a Thursday morning and the place was empty. I walked in to find no hostess, I stood there for a bit looking around. She finally came over and seated me. 
The place is very spacious, pleasant looking. 
She asks me if I want coffee and I say yes, she asks if I will be needing cream, I said yes. She brings over a tiny little cream pitcher but no coffee. I sat there waiting for her to return, about 5 minutes or so and I ask her for coffee. The fact that she forgot to give me coffee and the place is dead is not good. 
I looked over the menu and they have a lot of yummy options. I went with the huevos rancheros. 2 poached eggs, with skirt steak, salsa and avocado. It came with a side of over roasted potatoes. 
Food came out quickly and my meal looked delicious. I found it strange that my eggs were kind of Benedict style with an English muffin under the steak. I didn&#39;t care for the English muffin so I removed it. My steak was absolutely perfect! It was a nice size, it had a fantastic flavor and it was so tender and juicy. My entire meal was delicious! The server ended up being really nice, she checked on me and was pleasant to chat with. I took a menu for the times I want to order carry out while on lunch at work. I can&#39;t wait to try the rest of the menu."

I came with 3 kids and asked the oldest to go inside and get us a table while my toddler walked(slowly) inside. By the time we get there, he&#39;s still waiting, there were plenty of open tables. 
We were greeted by our waitress right away and she seemed nice. She hugged the people sitting next to us with made me feel they come there often (they knew everyone&#39;s names). 
They serve muffins which I thought was very cute. I would have preferred them to bring it out with the food of after so the kids don&#39;t dig into those first. 
I ordered the veggie skillet, chocolate chip pancakes, and a letter pancake. I think it&#39;s great that they do special things for the kids, makes them love eating their food hat much more. Kids loved their pancakes (obviously they would). The skillet was horrible. No flavor, very bland. I had to use a ton of hot sauce, and still ending up just leaving it. 
I have no intentions of coming back."

My wife and I were disappointed with our food this morning. My Meat Lovers Scramble was flavorless, even after adding pepper. She was disappointed with her Scramble as well. 

We hadn&#39;t been here in awhile, but we always enjoyed our meals, we thought the kitchen was top notch when it came to quality and attention to detail. 

Somebody dropped the ball today.

The service was good. The waitress kept our coffee mugs filled. The food, as mediocre as it was, was delivered quickly.

The lady at the register was not very nice upon us entering when she asked us how many in our party to seat us nor when she rang us up at the end of our meal.  She was very abrupt and had a pretty rude tone when speaking to us.  

The food served here is your standard breakfast items and I ordered the Meat Lovers skillet and my friend had the Berry Belgian Waffles.  My skillet was a bit greasy but I suppose that&#39;s to be expected when it comes with ham, bacon, and sausage!  The coffee served here is your basic diner coffee so don&#39;t expect anything fancy but it does the job.

katies-kitchen-des-plaines,Lauren K.,5hbs6TwGyT2YQKeN3xef_A,"Lake Forest, IL",1,1,1,437,45,3I5Rpbc1q9vOKzZ1QIWaow,5.0,2015-10-06,"Katie&#39;s Kitchen has taken their pancake game to a whole other level with that Apple Campfire Pancake, arguably one of the best pancakes (if you can even call it that - I&#39;d call it a masterpiece) that I&#39;ve ever eaten.  This, a-hem, masterpiece is similar to that infamous baked apple pancake that you can order at the Walker Brother&#39;s Pancake House, but I&#39;d almost say that this Apple Campfire Pancake outranks them.  It was that delicious.  I knew from the minute I walked in the door that I was going to order this glorious creation, but I had to wait for 20 minutes to be seated and 30 more minutes for the pancake to be baked before I could sink my teeth into its gooiness.  

Let me rewind for a minute - ya know how I said I had to wait for 20 minutes when arriving?  Well you should know that when I arrived it was 11 am on a Sunday which in other words, is prime time for brunch.  Considering how many people were ahead of me in line a 20 minute wait was extremely tolerable.  Once we were seated we were greeted immediately with water by our server who was very patient with us since we hadn&#39;t even picked up the menu (due to our incessant babbling and catching up - you know how girl talk is) after she&#39;d come by to take our order three times in 20 minutes.  Finally we were set and I ordered that wonderfully sinful-looking pancake which came out 30 short minutes later sizzling and steaming in its skillet.  

Although all of the other food looked and smelled wonderful all around me, I only had eyes for the Apple Campfire Pancake.  In case you&#39;re wondering exactly what it is it&#39;s like a two inch thick conglomeration of fluffy pancake dough, cinnamon-glazed apples and candied walnuts.  I know your mouth is watering at the sound of this so go on in and fill yourself up with all the calories you&#39;d need in a week.  My godmother ordered the eggs benedict which looked extremely good, but not nearly as good as my Apple Campfire Pancake.  For the amount of food that comes in each entr√©e the prices are fair and very affordable!  

This definitely seems like a family place as the entire restaurant was filled with families, many of whom knew each other and stopped bye each other&#39;s table to say a quick &#34;hello&#34;.  Katie&#39;s Kitchen seems to be the perfect and friendly place to catch up with people or come have a brunch after a long morning or before a long day.  Be sure you don&#39;t go too late in the morning, though, because they close at 1 pm, at least on Sunday&#39;s - it is only a breakfast and brunch place after all.  Now I can&#39;t speak for the items that existed on their lunch menu, but I&#39;d probably stick with the breakfast items - that&#39;s just my opinion though.  

Okay - stop reading and start eating!"

I received a nasty message - a &#34;compliment&#34; from a seemingly childless Yelper who was bored to tears by what follows this paragraph. I get it, but, good news: I didn&#39;t write it for you childless types, who may go anywhere and do anything with abandon (and in silence and with no bag of kid crap, literal and figurative). And may the toasty Yelp guy be blessed one day with at least triplets and find himself trapped in some restaurant with no crayons, no booster seats, and waitstaff who think toddlers can wait 15 minutes for their milk. 

I digress. 

This is a pretty decent spot to breakfast with toddlers, if you are forced to be in this part of Chicagoland. They got us in on Mother&#39;s Day with no reservation in 5 minutes, not 30 like they told us at first. But as important to ensuring that the youngest members of our party continued to be kind to the other patrons:

-kids cups with lids and DINOSAURS on them and crayons/colorable placemats.

-kids menu with letter-shaped pancakes and also Mickey Mouse pancakes (w/ chocolate chips but I bet they would skip those); and

-seemingly flexible waitstaff and kitchen...no annoyance when we, in typical people-with-kids-who-think-their-kids-are-special-and-need-more-than-sugar-for-breakfast fashion (sorry, childless Yelp guy!!), asked them to skip the sprinkles, whip cream, and dental fallout causing fairy dust and instead throw some kind of fresh fruit on them.

These things together ensured that the childless (at least at the time) people around us could enjoy their eggs benedict - and that I could enjoy mine!"

I got some variation of the Country Scrambler (after a long deliberation since the menu options were extensive and everything looked so good) and it was delicious!

Id rather give my business to Elly&#39;s in Glenview, Rise and Dine in Wheeling or anywhere else where service is important. There is no food good enough to be treated in the manner in which these people do so. And, if they don&#39;t know you, be prepared to be treated worse. Not worth it at all."

Greeted with strawberry chocolate chip mini muffins, a nice touch.... Pretty good would of liked them warm... Hey it FREE!

This place would never be found without Yelp.... Hidden in a crowded shopping center... A little outdated, but you can tell they have their repeat customers... Resturant can be split into two sections.... When we were there there was a business meeting in the other section.... 

My Wife order the special... Mexican Omelet and I decided to order the Skirt Steak which was the reason why I drove up here from Elgin when I saw the picture on Yelp....

The skirt steak was amazing with the country style Potatoes... Skin on like it should be... 

Omelet was really good as well.  The Syrup they use is really good and different from all other places we have been at.

Drink wear is unique compared to typical breakfast places... Square top and much smaller coffee mugs which I love, more visits from the server and my coffee is always hot.

Mary was the only server for 8 tables and never skipped a beat.... Great job Mary

My daughter and I split a steak &amp; eggs. It came with red potatoes &amp; onions, two pancakes and two over easy eggs. Steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and was more than enough for two people!!!

The steak had some homemade Marinade which wasn&#39;t your standard steak &amp; eggs- it was delicious!!!! 

Overall warm place, we were seated right away and attended to perfectly. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was getting my check put on the table before I finished my food- that is a pet peeve of mine- but to the waitresses defense I could see she was closing up to go home. I&#39;ll let that go since I loved my food so much.

bad habit of picking up the glasses from the top using her fingers and palm of her hand.

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. Wood trim and deep, dark, muted tones make it feel like grandma&#39;s living room is right through the next door.

Bright and friendly, the hostess cheers your arrival, ready to seat you at the most comfortable spot available.

As soon as we sit down, the waitress brings a plate with three mini pistachio muffins- one for daddy and each of the boys. So warm and sweet. What nice way to start the day...

The menu items are exceptional and creative as well as plenty of the standards.

The shredded hash browns are super crispy and golden on the outside and steamy in the inside. They are unseasoned but that&#39;s how I like them... I&#39;ll season them myself.  Thanks!

The pancakes are huge and fluffy with a good chewiness on the flat sides and perfectly malted, to boot! X! L! N! TAY!!

The roasted potatoes are quartered and so roasty, so toasty, garlicky, oniony, crispety, crunchery, buttery, crusty, and potatoey... Heavenly.  Really. 

The marinated skirt steak was the plumpest, juiciest, and most well-marinated cut I&#39;ve had recently... But as far as skirts steaks... It was phenomenal. Very tender and expertly prepared- medium with lots of red and pink but crispy edges.

The bacon is thick- but not as thick as anyone who would knock this place. If you want &#34;fast&#34; service and food, go to McDumbdumb&#39;s... the service here isn&#39;t slow at all... It&#39;s relaxed yet attentive. 

It wasn&#39;t busy when we came on a Wednesday morning and the service was top notch.

As the tables filled up, the waitress new everyone&#39;s names. All regulars. 

Definitely in my top three breakfast spots for this neck of the woods.

BTW for all you parents with youngins... The kiddie cups are sealed tight and the bendy straws make spills nonexistent.

In short- go for the muffins, stay for the check... I mean, you gotta pay for what you eat, right?"

The menu is huge. I looked at it for a good 10 minutes before our waitress came to take our order and I still had no idea what I wanted! Everything looked and sounded amazing. My husband had the special breakfast burrito which looked and smelled amazing. I had the crab cake Benedict which was amazing and the red potatoes that come with it, yum! We also decided to split a Dutch baby which I haven&#39;t had since I was a kid and he had never had. OMG WAS THIS THING AMAZING!!! A million times better than I remembered!

We were seated immediately in a great little booth.  The coffee came quickly and the refills didn&#39;t stop.  Good thing I stopped counting how many cups I drank because I think I went a little overboard.

The restaurant is very &#39;mom and pop&#39; - located in a pretty generic strip mall off Wolf Road.  The service is quick, efficient, and friendly.  The menu is large, with a lot of different fresh options.  I went with the green eggs benedict (english muffins, pulled pork, perfectly poached eggs, salsa verde, and a side of breakfast potatoes) and my friend got the vegetable scrambler with toast.  Her&#39;s looked very tasty, but mine was AMAZING.  The salsa verde perfectly complimented the eggs and pulled pork, and was a lighter alternative to a heavy hollandaise.  The roasted potatoes on the side were also totally on point.  And our waitress was friendly, as were all the other staff (frequent coffee and water refills - I normally don&#39;t drink coffee, so after like 4 cups, I pretty much vibrated my way out of there).  My friend and I lingered over our food for nearly two hours, catching up and gabbing (she&#39;s leaving for an out of country trip for more than a month, so we wanted time to hang out) - and the staff was all super nice and never rushed us.  We made sure to tip our waitress handsomely, as we had held one of her tables hostage for so long.

Reviewing on today&#39;s lunch with family. Eight of us enjoyed a time of good food and conversation after church. Took a few minutes to wait for a table, but not bad - though I&#39;ve seen quite a line at times.

The service was excellent, with someone almost always nearby when we needed something. Had to seek out a server once or twice, but only for a minute or so.

The food was very good! I ordered the turkey burger since it sounded interesting and a bit different, and upgraded to sweet potato fries. The portion size was fairly small for the burger, but the flavor was great! The sweet potato fries were also very good. Most people seemed to enjoy their meal, and none seemed to have issues with them.

The prices are good for the food you get, and the atmosphere is comfortable, if not exciting or trendy.

As far as groups, I join the Des Plaines Chamber of Commerce here every first Friday, and they do an amazing job! There are often 20-30 of us, and they serve a great buffet with eggs, hash browns, fresh fruit and some baked items. A great variety and always fresh. The service is also good, with the plates taken away almost as soon as you&#39;re done eating.

Mostly a breakfast / lunch place, but they started serving dinner some evenings as well. I haven&#39;t yet tried their dinner, so can&#39;t offer an opinion on it at this time. ;)"

First experience: May 23
To start, they gave us mini-pistachio muffins that were great. a simple bite to whet the appetite. Subtle nut flavor. Very moist and fresh.
Wife: Veggie Nest
Me: Cinnamon Roll french toast.

The Nest is a blanket of hash brown  that swallow your veggies and eggs (or meat if you so choose). This dish is what contributes to american obesity - it was so large and delicious, we ate as much as we could before we couldn&#39;t eat anymore. The hash browns are cooked lightly, not over fried and hard. The eggs and veggies are cooked nicely as well.

The cinnamon roll french toast is a nice twist on french toast - bear in mind - this kind of dish is also what America is overweight, but who can blame us: IT WAS DELICIOUS. Homemade cinnamon roll, lightly battered in an egg wash and fried on a pan. 

Second experience: May 31
(no pistachio muffins this time. Boo)
Wife: peach-banana baked oatmeal
Me: monthly special: very berry waffle (half strawberry waffle, half blueberry waffle, topped with fresh blueberries and strawberries).
When they first brought my breakfast out, I was a little disappointed. I thought the waffle was just a plain waffle with berries as a topping. Wow was I in for a treat. The fruity batter is just perfect. You don&#39;t get chunks of fruit, but a nice balanced flavor of strawberry or blueberry depending on which side of the waffle you&#39;re eating. The berries on top were really just a luxury.

My wife&#39;s Peach-banana baked oatmeal was also incredible. Soft and gooey oatmeal, with warm peaches and bananas with a hint of brown sugar crumbles (I think). Warm fruit may not be for everyone, but it was definitely for us that morning. Also - this bowl of oatmeal was more like a swamp of oatmeal. It came in a large soup bowl, not your typical small bowl of oatmeal you would get at maybe Eggsperience of Egg Harbor.

All in all, Katie&#39;s Kitchen serves up some really unique dishes for breakfast and I look forward to the next trip to try something new delicious.

Not to mention - the prices are extremely reasonable."

It was an interesting combo with pistachio cool whip and topped with strawberries. Our meal came with a side and we chose pancakes over toast.

But the menu is overly pretentious and the prices are not in line for the neighborhood, especially since it can&#39;t quite deliver on quality. 

If you go in looking for a run-of-the-mill diner, Katie&#39;s Kitchen fits the bill. Unfortunately, for a menu that waxes over cajun remoulade on foccacia or chipolte and garlic mayos, all at nearly twice the price of quicker lunches, it falls far short. 

My meal was a specialty beef brisket sandwich with a side soup, fries, and fresh baked beans. The fries were overcooked to the point of being chewy. The baked beans were a watery mess of beans, bacon, and bits of crumbled hamburger. The brisket was surprisingly well cooked, but marred by the sickly-sweet flavor of what seemed like cheap store bought barbecue sauce. 

The soup was a broccoli cheese which tasted almost entirely of corn syrup and potatoes and had the tell-tale sign of overthickening - when the spoon can be left in without falling over. In the reviews I&#39;ve heard from co-workers meals here can be hit or miss. 

Perhaps if it had a menu that didn&#39;t overreach and more reasonable prices it would be more often a hit, but as is, this one was a miss for me."

Our waitress brought over an amuse bouche of two mini muffins, which were delicious and welcome as I was starving.

I ended up ordering the healthy breakfast option, which included nine-grain toast, scrambled egg whites, yogurt with fruit and granola and turkey sausage. It was excellent. Just the right amount of food and all cooked as I specified.

I ordered a skillet which consisted of mushrooms, crispy bacon, onions, sunny side upeggs, and potatoes. It came with a side of pancakes or toast (I asked for pancakes). My skillet was just okay...a little below average for my liking. There&#39; were a lot of crispy bacons. I didn&#39;t mind that but some parts taste burnt. The portabello mushrooms were diced so I couldn&#39;t eat much of it and there weren&#39;t much. The overall taste was just okay. Could be better. Pancakes was eh....

Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t feeling it. We waited almost an hour for only two entr√©es. Our server looked like she was doing her best, but she just didn&#39;t have any help. By the time our food arrived, it was lukewarm. Clearly, the food was plated long before it was finally served to us. Why it took so long to get from the serving station to our table, I&#39;ll never know.

Everyone was friendly, but wow -- when it&#39;s obvious the wait staff is overwhelmed, the manager shouldn&#39;t be sitting around gabbing with patrons. He should&#39;ve been helping out the overwhelmed wait staff.

The Skirt Steak Benedict I had was okay. The steak itself was very good. The poached eggs, however, were cooked too long. They weren&#39;t runny like they&#39;re supposed to be on a Benedict. The rest of the plate was pretty boring.

We ordered a side of bacon and asked that it be prepared extra-crispy. It came out with the consistency of wet jerky.

I ordered a side of corned beef hash. The (overwhelmed) server neglected to put the order in. Why she didn&#39;t write it down, I don&#39;t really know. Regardless, the plate didn&#39;t come out until we were almost ready to leave.

I&#39;m not really sure why everyone raves about this place. Normally I&#39;ll give a spot a few visits before I write it off, but this place just isn&#39;t worth the time."

I have never felt as horrible as I did today.  Sitting in a table with no acknowledgment for 15 minutes is ridiculous.  They obviously don&#39;t need my business.  

The worst part was the waitress telling the &#34;owner&#34; who ever was working as the hostess that I was crazy and then the &#34;owner&#34; asking me to go back and covering up and making excuses for the waitress.

Again, the perception is that, that restaurant or maybe the waitress with the long blonde bob does not or will not cater to the Hispanic population.

I had read the Yelp reviews and was anxious to try but somewhat pessimistic as it is hard for a breakfast place to differentiate itself in the land of pancake houses.  Katie&#39;s did a great job, though.  I had a scramble with bacon, ham and sausage and was much better than any meat lovers scramble I have had anywhere else.  The crisp bacon gave it a really nice flavor and texture and the sausage was integrated well rather than over powering the dish.  I was also happy that I could substitute pumpkin pancakes as the side instead of the normal pancakes. made for a much more interesting breakfast.  Nice, friendly server rounded out the experience."

I ordered a Denver Omelette and it was fantastic. Fresh ingredients and a huge fluffy omelette. Makes me wonder why more restaurants don&#39;t put their eggs for omelettes through a mixmaster, the presentation is so much better. Hash browns were nicely done as well.

When you&#39;re on the hunt for comfort food, variety, and a welcoming atmosphere, Katie&#39;s Kitchen has got it all.

At first, the pages after pages of menu offerings can seem overwhelming, but the truth is, Katie&#39;s sticks to a set of ingredients and offers a plethora of ways to eat them. Breakfast, for example, offers eggs, potatoes, a few different sausages, and any veggie you can think of. You can order these in any combination but in a few key dishes. Omelets are just what you&#39;d expect. Scramblers are what you&#39;d expect. But nests are these same ingredients offered in a omelet but then wrapped in a &#34;nest&#34; of has browns. Whatever you&#39;re in the taste for, in whatever style, you&#39;re likely to find it.

The lunch and dinner options are plentiful and satisfying as well. I tried the the steak grilled panini, which was cooked well and tasty. You&#39;ll also find daily special cupcakes the size of two fists put together.

The restaurant is clean, servers are friendly and efficient, and the menu choices are always a hit. You&#39;re sure to leave Katie&#39;s Kitchen with plans to return. Whether you&#39;re in the mood for savory or sweet, breakfast or lunch, you&#39;ll find it here."

A few months ago me and my friend came over for bfast on a regular weekday, the order came put after 35-40 mins with the lame excuse that they had a party and the kitchen was backed up.... 
Today we went there again and we were  seated by their little dish station which was VERY LOUD when they were taking or bringing silverware or glasses... The order  came out again very very late, it was cold same as the toast! The waitress came by and asked us if everything is ok but talking to someone else at the same time (i guess she takes it after her mom- the hostess- who s also very rude!)
When we let we told the hostess about our concerns and all she did was say &#34;sorry,that s always like that on a Sunday&#34;- like she really didn t care that we were unsatisfied, and all this time she rushed to have us charged so we could leave! So rude!

If I have to give one complaint, it is that they have occasionally run out of items on the menu.  Also, I have taken a few items to go which don&#39;t seem to travel well.

There are baked goods sold at the counter which I have enjoyed a couple of times.  It is mostly an &#34;older&#34; crowd and it can get very busy around lunch, but usually not much of a wait. A very quality restaurant!"

We&#39;ve found that the website is a bit challenging to order online when you want to do some substitutions so its always nice to talk to someone who understands you. 
The estimated times are, for the most part, on time in regards to figuring out when to leave your house and pick it up. (So that way it isn&#39;t too soggy by waiting too long) 
If you want your pizza a little crispy, Id&#39; recommend for you to not cut your pizza until you get home. Thank god they give you the option to have it cut or not."

In the past when ever we get thin crust it is super crispy when you get a crust piece but extremely soggy when you get a center piece. Knowing this, I called in the order and explained that the thin crust is always soggy when you get a center piece, and they suggested I get it well done, which didn&#39;t seem to help. 
Not to mention, they gave use the wrong order because there were two orders with the same last name (they compensated with a free slice of tiramisu). 
I think I will definitely stick with deep dish when getting pizza from Lou&#39;s even though the thin crust seems more guilt free."

I&#39;m going to go a little backwards here and start with service.

Apparently the staff here is hard of hearing. This past Saturday, my wife and I had taste for pizza so she did a call in for a medium thin crust with sausage, spinach and giardinera peppers (our favorite combination). Upon arriving, I was charged $27 &amp; some change; I&#39;m like for a MEDIUM??!! WOW! So all the way home, I complained about how overpriced this location is &amp; how I&#39;ll never return. Get home, open the box and there&#39;s a deep dish pizza sitting there. That certainly explained the price but I was disgruntled because we clearly didn&#39;t order deep dish.

Now that my service rant is over, now it&#39;s time for taste. The pizza was good. This isn&#39;t my first time having Lou Malnatti&#39;s so I kinda knew what to expect. Though I wasn&#39;t planning on deep dish, it still delivered well. Nice amount of sauce, enough ingredients and plentiful crust. Will return whenever I&#39;m in the mood for deep dish."

Ordering process was easy and quick. Ordered a spinach + mushroom. Quoted 35 minutes and I went then and it was ready at the stated time. The counter service was friendly.
Now for the pizza.....it was OK. Not great, not bad. I do like the tartness of their tomatoes but I thought the crust was a bit too hard and it was not inexpensive either. I know a lot of people love Lou Malnati&#39;s. I&#39;m on the fence on this one since it is not really my preference style of pizza.

Been hearing about this place on food tv so I&#39;d give it a shot!
If you pay by credit card there&#39;s a line for gratuity even if you&#39;re ordering at the counter to pick up your own order to take away on your own to take to your own car, so they will be staring at you as you write the check. You will end up giving one anyway for fear of what they might do to your food. Much like a ransom.
The classic I got was pretty average. I think the satisfaction comes from the load of carbs, fat and salt that&#39;s injested, much like a class 3 drug. Taste was aight. However the salad that I ordered as pretty amazing. Fresher than some salad places I know. Go for the salad, there&#39;s enough deep fried bacon to keep you manly"

I have learned that sometimes we just don&#39;t know what anyone is going through at he moment we encounter one another.  It is a possibility that she was in a bad mood.  Never really know. 

Let me back up for a minute.  Customer service aspect was just saved by a nice young man who was very kind in making a sure I got all my order and even though it was busy, got me what other items I asked for.  He even asked to help me bring my food to the car.

Anyway, I ordered a pizza, wings, and cheesey bread for pick up at 7pm. Got in there, paid, and still had to wait like 10-15 min for my food. Not sure if it was still being made, reheated, or what not. They were pretty bust since about 8 more customers came in and left by the time I got my food. Maybe the wings take longer?

Anyway, the Lou is delicious as always. The cheesey bread was alright, the sauce was too liquidy for my taste though. The wings were surprisingly good though. I&#39;ve never had them before and they had really good taste. Some were kind of small though and I think 9 wings came in a small order.

Weird story though, a guy came in and took 3 cans of pop from the fridge. Then asked if they sell slices. They said no, and he paid $3.20 for the pop. I&#39;m not sure what the going rate is, but I think for a few bucks more he could have just went to the grocery store and had 9 more cans...."

They put a whole patty of sausage not just chunks of sausage and then top it with chunks of tomato. The chunks of tomato can easily add moisture to the dough during delivery. Overall, still satisfying and plenty of leftovers. For leftovers, I preheat the oven to 450 and place it directly on the rack to regain that crispy crust."

When it comes to pizza, I keep it simple. Pan or deep dish crust, and cheese. Don&#39;t get me wrong though, I love veggies, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, grilled portabella and asparagus. I&#39;m also not a vegetarian, either. Love me some bacon, salmon, or a nice steak. So when I first tasted Lou&#39;s sausage deep dish, I was shocked. It was a revelation. The clouds parted and the sun beams shown down on my perfect slice of deep dish.

The crust was light and buttery, but crispy, especially on the outer edges. To me, it makes the pizza...I look forward to it. The sauce is seasoned perfectly and not too sweet or salty. It has chunks of tomato that go perfectly with the amazingly seasoned layer of tasty sausage that, mind you, covers the whole surface of pizza. I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.

They recommend not cutting it. Listen to them. They know their pizza. It contains every little drop of goodness within the crispy crust.

A lot of the bad reviews have been about service. I&#39;ve had delivery and pick-up orders and both have been on time or early. Maybe once it was 5-10 minutes off but at peak hours, it&#39;s a given, and totally worth it. Had one delivered to my bf as a surprise and they were kind enough to write a message on the box for me. Ordered one during the Hawks playoff game, at peak hours, was a little early, and it was all ready to go and STILL hot and delicious when we got home."

I usually get a thin crust with either sausage or pepperoni, or The Lou, which has tomatoes, spinach, garlic, and multiple cheeses.  I&#39;ve also tried bruschetta, ravioli, and lasagna -- all good,  with lasagna being my favorite. Garlic bread is usually soggy but that seems to be a standard issue for takeout. Staff always pleasant on phone and in person. 

Negative. Don&#39;t let this keep you away,  but we have never once walked in and found our order ready.  It doesn&#39;t matter what time they told us it would be ready, or whether we waited 15 minutes past the stated  preparation time to show up. On walking in and paying, the order still takes at least 5 minutes extra and usually closer to15 minutes extra. This is not a one-time thing. We&#39;ve probably ordered takeout 15 to 20 times over the past 8 years and it&#39;s always a wait. I do see a few people walk in and walk out immediately with their order, but most others wait like we do. Strangely, our home-delivery orders are always delivered earlier than stated. 

Again, the late thing is seriously not a reason to stay away. Just don&#39;t plan to walk in and walk right out with your order immediately. Order a little earlier than you need it, just in case."

The deep-dish Buttercrust leaks grease everywhere, and lately the sausage has been gristly. *PTOOEY!* They use the same dough for their thin crust, which isn&#39;t my idea of thin-crust pie at all. The pizzaioli in Naples would have a heart attack.

Do not order onions on your pizza here; since they&#39;re diced rather large, there&#39;s too much surface area for the moisture to properly evaporate when cooking, so the liquid seeps out and makes a horrendous, watery mess that will require lots of Bounty to sop up. Chances are, your box will disintegrate like mine did."

(The initial contact occurred via email within 48 hours of my review which impressed me). Both reps apologized for the service I experienced (as I said previously, the pizza was GREAT) and thanked me for my honest feedback.  I spoke with the district manager (Steve) and he was great.  He took ownership of poor service and made me that corrective actions will be taken to improve things.  At the top of the list is improve communication with the staff at this locations and the customers when time windows are missed during peak periods. Because of this follow up my rating has changed from 2 to 3 stars.  Again, had service been better when I picked up my pizza I would have easily given a 4 or 5 star rating.


Lou&#39;s is one of my favorite Chicago pizzerias.  I did carryout and as always the pizza was great! The service was horrible. When I called in my order they told me it would be ready in 45 minutes. It ended up taking 65 minutes. On top of that the staff did not provide any updates as I waited until I asked. After that the staff would come out to give me an update but always have my name and/or order incorrect. Had service been better I would have rated 4 or 5 stars."

The Lou Malnati&#39;s located off of Army Trail Road in Bloomingdale is just a short distance from my work and having ordered from here on quite a few occasions I figured it would be fair  to throw together a quick review. One important note is I&#39;ve never visited this Lou&#39;s in person, I have only had pizza that has been delivered to my office from here.

The first thing to note is that Lou Malnati&#39;s is famous for their deep dish pizza. I&#39;ve had both the thin crust and deep dish from this particular Lou&#39;s, so I&#39;ll take some time and cover both. 

The Deep Dish pizza here has a thick buttery crust. The problem is that when cooking it seems like the butter seeps out quite a bit and leaves you with an extremely messy sloppy crust. This isn&#39;t every time either, sometimes they either put less butter on it, or prepare it in some other way so it isn&#39;t as sloppy. When it&#39;s dryer, the crust is a little less flavorful but is firm. When it&#39;s wet the pizza practically falls apart when lifting it on to your plate and this moisture will displace the cheese and layer of sauce above the pizza as well. The sauce used here is another inconsistent ingredient in my experiences. Sometimes it&#39;s well stirred and has various seasoning and is more like a traditional pizza sauce. Other times it&#39;s like stewed tomatoes and a few spices were poured on your pizza. The toppings (which on deep dish pizza go on the bottom) have been decent, and like Gino&#39;s East they offer a sausage patty rather than individual pieces of sausage. Overall my experience with Lou&#39;s famous deep dish has been very inconsistent, while at times I&#39;ve had good deep dish here, more often than not the sauce, the crust or something else has been wrong. Frequently the pizza here is so wet it effects the consistency of the crust leading to some sloppy hard to eat pizza and a just puddle of grease left afterwards.

So for a place famous for their deep dish pizza, you would expect the thin crust to be worse right? Well... no..... I actually thought the thin crust was a little better than their deep dish. The crust was crispy, no problems have been experiences with stewed tomatoes instead of sauce as you wouldn&#39;t be able to put such thick pieces of tomato in-between the layer of cheese. And the pizza was surprisingly grease free, this is especially shocking considering how messy the deep dish was. Overall I thought the thin crust was above average and actually haven&#39;t had a bad experience with it, though it failed to knock my socks off either.

Overall the inconsistent deep dish pizza served here really brings down the score. I&#39;ve not visited many other Lou&#39;s locations (I&#39;ve had pizza from two others in the past) to compare whether or not this consistency problem is specific to this location or across the board, but it&#39;s worth noting I&#39;ve had a few co-workers insist that their local Lou Malnati&#39;s location is better. For now I&#39;m giving the Bloomingdale Lou Malnati&#39;s two stars. You can get some good pizza here, but it isn&#39;t a given."
lou-malnatis-pizzeria-bloomingdale,Mike G.,0GgQCKyrNwLRWO8yiRrOxA,"Roselle, IL",0,1,0,0,93,wj_wExjFdxtlVwfO7yK2Yg,5.0,2014-02-07,"Lou Malnati&#39;s is and has always been my favorite pizza, hands down.  My dad introduced Lou&#39;s pizza to my family and I have fond memories of enjoying this pizza even at a very young age.  I have introduced my wife&#39;s family to it and they love it.

I really have nothing negative to say...  Maybe I wish there was more locations, my previous residence I was in a Lou Malnati&#39;s Dead Zone where I could not get delivery, and since moving it is a legitimate PRO, that I am not only back in delivery range, but have a Lou&#39;s minutes away :)

Sure, I see some customer service issues in other posts, and that happens, you can&#39;t make 100% of the people out there happy 100% of the time, and as Americans, I know we are much more likely to post a 1 time negative experience than post about the last 10 times we had a great experience.

I have eaten Lou Malnati&#39;s hundreds of times probably in the last 30 years of my 34 years on earth.  And I&#39;ll tell you, customer service has been as good if not on average much better than other pizza places, and the quality, TASTE, and satisfaction from Lou&#39;s Pizza is unmatched.  I maybe one time got a pizza delivered that was a little soggy, 1 out of a hundred, not bad.  And even that pizza the worst Lou&#39;s pizza I ever had, was better than the other pizza&#39;s out there!

Even the frozen ones I buy and cook at home are better than a lot of other pizza places.  I even recently found out their thin crust pizza was pretty good too.  For 30 years I was so in love with the deep dish, I didn&#39;t even know there was a thin crust option... But my daughter can&#39;t handle deep dish yet, so we got her a thin crust, and it was great.

Thank You Lou&#39;s for being the all time greatest pizza out there!"

But Lou&#39;s is our top pick.  This location is carry out/delivery only, we&#39;ve done both at least 15-20 times over the last 6 months, and only once did the dough seem under-done.  We&#39;ve also visited their Schaumburg location (before the expansion).  Crazy busy.

Since we&#39;re trying to immerse ourselves in Chicago culture, what&#39;s more iconic than deep dish pizza, right?  So we hit all the popular ones:  Uno, Gino&#39;s, Rosati&#39;s, Giordano&#39;s, and a few others I can&#39;t remember now.

Conclusion:  Deep dish pizza - yummy.  Lou&#39;s was the best of the bunch.  The crust was perfectly crunchy, the dough had the best mouth-feel, the whole-pizza sausage patty well-seasoned, the cheese had wonderful texture, and the toppings are a good amount.  They store your order info under your phone #, so it&#39;s easy to tell them you want your usual - deluxe whole sausage, add pepperoni, butter crust, uncut.  Can&#39;t go wrong there.

Obviously we continue our journey into the land of deep dish pizza, but I&#39;m pretty confident Lou&#39;s remains at the top of the heap.

I&#39;d say I&#39;ve been there maybe 6 times in the last few years. A few times I was there the staff was apologizing profusely to a customer and offering a frozen pizza because they had forgotten the customer&#39;s order. Anyway, today I picked up a frozen Malnati&#39;s sausage pizza because once a week my boyfriend and I get takeout. I was really looking forward to the sinful delight... I read the directions on the top of the pizza that said to wipe down the pizza pan the pizza comes with. I wiped it down, and realized some kind of metal residue was left on my paper towel. I thought I was just maybe wiping some kind of burnt crust off or something, so wiped it down again, and then wiped the underside, and again there was some kind of metal residue on my paper towel. GROSS. I&#39;m not looking to ingest pizza pan.  Still, I decided to bake the pizza because the crust seemed unaffected. I baked the pizza in foil, removed it from the oven, and cut into it. I had picked up a sausage pizza, and after a few bites we realized it was a plain cheese, and only about half the pizza had cheese on it. The rest was just crust and tomato sauce. 

Totally disappointed. I&#39;m also wondering why there was a shiny metal residue on my paper towel when wiping down the tin pan the pizza came in. If that happens again, I will never eat Malnati&#39;s again. Totally unacceptable. If I could post pics here, I would post one to show you all."

Among my personal menu favorites are the milanesa torta, the steak burrito, the steak quesadillas, and the pork ribs with green salsa.  The house salsa is great, with just the right amount of heat, and the horchata is the best I&#39;ve ever had.

The only (small) criticisms I have of Mi Casa are that 1) the restroom can only be accessed from outside and has a door that is difficult to open, and 2) the service can be a bit slow if the restaurant is crowded.  All told, however, I consider this an excellent restaurant and highly recommend it."

A small side of salsa verde that cost $3.50 one day the next day they decide to raise the price to $4. It was already pricey for a small side of salsa verde but when it changes the very next day you learn a lot about how this business is run.

Probably not built with intent to have repeat customers.
No matter how well the food made was something like this makes me not want to go there again.
The salsa verde was good. And wouldn&#39;t have even mind one bit if the price was $5 if $5 was the price I paid the day before.


Also no receipt was offered even after I asked if they changed the price for the side of salsa verde let alone answering if their was a price change.

Eaten here before. And the food was pretty good even though preference for good Mexican food is always going to be to take a trek down to the south side of the city to Pulaski Ave. where you can never go wrong w/ quality, options, price, consistency, and atmosphere.

No other customers here so it can&#39;t be cuz they are overwhelmed. Sad.  Just sad. The one star is for the daughter who was verbally abused by her mother"

Horchata is a 5 star chata!!!

I ordered 2 al pastor tacos, a chilli rellano taco and a small Asada quesadilla.

Chips and salsa came out and it was gone in about a minute. It was soooo good! You could tell it was fresh, homemade salsa!

Al Pastor tacos were good, chili rellano was fresh out of the fryer and was a little too hot to handle. After my tastebuds cooled off I got into the Asada quesadilla and it was amazing!! 
Would love to come back and try it in a burrito.

Staff was very welcoming and made me feel right at home.

Can&#39;t wait to come back!"

She and I have been to more Mexican restaurants together than anyone else I know, and she&#39;s never led me astray. So as I drove up to an old Taco Bell building that had been re-painted and re-branded as Mi Casa, I was confused. Could Lauren have really missed a beat here? Was her streak of fantastic Mexican recommendations coming to an end?

As we walked inside and I looked around, I grew more suspicious. The menu is scrawled on whiteboard posters above the counter. The tables and chairs are undoubtedly from the Taco Bell they purchased. A tween girl stood at the counter waiting to take our order. I was pensive, to say the least. 

I perused the menu and found all of the standard delicious sounding items. I hadn&#39;t eaten yet that day and being that it was dinner, I was eager to sample a myriad of items from the menu to test this place out. I got the queso fundido, a chile relleno taco, and the enchiladas dinner (don&#39;t do this. It was way too much food and I nearly slipped into a food coma and moved into the restaurant permanently, living amongst retro plastic tables and chairs). My friend ordered her selections, and we chose a table.

The aforementioned tween (who was doing schoolwork between orders and made me feel really guilty about being there to eat) brought us water and chips and salsa while we waited for our food. Chips were bland, salsa was decent. Then my queso fundido arrived and my homegirl&#39;s guacamole and chips did, too. The fundido was deeeeeeelightful but honestly melting chihuahua cheese and serving it to a fat chick is not exactly brain surgery. I was still holding out to see how the rest of the menu stacked up.

I did not have to wait long. My chile relleno taco arrived and looked/smelled heavenly. The taco holds an ENTIRE chile relleno - a poblano peppers stuffed with enticing melty cheese and dipped in a breading, then subsequently deep fried. This chile relleno would have been amazing all alone, but topped with onion and and cilantro and wrapped into a steamy delicious corn tortilla?! Holy crap. HEAVEN. I&#39;m craving that damn taco again just writing about it. I shoulda ordered 3 of these and called it a day. The enchilada dinner was equally delicious - I got mine with green sauce (I can&#39;t do spice, I&#39;m weak), and tried each filling, all distinctive and tasty. I would happily enjoy a plate of these again except that I don&#39;t want to eat anything but chile relleno tacos for the rest of my life. OH and the prices are insanely affordable. Heaventacos, on the cheap?! Is this freakin paradise?!

So once again, my BFF didn&#39;t steer me wrong when it came to Mexican food. Seriously, look past the exterior of this place, the furnishings, etc. Look straight at that chile relleno taco. Gaze at it. Devour it. I promise you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Next were the tacos. The steak taco had a ton of flavor and piled in the taco with fresh cilantro and chopped onion. Then came the pork and chicken tacos.  The taste of these were also just as fabulous.  

They are served simple in a basket. The fillings are piled on two small corn tortillas.

My mother has a very sensitive stomach so a lot of foods make her feel sick. Generally, one does not consider Mexican food to be delicate, but she has found that she can enjoy the food at Mi Casa because it is so fresh and not at all greasy. This was our second time trying Mi Casa, I remember our first experience was very good as well. 
When we arrived we placed our order to the family up front at the counter (It appears that this place is literally run by one family, which I think is cute) and sat down. A young man brought us our beverages and some chips and salsa. The salsa is EXTREMELY fresh. You can taste all of the ingredients, it&#39;s absolutely fantastic. It tasted like it was just made a minute before we walked in! 
As far as our meals go, I ordered a steak burrito with cheese, steak, lettuce, tomato and avocado and my mom got a cheese quesadilla (it&#39;s very large.) Both my burrito and the quesadilla were fantastic. Like I said before, there was not a speck of grease to be seen. 
We weren&#39;t able to finish our food so one of the girls provided us with a box and we definitely scooped the rest of that salsa in there. 
Overall I would highly recommend Mi Casa due to its fresh, delicious food and welcoming family atmosphere. It is also very reasonably priced! It costs about as much as a usual Mexican taco stand, but I feel like the quality is significantly higher here. I will certainly be back!"

Dad on grill Mom on side and Daughter up front taking care of customers. Place was really clean and thats a big plus. My food was fresh and hot and seasoned just right.

It is good to see Wheaton have a place like this and not have given the building to a title loan store as so many former Taco bell structures have become. This structure hosts a family independent Mexican restaurant that is about as good as a place as you can find in Little Village in Chicago. The burrito was big and beefy not so smooched with lettuce as I requested. Great place in West burbs but the space is small and service a bit long.

Tacos were authentic (with cilantro and onion), doubled in size but a big O.K. Meat was not great. Rice and beans were good. Agua Horchata o.k. It all felt heavy. Chips were ok but table salsa was not good. It was bland but they probably cater to those that do not like or are used to spicy foods (NOT ME).

Bathroom is outside and in the back. Not good for those with small children though this is clearly run by a family. I&#39;m lucky I was there with a friend. 

In my early 20s after a drunken night this would have been a good spot. I hate to say it but I won&#39;t be returning."

They only offer tacos on soft corn tortillas, and they don&#39;t come with cheese-- only cilantro and oinons...but they&#39;re really great that way. I&#39;ve never actually eaten inside, so my review is based only on their food and the service of ordering and receiving it.

Hubby and I stopped here on a Saturday to check it out after my yelp buddy, Angus, gave it a great review.  I had the steak taco and the pastor taco as well as some pico de gallo with chips.  Hubby had the ribeye taco as well as the steak and pastor.  We weren&#39;t in the mood to share.

The pico de gallo was great!  I am a pico junkie.  I put it in eggs and have it with chicken.  It goes with everything and the chips are not exactly Weight Watcher friendly.  The chips are the restaurant type which are very tasty, but I have to watch it.

The tacos were fresh and very tasty.  The pastor one was ok, I think El Zarape does a better job with them.  They use corn tortillas and if you want extras like lettuce and cheese it cost extra.

You see, I&#39;ve been meaning to come here for the past few months, but for some reason, I never did. HUGE MISTAKE! As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is only accessible driving North on Main Street due to construction.

Anyways, this place occupies an old Taco Bell space. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, but it was nice to have the option (I live right around the block). My previous favorite taco restaurante, taco fresco has been closed for quite some time now. Yes, there are Chipotles and Qdobas in the area, but I wanted something more, and boy did I get it!

My brother and I met for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. I also work in the area, so I took my lunch break to get some tacos and quesadillas. After reading reviews and doing some research, we knew that everything was cooked to order and would take sometime. He put our orders in, and our food arrived in 10-15 minutes, right when I got off for my lunch.

We each had 3 tacos and a small quesadilla. All were made with fresh corn tortillas (by request).

I had a steak, chorizo, and pork taco, along with the Mi Casa Style (Adobo) chicken quesadilla. My brother had 2 pork items, as well as the ribeye taco. All the tacos were topped with cilantro and onions (authentic). The young boy (son of the owner) gave us two bottles of the homemade salsa (red; more bitter and green: sweeter and spicier in my opinion, and I also liked it more).

The tacos were excellent, especially the steak and chorizo ones. They did not even need any salsa with their flavors. I really enjoyed the chicken quesadilla with mini salad it came with (sour cream, tomato, and lettuce). I liked the pork, but I think I will get the Al Pastor next time.

The owner was extremely friendly and made sure we were taken care of. This is authentic Mexican food, and I&#39;m surprised to see the subpar reviews. I&#39;ve been tracking Mi Casa for a while, and it seems like the reviews have been getting progressively better. If you went to Mi Casa a while ago and weren&#39;t impressed, I highly suggested going back.

Our total for our 8 items was 18 dollars. We have big appetites, but I thought the price was very reasonable.

I&#39;d really like to see Mi Casa succeed. It looks like they cater, so if I have any type of event (doubtful for me), I would use them.

A family owned business that is doing MEXICAN food right! My favorite part of the visit, besides the amazing food? The owner telling us, &#34; Mi Casa es su Casa.&#34; Yeah, we all learned that phrase in Spanish 1, but contextually, it gave me chills. Can&#39;t wait to return!"

If I was in Mexico this place is what I would imagine a food stand/restaurant being. I keep on trying to find reasons to not give out five stars. Restaurants earn that from me.

&#34;Mi Casa es su casa&#34; was uttered as my twin brother and I left. It felt authentic, real, and genuine. Not as authentic as the tacos they&#39;re serving here! So delicious! First, a little back story.

The old Taco Bell that was here before is now gone. There are now only two Main St. restaurants on the north side. I am not counting Red Apple because that is in Carol Stream. So for those half days in high school...it was Smoke House or Taco Bell. I usually chose the former due to the latter being a chain, more people at Taco Bell, and not being as delicious.

Mi Casa has a menu including tacos, nachos, burritos, and tortas. They have dinner platters and even some breakfast options. They have bacon and avocado. if there I had a top five food list bacon and avocado make the grade. Don&#39;t forget pizza and pancakes though.

It truly is a family business. The son upfront took our order. Mom and dad were cooking in the back. Looks like Uncle Jorge runs the business side of things as he discusses with dad some money issues in Spanish. Daughter (and friend) arrive the same time our food does. 

Decided to order multiple tacos and a few quesadillas. All served on corn tortillas rather than flour (aka sugar). Pastor, steak, ribeye, chicken (Mi Casa style is an adobo marinade), chorizo, and a pastor and Mi Casa style chicken quesadilla. The quesadillas came with cheese, a side salad with some sour cream drizzled on top. I was going to try the lengua (tongue), but I chickened out. Next time.

If you are in a hurry, call ahead! I also recommend going at off peak hours.  No Esta  un bano (bathroom), drinks are bottled soda/water or Coke, Fanta, or Fuze Iced Tea. Rest in Peace Mountain Dew Code Red and Baja Blast.

This place is charming with three tables inside and outside. I feel like I am the Mexican countryside and I stopped for a nice cool Jarritos (even though I hate soda/pop). Dad came and check on us, talked to us, but also knew to give us our space.

I don&#39;t understand the two/three star reviews here. I guess it is all based on what you&#39;re looking for. I think many people neglect that GOOD FOOD TAKES TIME TO COOK. Slow down, take a deep breath, and just enjoy the atmosphere. You essentially are being welcomed in to this family&#39;s home for lunch or dinner.

If you have time to sit and eat, I suggest dining in. If you&#39;re in a hurry, don&#39;t want crappy Mexican food, and only have a few bucks...go to Mi Casa. I loved this place and will be back. I hope this place survives. Yes, I understand it isn&#39;t going to bring crowds in. But that&#39;s why i will be back. The people who eat (and work) here focus on quality over quantity. 

Just as the owner/dad said as we left &#34;Mi Casa es su casa&#34;. Come back anytime? Thanks!"

1-star service, cashier and ambiance. If you like indifferent service, and screaming and horseplay by the owner&#39;s / worker&#39;s young children while you try to eat- this is the place for you.

I ordered tacos to go. The place is what appears to be an old Taco Bell, it is nothing to look at and I do not recommend eating there, it was FREEZING inside. I ordered 4 tacos, 2 steak, one pork and one tongue, along with a rice and bean side order. I waited about 10 minutes for my order. I believe this is a family ran business, there were teenage kids helping out and I think they are the owners kids. I am all for supporting local businesses. I got my food and went home, I have to admit that I inhaled all 4 tacos! They were all absolutely delicious, full of flavor and very generous with their fillings. Their horchata was also good. They sent me home with two salsas, a green and red one. I tried both and they were also very good. One was spicer than the other but the flavor was on point. I will definitely be back for their tacos to go since my favorite place is too far from me now."

Visited on a Saturday evening since we love to try new places and wanted to give a shot. We first noticed that there were no prices listed anywhere until the young cashier handed us one. While we were waiting to be cashed out..I noticed that one of the workers dropped food on the floor. She made eye contact with me as she was picking it up and pretended that nothing happened and continued to serve it to someone. None the less, it was only a bag of chips but it makes you wonder..what else do they serve that comes in contact with the floor? 

We sat down after ordering and they brought out some chips with our drinks and we waited for a decent amount of time. When we finally thought they were coming out with our food..low and behold..they didn&#39;t have enough steak to fulfill the order. Normally, not that big of deal but I was already pretty disappointed and asked for my money back. 

Then! To top it all off, the girl who dropped food on the floor brought back the receipt from the refund. The girl was dripping with attitude and I do NOT tolerate bad customer service like that. I confronted her about dropping food on the floor and she denied it. Let&#39;s see how they react when Dupage health department stops by."

The Torta was good but the large Horchata was tiny too (about the size of a medium Mcdonalds cup)!Overpriced and small portions. No refills on chips or Horchata. Last time the Horchata machine was down. My brother had floaters in his water. The food tasted mediocre. The chips aren&#39;t fresh. I&#39;m still hungry.

For me, house hunting triggers cravings that come in waves. First, it was pancakes. Next, it was Dairy Queen&#39;s Butterscotch Dip Cone. Then, Mexican food.

Just down the street from the last house we looked at was Mi Casa. When we drove by it, on the way to the last house, my husband said it looked like a renovated Taco Bell. While I should have been looking at one of the half baths in the last house, I was actually looking at Yelp and discovered the good reviews, so we gave it a try.

When we walked in, it was clear that there were not enough tables. There were three tables inside what was the shell of a fast food place. The owner quickly greeted us and pulled two chairs up to the counter (where you would order at a McDonald&#39;s) and gave us menus. More people came in, so the owner and a server went outside to grab patio furniture for people to sit on.

Now, this probably should have been bad sign or a turn off or something else negative, but it was oddly charming. We had a perfect view into the kitchen where everything was prepared to order. A very fast working female chef kept things afloat as more and more people came in.

We ordered chorizo, marinated pork, and chicken tacos. To be blunt: every taco was fantastic. Really. Also, cheap. Well-priced, very good food is surprising to find sometimes and this restaurant surprised me. You should go, just not on a Sunday afternoon, unless you time it just right to get the &#34;chef&#39;s table&#34;."

My wife and I visited again last night. We decided to give it another try after our super picky sister-in-law visited and said it was good. She doesn&#39;t like anything normally. 

The place was really busy to my surprise. A good sign from the start. I also noticed that the place had a new front sign and the interior was upgraded since our original visits. They had a lot of people working which indicated to me that business was doing well.

The sister-in-law had recommended their steak tacos which the wife decided to partake in. The meat was surprisingly tender, the shell was authentic corn tortilla and she thought it was great! I tasted it and agreed.

I wanted to re-try what I had previously had to see if there was any improvement. There was. I had the chicken burrito. It was tender, juicy and very flavorful. The tortilla was grilled after the burrito was made for a nice finish. The chicken was shredded which I normally do no prefer. But this made the opportunity for the spices to penetrate the meat better and it worked. I did find the pricing to be just a little on the high side.

They also give you free chips and salsa while waiting for your carry out order. Nice touch.

I am happy to have another good place to eat nearby. This goes back on my list!"

After a pair of other yelpers implored me to revisit this establishment. One afternoon I decided to stop by again, this time with a taco on the agenda instead of the torta I purchased on my previous visit. I ordered one steak taco and one al pastor taco to go.

While I waited, service remained very friendly as mentioned on my previous visit and who I presume is the owner brought me out some chips and salsa to munch on while I waited for my tacos. The chips were good, the salsa had a strange taste to it, quite frankly it reminded me of the aftertaste left in your mouth after kissing a girl who smokes. I had a few chips and waited for my food to arrive. While waiting I snapped a picture of some particularly nasty construction outside that required me to basically go in a circle to actually reach the restaurant 

Once my food was ready I was out the door and on my way home. The big question here is how were the tacos? Well, they were pretty good, there was a definite emphasis on cilantro and that was a far more noticeable flavor than the meat on the taco. The meats were both tasty and the tortillo used for the taco was nice and soft. Overall the Taco was a significant improvement over the torta I had on my first visit.

Overall I was impressed enough with the taco to upgrade Mi Casa by one star to three stars. I&#39;d recommend the tacos, but would advise to stay away from the torta or the salsa that comes with the chips. Service here is very friendly and I would stop again but it&#39;s not exactly my favorite Mexican restaurant either."

They took out drinks order and it took forever to get me a cup of iced and never offered sugar or even had any on the table. All the servers had an attitude.
They brought us a ting bowl of chip and a microscopic salsa bowl to dip; it tasted old and like it came out of a can.
The food was horrible like everything else, we ordered the chicken and beef fajitas, the the food had no taste what so ever, the beef was very chewy and the chicken was over cooked, supposedly it came with grilled vegetables that was still raw. We had to ask for our plates and silver wear because they never brought us any, the servers just dumped the plates on the tables and walked away.
And we had to get up to get sour cream, because they never tended our table.

Between the two of us, we had the green sauce enchiladas (was told by the cashier not to try the red as it was super hot and my hubby likes hot but still), the quesadilla, the beef taco, the tamale and the refried beans.  We tried everything except the tamale and it was all really good.  The tacos were fantastic.  The cheese quesadilla was really good with a nice outer crunch.  My hubby loved the enchiladas.  All of the ingredients tasted fresh.  We just had cokes so I can&#39;t comment on their drinks.

The free chips and salsa are some of the best I&#39;ve had and not too hot. I&#39;m a wimp when it comes to not wanting things spicy and I was able to eat quite a bit of the salsa. They give you a very small dish of salsa and a small bowl of freshly made chips.  I did not share much... :-) 

The atmosphere inside was very basic and it was kind of cold (cold outside, cold inside) but clean and nice enough for an inexpensive date. It is inside and old Taco Bell.  There was a gentleman who was constantly wiping up the tables.  However, service was very slow, the only real negative. It just gave me more time to eat more chips!!

The menu is listed up on white boards above the registers, but no prices. There are menus by the cashier which has prices and a more detailed description of the food. You order at the register and then have a seat. A couple of teenagers delivered our food to us. (there is a tip jar by the counter) They do take credit cards, but a minimum of $10.  

This restaurant has made it to the top of our favorite Mexican restaurants in the area. There was another new Mexican restaurant which opened in the last year or so in the Lombard area and was much fancier inside.  I would rather go to Mi Casa over that restaurant any day."

They&#39;re a family run service, which I generally give bonus points for-it keeps the atmosphere cozy. I&#39;ve gone here a couple of times and their burritos, tacos, and guac are all great. The salsa is actually salsa (chunky and spunky pico de gallo) and they use corn tortillas for their tacos (sorry midwest, but if you&#39;ve ever been to California you&#39;ll realize that corn tortillas are the way to go for tacos). In all, great family restaurant that serves quality Mexican food (for the Midwest) and you&#39;ll leave a happy and satisfied customer!"

I was very pleased to confirm the positive experience related by others. I had the Enchlada dinner and my girls had kids quesadillas. The staff was very friendly and even though it was shortly before closing,  the place was clean and welcoming. We got some tortilla chips and salsa while we waited for our food which came promptly. The portions were reasonable and the food tasted excellent. 
I will definitely be coming back to try more of their menu. This is a nice hidden gem in north Wheaton. I would definitely recommend this place over El Zaramba or Front Street Cocina.  Only downside is that they do not have a liquor license,  so no margartitas ;)"

It is like being served by your family and we really enjoyed eating in. Everybody was really nice - they brought our food to us - and cleaned up and you could tell they were just happy to serve us delicious food.

We tried the horchata, it was really yummy and they give free refills and at 1.50 a glass we will get two next time. Next we each had a steak taco and an al pastor taco I though the meat was super flavorful - both were served mexican style with onion and cilantro, which is my preference. Then they brought out salsa&#39;s in squeeze bottles and it took the tacos to the next level - one of them is sort of dark looking and is smoky/spicy - try it!

Then we had a quesadilla with poblano peppers... I have never had a quesadilla made with grilled poblanos before and it might have been my favorite quesadilla ever (especially with the salsa mentioned above and/or the pico they put on the plate). 

For us the service was well paced but some of our friends think they are slow - we will see how it plays out over time but we were happy to relax while our delicious food was made."

They were definitely not busy when we were there - two people were finishing their meal...and the rest of the place was empty.  We ordered a steak burrito, chile relleno burrito and an al pastor torta. We added avocado to each burrito and were charge $1.29  extra for each. They did give us a small bowl of salsa &amp; chips while we waited. 

The cook was terribly slow. I watched him put the frozen chille rellenos on the grill to heat up first. After about 5 minutes he flipped them over, added water to create steam under a lid. He then started on the steak burrito...which surprisingly was done quite quickly. He added the 2 - 3 slices of avocado, rolled it up and put it back on the flat top to heat thru. Now he came back to the chile relleno...which by now was burnt.  He left the tortilla on the grill - removed the chile relleno and threw half of it out in the garbage (the black parts). I saw him throw it thru the air to the garbage can on the other wall. He proceeded to chop what was left and used that for my burrito.  

Ok...accidents can happen...but wouldn&#39;t anyone think he should have made me a new one???? So my burrito ended up being the bigger one...but too bad for me, it was filled with lettuce. I had some chopped chile relleno at both ends and plenty of lettuce in the center. On the bright side, I did  have 2 slices of avocado in it for that additional $1.29.

The torta was very bland and filled with a ton of lettuce. No real flavor. Obviously, the &#34;al pastor&#34; was just cooked pork - not the traditional marinated, roasted pork. I saw him take some from a pot and then scrape some from another plate...made it look like leftovers from another order. Bun was toasted, but they forgot to cut it in half, making it difficult to eat without spilling out most of the lettuce. The steak in the burrito was very fine...almost like ground beef.  The cook could have seasoned the meat  to give it some flavor.

All in all, will probably never go back....sort of decided that when I watched my chile relleno fly into the garbage."

With that in mind, i&#39;ll elaborate about the good things! 

There are three things all food places should have: a clean environment, friendly service, and delicious food. Mi Casa nails all three. 
 
Get the tacos el pastor.  They&#39;re well made (e.g. the corn tortillas stay in tact while you&#39;re eating them and the portions are decent) and  they have sensational flavor. The food isn&#39;t overly greasy and I actually feel like I&#39;m eating something healthy, home-made and unprocessed. 

Also, this is clearly family owned and operated. I love that. These people genuinely care about the food they&#39;re making and serving and they make it clear that they appreciate your business. It&#39;s a shame more places can&#39;t be this candid, instead of corporate. 

I noticed some people complained about a lack of seating, bathrooms, and alcohol. Um.... it&#39;s a take out place, what do you expect? All take-out places have a small amount of seating for those that are waiting, or want to grab a fast lunch, this is typical. Also, the fact that it&#39;s an old Taco Bell has NO bearing on the quality and taste of the food. If you get bogged down in superficial details, I feel sorry that you&#39;re missing out on excellent, authentic cuisine. 
 Little Caesars doesn&#39;t have beer, does that bother you, too? I don&#39;t know about everyone else, but if I plan to have drinks, it&#39;s not on the run in a little take-out place. 

Liquor licenses are expensive, and carry liability. Just let these people make delicious food for you and quit knit-picking! It&#39;s very good. Try it out!"

Also (we found this to be a plus), they are rarely crowded.  A hidden gem!  Kitchen open later than almost all other places in the area (another BIG plus).

A coworker and I stopped by for a fairly late dinner the other night, we each had an entr√©e and shared the  firecracker shrimp appetizer. The appetizer was delicious but could&#39;ve been presented better. It was just thrown on the plate over top of some reasons it could&#39;ve been presented in a more appetizing way.

For the entr√©es we each had fish - one had Salmon the other had some sort of whitefish, I forget which one it was. Best part of the plate was the vegetables which were perfectly cooked and seasoned, probably a different cook from the one who did the main dishes. Side of mac &amp; cheese was very good but needed the saltshaker. Both pieces of fish were slightly overcooked, not seasons and did not taste very fresh.

Yelpers gave this place an average of three stars and they were right. Not lousy but far from delicious."

I&#39;d rather have bread and water than a huge sandwich marbled in fat.  Which is why I&#39;m usually disappointed when I order pulled pork at a restaurant, even proud barbeque places that brag their meats are &#39;slow cooked in a smoker all day&#39; (like JD&#39;s Q &amp; Brew or the Rack House) .  So I was encouraged when I went to a neighborhood &#39;Taste of&#39; festival and tried Birch River Grill&#39;s pulled porch.  It was tender, tasteful and not a trace of fat.  But I&#39;ve been surprised before by restaurants that deliver a great meal once, but can&#39;t do it consistently and I end up being disappointed the next time I try the same dish I enjoyed previously.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH BIRCH RIVER GRILL.  I took a chance and had lunch there today and pressed my luck by once again trying their pulled pork sandwich.  Honestly, it was even better than at the festival.  It had a tasty coleslaw and onion strings on top and came with their own baked potato chips.  I will return again for their pulled pork and hope that I&#39;ve finally found a place I can consistently get this favorite treat.  (One side note.  The guy I was with got the reuben, and he said it was very delicious, but he was disappointed there wasn&#39;t more meat on it.  He is however a guy who enjoys HUGE sandwiches for lunch like double bacon cheese burgers.  So from his perspective, there probably wasn&#39;t enough meat on his reuben. I know I couldn&#39;t finish all of my meal because of the portions.)"

When I entered the restaurant for dinner, there was no one to great me and no signs telling me where to sit. So I walked around looking for a seat, when I found a server and asked her where to sit, she told me anywhere. After I sat down I was provided water and bread rather quickly. While the bread was a nice touch, it wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. After a rather noticeable wait, my waitress finally came and I gave her my order. While she wasn&#39;t mean or anything, she had no personality and was trying to hurry me thru my order. Anyway, after a minute or two, the bus boy who brought the bread returned and gave me my iced tea. I then went to eating bread and drinking iced tea until.....the bread was gone and the iced tea was gone. Usually this wouldn&#39;t be a problem, however for this restaurant, it was because noone came to refill it. While I waited for a refill I saw other waiters go to other tables but noone came to check on me until I finally flagged down a bus boy for a refill. He pleasantly complied and refilled my tea and water. After a noticeable wait,  my meal arrived (again, served by the bus boy, not the waitress). I ordered the black and blue salad for $14. Reading the description and seeing the price, I thought it would be a great salad, however when I got it I was rather disappointed, it was small, the meat was lukewarm and the onions were inseparable. Anyway, hungry as I was, I ate the salad all by myself, without anyone saying hi, filling up my drink or just stopping by to check on me. When I finished my salad, I looked around ready for the check, however noone came. So I pulled out my phone and started to write my yelp review, while I&#39;m typing the bus buy finally comes and clears my table, however I still haven&#39;t gotten my check from the watiress, so more then 10 minutes after finishing my meal, I ask the busboy for the waitress and he fetches her. When she finally arrived I asked her for the check and she returned rather quickly with it. Thinking she would be right back, I placed my credit card in the check and left it at the edge of the table for her to see. Then I waited....waited....waited.....until she finally returned.....10 minutes after she gave me the check. Not wanting to make this meal any longer then it should be, I signed the bill and left.

Overall, I don&#39;t know why this restaurant is even paying for this waitress, the bus boys helped me more then she ever did and based on the service I received, they would be a better waiter then she is as a server. She was very inattentive and unreachable, if the restaurant would have been busy I would have understood but it was NOT busy and they had staff just sitting around. (with that said, I did notice that another table with another waiter appeared to have good service, however my table and another table who had the same waitress both had bad service!)

For tomorrow&#39;s dinner, you can bet I&#39;m going to take that 1/4 mile walk in the rain to another restaurant, because being soaking wet and cold is way better then being captive in a restaurant and wasting $20 wishing you went somewhere else."

Brian W. has it spot on, that feeling of mediocrity and the wishing to escape. I came here on my own initiative and must say I wonder why. Maybe because it is convenient and there do not seem to be other bars around.

The greasy hair waiter is a Hubbard-Street-lounge-wanna-be and doesn&#39;t belong here. He is more interested in shmoozing with the other waitress or just not give a shit about serving customers. Service is mediocre and the beer selection is pretty lame too.

It was close to 9pm on a Thursday, and we wanted to try something new, so we headed over to BRG to use a Groupon.    Upon arrival, we saw a sign to walk up to the bar to be seated.  The restaurant is big, but there were only 3 tables occupied, and two of those were 1 tops.  

We were seated and offered menus by Gina, the only server on staff (there was still a bartender and bus boy).  We were brought water and bread by the bus boy, but we had to flag down Gina after waiting 20 minutes to place our order.  She was either chatting with the bartender and busboy (who we could clearly see across the room), or hiding in the kitchen.  She doesn&#39;t refill our water or even deliver our food.  What in the world is she there for? 

The food arrives (by bus boy, of course).  My husband ordered the Grilled Marinated Skirt Steak, which he found tasty, albeit his grilled onions had a terrible texture and were impossible to cut and eat.  I ordered the Chervil crusted Pike.  DO NOT ORDER THIS DISH.  It was terrible!  I was given two very greasy, overly deep fried pieces of fish.  I immediately regretted my order, but given the terrible service so far, I didn&#39;t risk the chance of saying something about it. 

Gina never came to check on us anyway.  Finally when we were done with our meal, and the bus boy cleared our plates, we waited around another 15 mins before she came by and offered dessert.  She returned with dessert menus, and then disappeared again. It was going on 10 mins that we were waiting AGAIN, and then my husband finally walked up to the bar area where she was again chatting with the busboy and bartender.  

We placed our dessert order to go.  As we were walking out, the bartender looked right at us, but didn&#39;t say &#34;Have a good night&#34; or anything like that.  Tell me, if your establishment is looking to increase its business by Groupon deals, don&#39;t you want to make sure you treat all your customers right so they come back?  

Although there were a couple things that sounded interesting on the menu, due to this experience, we will never return."

All three times, I had the Cobb salad. Because it really, truly, is a beautiful thing. Very generous with all key ingredients - bacon, grilled chicken, and avocado, Perfect in every way. 

For my 2nd visit, prior to the Cobb, I was feeling adventurous and ordered the Wild Game chili. Bison, wild boar, and andouille sausage. Piping hot and just effin&#39; delicious. Was too full to even think about asking for their signature $10 carrot cake. 

It was on my 3rd visit - FINALLY - that I was able to order the carrot cake and even begrudgingly shared it with my pal. Okay, actually, I was kinda full from the Cobb salad and they just so happened to move faster with a fork than I was able to. 

Oh. My. Gosh. It was three layers and round like a mini birthday cake and just TOO CUTE. And still plenty to take home for those midnight munchies. Was it spectacular? Eh, it was good but just carrot cake, after all. But the presentation was delightful and YES it is worth 10 whole smackers to plunk down for it.


Sure, service has been a little slow considering I have never been there when it was actually busy. And I&#39;ve had to flag someone down for a water or iced tea refill on each visit. These things don&#39;t bother me when the food is good, though. And maybe I just happened to stumble on the ONE dish (the wonderful Cobb salad) that they perfected and consistently deliver on, and if that&#39;s the case, fine. I don&#39;t plan on deviating from what has made me very happy three times in a row."

I really enjoyed the upscale lodge feel to the dinning room. The dinning room was nice and open with plenty of space between tables. Our waitress was very friendly as well. The burger here was very good. I really enjoyed the pretzel roll and it was cooked perfectly. All and all a nice meal.

Reservation was for seven, called to change it to six, had requested a round table. Arrived on time, was seated next to the round table requested at a table set for eight. 

Food was disappointing. Have been here many times and food was great. Not so much this time. Broasted chicken was dry. Pork tenderloin had half dried out and half juicy. Service was nonexistent, but they added the gratuity in!

Happy to leave and it will be a while before we try again. Certainly not willing to risk friends here again till they figure out what they are doing."

Having dined there on a Thursday night, the place was not busy at all. Decor is not the greatest but it&#39;s not a looking place either. It had more of a ski resort/cabin feel to it more than a hotel restaurant. 
Service was...strange. The guy who seated us was kind enough to take our drink order. A few minutes later our server shows up asking for our drink order. When we told her the young man already took our order she looked surprised and confused. 
The menu was small and again...strange. They had bison, duck and other not-so-ordinary meats on the menu. 
The bread they brought out to the table was stale.
Our table ordered the fried calamari; it must have been re-fried several times because all we could taste was the oil. 
Bison chili was brought out...cold. Beans were uncooked too.
The most simple (and safe) dish in my opinion was the mac n&#39; cheese with chicken. Ummm, how do I put this in a polite way? It was...not savory or flavorful. Actually, I had to add salt and pepper to give it a little flavor. And I never like to add salt to my food. 
Just not a good experience. Wish we never went there. Waste of money."

I came to this appropriately-decorated hotel restaurant hoping for a spin at the 5-star promise of delicious food at a wonderful place, as sold by other reviewers. I truly wish my experience had been anywhere closer to theirs. Instead I got a slim menu, with interesting choices albeit poorly executed, priced at best-of-Chicago seafood level, delivered via mind-bottling slow, uncommitted service.

Perhaps Thursday night is not their night. I, however, got the impression that this mediocre hotel restaurant is putting its best effort forward to remain simply that. Someone should tell their marketing people to stop bothering with deals and promotions.

On the plus side, the older crowd sitting at the bar seemed to be having an okay time; and, a couple of tables across, the chatty tipsy traveler that monopolized our waitress&#39;s time probably left thinking he received great service. So, if you are looking to share drinks with half-a-dozen traveling strangers, or perhaps chat up a procrastinating staffer in a hotel-lobby setting, do visit around dinner time!"

I started going to RBG 3 years ago, when my mom, hubby, and I decided to find a place for Thanksgiving. Yes, we are one of those lazy people that have people cook for us just to avoid the hassle :)

I was incredibly impressed when I walked in. The place is huge, well lit, modern but not overwhelming. It had a Eastern European/Finnish feel to it, with river and birch themed decor (shocka!). I love birches, and large birch tree branches in the main hall were a beautiful addition to the ambiance. The meals were to die for, especially a summer squash soup. I am drooling as we speak, thinking about its rich creamy texture and a sweet/ spicy flavor. The meal is huge, with a complimentary sour dough bread basket in the beginning. 

The wait staff was extremely nice and prompt, and there were barely people in there. Which is pretty typical for that place. 

Overall, love it, love it, love it.  Needless to say, I have been there plenty of times since then."

We had no expectations, but were pleasantly surprised by the dining room&#39;s decor, food selection, and taste of everything. Since this restaurant is in a hotel, we were a little nervous about crowding, but our fears were for nothing. It was nearly empty. 

We sat in a very comfortable booth, and the friendly wait staff explained where everything was, and offered us drinks. 

Due to extreme eating, we did not last long, nor did we get to try the lunch items. Too full on the breakfast stuff! 

I did manage to eat a delicious slice of peanut butter pie (from the beautiful dessert table) after all of that. It was great while it was happening, but I paid dearly with a classic stuffed turkey feeling.

On the plus side:
1.  The food was good.  Definitely give the chili a whirl.  Lots of fixin&#39;s come with it, making it a step above the rest.
2. The decor is fabulous - so unlike the neighborhood (in a positive way).
3. My glass was never empty.  This is a huge plus!

On the negative:
1. Our meal won the award for the slowest lunch ever!  And this wasn&#39;t because they were super busy and our waiter was frazzled.  No - we were one of three tables in the entire restaurant!  Regardless, it took 20 minutes for the appetizer, another 15 after we finished the appetizer for my husband to get his soup, and then we had to wait again for our entrees.  It just dragged on and on and on.  
2. It was a touch on the high side for lunch.  I think their menu prices may be the same all day long.  Regardless, a $10 sandwich, had better be a mighty fine sandwich!

All in all, the food was good.  It just wasn&#39;t worth the time it took to prepare it, nor the price."

I had the pork tenderloin--it was outstanding.  My friend had the skirt steak and said it was great, and we&#39;ll definitely come back again.  The presentation of the food is wonderful.  I actually took pictures of our plates because they were so beautiful.  The salad was fresh, and both of our meats were cooked to perfection.  My mashed sweet potatoes were tasty, as was the cauliflower.  And the bread is to die for!!

I personally like the ambiance at the Birch River Grill.  It has an understated elegance, as does the food.  It&#39;s elegant, but you feel comfortable going there in your jeans, because that&#39;s what the waitstaff wears.  Prices are reasonable for what you get.

Don&#39;t be fooled by it being part of a hotel.  I&#39;ve traveled around the country on business trips and wish I would have had a place like this when I traveled.  It&#39;s a very comfortable place to dine, reasonably priced, and the food is great--we&#39;ve never been disappointed."

With that being said we went there for dinner with out any expectations. As we walked in I remember thinking the decor was great although a little confusing since it had a modern appeal until I stumbled upon the mounted deer head. After walking into the place and seeing the setting I instantly thought the meal would be great. However, I left thinking they should have put less time in decorating the place and more time into perfecting the menu, which by the way is over priced for the food they serve. Our group of five ordered turkey pot pie, chervil crusted northern pike, rib-eye, meatloaf and black and blue salad. The only meal that was good was the black and blue salad. The turkey pot pie crust was unfinished and somewhat slimy. The perch which I assumed would be pan seared tasted deep fried and was very greasy, but the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese was great. I never tried the rib-eye and to be honest I am not a steak person, but it seemed fatty and tough. 

They service was great, but not enough to mask the terrible food."

We arrived at 10:30am, and were told that after 10am, they only have the buffet  on Sunday.  They had a very limited selection:  Two kinds of scrambled eggs, hash brown potatoes, pancakes, bacon, and sausage links, some cold cereals, oatmeal, 2 kinds of melon cubes, pineapple cubes, cottage cheese,  some yogurts, 2 kinds of stale sweet rolls, and some bread for toasting.  They had grapefruit juice and cranberry juice in dispensers.  They were room temperature, and there was no ice to add. The eggs were cold, potatoes were hard.  The rest was just OK.  We were charged $15.00 per person for the buffet, would have been $10.95 each if we had just stayed where we were.   To top it off, we usually tip $2.00 per person at a buffet, but we were charged 18% automatically for using the Restaurant.com coupon.  Overall  bad experience.

Vini&#39;s did a great job of meeting my thin crust pizza desires.  A very zesty and quite delicious pizza which was at a near perfect thin crust thickness (when you are looking for a thin crust pizza).  My only major gripe with them is in terms of pricing, and that is why they did not get a five star rating.  I would probably be okay with there prices if it was a nice dine in location where I was getting served, but in terms of a delivery/take out place, the prices are a bit out of wack in my honest opinion.

We ordered a 20in Pepperoni pizza at 6:09 pm. We were then promised a delivery time of 45 minutes or less, which is about average for the area.

Unfortunately, that time came and went. We decided to call at 7:10 pm to ask for a status update on our order. The employee on the line stated that the order had been dispatched earlier and should arrive any second. Completely understandable for a busy Sunday night.

The wait continued... No sign of the driver for another 45 minutes. Once again, we decide to check for a status update at 7:55 pm. We were told that the order had been dispatched and should arrive any moment. 

Deja Vu anyone?!?

Pizza finally arrived at 8:00 pm. The delivery driver issued no explanation or apology of any sort. We finally had our pizza at least...

I wish the disappointment ended with the service, but unfortunately it continued with the food... Our pizza was delivered at room temperature, maybe slightly colder than that. The flavor showed alot of potential, but it was simply too hard to judge this pizza due to the temperature it was delivered at...

The silver lining that saved Vini&#39;s from a 1 star review was the $10.00 credit that was offered for our next purchase. Unfortunately, that is a bit on the weak side as far as discounts go, considering I had to fork over $35.00 plus tip for this experience.

I am an understanding man and thus will give Vini&#39;s Pizza one more chance to wow me. 

Maybe a slow weeknight will allow them enough of a chance to get their act together long enough for me to finally grant them a fair judgement...

I&#39;m not a fan of deep dish so I was looking for a thin crust with lots of cheese (I am from WI, after all). This did not disappoint. The cheese was ample and I don&#39;t think they could possibly put any more toppings on the pizza. 

My only gripe here is the cost-it&#39;s a bit pricey. I ordered a 12 inch, 1/2 Vini&#39;s house special and 1/2 Vini&#39;s deluxe. I&#39;m from out of town so I wanted to try both since they sounded so good. The price listed on the website for either of these as a 12 inch pizza is $21.80. Which in itself seemed expensive, but hey, it&#39;s on the company&#39;s dime. When I went to pick up the pizza, the total (including a bottle of water) came to just under $30.00. Seemed a bit steep, but the pizza was wonderful. I suppose it was worth it given the copious amounts of toppings."

Our first pizza order for delivery was their Bubba Beef Pizza and an order of chicken wings. Both were absolutely delicious. Nice big wings, not little tiny ones like B-Dubs. Order arrived quickly and the driver was friendly and courteous!

Our second delivery order was a Bruschetta Pizza and a Meat Lovers Pizza with another order of wings. Both of these pizza&#39;s were awesome! Again, quick delivery from a friendly driver.

It looks like we&#39;ve finally found our &#34;regular&#34; pizza shop!"

Note: Vini&#39;s uses raw fresh jalapenos on its pies, which can make for a pretty hot slice. I recommend an extra-large slicer and enjoying the leftovers for breakfast."

I will definitely get the lasagna again! The ribs were also very good. Good amount of sauce, and fell off the bone. 

A week later we came in for the largest supreme pizza. The crust is so cripsy yet fluffy and the ingredients combo was great. Definitely one of the best thin crust pizzas. 

Service the second time around wasn&#39;t so good though. We placed our order a half hour ahead, and when we came in they said it&#39;d be right out. &#34;Right out&#34; turned into 10 minutes, then another 15 minutes, then another 10 minutes.... aka they forgot to start our pizza and we waited an extra 30 minutes. They didn&#39;t admit it or apologize. That&#39;s poor customer service for sure, but I will be nice and cut them some slack and come back again.

The biggest drawback is that they don&#39;t have anyplace to sit inside and outside it is just some plastic lawn chairs.  Regardless, I recommend it as the slices are big and so is the soda."

The first pizza arrived with wrong toppings and all the cheese and toppings had slid to one side. It looked like they were playing frizbee with it. The garlic bread was burnt to a crisp also. We complained and they sent another pizza. Pizza arrived with a gallon of grease on top... it was a soupy droopy slobbery disgusting mess.

I go here a lot. I stockpile $1 bills specifically for this purpose. I think at the bank they believe I visit a lot of strippers, but I smell like sauce not perfume. I tell my wife I&#39;m going to Home Depot to get parts to fix things, but I really go to vinis, then eat the slice in the garage while I pretend to work.

One time she walked into the garage when my mouth was full. I quickly turned my back and held a sanding block to my ear, pretending to be on the phone.

The one negative that doesn&#39;t get much press here a lot is the high cost of extras on pizza, things like oh toppings...

  As a pizza place, I would say they get the food right, it&#39;s good pizza, no argument.  Is it anything special?  I would argue not really, it&#39;s competent but nothing standout about it, crisp crust and melty cheese with what seemed to be quality toppings.  Taste was good but again, not one of those &#34;how do they do it?!&#34; flavors.

  The thing that bugs the heck out of me about Vini&#39;s is that my pizza cost $38, yes THIRTY-EIGHT dollars for a 3 topping pizza.  I have never in my life paid that much for pizza.  $3 (minimum) per topping is a little high, IMO.  Looking at the menu, I thought, &#34;hmm, $23 bucks is about the going price for a pizza this size, no biggie.&#34; and then as I&#39;m hanging up the phone I have a hallucination that the cashier just quoted me a number somewhere around $40 for a thin disc of bread and cheese with a couple vegetables on it.

  I get it, quality costs extra, and I completely respect that.  However, I&#39;ve seen truly gourmet pizzas with truffle oil go for less in downtown Chicago, and this is not LaMadia Pizza.  I think I will continue to frequent Nino&#39;s, who&#39;s pizza is just as good if not better for about $15 (that&#39;s a 3d IMAX movie folks) less.  Lucky for Vini&#39;s they&#39;re pretty much in a different delivery area."

Over the past two years I have gradually tried almost all of the pizza joints in Palatine and the majority of the restaurants. Vini&#39;s pizza would be #1 on my list for thin crust pizza and #2 on my list of best food in Palatine (see my review of Capri Deli for #1).

Vini&#39;s Pizza offers the full arsenal of your average pizza parlor with a selection of appetizers you find at a lot of them. The mushrooms, in particular, are a crowd pleaser.

I&#39;m aware that most people are going to tell you to go to Lou Malnatis, but for thin crust it is almost always delivered underdone. If you really want a tasty thin crust hit up Vini&#39;s. The price is a touch higher than most of the pizza places in Palatine, but it is well worth it.

Since Vini&#39;s is close to our home and we pass it pretty often we thought we would give it a shot.  When I called to place our order the gentleman on the phone was very friendly and helpful.  When I explained that this was our first time trying Vini&#39;s he recommended asking the cashier to use the coupons on the box towards this purchase.  When we picked up our pizza we did exactly what he suggested and the cashier was more than happy to do so.  

We decided to try their 16&#34; regular crust with pepperoni, sausage and anchovies (just on one side as I am not an anchovy lover).  Their regular crust is a thin crust which is not usually my first choice in terms of pizza crust.  I gravitate towards a thicker crust although I have to admit that Vini&#39;s was very flavorful and I actually didn&#39;t miss the extra dough.  All the ingredients were very good including the sausage and cheese.  The thick layer of cheese on our pizza really made it stand out from the other ingredients.

Their jumbo slices and liter of pop are filling, delicious, and really hit the spot and only cost $4 of $4.50 for the special slice.  The layers of toppings on a special slice probably cost Vini&#39;s more than the extra .50, so it&#39;s a great deal for customers if you like jalapenos, pepperoni, sausage, and bacon on your pizza.  Try the pizzarito.  It&#39;s multiple-times better than the best calzone you&#39;ve ever had.  Beefarito is like taking the pizzarito and mixing it with a savory Italian beef sandwich. Also, Vini&#39;s pasta, wings, and salads are delicious.  Their salads are pretty healthy.  Try their Caesar dressing...it&#39;s fantastic!  I&#39;ll recommend my favorite specialty pizza: the Caesar Thin-Crust. 

Aside from the food, the service is great, too.  The employees work hard and know their trade.  The owners are especially nice and friendly.

At its best this pizza is 5 stars. Lack of consistency knocks it down some and it&#39;s a bit pricey. Take out on Friday always seems to be better than takeout on Saturday.

I&#39;m sure they left out the coupon but even $36 is really steep for what we ordered.  The pizza would have to be something phenomenal to charge that much, but it wasn&#39;t, it was alright when it arrived but got soggy after a short time.

We ordered a four topping extra large thin crust pizza and one order of jalapeno poppers for delivery.  The total not including tip was $48.11.  

When the delivery guy told me the price I thought he had the wrong order.  When I inquired about the price he told me that it was his first day delivering for Vini&#39;s and he had already asked the staff twice if they had the right price on several of the pizza&#39;s they gave him because the receipts were so expensive.  He was worried no one was going to tip him because of the prices.  I gave the guy $5 because it&#39;s not his fault.

They also forgot to print out a credit card receipt even though I gave them all of my credit card information over the phone.  The delivery guy had to call and they told him they&#39;d call him back cause they were busy.   I just ended up writing my credit card number on the back of the receipt after five minutes of waiting for them to call back which they didn&#39;t.

The pizza had a great crust and a big taste, and just the slice by itself filled me up for lunch.  Plus the fact that they give you a liter of pop is a great deal.  That&#39;s way more pop than I can even drink, so it lasted me two days.  I will be back, especially since the service is so fast and I have limited lunch time."

lunch special is a good deal, 4.00 buys you a nice slice of pizza and a huge bottle of pop or water 
lunch i think is considered 11-4; a real deal if your on a budget

pasta was not so great - good price but the quality is not

Garlic bread was really awsome, grilled chicken salad was guge for a small

my thought stay with the pizza - avoid the pasta

take out or delivery only"

Venutis was recommended to me for our Wedding Venue by my coworker so my husband and I went to check it out and absolutely fell in love with it. 
The venue is simply gorgeous! and I am pretty sure some of our guests jaws dropped when they walked in :) Love It! 
Planning a wedding is not easy but first Patrick (no longer works there) and then Karen were amazing at helping us with everything and they made the process really smooth. 
I met with Karen multiple times as well as we did multiple tastings at free of charge to make sure our wedding was perfect. And it was! Couldn&#39;t have imagined it better :) I am sooo thrilled with how everything turned out. 
Food was phenomenal at tasting and during our wedding! 
Staff was very helpful and nice, and I have zero complaints. 
yahh i was surprised I had to get my own shot glasses for the bottles of vodka we were providing (Polish Wedding) but in the end it doesn&#39;t matter. Venutis was outstanding and I will recommend this place to everyone.
Thank you thank you thank you for everything. I wish I could relive this moment again.  Venuits helped make our day the best day ever. 
-very very happy bride :)

venutis-addison,Natalia R.,ahD_uD58RptR_sfZkkda5A,"Logan Square, Chicago, IL",0,1,0,4,37,R3fTqhQU5lZAbOvjAhfiBQ,2.0,2016-11-21,"This review is based on more than one occasion of visiting Venutis since I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s always fair to write a review based on one experience. But our last outing there on Sunday topped it off for me to want to write a review and finalize this as the last time we will be bringing business there.

The event on Sunday was my birthday and the meeting of our family with our first born son. I want to also preface this review with the fact we have had our family do various brunches at Venutis because of special events and the beautiful decor of the restaurant (the main reason I didn&#39;t give them only 1 star... the interior decor helps them out. Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t cover up poor customer service or rudeness). 

Before I spit fire I also want to say there was one amazing and helpful woman who was the hostess, so this is not targeted at her.

But on we go... if you&#39;re not a family/friend of the owners/whoever runs the show at the front, or if you&#39;re not Italian... you&#39;ll probably get the impression that they want your money quickly and for you to leave quickly to turn it over to the next paying customer. I mean who cares if your customers are staying longer because they&#39;re having a good time enjoying each other&#39;s company in a pretty venue right? As long as they get the f*** out of there so you can get more hot little cash in your hand. I mean customer satisfaction is over rated in America right? So what does one do to get their customers out the door and on to the next? Well for starters being rude to the guests of your party by telling them to move out of the way in not so polite of a manner, at the very BEGINNING of your event. Then the venue decides when is an appropriate time to bring out the cake for your family members while the rest of the group and especially person of honor are not ready yet (despite the venue clearly stating to &#34;let them know when you&#39;re ready&#34;. And this is especially rude when your guest of honor is attending to her baby and has to be rushed back to the room because the venue decided it was time for cake). Then you can top it off by taking away plates and silverware out from under everyones nose so you get the hint it&#39;s time to go. 

All in all, I want to say it was a special day and that Venutis &#34;made it spectacular&#34;. But what made my day spectacular is inviting our Family and friends back to our house afterwards because we felt so rushed out of there, and to truly enjoy each other&#39;s company."

Everything about this place is top notch!  

Now the downfall is this: Karen whom I believe to be one of the event planners there. She has the nastiest persona-attitude ever! No people skills whatsoever-just rude! I would NEVERRRRRR work with her!

I don&#39;t want to go really negative because overall I love this place. I wouldn&#39;t allow one bad apple to spoil the bunch.

If you plan an event here, I&#39;d say unless she has been trained immensely to work with the public and better her people skills I definitely wouldn&#39;t recommend Karen!"

Update on Wedding: my wedding turned out super beautiful and extrodinary lavishing. I picked the wedding package that included hor&#39;dorves we had a open non alcoholic bar. Karen made sure that everything would be on point. I had a cute lemonaid mint bridal special. The bridal room had appetizers that the guests were snacking on and drinks.

The first thing you see when you walk in is a beautiful staircase and really pretty fountain right behind the stairs. When we were mingling during cocktail hour, the view outside was nice and the photo booth room was spacious and inviting.

The ambience was lovely all around.

I usually hate wedding food so I was expecting the same here. I was wrong. The food here was very different and good.

We got little hors d&#39;oeuvres of bacon wrapped scallops, mini beef wellingtons, and bruscetta. All were really good. My favorite was the bacon wrapped scallops.

Once we were seated inside, a server came and asked us what we would be having for our main course. Salmon, chicken, or ribeye. I picked ribeye.

First we got our salad which was 2 thin slices of cucumber holding the salad, which included greens, heart of palm, bell pepper, cherry tomato, and a piece of fresh mozarella. Use the garlic dressing.. it&#39;s so flavorful and good!

The second course was a penne with marinara that they serve fresh. They serve portions right out of the warming tray in front of everyone instead of having it sit on a plate before being served. It was hot and perfect. There&#39;s also a dish of fresh grated parmesan for the pasta. It added a nice touch.

The bread they put on every table tasted freshly baked. The outside was crusty and chewy and the inside was pillowy and soft. So amazing with their whipped butter. It was like eating a buttery cloud.

The main course was ribeye. I asked for mine medium (only choices were medium and well done) and mine was more well done than medium... but it was still tender and delicious. I liked the potatoes, cauliflower, and broccoli that the ribeye came with. All were flavorful and seasoned well.

Dessert was tiramisu. This was also very good. Not too sweet.

Not only was the food great, the service was great too. The servers were friendly and helpful. If we needed something, we got it right away.

I loved my experience here that I&#39;m hoping to do my wedding or some other event here one day. 

P.S. Don&#39;t forget to tip your bartenders! They&#39;re awesome :)"

There was a nice patio, too. After the main room shut down, there was a bar on the side for guests who wanted to keep the party going. As far as food goes, there was a LOT of it. For the main course, guests could choose steak, salmon, or chicken. I had the chicken. It wasn&#39;t great. However, I was able to try the salmon and steak and they were both very good.

Cons: food and service - really bad 

The venue is beautiful, but the food is not very good. My brother had his wedding there, and the portions of soup and salad were almost embarrassing. I&#39;m pregnant with twins and was hoping for a little more soup, and the server had a huge pot of it right on his cart..and when I asked for more soup he said &#34;let me ask&#34; (it was obvious he was blowing me off) and never came back. Also, nobody ever filled the glasses of water at our table (and there weren&#39;t water pitchers.. So half the people at our table were sitting with empty water glasses most of the meal). Then the food came out and I was thinking to myself how bad it tasted (how do you mess up a double baked potato?).. And then I overheard other people talking about how bad it was. When you see plates going back nearly untouched, it&#39;s embarrassing. 

The venue is so beautiful that it&#39;s a shame."

Well my friend did end up getting married there and my wife and I moved out of state shortly after. Totally forgot about the gift card. 2 yrs from today we moved back. I contacted them after 10 yrs from the time my friend got married about the gift card. Owner frank returned my call and said he&#39;s got a gift card.

Our wedding coordinator there was also very nice and accommodating for us, although no one followed up with my husband and me after our wedding. 

As for downsides, unfortunately they outdo the good-sides.  if you&#39;re looking for a venue with a kind, knowledgeable staff, look elsewhere.  The staff was shockingly rude, especially for all that you&#39;re putting into the venue financially.  On our wedding day, we asked our server if we could have a bottle of Riesling.  She had no idea what that was, and we told her it was wine. She then left for a few minutes to &#39;ask the bartender&#39;, came back and said that Venuti&#39;s didn&#39;t have any Rieslings... I was like.... really?  At an Italian restaurant they don&#39;t have one of the most common white wines? My husband went and asked the manager, who than assured us that they had a bottle.  The server then delivered it, slammed it down on the table, said here&#39;s your wine, and walked away....

In addition, expect the same if not worse attitude from the bar tenders if you have your wedding at Venuti&#39;s.  They didn&#39;t know how to make a plethora of drinks, had bad attitudes with our guests, and over served guests (even when myself or another guest said &#34;hey this person has had too much, please don&#39;t over serve them&#34;). We had guests that were horribly drunk and the bartenders still served them, even when I told them not to.  It was terrible.  

For our wedding, we were told that our ceremony room would seat 100.  The day of, the staff only put about 70-75 chairs in the ceremony room.  When my husband asked if more chairs could be brought in, he was welcomed with a rude attitude from the prepper.  It just was an overall horrible experience with their staff.

Overall, this venue is beautiful, well priced, and horribly staffed.

UPDATE: After I posted this, a staff member from Venuti&#39;s wrote a comment asking to call them.. When I asked for the phone number that they would like me to call, I never got a response."

We had to check out the restaurant and met Frank Venuti.  Such a nice man and so easy to talk to. He said they make all their pastas. We raved about the food  The appetizers were heavenly.  Little Arancini balls and mini Beef Wellington  were perfectly cooked and so tasty.  I couldn&#39;t stop eating them. The Penne pasta with vodka sauce was to die for!  Plate licking delicious!  The steak was perfect. Everything was outstanding. We have been back twice since the wedding reception and the food and service is excellent. We have brought friends and intend on bringing more friends and family to this wonderful establishment.  We highly recommend this amazing dining experience.

4 stars for: good selection of food(pastas, meats, soups, pizzas, salads, desserts, veggies), ambiance (beautiful And classy), great value ($12.95 for buffet), and attentiveness of the server. 

They also take reservations, I recommend making one if you&#39;re party is big. They get very busy during lunch. 

Must try: soup, whitefish, and eggplant lasagna. 

Great job Venutis!"

went there for sunday brunch today.  not to good. nobody in our group really liked it.  food was average at best.  service was average or below average.  the venue is nice, but there is something weird about this place.  when there are very few people there at 11:30 for a sunday brunch @ $21/person, something must be wrong.  all other breakfast places in the area are packed at 11:30.  the way they have the food presented at the buffet is very strange.  never seen it like that before.  there are 2 levels of food.  the upper level is like 5&#39; high.  if you are shorter than about 5&#39;4&#34; you can&#39;t even see what is up there and can barely reach it.  their dessert selection was non-existent.  literally 3 items - all of which were not good.  they have lots of nice looking salads, but they don&#39;t taste good.  if you do go for sunday brunch, i would suggest a freshly made omelette.  nothing else worth getting.  very strange food selection for a sunday brunch.  nothing really is setup or coordinated properly.  it&#39;s one of those Italian places that must cater to only Italians or something (I&#39;m not Italian).  it&#39;s a beautiful place, but the food and service and experience was not good."

Knowing the pride, quality and care that Venuti&#39;s takes in its cuisine, the $20 a head price tag worried me a bit. I actually expected it a bit more expensive so I was concerned the fare would be last night&#39;s wedding buffet or something similar. But no...fresh and outstanding food with great value and would have to say our &#34;hostess&#34; for the birthday celebration had to be Momma Venuti. She was friendly with that classic Italian pinache

I&#39;ve been here 5~6x and she&#39;s always got an attitude. Why? A puzzlement. Just looking for a friendly local place and she consistently makes it tough to pick here....  Sad, stupid.

Revisit on 19 June: Astounding indifference from the same bartender. Took my drink order and served it. Offered a menu and then zero contact for 30 minutes in a 30% filled bar. No thanks. Third time&#39;s the charm. Never again. There are far too many places who appreciate your business. Scratch Venuti from my list. Apparently this bartender has pics of someone to hold her job. Sad."

I absolutely LOVE the venue. It was perfect for my wedding. Karen the coordinator was the best- she was wonderful to work with. I love that the venue did everything for me and I just had to bring everything the day before. I didnt need to find helpers to help decorate or set up tables. The food is just delicious and I was so impressed during the tasting and previous meals here that I just had to have my wedding here. Many people who attended my wedding complimented me on the food! The best part was the drinks! I love the top shelf bar and the options have have like martini bar and champagne! Their beautiful fountain at the grand entrance is perfect for photos.

We arrived with multiple friends and were seated however when the owners of the restaurant showed up they made us move tables without an apology or any kind of positive gesture.   After that the owners and their friends were very disrespectful. Including stepping on my toes multiple times and not even apologizing.  You would think that people who want to own a respectable business and have a great customer like myself would have a priority of taking care of their customers first and not being drunken idiots with their friends.    The music was great, the service was wonderful and we really appreciate the low people on the totem pole that work there and had to take care of us."

As far as atmosphere goes, Venuti&#39;s is very nice. I could definitely see why people want to hold their wedding receptions here. The place is pretty gorgeous.

We were seated right away (we had a reservation) at a spacious table. There were 7 of us, so it was nice to not be squeezed in at a small table. Our server was very nice, but overall I&#39;m not sure that I would say he was the most attentive. There was a good span of time that we didn&#39;t see him at all. The food took a while to get to us as well. He did, however, split the risotto my friend and I shared in two separate bowls. So that won him some brownie points.

As much as I love Italian food, I have always had an issue with most Italian restaurants. The amount they charge for things that are not that expensive to make absolutely blows my mind. Venuti&#39;s is no exception. My mouth dropped a little when I saw the prices. Yikes. Not a cheap meal...alright...but if the food is fantastic then no biggie right? The food was good, better than many places I have been to. But, the shrimp risotto we ordered only had 4 shrimp between the two of us...the rest was risotto. It tasted great...but was it worth $27? Not really. I will say that the portions are really big. However, I would rather pay less and have less on the plate. Someone in our group ordered one of the specials and it was almost $50. Woah buddy! Watch out for those specials!

So, it was ok. I would come back, it didn&#39;t offend me. But I wouldn&#39;t rave about it and come here for every meal (I couldn&#39;t afford it even if I wanted to)."

I was very disappointed in the food. We ordered chicken piccata and London broil for our guests, and both options weren&#39;t very good. The chicken portion was TINY, and had a basic cream sauce without capers, that wasn&#39;t very lemony. The London broil meal consisted of a few very thin slices of beef that weren&#39;t very tasty. It was like sliced Italian beef on a plate.  Worst of all the food was cold, like it had been sitting for a while before being served. I was very upset because coming from a Mediterranean family, food is important, and a lot of people did not enjoy themselves at my shower. My last complaint is that the carpets were very dirty. I&#39;m wondering if there was a wedding the night before that they didn&#39;t clean up after. Overall a very disappointing experience. For future baptisms, birthdays and other events, we will no longer consider Venuti&#39;s."

I stuck with rum &amp; cokes all night, which came with too much ice and watered down quickly. All in all the drinks were just OK.

About three years ago I passed Venuti&#39;s for the first time and fell in love with the look of the building.  I told my boyfriend at the time &#34;I want to get married there.&#34; My now Husband and I just got back from our honeymoon and the first thing on my to do list was write a review for this beautiful venue. 

Venuti&#39;s was the only venue that we viewed before making the decision that this was OUR venue. Karen Dragel is one of the HUGE reasons we chose to go with Venuti&#39;s after just one visit.  Her warm and professional personality were very much appreciated throughout the stressful process of planning a wedding.  As a control freak, I followed up with her many times and each time she was already a step ahead of me (thank you for your patience, Karen!).  She truly made me feel like I was the only bride that she was working with...I have heard horror stories of just being another wedding...&#39;get in and get out.&#39; Not with Karen, she truly cared that our day was perfect and it was just that...PERFECT.

I could go on and on how beautiful the venue was, and how amazing cocktail hour was (I could die for those coconut shrimp) but what really mattered the most-the food, and the service. I have gotten countless compliments on how HUGE and juicy the filet was. This is rarely the case with cooking for a group of 200+ but the food was outstanding-from the salad to the pasta, the entire meal was perfection. Not only was the food delicious but the service was outstanding...asking each guest what temp they wanted their steaks and some people even decided last minute instead of steak they wanted the salmon. No problem! My server was so attentive and even delivered my drinks to me from the bar the whole night...talk about feeling important :) 

I can&#39;t say enough good things about Karen and Venuti&#39;s, our day was absolutely perfect down to every detail and I couldn&#39;t be happier with how it all turned out!"

The food and venue were both well above average and I found the staff to be very attentive and courteous.  One has to understand that for any &#34;mass service&#34; there can be bottlenecks, for instance when the entrees come out all 250 at a time or the bar reopens after dinner.  This was not overlooked in our experience as we never had much of a wait and this likely attributed to adequate staffing (lots of service people) and experienced management.

The staff has always been amazing. My family and I have been here for graduation parties, nearly every birthday and they even accommodated us and stayed open late after a funeral. However tonight our experience was different. We went for my birthday as we usually do and my boyfriend got up to use the bathroom. Upon return he was asked to cover himself up due to his tattoo showing. No where is it posted that tattoos are unacceptable in the restaurant. As I stated we&#39;ve been there hundreds of times and neither myself or boyfriend or any friends who have tattoos have been asked to cover ourselves. My boyfriend currently has a broken arm and has a cast which he is unable to cover with any clothing. The staff then proceeded to stare at our table for the rest of the night. Our waiter seemed nice until the end of the night when we received the check. He asked if we would make sure to tip in cash to ensure he would receive a tip. I found tonight to be a very odd and awkward experience and I have never been unhappy with service here until today. Maybe there is new management/staff? Either way I&#39;m not sure we will be returning since apparently tattoos are unacceptable."

So much so that the wedding ceremony I was attending was completely drowned out by the bridal party introductions at the reception next door. I felt so awful for our bride and groom. Understanding that if nothing can be done about sound proofing- staff should work better on timing if the events. Also cocktail hour was WAY TOO crammed and the bar music was way too loud and overshadowed the wedding. I feel like it&#39;s trying to be a banquet hall- but then get revenue from a bar as well. Old rickety desks and an old school copy machine in the entrance was a turn off as well.

It&#39;s nice that it attracts and &#34;adult&#34; demographic and not a bunch of college kids looking to get drunk.
I&#39;ve only visited on the weekends looking for a nice place to dance the night and have a decent drink.  Drinks you can count on but the music could use a much needed change in style (or dj with better taste).  The only dance area is a tinny space, easily crowds to the point almost impossible to move.

Question to the owner:  why not open the other banquet rooms for dancing?...  nicer music and better dance floor might just skyrocket your place."

Salad course looked pretty but was also very small. My favorite course was the pasta with a mushroom cream rreduction it was very flavorful and I finished every bite.The main entree was a breast of lemon chicken. It tasted bland,  as if the chicken was precooked and reheated. We had a nice cannoli cake for dessert."

Venutis is SUCH A BEAUTIFUL venue. Their packages were awesome. What made my whole experience stress free was Karen Dragel. SHe was the coordinator for my wedding. She is outstanding. Easy to work with, responds to my millions of emails quickly, there was nothing she couldnt get together/made/ready for us. She followed my directions well and gave us a wonderful wedding. I have referred many friends to check out the venue if they are looking for a nice place to get married. I just love the service here. Karen is every brides dream!

Attended a very large wedding reception recently. Walked into a lot of confusion I must say. 
Had to walk thru a mob of people eating and drinking in a very small and somewhat dark space. The room of appetizers was very impressive and tasty. What I don&#39;t understand is why the sweet table was already set up with things that should be in the fridge and not sitting out for hours! 
Only one bartender serving at the martini bar for 500 guests?
There were dirty plates and glasses all over with containers left out that busters would use. Not impressed. 
The room is beautiful and never felt crammed. 
We made our way to the table and were roughly asked what we wanted to eat. 
Service was very slow and not attentive at all. The bread on the table was stale. Our water was never refilled. We all felt rushed once each course was served. Like hurry up and eat so we can bring the next plate. But then wait because it&#39;s not coming yet. Weird. 
The steak was delicious but the potato was Not a true croquette. Odd shaped and tasted soggy. Beans were over cooked. 
The bar should not have been out of a liquor when there are three others in the same room. Why wasn&#39;t it stocked for the night. 
There is definitely not enough staff overlooking cleanup. Dirty dishes laying around through out including the brides room filled with them 4 hours after they arrived at th venue. Just gross. 
I was looking forward to being so impressed by this venue as I have sent so many clients there. I think the venue has gotten too comfortable with being booked far in advance and the lack of effort in service shows. 
service is so important and should not for a minute be overlooked. A guest should not have to see a dirty plate or glass when spending several hours there. A guest should not at any time feel rushed during a meal."

The restaurant has fountains and murals, mosaics and a gorgeous spiral staircase inlaid with brass scrolls. There were 8 of us, and we were seated at a magnificent room, by ourselves with a wall of wine, and glass doors closing behind us. 

Now for the service. The menu has Chicken Parmesan described where the manicotti is listed. My friend found peas in her lasagna. (Nothing on the menu states this.) They admitted the menu had some mistakes. Duh.

They couldn&#39;t separate our orders, so we had to figure them out for ourselves. They actually told us, at 5:40 that we would be out by 6:30. By 6:12, we weren&#39;t yet served.   

We got served. they bring you focaccia and garlic bread with olive oil to dip it in. I have never liked eating olive oil, but fine Italian resultants serve bread that way. The focaccia had pepperoni on one kind and the other, cheese. 

The rigatoni I had was really good. I had to rush eat it, cause we weren&#39;t served in a timely fashion. The rigatoni had their fresh home made ricotta cheese. Now that was to die for. 

I&#39;d say, try this place once, then pass on it. I have some amazing pictures of the interior decorations, but interior decorations don&#39;t always make a restaurant."

Keeping the bride calm and just being an all over good person to go to with any questions. He worked with my new husband and I to help make our wonderful day affordable. 
The Pro&#39;s: the food was amazing (lots of it), the place is BEAUTIFUL (we got so many compliments), and the wait staff rocked! 
Cons: The only two cons I would say would be the air conditioning was not good the day of our wedding. We used the chapel to get married in and didn&#39;t think about all the people that would be crammed into that small of a space. I wished we were informed about that before hand. BODY heat to the max.. so things to think about. Also the day of, our wedding coordinator switched twice on us. However they accommodated us with making sure the overall wedding ran smoothly. Which we received compliments on the timing of how things ran so well :) still destructive for a bride and grooms nerves. 
But with the help of Candito and Sierra (BOTH were amazing to work with and so considerate! Sierra - helped my mother in law set up flowers before the wedding and day events. Candito - was the go to man for the reception/everything. Shout out to him for helping make my day what it was) overall they deserve five stars!!! 

Thanks Venuti&#39;s for making our special day magical and memorable.

I was attending a wedding here over the summer however so I was looking forward to see how this place would look.  I walked in &amp; the place looked absolutely awesome.

From the colors to the fountain in the front, the place looked better than most banquet halls I have seen.  The reception took place in two different rooms.  

After the first reception was over everyone went to the lobby for cocktails.  About an hour later the main room was ready for dinner.  


The food here was nice &amp; tender &amp; full of flavor.  The steak was really good &amp; the dessert was awesome.  Overall the place looks awesome inside &amp; out.

The environment is very different on a Sunday morning/afternoon from their typical Saturday night dinners/bar parties. It was much brighter with the large dining hall windows open and the sun shining in, there was light music in the background (great classical Italian songs), there were children running around the dining area, which might be annoying for those unfamiliar with Italian family dining on a Sunday, but I thought it to be nice; it all made me feel like I was enjoying a comfortable family dinner as I normally would on a Sunday.

The main reason there were large groups and children moving around the dining area is because there is a buffet deal offered at Venuti&#39;s on Sundays. It&#39;s an open breakfast/lunch buffet with all the pork, shrimp, and pasta you could ask for. We refrained from trying the buffet though and decided to order separate dishes.

We ordered a dozen baked clams for our antipasto caldo (hot appetizer). The clams are large and very good. The breading is thick and full of flavor, and the juices from the clam seep through the breading when you bite into it. Very good, very fresh. We also devoured the warm bread with oil and cheese, as well as the pieces of focaccia.

My father ordered the sausage and rapini which came with 3 reasonably sized sausage that were smothered in long strains of rapini, with a side of potatoes.

My brother ordered the gnocchi with vodka sauce. A very safe and typical order, but he insisted it was one of the better gnocchi he&#39;s had.

I order the farfalle alla panna. It&#39;s not a set dinner item, but you can create your own pasta dishes by choosing your noodles and type of sauce, so I went with the farfalle (bowtie) noodles and the &#34;alla panna&#34; sauce which is a cream sauce made with imported cheese, prosciutto, onion, mushroom, and peas, I believe this might also be called &#34;alla toscana&#34; at other restaurants. The sauce had just enough thickness, the mushrooms were very large, and with the prosciutto/peas mixed in it had a great flavor. The portion size was large enough that I had to take the rest home.

The service was fair. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and spoke Italian very well which was a pleasant surprise.

Again, another solid visit to Venuti&#39;s."

I had a hankering for Italian food and Venuti&#39;s is close to home with a well known track record. 

The Good:
Free valet parking. 
No wait at 6:30pm on a Saturday night. 
It&#39;s a very lovely dining room. 
The Italian bread and foccacia were fresh. 
The Shrimp Dejonge was very tasty.  
Our server was attentive. 
They have a lot of appetizer and dessert options. 

The Bad:
The Shrimp Dejonge was not served nearly as hot as it should have been. 
The Chicken Parmesan was drowning in tomato sauce...made the breading complete mush. 
My meal arrived lukewarm.   
They quit filling my water glass about halfway through the meal. 

The Ugly:
The hostess was missing the bottom half of her skirt...walking toward us to seat people throughout the evening, we could see more than our fair share of her undercarriage over and over and over. 
When I sent back my dinner, it returned with chunky, dried out sauce aka my entire plate had been microwaved. 
The specials have no prices attached to them because the server reads them outloud. I am not a fan of this at all. 

The hubby wants to try it again. He has an extensive history of eating at Venuti&#39;s. I&#39;m not so sure at this point."

Yelp cliche, but I&#39;m going to go ahead and say &#34;omg I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t reviewed this place yet!&#34;. 

The main reason I love coming to the V-Lounge: Old School Saturday&#39;s. Yup, I&#39;m a fiend for old school house and freestyle music. Julian Jumpin&#39; Perez, Tim &#39;Spinnin&#39; Schommer, Kenny Jammin Jason&#39; alternate weekends spinning here, so the music is right up my alley. Even being 27 and typically the youngest person in the bar, all the tacky looking MILF&#39;s and cougars can&#39;t deter me from having an awesome time.

A few negatives: It&#39;s small and gets crowded. It&#39;s a hassle battling your way through the dance-floor to get to the restroom. You may inadvertently grope someone in the process. But most of the girls (and some guys) don&#39;t seem to mind because people like to party here at the V-Lounge. I actually enjoy partying with people in their mid to late 30&#39;s because they just try to have fun. 

As you&#39;ve gathered from that last paragraph, the positives outweigh the negatives. Long live Old School Saturday&#39;s."

I chose Venuti&#39;s for my June 27, 2013 wedding---honestly, it was hands down the BEST decision I made throughout the year-and-a-half long planning process. Venuti&#39;s was the first venue I saw as I started my search process, and it set the standards pretty damn high for anything else I saw after. I was a REALLY picky bride so every little detail mattered to me--right down to the decor in their bathrooms! 

I am Muslim and had a traditional-ish Pakistani wedding. It was very important that the venue allow outside catering from one of my parent&#39;s pre-approved list of Zabiha-Halaal caterers. I know most venues accommodate South Asian clients, but a lot of times they have their preferred vendors and you are bullied into choosing a caterer you don&#39;t want. 

This is where Karen Dragel comes in. I cannot say enough amazing things about Karen. I literally cannot think of ONE single thing that I asked for that Karen refused. She is quite literally EVERY bride&#39;s dream come true!! Let me tell you, I met 50 other sales reps  at every banquet facility in the state of Illinois--no one catered to my every whim and desire the way Karen did. She worked her magic and got me Halaal Italian food for my wedding!!! At least 3 other venue&#39;s looked at me funny when I asked if their caterers would be able to source Zabiha-Halaal meat because I wanted American/Italian food. 

When we came in for the tasting, the owner himself checked in on my entire family and when I did not like the soups I tried--he went to the kitchen himself and created us the most amazing cream of mushroom soup I have ever had! Everything we sampled was delicious and we were able to fine tune the spices to our liking for my wedding. The food was amazing the day of my wedding--just like our tasting! The service was on POINT. There were more than plenty of servers taking care of my guests. The hors d&#39;ouvr√©s were SO yummy and everyone loved the sparkling juice tower (no liquor was served). 

I HIGHLY recommend Venuti&#39;s to anyone and everyone looking to host an event."

I had scheduled an appointment to view this venue and was very excited to get there and see what they had to offer. All that exciment came to an end once we met Pat the consultant in charge of my appointment. I had with me my fianc√© and both of our parents my maid of honor and my son. As soon as he saw how many of us he made a face which I let slide. The reception venue entrance is very gorgeous but the actual reception room itself was nothing special. Pat seemed like he was in a hurry and didn&#39;t explain much of each room except to make sure that I was aware that there was a 6000.00 difference between the two rooms. Once we were done viewing which literally took less then five minutes we got back to the entrance and Pat asked if I had any questions and I said yes what are your packages like? He then proceeds to hand me a folder and says everything is there. He didn&#39;t even sit us down to explain the packages to us nor care to take our information down. It seemed because we were Hispanic and our parents were speaking Spanish he became annoyed and didn&#39;t even take us seriously. My fianc√© and I became upset and I said out loud to make sure he heard me that he was rude. I became soo mad that I threw the folder on the ground in the parking lot. I just couldn&#39;t believe that they allow people like that to work for places like this. Glad to take my business else where. Ps will def be getting in contact with the owners.

I made a reservation as I didn&#39;t know how busy they would be and they gave me a beautiful table near the fireplace. The host was lovely as well. The only issue was our server. He wasn&#39;t very attentive. It was like he was itching to leave us every time he had to take our order and it&#39;s not like we we were being slow about ordering. Also, when we asked him for suggestions all he had to say was, &#34;everything&#39;s good.&#34; I think he saw that we were a group of younger people, so he assumed he was going to get a bad tip? I don&#39;t know; this is just conjecture, but his sub-par service got him an average tip. Which, by the way, he took to the side and stared at after he took our bill away. I understand you want to see what your tip is, but at least don&#39;t do it in front of your customers. 

Overall, I would go back and just hope I got a different server. :)"

We had an option of Spinach Lasagna or Chicken Marsala. As soon as they took all the orders, they said that they were &#34;out&#34; of the lasagna. So any vegetarians in the crowd were left with no other option. The spinach, walnut salad was ok - some of spinach looked a little old. The chocolate pudding dessert looked pretty nasty too. They should work on their food options.

The place itself was decorated nicely with different banquet rooms that you could rent out. It was kind of strange that we were the only ones renting out one of the rooms but it was a week day - maybe it&#39;s busier on the weekends.

I couldn&#39;t imagine having a wedding here - the decor, although nice is kind of cheesy with an Italian type theme throughout and fake stucco/bricks on the wall with huge murals of the Italian countryside. I guess it&#39;s just not my thing."

Sparse crowd for a Friday night around 7pm.  Food and service were good.  Felt generous and left a $20 cash tip on a $78 bill (paid by credit card).  When we were getting in to our car to leave, our waiter chased us down in the parking lot accusing us of not leaving a tip.  Who does that?  Felt like we were on Mystery Diners.

We had emailed Venuti&#39;s the day after our wedding reception to discuss these issues. We live in another state and weren&#39;t able to set up a time. No one ever got back to us about  We found out last minute that the chef messed up our desserts so they were going to throw in a fruit platter for the guests. The fruit platter was very small. Our tables were suppose to have Cabernet instead of Merlot as my husband hates Merlot and of course Merlot was on every table. They also ran out of Glenlivet even though we are clearly discussed this with Pat at our last final meeting before the event and was one of the reasons why we even booked Venuti&#39;s! (The bartender told us they only had 9 bottles for our wedding reception and the event next door!!!) All of our guests complained about how a lot of them didn&#39;t get any appetizers that were passed even me and my husband didn&#39;t get any at all. Our dinner was suppose to start a specified time and it did not (our wedding planner was blamed for the delay when in fact the kitchen wasn&#39;t even ready to serve). There was a huge delay in between courses as well. My husband and I didn&#39;t even get a chance to eat a full dinner, we only had soup/salad because our program was delayed based on the delay of dinner being serviced. The salad was completely soggy and not even edible. We felt that Venuti&#39;s wasn&#39;t able to handle a wedding reception of 400 people and unfortunately we do regret out decision. Please keep all of these in mind before booking here as we were extremely unhappy with our service and have still yet to hear from anyone!!!"

Their food is still pretty good BUT it&#39;s not the same as it used to be. I know it&#39;s been many years since the one on North Avenue closed but really, their portions got smaller and they jip you out of the free cheesecake they used to give out at the end of the meals. 

Still, their food is worth going for. I love their fried calamari for an appetizer and linguini with clam sauce for dinner. Yum!"

Chances of that...slim. I even joked and said, well the food better be good or I will dread going there the second day.

Here is the low down:

Elegent! It definitely has the WOW factor as soon as you step in to a waterfall and winding staircase.

Well appointed bars, which completely eliminates long lines for a drink.

Has a main bar if your early or want to stay a bit later.

Food was superb! Had steak two nights in a row (not by choice) but regardless - it didn&#39;t get old and the two entrees were different at each event.

The space itself is a perfect set up and has a &#34;greek god esc&#34; decor of cream and gold. Everything was clean and well kempt.

The service was immpeccable, each banquet table had their own dedicated waitstaff on both nights. So, when I asked for A-1 (yes I&#39;m a fan, get over it) - they obliged without hesitation. They cleared everything promptly and kept the events moving forward. It really was orchestrated well.

In closing, both events were well planned and I had a ton of fun, two nights in a row at the same place.

Well done Venuti&#39;s - I was impressed!"

The travertine walls , marble fireplace, and grand columns look like something the Romans would have built during their empire. My wife and I stopped here for an early weekend before Valentines Day dinner. The meal begins with fresh bread including tomato pan bread and light tasting olive oil with fresh Parmesan and possibly Romano cheese on the linen clad tables. I ordered a Stella and she had a French Martini. The waiter handed me a bottle of cold beer and I found it strange that I had to ask for a glass, but he immediately brought me a chilled Stella glass. We ordered the baked clams, veal picante , chicken picante, and side garden salads with italian dressing. The clams tasted fresh, the salad was crisp and just the perfect portion, I enjoyed my veal, but my wife didn&#39;t like the chicken. It wasn&#39;t because the chicken wasn&#39;t good it was because she expected egg battered and ordered picante instead of Marsala by mistake. The two reasons I didn&#39;t rate five stars is..
1) I had to ask for a glass for my drink
2) the waiter didn&#39;t take our entree order until 10 minutes after the appetizers were finished
The overall price was pretty inexpensive.
About $35 dollars per person with cocktails and tip. We will return."

This place is awesome! The restaurant is easily a 4.5. Wait staff is attentive and knowledgable. The main dining room is elegant and being an Italian restaurant decorated with all the Christmas ornaments.  It immediately put our group in the Holiday spirit. 

The food was excellent, friends had the ribeye...mama Mia...what a piece of meat. The portion and quality easily could be a $50 plate at a top steakhouse...now here&#39;s the kicker...hold on to your hat....the price was half that! 

The bread basket had both Italian and focaccia and along with the olive oil and fresh grated cheese, was a meal in its self. The ap portions where enough for 6. 

The wine list was not extensive, but adequate. The prices were reasonable. A few good selections in the $30 - 40 range. 

Overall, with a round of drinks, wine, meal and above avg tip, $50pp.

The service was horrible at best, and the food was luke warm at best.  A waiter needed to pass our table to and from tables and when he would pass he would raise his banquet tray above and over our table to come and go to the dinning room.  He never apologized and besides carrying the tray over the table he bumped into my daughters chair 4 times.  I yelled out to him can you take another route and I received the look that could kill you.  As the friends of what looked like the manager arrived they received the royal treatment, well I hope their around more often to make up for the guests your losing daily.  Treat all of your customers the same and you will have a much better chance to survive in this business.

Our server was overwhelmed, between ordering appts. and dinner it took her 30 minutes for the server to return to take our dinner order.  And as far as refills on drinks it took longer.  We arrived at 6:10 pm for dinner and left at 8:05 without ordering desert since we wanted to be home by midnight.  Many guests sitting around us were very frustrated with service.  The manager was very animated when barking out orders to his staff about which tables need service first. 

A very nice ambiance, prices are good but the service is terrible at best, I will not return."

I came to Venuti&#39;s V-Lounge a couple months ago to celebrate my close friends&#39; 2nd anniversary with them over drinks ((2nd note: They had their wedding at Venuti&#39;s 2 years ago and it was gorgeous - Venuti&#39;s did a knock-out job)).

::The Scene::
Old, creepy Italian men, cougars, &amp; a little Jersey Shore. By 11pm the place was packed like a sardine can. The lounge is fairly small, but we were fortunate enough to get a couple tables for the 6 of us.  Thank goodness because being in the mix of everything was flat out annoying. You had some people hanging at tables drinking, club rats dancing to Julian Jumpin Perez or whoever, cougars circling (literally) the bar knocking into people while trollin&#39; for young bucks, and pervy old dudes hitting on  girls who could pass as their daughter. Just a regular old night in Addison I guess.

::The food &amp; drinks::
Food wasn&#39;t bad. We order melon and prosciutto and fried calamari. Both were good. The prosciutto was salty and meaty....just how I like it wrapped around sweet melon. 
The drinks were eh. My dirty martinis had way more olive juice than they should, which means the bar tender was skimping on the booze. Not cool.

Between the crappy music, mixed bag of a crowd, and weak-ass expensive drinks, I&#39;m not sure I will be hitting up the V-Lounge at Venuti&#39;s. It&#39;s just not my scene...at least not for another 10-15 years."

So, my Mel&#39;s work got one of the banquet rooms and hired a DJ to rock out and celebrate the year coming to an end. The service was phenom, the bartender was super sexy and she knew how to sling some drinks, the food was pretty darn good too. Once the party wrapped up and the banquet room was closed out, we headed our way over to the restaurants bar area to dance it up with the rest of the old Italian men and cougars... it was pretty fun but the bar service was not as great as the banquet service.

From checkerboard floors to neon lights they&#39;re all similar in decor, but not necessarily similar in food. Before jumping into the review of this particular Scooby&#39;s I should probably go over some general observations about the others I&#39;ve visited.

Scooby&#39;s in West Chicago makes a very solid hot dog, the condiments there aren&#39;t too heavily applied, the frankfurter is a little longer than the bun. There has been at times a slight bologna flavor to the sausage but overall I&#39;m happy with their food though not necessarily their pricing. The Downers Grove Scooby&#39;s makes a similar hot dog. I&#39;ve never tasted the bologna flavor to it and I recall them being slightly less expensive.

So you&#39;re probably wondering what&#39;s different about this Scooby&#39;s than the others? Well that difference is the care put into the actual assembly of the hot dog. The pickle slice on this hot dog was large and in charge. The tomato slices were huge and watery, the mustard and relish were applied a bit too heavily. This resulted in a very sloppy hot dog that nearly fell apart as I attempted to consume it. The taste was overwhelmingly unbalanced with pickle and mustard being the dominant flavors.

I suspect that the Scooby&#39;s are unrelated to one another and that the style of hot dog assembly differs as well.l was definitely disappointed having tried other Scooby&#39;s with much better food. My thoughts on this particular Scooby&#39;s or at least the thoughts of another Scooby and his buddy Shaggy on this can be heard in this audio file in the link.

I had a bad morning this past weekend, so I wanted to treat myself (treat yo self) and get something especially tasty. I was bombarding the Yelp search engine for nearby gyro places I haven&#39;t tried, and when everything I found in a 5 mile radius* was closed, I knew I always had Scooby&#39;s on reserve for a go-to delicious feel-good meal. Please note that I normally select Scooby&#39;s as a destination, not a fall back, but on this day I was feeling adventurous at first (then just plain hungry).

[*Note: I carry out, so 5 miles is my radius of limitation]

I have always said that for one to enjoy a gyro, one must commit to the gyro. I really do say this and I think I make a valid point because gyros are awesome, but they definitely stick with you all day. I&#39;m happy I committed to this gyro, because it was fantastic, and they really loaded it up. Not only do the gyros rock, their fries will always blow me away. On occasion, if my parents ever got a jones for Johnnie&#39;s Beef, they would get the sandwich, but stop at Scooby&#39;s on the way home to get a load fries and a Green River. 

To be objective and give constructive criticism, the gyro tasted great, but some pieces were a little well done. I vastly appreciate this imperfection over the greasy/slimy gyros I&#39;ve gotten elsewhere in the past, I just thought it needed to be addressed. 

Although it would be nice, I know I can&#39;t eat gyros every weekend; I&#39;d go broke and get fat, but I really enjoy what Scooby&#39;s has to offer.  

And with all the madness in the world these days, it&#39;s really nice to have comforting food offered so close to home."

No matter how busy, how long the line, the counter staff never fails to disappoint in taking your order with a smile filling, your styrofoam cups of GREEN RIVER (!!!!!!!) lickety split. Of course you&#39;ll need a large green river to wash down all the eats because they give you healthy portions for your buck.  Don&#39;t worry, if you run low, refills are always on the house.

Their 6 month anniversary is right around the corner, and next week would be an awesome time to give them a try. They&#39;ll be dishing out $1 hot dogs and tamales, $2 pizza puffs and $3 gyros and meatball sandwiches. They have other discounted menu items in that price range between 7.9.09 and 7.12.09, but the prices are always fair, special deals or not. 

Even if you don&#39;t find yourself in this neck of the woods often, you&#39;ll inevitably find yourself stuck in traffic westbound or eastbound on I-90 at some point during your tenure as a Chicagoan. Rather than deal with wall to wall traffic, cheesy radio commercials and truck drivers cutting you off, do yourself a favor. Get of at the Arlington Heights Road exit. Head north. Stop at Scooby&#39;s and sip on a Green River and chow on a gyros and fries (extra sauce, of course!) and wait out the war zone we call rush hour traffic. You&#39;ll thank me. And it&#39;s much more fun than road rage. And WAY tastier than the food at the Des Plaines Oasis."

She made a steak sandwich and fries that looked so good, they stayed on my mind.  Just gnawing at me.  Unrelenting.  I had to have it!  

 Whenever I splurge on &#34;fast food&#34;, I make sure that it&#39;s real food, from a family owned restaurant.  No processed chemical garbage from a chain

I thought about a place that I had seen several times and always made a mental note to stop in some time.  Today was the day I would check out Scooby&#39;s.  The minute I walked in the door I saw a sign with the special of the day.  

It was a skirt steak sandwich with fries.  Okay- this was meant to be.

The sandwich was delicious and the fries were incredible.  The staff was friendly and courteous.  The place was clean &amp; cute.

 I&#39;ll be back."

Being that I am from the neighborhood, I appreciate that there is a place like this since they are pretty rare in our area. Prices are decent, service is good, and decor seems to fit the vibe of the restaurant. Seems like the owner is always there, or at least he&#39;s always there when I&#39;m there, which is good to see. And they serve GREEN RIVER, a Chicago classic! The food is standard, no complaints. Good cheeseburgers, kosher vienna hotdogs, italian sausage, gyros, etc.

As for the fries, I happen to love them, but it is very hit or miss with people because I know that some of my friends aren&#39;t to fond their fries either. They are on the greasy side, but I like how they are thicker which allows them to get slightly crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. They also cook them to a bit of a darker golden brown, which I think gives them great flavor. But that&#39;s just what I think.

All in all, Scooby&#39;s is a great choice if your in the neighborhood and looking for a good local place to grab a quick bite that will be satisfying and cheap. I definitely recommend it!

NOTE: Minimum purchase with a credit card is $5, and they don&#39;t give out free cups of water. I wouldn&#39;t have mentioned the last part, but there is a sign at the register that says &#34;Bottled Water Only.&#34; I guess it&#39;s pretty important. lol"

Chili is from a can.  Otherwise very expensive for what you get.  Someone on Yelp recommended the ribeye steak sandwich.  $6 for the thinnest, blandest excuse for a piece of &#34;meat&#34; I&#39;ve ever had.  Worst steak sandwich in memory.  I didn&#39;t want pop, asked for water.  They only sell bottled water, no glasses of ice water.

I&#39;m being nice with 2 stars.  If your taste for fast food transcends the high school palette, you won&#39;t like this place.  My friend&#39;s 5 yr old loves this place, it&#39;s right up her alley.  People should be a lot friendlier.  I won&#39;t go back.  Try Riviera in downtown Arl Hts instead.

It was my first time here.  We waited at the host stand for a minute or two while we watched what seemed like the only employee helping out other customers. We weren&#39;t sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or not... no one was at the host stand. After a moment we were greeted politely by the male server and were escorted to a table.  I looked over the menu and saw they had quite the variety of items. Lots of vegetarian items too! Since it was my first time here I wasn&#39;t sure what to get. My group started out with chips and salsa. They were surprisingly delicious! We asked for more. Our server, whose name was Andrew, was very attentive and gave us many helpful recommendations, Thursday&#39;s are half priced quesadillas. What a steal. I was so pleased that they had a vegetarian option (Pesto/tomato/feta). They came with a green salsa and sour cream. I demolished them! My colleagues also got different variations of the quesadillas! All of which were good. I got an Ice- T but it seemed watered down. I told the server and he immediately appeared which a freshly made batch which was much better. The server Andrew seemed to really care about our experience. I liked how genuine he was. I am sick of going to places and hearing the servers sound like robots. Andrew was friendly, funny and a delight to be around! Overall, I was very pleased with my experience. I will definitely be stopping in again. I noticed a veggie burger that I think I&#39;ll try next time."

I like that there is a conveniently close parking garage next to the train station for this place. Not sure.if.you need to pay after 9pm... hopefully not, since I didn&#39;t.

Hmm, from the outside you might mistake this as a movie theater, but its list of pending music acts. The main floor seems like a cafeteria. It&#39;s cooler upstairs with energy and a blonde girl DJ... top 40s. It&#39;s okay... The rooftop patio is fun.

The 2 bartender girls (Amy D. and a pregnant one) up here are sketch though. My friend got a vodka cranberry seltzer that tasted like water to me... a non drinker. Grey Goose shot to add to make it taste better was $7. Hmm $14 for a drink, not cool.

Amy told me the Late night menu doesn&#39;t start til 11pm. Someone told me it started in 15m at 10pm, then repeated the story at 10:30pm. Lame... but their bar menu says its supposed to be at 10pm... I&#39;m thinking the staff is sketchy. Hangry...

I&#39;ve had many a great time here listening to music, enjoying a lunch on their patio and drinking more than a few beers at their bar. (And if you love pulled pork, it is one of their staples and consistently a great sandwich.) 

Last night I went to see another great tribute band that Mark booked.  This is the perfect venue for listening to live music.  Much like House of Blues downtown, you can be on the main floor enjoying it with the crowd, or you can sit upstairs where you get a clear view of the stage, but you can still eat and drink and carry on a conversation (because you&#39;re not in direct line of the speakers). The nice thing about Durty Nellies is you don&#39;t have to be a &#34;member&#34; to sit up stairs like you do at House of Blues. So if you have a favorite group, I recommend you wait until they come here and go see them in the perfect setting.  Or if you like dance music from a DJ, they also have that in the main bar on weekends.

TIP: There are tables right at the upstairs railing where you can relax, drink and eat.  But these tables typically get reserved quickly.  So as soon as you know you&#39;re going to a concert, call them and reserve one."

This could be serious stuff...like contact the Better Business Bureau-type stuff.

What&#39;s this all about?

Well, my wife ordered their basic Black Angus burger, which on the menu is $7.

She added bleu cheese and onions and ordered garlic fries. 

There is no mention of how much these additional items are on the menu, outside of a &#34;prices may vary&#34;. That&#39;s a lot of leeway.

When the check came, her $7 burger was now $16. $16. That&#39;s what I would expect to pay for this burger in the city!

I had a plain burger (also $7) and added bacon. Had regular fries on the side and my meal was $12. 

Between the two of us (with two rounds of craft beer) and our son&#39;s grilled cheese sandwich, the total was just short of $65. 

That wasn&#39;t going to work.

I had the waitress take a few dollars off and I am here to say buyer beware.

Too bad, because their food is good...not the greatest around, but solidly good.

Sort this out and we&#39;ll be back when you do.

I&#39;ve been on several different occasions recently, as we have, unfortunately, grown tired of the frat boy shenanigans at Lamplighters. Sometimes for drinks and a show, others for a full meal. 

Let me say, the food is definitely on par with some of my favorite restaurants in the area. The nachos are an enormous portion and they taste amazing. The wings are great, I recently tried their red pepper hummus, and I&#39;m not a hummus person, but I loved it! Very delicious. Their gourmet burgers are top notch, I&#39;ve had the regular beef, as well as the bison, and the turkey and all three are perfect. The bison is tender and juicy, and the turkey is made with a beautiful blend of spices and it just melts in your mouth. My new favorite item though is the Turkey BLT. I get it without kale because, gross, healthy food. It is excellent! Definitely a must have! The mac and cheese is just okay. 

Nellie&#39;s loses a star from me because I find their mixed drinks good, but a little on the pricey side for the size. Their beer menu is excellent and has a lot of great choices. Service is mostly good, the past few times I have been we had Becca as our server and she was excellent. Very polite, attentive, and fun! I really enjoy the dueling pianos on Friday nights and the majority of their main stage acts are pretty good.

And I&#39;m glad I finally did! The music room had nice acoustics, and our &#34;VIP&#34; package allowed four of us old 30-something&#39;s the opportunity to sit at a table in the balcony, above the slam-dancing, mosh-pitting emo/punk rocker kids and have a dedicated server bring the booze to us, rather than have to go get it ourselves.

A box office window of sorts would help this place out a lot. It was a little colder last night, and the &#34;lobby&#34; was so jammed with people waiting to check in/pick up tickets, it was a little disorganized chaos.

My concert experience was incredible. It really seemed like there wasn&#39;t a bad place to stand in the house. We stood upstairs for awhile in the balcony and could still see everything. When we moved downstairs, we stood near the back because we&#39;re old and can&#39;t get down like we used to. We could still see everything in the back too.

I liked that the crowd that night was completely mixed with younger and older people alike. That always makes for a fun time because you can just be yourself and let it all hang out. 

We had a fantastic server too (I wish I remembered his name.) He was incredibly busy but he showed us a lot of attention and made sure to answer a lot of questions and give recommendations around the beer menu and food. We ordered the fried pickles and knife and fork fries. The fried pickles were cooked to perfection and some of the best that I&#39;ve had so far.

I also love how vegetarian friendly they are! :)  Our server was friendly, but not as attentive as I would have preferred since they weren&#39;t that busy when we were there."

And the door is usually $7 for a show so it doesn&#39;t really break the bank. They try to be a craft beer bar but they mostly carry the drafts in bottles not tap. About 12 to 15 taps in the front bar. Not many in the upstairs or concert area bar.

A group of us ended up at the Durty for my sisters birthday. We got there around 11:00pm so it was a little early and the crowd was a little light. A cover band was playing, of course, and the cover was $5. I believe it was six to midnight that were playing, and it was a damn good time. 
They had some good drink specials including $4 Vegas Bombs. I thought this was really weird, but they do not serve Miller...not that big of a deal but a little strange. Drinks are priced right, $5 for a Tito&#39;s double with soda, and $3 Coronas. 
The place itself is open and there are a lot of places to congregate with friends. Of course, our group was in the band area dancing our asses off on the dance floor.

My friend got his wallet stolen right before he payed for his drink at the bar. He was purposely distracted in a team-effort. Then coincidentally two minutes after, someone behind the bar hands it back to him. Wow that was suspiciously quick!!

       ALL THE CASH WAS MISSING! 
EXCEPT $5 FOR THE DRINK HE JUST F*EN BOUGHT!!! I can&#39;t believe how suspicious this whole scenario was!!

We literally JUST ARRIVED and went straight to the bar to order a drink, maybe you should actually make sure someone is drunk before you scam them!!!

And then they threw him out by the neck and choked him because, He was obviously was exposing their scam!  THEY DIDNT EVEN GIVE HIM A COURTEOUS &#39;Please leave&#39; JUST AUTOMATICALLY GRABBED HIM BY THE NECK!!! 

HE IS DISABLED!!!!

 It was FOR SURE the workers who thieved him! 

To make the matter worse, they made him go across the street to call the police and across the staff was laughing at him and flicking him off!!!

       The police arrived and the bouncer ran over quick to &#34;talk&#34; to the cop. Who knows what he said because, the cop came to us hostile. We just arrived there when this happened. No one was even close to inebriated.

      I&#39;VE DONE MY RESEARCH and found out they do not have cameras and that is why the workers steal. They have been doing this for a while. It is a scam! This time they have done it to the wrong people!

They&#39;ve recently done some remodeling so it feels clean and pleasant. I&#39;ve only eaten in the dining space but there is a full bar in eyesight and more space around the corner I believe. Bathrooms could use some remodeling, but since one does not usually spend most their time in there, I won&#39;t go on since it was nothing too offensive. Lot parking, can get full so there is a parking garage nearby. Right by the train tracks.
    Large menu assortment. Burgers are a good option: grass-fed, organic, sirloin cut, etc. I love the Durty Mac n&#39; Cheese, you can get all sorts of toppings on it (at additional cost)! Various other options too, some local foods, meatloaf, wraps, salads, and quite a selection of beer! I know last time some of our party got the Space Station Middle Finger and my sister got one, whose name I don&#39;t recall, that she said had a bit of a coffee flavor so of course she loved it.
    Our waiter on our last visit, Josh, was fantastic. Really attentive but not obnoxiously so. Kept our drinks filled, really informative about the beer selection, and all around a really nice guy (and I do say a rather attractive fellow). Another thing I appreciated was when another waiter did a run around to all the tables asking if anyone had any last requests for the kitchen (it was pretty late).
    I&#39;ll be back, at any rate. FYI, novelty item they have is a &#34;Breathalyzer&#34; at the door. Josh said it was more of just that, a novelty thing, but if you&#39;ve had a few, try it for a laugh!... and don&#39;t drink and drive. Also, they have live music nights, so if you&#39;re looking for an enjoyable night out with some friends, Durty Nellie&#39;s seems like a fun option."

When the manager man asked how our food was, I replied that &#34;Not good.

The concert venue is small and intimate. Great for that artist you love as your can get very close. Although, they lost 2 stars because of the condition of their concert venue bathroom.

In this case, I went with a good friend to see New Found Glory.  So get this guys, bars at the main floor are closed.  Yup!  You have to walk upstairs and get yourselves a drink, and that&#39;s not all.  You can not leave the upstairs with drink at hand.  You have to remain there until you are done with the drink.  Not to mention, since the is only one open bar, it take a cool 30 minutes or so to work your way up to the bar, and even then the bar tenders are overwhelmed with drink orders.  Another bonus you ask?  Mixed drinks are WEAK!!! I had 4...count em&#39; 4 Jack and Coke with no buzz, (btw, that is after a one month alcohol free health routine). Do yourselves a favor and order 4 beers, and double fist them bad boys for the remainder of the night. 
  I have to give it to them though, they made the ambiance hilarious.  People watching all these hardcore punk rockers disgruntled, swearing, pissed off, and speaking obscenities under their breath was one of the funniest things I&#39;ve see in a long time.

My first visit here was to see a local band and we had dinner first.  Lots of locally sourced food and options for things like burgers.  Veggie?  Buffalo?  Exotic and expensive organic beef?  Regular hamburger?  You name it.  My husband had  a sort of build-your-own regular cow burger, medium rare, and it was huge and very good.  We&#39;ve been twice now and last time I had a veggie wrap that was just okay.  Not especially big with a meager dollop of goat cheese on top.  eh...  Lots of different and interesting beers and hard cider on tap.  Service is good.

But back to the music...never did see how that went.  Our band, which advertised themselves as playing at 8, was actually the third in the lineup and that was way past our bedtime for a weeknight.

The price of the tickets were pretty decent and hey, my husband and I were in need of a date night after spending 24/7 with out 3 month son.

Parking was decent. We lucked out with a good spot. We opted to eat at the nearby Subway before the show, mainly because we just wanted something fast and mindless. I have heard good things about their food though. The show was all ages so 21 and older had to drink in this upstairs bar that over looks the stage. It got a little full up there but it was okay. Most people were polite and very little of my beer was spilled. I drank Green Line all night which was reasonably priced and got this new mother &#34;where she needed to be&#34;. One day my tolerance will come back. The bathrooms upstairs were actually pretty clean. I mean..I was expecting to be pissing in something one step below a gas station off the highway. But nay, these were fine. 

This review is also for the bitch who was seated upstairs. Why Yelp review a patron? Because this woman is exactly the type to hop on Yelp to bitch about their $6.50 pitcher of Bud Light. So basically there were tables up against this barrier that over looks the stage. Most diners (who were there to see the show too..so I&#39;m ASSUMING New Found Glory fans) were pretty cool about letting the rest of us sorta get closer to the barrier so you could at least see the stage. But not this one particular sad excuse for a human. She set up this strange barrier of chairs. As if she was trying to make her own &#39;private box&#34;. Silly me, I pushed a chair in so I could get closer and she FLIPPED HER SHIT ON ME. A grown woman made this awful scene during the opening song because I pushed a chair in and DARED to move near her and her friend. Who also, fuck your friends lady. Talk about embarrassing.  Everyone standing behind me was equally stunned. THEN some poor girl made the same mistake I did. She was trying to take pictures. The angry beast proceeded to yell &#34;Get somebody...Get somebody&#34; while the girl explained she was trying to take photos for the venue. Now, even if that was a lie..still no reason for someone to go off like this. She then started yelling about how someone fucked with her pitcher of beer (nobody did..nobody could get that close to her goddamn table).  I started to get bummed. This was our rare &#34;date night&#39;. A chance for us to enjoy music of our youth and this bitch was making a scene. During the 4th song we went down to the pit. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. Everyone was friendly. A community finally. I got down in the pit for the first time in like 7 years and my husband started to crowd surf. The show was much better down there. The people and the sound. 

So if that woman IS reading this: You&#39;re really pathetic and example of why people leave the scene. You&#39;re Judy from Accounting. You&#39;re the one that drinks the last cup of coffee at the office and doesn&#39;t make a new pot THEN complain when there is none. You&#39;re the dangerous bitch that cuts people off on the road.

I remember the old Nellie&#39;s so there is some nostalgia but it has definitely changed a lot. I went at lunch on a Saturday because I heard they serve food. They do! It was really good. I read other reviews reporting the opposite but that was not my experience at all. We had wings and burgers - so good! My burger was cooked as ordered and very juicy. The bun was soft. My daughter had chicken strips - good. The wait staff was attentive and the manager even stopped by a few times to check in. Will definitely be back.

1. A restaurant. I have never eaten here, so I cannot honestly rate this place as a restaurant.

2. A bar. I have imbibed at this place several times. Whenever I am here, I am always here for live music which in my opinion is there biggest strength. The bartenders are always polite, friendly, and quick to serve you your drinks. The atmosphere of the place changes depending on where you are. The main room/restaurant area is cavernous and open. People usually crowd the bar area, and it is very bright (not my style). The upstairs is usually extremely crowded if you can even get up there. The bar is smaller, and the area is pretty generic and plain but you can see the stage. As a bar I would give this place 3 stars. My favorite place is on the floor in front of the stage. The back of the room is a huge bar, and they have a decent light and sound set up. Which is the last purpose...

3. A venue. I have seen several bands here. The band that plays every Thursday (Rod Tuffcurls &amp; The Bench Press) are a lot of fun, and they play anything and everything, from Call Me Maybe to the Wrigley Doublemint theme to Magic Dance from the Labyrinth to the NIN classic Closer. I went here and saw 16 Candles (80s cover band) recently. There show is always fun, but it is pretty much the same every time I have seen them. The lights are always great, and the sound is always clean and crisp and LOUD. I would rate this place as a 4 to 4.5 as a venue.

The only drawback I would say is the crowd can be really hit or miss or miss. I have been here and been surrounded by a bunch of tank top wearing bros and/or pop collared dbags, and I have also been here and been surrounded by a much older crowd. The place can get messy, and I have had beer spilled on me more times than I would like, but I am not entirely convinced that my friends aren&#39;t responsible for that. Overall, I give this place a 3.75 and round it up to a 4."

They usually have good bands.But the customer service SUCKS!  After last night, I want to give them one star.  Here is what happened to me last night, as I reported to groupon. 

My friend and I bought tickets with the wristband package for the show at Durty Nellies.  She tried calling calling to find out what time the wristband deal started.  She was directed to the answering machine for the event planner and was never called back.  I tried calling on Friday and left a message on the manager&#39;s voicemail and never received a call back.  At this point, I was a little frustrated.  I called the same day of the show and the girl at the front desk had no idea what I was talking about and when to get the manager.  The manager told me the two hour open bar started whenever you got there and they would write the time on the wristband. I asked him what time the bands started and he said around 9:30 or 10 pm. I told him we would be there then.

When we went to redeem our groupons, we were told the open bar would be over in 15 minutes.  When I explained what the daytime manager told me, the current manager was extremely rude and indifferent.  He told me &#34;no one else here seemed to have a problem with figuring out the start time&#34;.  I later found out this was untrue and that there were several people unhappy with the groupon deal.  I was a bit upset at this point.  In the hospitality business, you to not just turn your back on someone. As he turned to walk away, I said &#34;how do you plan on fixing this?  It was your manager that misinformed me?&#34;  He offered to buy me one drink.  I told him that would not be acceptable.  At that point, another manager came over and told me he would contact groupon and tell you to reimburse my friend and me.  

When we did enter, there was a lack of communication with all of the staff.  They would not let us enter the area where the wristband package was being offered telling us it wa a private party.  Then, I saw them serving well liquor when it said the package was call liquor.  The bar that they allocated for the groupon deal was double booked with a birthday party.  It was small and staffed with only two bartenders and there were a lot of complaints about not getting drinks and people were literally pushing to get to the front!  I also found out that the band started closer to 8:30, so we had missed the Green Day cover band that I really wanted to see!

This experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  Pair that up with the fights, drunk people spilling liquor on you and girls falling all over the place slipping their nasty hair back at you... I really hate other people&#39;s hair."

I&#39;ve been here a bunch of times before, sometimes just for drinks upstairs on the sundeck and sometimes just for a casual lunch on the patio.

The menu is pretty varied and includes many types of burgers, from buffalo and turkey (have had and approve of both) to good old American beef, many different sandwiches and salads and even some comfort meals like meatloaf and mac and cheese.  

I went for something outside the box this time and got a beet salad, which the waiter said was one of their more popular salads, and although it was pretty good, I wouldn&#39;t rave about it and probably wouldn&#39;t order it again.

We were there at a really odd time - too late to call it lunch and too early to call it dinner, but that was a plus as there was no wait time at all and we weren&#39;t rushed in any way to finish up.  Our waiter was super friendly and offered suggestions and made sure we had everything we needed. 

Overall this is a great place to grab a bite to eat - especially if you are looking for a nice, quiet outdoor lunch or dinner."

I stumbled onto this place quite by accident in the course of an unsuccessful foot search for Emmet&#39;s Palatine location.

Currently 29 taps, 109 bottles, and 6 cans, some of which I&#39;ve never seen at specialty-beer places in the city--even several Mikkeller and Evil Twin lines that were new to me.  Worth the trip!

As always, the entire group (hundreds of people) of trainees and trainers pick out a local bar with live music to get our drinking and dancing on. The owner was great, he walked around and really seemed to make an effort to keep service on top of things. 

Here is the issue- this place, maybe because of it&#39;s location, attracts all sorts of scoundrels and wannabe thugs.

At the end of the night, we were standing around waiting for people to close out tabs and for cabs and UBER rides to arrive. I look to my left and I see a 240lb guy take out a pair of brass knuckles (no joke... who does this?) and try to start a fight with another patron half his size. The guy with the brass knuckles keeps threatening him and his friends and showing his brass knuckles. Cool dude. This goes on for minutes, and minutes, and minutes. Where are the bouncers? Oh they all look drunk too. Great. Finally, somebody comes and chokes out the guy with the brass knuckles and the police come. By the way the staff and others acted, it definitely seemed like this stuff happens on the reg here. Definitely not appropriate for people with any class or people on business.

Entire place smelled like a stinky armpit and dirty ass the entire night. The crowd there was super-sketchy meth addicts. All suburban rebel wanna-bes. 

I saw Yelawolf perform a concert here last night. No doubt, Yelawolf is great to see live. I&#39;ve seen him before at the House of Blues - Chicago and it was the best concert I ever been to. But, Durty Nellie&#39;s made it AWFUL to enjoy. The sounds-system was horrible. I&#39;ve been to house parties that pump music much harder than this place. Give me a break!

There is only one bar and it&#39;s really small, takes forever to get a drink. And, they closed the bar on the main level. WHY??? It&#39;s a concert, don&#39;t you want people drinking?? Place has no sense. It disturbed me to be there. 

I will I NEVER-EVER go back to this dirty-smelly shit hole. They should have the City of Palatine check this place for rats and roaches. 

But, Yelawolf himself was very entertaining. He was the only thing that made up for this mistake of driving from Chicago to Palatine. 

Bottom line is Derty Nellie&#39;s is outright disgusting, don&#39;t ever go here. It totally sucks! You will wish you never did. Unless, you like places that have extremely slow bars, sketchy looking staff and crowds along with a horrible stench, this place is for you!"

Frankly, Nellie&#39;s was much more fun when I had just graduated college, and could wait until 11pm for a band to start without getting annoyed.  Now, call me an old lady, but if a band is going to start at 10, they should start at 10.

The back room is always jam packed.  To the point where you don&#39;t even want to bother going to the bathroom, or risk losing your group of friends forever.  The bartenders are okay, but overworked, so I understand their stress.

Had my &#34;birthday party&#34; there a few years ago.  Another friend organized it, and had corresponded with one of the managers via e-mail, reserving us a space in the upstairs so we wouldn&#39;t run into the aforementioned crowd problem.  The manager confirmed our &#34;reservation&#34; with us, and we were all set.  This was 3 weeks before the event.  The day of I decided to call to confirm, and lo and behold, they do not have our reservation anywhere, and there are no managers in.  It took several HOURS for the situation to be resolved, including being hung up on by rude staff members. In the end, they squeezed in a spot upstairs for us, as they had over-booked the upstairs room and we were just as crowded as we had been downstairs.  Some of our friends were not able to get upstairs to meet us.  No one came to apologize."

Enter Durty Nellie&#39;s. 

This was just our first stop on our Day O&#39; Fun for her birthday, and it was a great start to a fabulous day.  We were catching the train to the city around noon, so we needed a quick lunch spot for me and some of the other special adults in her life.  My mom and mommy 2 worked around here, and they suggested Nellie&#39;s.

Sounds good to me!  

I have been here before, but only to see bands play.  I had never had their food until that day.  I was definitely missing out!

The food was fabulous.  I like how many options you have to choose from for your side (salad, fries, waffle fries, mac n cheese, etc).  The waiter was honest and said that the regular fries are hit or miss, but the waffle fries are ALWAYS good.  Thanks for your honesty, sir.  I will take some!

I ordered the cheeseburger (made breakfast style with the egg, cheese, and bacon), and my sister ordered the pulled pork sandwich (although I am not sure it says it on the menu, but this comes with onion strings on it, and my sister is not an onion fan, so this wasn&#39;t an added bonus for her).

We did what we usually do, and we split our sandwiches in half.  This way, I get to try more that just my meal.  I love it that way! :)  But sandwiches were very good, but the pulled pork was VERY dry.  I asked for a side of BBQ to go with it.  So did my sister.  That livened it up a little.

The birthday girl DEVOURED her mac n cheese.  I have never seen her eat something so quickly!  It was amazing :)  And her kid&#39;s meal comes with a side of fries.  Carb-tastic :)

The food was great overall, but the service was definitely &#34;meh&#34;.  We were one of our server&#39;s only tables until around the time we left, and he wasn&#39;t very &#34;with&#34; it.  Whenever you would ask him for something, you would wait for a while for said item, and he would maybe come back with it.  Or he would come back again and say &#34;oh yeah, you were waiting for BBQ sauce&#34; or something along those lines.  We had to ask him three times to break a twenty so we could pay.  He was nice enough, but not very efficient.

But I will definitely be back!  My husband is practically chomping at the bit for their beer selection!  I won&#39;t be able to hold him back for much longer!!! ;)"

Not much has changed. They still have the giant stage/auditorium on the side for live music. We sat in the patio where it was a little bit quieter and had the wings for an appetizer.

For the entree, I had the chicken tacos. They were good portions and pretty good.

BATHROOM REVIEW 
  After several drinks, my bladder decided to swell up to the size of a peanut so I had numerous opportunities to check out and do my due diligence to of my bathroom review. It was OK -- just one urinal and one stall. The stall door was rickity with a latch for a lock and the urinal was a little crammed as it was right between a wall and the stall wall. I only wonder what happens when the place is bumpin&#39; and people need to piss... I guess have patience and hope for a short line. Sit or squat? I&#39;d squat."

We came in 4th place...not bad for a 2person team against teams of 8!

I&#39;ve had great experiences here before.  During Halloween in 2009 I won 3rd place in the costume contest.  Last Christmas-time, we held a Christmas party here which was a lot of fun.  They have good burgers and great wings.  I&#39;ve also had their mac &amp; cheese and some other foods that I can&#39;t remember....maybe I haven&#39;t had other foods.  Hmm...what is this place called again?  Oh yes, Durty Nellie&#39;s.  I&#39;ll be back."

However, I was introduced to Beer Fest at Durty Nellie&#39;s last year and am now a repeat customer!  The event is awesome and I highly recommend buying tickets quickly because they sell out fast.  

Fest aside, the bar generally is a nice space.  It&#39;s huge!  There are several rooms to move around, a great band space, a rooftop and a beer garden.  The food is pretty good and you get a lot for your buck.  Yes, it&#39;s in the suburbs, but it&#39;s literally steps from the Metra.  No excuse to drink and drive.  

Would I come to Palatine any month buy May?  No, but thanks, Nellie, for taking good care of the Chicago folks streaming up your way for a day of indulgence.  See you next year!"

Gone are the sticky floors, bar brawls and platic cups.The food and beer selection have grown more sophicated too. Best way to describe their daily specials is to post it here:

Monday: $4 Half-Pound Black Angus Beef Burgers (tops &amp; sides extra)

Tuesday: $5 Eats (special menu with items $5 or less)

Wednesday: Mexican themed food specials

Thursday: Buy-One-Get-One FREE Appetizers from 4pm-6pm. (This is only type of Happy Hour anyone will find any where in Chicagoland)

On Tuesday, I ordered their Steak and Bleu on Flatbread off their $5 menu with a Coke. It&#39;s served super thin and crispy. One of the best bar foods I&#39;ve ever tasted. Looking forward to coming back on another Tuesday just so I can enjoy it again!

The venue looks like it would be a lot of fun. I have a friend who follows the band 7th Heaven like a die hard groupie. I may have an excuse to come and check both out."

First, you can&#39;t find the place!  Believe it or not, this restaurant is in the basement (or lower level, as Ms. Stratton would prefer to call it) of the HARRIS BANK BMO building on Northwest Highway in Palatine.  As you can imagine, on a Sunday, there are no cars in the lot and no security at the front desk.  The door to the building was propped open by an orange cone!  Once you get in, it&#39;s like a scavenger hunt to find the restaurant and one will need to follow the aroma of soul food to arrive at the entrance!  We had to call a few times to figure out how to get in.  That&#39;s bad, really bad.

Second, be prepared to wait...at least 30 minutes for your food.  Once it comes along, it&#39;s really good and freshly prepared by Ms. Stratton.  But, check this out--on Sunday, they only serve brunch, at $19.95 per person, whereas lunch during the week is $11.95 per person.  By the time we ordered (Salmon Croquette--singular, there is not two but one when the order arrives and Chicken and Waffles, which according to my husband was good), 30 minutes had passed and two other tables were still waiting to be served.

Overall, the food was tasty, but lack of a prime location, wait staff and long pause for the food might prove to be too much for Kim Stratton to overcome.  She states that she&#39;s only been in business for 3 months, but if she wants to be around a year from now, my advice would be to move to a better location and hire a staff to assist and cut down on wait times.  Our bill was $70 with a 20% tip for a Sunday brunch, which is a overpriced given the service we experienced.  And did I mention that there were no menus available for patrons to look at, in order to learn what was being served, one has to wait for the one waitress on staff to come over and tell your party what&#39;s available for the day.  I kid you not.

I like to see entrepreneurs succeed, but Ms. Stratton will need to improve these issues to get me to return."

Being the sucker I was I parked and walked in to place my order.   While I was there placing my order the credit card system wasn&#39;t working. Also, the soda machine wasn&#39;t working so they had no beverages. Had to wait a long time for two taco salads even though I was the only customer.

Surprisingly I have not been to the Taco Bell after the remodel. The new cantina menu brought me back for another try. I tried the burrito which is significantly smaller than a chiptole burrito with very small amount of meat. The burrito bowel is equally small in comparison to the size of the bowel. Another major change is that the prices on value menu are significantly higher now. The food is so so, but the service was great. The cashier came over and dropped off the food after it was ready. I&#39;ll be back if I am hungry for a fourth meal.

Pro- quick fast food, relatively cheap mexican food

Con- Cantina bowel and  burrito super small and lacking flavor. Food is below average quality

Hidden deal- Check out facebook for coupon offers. Recently BOGO for cantina menu items"

I had no trouble parking my bicycle inside the establishment. There was plenty of room by the entrance so it didn&#39;t get in anyone&#39;s way.

The only criticism I have about this place is the sign posted in bold letters on the back door which warns their employees not to open that door after dark because their life depends upon following this rule. It compells me to wonder if something tragic happened already or maybe their employer is just being proactively paranoid.

Lucky for them because this is an embarrassment to Taco Bells the world over, and thats really saying something. I waited in the drive thru line for 36 minutes for TWO CHIPOTLE CHICKEN GRILLERS. After I ordered the two grillers, I proceeded to continue my order and requested for the loaded potatoes to also be thrown into my chipotle chicken grillers. I was then met with a quick and aggressive &#34;Hold on&#34; from the female employee who was taking my order. So I figured she was looking for the button to simply add the potatoes to my order, or she was new. NINE MINUTES GO BY. Finally, after I was calling out to her she finally responded, and again aggressively, she said, &#34;My bad, what did you want?&#34; (Are you fu**ing kidding me?!?!) So I went through the order AGAIN and pulled around to the window. When I pulled around, knowing the long line of cars waiting behind me, I see her leaning up against the order computer with her headset mic raised up away from her mouth as she&#39;s blatantly talking about gossip and drama with her other female co-workers!! Stupid high school drama that has nothing to do with her or her other coworkers doing their job, or getting my God Damn grillers! The drive through line is full, I&#39;ve now been waiting for over 20 minutes, and she&#39;s just standing there like she&#39;s in high school. Finally, again after having to get her attention, she continues to give me attitude when asking for my payment and handing me over my food, and to make things worse, THEY DIDN&#39;T EVEN WRAP MY DAMN GRILLER. IT WAS JUST LAYING ONTOP OF THE PLASTIC SHEET THEY SERVE IT ON INSIDE THE BAG!! When I opened it up to see if they even put potatoes in it, THEY WERE FUCKING STALE ASS POTATOES THAT WERE AS HARD AS A FU**CKING ROCK!!!! 

Who ever is the manager here should NOT just fire and re-hire new workers. They should quit and NEVER work at a fast food joint again. These terrible disrespectful girls working their should be fired, and they were so bad that I hope bad things happen to them so they grow the f**k up! Then! They should completely destroy this terrible fast food place and have it decimated from the face of the planet, and throw a party for the public to watch. Followed by completely deleting any public record of this place or these people having ever existed so the thousands that I&#39;m sure they have effected don&#39;t have to relive or rethink about their terrible memories they have encountered because of these terrible people, and so this terrible place becomes just an urban legend as the devils Taco Bell. This place is a Satan infested shit show of anger. Stay away."

Generally this TB does have slow service but this last time was even longer than usual, I assume it was because of the order 2 cars ahead of me. If that was the case, than they should have that person pull aside and wait just like every other fast food place does. And unfortunately once you are in the drive-thru line there is no escape. 
When I finally arrived to the window you would think they&#39;d have the food ready but no, took a few more minutes. No apology was given for the absurd amount of time I waited. I paid with my credit card and my card was given back to me with no receipt. I assumed it would be in the bag with the food. However, I got my food but still no receipt. I asked the TB employee for my receipt (I was intending on taking their survey to let them know how awful this place was) however the employee says &#34;Oh they might have thrown it away&#34;. Excuse me? What if I really needed that receipt, it is not up to you to determine that. I assume the receipts get &#34;thrown out&#34; so no one can take their survey  but good thing we have so many social media outlets to inform the people of terrible Taco Bells!"

Their staff at this location is friendly, fast, and well-trained!  They are really on their game here.  Also, there was one time when they forgot to give us one of our bags as we left the drivethru.  When we went back (about 4 mins later--we live that close!), they not only had that bag, but they made a whole new meal for us because they didn&#39;t want our food to be cold.  That was awesome.

I visited this TB at least 4 times a week when I was pregnant with my son.  It&#39;s ok to judge, I do, too.  But it was my pregnancy crack.  I think it has something to do with the sour cream..."

The food in our opinion has never been done quite as well as the other TB&#39;s being the fact that their burritos, quesadillas, crunchwrap supremes... etc  lack the same meat/cheese/filling quantities as those from other TB&#39;s and/or simply less flavor. Their frutista drinks are most often unavailable due to malfunctioning machines (or frozen as claimed), and when available the drinks are never made with the same flavor to ice ratio as other TB&#39;s. It seems that the general underlying issue with both food or drinks is the quality and inconsistency as compared to other TB restaurants. We actually drive further to another location for this reason."

Mexico uno is legit. Fash and friendly service, duh-lish-ous food, and simple, tequila filled beverages. The dining is small, and it&#39;s better that way. There are a few tables outside in the warmer months, too. 

I recommend the fish tacos. Did I mention them already? Grilled fish on corn tortillas with pico and guac. Drool. Wipe. Eat. Drool some more. Repeat. You get the idea.

Go there. Save me a seat, and order my margarita. Let&#39;s do this."

The staff is friendly and the service was definitely adequate. Prices are a little high but not too crazy. It&#39;s fairly in line with a sit down mexican restaurant. 

I got the combination plate. Beans n rice were good. Enchilada and tostada were dry and boring tasting. Taco completely fell apart and wasn&#39;t very good overall. The chimichanga my gf got was very boring and plain. The torta had too much bread and again was boring and not put together well. mini quesadillas were good, they add onion and what i think was a tomato sauce. It did, however, make me realize one of the common denominators in the bland tasting food was the tortilla. The tortilla and cheese just seemed boring for whatever reason. The onions really helped it pop.

All those aside, the tamales are possibly the best i have ever had. They were sooo good. They were featured on Chicago&#39;s Best and now i know why. Also, the pico de gallo they gave was also really good. We ended up putting it on the other stuff so it would ave flavor and not taste so bland. 

I will definitely be back for tamales and i&#39;ll probably give the fajitas a go. Hoping to up the stars on my review."

Comfortable inside atmosphere with a couple of tvs with the games on. They also have outdoor seating.  Great for a date night or with family and friends.

So we picked a table right by the door. The servers were walking in and out of the door because there were some people seated outside.  The place is one big room so it&#39;s not like people can&#39;t tell when a table gets occupied. But we sat and waited for about 5 minutes for menus.  I eventually just got up and walked over to the waiter stand to ask for them from the woman who told us we could sit anywhere.  I wasn&#39;t that hungry so I just got a ground beef burrito. It was fine.  My wife got chicken tacos and said there was gristle in with the chicken.  She left a good portion of them because they just weren&#39;t appetizing.

My hubs is from Mexico so seeing that they had Birria (goat stew) was the draw 

I had fish tacos - light breading in a Ranchero salsa - except the breading was soggy and fish was bland 

The goat stew was decent but lacked seasoning 

All food lacked &#34;sazon&#34; - authentic flavors 

The $8 guacamole was really small- again no flavor

Mediocre food. Maybe I should try something different on their menu. It was lunch time when I went and we were the only ones in there, along with a couple. It&#39;s in a good location, right in downtown palatine. I might give this place another shot one of these days. Service was pretty nice."

In the fairness, the guacamole wasn&#39;t hot enough for what I&#39;m used to, but now I know to ask for jalape√±o in the guacamole.  The warm chips and salsa was average, I&#39;m using Los Comales in Elgin as the standard.  The tamale was great, the beef taco average, the chicken tostada excellent, the beef enchilada average.  The rice and beans also average.  

What made this place amazing was the service.  The service was beyond compare.  I cannot stress this enough.  The value of the meal was great.  The food tastes like any average Mexican restaurant, but maybe because of the lame choices I made by choosing the combination platter.  Regardless, they have alcohol, which makes everything better.  

Overall, doesn&#39;t compare to salsa 17 in vibe, or Frontera Grill downtown as far as authenticity, not as great as Los Comales in Elgin, but definitely a solid Mexican restaurant.  Again, phenomenal service."

The burrito is pretty decent. The salsa is pretty dull and could use some more pop but when we asked for something more spicy - they delivered. All my friends got a Sangria which they then exclaimed was the &#34;best sangria they ever had&#34; so you can go for gold on that. 

The tacos looked lame but the quesadillas looked pretty legit. Its ok. Don&#39;t make a trip for it thought."

Maybe I&#39;m a little biased having just had a stint trying authentic grandma-in-the-kitchen Hispanic food in Pilsen, but this place just missed the mark for me.

The restaurant is conveniently located in downtown Palatine right near the railroad tracks and even has a small but nice outdoor seating area that seems like it would be lovely in the summer time.

Inside, the staff was friendly and it appears to be a family-run place which is always good to see.  The atmosphere was mostly uninspiring with an odd bar placement and definitly a little run down, but for me at least, not a major factor for restaurants.

The food was where it really kind of fell apart.  

I ordered a combination platter that came with a taco, an enchilada, and a tamale along with the standard rice and beans fare.  The chicken tacos were a bit chewy and underseasoned which was highlighted with some fairly dry tortillas.  the enchilada was average at best, again somewhat underseasoned and fairly bland.  The rice, again, was badly overcooked, dry, and mostly flavorless.

The tamale was very disappointing with badly overcooked pork along with what would have been a decent masa except that it was saturated with a red sauce that essentially seemed to be a can of upended Chef Boyardee minus the noodles.

If it had just been my meal, it could perhaps be chalked up to a small miss given the other ratings that seem to appear on here, but everyone at my table had a similar experience.  Given the number of options that are available, this one doesn&#39;t really seem worth a second shot."

Couldn&#39;t completely remember how we felt the first time we were here over a year ago, but since I generally remember the really bad places, we thought we&#39;d give it a try.  And I&#39;m seriously glad we did.

This is a hole-in-the-wall, and, for those of us that are willing to get past the exterior of some of these places, we know we, many times will find a gem.  That was completely true on the Saturday night when we showed up.  

The restaurant was nearly full, including the little bar that seats about 4 people.  We were seated without almost no delay.  Staff was extremely welcoming and quietly friendly.  They truly seemed glad we&#39;d chosen their restaurant to visit.  Ordered a pitcher of margaritas for the 3 of us and were immediately served thick, crispy chips and three different salsa/pico/enchilada-type sauce served warm. All were good.  Pico was a tad spicy but we like it that way.  After ordering we sat back and enjoyed the conversation.  Volume in the room was just right.  We could very easily carry on a conversation but there was enough ambient noise that our neighbors to the right of us couldn&#39;t hear what we were talking about.  So we ordered ANOTHER pitcher of REALLY GOOD margaritas.  Delicious.

I can&#39;t speak for the guys, but my fish tacos were amazing.  I&#39;m not a refried beans fan so our server graciously subbed extra rice.  It wasn&#39;t necessary as I hardly had room.  The tacos were very generously portioned with a lot of fish.  I love that.

Pricing seemed very fair.  We ate and drank our fill and never felt ignored.  Our water glasses were always full, our food came out quickly and we always had fresh chips.  In my opinion, I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better experience."

I had the combo plate (1 of everything, pretty much)- tamales are authentic, corn husked and soft. I had goat meat (birria) for my tacos. Tasted sharp, crazy tender. The barbacoa is also excellent, I had it on tostada I think. Be ready for a monster amount of food, I took some to go. 

I feel like the prices are more of a one $ than a two $$- it ran like 10$ for everything, tip inclusive. So, do be ready for that when you go- probably not a big, impressive date night place. But great for a comfy lunch or dinner with really good food!

Also, the large chicken soup is AWESOME! Big chunks of chicken, potatoes and carrots, served with sides of fresh cilantro, chopped onion, limes, and tortillas. The verde sauce is great, and the mole is tasty. It&#39;s our local Mexican joint, and I hope they stay open forever! Note - in summer there are outdoor tables, which is great.

I ordered the combination plate which had a taco, tostada, tamale, enchilada and you can pick your meats and have different meats in each dish! I wanted to get a taste for everything. The taco had great flavor and consistency. The tostada and tamale were very nicely cooked, though I could have tried to find a spicier salsa to top them with. The pico they bring out has some nice kick to it and was great for chips, but not as much for the actual food.

Enchilada was nicely sauced, and not too much so. Always a good choice.

I&#39;m not too familiar with the downtown area, but if this is indeed downtown, I&#39;m surprised how everything is so spaced out -- there&#39;s no one area of shops... but maybe I&#39;m wrong. Anywho, this place is unassuming so its easy to miss it as its not on a stand-alone building, but sandwiched in between buildings. The area has plenty of parking and we had no problem finding a spot right in front of the restaurant.

Inside, the place was decent sized. If I had to guess, it can probably fit about 50 people. The place has an open kitchen which is in the back. Bathrooms to the left and a tiny bar area on the right side near the front of the place. The service was pretty good -- they never allowed our water glasses to be empty and the free WARM chips and salsa was endless. The chips were salty and warm (thats what she said) and it came with pico de gallo and some kickin&#39; spicy green salsa.

We ordered the guac which came in a decent-sized oval shaped bowl. It was around $6 but it was tasty. I believe the price is reasonable and comparable to wherever you find guac. I ordered the shrimp fajitas, no cheese or sour cream and corn tortillas. The shrimp that came with this was HUGE! It should have been called prawn fajitas. It was extremely flavorful and the lady upon my request gave me a small bowl of hot peppers, carrots, and onions. Muy bueno!

BATHROOM REVIEW:
The bathroom as mentioned is near the back by the kitchen. It is a single stall bathroom. Upon entereing, it was a super bright bathroom. Mostly all white tiles with one hanging sink and a toilet. There was a big sign from the Palatine Department of Health informing how employees must wash their hand. Overall, pretty clean... and like I said, BRIGHT. sit or squat? I&#39;d sit, and maybe go tanning while I&#39;m at it ;-)"

If we hadn&#39;t spotted the salsa in the plastic bottle this would have only been a 2 star review

They have one bar with 7 seats and 1 TV (tuned to a replay of a Notre Dame football loss-very enjoyable!). The top shelf had 7 bottles of tequila. There are 3 suns (2 more on the pottery). 1 Mayan calendar. 2 peasant girls. 1 shirtless Aztec warrior. 1 ass pulling a cart. 1 matador facing a bull. 2 bathrooms. And a menu chock full of traditional Mexican foods. Our lunch here for two people of 5 tacos, 1 enchilada, 2 drinks, and free chips and pico was $20. You can&#39;t beat that!   This place also does carry out. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. Tacos can be had soft or crispy corn, or soft flour. Nice to know they cater to everyone. I had an avocado taco--which was slices with toppings. Interesting, and an option for vegetarians. I didn&#39;t find the pico too spicy--it&#39;s supposed to have jalape√±os, people! But I could see wimpy Northerners complaining--heck I was one of those not too long ago!  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll make a journey to eat here, but next time I&#39;m in the area, I&#39;ll be back! (And yes, they serve warm tomato sauce with their chips, it&#39;s not salsa, nor is it intended to be!)."

I had a chicken burrito and the wife had the tostadas dinner. Quality and quantity of food to price ratio was great! Very authentic Mexican restaurant. 

Like other reviewers, I was disappointed by the salsa. With the (warm) chips, they served something akin to cool tomato soup (pass), pico de gallo (so so), and a ketchup bottle with hotter sauce (better). When I asked for salsa verde (best), I got another bottle and despite being a little watered down, was what I used on the burrito  

I&#39;m no salsa expert, and have no set expectations, as I know restaurants vary on what they serve with chips, but nearly every place I&#39;ve been has something better tasting. With a salsa makeover, this place would definitely get my 5th star"

I love the bistec ala Mexicana.  My daughter likes the fajitas and my husband usually has the bistec as well or a burrito.  It&#39;s a lot of food for a reasonable price and the only reason I rate it a 4 and not 5 is that it is small and will fill up fast especially on the weekends.  I really wish they had a larger place.  SInce it&#39;s almost an hour away....we try to go at off peak times so that we know we&#39;ll get a table.

Fish is fresh, grilled (or saut√©ed hard to tell) and taste excellent. The chicken soup entree is hearty and clearly homemade. Tacos and tostadas are good with chicken being a highlight. I agree with some other reviewers that the pico is too small and its spicy (which I like). The other sauce provided is just straight tomato sauce (really we asked!). Try the sauce in the squeeze bottle which I think is excellent."

Very steamy cup of Tomato Soup - I think it&#39;s soup, it wasn&#39;t spicy to be hot sauce

It&#39;s a nice family restaurant. Good smiley service and fast. I got the Verde Enchiladas. Typically you can pick from pork, chicken and beef. Since there were three rolls, I ended up getting one of each. If I had to pick, the pork is the winner for me, it&#39;s moist and nicely seasoned. Side of rice and beans - delish!

There&#39;s specials on the blackboard priced pretty well at around $7.95 for entrees. Much better than the other Mexican chain place in the Deer Park Town Center if you want good food and don&#39;t care for atmosphere, better to come down here instead."

Salsa comes out and it&#39;s just ok.  Actually it&#39;s not salsa, it&#39;s pico de gallo.  No spice whatsoever (not a good sign either).  I order the al pastor tacos.  For those who don&#39;t know, al pastor is a marinated pork that has several spices and takes at least a day to marinade.  The pastor was rather flavorless (as were my wife&#39;s fajitas), compared to other authentic taquerias that I&#39;ve been too.  The service was fine.  The problem (with most of suburbia, that is) here is that they&#39;ve been forced to dumb down the flavor and the spice because that&#39;s what white people can handle and (even worse), that what many folks think is &#39;authentic&#39;.  Sadly, I think the cooks are holding back just to appease the mass, bland suburbanites who don&#39;t know any better.

It&#39;s evident that they know their food isn&#39;t spicy whatsoever, because there is a shaker of crushed red pepper on every table.  I&#39;ve never seen that in a Mexican restaurant before.

After my GPS gave me decent directions I arrived and its kinda hidden in the corner its on. I had to drive around twice before I realized it was immediately on your right after turning onto the street. Parallel parking? No thanks. Luckily it wasn&#39;t too busy so I just slid right in. Now, I know the little business in palatine bunch together but I dont think the sign was even illuminated! Either way it was hard to make out the restaurants name. I DIGRESS!

So onto the food. I called in an order and they said it would be ten minutes. Not bad I&#39;d say. I arrived right when they passed it through the kitchen to be picked up. I got the tostadas regular and an order of chips with guac. It was around $12 for the dinner portion which I think was affordable. It came with three tostadas, beans, and rice. I usually NEVER eat beans and rice because I&#39;m not a huge fan of either. But OMG these were some of the best beans I&#39;ve EVER had, and the rice was cooked perfectly. They dump them together in the take out box so they mix and make a perfect little marriage of deliciousness. The beef on the tostadas was very good, spiced perfectly and the portion was HUGE. I hadn&#39;t eaten all day and managed to wolf down half the food before stopping to enjoy my usually dreaded beans. But man, do I wish I&#39;d paid more attention to them in the beginning! I&#39;m curious to try some other food from here, particularly the Chiles Rellenos. 

The staff was also super nice. And the prices are pretty good. Obviously not a big restaurant like La Hacienda but I think the food spoke for itself! I need more beans next time!!! Also the guac was on point! It wasn&#39;t too cilantro-y and had fresh tomatoes."

I don&#39;t know if my palate has changed, or if my taste buds were off because I am a bit sick, but I really enjoyed all the food here.

The tom yum soup with chicken wasn&#39;t too spicy (in fact, I felt it was hardly spicy at all).  

The crazy noodles were really hyped up on Yelp, so I ordered them... but with some trepidation because the photo and description in the menu honestly didn&#39;t look that appealing...  BUT THEY WERE FREAKIN&#39; DELICIOUS!!!  

I ordered it with chicken, and it came on a ginormous platter with huge pieces of chicken amidst lots of thick wide rice noodles.

We shared an order of Mongolian beef noodle, which was artfully presented on a bed of crispy noodles, sweet pepper, onion and a wonderful sauce. It came with a side of cooked rice. That too was a winner. And topping if off I tried their lemon ginger tea, which was a commercial teabag but went really well with the Asian food.

The place is very quiet; a water cascade gently gurgles in the corner. Service was most pleasant and personable. The interior is clean and decorated in an attractive Thai motif, and the tables and settings employ linens and china. Prices are very modest for food of that quality and eye appeal.

It&#39;s a nice place with good decor and friendly service. There was just one lady going around and getting orders and I guess only one chef inside. We got the daily lunch special (11 am to 3pm on all days), which includes one entree, one soup and one appetizer. I was detoxing on my meat consumption, so I went full veggie mode.

So, there was a veggie soup, which was so-so. I got the veggie roll, which was yummy, deep fried with a veggie/peanut stuffing, so that was a tad sweet but the Peanut sauce on the side was to die for, super awesome. I got the Pad thai with Tofu and it was good. I would highly recommend this place and it was really affordable, like $8 for the entire lunch special."

I have ordered delivery from here twice. They do deliver fast, which is why they got the second star.

First time I had delivery from here I got raw wonton in EVERY crab ragoon. It sucked because the filling was great. I will upload a photo below. I also asked for extra hot sauce with every order, I got two... Ugh. Four people and only two tiny hot sauces.

The second time...
I made sure to write on the order form to make sure the crab ragoon was cooked throughly, and thankfully it was. I also asked for five hot sauces since my friend and I were sharing and we had our kids. Not to mention we had ordered two of the entrees at a &#34;medium&#34; spice level.

So instead of giving us the five hot sauces on the side, we received three.... Really!? And the &#34;medium&#34; dishes were just as spicy as the &#34;hot&#34; ones. One friend and two children were not able to eat because of this! So had to order delivery from another location!

So instead of giving us the extra hot sauce, they decided to amp up the spice level in the dishes!? Really?

The only food item I disliked (because I LOVE SPICY) were the spring rolls.. Wth are they rolled in?! I&#39;ve never seen them made that way!!!

Let&#39;s just say we will NOT be ordering from this place again. Great taste doesn&#39;t just do it for me. Customer service people!"

The veg egg rolls I started with as an appetizer were just a very off flavor combination. Peanut Butter? I dunno, to me it just did not blend all that well, but other might find this delicious. Luckily, everything else I had was fantastic!

The Tom Yum chicken soup was sensational, nice and spicy and with a very bold and lovely flavor profile. Next time I order I will likely order a large portion of this as my meal I liked it so much. 

The &#34;Crazy&#34; noodle entree was also fantastic. Very fresh ingredients, and nice and spicy (they allow you to choose the level of spiciness you desire). All in all, this was a very good option for thai food that I am sure to order from again."

I always have chicken pad Thai when I come here tonight though I decided to try the crazy noodles as recommended by another yelper and let me tell you it was the best dish I&#39;ve had only differences I had them add extra beans sprouts as I like the  extra crunch.
I paired it with the finger size egg rolls which I&#39;ve had before but were way way too crispy so I have them cook him a little less still crispy but not overly crunchy and a cucumber salad.  
Found my new favorite dish here still believe they are five star at cheap prices."

Pad Thai - 3 star - not the best by any means, the noodles lack the texture one expects in good Pad Thai, a thicker snappy noodle.  The sauce could use a lot more peanut taste as well

Green Curry - 4 star - originally at the very top of where I would say my hotness level is, I like spicy but there&#39;s a limit to where it just burns for far too long to be enjoyable.  This was at the top of that.  It was a good spicy though, not a our one, a sweet one with great flavor.  Coconut milk was added later to bring down the level to a much more enjoyable one.  I wish there was something more in the curry, I feel it wasn&#39;t complete with the eggplant, bamboo, chicken, and green peppers. Not sure why.  I loved having the curry and rice straight up though, I just need something textually different so it&#39;s not just all mush.

Service - 5 star - The server made sure everything was perfect for us, I didn&#39;t have the heart to complain about the Pad Thai, they weren&#39;t that bad.  She even had them add extra coconut milk to the green curry to bring the spiciness down."

Thai food delivery to the rescue!!

I knew I&#39;d be holed up for a while, what with the wayward weather conditions, being under the weather and absolutely no know-how of the proper way to jump start a hybrid car, so I decided to order a few days worth of food that totaled $60 because fatty Candi loves her Thai food. 

The delivery took less than the stated hour and both the woman on the phone and the man who delivered the food were friendly as can be and *almost* made me wish I&#39;d left my place to actually visit Taste of Thai and spend more time with it&#39;s fine people. 

At first sight, I thought my Spicy Basil Tofu portion was kinda small... and then I ate and ate and ate and ate, but the bowl never got any less empty. I think it was just packed really tightly because the portion that would normally last me 3/4 of a meal lasted for 1.5 meals. Saaaaweeet! Oh, and spicy! I like mine extra spicy and Taste of Thai did a nice job with actually making the dish spicy. The pad see ew was decent, not as good as Jaded Thai&#39;s, but I don&#39;t know anywhere that does pad see ew quite as well as JT. 

One thing worth noting is that they went out of their way to clarify and make sure when I asked for dishes with tofu if I wanted them the standard vegetarian or vegan. It was nice just to have a place understand the difference because even though I&#39;m not vegan, I&#39;ve encountered plenty of places that even when &#39;no-meat&#39; is specified, they don&#39;t always deliver on that. I also ordered the tom yum tofu (vegan) as I heard ToT had some great tom yum, but I thought it fell pretty flat. Perhaps the tom yum with meat is a bit livelier because the veg version was really watery, almost flavorless and the chunks of tomato in it were obnoxiously large and almost too big to fit in your mouth as one bite. I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I prefer not to have to unhinge my jaw when I menage. 

I certainly won&#39;t be stranger to Taste of Thai&#39;s delicious and delivering ways, and perhaps when the weather warms up I&#39;ll even stop in for a full service visit."

For entrees:
Cashew nut chicken, it was fairly good, not spicy at all. 
Pad Thai, if your used to Pad Thai this is not what you might be normally used to. It lacked any peanut flavor and they used way to much fish sauce,  it had a very distinct fishy taste.
Pad Woonsen. We tried this on a whim never having had it before it was truly enjoyable I would recommend this as something to try."

I am a huge fan of thai food and I am very picky when it comes to pad thai. I have tried the drunken noodles here and it is not the best, but their pad thai is phenomenal. Just wish they would make it a tad bit spicier but when you ask them to make it spicy, they give you sweet chili sauce on the side which you should never use. Ruins the taste. I also like their thai ice tea and their sticky rice for the desert. HIGHLY recommended for pad thai.  I think they make most of their business through delivery.

Poor beef quality. Pale, grainy beef used for their dishes. I&#39;d rather pay more for my dish than get that mediocre stuff. 

Poorly balanced dishes. My panang curry lunch special had a very small amount of the curry broth. Overabundance of chicken. A sprinkle of peas. that was it.

Pad thai.  I hoped this would shine, since this was the most commented on. I might have been spoiled by Chicago restaurants, but.... this was on the very wet side. Wasn&#39;t bad, but nothing special either.  Sparse on veggies as well- cabbage, carrots, etc.

I ordered sticky rice as a dessert, requested it with banana since mango was out of season. Didn&#39;t get any banana. It was also REALLY small. There was maybe a few red beans scattered in it...... but i wouldn&#39;t have even bothered, had I known otherwise.

Really, nothing I got was bad, but it still makes it hard for me to recommend it. didn&#39;t get any utensils with my delivery order, either (after requesting utensils and chopsticks). Lunch specials came with free appetizers- i ordered spring rolls for each... and rather than separate the spring roll with each container, they were all wrapped and packaged with the pad thai.

I dunno. just not consistent. not professional. better than fast food, but definitely not worth going out of my way for unless I was desperate for an inkling of what good thai food really should be.  =\ i like supporting the small businesses. i just can&#39;t  say that this is a great one."

Lunch prices start at $7 and come with a small appetizer and soup of the day.  I ordered Panang Curry with Chicken.  The appetizer was two small crab rangoon.  Both of these dishes were pretty good, but tiny portions.  

The soup of the day was a tasteless chicken with rice.  I had a sore throat and was craving something hot to warm me up and make me feel better, so I also ordered a cup of Tom Yum soup.  A cup was $5 and it was literally half mushrooms.  I hate mushrooms.  I usually ask for no mushrooms, but the menu said the soup had straw mushrooms which I don&#39;t mind.  Low and behold, it had both... By the time I picked out all the mushrooms, my bowl was half empty... even my mushroom loving lunch date was laughing at the ridiculous amount of mushrooms in my soup... she wouldn&#39;t even eat them.  She also complained that her chicken dish was mostly onions... I say Taste of Thai is trying to cut costs!

The service was friendly and the food came out quickly, but it was difficult to get the attention of the server at times.  She also took forever to come and get our order.  You would think places would understand that at lunch people need to get back to work!

There was also a lady here talking loudly with her phone on speaker at the table next to us... then when she finished she let her kid play games with the sound on as loud as it goes... talk about annoying!"

Taste of Thai is our hands down favorite Thai place in Chicago.  While the ambiance isn&#39;t the greatest, that&#39;s its only major flaw.  It&#39;s a family owned restaurant and they work harder than any other place I have seen.  It is a consideration for Friday night date night every week whether the date night consists of just me and my wife or the two of us and our three boys.

Most people agree that a measuring stick for a good Thai restaurant is there Pad Thai.  ToT&#39;s is the best in Chicago.  That&#39;s what I order 9 out if 10 times we go.  The pad see ew and basil chicken are amazing too!  My youngest enjoys the baby egg rolls.

Over the past 7 years that we have been frequenting this restaurant, I can&#39;t remember  one time leaving not being completely satisfied. Even their lunch specials are amazing.  I don&#39;t think the portions are that much smaller, and you get the soup of the day and a choice of appetizer.  I leave an extra tip because I feel bad that the bill for two of us is $15 based on all that we were given!  The only negative for the lunch menu is that pad see ew isn&#39;t available."

My Pad Se Iew, however, was just average. It wasn&#39;t bad by any means, just wasn&#39;t good enough that I&#39;d go out of my way to come back here again.

Crab rangoons were delicious. Some of the best I had, although I wish the sauce they gave with it wasn&#39;t so sweet, but overall 5 out of 5. Amazing!

Vietnam spring rolls- meh. I came from Mn and have fallen on love with Vietnamese food and these felt like they were made the day before.weird sauce, should be peanut sauce and I got some weird runny brown sauce. These we&#39;re 3 out if 5 at best

Beef and broccoli- very very good and super fresh and light! I&#39;d say one of the best meals and you don&#39;t have to feel guilty eating it. Recommended 4.5/5

Pad thai- I got chicken and it was good. Way too noodily not enough protein. Sauce was thick and cooked into noodles so there&#39;s really no &#34;sauce&#34;. I like Pad Thai that rides the middle and being a little wet. I remember having to grab a jug of water on my second plate. Good though just different- 4/5


Overall very fresh and never felt guilty for eating it and the left overs. Crab rangoons are delicious and are free if you order on grub hub"

I have always loved the small restaurant atmosphere, the attention to detail with their dishes, the excellent service, and fair prices. I don&#39;t get out there as often these days, but made a trip there yesterday. It seems that some changes have happened - for example, the peanut sauce served with the egg rolls is thinner and less flavorful. I ordered the basil fried rice with chicken, and while delicious, wasn&#39;t bursting with flavor like the last time I went. I still love Taste of Thai, but I feel nostalgic for the way it was years ago."

I went here for lunch with a co-worker and it came with a soup, an appetizer, and the main course. The amount of food is about average for the $9 I paid for lunch. I ended up getting Pad Thai. 

The Pad Thai was pretty bland and there wasn&#39;t much flavor in any of it. I&#39;d give it 2 out of 5 stars. 
The soup that they served before hand was the best. It was very flavorful with sprouts and some other vegetables in it and some small strips of chicken. My hunch in why it tasted good was that they add MSG into it. I&#39;d give it 4 out of 5 stars. 
The spring roll appetizer wasn&#39;t what I expected at all. It was a flat noodle type surrounding with some random pieces of meat and veggies in the center. But it didn&#39;t taste like anything. I&#39;d give it 1 out of 5 stars.

Overall, the service was alright, nothing spectacular. They don&#39;t come around when they are needed per se but it&#39;s not like they are rude."

The restaurant is very clean, and the service is warm and friendly. For me, though, the food was merely average. (I&#39;m totally spoiled living in Atlanta, where there are many excellent Thai restaurants nearby.)

My brother recommended the crab rangoon appetizer, and it was pretty good: crispy/crunchy on the outside and oozing delicious melty crab goodness on the inside. The sweet and sour sauce served on the side was the basic, run-of-the-mill stuff you&#39;d find in any Chinese takeout order. The spring rolls, on the other hand, were tasteless and dry, and somehow the soy-based dipping sauce only managed to accentuate their blandness. 

Based on the other Yelpers, I should have tried the Pad Thai, but instead opted for the crazy noodle dish, which was absolutely fine, but not quite spicy enough for me. The portion is large, so be prepared for leftovers.  My brother&#39;s absolute favorite is the drunken noodle dish. He tried to explain it to me-- how the noodles are soft yet crunchy and how they just pop in your mouth with all kinds of flavor goodness. I didn&#39;t quite believe him, but then I had a bite. He was, in fact, correct. An oddly intriguing, yet quite good dish I&#39;ve not seen elsewhere.

Best of all, you won&#39;t go broke at this place, and there&#39;s plenty of options on the menu. Just leave any high expectations of fine dining at home."

Alas, no.  It didn&#39;t happen that way.  The delivery person was lost for 40 minutes, despite the written directions I provided when placing my online order &amp; the 3 phone calls we exchanged to provide clarification.  (It&#39;s doubly curious since I&#39;m staying at a major hotel within a few miles of the restaurant.)

Sadly, the long wait was not worth it.  I found the food somewhat disappointing.

The Tom Yum Soup was greasy.  I used several Kleenex to scoop the grease off.  (I eat street food in the US and other countries, so I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m terribly picky about grease.)  It also had more mushrooms than any version of TYS I&#39;ve seen before.  So, for those that are lovers of red greasy mushroom broth (and not much else in the soup), this may be a match. :)

The &#34;fresh&#34; spring rolls tasted like they&#39;d been sitting in a glass display case all day.  I don&#39;t know what they were rolled in, but it reminded me a little of thick paper.  I&#39;m not sure how peanut sauce can be unappealing, but somehow it was.  There wasn&#39;t anything that I ordered that I enjoyed, unfortunately.

However, 2 big stars for the managers being very nice &amp; quickly discounting my order for the late delivery -- and thus, lukewarm soup &amp; lukewarm &#34;fresh&#34; spring rolls.  Having worked in a service role, I really dislike having to advocate for myself as a customer.  These managers were clearly very service-oriented -- which is one reason I would maybe consider trying different dishes IN the restaurant (no more delivery) if I lived in town."

The lunch special came with soup, which was some kind of chicken soup (and was pretty sad) and the spring rolls (which weren&#39;t fantastic but were okay). I ordered the Pad Woo Sen, while my boyfriend had the chicken cashew dish. Both were pretty good, and while it hasn&#39;t been our favorite Thai place so far, it is definitely good. 

The service was very attentive. When I asked for tofu as my meat, she assumed I was a vegetarian and told me about a substitute for the soup and asked if I wanted my lunch without egg, and while I&#39;m not a vegetarian (I just really like tofu, don&#39;t judge) I appreciate that it is something that they check for. 

My only reservation is that when we were in there, we only saw white people. Of course, perhaps we came in at the wrong time, but its always a good sign when actual Thai people eat at Thai places.

I can&#39;t speak for the dining room experience though, since I don&#39;t eat in. 

I almost always get some type of fried rice dish along with Tom Yum soup and/or egg rolls, and have never been disappointed with those. They do tend to overcook the pork and the beef a bit IMO, but they are good with seasoning so that helps. And the meat has never been uneatable. The regular tempura was too greasy though, I will not order that again. The calamari tempura was very good however.  The Pad Khee Mao was also a bit greasy, so I&#39;m not sure if all their food is well prepared.

To get 5 stars from me, everything about a place has to be top-notch. The service. The cleanliness. And of course, the food. At Taste of Thai, everything was. A fresh rose at every table. A soothing fountain in the background. Muted lighting. Nice.

The husband and I started with the Thai Platter. Sweet baby Jesus, that was almost a meal by itself. Chicken satay, pork satay, egg rolls, baby egg rolls, fresh spring rolls, mee krob, crab rangoon, golden triangles, pot stickers, and silk purses. Elegantly presented and quickly decimated. 

I had to try the Tom Yum soup. Very generous chicken breast, tangy flavor. Yum is right! 

This would have been the perfect time to stop as my stomach was already giving me plenty of  &#34;me full&#34; signals. But since gluttony is my favorite sin, and Pad Thai my favorite dish, I plundered on. 

I know a previous review said that their Pad Thai was soggy and the sauce was just &#34;meh&#34;. I have to say that this was the best Pad Thai that I have eaten since moving to the burbs. THE BEST. Again, very generous with the chicken breast and the perfect blend of sauce, noodles, bean sprouts and peanuts. I ate half and declared I would take the other half home. 

I then spent 20 minutes of &#34;baby-stepping&#34; until the last half was gone. I desperately wanted to undo the button of my jeans because I couldn&#39;t breathe but there were other patrons in there and I didn&#39;t want to embarrass myself. 

Don&#39;t ask me how I managed to also eat banana eggrolls for dessert. But I did. 

The husband had Thai fried chicken and banana sticky rice. He was not a fan of Thai food until dining here. Even he raved about everything, including the cute, efficient, and very friendly waitress. 

Ladies, have you ever been SO full that you not only had to undo the button of your pants but your bra as well? I should be ashamed, but I&#39;m not. 

There will be no turkey tomorrow stuffed as well as I am tonight. Word."

I can&#39;t believe my basil beef was actually basil chicken and at that ground chicken. I called back to inquire about this mystery meat and whomever answered the phone argued me down that the person calling said chicken... I guess I got used to quality Chicago loop Thai food. My coworkers dish actually had chicken pieces so I am really confused as to why they used ground chicken in my dish... My coworkers dish also had beef and the color was as pale as the chicken...my coworkers and I will NEVER order again from this place because of nasty food and nastier service

I ordered take out from here several times and it has just declined in quality since the first time I&#39;ve ordered.  Yesterday was the final straw and I will never order from there again.  I placed the order on grub hub and it was great because I got to redeem a coupon.  The wait time was 45 minutes according to grub hub but the food didn&#39;t show up for an hour later.  At that point I could&#39;ve drove there dined in an paid my check.  Once the food came we ordered crab rangoon and wings as appetizers and both of the containers were opened.  All the appetizers were cold!!  I had to reheat them and as I attempted to eat a chicken wing the drummie wing broke in half.  Gross.  Moved on the my Pad Se Iew..........the beef looked really poor quality and the portion was really small.  It didn&#39;t matter since I barely touched the stuff after a few bites. The noodles were over done and there was really no sauce or flavor.  Everything just tasted like grease and the consistency of the noodles felt like I was eating fat.  After a few bites and I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  My friend got the pineapple friend rice with chicken and there was a weird after taste.  Definitely not worth the wait :(

This was my third or fourth time here and every time has been very good. This time was no different.

Food is good, but they have a limited kitchen, so be aware before heading here looking for gourmet Italian food.  They have a great deli selection as well as solid thin crust pizza to choose from. Although, everything that I have had here has been good. 

They have a solid selection of craft beer on draft and various wines to choose from. They also have bottles of beer to choose from. I definitely feel like the beer list is more substantial than the wine list. They also sell wine and beer to go. 

Overall, this place is good place to go and unwind and enjoy a glass of wine or pint of beer after work or late evening around downtown Arlington Heights. I&#39;ll definitely keep coming back for the rotating craft beers and reasonably priced food."

For starters, got the bar board. It was a nice assortment of meats and cheeses with olives and baguettes. Everything tasted well. I wanted to try an oktoberfest beer. They didn&#39;t have it but offered me an amber ale that was good too.

My wife got a turkey sub. They accidentally brought her out an Italian sub so they let her keep it &amp; gave her a turkey sub for free! Great customer service! For dessert we tried the flourless chocolate cake. I&#39;m typically not huge on gluten free stuff but it was really good! Very dense, moist and sweet! A well worth it, low-carb dessert.

They have a phenomenal wine and beer selection accompanied with great customer service. I plan to try one of their up coming wine tastings!"

We ordered a cheese plate appetizer and it was so delicious. The waitress was super sweet and she helped guide us through the menu and different pairings. We knew we each wanted our own pizzas and she helped us pick out two distinct flavors so we got a good mix.

I have passed by here a few times in the evening, and it is crazy packed. Luckily we came during the day so it was nice and quiet and we had space to move and breathe.

This place is a bunch of things in one. It&#39;s a beer/wine tasting bar. It&#39;s a market where you can buy wine, beer, baked goods, cheese, subs, pastas and some other delights to go. It&#39;s also a restaurant of sorts because everything that you can buy to go, you can also eat here. I did a little partaking in all of the above.

I wasn&#39;t expecting them to have so many beers on tap! They have a decent amount of rotating local drafts that you can try. They of course, also have a nice list of red and white wines for you to try. I had a glass of wine and beer, and both were delicious. We also shared the cheese plate and the buffalo pizza. Cheese plate was awesome - 4 different kinds of cheese, 2 different kinds of olives, bread, apricot jam, almonds, dried apricots, and a strawberry. I would definitely get that again. The pizza, I wasn&#39;t so impressed with. It lacked flavor overall. It is small, (about the size of a tortilla), so keep that in mind.

I also ordered a piece of carrot cake to go. It was very good, but so expensive!! For one piece it was $7. Woah. It was good...but that&#39;s a little much. My friend ordered a few bakery items to go and she was surprised at the bill as well.

The service was so-so. I can tell that they have their regulars, and they are super nice people. There were a few times we were waiting for someone to come buy and order another drink. They were good about letting us try the wine/beer before we ordered it, and were very helpful as far as finding something we would like.

I would come back for a drink and the cheese plate again. I like the atmosphere, and it&#39;s a nice addition to the area."

TMWS was 4th on the list. I clicked on it because I was intrigued at the fact that it said wine shop but it showed up as a request for restaurants. So clicked on it and it&#39;s history from there. I went, I visited and I loved it.

Its a small space across the street from Jewel. It has a great collection of wines for purchase on the right side and the restaurant is located to the right of the door. My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered the sangria and the montepulciano wine. Both were amazing we had two of each. For food we had the conga salad (i think that&#39;s what it was called) and the chicken cobb pizza. I thought the pizza was good but nothing amazing. I kind of wish I had ordered a different one. The salad though! Holly cow. First of all its not a salad. Its a concuction of goat cheese nuts pesto spread and olives. Oh and the bread that comes with it?? Delicious.

The only reason I deducted the star was due to the pizza and the service. It was a bit scattered. There were 3 bartenders in the place (or were there? I am not sure). One could have done the job if they have a sense of what hospitality is but I ain&#39;t mad, I had a great experience.

The outdoor seating was full and just about full inside including the tables and the bar. The hostess greeted and seated at only 2 seats left, on stools to the side. This worked out for my friend &amp; I since we were catching up and were able to hear each other. 

We ordered the margarita pizza and the gnocchi which came in a butter sauce We asked for vodka sauce but they didn&#39;t have. Our server did offer us pestos on the side, which we agreed to. The butter sauce would be more suitable as a dipping sauce with bread but didn&#39;t suffice to stand alone as a flavorful sauce coating the pasta. The pizza was mediocre with the basil and diced tomatoes not being baked in so they would fall off onto plate. 

We had to try flagging down our server for several minutes to get our bill processed. It shouldn&#39;t take that much time and effort. The meal and service left much to be desired."

Although I rarely go out for Italian food, since it&#39;s so easy to make at home, Tuscan Market is well worth making an exception.  

I had the Asiago Stuffed Gnocchi, which melted in my mouth.  When I saw other food coming out of the kitchen, everything looked delicious.  The menu is mostly pasta and pizza, and I look forward to coming back to try more dishes.

The beer &amp; wine menu makes it tough to choose!  I had a St. Ambroise Apricot Wheat and later, at the server&#39;s recommendation, a Hell or High Watermelon - both awesome summer brews.

Tuscan Market is part market, part restaurant.  It looks as though you can purchase a bottle of wine on the premises to drink with your meal or take it to go.

Even on weekdays, this place fills up fast.  It was bustling when we were here on a Thursday at 6:30 p.m., and it was packed by the time we left.

Although I really wanted to try one of their many creative pizza&#39;s, it was just going to take too long. 30+ to prepare the pizza. If I wasn&#39;t on my lunch break, I would have tried one. Instead I went with their Wine Bar Cheese Boards. Quick, easy, and extremely delightful! Nothing goes better with cheese, than a glass of wine! I went with an Argentinian wine, Cigar Box Malbec.

Let&#39;s start by saying the customer service is very good. At every point we were catered to from ordering our wine, appetizer and taking our time to figure out dinner. 

Our pick for wine today was Sexual Chocolate. Yes, we thought the reference to Coming to America was funny. It was between that and Ball Buster. 

We ordered The Bar Board which was a really nice start. Pizza was The Goatee with sun dried tomato pesto, mozzarella goat cheese and topped with fresh spinach and tomato pesto drizzle. We really enjoyed the flavor and the crust.

We plan to finish with the Chocolate Tower Cake... But when we get home. Super stuffed! 

This was a great experience and look forward to coming back. We&#39;ll be sure to try the Ball Busters wine. :)

The wine is decently priced and there are quite a few different selections, so if you just come here for some wine and maybe a meat and cheese board, it can be worth your while. It might get a little pricey though, as the food is not exactly the best priced. This can be painful when you are planning to buy a few glasses of wine or a bottle. 

I was not impressed by the food I got here. Both times I have come to this place I was simply underwhelmed by what I had gotten. I don&#39;t know if I just picked the wrong dishes or what, but I just wasn&#39;t a fan. The food doesn&#39;t completely match the &#39;wine bar&#39; feel so it just seems slightly confused to me. I don&#39;t know....maybe I&#39;m picky about my food genres. 

Also, as note, have your ID on hand before you walk in at night, they card right when you step in the door...which I find slightly obnoxious, honestly. The place is too small to have people jamming right in the doorway getting carded. 

Another note: there is very little seating room here. You will most likely be standing for quite a sum of time, so if someone in your party has aching joints or an injury (hey, maybe you are bringing your Mother or Grandma here!) then this could get a little painful for them."

It was my turn to choose so I chose Tuscan Market on November 4th. 

First off, the menus are in a basket and one must go to the counter to order. The young man behind the counter took our orders: A Tuscan Sub for me, from the &#34;cold&#34; menu and a Turkey Paninni from the &#34;hot&#34; menu for my friend. 

What each of us got was a Hot Italian Beef Sandwich for me and a Cold Turkey Sub for my friend. Both orders were completely different than ordered. 

The woman who brought the plates to the table also added that she &#34;wasn&#39;t going to charge us for the extras because it was a learning experience for us.&#34; WHAT EXTRAS? We would have insisted on getting what we originally ordered but didn&#39;t want to wait around to get the replacement food.

If they can&#39;t get the orders right for the only two people in the store at the time, how can they handle orders when more than two are there?"

It&#39;s a small place downtown right near the train, and it has such a cozy atmosphere. The staff are all ridiculously friendly, and they have a huge craft beer selection, as well as quality wine. The cheese and meat plates are both a great snack (with huge portions to validate the price) and they have a variety of specialty pizzas that are delicious. It can get crowded though, so seating sometimes becomes a problem. 

It is also a marketplace where they sell a huge variety of wine, beer and wine-related products."

The pizzas are good but for heavens sake i beg you to take pasta off the menu.   By microwaving pasta entrees while we watch and then they are served moderately warm is not appealing.   Also ordered the pizza with pear that had 3 pear slices on one piece of pizza.   10+ staff for 12-20 tables and the service tonight was way off.   
By the way, an open kitchen means everyone can see sanitation practices.  Training is needed here.    I probably would come back in hopes this local spot can work out these kinks.
I would suggest a clear branding statement.  Baseball jerseys and everyone wears their own pants looks like you should serve hotdogs.  What is Tuscan market?  Who is managing and who is doing dishes."

It just didn&#39;t happen. Things didn&#39;t seem right from the beginning. The staff seemed very stressed and running around giving us the uneasy feeling of them being understaffed. However, the establishment was maybe 2/3 to its capacity and hardly seemed &#34;busy&#34;. Given what seemed to be a situation difficult to handle for the staff we gave the servers the benefit of the doubt and generously tolerated the &#34;lack of attention&#34;. After sitting down and relaxing over some wine (server indeed knew their wine selection), we ordered an appetizer and it was delicious. Following the appetizer we learned that they ran out of ice which prompted me to not order my usual soda with my main meal as I don&#39;t like it without ice. The excuse as to why they ran out of ice was hardly acceptable. &#34;It was hot today&#34;. Regardless, we pressed on. After waiting slightly over an hour for our dinner order (pasta and some sauce - hardly complicated), we decided to call it quits and leave without eating after the waiter asked us again what it is we wanted for dinner completely absent of the knowledge of what we ordered an hour ago. They clearly have an operational problem. Our waiter/bartender was continually running outside for long periods of time catering to tables on their patio which clearly could have been handled more efficiently with separation of duties having an outdoor server, and an indoor server. A simple case of what seemed to be an orchestra of fine musicians (they know their wine and are genuinely friendly), but are playing the music at different tempos. I blame the conductor. Not sure we will go back. If we do, I will certainly update my review with our follow-up experience."

We ate outside (only 3 tables, so only a few get to do this), and the service was good.  The beer list is excellent - lots of unique choices.  Many were high alcohol content so watch out.  We both ordered pasta dishes and they were very good.  At first it looks like waaayyy too much food, but the plate was a LOT of sauce, which made it look like more food.  We both finished our meals no problem.  If you are looking for a Magiano&#39;s size portion this is not it.  Nothing wrong with that, just sayin.  We will go back."

Great atmosphere and food. We went once and have been back 3 times in the last 2 weeks. We are so happy we found our new spot. One thing I do love about Tuscan wine market is you can go and pick a bottle of wine off their wine wall and pay an opening fee of $10 and is yours. Gives you a lot more wine options.

AMBIANCE: 5/5. Tuscan Market &amp; Wine Shop is located across from the Jewel Osco in downtown Arlington Heights. It&#39;s a decent sized place with several tables, bar seating, and a long table in the back (belly bar) where many people can stand around and eat their food &amp; enjoy their drinks while waiting for a table to clear up (I usually just stand back there, as I enjoy looking at all the beers / wine that they have stored back there). At some of the longer tables you&#39;ll have to sit with other people, but it&#39;s fine, as everyone is very friendly, especially after a couple of drinks!

Depending on the night, there can be a wait for a table, but it&#39;s not much of a problem because you can stand at the belly bar and order drinks from there.


SERVICE: 5/5. I have been here many times and have always experienced great service. You&#39;re usually greeted at the door by someone who is checking ID&#39;s and who will help to find you a table. I&#39;ve never waited more than a few minutes to get a beer or a glass of wine. Food usually comes pretty quick as well. I find the employees to all be very friendly and knowledgable about beer/wine. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask for their suggestions if you aren&#39;t sure what to order!


FOOD (DRINK): 5/5. I mainly come to Tuscan for the beer &amp; wine, however, I&#39;ve eaten here on several occasions as well. My girlfriend and I will usually split a pasta dish (I enjoy the gnocchi) and one of their pizzas. My favorite pizza is the bacon jamboni--I highly recommend it. We&#39;ve tried several of the desserts, and they have all been great! There are many dessert options, so you&#39;ll be sure to find something that matches your tastebuds.

As for the wine &amp; beer, that&#39;s where Tuscan really shines! They have a few huge chalkboards full of their beer options--so really something for everyone! They even usually have a few Three Floyd&#39;s options. A lot of their beer &amp; wine is available for sale, so after you enjoy your drinks, you can take a home a six pack or two ;). 


TL:DR - Tuscan Market &amp; Wine Shop is a true gem of the downtown Arlington Heights area. This is me and my girlfriends go to place for drinks. The wine selections are great and the beer selection is ENORMOUS! The food is amazing as well. We typically pop in here after we&#39;ve had dinner and grab some of their tasty desserts--I highly recommend the lemon berry mascarpone cake and the carrot cake. The staff is friendly and very knowledgable. Overall, a great place to pop in for a quick drink of some tasty beverages!"

Like, Animal House, toilets make great pillows, and looking at beer makes everything worse hungover. I needed something simple and soup. Our friend had been wanting to check this place out for a while, and it was perfect. The shop is adorable and super comfortable. They have a great beer/wine selection and a cooler in the back with pop/water/juice etc. I grabbed a coke and sat for a minute.  The guys both got sandwiches, and they were delicious. I got a small soup and baked mostoccioli. The soup was fantastic, some kind of creamy potato/celery thing. I was able to eat it. Sadly I couldn&#39;t handle the mostoccioli at the restaurant itself, but I split it that afternoon with my mom and it was phenomenal. Delicious cold or microwaved. I can&#39;t wait to go back when we&#39;re in town again and I&#39;m a functioning human being. It&#39;s the kind of place you can relax with friends and totally lose track of the time."

Another downer, yet not enough of one to take off a star, is that if you buy a bottle from the store there&#39;s like a 10$ corkage fee to drink there. Lame. But you can buy a bottle off the menu without issue. :)

I was looking for an Italian place and this one had great reviews in urbanspoon and yelp. The fact that they had a massive craft beer selection written on blackboards sold me. We had the gnocchi with asiago cheese swimming in butter. AWESOME!!!! I am not into being healthy on a Sunday afternoon. The wife had the 3 cheese and pesto pizza. DOUBLE AWESOME!!!!  The crust was buttery and sweet. And crunchy. Our experience was a delightful one. The ultimate touch was the berries and mascarpone cheese cake. Just perfect!!!! After 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine we were very happy. They even let us try 2 different wines before ordering a glass. Awesome service. Highly recommended.

Luckily Tuscan Market has a TV and plays the game. It was pretty empty when we got there, probably because it was a Hawks game night and no one thought to go there, but the service was phenomenal. We were able to sample any beer on tap and the menu wines to see what we liked and the staff was very knowledgable about what they had. We had the Bar Board, which was pretty good, a few of our olives weren&#39;t quite ripe but other than that the meat selection was fantastic. We split the Garden of Eden and Goatee pizza. The GoE was interesting, the roasted vegetable mixture was an odd mix of veggies, the veggies themselves were good but did not have a ton of seasoning to them, but with the buffalo mozz and balsamic? Delicious. The Goatee pizza was just all around fantastic. 

But seriously, the thing to get here is the desserts. We had the giant chocolate cake and s&#39;mores tart. Both were so good that we are still talking about them nearly 24 hours later."

Food: The Tuscan Heat Pizza (Basil Pesto Sauce, Smoked Gouda, Mozzarella, Mild or Spicy Sausage and Hot Giardinerra) was incredible. My girlfriend got the Margherita Pizza, which was also amazing. The crust had a hint of sweetness (Wisconsin honey, per the owner) with a texture that resembled that of a pastry as opposed to your average pizza. They prepared and cooked the pizza within viewing distance of the bar, which was interesting to watch. All of the ingredients tasted fresh. I didn&#39;t expect the pizzas to be as good as they are, but indeed they are! For desert, we had the Lemon Berry Mascarpone Cake. This desert was incredible. My girlfriend is a very talented and creative baker and is very picky when it comes to deserts. She had a hard time letting me have just a few bites of this desert - it was that good. The perfect spring - summertime desert.

Staff: The lady (owner) at the front was incredibly friendly and down to earth. She was also very attentive. The young man making our pizzas did a great job as well. We saw him cleaning the kitchen area as we were eating which is always nice to see, especially after seeing every episode of Kitchen Nightmares and knowing how truly disgusting some restaurants owned by small businesses can be. 

Building/Atmosphere: The building is divided into two parts: 1) the restaurant 2) the wine shop (makes sense, given the name!). It&#39;s a smaller restaurant but has a charming and inviting feel to it. It also seems to be a place for locals to come for sports games as they were watching a hockey game at the bar next to us. They were pleasant and friendly as well. Overall, a pleasant interior and atmosphere.

To sum it up: Amazing pizzas and desert; incredibly friendly, attentive, and down-to-earth ownership, and a comfortable atmosphere make this place one of the top restaurants to visit in downtown Arlington Heights."

The draught list like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. I have been to tons of taphouses and brewpubs, and this place had the most unique selection I&#39;ve ever seen. Alot of places can boast that they have 20+ beers on tap, but usually they are all the same kinds I&#39;ve seen before or the beer sits and ends up not being fresh. The draught list is small, but is in constant rotation and not lacking in quality. I could honestly say I had not heard of any of the beers they had on draught, and they were all local to boot. They have a huge bottled beer and wine selection as well. 

The place is small, but don&#39;t get discouraged. Stand at the belly bar, have a drink, and wait; it is worth it! The staff was excellent.

With that being said, I&#39;m giving Tuscan Market &amp; Wine Shop a light 4-stars with a side of quiet animosity... (otherwise known as 3.5 stars). 

The location is perfect the idea is something that Arlington Heights was desperately lacking amongst the flutter of sadly sub-par bars that have somehow managed to survive in downtown Arlington Heights for so many years. I walked in excited to chow down on some pizza with my favorite lunch buddy, Nicole W. I&#39;d arrived a bit early and what I saw wasn&#39;t quite was I expecting, but made sense once I re-evaluated my expectations (wine bar) vs the what the aptly named eatery actual is (a market and wine shop). 

I was mildly greeted by a woman who asked me if there was something I needed help with, as if I had walked into the wrong place. I explained that I was meeting someone there for lunch and she replied, &#39;you order at the counter&#39; and then promptly walked away. Not so friendly, not so warm but hey, I get it. I had no make-up on and I know I look poor as sh*t and my cold-weather fingerless hobo gloves sure weren&#39;t helping, but it was a rainy day and I didn&#39;t feel like investing much time in my appearance- so sue me. 

So I grab one of only 4 or 5 small tables, lay my coat and the giant oddly shaped baby gift for my dear friend down and meander the market. I was excited to see they have a pretty decent beer selection that be purchased to-go and an even better cornucopia of craft beer at the small bar area. It wasn&#39;t a HUGE selection, but compared to other businesses in the AH area, this place might as well be a Binny&#39;s. 

I peeped the sandwich selection and larger pizza selection on the wall near the windows and had decided that the &#39;lil kakuna&#39; with Smoked Gouda, Kalamata Olives and Giardinara was happening, though there were several options up on the chalkboard that I&#39;d been eyeing. Luckily, Nicole Dubs is down with the spicy, so we decided to go in on the spicy pie and up the order with of their goatee (goat cheese, sun-dried tomato pesto and spinach). The pizza take about 15-20 minutes and are around 9-inches in diameter. The pizzas were dropped at our table and naturally, the smoked gouda pizza, was fantastic. How could it not be? But the Goatee was kind of lame.Pretty dry and just not something I was to invest more stomach real estate on. Nicole also pointed out to me that our pie had no sauce whatsoever. A little tomato would have done that thing some good and I&#39;m willing to bet that had our pizza come with the sun-dried tomato pesto the menu mentioned, it would have been a LOT better. 

When we were finished, I went up to the register and the woman working walked right by me and then went out to the tables to wipe them off. She wiped off every empty table before even acknowledging me standing there at the register and I know she saw me because at one point, one of the guys sitting at the bar asked her a question and she looked right past me and pointed to the wine I was standing in front of, then went on wiping tables. At the time, there were two other tables and two guys at the bar, so I really don&#39;t feel like it was too, terribly busy to the point where I couldn&#39;t be acknowledge. When she did come up to the counter she just stood there and I had to say, &#39;I&#39;d like to pay and get two boxes.&#39; I go to hand her the credit card and she walks away without saying anything and grabs our remaining pizzas. On the way back she asks if we want everything together or in two separate. I asked for separate so we could each take some home, and I had hoped to get a 1 slice of the good pizza and 1 slice of the &#39;meh&#39; pizza in each, but the woman seemed so turned off to communicate with customers that I didn&#39;t dare ask. 

Again, I could go a three-star on this and be happy, but that gouda pizza was b*tchin&#39; and I do believe that under normal circumstances and a wee bit friendlier customer service, that Tuscan would be a wonderful respite from the &#39;Irish&#39; bars and &#39;Mexican&#39; taquerias around the corner. Plus, there&#39;s good beer."

I was immediately taken care of! The staff greeted me and asked how they could help me. I came in for lunch and decided to get a glass of wine. They continued to check on me and make sure I had everything I needed... But not a hovering annoying way. 

I got the Goatee pizza which was amazing! If you like spinach and goat cheese, this is the one for you. The wine by the glass had decent choices. There were a ton of beer options though!! This is not JUST a wine bar!  They do have a larger selection of wines to purchase by the bottle. 

I came at lunch and it wasn&#39;t busy. The manager said dinner is their busiest time and they don&#39;t take reservations so keep that in mind ...and It&#39;s only street parking. 

But I would highly recommend this place!! A nice place to impress people for maybe a business lunch or family!"

If you do end up stopping here, you have to give the beer that tastes like root beer a try (I can&#39;t remember the name, but they will definitely know what you are talking about if you ask about it).  It really does just taste like root beer, but somehow it has an alcohol content of 10%, so you won&#39;t need much.:)"

They can make educated recommendations for beer or wine based on your food/mood/taste.
I love this place because I can try a couple new beers and have a fresh pizza after work. My better half likes this place to have a glass of wine and share a  Bar Board after a long day.

The place gets crowded at times but I don&#39;t think I have ever waiting longer than 10 minutes for a seat. You can even have a drink and look around the shop while you wait. 

I probably would not recommend for people who want to have a cheap light beer and some fried food."

I ordered a turkey and roast beef sub on Friday looking to live large and get something different than my normal Jimmy Johns.  The sub Amy made for me was probably my best sandwich of the year, bread was perfect with a bit of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside, pesto spread was great, Havarti cheese, tons of turkey and roast beef.  Sandwich is easily enough for two, or one very hungry person.  The white bean salad that comes with it (chips are an option) on the side is a nice touch for something different.  This place is way more than an awesome wine shop.  Make sure to stop in for the food or grab a bite to go before hoping on the train.  Thanks Amy and I&#39;ll be back soon."

It&#39;s really cute. And it&#39;s unique. It&#39;s like drinking wine in your friend&#39;s shop after hours. And, it helps that we almost overstayed our welcome (we left right at closing).

The owner is really sweet, and I felt good supporting her business. She has a good selection of wine and beer, a cute little alcohol-focused marketplace, and from what I saw on the menu, some good food options. 

There&#39;s a seating area which is more like a cafe, and another seating area on the other side of the restaurant that is like a side room in a bar. 

It&#39;s all brightly lit, a few blocks from the train and part of the downtown Arlington Heights atmosphere. It seemed like they were doing well when we went there and I hope she continues to prosper!"

This isn&#39;t the kind of place I would want to hang out at.  My old lady, on the other hand, though the shop/restaurant was great.  Dudes with patches on their tweed jackets, eating cheese and grapes, drinking wine, reading poetry.  Yuck...but SHE is literally next to me right now saying &#34;that was not the type of place it was&#34; and that the hipster were &#34;cute&#34; and seemed like &#34;nice people&#34;.  She liked the ambiance and really wants to go back and taste the wine.  They did have a ton of wine, but I didn&#39;t see the prices.

Back to the pizza...

We have had a VERY hard time finding pizza in AH.  I am a new york/napoli style pizza fan.  She is a Chicago deep dish/real napoli style fan.  Neither of us like chicago thin crust, typical square cut bar pizza.  That chicago style thin crust is in abundance in Arlington Heights and the surrounding areas.

I read numerous reviews on how great the pizza is here.  Its not.  It isn&#39;t even made on pizza dough.  They warm up premade flat bread and put cheese on it.  Not a fan at all.  The toppings seemed like good quality.  But over all, it was pretty bad."

This place is packed with people for a reason.  Amy and Tuscan family are a blast!!!  The wines and beers all change on a regular basis and the Tuscan Drops are awesome.  Tuscan drops are pizza dough stuffed with cheese and baked into little appetizer portions.  This leads me into the pizza...  So many different choices and you can create your own as well.
One more HUGE point.  As I mentioned, this place fills up and the crowd will stay.  Don&#39;t be shy here.  At the common table I always feel welcome sitting next to people I have never met before.

My boyfriend and I took a trip here for a little Saturday lunch date and we were both very happy with our decision. We were there for over two hours, and the majority of the time we had the place to ourselves. We started by trying a few wines, with the owner Amy telling us about each one. Then after we had decided on a bottle we started on that while we waited for our pizza. Although all of their pizzas sound amazing, we got the Goatee, and it was soooo gooooood. I&#39;m still thinking about it. The crust is slightly sweet, and with the goat cheese and mozzarella and spinach - delicious. After that I still had a little room for dessert, so since it was national pumpkin day (or something like that) I had the pumpkin cheesecake - oh baby, it was freaking good.

The owner was working and she made great conversation. If I did not live 1500 miles away this would most definitely be my after work watering hole. The Tuscan Market is not just a bar. It is more of  food and wine market  with a small wine and beer bar. They have several stools at the bar and some small tables. They had a great selection of micro brews. Thank You for the gluten free beer and I will be back next time I come to town.

The good:

- Bottomless steak fries!
- Onion tower appetizer! YUM.
- So many burgers to choose from.
- Extensive selection of drinks for a burger place.

The not-so-good:

- Crazy loud. Just.. too loud in here. 
- Long wait. Why are there even this many people eating here on a Saturday night? Red Robin isn&#39;t anything special. 
- Tables too close together. When we were finished eating, we had to fold our tables up to have enough room to stand up and leave without bumping into the group dining next to us. Soooo awkward. 
- Electronic ordering/paying devices. Some might find this useful but I found it kind of impersonal... Our waitress didn&#39;t make many appearances. It&#39;s also dangerous! We had an eight-year-old at our table that accidentally ordered and paid for a game. We never played it but it was put on the bill. Not cool. 
- The bill for a table of eight was $150+ for each to get a burger, a drink (or two), and all to share an appetizer. NOT worth it, in my opinion. 
- I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese burger. It sounded amazing but my expectations exceeded the burger. It was good, but not amazing. 

2.5 stars. Rounding up to 3. Meh. It was OK."

We each got different chicken sandwiches and pretzel bites as an appetizer. The sides really aren&#39;t &#34;bottomless&#34; when you&#39;re server never comes around to ask you if you&#39;d like more of your side. We also sat for quite some time without any refills on our drinks. Luckily neither one of us ordered anything spicy.

I had the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger with a side of their steak fries; the burger itself was just okay, but of wrong temperature; the sesame-topped bun was more on the dry/stale end T___T  The fries seem to be on the smaller scale, and not as thick and large as I remember them being.  Our server, who seemed nice, was totally MIA, and so we had to wave down another employee that was passing us by for extra napkins and condiments.  The food seemed to take much longer than the usual, and we were never checked upon to see if we needed anything else.  Even trying to get the check was such a hassle!

I recently went there to dine in for lunch because I had some extra time but I was alone so I just sat at the bar. It was slow in there at that time because it was late afternoon so the waiters were just chill and very friendly it was really nice.

I got my favorite burger the Whiskey River Bbq burger with the peach tea, so good!!

Nice diner - friendly service, good atmosphere and great food. So this a good burger joint - we started with the tower of onion rings, 5 of us we were gobbling up those, almost all of us got 3. So it was good. Then we ordered burgers, I ordered the Burnin Love with grilled Chicken, it tasted really good and ordered garlic fries with that. Really awesome burger, heavy stuff.

I ordered the mudd pie for dessert - man this was a monster 5 in ice cream layer, which has major chocolate ice-cream, then vanilla with cookie layer, then hard chocolate and then cookie base at bottom, and topped with whipped cream. This is definitely good enough for 3 people to share easily. Definitely try this if you are a sweet tooth and have one more person for company to finish it. Really good service overall.

Tip : With burger/entree , you can get unlimited steak fries or garlic/sweet potato fries for an up-charge."

I ended up having the Whiskey River BBQ burger with sweet potato fries, and my boyfriend had the Big Ghost Tavern Burger with regular fries. I also had the freckled lemonade (which is ALWAYS delicious) and my boyfriend had their iced tea (which, for only 10 calories, was amazing. He let me try it.)

We ordered the pretzels and the wing/chips combo for our apps. I noticed right away that the beer cheese with the pretzels was a little on the &#34;old&#34; side. It was starting to dry out &amp; just didn&#39;t seem right. But, since the pretzels were mainly for my daughter &amp; I anyway (while my husband &amp; son dined on the wings) - I didn&#39;t care much because I only use a tiny bit of cheese on 1 or 2 pretzels and then I eat the rest of the pretzels plain.

A few minutes later a manager came by, and apologized for the cheese. Said they were in the process of making new cheese and that what came out was not up to their standards, and they were sorry and would bring out fresh soon.

It wasn&#39;t a big deal and we finished the pretzels, so there wasn&#39;t a need for more cheese -- and the manager came back over later and told us he &#34;took care of the pretzels for us&#34; and apologized again. I thought that was awesome --- we didn&#39;t even complain in the first place -- it just wasn&#39;t a big deal --- but they recognized something wasn&#39;t up to par, and they went above &amp; beyond rectifying it.

The rest of our food was tasty -- and the new garlic fries are pretty good too (though, there is a 99-cent upcharge, which they don&#39;t exactly mention when they ask you what kind of fries you want to accompany your sandwich).

Overall, they did great."

I am a huge fan of the bottomless fries--they are seasoned, steak cut fries, and they have the seasoning at the table if you want more.  And last time I asked for a refill, and they came out so hot that I couldn&#39;t even eat them right away!!

OK, the burgers are just alright for me--not the best.  The chicken sandwich I got was amazing!  I have also tried their french onion soup--it&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but it&#39;s passable.  Their salad dressings are delicious, and (when your waitress doesn&#39;t forget it and then charge your $3 MORE than it was supposed to be, ahem) the salad is good, too.  Chocked full of veggies and croutons, and just the way I like it!

I also tried their specialty dessert the other day--the apple pie bites.  They were quite delicious.  They had a funnel-cake-like outside, and piping hot apple pie filling on the inside.  My friends stole a lot of them, because they were delicious! :)

I will definitely be back for my refill on fries!!"

Food was good, Cold beers, tasty burgers and awesome onion rings. So why a 2, why else the service. Ive had worse service for sure, there was nothing disasterous that happened it was just the attitude of our server and the lack of care that put a damper on the visit. Our waitress didnt really check on us at all during the meal but she seemed busy so not really a big deal. After we finished we waited a while for a bill and ended up asking her for it as she was at bar about 6 feet from us. She seemed irritated and when we declined desert she gave a bit of an attitude. She dropped off the bill and we gave our card, when the bill came back we noticed that we had been given and charged for someone elses bill. We called her back to notify her and she snatched the bill and said ill get a manager with a lot of negativity and attitude, no apology. Manager came back and rushed through an explanation that they just corrected the charge and didnt double charge us then ran off. It wasnt really a big deal but would have been nice to get an apology or seen some sense of them caring.

How frustrating, considering the fact that these people work in a industry where providing great customer service is in high demand.

I got the large onion rings and they were great, I got a reg bacon burger, and Kate reminded me all burgers came with mayo, thank god she did because I would have either spent the night in the bathroom wondering what I did so wrong in my life to deserve such pain or in confessional for hiding a body.

I&#39;m not sure if my experience was tainted because of the company, but we enjoyed a delicious meal and had a super time. The zucchini sticks were so good, as was the BBQ chicken wrap.  Our waiter was nice enough, but he could not remember to bring out our dipping sauces to save his life.

Their kids meals we&#39;re pretty standard and my son liked his spaghetti, while my daughter liked her upgraded slushy.

Red Robin&#39;s pretty much a burger/sandwich restaurant.  I had a turkey burger with chipotle sauce.  It was pretty good,.but what I really liked we&#39;re the bottom less garlic fries."

This new Red Robin location is definitely a great addition to the restaurant choices in this area.

When I saw they were putting a Red Robin nearer to me(the closest one being the one at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg), I was excited because this place rocks when it comes to burgers.

They have a vast menu that goes from their usual gourmet burgers to pasta, soups, salads, and wraps.  Definitely try their Towering Onion Rings which seems to be a very popular appetizer. 

I usually order the Royal Red Robin Burger which has a fried egg in it. Rather unique as far as your typical burger place. Their burgers are a good size, not too large, but I&#39;ll tell you this much, they are quite packed full of flavorful condiments as well as a tasty burger patty too! (Can be messy if they didn&#39;t have the burger wrapping covering half the burger when served.)

They have bottomless steak fries which are pretty darn fresh, crispy and hot when the come to your table.  Since they are bottomless, they are always fresh and hot.  But, my husband and I usually don&#39;t get much past the initial fry portion though.

Have not tried any desserts  yet, but the restaurant itself is typical of the other Red Robins in the area.  Brightly lit, very 60s burger place drive-in feel.  Definitely kid friendly as they have balloons they give to the kids as they leave. 

Staff is happy and helpful. And even on a busy busy Friday night, we got seated relatively quickly. (family of four here!)  There is ample parking, but it can get filled up rather quickly as there are several other eateries in the area (Buffalo Wild Wings, Subway, Asta La Pasta, Panda Express, Claim Jumpers, to name a few).

We are definitely returning to this Red Robin in the future!"

The food is good like other Red Robins, but the service sucked.  We had to talk to the manager becuase our waiter kept forgetting to bring us stuff and every table around us that ordered soup had to ask for it after it took forever, so it wasn&#39;t just our waiter.  Those at my table that ordered soup didn&#39;t even get it until after the meal.  They&#39;re nice people, but they suck at their chosen jobs."

They have a large selection of &#34;burgers&#34; with all kinds of spicy, gooey, salty or crunchy toppings. If you dont like the taste of meat in your burger, go here.. Imagine a fast food burger dipped in barbecue sauce, jalapenos and blue cheese for $10. You may get your moneys worth if you can eat 6lbs of fries and the pattys are definitely not the 1/2 lb standard were used to. Nice job dressing up a bad burger with all kinds of stupid toppings."

I love the fact that there is no cork fee if you bring your own wine that is not on the list. First time we went the 3 of us ball brought a $100+ bottle of wine each, they gave us a decanter, and it was great. 

Only reason I&#39;m not giving 5 stars is the last visit. My wife and I went out and I brought a special bottle of wine (22yo bottle of Napa Cabernet) which I was very excited about.  I warned the waitress the cork will be fragile, and I was not surprised that it began to crack and crumble when she opened. The waitress said she was going to take to the bartender to open, which I completely understood. However she brought the bottle back unopened and said they couldn&#39;t open it, and that the bartender said it was a &#34;bad bottle&#34; based on the smell. I knew this to not be true, and told her to push the cork down, pour through an aerator, into a decanter and bring it back. All ended well and the wine was one of the most beautiful wines I&#39;ve ever had. Just poorly handled by telling a first their several hundred dollar bottle of aged wine is &#34;bad&#34; based on he nose..  

I will for sure return again, still a big fan of the place but I&#39;ll be more careful of the wine I bring in the future!"

Servers are very attentive and personable. The presentation of the food is above average with some dishes, average with others.  

The dishes themselves are very good, but it&#39;s a chain cranking out meals. I wouldn&#39;t put anything in the outstanding category.  It seems like much of what you&#39;re paying for is not outstanding food, but ridiculously large portions of food.  

Having said that, if you want very good pasta dishes, versus really average pasta, this is your place versus the larger Italian chain that shall remain unnamed.  

Fried Ravioli and Burrata Caprese are very good in the appetizer category. Salad entrees are standard fare, and again, too large.  Most pasta dishes are above average, particularly the more unusual options, and not the dishes most restaurants offer.  And if you&#39;re a woman or lighter eater, you&#39;ll be taking some home. Desserts are decadent and large enough to share.  

More like 3.5 stars, but since we can&#39;t give half stars I bumped it up to 4.

They put a handful of their recipes on their website, so check that out if you like to cook.

Big thank you to all who add photos AND label them with the name of the dish.  It&#39;s very helpful to know what we&#39;re looking at, which isn&#39;t always obvious."

I&#39;d driven by Biaggi&#39;s multiple times but had never eaten here until yesterday.  It was a great choice!

We were in the Side Room and the food was Family Style.

Appetizers:  
Bruschetta: Really good, with a generous pile of fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and a balsamic drizzle.  

Margherita pizza:  Impressive, actually!  It tasted wood-fired so had great flavor with a slight chew in the crust.  The combo of cheeses was tasty!

Salad:
Caesar:  Pretty standard.  Crispy and good.

Entrees:
Spaghetti:  There were two types, actually: one standard spaghetti with sauce.  It was good.

The second was creamier (not sure what the official name was), but we were told it was supposed to accompany the Chicken Parmesan.  This pasta was my favorite between the two.

Chicken Parmesan: I&#39;m not a big Chicken Parm fan (cheese on chicken, meh), but it was very juicy and the marinara sauce was delish.  


Service was attentive:  Several servers came in and out taking drink orders, bringing appetizers, and clearing finished dishes.

I&#39;ve always felt that Italian food is pretty standard, but I was pretty impressed by the fresh flavors and how piping hot and delicious everything was.  I&#39;d like to try them again for a regular lunch or dinner."

We were seated right away and we came in on a Wednesday night around 8pm. We were greeted by our server right after getting seated. Our server was a very nice lady and I wish i remembered her name. She was very friendly and always checked up on our table which was nice.

I ordered the half pasta of lobster fettuccine. I used to work at the Deerfield location and fell in love with this dish. The half portion was very filing and I&#39;m glad i didn&#39;t get the full portion. 

They also have bread before your meals come in. I wished it was more fresh. Our bread was cold and I knew they were sitting out for a bit. The server also creates the dipping for the bread by serving olive oil with Parmesan cheese. 

Everything was very delicious and we enjoyed our meals."

I think I just forget that I don&#39;t really like it. Biaggi&#39;s is probably around a 3 star place. some things are good, others ok, and some just sad... This is just from what I remember.. I just had the sad today so that&#39;s why the 2 stars...

Started with a Bloody Mary... didn&#39;t get the antipasto skewer, just a couple of plain olives. Tried the Cucumber Martini, had potential but very lemony and it overpowered the cucumber. Should be called a Lemon Cucumber Martini...

Did the Burrata &amp; Tomatoes as an app. The whole plate was pulled from the fridge meaning everything was ice cold, firm, &amp; lacked flavor. It might have had flavor but I wasn&#39;t about to wait 30min for it to thaw just to find out...

Had 2 sandwiches, the prime rib, bacon, &amp; 3 cheese (almost sounds like a pizza), &amp; the sausage &amp; peppers. The prime rib sandwich was sparsely filled, you&#39;re eating mostly bread, I guess it tasted ok. The sausage &amp; peppers I think has mascarpone on it so it&#39;s like a creamy sandwich. Again way too much bread for what it is. If this place thought about it a little they would cut the sausage in half and split it so it was twice as wide almost filling the size of the bread. But what you get is a a sandwich that is part sausage and part peppers. Maybe they think you&#39;re going to share it with a vegetarian?? Bad fries served with both, like they&#39;d been sitting for an hour after cooking, some were soggy...

The place is jammed at lunch and service is slow, especially the bar... For what we had the price wasn&#39;t bad BUT I&#39;d have to actually like what I had for it to be worth it... I think why it&#39;s so busy is there is not really any other &#34;nice&#34; restaurant to go to in the area? YMMV..."

My family and I have probably eaten here 20 times in the last 6-7 years . It is a bit on the pricy side but I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for! 

Food: Appetizers: my mother is gluten free so she always gets the complimentary gluten free BREAD which honestly tastes better than the real bread to me! So good and it&#39;s very nice that they do not charge extra like other places . We get the STUFFED MUSHROOMS as well and those are stuffed with a sausage filling and they never disappoint .

Main:  SEA SCALLOPS AND RISOTTO is what I usually get. It is 6 generously sized scallops over risotto and two creamy sauces on the bottom. The only thing I wished they changed about this plate is making it warmer. The last time it was given to me it was like warm, like it had been sitting out for a while. For all you sea food lovers out there, the CAPELLINi DI MARE is an excellent dish- it has a slight kick to it and is packed with clams, shrimp, scallops, calamari, in a spicy tomato sauce, it is excellent and such a huge portion. The LASAGNA BOLOGNESE is also very good *I am Italian so I like to think I know good pasta ;) * the SPAGHETTI MARINARA is also very good, they put fresh mozzarella balls in it so if you are a cheese lover this dish is definitely for you. 

Desert: Now that I am 21 I realized my deserts went from pastries to alcoholic beverages. I uploaded pictures of my Godiva Chocolate Martini *which is seriously a must have, I&#39;m talking dangerously good, you could probably have 3 and not realize how much you were drinking lol!* and my sea scallop entree in case you would like to see how the food looks/is presented."

The private room is nice size, cozy, and seats about 20 ppl. Scallop risotto was delicious, chopped salad can also recommend to you. The service was eh. They were nice but not capable of handling party of 15 flawlessly. I had to pass guests appetizer plates myself. Also I ordered one more calamari dish, they forgot to bring it out. The server looked a bit tired: no energy. It&#39;s the hardest for every business that is dealing with costumer service to provide top notch high quality service. Nevertheless it is what really counts, not just the food. I would still come back. Overall not a bad experience. Sometimes things happen. Always give a chance."

The reviews about their gluten free items are spot on. We all ended up having the gluten free pasta and it was so delicious--I couldn&#39;t even tell it wasn&#39;t regular pasta. 

Also, I have to say their wedge salad was worth going back for too! Everyone in our party was happy after our meal here!:)"

I know it was a chain so I came with kind of low expectations but they were totally surpassed as we really thought this place is a good quality restaurant for fairly decent and comparable prices in the area. Upon arrival, we did have an earlier 5pm reservation and I was surprised how quickly the place filled up, so if you&#39;re coming on a Saturday night, definitely make those reservations so you don&#39;t have to wait.

Upon seating, we got a nice round table and were immediately served warm italian bread (I believe we got to try two different types that night) with some delicious olive oil for self service. Definitely a good way to start your meal. For appetizers we got the calamari and the bacon wrapped dates and both were absolutely delicious. I know the dates is more of a spanish dish so I&#39;m really happy they served it here. Also, the calamari had an awesome dipping sauce as well as the marinara so you got more choices to dip the dip (we dip). 

For our entrees, we went all out since we had such good luck with the appetizers. We got the black ink fetuccini with lobster (probably my favorite of the night) with decent size chunks of lobster so you definitely get your money&#39;s worth. We got a marinara pasta dish with roasted garlic shrimp which was also very tasty. We then got the cheese ravioli and it came with a marinara pesto sauce that was divine and I kept dipping more bread into it, we if we&#39;re going to be bad, we might as well be bad, right? And then we shared one of their pizzas which was tasty, but not my favorite dish of the night, we got the mushroom and sausage one but I wish it had more veggies or an option to get one with more veggies. I did like the nice crust on the pizza, so that&#39;s always a plus. We were seriously stuffed but then we decided we needed to try dessert and I had to go with my usual go to creme brulee. It came out and although it was tasty, it was warm and I prefer the actual custard to be chilled so I&#39;m wondering if it was sitting out for too long. I kind of wish we had the tiramisu instead so that was the only bummer of the night and the reason they didn&#39;t get the full 5 stars in my book. We also celebrated my mother in laws birthday so they were nice enough to bring out a vanilla ice cream scoop with a candle, so that was a nice touch.

Overall, nice atmosphere, not overly loud and great for larger parties. The food is definitely tasty, some dishes are better than others, and the service was excellent. He checked up on us a few times making sure we did okay. I&#39;ll definitely be back for future occasions, big or small but I&#39;ll ask them to keep my creme brulee chilled for me."

Arrived at 3 o&#39;clock. There were a few people still in the restaurant but it was not empty and it was not hustled lunch time. We asked the waitress to please heat the bread since it has been served previously ice cold. She went on to explain that it was in between the fresh lunch bread and the not finished baked dinner bread. In other words it was stale bread. But she finally agreed to have it warmed. It was warm when it got to our table. My husband ordered wine and I ordered a Diet Coke. Both served promptly. We ordered the Baretta appetizer and the eggplant parmesan. We explained that we were going to be sharing both the appetizer and the main entree. The Beretta was served on a plain dinner platter and gave every appearance of being pulled out of the fridge and put on our table with no serving instruments. The basil was even wilted. I was just looking at previous reviews and the picture of John S. Baretta platter looked beautiful in comparison to what we were served. Told the waitress we were not satisfied with the appetizer. We have had the same appetizer in the past and enjoyed it very much. Try to explain that this was not the same as previously ordered but we were told that it&#39;s been served that way for the last year-and-a-half. The sous-chef even came out and tried to explain to us that it was serve the same way it has been served for years. However he didn&#39;t see it when it was returned to the kitchen. I asked him just to take it off the check and that we just didn&#39;t want it. We did not want it replaced. This encounter went on for approximately 15 to 20 minutes and we were debating on whether to stay and wait for entree or leave. In the meantime my refill on my Diet coke never came. While the sous-chef was there our eggplant Parmesan was served in the middle of the table no serving utensils no plate to put it on. And from the serving size it appeared to have been split in the kitchen and we were being served only half of a serving. We have had the eggplant Parmesan previously and it was a serving that could not be finished. We had taken half of it home. After that I was just tired of arguing with servers and left and will not return again. We were extremely happy with this restaurant the first and second visit but something is going on there and the service and the food is going downhill rapidly. And basically I agree with John S again, on our previous visit I had the prime rib sandwich and it was a good bun. You had to look real hard to find the meat and when you did it was dried and stale. That sums it up that was our last visit to Biaggi."

I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  The hostess was lovely, and my server Amanda was just great!  I was thinking about an appetizer, but when she shared that they had asparagus soup that I jumped on - beyond delicious.  Nice break and the entree - the spaghetti carbonara was great!  And the biggest thing for me is they didn&#39;t suggest the tip amount on the receipt  I&#39;ll be back for sure!

Ok, let me describe the fried ravioli. Some would think square dip in marina etc. These were delicious. Amazingly delicious. Crunchy pockets of cheese and spinach filled pastries in a light cheesy Alfredo like sauce. Almost like a Italian-style Japanese dumpling. I housed them, which is why my pic only has one left!

Tonight I ordered the pizza, made in a stone oven and Lasagna. I originally gave this place 4 stars, just because 5 to me mean exceptional, but I changed it to 5 because the food here is THAT good.

We got there at 6:30 and it was SO LOUD. Why are all restaurants these days created so that you can&#39;t talk to anyone unless they&#39;re right next to you? I don&#39;t get it. What happened to sound dampening ceiling tiles, etc? I guess I&#39;m old, LOL! 

Anyway, the service was terrific; we had a young woman who was very attentive to our needs. I had a nice glass of wine, a side salad and the the spaghetti with marinara sauce. The salad was drenched in dressing, which made it almost inedible for me. So if you don&#39;t like your salad drowned, ask for the dressing on the side - duh, I should have known that. I ordered the smaller size of spaghetti and I was happy I had that option. The sauce was nice and overall, the food was OK. I would say the food was three stars, the service was five stars and the ambience was three stars (because of the decibel level).

I&#39;ve seen some lackluster responses here which surprise me, so I want to give a different perspective.

Frankly, I love this place. There&#39;s one waitress (I forget her name or I&#39;d post it) that I try to avoid because she&#39;s not the greatest, but other than that I&#39;ve lost count of how many times their service and servers have impressed me. They&#39;re attentive without being intrusive, quick, and eager to please. My mom walks with a cane and the hosts always try to find her the closest spot available to minimize her walking. I appreciate that.

My diet has changed over the years so my favorites have changed and now I&#39;m more focused on their healthier entrees. Stopped in for lunch on Wednesday and had the 410-calorie filet mignon off the &#34;lighter&#34; menu and I&#39;m telling you it was delicious. Cooked perfectly rare, as I requested, on a bed of roasted root vegetables. Fresh, hearty and satisfying without the heaviness. Thumbs up. They had a tasty pinot noir as well, and the torrontes wine I sampled from my lunch partner was just fantastic. I&#39;d go back just for a glass of that."

We ordered the white sangria, which was good, but I don&#39;t recommend eating the fruit...that didn&#39;t taste good. They also have a lighter menu now, so I ordered the salmon. It was very tasty, just a smaller portion than the other regular dishes you would order. We also had to devour the tiramisu...that was not a mistake. So good!

Our food was pretty amazing too. I always order the same exact thing when I go to Biaggi&#39;s (we may be go once a year)... the dish never changes and that is good! (I wish I could remember what it is called... Ziti al Forno, maybe). Our entire party enjoyed their meal.

My review is limited to Biaggi&#39;s gluten-free pizza, as I got it for carry-out. I custom ordered a gluten-free pizza with red &amp; green peppers, mushrooms, and spinach. It was a 10&#34; football-shaped pizza with 6 pieces.¬†

The vegetables were fresh &amp; saut√©ed, and the crust was thin &amp; had a nice, crispy crunch to it like it was fire-roasted in a brick oven. I couldn&#39;t even tell by the taste or texture that it was gluten-free. It wasn&#39;t bland, chewy, or cardboard-like, such as other gluten-free pizzas I have tried. The portion is enough for 1 person or would be good to share as an appetizer.

I would definitely order a pizza again from here when I want a personal-sized,¬†gluten-free pizza as it was one of the best ones I&#39;ve tried so far. Also, Biaggi&#39;s has a whole¬†gluten-free menu with many gemtastic options including gluten-free pasta &amp; complimentary gluten-free bread upon request (both of which I&#39;ve yet to try)¬†in addition to the few varieties of gemriffic, gluten-free pizzas.

We both ordered the lighter menu 1 pork chop which was very tasty and came with a side of veggies for $13. The service was exceptional.

I first went to one in the Toledo area and fell in love with their wedge salad. I do not like blue cheese (it&#39;s the only cheese I won&#39;t eat - I&#39;ll give it a try every few weeks or months to see if my palate has changed and every time I come to the same conclusion that it&#39;s just not for me).

Biaggi&#39;s wedge salad though...divine. It&#39;s the ONLY thing I remember about the meal each time I&#39;ve been. I was so happy when I saw there was one near where I now live. My husband, who lives wedge salads, said it was the best he&#39;s ever had. The blue cheese isn&#39;t overpowering, but just enough for me.

Our pasta was not memorable, but it was good. I had spaghetti and meatballs and my husband had some linguine. The nice thing is that you can order half portions, which are just enough to satisfy without making you feel full.

All in all, it&#39;s good Italian dining. I&#39;d put it a bit above Maggiano&#39;s, but mainly because of that wedge salad.

Service was good - we sat at the bar because it was very crowded. Our food arrived promptly and I couldn&#39;t have asked for just the right amount of attention from the bartender. She didn&#39;t harass us repeatedly, but made sure we were well taken care of throughout our experience there.

Yesterday my aunt, daughter and I went there before our show for wine and appetizers.  The Margarita pizza was good and we ordered our favorite wine which is the house wine.  We decided on a second glass so when we ordered more but was told by the waiter they ran out.  I was surprised as it was a Wednesday night but asked if they could just bring us another similar Chardonnay and charge us the same price. The waiter left but the manager, Sam, came up and told us that he couldn&#39;t do that.  He was less than friendly. I was shocked as there wasn&#39;t anyone at the bar and only two other tables had guests.  You would think he would want us to stay and continue ordering. Biaggi&#39;s, such poor customer service has just caused you to lose some loyal customers.

Wife wanted to try the mussels appetizer that we&#39;ve seen on menu before.  And of course it&#39;s not on there.  Asked the bartender and he said sure they can make that for us.  Bonus points.  Was great only a couple weren&#39;t really opened.  Also highly recommend the caprese appetizer, had multi colored cherry tomatoes, burratta mozza, pesto, balsamic reduction and a red sauce i couldn&#39;t really identify.  Might have been some sort of red wine vinegar.  Excellent.  Then we split a pasta dish, that had italian sausage, lump crab, green onion in a light white broth over thin spaghetti.  This we couldn&#39;t finish but was also excellent.   There are some hidden gems on the menu here and it doesn&#39;t break the bank.

But what was really upsetting was the fact that the server kept bringing me refills of the strawberry lemonade I originally ordered only to charge me for each.  Had he asked and explained they were not free refills I would have respectfully declined.  My lemonade cost more than the one glass of wine!  So beware of waiters bringing non-alcoholic refills.

Pepperoni pizza
Bruschetta
Fried Ravioli
Tiramisu
Goose Island Orange Cream Soda
They also gave us a bag full of complimentary bread of different sorts.

The pizza had a wonderful thin crust and the perfect amount of sauce. It was cheesy and the pepperoni was very good.

The ravioli was OMG, so good! The cream sauce for dipping was unbelievable!

The bruschetta was good and the mozza balls were soaked in balsamic, mmmmm!

The tiramisu was great! Creamy and full of flavor!

The soda, came as a recommendation by the guy on the phone and it was a great on at that! Never has a soda been so good!  :)

The bread in the bag was really good too, our favorite being the onion bread.

Overall, we would highly recommend this place to anyone and will go back if we are in the area again! It was a great meal in a nice hotel room and good end to our day of travel!

Thank you, Biaggi&#39;s!"

We had a reservation and noted we had children and would need ample space. We were seated half an hour after our reservation at a terrible table that was makeshift with wobbly chairs   We were seated for a LONG time before a drink order was taken and even longer to get water. We were told there was not enough glassware for all of us to have water!  After more than half an hour we were asked if we wanted appetizers. We noted that it was now far too late for that.  It was then another long fm period of time before our order was taken. Then it was a long time for dinner to arrive   When some of our guests left before they dessert arrived due  to the long delay between that order and delivery the waitress was completely oblivious   What should have been an hour and a half dinner was a three hour tortuous ordeal.  And the food was really not even close to good enough to make up for the very unpleasant dining experience

The waitress was very nice and attentive. My spinach salad was pretty good. The vinaigrette needed a good pinch of salt as it was under seasoned. My husband&#39;s house salad looked fresh and he liked it. I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. He ordered the Bolognese. The pasta that came with the Eggplant was okay. The Eggplant was very thick and a little soggy. My husband barely ate his Bolognese. They should warn customers that is not a typical Bolognese and instead is noodles flavored and coated with sausage. We barely ate touched it. For a town with so much Italian influence, this place was a bit disappointing. It was a $50 meal for two and we left hungry. Go to Maggianos instead. At least they&#39;re consistent there."

I went Sunday night for dinner with the in-laws. Our waitress was a little bit slower than what we are used to, but not terrible. I ordered the Cappellini di Mare (pasta with calimari, scallops, mussels and shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce). The sauce was the perfect amount of spicy. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, and the scallops were tender and buttery. I also tried some of the pork chop which was also great.

The service here is truly some of the WORST service I have EVER received!!

We usually head over around 3:00, so the place is pretty dead.  On each visit we have received lack luster greetings from our hostess and server (once the hostess was even sitting at the bar on her phone).

On our first visit I waited so long after I finished my first drink for our server to come back that I ended up going to the bar to order my own drink.  We decided to see if Biaggis could redeem itself and decided to try again (silly us).  So we went back for what would be our LAST visit, ON MY BIRTHDAY.  We ordered dronks, wine and a martini and some food.  We got our drinks, ate, and then we waited (while watching our server text and sip pop) for 35 minutes for our server to return so we could order a second round of drinks.

I have never encountered a friendly server here, which is really disappointing.  I want to like this place because I love the fried ravioli and my coworker loves the best salad but I cannot get part the abysmal service.  Sorry Biaggis."

Bleached, enriched flour pasta is NOT Italian, even if it is made on site w/squid ink (they do this, which is a point in their favor). Gluten free selections do exist here, but need work. To be fair, real Italian pasta is hard to find in an American restaurant, &amp; the American palate does not seem to notice. However, once you have had real Italian pasta, you can never go back. Good pasta is like good bread, it is delicious with nothing but some olive oil &amp; It cannot compare to the flavorless, nutritionally void muck which is called &#34;pasta&#34; here in the states. Real Italian pasta is Durum Semolina which has not been bleached,or enriched.

I went with a couple girlfriends for an early dinner (6pm).  They were a little busy, so we waited 20 minutes for a table, so we had a seat at a &#34;high top&#34; table at the bar.  One of the bar waiters was a little bit rude and sassy asking if we were going to order drinks.  We ordered a couple drinks and of course when we did, our buzzer went off!  We asked the hostess if we could have our drinks brought to our table, and that wasn&#39;t an issue.  Well, there was an attitude brought with our drinks to our table by our bar waiter!

When we got to our table, our waitress went from attentive and friendly to slow as molasses.  We waited honestly almost 30 minutes for her to take our order.  She kept coming by our table but would disappear before we could catch her!  I ordered the butternut squash pasta which was DELICIOUS!  My friends ordered the chicken salad with no bacon...which bacon was on the salad!

I felt they are a little pricey for their portions...my ravioli was $9.50 for about 6 raviolis.  The bread is DELICIOUS, I would honestly be happy with just the bread! :)

Overall I was disappointed with our visit, food was solid, but the service was horrible!  But I would check it out anyways...could have just been a bad night! :)"

Since one of my best friends was having her baby shower there, I had the opportunity to feast on a fantastic Italian lunch - and be proven wrong.

From a guest&#39;s perspective, Biaggi&#39;s did an amazing job ensuring that everything was perfect for the shower. The room was set up perfectly, the staff was more than accommodating, and the food was superb. 

Lunch consisted of a Caesar salad (to date, is the only one I&#39;ve ever liked), some meaty Rigatoni Alla Bolognese, and Chicken Marsala with some creamy effin&#39; mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. It was all superb. 

Overall - My first experience certainly won&#39;t be my last. I look forward to the next time where I can pick and choose off the standard dinner menu."

In summary, it is a great restaurant, with a lunch time limit of 75 minutes, with astonishingly affordable prices given the quality and portion of the food. I guess that&#39;s one of the perks of being in the burbs. 

The most memorable part of my experience here though came from the service, in paticular, a bespectacled Joe Manganiello look-like waiter. His highly animated and passionate demeanors were the best I have seen:

&#34;Alright I am gonna set the sugar between you two ladies.&#34;
&#34;I am gonna sneak in on your left.&#34;
After reciting perfectly the ingredients and the way the specials dishes were cooked -&#34;alright i am gonna set this menu here so that you all can fight for it.&#34;
The best one-liners came when we were getting the bill:
&#34;let me go find one of those check presenters.&#34;
Came back empty handed - &#34;sorry the check presenter god is not in my favors today.&#34;

Anyways, aside from the extra cordial and attentive service, the food was definitely better than your usual lunch options, especially for someone that usually works in the loop. I got a half pasta and half salad combo for...wait for it...$9.99! And you can have unlimited refills of salads. AND, the pasta was actually good! It was a lobster salad with black linguini which had good texture and surprisingly abundant lobster meat. The salad was very good too, with their house vinaigrette being one of the best I&#39;ve had. Truth is, before my entree, I was already 1/2 full from eating their delish baguette. 

Their menu is pretty big with pretty standard ristorante italiano options. On the back of their menu, they have this &#34;newer&#34; lighter side menu. I couldn&#39;t help but wonder - if those salads are around 500 calories, what does that make my lunch - a creamy lobster sauce dressed pasta, a salad, and maybe 5 pieces of baguette. I knew better than diving into that endless hole of guiltiness, and instead stuffed the thought down my throat with none other than my 6th piece of baguette."

If you can stop yourself from eating the delicious foccacia bread and olive oil to get to your meal...

My favorite is the chopped salad, but he butternut squash ravioli, minestrone soup, and lasagna fritta are all fantastic. The pork chops are stellar too, so tender and seasoned well. I can&#39;t remember all the other things I&#39;ve tried, but they have all been good, I&#39;ve never been disappointed. You can tell they put time and care into their food, it&#39;s not mass produced or cheap. All the food is definitely cooked to order, you never feel like your food is sitting back behind a heat lamp somewhere, or has been stale. Actually, with the crowds this place draws, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d have time for anything to get old! (Make a reservation for the evening! We&#39;ve gone in on weeknights and waited 30 minutes, and on the weekend it&#39;s not even worth trying sometimes without calling ahead, but the food is SO worth it!) 

For dessert, while I&#39;m typically a chocoholic, nothing beats the lemon cake, in my opinion. I have actually gone to Biaggi&#39;s and gotten the lemon cake to go, it&#39;s that good.

They have a  great bar, lots of delicious wines and bellinis. 

They also have nice looking group rooms, never gotten to go to a party there, but I imagine it would be wonderful.

On a summer weekday, some of the customers defiled that image, though. The pasta dishes are somewhat more sophisticated than you would expect from a chain - especially the Linguine with Lobster and the Cappelini de Mare (Both about $17 -18), the items we had on our latest visit. Service was generally good, as they have food runners and the staff is efficient.  Only the use of blinking, buzzing, and even talking &#34;pagers&#34; takes away a bit from the elegance, but it does keep things in order and allow, I suppose, for slipping in &#34;special people&#34; without undue notice."

The best part of the meal was the bread. We ordered bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. They were ok but the different pieces of bacon were unevenly cooked -meaning some were slightly underdone. I decided to try the margharita pizza. As Biaggi&#39;s is supposed to be Italian I expected tomatoes,fresh mozzarella and basil. Nope. This was a processed cheese pizza with a couple bits of basil and not much tomato flavor in the sauce. Wow was I disappointed.  I don&#39;t mind a good cheese pizza but this one was really bland and the crust was disappointing also.  When the waiter came by he asked if the food was delicious and I had to tell him no as the pizza was not what I thought I had ordered. He told me that he agreed that it was not a margharita pizza and had previously discussed with management but management thinks it is one because the pizza is red, white and green. He even had the manager come over and we discussed the issue. They offered to bring me something else but because my boyfriend&#39;s spaghetti and meatballs were kind of flavorless also I decided I didn&#39;t want another disappointment. 

The waiter was good so I will give it more than one star but as there are many other really good Italian choices nearby like Gianni&#39;s and Enzo and Lucia I don&#39;t think I would ever go back."

I&#39;m giving the benefit of the doubt on this one. I was there around 7:30PM on a Tuesday evening and ate at the bar, so I had no issues with waiting as other reviewers mention. While I live nearby, this was my first visit to ANY Biaggi&#39;s. Living in the Chicago area, I typically avoid the chain Italian restaurants because there are so many good independent options here. As for my experience: 

Food - The soup special for the evening was wild mushroom.... &#34;like buttah&#34;. It was very good. For my entree, I ordered the lasagna; mixed reviews on that. What I liked about it was the flavor of the meat sauce and the chunks of meat in it were really robust and flavorful. But the downside was that the sauce had &#34;cool&#34; spots in it; needed to have been heated more. And the noodles were nowhere close to al dente - they were pretty nondescript and mushed into the cheese and sauce. I had an apple tort for dessert - that was pretty good. 

Service: It took just a little longer to be acknowledged than what I would have liked, but once I was, the staff was very personable. I was given bread and beverages promptly; items from the kitchen were just a little slow, but not intolerable by any means. Two bartenders were working and both served me as if they were one server - totally seamless in that respect. And both were great at making conversation and checking on me - and other customers at the bar and at booths and tables in the bar area. They are the reason for the &#34;benefit of the doubt&#34; rating of four stars 

I&#39;ll likely return - overall a good experience."

My favorite items are the Pasta Marinara, Margherita Pizza, and Pasta Di Mar.

Ordered the Calamari.  Waitress came back to tell us the Bruschetta was on it&#39;s way.
DInner....
Tilapia...was good..not great though.
Sea Scallops...average.
Chicken Picatta....very good.
Kids Pizza for my 7 year old daughter....it was a 10&#34; pizza.  Errr.....

The place was very busy and very loud.  While walking out there was nothing I had just experienced that would make me desire to return."

Ordered wine, which the waitress spilled all over a disabled member of my party.
She apologized, but did not offer to get the clothes dry cleaned, or inquire as to the damage to the shoes and purse.
Ordered pasta with walnuts, which were rancid.  Complained.
Management took no action, either on the spill or on the walnuts.
Never going back. Horrible experience."

Their food is delicious  and filling. I am always trying something new and always find myself very happy with whatever I get. 
The hosts are always welcoming and attend to us quickly. Everything seems to be clean and in order.  The servers are super friendly and also have great tastes. I love asking them what they like and what they would recommend because let&#39;s face it, they know best.  So there&#39;s no need to go into details because everything is great here and you really can&#39;t go wrong with anything! I&#39;ve had their pizza, pastas, sounds, salads and sandwiches and they are so flavorful. 

You will have to spend a bit more than your typical italian places but it&#39;s totally worth it. 

For those of you thinking of having a gathering, this is the place to do it. They have a back room where it can be closed and have your mini private party. If I were business owner or event planner wanting to take out my employees I would take them here."

Their complimentary bread is very good too.

We had a reservation for 6:45pm and upon arriving were told they were running behind schedule due to a Sadie Hawkins turnaround event at one of the local high schools!  (Funny, the last time we got together with this couple, same thing happened. School event and the restaurant was up for grabs!!!). Anyway, they told us it would be approximately 20 minutes before we would be seated!  Turned out to be 40!

We were seated at a booth, next to a table of many teens! (They were very well behaved!). It took our server about ten minutes to finally get to our table, but it was worth the wait!  Tony, our waiter couldn&#39;t have been nicer or more attentive!! He apologized for the delay and proceeded to take our drink orders and bring a great basket of bread to the table!  He also made up our plates of olive oil/cheese/pepper for the bread!  

Upon arriving back at the table with drinks, he went over the menu specials; although it was so loud we could hardly hear him!! Regardless, since we&#39;ve been here numerous times we knew what we wanted and ordered right away!  

I ordered a bowl of the Lobster chowder soup which was served almost immediately, but the entrees took quite a while to be served!  As always, the food lived up to its reputation!!  I had the Garlic Shrimp Oreganata, and it was scrumptious!  My husband had Shrimp &amp; Crab Cannelloni which we&#39;ve had before and still as good as ever!!  

Our friends had SALMON &amp; SHRIMP MILANESE and FILET MIGNON SALAD and both said it was very good!  

Our server, Tony came back many times throughout the meal to check if we needed anything, to refill our drinks, etc. prior reviews have stated the service here is not up to par but we did not find that to be the case with our server!  One of the BEST dining experiences I&#39;ve had in a long time!!!  I&#39;d give Tony five stars, but due to the wait, overall only four stars!!!  

In the future will ask to be put in Tony&#39;s section if he&#39;s working when we return!!!"

My daughter was actually with me this time, and I gotta say, the waiter really really took care of us.  He brought her extra crayons when she broke her first set.  He brought her out a little place of carrots and orange slices.  She loved it and finished the whole plate and so he brought her MORE.  That was a great gesture.

That was the extra mile.  Now for the normal stuff.  I had some Eggplant Parmesan, which was great.  Crispy on the outside and plenty of marinara.  It also comes with a little side of spaghetti.  Very good dish and big portion size.  I was starving, so I finished it all off.

Once before, I&#39;ve ordered this baked pasta dish, which has this crumb-like crust on top.  Wow.. that was awesome as well.  Can&#39;t remember the name of it.

The restaurant is a little bit higher priced than your average Italian place, but with the quality of service they had this time, I didn&#39;t mind paying a bit of a premium at all."

Their gluten free pasta is the best I&#39;ve had in the area, and I&#39;m seriously obsessed, in particular, with the alfredo one minus the prosciutto. They do carry-out too, so when I&#39;m frustrated with nothing else gluten free to eat I can call Biaggi&#39;s and take pasta home to watch with a feel-good movie :) They even have gluten free bread! And while, granted, it&#39;s not like normal bread by any means, it&#39;s warm and they add seasonings to it so when dipped in olive oil it tastes pretty darn good. Biaggi&#39;s makes me feel normal, and not like some gluten free freak, so with its plethora of options I would not hesitate recommending this place to anyone and everyone- most specifically those who are gluten free."

I was on a first date and figured it would be a safe and not too messy dish for a sometimes clumsy girl :).  The dish was fantastic.  The hearty Alfredo sauce went perfectly with the nicely sized portion of chicken included.  The entree was large enough that I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day as well!  We also had a couple drinks from the bar... me the martinis since I love trying out new mixtures and him a couple glasses of wine.  The service was quick and friendly.

Cash only.

Friendly folks that always have the Cubs game on. Daily newspapers line the counters. The place is very cozy.

They have a choice of sizes for your sammies... Hungry, really hungry, and food-coma.

I tend to get the meatball sandwich in the food-coma size. Big juicy meatballs that are very tasty and drowned in a thick red sauce and mozzarella served on a toasted french roll. Amazing.

The other subs are good, too. The bread is very soft with a thin but crispy crust that won&#39;t tear up your gums.

Plenty of parking in the HUGE lot right behind the place. The small lot on the corner of 83 and NW Hwy is very deceiving.

A couple of picnic tables outside for you to enjoy your food whilst people watching. The train station is directly across the street so traffic can get pretty gnarly during rush-hour or any time a train rolls thru town."

Everything here is better and bigger than expected. The buns and meats are fresh and generous (you know the ads for subs you see from other companies that have piles of meat and when you go to the actual store you get a single slice? Well Submarine Express is the real thing). 
The fries are one size (huge) and more crispy than some might like but a favorite of my wife. Tom, the owner, is a great guy and you should take him for what he is--straight forward, blunt, and in the true Chicago style. I love to stop in and chat (go Cubs/Bulls/Bears!)
The portions are so generous you can get a 6 inch and a fry, cut the sandwich in two and two people that aren&#39;t outrageously hungry can have a filling lunch.

I am a sangwich aficionado and I&#39;ve had my share of the best, this place does it right. My first visit I got the usual1st-time assortment of sangwiches for 1 person: I got the Submarine, Corned Beef, Pastrami and Roast Beef. The Submarine is like their Special and it most certainly is a special sangwich. The meats and the cheeses put on the Special are all top-notch and only enhanced by gardinera. The Pastrami was well done, not too salty, great pairing with the cheese and veggies. Roast Beef was spectacular and the hot gardinera set it off, however, the Corned Beef sangwich, with lettuce, onion, tomato and hot gardineral was of the charts! The bread they use at Submarine Express is the best I&#39;ve had yet (sorry Windy City Subs) and it makes the whole sangwich. Next up on my next visit: Italian Sausage and a charbroiled burger (the smell of them being grilled up was killing  me when I was there!)"

I really enjoy the Turkey sandwich. You can really taste the fresh ingredients, especially the cheese that they use.  I also like that they stock Coca Cola glass bottles from Mexico, which tend to have better taste than the USA manufactured ones (matter of opinion)."

The building itself has stood for over a century and is the size of a large shack, but is home to the best subs in the area. Subs stacked with thickly sliced meats and cheeses, fresh veggies, oregano, oil, and vinegar on chewy Italian bread are their specialty. Some of their best subs are the flavorful, but not too salty beef salami, the Submarine, featuring mortadella bologna, juicy deli style ham, and that great beef salami, and the corned beef sub. Delicious homemade soups are served anytime besides summer with the homemade chili served year round. Submarine express also does a great rendition of the Chicago style hot dog and serves several Mediterranean specialties such as baklava and Greek salad and other Chicago fast food staples."

If you decide on a sub you are going to get a real amount of meat, not the three minuscule slices you get from Subway or the like.  If you order extra meat it&#39;s piled so high you can barely get your mouth around it.

Highlights -- marinated chicken sandwiches -- try it on a sub roll which is brushed with garlic butter and toasted.  Except during the summer, the soups are tremendous.  The chicken fingers are seasoned nicely and they give you a huge portion.  I can&#39;t speak for standard burgers and hot dogs here because that&#39;s not what Sub Express is about.

The prices are extremely reasonable for the portions you receive.  Overall, a great find in the NW &#39;burbs."

Rosati&#39;s in Streamwood is one example of great local pizza.  

For the record, I grew up in the Chicago suburbs (Bellwood) and never had deep dish until I was in my 20&#39;s.  Our pizza was always the thin-enough-to-cut-yourself-on-the-crust version.  While I like deep dish once in awhile, thin is my preference.  And while Rosati&#39;s offer plenty of crust options, it is their thin crust that stands out for me.  The sauce, crust, and cheese are all great here.  I&#39;ve said before that if a pizza can impress with just cheese, you know you&#39;ve got a winner.  My gf likes cheese only so I find myself &#39;tasting&#39; (as in, I&#39;ve eaten my half and now I&#39;ll &#39;help&#39; you with yours) the cheese only and can say it never disappoints.

So for those of you that are in the habit of getting pizza from a national chain, give Rosati&#39;s a try and you&#39;ll see what Chicago pizza really tastes like.  You won&#39;t go back to the other place.  

And while I understand the convenience of delivery, pickup is the way to go for that hot out of the oven taste.  Where&#39;s the fun if you don&#39;t burn the top of your mouth?"

(Part of the reason I use GrubHub is I can enter my order instead of relying on someone in a loud environment trying to understand me.)  Ordered a Sausage Supreme Thin Crust Pizza, and was impressed with the communication from them via GrubHub - I was alerted of a delivery time, then they updated me with a new time and the name of the driver.  The pizza arrived on-time and was very good, but they missed the instructions requesting pie cut.  Still, the pizza was good and at least it was the correct order, unlike recent orders from CPA and Taylor Street.  

The next day I received a call from the manager following up on my experience and actively trying to learn how to improve.  That won me over almost as much as the pizza itself.  I will try them again and hope that they can deliver an excellent pizza per my requirements in a timely manner at a competitive price - that&#39;s all I ask for, and apparently many find that hard to achieve."

Baked mostaccioli is another fav, breaded mushrooms yet another. They appear to have this thing called a &#34;salad,&#34; whatever that is, tried it, it&#39;s OK. A bunch of rabbit food, but rabbits seem healthy, so maybe I&#39;ll have that again one day.

Tons of other options, can&#39;t recall trying most of them because Deep Dish, Baked Mostaccioli and Breaded Mushrooms are my overwhelming favorites.

We always picked up so I don&#39;t have any delivery data, but I do have to say the orders were, and I hate to say it, messed up sometimes. They are willing to do whatever it takes, but having to go back, or explain the next time what happened the last time, is a bit of a pain. It happens, so I&#39;m not even gonna dock the rating for it."

It sounded great so I got that with a pepperoni calzone.  That was probably the best part of the experience was the phone call.
They told me delivery with in an hour but it was a little over an hour.  I felt like the bottom of the pizza was burned. It was not black or anything but made the after taste like it was burned.  The only way I could eat it was to only eat the top and the crust. The entire bottom was awful.  Its my first time with a pan pizza from here so maybe that&#39;s how its supposed to taste I don&#39;t know .  Either way I will never be ordering it again.  With the calzone I ordered didn&#39;t come with anything to dip it in.  Perhaps I should have asked for some sauce. It wasn&#39;t a complete fail I had some sauce in the cupboard I could heat up although the whole point of ordering out was to escape cooking.  
All in all after 2 pieces of pizza I tossed it out.  The calzone was great tasting cooked perfectly, especially with Ragu pizza sauce.  The people that work there were very very nice, the driver was a very nice man who wished me a great night. I can&#39;t say enough about how great the employees are.   I just wish the food was as great as the service.  I appreciate the effort though and wish them well but I don&#39;t think I will come back."

Pros: A Polte man answered the phone to take our order. I state this because a reviewer posted below that a rude female answered. 

We didnt order pizza this time
We ordered , chicken tender appetizer for the kids, Their salad with grilled chicken and the spaghetti dinner with meat sauce.

The order came within 45 mins

Delivery was courteous

Food well well packaged

Comparison:

They made the Chicken Tenders perfectly, soft golden brown and flavorful

Salad was large portion and garlic dressing delcious , I should have asked for an extra cup since thhey are the tiny side pplastic cups.

Spaghetti meat sauce was delicious and noodles properly cooked.
Enough for 3 portions in one order. ( Or two portions if you are super hungry)

When I first called, I spoke with a man that put me on hold to see if they could deliver to the address I had wanted. I waited for quite a while before having to hang up. I called back and spoke to a woman who put my order in no problem and told me it would be there within the hour. I figured as such considering it was a holiday. I had forgotten to mention whom the pizza was for (was having it delivered to a friend at her work), so I called back to let them know. I was hung up on twice, put on hold twice and then told that, even though the order went through and was paid for, that they didn&#39;t deliver to the place I wanted it to go. So I said screw it and thought I&#39;d take care of it tomorrow. So I was extremely unhappy with the services of papa john it&#39;s self. 

That was until the delivery driver had called me and said the pizza was on its way! He even called another time to make sure he had the correct place and waited until my friend was able to leave work and grab the pizza from him. He was such a gentleman and was super kind.

This happen on two occasions. I also called to ask if I could change my online order a few minutes after ordering it, (changing a small to a medium) and although I was informed that it wasn&#39;t possible, (which is fine), the girl who answered the phone seemed a condescending in her tone and rude. I also got my small pizza delivered in a medium box. I don&#39;t care what box it comes in, but I could definitely catch the passive aggressive joke in that, which is unprofessional. The atmosphere also isn&#39;t so great in the restaurant when looking at the communication between management and employees. Finally, the employees are not aware of the ingredients in their products.

Oh garlic butter sauce why are you so delicious. Recently with the competition between the different pizza chains domino and pizza hut; prices for consumers are at the best levels ever. Papa john continues to run deals on the website with codes such as PEPSI50 which gave me 50% off a regular price large pizza which meant that I only had to pay 8ish for a large &#34;the works&#34;. Service is super fast as well as pizza can be done between 15 to 25 minutes. The dough is unique lighter than pizza hut, hand tossed at the restaurant and the toppings here are plentiful as well. Also if you order online you can earn pizza points, once you have 25 you get a free pizza. Also did I mention how awesome the garlic dipping sauce is....

My husband had been craving Papa John&#39;s for, like, EVER.  I would always pick one of his other presented options because I had a PJ overdose when I was younger--it was the only pizza place by us in our old house, and so we had it all the time.  I have honestly avoided it since then.

But my husband caught me at a weak moment, and I obliged.  We got it for pickup at 5:45 on a Friday.  I used their online couponing system and got three medium pizzas (up to three toppings each) and a apple cinnamon dessert pizza for an additional $3.  Our total came to $27 and some change.  Not too bad.

So we ordered a plain cheese for the kids, a banana pepper pizza, and a bacon-sausage-pepperoni pizza (as well as the aforementioned dessert pizza).

When my husband came home, all of the apples from the dessert pizza had slid over to the other side of the pizza, so there were they huge &#34;naked&#34; squares.  See picture for details.

The banana pepper and the cheese pizzas looked ok, but the meat pizza was actually sitting ON TOP of one of the garlic sauces they include with the pizza.  Nice, guys, thanks.  

So the pizzas were just OK tasting at BEST.  Plus, we only live two minutes from the restaurant on a heavy-traffic day, and the pizzas were really cold by the time they got to us.  They needed to be reheated.  

I was not impressed at all, and I don&#39;t see myself returning anytime soon!"

We ordered a garden pizza and a sausage pizza.  The crust was chewy and came with a foul smelling garlic sauce.  
My mom said it was comparable to pizza from a vending machine, while my dad said eating white bread with ketchup would have been better.

Frankly, subsequent to eating the Chicken biryani,  my friend I both had upset stomach - not because of the spicyness, because I am quite used to spicy food but because there was something wrong with the meat.  We ate only a portion of the Chicken biryani. We discarded the mutton biryani completely. 

Both Chicken and Goat biryani had similar taste - almost like they had one common biryani and  that they seemed to have put in the corresponding meat. Extremely oily - unnecessarily so.

I&#39;ve been a frequent visitor to this restaurant since last 6 months but i have to admit the fact that the quality and taste is going down with every other visit..
 
however during my last visit i.e. 2nd oct . the order took ages to arrive which got us to be late at the event nearby. moreover when we brought our grievances up to the manager he wasn&#39;t considerate rather he center argued with us stating it was meant to take long as your order was large, which i felt wasn&#39;t though with just 2 egg curries and 4 naan. Not to mention the constant stare we got from him after the polite confrontation from our side. I forgot to ask his name as i just wanted to have my food and leave ASAP for the event, but you can usually find that guy over the counter. i hope the management do look up to his review and do not turn a deaf ear, as the guy needs to be educated about being polite towards fellow customers.."

Also order Goat Curry which was spicy and the meat was tender i was really surprised ... we very the last customer to leave around 11:00 PM and was not in a mood to inquire or argue as what is wrong with their briyani meat.

It says they open at 11:30, but the the buffet doesn&#39;t start until 12:30.  The place has a very large buffet that runs about $12.  The items have a good selection of veg and non-veg.  The had some good fried things, along with available salad, and fruits.  The paneer curry was awesome and the other chicken curry was ok.  I do like that they bring fresh naan to the table which is soft and fresh.  
We decided to order some Biryani separately (surprisingly there is no biryani in the buffet).  We got both the veg dum biryani and a chicken dum.  Both were excellent.  They are worth the extra $10.  

Also know that the food at Paradise is generally spicy.  The Biryani starts at a moderate spice and can only get spicier.  I LOVED the flavor of the biryani.  Although the items of the buffet were ok, the place is truly a biryani paradise."

Paradise Biryani Point is actually an Indian restaurant chain with locations all around the US. With tall claims, I was expecting more. The biryani itself wasn&#39;t bad though - the meat was tender and the rice was cooked well. It&#39;s just that the flavor was muted and the spices were lacking. The onion salan (a spicy gravy/sauce that&#39;s accompanied with biryani) helped boost the flavor but I still wasn&#39;t impressed. There wasn&#39;t much meat and the portion was just enough to serve two people. Other than that, service was fine and I liked the classy and clean interior. 

It could just be that Paradise Biryani Point is being overshadowed by all of the other good Indian restaurants in the Chicagoland area."

This was my third time and am Very disappointed!! once again. The quality of food seems to go lower and lower by each visit. I had biryani at other paradise franchises in other states. This was the worst biryani compared to other paradise locations!

I use to eat biryani at Jersey city, NJ location almost every other day as a student for three months I lived there. And that biryani was so much better and more quantity compared to this place. Also, I noticed the quantity of biryani served at this location has significantly reduced since my last few visits. Almost by half. 

Worst of- the biryani this time was white cooked rice mixed with biryani masalas, then covered with white layer of rice! Not the proper hyderabadi dum biryani!! 

Final note- I didn&#39;t enjoy my meal - left it unfinished to avoid stomach burn!"

So I&#39;m happy to say that this place lives up to the positive hype- incredible biryani. Perfect balance of spice and flavor in the rice, the onions were on point (burnt appearance but with the nice smoky char flavor without any actual burnt flavor). They even made a special veggie biryani for my mother-in-law, which was just as good as the chicken one. We&#39;ll be back!"

This place has good food and ambiance is decent. Food is slightly spicier.. and again when I tell spicier, its not hot I am talking abt. Its the general spices. They taste good. I would recommend Biryani &amp; Salt lassi for everyone.

Coming to the downside of this place is the service provided by the servers. Not everyone is bad, the guy who is lil bald in the front is good.

if you get a guy who is lean and wears a square shaped spectacles, then you are in for a night mare. starting from asking for plates and spoons till how to serve thing, he absolutely screws up everything. He takes order and brings everything at one shot. he hardly responds to you and is sort of lost. he picked up plates when my friend was still working on it. I had took with such a hype abt that place as he was frm bay area. This guy screwed everything.

Last but not the least, the table size for 4 is really small. I think its a strategy to accommodate more people, but it is really hard to eat that way.

I would actually want to go with 2.5/5 stars, but its not allowing it. Try to believe it."

On my last experience I ordered a to go biryani. Lady over the phone was too arrogant and not even showed willingness to hear an order correction and I had to shout on phone. So I didn&#39;t bother to tip her on bad service, she passed as comment as I went away I just ignored her in hunger. Biryani wasn&#39;t upto the mark. Tasted different. Chicken wasnt good.

Well, with one wonderful experience, I went again for lunch on a weekday and had Biryani once again. The biryani they served this time was a big disaster! I would rate plain Jeera Rice better than this biryani. Unfortunately this turned out to be just another Indian restaurant with most inconsistent food! The price is also slightly on the higher side.

And I had a take out experience too...
I took a Mutton Biryani for $12.20 but the quantity was so less that I had buy another one.
Usually at any other biryani place in Schuamburg, a biryani would be surplus for 2 people but here, its not sufficient for a person.

And the guy who was to take care of the order was astonishingly rude...

When we got inside we noticed the place did not look good, there was no buffet like we got at other locations, and the place smelled. We decided to try the food before judging though. We ordered boneless chicken biryani and paneer makhani with butter naan. I thought the naan was overpriced. The biryani looked amazing. However, the chicken looked red, which is unusual for biryani. The chicken also lacked flavor and the texture was not chicken like, meaning it is probably not pure chicken to save on cost. So, we ate the rice and discarded the chicken. The rice itself tasted good (as did the raita). 
The paneer makhani did not look promising at first bcs it was red in color. It looked like tomato soup. However, to our dismay, it ended up tasting good. We loved it. 
We probably wouldn&#39;t come back here to eat again but if we did we would be avoiding the low quality meat and just eat meatless items. I would definitely order the paneer makhani again but not biryani."

Pros - 
1) Owners and servers were friendly and food was packed properly
2) Flavor of Biryani&#39;s rice was really delicious and met the spicy taste that I opted for.
3) Raita and Mirchi ka salan was served which were fresh and delicious
4) Meat was well cooked and was fabulous.

Cons - 
1) Quantity of rice was very less and it hardly served me once.
2) The goat meat was mostly bones and I ended up having 5 very small pieces to struggle through.
3) Overall felt this to be expensive as the Biryani&#39;s from the neighboring shops tend to serve more for infact lesser price and better meat quality."

They make people wait to be seated even though there are empty tables in the back the explanation is the tables are for 6 people so if you are a family of four you have to wait. until a four person table opens up. the lunch buffet was ok for 10.99 but only 3 types of chicken curries no lamb or goat . The food is ok but  service is horrible looks like  people with no experience in the restaurant  business are running this place. Definitely will not go there again

I went there first time to get some biryani.  Ordered 3 different types and placed my order 30 min prior to getting there.  When I got there they asked me to wait for 10 min.  After 10 min I got up and asked where my order was and they said they did not have my order.  I was like WTF!!!  Then they presumably found my order and after another 15 min wait they give me my order and collect my money.  When I get to my car I see only 2 items given instead of 3.  Went back in and the morons working there said they did not know what happened.  Finally got my food and came back home to find the biryani pretty rotton with meat that tasted like leather and it was full of huge onions.  I mean what a joke!  This place needs to shut down.  Absolutely stay away at all costs!!!

When I mentioned during checkout, the counter lady was pointing blame on the meat suppliers. Sorry but I dont buy that. If you have bad pieces, you do not serve them. The portions are almost 30-40% smaller than other comparable places. Can&#39;t give more than 2 stars."

The short summary of this visit was that customer service can really make or break a restaurant trip. The second note, was that even if your customers are not &#34;regulars&#34; they should all be treated like &#34;regulars&#34; if you want repeat business. I realize that this place makes a ton off their pizza as it is --   but as a family who does not get out that often -- visits like this make me not want to go out at all. It&#39;s not worth the frustration.

We wanted to try White Cottage Pizza &#34;inside&#34; so we could see what the pizza was like since they&#39;d donated pizzas to our kids&#39; school and we really enjoyed it. So when we got there we were confused that there was this restaurant. We saw the carryout entrance for the pizza, then realized that White Cottage really doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s own eat in area -- it&#39;s connected to this Italian Restaurant. 

Once we figured that out, we got in to the waiting area. There was no host/hostess. So we waited.  And waited.  About 5 minutes later of just standing their awkwardly with a couple of other parties, the busser came out and says to the party in front of us, &#34;How many you got?&#34; They responded 4 people. I was expecting to then also be asked about our party. He didn&#39;t even look at me and went back into the restaurant. He told the party in front of us it would be about 5 minutes. And then returned to the restaurant.

About 10 minutes that party in front of us finally sat down. The busser came out and asked us how many people to which we responded 4. He looked in the restaurant and said about 5-6 minutes.  Right then a gentleman came in, a regular, stands in front of us and says that he needs a table for 7 people. The lady who had come out said that they would break up the large table that was there to seat them. 

My husband pointed out that we were there before that guy. So they sat us down. And that guy sat with his party next to us. 

At this point I was already ticked off because of the lack of even getting greeted. We sit at the table. We see the servers walking by us, not even looking at our table. At this point I am wondering if we are even going to get water. 5-7 minutes later -- the guy with the party of 7 at this point already had their drinks and bread and we had still not even been acknowledged THAT WE WERE SITTING THERE.

To sum up the rest of this crappy experience, we ordered a 16 inch pizza, we got a 14 inch pizza. 

We basically had to beg to get our drinks refilled. 

It was so loud in there you had to raise your voice to talk to each other.

It was totally frustrating. 

You cannot use White Cottage Coupons in the restaurant, only in the carry out area -- so we ordered a small pizza from the carryout afterwards since the size of the pizza had been incorrect with our dinner. It wasn&#39;t worth waiting in there for it. At that point I was just over it.  

So all in all, get the pizza via Carry Out if you want it. Don&#39;t waste your time going in - at least on a busy weekend night - unless you want to get frustrated and feel like you are totally invisible."

I&#39;d say the miss here was the avocado taco, but to be fair they offered the avocado raw or fried. I went with the fresh ones but thought it was a little bland.

There was something so comforting about the intimate and eclectic setting when you walk in and folks all around were so welcoming to both newcomers like us as well as the many regulars (which I&#39;m sure I will be one day...).  

The snooty part of me decided to branch out and let the owner convince me to try a &#34;Prohibition Cutty Sark Old-Fashioned&#34; that really packed a good punch.  We ordered several bites to let us try several things (my excuse for piggin&#39; out) and opted for some golden-whiskey chicken wings (yum), bacon-wrapped dates (always a good choice), chatter eggs (deviled eggs topped with sweet chili sauce), an array of street tacos (asada, baja and shrimp---all delicious) and a flatbread topped with extra prosciutto just for good measure!  

Just when we thought we were done, our server made sure that as first-timers, we try the only dessert they have to offer which is a homemade donut &#34;sandwich&#34; filled with a generous scoop of ice cream and drizzled with caramel sauce!  I washed this down with one of the great IPA they have on draft.  

I know they have live music here from time to time so I&#39;ll have to come back then cause I can only imagine that the experience will be that much better!"

My book club with Vernon Area Library meets here once a month (upstairs) and I have also gone on my own and eaten downstairs. The decor is adorable and Chatterbox is exactly what Long Grove needed. It always seems to be crowded, so I hope they stick around for a while!

They serve a lot of craft beers here. I don&#39;t drink beer, so I stick to one of the several ciders on the menu. Recently the bar manager (who is awesome and friendly) has been working on a craft cocktail menu which I am excited to try out!

Everything I have eaten here has been delicious. My favorite thing on the menu was the loaded tots, but they got rid of them. I cannot fault them for getting rid of the tots because they want everything on the menu to be made fresh in the kitchen. My new favorite item is the tomato, garlic and mozzarella flatbread pizza. Although I wish the garlic chunks were cut a little smaller so I can savor it throughout the pizza. Honestly, all the flatbread here are incredible. When selecting a small bite, I recommend the deviled eggs or fried calamari. Oh and the tacos! Yes, just say yes to any of them. The only entree style item I have ordered here was the black bean burger with a side salad (delicious and filling). 

I look forward to my monthly visit to the Chatterbox!"

Last night I met a friend there for dinner and it turned out to be Wing Wednesday, when wing dishes are discounted from $11 to $5, with the addition of some off the menu flavors (Honey Hot, Hoisin and Greek last night).   We sampled 4 different flavors, Sweet Chile, BBQ, Honey Hot and Greek.   The wings were cooked well, meaty, and the flavors were great.  What an unexpected surprise.  Draft beers also on $5 specials.     

On past visits I&#39;ve had the hummus which has been great, as well as the tacos.  

Combine great takes on classic bar food, with a varied beer selection and friendly staff makes this a top area choice to hang out and relax."

It has so much going for it but I won&#39;t be going back.  It has a great location with a parking lot, great ambiance, OK food but crappy service.  I had gone to the Chatterbox once before and had Ok food and lousy service.  I figured I just went on a bad night but nope, same thing.  We went this past Sunday for lunch.  A big party had been upstairs but had left so there were only 3 tables downstairs (including ours) and one couple at the bar so it was not busy.  There was only one server, the bartender, who came and took our drink orders.  As it was noontime we weren&#39;t up for alcohol yet so we ordered a coke and a mountain dew and our food.  The drinks came to the table pretty quickly but we noticed both had a bad funky taste to them - maybe from the well water in the ice?   We did not consume our drinks because they were so bad. It took us about 20 minutes before we saw the bartender again to tell us our food was coming out shortly and while we had his attention told him the drinks tasted really bad and could we get something else that was bottled or canned.  We were told the only thing they had was ginger beer bottled so we passed on that and waited for our food... and waited...

About 40 minutes after ordering, the chicken sandwich was delivered to the table and we were told the Panini would be right out.  It arrived about 10 minutes later.  In the meantime they delivered one meal to the table across the room and I heard the bartender tell them sorry about the wait - and realized that table also had a dish that was delivered well after the others - and that was for the little kid not the adults.  What kind of place serves a kid last?

The food itself is decent and they have some interesting menu selections.  The chicken sandwich has some good seasoning but is a little salty.  I had the special turkey and apple panini.  I enjoyed the flavor combination but thought the bread choice could have been better.  The fries are nice solid slice of potato and IMO could be cooked just a bit more and were slightly underdone.  The food is the only reason I gave them more than one star.  We asked for the bill and were surprised we had been charged $2.75 for EACH of the non-drinkable sodas.  $2.75 for a soda?  I didn&#39;t expect McDonalds pricing but wow.  We didn&#39;t say anything and just paid the bill and left.  I live in Long Grove and try to support the businesses in the community but I&#39;ll just be spending my money at the other establishments from now on."

We wanted to check back in again with Chatterbox and dine there. A year ago was when we went there for the first time after checking out and eating at Chocolate fest. 

We chose to dine outside because it was nice out and had the dog. Last year we had to order everything inside but this time there were servers on their patio. I wasn&#39;t really hungry after eating at Chocolate fest so I ordered one Asada taco and shared their Truffle Fries with my husband. My husband ordered their Asada and Baja (shrimp) tacos. I thought the Asada taco tasted great with guacamole and a lemon Aioli on top. My husband thought the Baja taco tasted better then the Asada taco. I didn&#39;t have a taste of his, but I believe him. Truffle Fries tasted hot, crisp, and fresh. 

Overall food was great! We&#39;ll definitely come back here again!"

A great menu of non typical pub fare. Street tacos and flat breads? Check! New smoker providing rib platter on the weekends (call on that to confirm they have not run out) ok to be honest I like my wings a bit crispier but heck the friendly bartenders and waitstaff offset that ultra minor issue. 

A constant rotation of microbrews and hey guess what the bartenders actually KNOW what they are talking about when you ask about them! A good selection is whiskey..the essentials..makers, bulliet rye and making a special guest appearance ..Laphroaig Mmm hello my old smokey friend!!

So essentially stop in sit in the bar downstairs (usually super crowded). Talk with the bartenders on any new brews and a recommended pairing (you will not be wronged) and relax..

As a special note if you like a cigar..you can walk to Neumann&#39;s cigar shares a parking lot (but also has odd weekend hours)"

Definitely a gem. Good food, good beer selection and reasonably priced in a not the standard fare venue. Glad I stumbled upon it and would gladly recommend.

Seem to experiment with a lot of their own compliments (e.g. Wing sauce, toppings, etc) and they&#39;re all good.

Would have gone five star but both times I was overcharged for something I ordered. Not one to fuss as I&#39;ll just take it off the tip as my time is more valuable than waiting around. That said, would still return..."

From my perception, anyway.

There is an outside patio but we sat inside which was a very small area (is that really all the indoor seating they have?) with seats all around the bar and just a handful of two person tables flanking two of the walls.  As I may or may not accurately recall, there was an upstairs, though it was closed during our visit.  Okay so there&#39;s that.  

We were handed menus, along with a page of daily specials.  Husband ordered a &#34;starter&#34; off of the specials menu which were some sort of walnuts &#34;flash fried&#34; in pork fat.  He LOOOOOOOOVED it.  I ordered us a loaded tater tots (sans the bacon) and vegetarian flatbread.  I contemplated ordering a beer (extensive menu) but opted to stick with water.  Our waiter happened to be a vegetarian as well, which was a nice and random surprise.  Husband ordered three sliders, two carne asada and one catfish.  Everything was very good, but it was the walnuts that received the most raving.  

There was a huge flat screen right in my line of sight that was playing that Palladia tv station which happened to be airing the Isle of Wight festival which pleased me for many reasons.  I got to see some Pearl Jam which got me reminiscing about the two Pearl Jam shows I went to back in the summer of...2003 was it?  I believe it was.  I was a mere 20 year old who accompanied my 34 year old boyfriend/Eddie Vedder worshipper, but I digress.

This is actually a really cool place, I just really hope it doesn&#39;t fall victim to the other businesses in the area.  If this place was in Forest Park, I&#39;d be there all the time for a drink.  Stella Artois on tap, I require nothing else.  Hopefully the locals will patronize it and keep it going."

Though the music was loud (and good) we were able to hear each other and talk. 

My wife is vegetarian and was able to find many choices on the menu.  The wait staff was very friendly, helpful and properly attentive. I say properly attentive because they made sure we had what we needed checked out beer levels and didn&#39;t ask us every two seconds if we needed anything.   We never felt rushed to get out the door so they could seat somebody else.

I got Asian sweet spicy breaded wings. The wings were huge and the sauce was tasty but probably came from a bottle you can find at the asian grocery. The batter fell off the skin as you bit into the wings so the you get a  bite of slimey chicken skin. Not pleasing.  Fried calamari was pretty standard but the dipping sauces elevated the quality. Cheeseburger sliders were meaty but  bland and too well done. On a positive note the truffle oil fries were great. I would come back just for those fries... but probably to go. 

Service: I came here with my wife and my 2 year old for a  Sunday lunch. We were sat in the bar area and the place only looked like there was just a group of 3 ladies being served. Staffed seemed friendly but I immediately got the feeling like this wasn&#39;t a place for a family with young children. Waitress was attentive and didn&#39;t screw up any orders. 

Environment: Seems like the place would be great to unwind after a long work day/week. Place has some great decor and fits well with the bar scene. Staff is young and energetic. Guy at the bar needs to dial it back a bit though. Total dude bro. 

Comments: We were told they were out of fish and chips and pulled pork being that it is the end of the week. Couldn&#39;t the owner stock up on  supplies before they opened for the day? I get this is a small establishment but I felt alienated when friends of the cook came in long after us but was served first. 

Overall I had an ok experience. Definitely not a family friendly restaurant which I assumed it was since it is in historic Long Grove."

They&#39;ve invested quite a bit in getting this place to what it is today. They&#39;ve also invested well in the chef, who is not only a nice guy but also does a great job on the food!

In the many times I have been here the service has been great, the ambiance is awesome and the food is phenomenal with the exception of one person who happens to be the owner. I will now speak to what I mean by this.

I wish that they also invested in a business consultant to teach the owner how to do his job. He has passion and has been part of the scene for quite a while but lacks long term decision making skills and vision. This leads to poor decision making from a customer service standpoint. Every single customer needs to be treated as if they are your most loyal customers. That&#39;s how you create them.

Long Grove is a nice friendly town and most of the business owners do a great job at helping to make it continue to feel that way. Not so much the case here. He&#39;s actually a pretty nice guy...just kind of penny smart and dollar stupid if you know what I mean. 

Invest well in your customers, think long term, keep people happy. That&#39;s how you will continue to grow.

Perhaps when I go again in a few months I will revise this rating. This is such a cool place...it could be so much better....with the right direction coming from the top.

EDIT April 2015:
Owner just messaged me &#34;Go f**k yourself&#34; Glad he was able to take some constructive criticism. He pretty much proved my point for me."

Can&#39;t say that for the management though, service was very slow and not attentive, ( under staffed to have the upstairs area open) wait staff always having to apologizie 
Owner comes and says hi but does not acknowledge the fact they are having issues with their computer system&#39; nor at least say sorry himself and admit he is understaffed. The least he could do is offer some sort of remedy(free drink, coupon off for next visit, etc) anything that would of shown that he cared about his patrons. 
Beer mugs should be chilled, the beer gets warm quickly, like the glasses just came out of the dishwasher. Why would you give patrons soft drinks in a plastic cup? Pretty tacky when you are paying $2.50 . 
You may ask why do we go back because the food is tasty, and not many options if you are visiting family in the Long Grove area.

The tacos are great, shrimp, steak or fish. My favorite is the steak. The beer was really good. The nicest surprise were the people. Everyone that I met were warm and friendly. The owner was floating around helping out and engaging in fun conversation. This place should have never been found by an out of state visitor like myself.

This was one of those places that was so good that I was mentally writing my review while I was still eating. (And I have you to thank, Yelp. I was in Long Grove for the Irish Days festival, and, not wishing to eat a plate of fish and chips off my lap out in the midday sun, did some smart phone searching for the best food option...which turned out to be right across the street. Yay!)

The place was pretty crowded; there&#39;s usually upstairs seating, but as the owner, Steve, came over to explain, they were working on the HVAC system so the top floor wasn&#39;t available. (He also apologized about the heat but I will say it wasn&#39;t uncomfortable inside.) Being an individual diner, I sat at the bar, which can sometimes be fatal: you get forgotten because you become a fixture there, and the servers forget to check on you as they run around. Not so here: I was not only maintained but also had some conversation with two of the bartenders when they had a few minutes to spare. 

My meal was great. I had the trio of sliders (asked one of the bartenders whether she recommended the crab cake or pulled pork; she said the former, but to hedge my bet I got two crab and one pork -- I did prefer the crab). Definitely spend the buck to upgrade to the parmesan truffle oil fries: these suckers are excellent, but rich. 

As to beverages, I was kind of bummed that their cider of choice was Angry Orchard (really? the go-to needs to be Woodchuck, at least, everybody), until one of the bartenders pointed out that they had Vander Mill&#39;s peach cider on tap, which was definitely a step up in quality and uniqueness.  

I was too full to go for dessert, but before I left I had texted a friend to say that it was worth a trip up here just for this meal (I live an hour away). Probably the only negative thing I can think of is the fact that a HUGE tv dominates one corner of the not-very-big dowstairs room, so that&#39;s pretty distracting.

Overall though, great service, great food; definitely the place to come if you&#39;re anywhere within reach of this town. I am not going to shut up about how great Chatter Box is; check it out for yourself."

The upstairs is chill and my date even mentioned that it&#39;s like being in someone&#39;s living room. Kids/families were playing foosball. 

The server was dressed casually. We couldn&#39;t even identify him.

The fried calamari is breaded and seasoned like chicken. I wasn&#39;t a fan. 

The meat charcuterie board is way too heavy. The quantity would last two people the entire evening if we wanted to munch on that. 

The hummus board was great. A few vegetables and pita crisps with a big bowl of fresh hummus."

Was surprised by how small the bar area was but turned out to be a non-issue due to the staffs accommodating spirit.  The three guys working that night could not have been more friendly/helpful.  Knowing that there was not enough seating for our group of 4, they promptly lead us upstairs where they have a much larger seating area.  Being the only ones on the top floor, we had the place to ourselves even though it required a server to continually run up and down the stairs to check on us. This guy must have made 25 trips up and down those stairs for a small party of 4; could not have asked for more.  Oh, and the food, creative, fun and and just plain good."

Brought it to the attention of the waitress and she quickly replied they over poured the first beer. This was my second time at the restaurant and I had the same beers both times. Not a problem with the glass size the first time. Food was good but small portions and over priced. Too many other great restaurants in the area to bother going back here.

A lot of our order was messed up and there so many annoying ticky-tack problems. I think my biggest issue, though, was how badly they over cooked my medium rare burger, which would have otherwise been awesome. 

This place has a lot of potential, and they&#39;re dedicated to being fresh, but for the prices we paid our experience was unacceptable. 

With that said, their staff was very nice. I hope to one day try this place again and be able to amend my review."

If you are okay with that, then you will like it.  Started off rocky.  Went upstairs hoping there were actual tables to sit at.  They are high tops with stools.  So we sat because all of the tables are like this.  The waiter upstairs was too busy talking to his friends to even attend to us so we went back downstairs, where we had to sit at the bar because no tables were available.

Long grove appears to be in a rebuild that doesn&#39;t offer much to the visitor. Oh our joy to have Chatterbox as an option. Not many shops to browse. A lot of empty shops for rent. But to have a place with a very nice chef selected menu and a wonder ranger of micro brews. It&#39;s an oasis among the emptiness. Staff very friendly &amp; helpful. Very reasonably priced. We hope very much they survive everything else Long Grove lacks right now. It was one of two high lights to our visit. The Turkey burger outstanding. The salmon flatbread was wonderful and unique. Loved both and service offered.

My only complaint would be that they don&#39;t have a kids menu and all the seats are bar stools without backs, so it&#39;s not the most kid friendly place.

Our servers were very attentive, with the primary (sorry, forgot his name) explaining the menu and specials. He also noted for us first-timers that the meat was locally sourced and always fresh. 

We started with the 1-pound chicken wings with BBQ sauce. Yum. Six or seven pieces fried with a good BBQ coating. Side of celery and ranch dressing. The wings were crisp and tasty. Other sauces available were buffalo, sweet chili, dry and something else. 

Our entrees were 2 tacos (fried fish &amp; steak) and BBQ pulled pork on potato skins (Saturday special - every day has its own special). Tacos were small, but tasty. Nice layers of flavors. Wished to have bit more cabbage for my taste.  Five potato skins with pulled pork, scallions and other stuff with a side of sour cream. It made an interesting combination.  There were parts of the dish that were more potatoy than porky, but I was satisfied. 

The Chatterbox would be excellent for groups as many of the dishes were shareable. We didn&#39;t have alcohol, but there was a large selection of beers along with some cocktails of the day. Downstairs is a large bar with a few small tables.   

We will go back."

We waited, got a drink and eventually got seats. The statement had me a little worried as we defiantly came for dinner. They have two menus a small plate as well as the specials. Make sure you get both. After the food arrived and we dove into the various items we ordered and quickly discovered this place IS most definitely a restaurant. The food was REALLY good. Tacos, veggie burger and salads were all fresh and creatively prepared. I was defiantly pleased with the food for sure. The service was fast although was defiantly one of those &#34;whadda Ya want&#34; and walk away before u can finish or ask a question type of things.

The burger was well prepared, although the cheese was minimal, that did not detract from the experience. 
The flatbread was a wonderful combination of flavors, just a bit light on the pulled pork. The pairing of pork, Gouda and apples with arugula is complex and just the right sweetness. The edges of the flatbread with no toppings was very dark and very crispy.

I looked at one of the reviews stating there was smoke from oil burners and bad service...disregard that review as there are always trolls taking out their crappy lives on everyone around them. Great place to have some drinks and laughs. Go there and enjoy!

After we arrived our server, Kate, came to us to see if we were ready to order. Seeing as we didn&#39;t have menus a bit of a challenge. Got menus, beer list not updated. Now most servers have a list of tap beers on their order pad.....not Kate. She instructed us to leave our table and look at a board on the wall. So we ordered our beers, after 15+ minutes, another server, Adrienne (spelling?), let us know they were having issues with the tap and brought us samples of other beers......ok, fine. But can we order some food? We&#39;re hungry. No sign of Kate......so Adrienne takes our order. Five minutes later Kate comes over and wants to take our order. (Clueless) Adrienne is the one to finally bring our beers, and deliver our food. Kate doesn&#39;t bother to ask how our food is....in fact my dirty dishes sat in front of me until we left. Kate did ask if we wanted dessert....our friends did. By now her terrible service has become a joke with us, so we timed it......17 minutes after ordering she returned to the table to tell us they ran out. Really? 17 minutes to just found out they didn&#39;t have it?  I hope the owner reads this and fires her.....at the minimum, some training on how to serve a customer. She should be more like Adrienne.......if you go and Kate is your server.....RUN, do not walk to the exit or at minimum a table she has nothing to do with.  As to the food, it&#39;s average and not spectacular. So if the service stinks, why come back?"

Saw the write up in the Herald and decided to try it for ourselves tonight.  Nice list of craft beers - waitress wasn&#39;t old enough to taste them, and offered us tastes to decide.  That works for us!  Loved the menu choices - hard to decide, but we wanted to share, and got the loaded fries - so delicious, and BBQ flatbread - I like my flatbread crispier, but this was very tasty.  Pineapple and BBQ - you can&#39;t go wrong.  Too full to try other menu items, so we&#39;ll have to come back - what a shame....

Enjoyed sitting outside.  They pipe out some music, although there was a guitar player at the coffee shop that would have been nice to listen to as well.

Very consistent and high quality for a pub type atmosphere.  But I would like to see more dinner type food options on the menu.  The tacos are a excellent choice.  So is the Chicken Sandwich.  The beer choices are awesome, so many craft beers on tap to choose from, which is hard to find in the suburbs.  They are constantly bringing in seasonal new tap beers.  The atmosphere is pub like, very casual, wood cabin warm and inviting.  Downstairs is better if you can find a table.  Great classic rock music playing in the background.  It gets busy on Fri and Sat.  I have 2 negatives about Chatterbox.  One, the tap water is terrible because its nasty well water, and the problem is that they Dont sell bottled water.  So this needs to be fixed asap.  Panna water or Fiji, any bottled water they need to sell, please sell something like this so we dont have to drink the tap water.  the 2nd negative is they need one more TV or two more TV&#39;s downstairs so that when you sit at the bar, you dont need to turn around to watch the game.  Its a bit awkward one TV in the corner for the whole room.  Please add more TV&#39;s downstairs.  Otherwise, this place is a excellent Pub, with excellent food.  I will return."

We got 3 small plates between 2 of us and it was enough food for dinner, and it was delicious.  Downtown Long Grove is pretty sad right now, so I hope they get enough business to keep it going!"

I went there a couple times and had a pleasant experience but then I went the last time and I have never been treated so poorly BY THE OWNER. I hadn&#39;t seen my friend in over 2 years and we met at Chatter Box to have some drinks and appetizers. It was a very nice July evening do we sat outside. Towards the end of our outing, we asked for the check, along with another drink. We tipped the waitress and we continued to have our last beverage and catch up. When we were about half way done with our drinks, the waitress told us there were people inside wanting our table, but to take our time. We said thank you, we will be leaving shortly. About 5-10 minutes later a man ( who we later found out was the owner) told us there were people waiting for our table and if we could please hurry. I finished my beer and waited for me friend to finish her wine, as she took her last sip, the owner came and grabbed the glass and my friend told him, honestly, how we were disappointed because we felt not welcome and rushed to leave. Instead of saying sorry, he followed us out, yelling at us telling us that &#34;this is not a place to hang out.&#34; He was very threatening in nature as he followed us to our car. We are adults, we had maybe 3 drinks so we were not drunk or unruly- we simply wanted to relax, have drinks and catch up. So if you are looking for a place where you chug your drink and are rudely walked to your car- please try Chatter Box of Long Grove.

I am a resident of Long Grove and absolutely love downtown Long Grove and have been a supporter of the area for many years. This place does not fit the respectful, friendly, mature atmosphere of downtown Long Grove."

Everywhere they had signs regarding &#39;bathrooms for paying customers only&#39;, &#39;paying customers only in the patio,&#39; etc. I walked in just to check the place out, and was treated rudely; I&#39;m sure its because i don&#39;t fit the mold of their &#39;typical&#39; customer. I thought Strawberry fest was all about walking around and checking out Long Grove businesses, but i guess not. Chatterbox looked like a neat place, but with a stuck-up attitude like that, no thanks.

Three size options and really the mini is great for one person. 

To top it off (no pizza pun intended) they have really good iced tea and lemonades. They also have a compost can for those who like patronizing eco-friendly businesses."

Whether you want to go off of a menu or build your own pizza, you get delicious pizza with any and as much toppings as you would like without additional charges.

I was hungry after a long day but wanted to get something to go. Not a fast food fan I checked out a few options on Yelp and this place drew me in.

When I walked in I was impressed by how easy the ordering process was. There are a fair amount of topping options and all are included at one price!! I stacked up my options onto one of the base pizzas they suggested on their menu wall which was the &#39;dillion james.&#39; The pizza is a generous 11&#34; pizza (they offer 1 smaller size which I believe was 6&#34;). When the order was ready I was also offered an additional sauce. I opted for pesto in a to-go cup. I tried it on a few slices and it was a nice compliment. Not too overpowering but the flavor of the pizza was good and didn&#39;t really need the pesto addition. 

I also opted for a dessert option of cinnamon sticks with strawberry dipping sauce and a milkshake. The milkshake was a nice splurge as you pick a base flavor and can add a mix-in. I chose vanilla with cappuccino crunches as a my mix in. Yummy!! The cinnamon sticks were also good. They were a pizza crest with cinnamon topping and a strawberry puree sauce. The sauce was a greta addition as the sticks themselves had a great flavor but were a tad dry.

I was happy I stopped in as everything was delicious. I wish I had one of these close by at home. I&#39;d be in once a week to try every option!"

My mom liked the fact that the crust was so thin and she was able to load it up with every vegetable she wanted. 
My dad couldn&#39;t get over the fact that you an add any toping without there being an extra charge.

So the boy has this Midwest mindset with food. He loves meat and potatoes, burgers, and pizza. I get that those things are the staple foods for a ton of the male species, but as long as it&#39;s not all we live on I&#39;ll be ok with it! He hit this place up one day not far from his work after being given some lunch monies from a client and he couldn&#39;t say enough about it! So, we decide to venture out to the one near us for dinner one weekend!

This one is hard for me to describe to you! I can&#39;t just tell you what we order because it&#39;s much like a build it yourself place! Yes, there are some menu options available, but I&#39;m not one to stick to the prebuilt menu at pizza joints! So, for your viewing pleasure, I took pics! I don&#39;t do this very often. I should do it more since I do it for my friends when I cook up a storm at home!

Ok, let&#39;s see if I can remember what I had them put on my Mini MOD Pizza... I started with ricotta cheese as my &#34;sauce.&#34; I know, I&#39;m weird! I had them throw on some mozzarella, parmesan, and asiago cheeses. Then I had them top it with Italian sausage, mushrooms, artichokes, and roasted garlic - oh yeah! When it comes out of the oven they ask you if you want it topped and they had this balsamic fig glaze, um yes please!

I also made up a Mini Salad with mixed greens, roasted red peppers, tomatoes, spinach, garbanzo beans, and Caesar dressing. The little salad comes out to be bigger than you think once they throw everything on! In either dish you can add whatever you want! I got the mini of both so I didn&#39;t have too much food, but I ended up with a ton it seemed like!

The boy got a MOD with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, onions, red peppers, and topped it with the balsamic fig glaze! We shared this vanilla shake with sea salt toffee. Everything was really, really good. The shake was a little on the meh, just ok side. The crust for the pizza was great how it crisps up, doesn&#39;t get soggy, and lets the toppings take over the flavor of the pie!

For the price of a pie here, where you can build it the way you like, we will be back for sure! I would recommend this place to anyone! The people were super nice and accommodating when I had to be specific about what I choose. It was a great experience!"

It&#39;s fun making your own pie, and there are lots of options.  I especially like that you can dictate the amount of sauce or cheese you want!  The pizza itself is good.

The servers are very friendly and they take their time to talk you through the ordering. You can order a pizza with set toppings off the menu or you can build your own. Everything is put together before your eyes from the rolled out raw dough to the very last ingredient you add on top. They have a great variety of topping selections, although I&#39;d be nice if they offered some turkey sausage or turkey meatball as well. The drink selection is nice as well. They have some house brewed flavored ice teas.

The atmosphere is nice. Spacious and clean. The bathrooms are all the way at the back of the restaurant and a little out of the way but that may not be a bad thing. I love that the &#39;garbage&#39; has 3 options. trash/ recycle/ compost. Very nice MOD Pizza."

I walk in and find out that this is one of those build your own pizza type of places. This concept has become popular with pizza, recently went to Olive Theory and I have heard of another place called Pie 5. Anyways I picked my toppings and the pizza was ready in less then 10 minutes. One of the things that I really liked about it is that there is no extra charge for toppings. The pizza was decent, seemed a little under cooked.

I also love the fact that they don&#39;t add random additional charges, you can have whatever ingredients you want and as much of them as you want! I was shocked by this! 

You can get a pizza that easily feeds 1 or 2 people for about $8. I don&#39;t get many toppings on my pizza and I still thought it was a great value. It doesn&#39;t take long to make your pizza either!

Went straight to the counter and started looking at the menu... they have set topping pizzas listed on the wall as well as salads but you can just build your own... that&#39;s awesome!  I ordered a simple red sauce, mozzarella, spinach, mushroom, and roasted red pepper pizza... the crust was uh yummy! I&#39;m not going to lie I first thought the crust was a tortilla... it&#39;s not, it&#39;s fresh dough!  My dining buddy ordered a pizza with five or six toppings... no idea but it looked good!  

We got our drinks, lots of choices, and sat down... our pizzas were delivered right to our table and we started to chow down.  I was hesitant at first but the pizza was really good... the crust was nice and charred the way I like it too!  The staff was really nice as they came by a couple of times to see how everything was! We are going back for the pizza for sure.

This place reminds me of a Chipotle.  The build your own style as well as simple decorations, tables, chairs, floor..., but one difference was how the entire staff was enthusiastic about their customers and showed it. As we left they were waiving and saying bye to us... even used my name I had them use for my pizza &#39;sunshine&#39;!

They do not have a dining program which was surprising as the marketing manager mentioned there are 60 plus locations... I think they should get one!"

It&#39;s very similar to Pie 5 and Olive Theory.  My biggest gripes with these places is there are 3 breaks in the flow during the ordering process.  You have to wait to order your pizza, then wait again to add toppings, and again to pay.  Obviously this depends on how busy it is, but this is a mild annoyance in general about these pizza quick service restaurants that have been recently been cropping up.  I don&#39;t really have a solution though.

Other than that, this place is great.  The workers are all very friendly and attentive.  They are quick to explain and answer any questions.  You pick a style  and size, then some toppings, and then wait for the pizza.  I like the fact that all toppings cost the same.  I guess they are banking on a lot of people getting cheese only.  There are some preset options to give you some ideas.  They have a Pepsi fountain machine with some various teas on the side.

It is a big warehouse type of space, which has a cool look to it.  A decent number of seats.  I&#39;ve never seen it packed.  The only real downside is that this shopping center in general is a terribly designed spot for cars to get out of.  It&#39;s right next to ChickFilA and I&#39;m surprised there isn&#39;t an accident every few minutes.  There is almost always a lot of honking and finger pointing though.

Good stuff I&#39;ll be back."

The pizza is decent, but is nothing special. For two people we paid just under $30. I hate to say it, but that is too expensive for a fast casual version of pizza. The garlic bread sticks were definitely a waste of money. I would recommend not getting those as they don&#39;t taste good enough. I got the mega double crust pizza, and it was kind of weird. I wasn&#39;t crazy for that idea, but it still tasted all right.

Overall, it was an OK meal. However, given the prices I would probably rather order from a better pizza place next time."

Soooo many choices, such as having chopped garlic to add at two points in the creation line. The spinach and arugula are very fresh looking. There are spices here, such as Rosemary, that really make a difference on your pizza. I don&#39;t see that anywhere else! 

They also have a few types of fresh iced tea and lemonade being made. Nice touch. 

All in all, choice and vast selection is good here. Everything looks to be of good quality....the meats are even good quality. Also, you can choose between diced veggies or non diced! When I go to a competitor....the absence of these small things really makes the experience seem less. MOD is my fav out of them all so far!!"

Pizza is generally greasy but here you can choose relatively healthy toppings. It is wood-fired grilled so the crust is my favorite; it is smoky, crispy and chewy.

We walked by Panera and saw that this place had opened. It looked like a place that dished out pizza fast, so we agreed to go in the next day and give it a try.

Mod Pizza has a lot of options (except, strangely, wheat crust; something I hope they resolve in the mid-term future). I picked an 11&#34; Tristan pizza, which had mushrooms, pesto, red peppers and asiago. As I wasn&#39;t looking to completely demolish myself nutritionally, I went for the caramelized pear black tea instead of a chocolate salted toffee milkshake. (Next time!)

The pizza was done in roughly 8 minutes, and much like Pie Five it&#39;s served on a super-thin crust with just the right amount of veggies (so that it doesn&#39;t end up soggy). Unlike Pie Five I&#39;d have to say that the crust on this pizza ended up more chewy than crispy, and so I liked it.

I also loved the pear tea, which had just the right amount of sweetness and complexity to it.   

This place is fantastic, and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s close by. You&#39;d be wise to drop by before the line goes out the door!"

My first impression is I think the concept is cool but wonder for me personally, if it will be more of a lunch place than dinner.   

You can choose whatever you want on a pizza - 3 sizes available.   They also have salads and a pizza salad (salad on a pizza crust).    You walk up and pick your toppings or choose one of their 9 named combos.  They put the toppings on and into the oven it goes.  About 5 minutes later, your name is called and you are eating.   They sell beer there as well.

i ended up trying a few mini pizzas and liked the BBQ chicken and basic sausage and wasn&#39;t a big fan of the white pizza.   The vibe is good - help good.   I will go back."

I&#39;ll tell you why...

1. They have a gf crust.  Yes, it is cooked in the same oven as the other pizzas, but I&#39;ve never had celiac issues with that. 

2.  Everything is the same price.  Get two toppings, get all the toppings... Still around 9 dollars. 

3. It cooks in about 4-5 minutes.  

4. The owner was checking in to see how dinner was.  

5. The pizza was so good and I got leftovers. 


Seriously, if you don&#39;t like this place you only have yourself to blame.  You&#39;re the one that picked your toppings.  This place is so legit though, that they will remake you a pizza if you don&#39;t like yours. 


Seriously, just go already and tell your friends."

I like the idea of build your own pizza, especially the speed in which they can crank your custom pie out. This place has a lot of potential but there is also room for improvement. 

Pros:
Price is phenomenal. Around 8 dollars for an 11 inch.
Pizza is hot and ready in like 5 minutes. 
Choose your own toppings. 
Service is friendly and fast. 

Cons: 
Sauce is kinda bland and generic. 
Crust is thin but still kinda gooey. 
Cheese is bland too. 

That&#39;s just for the pizza. 

The place itself is clean and new but the metal chairs and wooden benches are super hard and makes eating uncomfortable. 

They have in-house teas and lemonade. The caramelized pear tea is fastastic and the marionberry lemonade is also a delicious twist on lemonade. 

I think I&#39;ll have to come back to this place a few more times to get a better perspective but for now I gotta stick with 3 stars. Its ok, i&#39;ve had better pizza."

Drove by on a Saturday, saw they were open and went in to check it out. Not too crazy about walking in and having everyone working there yelling &#34;Hello&#34; to us which it seems is their thing to do with anybody entering. Stop that, please.
Anyway, as these fast casual places are popping up all over now, I was curious as to how this place was. Had already been to Blaze, so how does this compare?
As others have pointed out, this is a &#34;Chipotle Style&#34; of ordering. I must point out that I am not a Chipotle fan since I have so many authentic Taquerias surrounding me.
 
Back to the pizza. I ordered a thin crust with mushrooms and red peppers and asked to have arugula placed on it after cooking. They put on such a miniscule amount of sauce on the pie that I had to ask for more and it still was not enough. I passed on any of the meat items because I did not like how they looked. The pizza was underwhelming at best. Sauce had zero flavor, cheese was not cooked very well, the crust was ok. It is just not really for me. I know that there is a niche for these places just like there is for Little Caesars and Dominos but I don&#39;t fit in that demographic. I want the real stuff. Others seem to have swooned in their reviews but I just don&#39;t get it. Maybe they like the price and set-up but I guess I&#39;m Old School.

Just my humble opinion.

Cheers to All"

At the counter they explained how Mod works, pick your size, pick your toppings, etc. looking at the uncooked pizza dough I thought I was getting a tortilla. I decided to go with the &#34;kasey&#34;, the Seasonal Mod. It has olive oil, roasted Brussel sprouts, red onion, bacon, Gorgonzola and a fig glaze on top. I skipped the fig glaze and went with pesto drizzle. 8 minutes later my pizza was done!

First the crust is NOT a tortilla. It is an amazing thin crust dough. It is perfect for the pizza. The toppings were great quality and the pizza was delicious!!!!

I like the option to either choose from their choice of classic pizzas or simply create your own. There are so many delicious toppings to choose from. I can&#39;t wait to come back and have my own Mod."

It&#39;s affordable.I like it so much so, that the first week they were open I am pretty sure we went 3 times. You pick your crust (baby, regular or double crust) and then your toppings. You can add whatever toppings you want and it&#39;s still the same price. As a family where we have two picky eaters and two garbage disposals, this is a great option. And, less expensive than ordering from somewhere else. 

The staff is friendly as well. There are a few growing pains that I am sure will be taken care of...for example, when they are slammed, it tends to be chaotic with people yelling out what they want and the people on the line being able to hear, but that is to be expected. 

The drink selection is wonderful.   The milkshakes, however, not a fan. We will be regulars."

It was a good size for the price and they currently have a promotion going on that any toppings it&#39;s the same price. Issue with the pizza though is there wasn&#39;t very much bacon, I only got four red onions and the roasted garlic wasn&#39;t very roasted. The garlic was almost raw and they were huge whole cloves on the pizza it&#39;s not like it was chopped. The pizza was cooked perfectly; wasn&#39;t over done at all.

With a group of people only took about 10 minutes to get them ordered throughout our line and picked up. Plenty of space to sit and very open feeling-not to mention clean."

My pizzas have been done well and I like the choice in toppings, especially the garlic. One suggestion ... A larger size drink for your to-go customers. The size you have works great when I eat in as I can get refills. However it is kinda small for carry out. I will be back. I love my Lou Malnati&#39;s across the street but when I want something quick a 30 minute wait is rough."

It is commonly topped with a selection of meats, vegetables and condiments. Mod has an Amazing way to eat pizza! All the ingredients are fresh and you can pick off the menu and create your own. It&#39;s like chipotle for pizza.
 My first time at Mod was not like any other pizza place I&#39;ve been too. When you first walk in you see a very large open space with tables and chairs. And the left side of the wall they have a picture wall of collages with a whole bunch of people that either work there or have been there. And on the right side is a huge decal on the wall that says, &#34;Welcome to Bloomingdale&#34;. When your ready to order there&#39;s a path way by the door that leads you to the front where you can order your pizza. They have three sizes of pizza: mini, mod, and mega. The mini is 6&#34; for $4.47 the mod is 11&#34; for $7.47 and the mega is 11&#34; for $10.47 with double crust.  But Mod doesn&#39;t just only sell pizza they also have bread sticks, salads and beverages like: milkshakes, fountain drinks, milk, water etc.  I would consider this as a fast food pizza joint because they &#34;make their pizza on an 800-degree oven that&#39;s gas fired and cooks our pizza in less than 3 minutes&#34;(modpizza.com). Their pizza are made by hand and handled by artisan pizza bakers. As you&#39;re probably thinking... no they do not deliver because their pizza comes straight out of the oven. Which means you can dine in or order for take out. They have an online ordering system on their website and picking up is easy as a snap. The to-go boxes are designed to keep the pizza warm for at least 20 minutes and have reheated instructions on the top.

Ever since I had been here I wouldn&#39;t want to go anywhere else for some wood fired pizza that cooks under 3 minutes. But not just that the staff and owner are very friendly and are full of energy. Right when you walk in everyone greets you and they will make sure to describe everything and anything about the place. But this isn&#39;t just why I&#39;ve been obsessing over this place. In 2008 they opened and started a thing where you select the size of the pizza then create what you would like to put on the pizza with as many toppings as you&#39;d like, for one price. Like a chipotle for pizza. I would compare the style they do here with creating your own pizza at Mod or like creating your own burrito or bowl at chipotle. 
My first time at Mod pizzeria in Bloomingdale, I got to experience this with my boyfriend. It nice to explore something new in the neighborhood so we gave it a try. As were eating the pizza I&#39;m asking him questions like how&#39;s the pizza? What did you get on your pizza? Is your pizza burning hot? Etc. so I decided to interview him about his pizza. After he finished the pizza he tells me that, &#34;I love the fact that I can choose all the toppings I want on my pizza for one price And I don&#39;t have to wait an hour or over just for a pizza&#34;. But I wanted to get more then just one review about this place so my sister was a great person to interview. Her first time going in she didn&#39;t know what to expect she was kind of iffy about this place because it was her first time in here she didn&#39;t know if she was going to love it or hate it. She told me &#34; My first time here I didn&#39;t know what to expect cause you know I&#39;m very picky with where I go and how good the food is. When I found out what I was eating it was a great turnout because I got to choose what I wanted on my pizza but I still got to watch what I was eating and what was on my pizza which was great! So if your looking for a place where you want a good pizza yet your trying to watch what your eating come here because you choose what you eat so you can&#39;t blame anyone but yourself&#34;. The idea of an 800-degree wooden oven is the greatest Idea because it&#39;s a fast moving paste restaurant. Which makes everyone happy and not hangry. This is an awesome and new spot that everyone needs to try because you can&#39;t walk out of there disappointed because you create your own pizza!"

My team decided to order in at work today so I figured I&#39;d give the Italian sub a try. Had a calzone from here one day thru one of my coworkers one day and I thought it wasn&#39;t bad so I figured the subs would b good too.

Speed of the delivery was ok so I won&#39;t discuss that much. On to the sub itself. It seemed a bit dry. Had some nice Italian dressing on it but the flavors didn&#39;t pop out and grab my taste buds like other Italian subs I&#39;ve had from other places. The French bread was a little stiff which made it hard for me to chew into and my contents kept sliding out.

On a positive, it was nice size sub. I&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt. This was a delivered order. It may taste better if I try the sub in person. That&#39;s the only reason I gave them 3 stars instead of 2. Maybe one day I&#39;ll actually visit the restaurant since it&#39;s not far from my job and update my review."

For $2.00 a slice, you can&#39;t beat it. It&#39;s a very doughy pan pizza slice. During the school year there may be a line out the door due to High Schoolers on their lunch break. 
I always get a slice or two, a can of pop and a ranch or garlic sauce dressing to go with my pizza. 
I&#39;ve been coming here for the past 8yrs on a regular basis. Especially when money is tight. 
Hot, fresh slices are the best but even if you go there when it&#39;s slow, the pizza still tastes great.

Crinkle fries. Good cheese. 

Nowhere to sit, that was kind of a drag we were gunna sit for lunch. They have two/three chairs there to wait but other than that. That&#39;s it. Good, hot, ready and cheap! Yes. We&#39;re talking about pizza still.

Read the reviews here and thought it would be worth a try.

Ordered 2 pizzas, one xlarge loaded with stuff and one large lesser for the kiddies.

Asked for both crispy (the secret to a great pizza, IMO).

Was told it would be 20 minutes, arrived for pickup in about 25 minutes.

They were hot and ready when I got there, Used a 5 off coupon and it was still 40.00 for the 2 Za&#39;s. Overall Service was good and efficient.

Got home and opened them up, were we all I impressed?  Not really, just plain thin pizza (not crispy BTW) with a sweeter sauce (no other spices in it that I could taste really)  and lots of cheese.  The toppings were very inconsistently applied, lots of garlic in this bite, none in the next. Pepperoni was skimpy at best.

The sausage and the onion was good\
The garlic wasn&#39;t fresh (out of a jar).

Would I order from here again, Probably not.  The quality didn&#39;t match the premium price.

Was it Bad?  No, just nothing to write home about..

Pizza Bella, Rosati&#39;s and Slice of Chicago all have this place beat with quality and value.

Well we live and learn, sorry Napoli."

Maybe time has distorted my recollection somewhat, but in this apartment full of hungry guys, we each barely managed one slice of the X-Large pizza and passed out. I don&#39;t think we ever finished the pizza because it was just too intimidating.

This is great if you are in a hurry and don&#39;t have any money on you or at least not a lot. However if I am not in a hurry and I do have money on me, I would definitely go somewhere else to get pizza. It&#39;s the perfect place for a hungry highschooler without a job. It does not appeal to me because there is too much dough/crust ratio to cheese and sauce. Having tasted several other pizzas in my life and knowing there is better out there, going here is like getting Mexican food from your local Taco Bell. Oh and before I forget to mention it, this place is carry out only and they do not offer seating. Another troubling thing about this place is the fact that their health and food inspection score is on the wall for the past several years for guests to publicly view and some of the scores are defined as being poorer than I would expect them to be. I wonder why they received such poor scores every time I bite into a slice of their pizza. Regardless, two stars for friendly workers and cheap pizza."

That&#39;s all you really need to know, actually, but if you&#39;d like more details...

When my wife and I first moved to the neighborhood we wanted to find a good pizza place that wasn&#39;t a chain like Pizza Hut, Domino&#39;s or Papa Johns. We found Napoli&#39;s by looking up somewhere nearby, nothing too scientific.

The guy on the phone was nice and open to sharing the daily specials. I even asked him if his pizza was good - and it&#39;s good when there isn&#39;t a moment of hesitation before hearing, &#34;of coarse it is.&#34;

We&#39;ve picked up and had the pizza delivered. In all instances, the pizza is hot and delicious. It&#39;s extremely cheesy and the topping always taste fresh. Is this a gourmet pizza shop? No. Is it forgettable? No.

Whether it&#39;s just you and someone else or if you&#39;re feeding a small army, consider Napoli&#39;s for your local pizza cravings. You won&#39;t regret it. It&#39;s good. :)"

Awesome, just awesome.

The &#34;Chicago Style&#34; pizza, which was enormous, was ordered and the family was unable to finish it (maybe I should stop thinking with my stomach and their stomachs....). The crust was soft, a tad sweet, doughy, and topped just right.  Next time I will order sensibly and highly consider the thin crust.

I went here for the first time and was blown away by this northwest suburban pizza-by-the-slice hole in the wall. There is no seating, just a window you walk up to and order your food. The guy behind the counter wasn&#39;t particularly friendly, but not rude either. I got a large slice of cheese pizza and a liter Mountain Dew for 5 bucks. My friend, my brother and I then went out to the parking lot and ate out of my friend&#39;s hatchback while listening to the Cubs v Sox game.

The pizza definitely exceeded my expectations. If you are one who loves pizza crusts, this puffy piece of heaven is for you. The cheese isn&#39;t all too impressive, but the sauce has a good spice to it. After one slice I felt like taking a nap, but my brother and friend kept on with a second piece. The reason I gave Nap&#39;s a 3 star rates was definitely the location. Napoi&#39;s in next to a really sketchy looking liquor store complete with a creepy pee-soaked bum that heckles you for change. I would not feel comfortable going there by myself or with a group of girls. 

The experience was overall enjoyable, apart from the bum, and if you find you and some friends driving around looking for food on a hot summer evening, I would definitely suggest Nap&#39;s."

The $2.00 slices are an excellent choice for a quick, cheap (price wise not taste wise), and filling lunch or dinner.

The new place seems larger but has lost something in the plain decor. Still looks like an Applebee&#39;s minus the bar.

The food is good but pricey. Service today was okay. Waitress was pleasant but side of hash browns was delivered well after main meal and not done to my request (I like them crispy). Coffee delivered promptly.

One thing kinda cheezed me off was that I ordered short stack of blueberry pancakes. After looking at what I thought was a high breakfast bill I noticed that short stack of cakes was $7.10 with blueberries adding an additional $2.00 making it a total of $9.10. A regular order of blueberry pancakes is only $9.00. That&#39;s bass ackwards right? Proper waitstaff would have noted that. That&#39;s a lotta green for average pancakes.

So $28 (not incuding tip)  for pancakes, waffle, hash browns and coffee (wife drinks water) is a bit pricey in my book. You can find similar quality elsewhere for a bit less money."

Anyone familiar with the area will agree that the Egg Basket on this side of the street is much more visible to a passerby and the ample parking is a welcome change. 

I try avoiding Sunday brunch for obvious reasons but it&#39;s hard saying, &#34;No&#34; to a dad who seldom offers going out for breakfast or spending any time with his elder daughter on the weekends.

When we arrived, it was a full house! Every chair and booth were occupied, except for this makeshift table for two that was tucked away in a corner next to the front desk but situated in a way that whoever sat there would be seen by everyone who entered, exited, walked by and worked at the restaurant. The hostess seemed apprehensive about asking my dad and me if we&#39;d sit there or wait 10-20 minutes... I think she was getting used to being turned down by everyone she asked before us. We&#39;d rather eat than wait to be seated.

The location has changed but everything else about this place is same ol&#39; same ol&#39;... Right down to the coffee refills being slow to come by. The breakfast entrees are average and familiar but cost more than other restaurants with the same concept.

That is why this place is 2.5 - 3 stars. I don&#39;t crave the Egg Basket..."

Now onto the food, my blueberry pancakes were OK, I do love their batter, its nice and thick and has a great crust to it, however, the blueberries were lacking.

Their new location is easier to spot than their last and there is ample parking. The inside is very nice and has plenty of seating arrangements. 

I ordered biscuits and gravy with eggs and sausage which was prepared incredibly fast. I only had to wait a short time for pancakes. Their service was very friendly and very attentive. 

Overall I really liked the new location and setting. Their service was great including the fact that I had a server in training. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."

The amount you received for your buck was great. They are truly failing now. We came for lunch about a month ago chicken tortilla soup. What we received was jalape√±o soup. Not kidding it was LOADED  with them and no chicken. Was told cook was on vacation and someone else was cooking. Had to pass on their soup. 
The Mexican skillet breakfast with skirt steak was worth $11.95. Meat was tender and the serving was worth it.  In September we noticed a change in the breakfast. Smaller portion of meat hash browns were soggie. Then Today the meat was tough didn&#39;t taste like skirt steak. The Server Chris puts the plates on our  table they weren&#39;t hot. She didn&#39;t give us napkins didn&#39;t ask if we needed anything else. We ended up talking to the manager about it. Then Chris comes over to see what the problem was. Our food was cold but the eggs. Then she rolls her eyes. If you don&#39;t like your job then go somewhere else. I know waitresses look forward to tips and you can tell the hustlers!!!! She Still didn&#39;t come back. I don&#39;t know who is cooking or purchasing the meat but it&#39;s poor. I raved about this place now I am disappointed."

outside of that, the food was actually pretty good.  but after that kind of treatment, i won&#39;t go back, and i&#39;ll tell anyone else that asks, not to go there either."

The place was packed but for a Sunday morning at 10 am ,the wait was minimal (just over 5 minutes.) We were led to out seata in the very crowded dining room and were seated in a nice little booth.

A woman came around and offered me coffee and a short time later a gentleman with water. It was just a few minutes before the waitress came by to take our orders.

I ordered the spinach and feta omlette, my son the mickey mouse pancakes and my daughter the chocolate chip pancakes. The portions are huge.The kids loved their food. I cannot say the same for mine. The feta tasted funny.

Coffee and water service came around regularly. The waiter staff was very nice but the food is just okay.

My husband and I have a tradition of going for breakfast after voting and before work each election day and we decided to give this place a try.  The ambiance itself is fine, lots of tables and a decent amount of folks talking over coffee and eggs, and no wait,  but that could also have been due to it being a Tuesday.  

Our server was friendly enough and the menu was large.  I asked what her favorite omelette was and ended up going with her suggestion.  But it&#39;s now Saturday and I can&#39;t remember the name even though half of it is still in my fridge and won&#39;t be eaten at this point.  What I do remember is that the omelette was pretty unmemorable.  

And that is the word that can basically sum up all of our food: unmemorable.  The hashbrowns were just ok, the pancakes also ok, the slice of melon that came with my meal,  warm,  definitely not fresh,  and therefore gross.  My husband opted for a turkey sandwich and fries and wasn&#39;t thrilled about the portion.  He did say that the turkey tasted real as opposed to like lunch meat so I guess at least there&#39;s that? 

If I lived in a small town and didn&#39;t have any other breakfast restaurant options, I would be alright with going to the Egg Basket.  At least once in a great while.  Fortunately, I live in the suburbs and have many, many awesome options.  I don&#39;t think that we will be returning anytime soon."

However, our waitress today explained that the table set up that they had allowed more people than the older one. 

Now to the food part. This place has never disappointed me. Maybe if I was picky about the wait times like some people I would complain, but since I&#39;m not I love this place because their food is always fresh and delicious. Today I visited the new spot for the first time after my 10k muddy race I did along with my family, and as any runner or athlete would relate, after a good and rough workout, one is starving. I ordered a vegetable omelette which turned out to be a avocado omelette because I ordered to put avocado on my omelette (which the veggie doesn&#39;t have), and substituted hash browns with fresh fruit which was very fresh and very delicious. 

Will definitely keep coming back to this place because it&#39;s my to go spot after a race I have."

As mentioned in other reviews, that&#39;s a busy time and we had a 10 minute wait.  They handed us one of those buzz round discs (which weren&#39;t working) but it was numbered and the hostesses regularly kept coming outside when a table freed up to find the group who was next.  (Was obvious they&#39;ve done this before as they had the system downpat really well)

This was our first visit to Egg Basket ever (though we&#39;d eaten at the old location they took over, which was an Applebee&#39;s many times).  Service was good though tables were a little cramped, especially if/when there are little ones standing in the narrow walkway.

Two of us ordered skillets and they arrived hot and well cooked.  Someone else ordered an omelette which was also well prepared, as was the 4th meal.

The only interesting thing was the omelette order asked for &#34;half cheese&#34; (he has lactose issues with too much dairy) and the waitress who took our order immediately mentioned she&#39;d write it down but not to be surprised if they didn&#39;t do it.  She didn&#39;t say if that&#39;s cause of the cooks being so busy OR if it&#39;s because the cooks don&#39;t like special orders.  As she warned, the omelette did come with the full cheese.

The waitress, overall, was friendly and competent.  One person asked some questions and she was able to answer them, discussing what the ingredients were and how they were prepared very well.

Overall, we had a good time and would definitely go there again."

Half the time I go the teenage employees all look annoyed that you&#39;re there and taking up their time. They barely crack a smile. I&#39;ve worked retail for a decade. I know how customer service works. They do not. 

Every single time I&#39;ve ordered a pickle they have forgotten it. I stand there waiting trying to get their attention. Even after the cashier told them twice, they still forget. 

I have to say nothing&#39;s ever been wrong with my sandwiches but I&#39;ve never done the delivery. I&#39;m always ordering in the shop. This is the only redeemable thing. 

Today on the way there this black pickup truck was tailgating me and driving around 55-60 in a 35. He was cutting people off, tailgating and not using a signal. Horrible driver. Get to JJ and sure enough he pulls up and turns out to be one of heir delivery guys. Don&#39;t order delivery because he may kill someone just trying to get you your sandwich. They really shouldn&#39;t hire 16 year olds who just got their license last week. 

Then to top it off who ever he was, either the manager or assistant manager was yelling at all the employees multiple times as loud as he could. Apparently he was missing order slips. Which I get is a big deal but instead of screaming in the middle of the place he could have taken people aside or in the back to train them on what to do with the order slips. Not make all his customers uncomfortable while he screamed and threw a tantrum. Unprofessional.

Even though the sandwich itself is essentially the same, they cannot be compared.

Service here is relatively good. So, stopping for a quick lunch to take out with you is convenient and easy. But, a turkey sub with chips and a small code for almost $11? That&#39;s just crazy talk. It ain&#39;t worth $11."

Today my boss gave us the choice of Thai or JJ. I unwisely chose Jimmy Johns. We ordered the sandwiches around 11:30.

No sign of a delivery driver at 1:00, so we called. According to them we either never ordered or they lost the ticket... Ok, mistakes happen. The sandwiches were the. Offered on the house and &#34;rushed&#34; over.

1:30 and the sandwiches arrive. I open my sandwich to discover some crusty green goop that I suppose could pass for guacamole. Now, your next thought should be &#34;why are you complaining about the quality of guac from a sandwich shop?&#34;. Ordinarily you&#39;d be right and I&#39;d just pass it off as ordering the wrong thing from the wrong place. The issue is I didn&#39;t order anything with guacamole. I look at the ticket, and I see the number of the sandwich I ordered... So it seems that they heard me right, but still couldn&#39;t get the order correct.

I got back to work and opened it to see that there was no meat on the samdwich. Just lettuce and tomato. Mistake made but the person preparing, annoying, but generally not that huge if a deal. I called the store expecting that they&#39;d deliver a new one since it was their mistake. I spoke with the manager named Angela who was SO RUDE on the phone. She said it was too bad and they don&#39;t fix sandwiches by bringing new ones. No matter if it was their mistake. Now that&#39;s even more annoying. So asked her what her solution for me was since I already took my lunch break to get the sandwich the first time and I needed a lunch. She suggested that if I don&#39;t have time, I won&#39;t have a lunch. She offered for me to come in after work. How silly!! I went there for lunch, why the hell would I want to go there after work. I decided to take the time from work to go in, I was pretty heated with what the manager said to me. I walked in and the first guy I saw I handed the sandwich that was made wrong and he was very kind. He apologized and made me a new one. Kind of sad when the hourly employee is more respectful than their manager. I asked to speak with the manager and she ignored me until her workers had to tell her THREE TIMES that I was waiting to speak with her. She said &#34;what?&#34; And I just simply said &#34;can I speak with you&#34;. She proceeded to ask me to wait more. Rude. But she was making sandwiches and they get busy, so I get it. I was recording this whole visit for my references since I wrote in a complaint originally through their website. She refused to speak with me. I told her she didn&#39;t need to say anything if she didn&#39;t want to be recorded, that&#39;s fine. I told her I had a complaint and all I wanted was her to listen, as the store manager, so she could work on her customer service.

The other issue I had with this location.  They had like 6 to 7 kids all under about 22 and were not friendly.  They gave this fake friendliness and gave the impression that they hardly cared.  To this owner, I wouldn&#39;t take advantage of lowly paid teenagers and get some adults into the mix.  I didn&#39;t like their attitudes and didn&#39;t appreciate them looking frustrated from the previous customer in front of me.

1.) placed order online for delivery. No show after 2 hours, I called and was told their driver didn&#39;t show. Have to pick food up but still charged $1 per item delivery fee on card because online and in store are 2 different systems. 

2.) placed order over the phone for delivery. Asked for bread to be left in, cut in half, with peppers. Receive order with bread out, not cut in half, and no peppers. But I was charged for peppers and receipt shows my order listed as I requested. 

3.) attempted to satisfy my sammich craving one night and pull up to the store. Lights are on, people sitting outside, and the door was open. I&#39;m not talking just unlocked, I&#39;m talking propped open. I walk inside and immediately told they are closed. I get it, you want to go home, but I didn&#39;t notice a sign with hours posted (might have missed it, I&#39;ll admit) but leaving the door open during closing duties is unprofessional and unsafe. 

Not to mention the countless times I&#39;ve been in there with someone&#39;s personal iPod blasting music laced with profanities. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m no angel myself listening to profane lyrics while standing in line behind a family with small children is not an ideal place to enjoy that type of music. 

If you are a true die hard JJ&#39;s fan, maybe you can look past my unpleasant recollections and continue to support this careless franchise. I however won&#39;t waste anymore time and would rather visit Mike from Jersey across the street from now on."

My customer service experience at this store was God awful... This place got my order wrong THREE times. 

(I will say this the customer service at their HQ is phenomenal, which identifies the cause to seemingly be this store management and not the franchise in it&#39;s entirety. )

After getting my order wrong thrice, I called the store spoke to a person named Martin. Martin is clearly not qualified to be on the phone when a customer has a complaint. He&#39;s not  empathetic at all. Not once did he admit fault, instead he kept asking me was I &#39;sure I order the right thing&#39;. I asked for the manager, and he said he was the manager. I said I couldn&#39;t believe it. And asked for an explanation as to why my order has been wrong on 3 separate occasions recently and his response was, which didn&#39;t make sense, &#39;what do you want me to do about it&#39;. So I asked what their store number was (which he initially didn&#39;t know what a store number was) and admitted he is only the assistant manager and the real manager Jorge wasn&#39;t in.

I called corporate and they had to call me back, which they did and I spoke with 2 very polite people who took my situation seriously, contacted the store manager and owners. Not even 30 minutes after hanging up with the customer service rep, the store manager Jorge calls. He apologizes and insists I should call corporate back and tell them the situation was resolved because &#39;it would look very bad for the store if I don&#39;t, please, call them back&#39;. He attempted to bribe me with free food. afterwards I explained to him that I told corporate that I don&#39;t want free food OR my money back. They clearly have a much larger issue with their hiring/training process at that location and my goal is to just save the next person from having to go through the trouble of a bad experience. 

Jorge exclaimed that they&#39;ve had trouble out of the this person Martin before and that he may be with the company in the upcoming months. I said, firing him wouldn&#39;t fix the root cause of the issue....as this is bigger than firing someone. My recommendation was to instead TRAIN him and if he isn&#39;t trainable then he doesn&#39;t belong there because at that point he doesn&#39;t want to be. however, due to their lack of process control they&#39;ve lost me as a long-time customer. Jorge insisted that i accept the free meal and that it&#39;s free for me just for my trouble and he&#39;ll use a promo code. &#39;I said, ok, thank you, I&#39;ll take you up on it to give it another shot&#34;.

I did call the customer service rep and said that the store manager offered me a free meal and that I would give them a second chance.....THIS IS WHERE IT GETS GOOD....

TODAY, I&#39;m in the area going to Chipotle (practically next door) i said to myself i will go and get my free meal just to see what the experience would be. I walked through the door and asked for Jorge the manager,...he wasn&#39;t there. i said &#34; i had some issues yesterday with my meal and Jorge said that i can come in today to pick up the free meal.&#34; Keith said, &#34;oh, no i didn&#39;t hear anything like that in fact i was told not to ever deliver to you again!&#34; I said excuse me? Martin then called Jorge to verify what i stated. Jorge verified it and at that point, my level of disgust is so high i just left. 


POINT IS DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE."

4 times I received bread that was so old and stale that it crumbled as I was holding it and trying to eat it was like eating sawdust.  The last time this happened I was at the store, so I went up to ask for a fresher bread they told me their bread is all made fresh.  That is when I took my sandwich and knocked it on the counter asking them if that was normal for fresh bread before walking out.  What a joke.

My family and I once ordered for delivery - which apparently this location considers 45 min as freaky fast for 3 sandwiches to go less than 2 blocks away....   but all of us had something wrong with our sandwich.  The vegetables were way too cold with no taste, which probably means this location freezes their stuff to save money... the lettuce was gross and had to be taken off - and surprise surprise - stale bread.

Sad, because the other Jimmy Johns locations nearby have never given me a problem."

The problem is the online ordering/delivery.  Twice they have screwed up my order and now twice they have just cancelled my order with no notice.  If you order food after 8pm, it&#39;s a crap shoot whether they&#39;ll deliver or not.  And if they don&#39;t you don&#39;t get any heads up... after about 10pm you&#39;ll just see the status change to &#34;cancelled&#34;.  That&#39;s a ridiculous way to run things.

October 3, 2012. We have a client coming in from out of town. We decide a quick and easy lunch would be Jimmy John&#39;s. We place an order online. After about 5 minutes, we learn that we need to add something to the order, so we call to add to it and they say they will take care of it without an issue. Lunch arrives (a little longer than anticipated) but it was good. I really don&#39;t have anything bad to say about the food. It was fine.

October 31, 2012. We receive our credit card statement with two charges from JJ- the first one being the total of the order we placed online and the second charge being the final total once we made the changes to the order. We contact the store. They tell us that they will fix it and we should see a refund within 3-5 days. We receive the next statement in November ...no refund. We call to get this issue resolved, they say that they took care of it, it should show up on our next statement. December comes...receive the statement...no refund. Now, we&#39;re perturbed to say the least. 

We contact the store yesterday to try once and for all to get a refund. Speak to a kid (no name) that can&#39;t seem to fix this without the manager, Mike, so we are instructed to call back today at 11 (&#34;the start of Mike&#39;s shift, but Mike likes to come in late, so it&#39;s best to call closer to 11:30&#34;---this is just so unprofessional, it&#39;s disgusting). We call today at 11:30, speak to Joe; now I have to give our friend Joe a little credit here, because he was the most helpful out of all the people we got passed around to.

Joe tells us that we cannot have a phone number for the owners, Brad and Sandy, but they usually are at the Chicago or Hanover Park Locations. We Google the HP location, call, ask for Brad. &#34;Sure, just a moment, can I tell him who&#39;s calling?&#34; -My colleague provides her name- &#34;Oh, he&#39;s not in right now&#34;. &#34;Well you just said he was there and now that you know who this is, you he&#39;s gone?&#34; Weird how that happens....huh? She explains to the person who answered the phone that this is a customer service issue that needs resolution and after being given the run around for 2 months, it&#39;s getting old and she wants to speak with Brad. Brad gets on the phone. He explains that its lunch time and they are very busy, he would like to call her back. We have been waiting for a call back since October 31, 2012. This is really getting out of hand.  She explains the situation to Brad who I&#39;m guessing knows exactly what the problem is and he says he will get back to her because he needs to look up the receipts, etc. (which there is only one receipt---the one we signed when they delivered)

We decide that it&#39;s time to call corporate. This is just a joke....we call. They say there is no one available in customer service. So we say that we&#39;ll hold. &#34;ummm, we don&#39;t have a hold option on our phone system. Once the person is on hold for a minute, they get kicked back to me&#34; Well, duh!! That&#39;s how phone systems work so people do not sit on hold forever, genius! &#34;Ok, we&#39;ll leave our info and you can call back&#34;. They call back shortly thereafter. We explain the situation YET AGAIN, they say they will contact the store owner to get this resolved. POOF! Within 30 minutes, we got a call from the Elk Grove store. MAGIC! They refunded the $$ immediately and faxed us a receipt minutes later. My colleague addresses their terrible customer service and asks why it&#39;s so difficult to have gotten this taken care of...he literally said &#34;I don&#39;t know, but you got it taken care of now, so it&#39;s resolved&#34;. Yes, you resolved the refund, but you have lost my business and every other employee at my local company that dines out regularly. All for about $35!"

Ordered the bruschetta mix (traditional, artichoke and eggplant) which is filling itself (3 of each for mix plate) and shared Montana which has mushrooms and prosciutto which were done super fast and it was very good.  Even had a left over for pizza in the morning!

All in all, great pizza place.  Although, it can be pretty small for 2 people to share, if you add the bruschetta mix for appetizer, you should be pretty darn full.  Did get to try their wine collection since I was going to the shooting range after but the list looked pretty good also."

I was at the McDonald&#39;s across the lot a few weeks ago &amp; wondered how it was so now I had to try it.

Came here last night, got a medium with our favorite  toppings on just about any pizza: Sausage, spinach &amp; hot Giardinera peppers. It was reasonably priced for the money, 14 bucks &amp; some change for a medium.

When I got home &amp; opened the box, all of the ingredients were beautifully laid out on top but there wasn&#39;t enough cheese on it to hold them together so sure enough I lost a lot of my ingredients as I ate the pizza. The sauce was good but in my opinion there wasn&#39;t enough to taste the richness of it which is a main highlight of good pizza so all I really tasted was my toppings.

I knew this place was going to be small, as it was in a small space in a strip mall. When I walked in, it was packed! I had to sit at the bar and wait and then a couple more people after me were waiting, so total 3 groups waiting. That was a really good sign, especially on a weekday. While waiting I watched the workers prepare the pizza dough behind the counter, watched them also put the pizza into the brick oven, and looked at the menu.

After waiting for 20-25 minutes I finally got seated. I ordered right away, my mom and I had a Hawaiian pizza and wine. 

When our pizza arrived it was better than I expected. The dough was perfectly light and soft with a great taste from the oven. This has to be in the top 5 pizzas Ive ever had. I will be returning soon and will try the white sauce pizza and will try to come earlier in the weekdays to try and see its less busy during that time."

The detail that goes into making this pizza... COME ON, the native Italian who owns this pizza place even chops his own darn wood out back to feed the fire that crisps up the fluffy lightly browned crust. This freaking pizza is GOOOOOOOOOOD. Neapolitan style through and through from the perfect aforementioned crust to the wet center to the way it&#39;s served whole and cut only at the table to be eaten with knife and fork.... yum. &#34;This looks good to me,&#34; my carb avoiding dinner mate remarked before blowing her diet and inhaling pizza. S√¨, s√¨ lo fa. 

And did I mention the individual sized pizzas we got were only $12 each? Waaaaaaaaa!!! Pizza that tastes this good can cost twice as much in places with pricier real estate. Elio&#39;s pizza is a bargain for the quality provided. Seriously, i want to throw pennies at the people that complain about the pizza so they can get some sense. The pizza here is just about as good as it gets without going nuts on certification or 100% imported niche ingredients that would drive up the cost.

5 stars for Elio Pizza On Fire well deserved. nummy num num."

First couple of  times were fine except for one time when the waitress forgot to put in our order. Now the last 3 times for cary out I have had 2 problems. 
A.  the pizzas were NOT COOKED IN THE MIDDLE. Could not even get a whole slice out. I needed a ink blotter to get the middle out.
B.  Every time I order off their website and go to pick up its ALWAYS  a higher price then what&#39;s on the website.  Not a little over , but 25% higher. I just have a feeling that the employee&#39;s are getting complacent and their Web guy passed."

Bruschetta best I ever had (they offer about 5 different varieties on the bruschetta-we ordered the traditional). Pizzas melt in your mouth, they use quality ingredients-no acidic tomatoes, mozzarella was delish! 
Tarimisu was ok- was not thrilled with it. Saw a Nutella pizza I will try next time. 
Only drawback was very small space, the seating was very tight. We will definitely be going back regularly. 
It was really nice that the owner/chef said thank you for coming and acknowledged his patrons. 

Update: we have been coming here weekly since first review, service has gone down hill. Only one server usually, and that&#39;s not enough when they are not stellar servers. After waiting 10 minutes I finally got up and got my own soda from the fountain machine! Food still great- definitely needs service improved!!"

It&#39;s one of my favorite places for Neapolitan pizza...with no shortage of variety..

Some of you may or may not know, but Elio&#39;s Lincoln Park location has closed.. 
This is not due to lack of business, but more about splitting with his partner...I am just sad that those in the city will no longer reap the deliciousness of his pie...yet, we all know the city has no shortage of awesome wood fired pizza joints...

I have to give Elio props for being a stand up guy who really cares about his customers and his food...His Italian good hearted nature never goes unnoticed...and he really treats his customers like family...his prices are very reasonable, his portions generous and..
his ingredients are FRESH...I feel like I get a taste of Italy anytime I eat here...

I&#39;ve tasted almost every pizza variety on the menu and my recent visit included a first!
Dare I say, WURSTEL pizza?
Did I ever think I&#39;d be inclined to eat hot dogs on my pizza??  NO....never crossed my mind, never had a desire, thought it sounded gross...BUT because it was featured on Elio&#39;s menu, I decided to give it try....everyone eats hot dogs right?  its just cut up dogs on a pizza...
I know your thinking dogs on a pizza is disgusting,
but it really sounds much worse than it tastes....
I gotta tell you...it was actually not bad and somehow it works with the sauce, cheese and crust.  The fact that he uses quality beef franks makes all the difference...is it Vienna? I have no idea, but it sure tasted like it...
Some pieces were sliced lengthwise while others were nugget sized...The hot dog/pepperoni combination was a good one....a little heavy/greasy, but definately better than I imagined.  Would I order this again?  probably not...but if someone offered me a slice, I wouldn&#39;t be turned off by it...give it a try!

The Capricciosa is topped with fresh plum tomatoes, mozzarella (not fresh bocconcini), artichoke hearts, ham, mushrooms and kalamata olives..I&#39;m not really a fan of ham on my pizza, but I enjoyed the ham Elio uses and I loved all the other toppings.  The ham is more like a prosciutto cotto which just means the ham is cooked by boiling or steaming rather than crudo which is cured ham and what most refer to as prosciutto...Italian ham has a different texture and richer flavor in my opinion versus reg baked or boiled ham.

I never cared for Elio&#39;s sausage in the past.  He used thinly sliced cooked sausage and I always wondered why he didn&#39;t use Italian fresh sausage....maybe it had something to do with the oven temp and cooking...but it was just strange to me.  Those days are gone as my sausage pizza looked completely different.  Crumbled sausage covered the top...if your not a fan of crumbled, you may not like this...I think its a change for the better compared to what he had..
It was tasty, but I will say this pizza was greasy though...

The Burrata app is one of my favorites and is a HUGE portion..it comes loaded with a mound of fresh arugula, about ten slices of good quality prosciutto - - I love that it is not salty and has great flavor...Kalamata olives, a nice serving of burrata and includes sliced flatbread. This is so good...and meant to be shared...great size app for roughly 3 - 4 eaters....less than that, and you&#39;ll have leftovers w/your pizza...Burrata is always fresh and creamy and paired with prosciutto and arugula makes this extra special ;)  The Caesar salad is another fave too...it is enormous! 

And finally, the Ruvida! (cannoli crepe)  I&#39;ve had this a few times and it always hits the spot.  Elio has 3 crepe combinations, but I love cannoli anything so if your a fan too...try it.  The filling is perfect, and its not overly sweet...He also has a Nutella and Bianco-Nero crepe (mascarpone filling with espresso)....that sounds good too...

Our pizza&#39;s were on the charred side this time....didn&#39;t really bother me though...yes, sometimes they can be a little undercooked and sometimes a little over charred...but...
I still love Elio&#39;s anyway..."

The bruschetta has a perfect balance of basil and tomato and it&#39;s piled on 6 slices of Italian bread. I went for a work lunch with one coworker and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. I had a calzone which was crispy and delicious from their stone oven. My coworker had a chicken salad that was not only tasty, but also quite large. We could have split it between us, two grown men. Really 5 Stars!

Timeliness and ambiance cost them a star. We were the first table in the place and still took a bit.  We had an hour lunch which ended up more like an hour and 20 minutes. That oven cooks pizza at an incredible rate but the wait for both bruschetta and then our meals were long. Then, my calzone came out 5 minutes before my coworker&#39;s salad, which was kind of odd. We asked for the check a couple times and then finally once were already way too late we just went up to the front to pay. 

As far as ambiance, playing unedited rap threw me off. I&#39;m not asking for Italian music and I&#39;m no prude, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s appropriate for a business to go that route during the lunch hour.

I would still go again without question; the food was that good. Just make sure you don&#39;t have a timeframe, or make it clear you have a set amount of time."

It can be easy to miss, but it is worth visiting. It is a casual atmosphere. They have plenty of eats, but it is also good for take-out. There are a few appetizers and other entrees, but it&#39;s all about the pizza. They have a number of different combinations. From the ones I have tried, they are all very good! Light on the sauce, thin crust, plenty of toppings. No Chicago deep dish here, but that&#39;s ok!

The service was good. They do have a few alcoholic beverage, and also your regular sodas/water/etc. We did have an issue with the soda (the coke was mixed with the root beer somehow?). But that was a minor nuisance. 

The pizza is worth coming back for!"

It&#39;s a very small space, so no where to sit when it&#39;s full. There was a long line of people waiting and the servers seemed very stressed. The wait was going to be 40 minutes so we decided to take our pizza to go instead. The pizza itself took a while to cook (20 minutes) which is surprising because Neapolitan pizza should cook within 3 to 4 minutes. I tried the Rustica pizza and it was okay - not very memorable or flavorful. My fiance did not like it, and we both generally love all pizza. I would come back again to try a different pizza when they are less busy...but overall I felt like this place was run by people who had no idea what they were doing in terms of service because of how chaotic it was at 7 o&#39;clock on a Friday night with the wait for pizza that should take only 4 minutes to cook."

The service was fast but just ok and the price/value wasn&#39;t satisfactory for me.  Yes, I&#39;m cheap, but I think $11 for a single pizza is a bit over priced.  $9 bruschetta- same - overpriced.  

Let&#39;s talk pizza... I love their dough and that it is brick oven baked, so amazing.  I think my problem is that I hold every pizza joint against the pizza joints in Italy... I know, I know, I should go back to Italy and never eat pizza here so I can stop complaining.  Ok, got it!.  The freshness and taste of the ingredients are ok, but to give it a fair chance, next time I come back, I will try something different.  I am dying to be blown away.  I ordered margherita pizza and added italian sausage.  The best thing about this pizza was the dough... the toppings-- mehhhh...  
The bruschetta was pretty straight forward- I got the &#34;mix&#34;  so there were 3 traditional with tomatoes, 3 with artichokes, 3 with eggplants, they were great!

I will most definitely come back to try their other pizzas and their crepes.  I have very high hopes!

My only hope for improvement... They need to expand... TheY have a great product so they can bring in a crowd. But in time, I&#39;m sure they will double or triple in size.

Try any of the pizza&#39;s, Burrata, Caprese or the Sicilian sampler.

The menu is not overwhelming and is quite simple with a couple main categories.

On our first visit we ordered a margarita and &#34;etna&#34; pizza which was garnished with kalamata olives, artichokes, ham and basil - delicious! Also tried their bruschetta, a couple different dinner salads, and some fresh burrata. Second time around we had tried 3 other pizzas and none disappointed.

If you know Naples style pizza then get to Elio&#39;s. This is not Chicago style pizza, more like New York style with a chewy crust. Sauce was not sweet nor chunky. Toppings were generous but not too much. I&#39;m not a cult of personality person but the owner was genuinely warm and friendly, it really improves the experience when you know the guy watching over your dinner cares whether or not you&#39;re enjoying it.

The pizzas are good for 2 if you get an appetizer but if you&#39;re a big eater get your own. My husb and I each ordered a pie and each took half home. He got the Bufalo mozzarella pie. That one is all about the special mozzarella. I got the Capricciosa pie with ham, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and cured olives, a nice combo of savory toppings of varying saltiness. The crust was crisp and chewy. The wood fire oven gives it a distinct flavor and texture. The ingredients were fresh and sliced the right size in order to be cooked perfectly in the short time a neopolitan pie is in the very hot oven.

We started with a Caesar Salad to share and the dressing was not the creamy mess you get some places, it was homemade I think, very flavorful with homemade croutons and thick slices of aged cheese.

We got dessert to go. The tiramisu is definitely homemade, it was creamy and it was delicious. Even though we make it here at home for special occasions, I would order it again at Elio&#39;s.

It&#39;s a small place, maybe 8 tables and a counter, reminded me if the neighborhood¬† pizza place where I grew up in NY except with a wood burning oven. I heard them chopping wood out back!

I&#39;ll totally drive an hour each way to go eat here again. I didn&#39;t want to write this and tell everyone how good it is because it might get too big and famous but it&#39;s been on TV so secret&#39;s out. Really good."

Close to us, and decided to go there for dinner. One of the best decisions I&#39;ve ever made, when it comes to food.
It&#39;s in a small strip mall, you may miss it if you&#39;re driving fast down Lake Street.  Parking minimal but we didn&#39;t have any trouble looking for one since it was on a thursday night. We had Pizza Rustica and it was good. Family also had Elio Super salad.
Will definitely be back here again."

The cannoli is rich but light and full of a proper cannoli flavor!  My wife and I have tried many pizzas across the nation and this ranks up there with some of the best we&#39;ve had.

We came on a thrusday night.  Service was horrible.  We sat down, were given menu&#39;s and then ignored for like 15 min.  The owner comes by to ask how our meal was, and we tell him that we hadn&#39;t even ordered yet.  He took the order and put it in, and brought the drinks himself.  ($2.25 for a soda is too much).  The waitress brings the pizza, and we don&#39;t see her again.  After we are done, we&#39;re waiting for a while.  She&#39;s just sitting their talking with a bunch of friends.  

The pizza itself was horrible.  No oregano, no flavor to the sauce, and the cheese was this imitation cheese that had a huge pool of oil in the middle.  As you picked it up, the slice would come apart.  No spatula, or cutter to cut it...we used our knives to do it ourselves.  The sizes were horrendous.  My 4 and 7 year old finished a cheese pizza by them selves, and were still hungry.  My wife and I had another for ourselves, and the same. 

Save yourself the time, and money.  Pop in a frozen pizza, or get a $5 pizza from somewhere else and save yourself the trouble."

We ordered a Margarita and Funghi. Prices are great. The Margarita was PERFECT, very thin, flavorful, perfectly cooked. On the other hand we found the Funghi to be too salty and a bit overcooked... probably just a fluke considering the perfection of the other pizza.

As an apology for the small wait, the incredibly friendly owner offered up a couple sodas on the house, insisting on it. He gave us the good stuff too, Pellegrino orange and blood orange sodas! (Love the blood orange oh man.) Will definitely be back to try some other pizzas."

Pizza was really good, especially the Rucolina. The arugula was fantastic, crust light &amp; crispy. Very yummy. The second pizza we had was the Rustica with mushrooms, which was just okay. 

Was a bit surprised to be served paper plates &amp; plastic cups, but not a huge deal. Service is slow at best. Friends came in &amp; owner&#39;s wife seemed more interested in chatting then taking care of us so we could leave... A bit annoying but not a deal breaker. Only other oddity was the competing pop music and tvs behind the bar. Both were at the same volume, so couldn&#39;t really hear either.

It&#39;s hidden in a strip mall with a small parking lot.  The place is not so big, but enough for you to come and sit down for a quick bite to eat.  It has about 7 granite tables of 4 and 6 high top chairs by the cooking bar with a window view of them making their pizzas.   
The one time I waited for my pizza, the place did get pretty warm due to the huge brick wood oven.  I wonder how this place would feel when it comes to summer time. I&#39;ll be sure to be eating my pizza outside then.  
I noticed, the Addison locals come here speaking Italian, kissing cheek to cheek. They have a friendly staff and they have two flat screen tvs to watch while you are eating your meals.
They now serve real plates and silverware, before it was those paper plates and utensils. I see that they serve wine and beer here as well.
The pizzas are Neapolitan style and the owner even chops their own wood for the oven.  Something like hickory, apple and maple wood.  They use floured surface for the pizza, not cornmeal.  And it takes the pizza just a couple of minutes in the oven and BAM, delicious crispy crust on the outside and soft and chewy in the inside.  And the toppings fresh ingredients and so simply made.
Even the Hungry Hound came here, there&#39;s a video of the owner
I&#39;ve tried mostly take out, but I plan to come here to sit down and enjoy my meal one of these days.
I enjoy their pizzas, but they also sell fresh focaccia artisan sandwiches, traditional sandwiches, salads, and two types of pizzas (red sauce or extra virgin olive oil base).  And don&#39;t forget Italian desserts too.
So for, I&#39;ve tried the following:
Quadrifoglio (mozzarella, fresh greens-spinach/arugula/radicchio/grated cheese flakes, EVOO),
Rucolina (mozzarella, arugula, prosciutto, parm cheese flakes, EVVO), Sausage with mushrooms,
Pepperoni, and Hawaiian all were so good.  I think you can also request certain toppings for you pizza so don&#39;t be shy to just ask and for how much.
But my favorite is the sausage and mushrooms.  The size of the pizza can feed two adults or if you&#39;re really hungry then plenty for 1 adult.  
The Nutella crepe was nicely done.  It was equal part crepe with Nutella, I&#39;d get this again.  It&#39;s enough for two or lets be greedy plenty for 1.  
I checked their website, I wish there was more appetizers and a better view of their menu.  It&#39;s kind of hard to read what the ingredients are in their specialty pizzas, you can&#39;t even expand the menu so tiny writing.  I want to save a tree please, so update your menu.
Overall, I&#39;ll have to go back and try their other items like their freshly made Focaccia sandwiches and salads.  But a MUST to have a pizza too lol chow!"

Because, dear friends, I was eating inferior pizza for the duration. Standard chain delivery or dine in was my dinner du jour. The time had come to step up my game.

I&#39;m training for a marathon. I need carbs. Delicious, satisfying carbs. My training buddy turned me on the the delight that is carb loading with pizza. I was a little leery of this tactic, but resolved to give it a try.

Now, all my long runs will be brought to you by Elio pizza, woodfired to perfection and consumed with reckless abandon. My husband and I went here and wedged ourselves into one of the highly sought after tables on a Saturday night. What the service and ambiance lacks the food makes up for. I don&#39;t care if I have to eat the pizza in a back alley, I&#39;ll do it.

We ordered the mixed bruschette because choices are hard. The eggplant bruschetta is amazing - there&#39;s sweet and savory and salt notes throughout that just make the toasted Italian bread beneath sing with delight. I was concerned I might be full by the time the pizza arrived, but I was sufficiently motivated to soldier on once I got a whiff of that delightfully toasted cheese atop a slightly charred thin crust and delicately places pepperoni slices.

This was a great change from the stuffed pizza pies our are is known for for. The crust was crunchy and thin, leaving me full but still ready to hit the road the next morning.

Dessert didn&#39;t have a chance in hell stacked up next to that pizza, but there&#39;s always next time. I can&#39;t wait to try all the unique combinations - I think the Buffalito will be next on my plate."

We ate at Spacca Napoli the night before, so we had an immediate basis for comparison. These pizzas should have a char on the crust, but one side of each of our pizzas was simply burned. Limited and uninteresting beer and wine selection. Pricing was fair."

The wait was definitely worth it, especially with the owner taking a break from the wood-fired brick oven to pour us some wine in appreciation for our waiting. We started with the bruschetta which was perfectly sweet and tart, with the perfect amount of basil to give you a pleasantly floral finish. Then the pizzas- probably some of my favorites that I&#39;ve had in the Chicagoland area with smoky charred crusts, just enough crunch while the dough remains chewy and delicate throughout, cheese melting and oozing but not overwhelming the beautiful fresh veggies, cured meats, and beautiful olive oil. I&#39;ll definitely be recommending Elio&#39;s to anyone looking for a nice Neapolitan style pizza and I myself, can&#39;t wait to go back to try their sandwiches and calzones. Yum."

Sicilian roots, they came over and eventually decided to switch from a bar that has food as a side, to a pizza place that has drinks on the side... and a great choice to switch it was!  His wife was there to consistently check on us, chat with my 1 yr old nephew, and tell us about their history.

Elio tells me his pizza isn&#39;t Neapolitan, and based on his bake times and crust, he&#39;s right.  His crust is crisper on the outside, but still light and airy (not soft) after you bite in, and it&#39;s a very solid pizza!  He makes a pizza that suits his tastes, which is what any great pizza maker does... customizes to what he likes, and shares it with the world!

My sister, sleeping nephew, and I tried the following (well, the sleeping nephew didn&#39;t really eat... just woke up and checked out the flickering flame decorations the whole time):

Margherita - A pretty standard pizza, I like to see how this is made at different places.  Basil is shredded and put on with dollops of fresh mozz.  Nice, clean, simple flavors, as always, one of my favorites.

Capricciosa - My sister, having just come back from Rome, was craving artichokes.  This pizza had it, along with fresh mushrooms, olives, and thin slices of ham.  Let me tell you, this pizza was LOADED.  Unlike the more traditional Neapolitan style, every bite was packed with different toppings... very generously loaded, and the combination worked well! 

Verdict:  Spectacular customer service, wonderful pizza, very reasonable prices.  I look forward to bringing the wife here to have a meal in the future!

Insider tip:  Elio and his wife revealed to me that they&#39;re about to open in Lincoln Park for their second location!  City dwellers, keep an eye out... Elio himself will be making the commute to make sure the pizza is up to par!"

They have upgraded from paper plates to real plates. Considering that they have raised their prices since opened, I&#39;m glad they have upgraded their plates for dining in."
elio-pizza-on-fire-addison,Jennifer S.,mYvZwQ3T5JzqwOyURQWA_w,"Bartlett, IL",1,1,1,344,6,x4omRHsUkW0lBCLd1aJFvQ,4.0,2012-12-02,"The pizza was rocking!  I don&#39;t want there to be any confusion about that, but our visit to Elio&#39;s was weird. 

As we were walking up, we commented that the open sign wasn&#39;t lit up. I started to think that maybe they were closed at 2pm on a Saturday. We tried the door and it opened. They just didn&#39;t have their sign on. 

When we walked in, a young girl curtly acknowledged us. There were four of us standing there. We would like to eat. This seemed foreign to her. Moving along, we took a seat and she brought over menus. 

We ordered drinks.  A diet coke, an ice water, an iced tea, a sprite and an orange fanta. We were informed that they don&#39;t have ice. I&#39;m sorry. This is weird. Isn&#39;t it?  What restaurant doesn&#39;t have ice?  We end up with cans of pop and the plastic cups that other reviewers mention. I guess that I&#39;m fine with the plastic cups and paper plates, but would prefer that they were a bit more green with plates and cups that they wash. It&#39;s a lot of garbage especially when they are throwing away plates and cups that people didn&#39;t even use. 

We were trying to decide on an appetizer, but two of them just had a random name and they weren&#39;t described on the menu. We asked the waitress what they were. She didn&#39;t know, but said she would ask. I&#39;m glad she offered to find out or I think I would have been done right then and there. The cook came out and described the two apps. We ordered a caprese salad and shrimp cocktail.

Five minutes later, the waitress comes back to inform me that they are out of shrimp. I am annoyed. Places run out of things and I should be more empathetic, but the waitress was not informed. About anything. If you&#39;re out of shrimp, tell the waitress so she can inform the guests when they order. 

I don&#39;t eat caprese salad, so I just watched the rest of our party eat. They needed salt and pepper. There wasn&#39;t any on any of the tables, so we requested it. The poor, uniformed waitress didn&#39;t know if they had a salt and pepper shaker. The cook knew and directed her to the set. She brought over almost empty shakers. Again...weird. 

We had ordered a panini and three pizzas. My son liked his panini, but only ate half because he really liked the pizza instead. My sister and her husband had two pizzas. One was covered in roast beef and the other had prosciutto and some other things. I went with a white pizza and added prosciutto. I was expecting crispy prosciutto. It was just tossed on after the pizza came out of the oven, so it was lukewarm and chewy. I took a bite of the pizza and the entire slice of prosciutto came off with it. The flavors were good. The crust fantastic!  But the execution (on my pizza) was off. Weird. The pizzas that they had were great and they really enjoyed that portion of the meal. 

A couple other things to mention.

The menu is projected on a screen when you first walk in. Cool. This is probably helpful for making menu updates easily. 

They have a couple tv&#39;s that were easy to see from the tables. Cool. 

The menus were left on the table until we were done eating. Weird. 

I think there is some confusion about if they are a carry out joint, a fast casual eat-in restaurant or a nice place to have a leisurely dinner. Beautiful marble tabletops, a brick oven and the comfortable booth space made me want to linger.  I am convinced that the cans of pop, lack of ice, lack of real tableware, lack of knowledge and the brisk attitude make this a prime carry out place. Weird.

Two more things. There was an annoying fly through the whole meal. It was making us crazy!  Not necessarily their issue, but I was annoyed already and the fly made it worse. Finally there was this conversation:

Customer to waitress: May I have a receipt?

Waitress: Oh, would you like one?

Customer: Um, yes. 

Why would the customer ask for a receipt if she didn&#39;t want one. D&#39;oh!

Five stars for their pizza (other than my non-crispy prosciutto) and their awesome oven. This is why people love Elio&#39;s!  Two or three stars for everything else. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s bad training, an employee who doesn&#39;t care or maybe even a cousin or something helping out for the day. It was weird. But, I know that I&#39;ll go back and that the pizza was really that good. You get four stars, Elio&#39;s."

This is a small place in a small strip of stores.  It&#39;s a little hard to see from the road - we passed it initially and had to turn around.  Tight parking in kind of a weird spot but we got in and out ok so that was fine.

We got seated right away.  The inside is pretty small - it&#39;s a very cozy place, to be sure.  It took a few minutes to get our orders taken.  Drinks arrived - the pop is in cans - but the pizzas took a few minutes longer to make.  It was pretty busy so that was ok.  

We ordered a white pizza and a regular sausage pizza.  I&#39;m not usually a white pizza fan but this one, which had lots if cheese and extra-crispy prosciutto on it, was very very good.  Excellent crust and great flavors.  The sausage was ok - the crust was a little done and the sausage had a flavor we weren&#39;t used to.  It wasn&#39;t bad but I think we all liked the white pizza better.  They did both have a nice wood fire taste to them.

Cost-wise, we probably couldn&#39;t have fed 4 adults for less.  It&#39;s a pretty good deal for the amount of food."

We came with a large group and started out with the Caesar salad and the assorted bruschettas. The salad portion was enormous and fresh, definitely a win. The bruschettas were the real star of the beginning of the meal though, each was better than the last. I fell totally in love with the artichoke bruschetta, the artichokes were perfectly seasoned and not too heavy, I could eat them everyday! 

For my meal I had the rucolina pizza. The crust was so light and crispy and definitely hit home on the brick oven front. I also tried the Hawaiian and the 4 Formaggi, both were also excellent. 

I would highly recommend Elio Pizza on Fire to anyone looking for good pizza in the suburbs. It&#39;s a family owned business that definitely cares about it&#39;s product which results in an outstanding meal."

The pizza was so soft and floppy that I felt like I was in a completely different restaurant. Everything I loved so much about their pizzas was gone!  No crunch whatsoever. I felt like I was eating a large breadstick with cheese on top. Our waitress just wore a tank top and skin tight sweats that made her look as if she was lounging around at home getting ready for bed. Sorry, that last detail bothered me a little. I figure if you&#39;re working in the service industry, you should wear something that is more appropriate. We also wanted the bill to be split in half, but somehow one receipt had 2 pizzas on it while the other had 1. I guess she didn&#39;t understand basic math either, or just couldn&#39;t figure out how to split the bill on the credit card machine. I thought that would be a common request amongst diners!  Oh well. I would like to return in hopes that the pizza I loved so much will be back...it may have simply been a different person making the pizzas. If so, there needs to be more consistency."

The pizza crust is perfect. The eggplant on the pizza Ortolana should be a lesson to all American cooks on how it should be done. Very friendly proprietor and staff. Just a wonderful little place.

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t speak Italian so that idea was kind of a bust. 

I don&#39;t really speak Spanish either, but I can fudge a few words here and there. So because I really want this review to have a little more spice, so imma go for it. Listo?

I wasn&#39;t feeling too caliente today. 

I think it might have something to do with lack of sleep... like quatro days of not uno.single.wink, plus, on dos of those days I just flat out forgot to put anything in my body that wasn&#39;t either coffee or a popsicle. 

I finally got dos and a half hours of sleep last noches... and then had to be shaken awake only to have take mi novio to the aeropuerto, and say adios to him for the next tres weeks while he &#34;gets spun the darma and comes back enlightened&#34;. 

Then I went home to trabajo... but I was still so cansada and slow that I lost track of time and before I knew it, I had to be on the move again for a work meeting almost an hour from my casa. I felt so caca-y that I didn&#39;t even wear make-up. Cara de changa. 

Then I went home to finish trabajo-ing some mucho and feel really really gross. C√≥mo se dice, blech!? (That one&#39;s para tu, Dana G)

Then I decided I needed a peque√±o pick me up from the day and a break from staring at my laptop, so I pack up the Prius and headed over to mi abuela&#39;s casa for some QT with Gammie. It was here that she decided we should go to comida. Perfecto idea, Abuela! 

I chose Elio Pizza On Estar, as I&#39;d been there before and had a feeling that if there was any way for me to feel better, it was to have Elio and Abuela time together. 

Did it work? Infierno si, it did! 

On mi first visit I just had the pizza... and it was m√°gico. On mi second visit, Abuela and I went all out and opted for a pizza, panini, and dessert crepe. 

The pizza: delicioso, as always. 

The panini: Grande! ... and scarfed in a matter of minutos

The crepe (cannoli cheese and chocolate sauce): So bueno. So bueno, in fact, that mi Abuela could not stop raving about it. 

The bill: Loco cheap! It&#39;s actually kind of hard to spend $20 on dos people here it&#39;s so cheap. 

The only thing I&#39;m not a fan of? No tap water. You have to buy a pinche peque√±o bottle of agua. I think maybe it&#39;s because the place is so peque√±o they don&#39;t have a dish washer or real cups. Your pizza comes on a ceramic plate, but customers eat off peque√±o  paper plates and for dessert they give you plastic-ware to eat with. Kind of strange, and I really do hate that I can&#39;t just get a glass of agua and have to waste a plastic water bottle, but their customer service tops and their product is loco delish making it a prime place for a perfect fiesta. 

Hasta la vista, Elio!"

Owned by an Italian family, this is no cheap-wanna-be-Italian-food joint. The brick oven cooked pizza is delicious with many original varieties. Unlike American pizza which is often heavy on the crust and tomato paste, Elio&#39;s offers classic pizza topped with anything from pineapple to salmon. And the bruschetta, oh my goodness is it good! Topped with tomatoes, artichoke, tuna, spinach... one of my favorites. It is a small place, located at the end of a strip mall, and a great aspect of it is how you can see the owners making all the food right in front of you, plus the European feel. Prices are very reasonable, just be careful of showing up on a weekend with a large group because that place gets packed!"

What I&#39;ve learned is I started out pretty strong. The Biancaneve is still my favorite pizza that I&#39;ve tried. Since then I&#39;ve tried the bacon and Hawaiian pizzas. The bacon pizza was almost too floppy to eat. The bacon wasn&#39;t crisp so it just tasted like ham. Not to say it wasn&#39;t a good pizza, it was still yummy, just not what I was expecting. The Hawaiian pizza was pretty yummy, and a bit adventurous for me. I never thought I&#39;d actually try it, but the other person I was with wanted to try it. It was pretty delicious!"

Best Neapolitan style pizza ever found in the USA, and frankly even better than many pizzas I had in Italy!
Extremely fresh and first quality ingredients. The pizza crust is unbelievable, and the WOOD fire brick oven give it the perfect flavor (and look).
Food is great, the owners very humble and hard working.
By the way, their salads are also VERY good!

The place is small but inviting. The only thing I would &#34;upgrade&#34; a little bit is the silverware and replace the paper plates with real ones... I know, I know, but those flimsy paper plates... Uhmm...

Nevertheless, we travel about 45 minutes to enjoy their wonderful food and we can&#39;t wait to go back already!

The wood burning oven keeps the place nice and warm. We sat right by the oven and saw all of the deliciousness coming out of the oven. There were only two people running it. The person making the pizzas and one server. So if it&#39;s a busy day, be prepared to wait. We gladly waited. And boy, it was worth it!!!! We ordered two pizzas. I ordered that Margherita pizza Rossa and my boyfriend ordered the Italian Beef pizza Rossa. It was beyond delicious. I want to go back again today!!!!! I definitely suggest this place.

Pluses: Pizza was pretty decent, very jovial atmosphere, seemed privately run.
Negatives: Service wasn&#39;t the best, lots of standing around by the staff, sausage seemed a bit off, a bit expensive for what it was, a little tight to sit in.
Recommendations: Check their white pizza with prosciutto, it was great."

Food:
Biancaneve ($7.45) - pizza without tomato sauce, contains (White) Mozzarella, Garlic, Oregano, Fresh Basil..it tasted good, but a little bland or something just seemed to be missing for me...the crust was delicious tho..

Food Portion: if you order one pizza...it&#39;s more than enough for one person&#39;s meal....but if you eat a lot a lot.. then maybe you can get 2 pizzas....they give you a lot for the price since you&#39;ll have leftovers..

Parking: plenty of parking spaces during lunch hours...

Atmosphere: small and simple..people come here to eat lunch...

Customer Service: the staff were friendly...

Thankfully, our &#34;tour guide&#34;, Adrianna was there to help us choose from their incredible pizza menu.  For most of you, this is unlike any pizza you have ever had.  You don&#39;t order a sausage and mushroom or pepperoni, onions and green pepper.  No, no, no... you&#39;ll find amazing items like Rucolina, Primavera, Pirata, Gusti, and Dolcezza on the menu.  That&#39;s where the lovely Adrianna comes in.  She&#39;s both translator and tour guide as you explore the authentic Sicilian pizza landscape.
Here&#39;s what we had:

Mediterrenea Salad - A nice sald for two to share with romaine lettuce, fresh tomato, red onions, Calamata olives, sundried tomato, cucumbers and liberally drizzled with their own balsamic dressing.  This is a wonderful start for your meal.

We decided to order 2 pizzas and share them and take the remainder home.  Our first choice was the Ortolana which is topped with fresh plum tomato, mozzarella, grilled eggplant, grilled zucchini, roasted red pepper and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.  This was a wonderful veggie pizza option!  We sometimes get bored with typical veggie pizzas because it&#39;s the same old, same old.  Not at Elios.  You can really taste the freshness of the ingrdients.

The second pizza we ordered was the Rucolina.  All I can say is &#34;WOW!!&#34;  Fresh mozzarella, arugula, prosciutto parma, grana cheese flakes, and extra virgin olive oil.  Sounds simple right?  We added red sauce per Adrianna&#39;s suggestion and it was quite frankly one of the best pizzas I have ever had!

We finished with about 5 slices of pizza to take home for the next day.  Now here&#39;s the best part - we had a salad, 2 pizzas and 3 sodas.  Cost = $29.49.  Yes, you read that right, just a shade under 30 bucks.  I have spent 3X the amount at some restaurants and not enjoyed my food as much as I did last night at Elios.

Let me offer a few tips that might help you better enjoy your experience:

1) It&#39;s a real P-I-T-A to find because there is no obvious sign blaring out &#34;ELIO ON FIRE&#34;.  When traveling on Lake Street, enter the strip mall parking lot just east of the McDonalds and directly across the street from the entrance to Sal&#39;s Beverage Depot.  (It&#39;s the strip mall on the south side of Lake with the taqueria right when you turn into the lot.)  Elio is at the opposite end of the strip mall at the very end.

2) IF you enjoy wine and beer with your meal, find a place to park and cross the street and grab yourself a beverage at Sal&#39;s Beverage Depot.  Adrianna said that people are welcome to BYOB.  NOTE: They do NOT serve alcohol.

3) When dining as a couple, whether to order one pizza or two?  If you are really hungry, I say &#34;go for it!&#34; and take the leftovers home.  Not that hungry and want to save a few bucks, share a salad and a pizza.  Throw in a nice bottle of your own wine and you can get a decent meal for two for under $50.    

4) Bring cash - they don&#39;t take credit cards.

5) Ask for Adrianna - she&#39;ll take good care of you!  Be sure to leave a nice tip.

So there you have it.  A new, family owned restaurant in the heart of Addison serving some of the best pizza I have ever had.  I haven&#39;t been this excited since discovering Bigby&#39;s!"

We ordered 2 original beef sandwiches to go. Thirty minutes down the road we opened the bag and discovered Italian sausage sandwiches instead. The receipt stapled to the bag was correct; the sandwiches were wrong. The girl bagging up the sandwiches didn&#39;t seem to know what she was doing. At first she tried to give this meal to the man who ordered before us and it wasn&#39;t his either. It is SO frustrating when one is already on the way and has no recourse to fix lousy service.

Normally, I wouldn&#39;t review a fast food place or give a bad review but after numerous complaints and an email or two without a response - they have it coming.

The last three salads I have ordered - the lettuce was wilted and brown.  My co-worker and I each ordered a 7&#34; beef through the drive-thru.  When I opened by sandwich - there was literally 3 pieces of beef.  Her sandwich was overflowing.  I called and complained and was offered a new sandwich. Got the new sandwich and there wasn&#39;t much improvement.  More beef, but dry.

This last time I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich with pickles.  The chicken was so overcooked, it was dark brown, dry and so hard it was difficult to cut.  I sent an email with picture - no response.  Sent a second email, with a picture of the sandwich and receipt - still no response.

Needless to say - quality and consistency have gone downhill from the time they opened to now.  The fact that they can&#39;t even acknowledge an email.  Sorry - I&#39;ll stick to Portillos."

I ordered a dunked cheesy beef, cheese friends and a meatball sandwich.  When I got home the cheese spilled in the bag which was unfortunate.  However the real problem came to the beef sandwich.   It barely had any meat on it.  I had way too many bites that did not contain any meat or barely any meat and it was cold.  It also was still dry in some areas even though I asked for it to be extra juicy.  Seriously disappointed by the beef.  Good flavor but a cold, dry beef with barely any beef is not acceptable.  Looks like I&#39;ll drive further to go to portillos or big sammys next time."

The set up is kind of different form what I&#39;m use to in a typical sandwich/pizza place.  If you haven&#39;t been here before (I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the same layout like the other locations), in the front of the entrance you pick up a menu and walk through the left side of the room where the open kitchen is located.  There, you can see the staff making food like a pizza station, salad, and sandwiches.  During lunchtime, sometimes they display what the popular meals looks like.  

My friend and I use our Entertainment booklet coupons of buy 1 salad/pizza with a drink and a side and get 1 salad/pizza for free.  So our meal split comes to $6 bucks each not bad cause it does get pricey like a $10 lunch.  I figured it&#39;s because of the quality of the food, they make it fresh for you, and your dinning experience sitting it their nice marbled tables and dark wood chairs and real utensil.  I would compare it like Panera Breads.

Finally you place your order (where the heck to you place this huge menu that you&#39;ve been carrying now?).  They give you a number for your order and you find a table and sit and wait (kind of like Pompeii restaurant).

The station where you get your fountain drinks and utensils is oddly positioned.  It doesn&#39;t really flow well in the room, especially with the huge lunch crowd, it sucks!  I wish it was more open not bunched up in a corner of the room.

And the seating arrangements, they have too many tables too close to each other in the main dinning area.  If you&#39;re lucky, sit in the semi private area on the far left side of the room or if it&#39;s nice outside, eat out in the patio during lunchtime.  Unless you don&#39;t mind joining another tables conversation and it doesn&#39;t get pretty loud so you&#39;ll be shouting at your companion whose sitting right next to you.  

Maybe they&#39;re better off setting up these 4 chaired tables together into community tables or get smaller tables or get rid of a few of them.  Give me some breathing room please!

As for the food, it&#39;s ok.  I&#39;ve tried their buffalo chicken salad, chopped salad, BBQ chicken pizza,  Margarita pizza, fries, soups, chili.  They are all pretty good, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come back for any special item on their menu.

They do have folks clean off your table pretty quick for you so that&#39;s a plus.

I would come here once in awhile when I have a coupon for lunch or I got out voted from my coworkers on where to eat.  

As for dinner, there&#39;s other places I&#39;d rather go but I bet there&#39;s plenty of room and it would be a much quieter experience when you dine in."

Lunchtime at Buona can be really crowded and loud.  But, there are lots of tables (all close together), so I&#39;ve never not been able to get a seat.

If you&#39;ve not been to a Buona, it is a similar style to other larger Burger joints, but has a wider selection.  Their burgers are pretty good, and I like burgers a lot.  But, they also have hot dogs, pizza, Italian Beef, salads, sausage and peppers - typical Chicago fare.

Price-wise, they are a little at the high end for a burger joint.  But, they just put an app up on the iStore that works like a restaurant punch card.  You scan a graphic when you pay, and it counts your meals.  After 10 (I think), you get one free."

I will often drive to one of the other establishments in the area for food due to the quality price and service.  I would expect at a much lower price point due to the quality of the food and speed of service.  On a few occasions i ordered dinner for a small party from this location and paid over the phone.  Upon arrival i was informed that they did not have the food i paid for in the store and requested i drive 20 minutes out of my way to pick it up.  When i told the manager i was unwilling to drive 20 minutes out of my way and would like them to exchange the beef meal i was going to pick up for one of sausages he treated me like i was being unreasonable.  After the experience I gave away the gift card to bouna rather than return.  After an office visit today I feel justified in giving away my gift card as the food is over priced and unremarkable.  The speed of the kitchen is slow and they will often make mistakes in your order.  The only plus for this buisness is its location.

I think the only reason the line is out the door at lunch time is the limited availability of local fast food in proportion to the office buildings surrounding it. 

Portions are small, prices are high. The amount of food in their Chicken Artichoke sandwich is laughable. I had to send mine back asking for the rest of it.  Their thin crust pizza isn&#39;t really that good, and they should warn idiots like me when a variety doesn&#39;t come with pizza sauce on it. Idiots like me are used to pizza with sauce on it. Their burgers are just okay, nothing spectacular at all.

Don&#39;t bother calling or faxing in your order, as it will sit there ignored like you will be, while the cashiers tend to the wait line instead. Your smart thinking by ordering ahead is wasted here, trust me.

One of the best casual restaurant concepts I have come across! It has gradually changed and refined it&#39;s process over the years, definitely on the level to compete with Portillo&#39;s, but has a wider variety of food items on the menu. 

Don&#39;t come here looking for healthy food alternatives, this place should serve as a once-in-a-while indulgence. Great Italian Beef, Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches, tasty Salads, individual custom Pizzas available in 5 minutes or less. I like the Beef and Giardinara Pizza the most. There is also great gelato if you have room and can take the calories. You can have a seat and relax after you order, and they will bring it right over when it&#39;s ready. 

As you come in to look at the menu, you can walk past the line and see food items being prepared while you consider your order. I like this upfront approach to showing customers what is going on in the kitchen. I happened to notice the Pizza Makers being very kind to the children and making conversation with them when I came in on Monday. There are also fresh sample versions on your way to the counter of some of the more popular items to consider. 

Monday when my girlfriend and I dined there for lunch, the manager happened to notice we were talking about the bread on my girlfriend&#39;s sandwich being a little on the rough side, and offered to remake it with a different bread immediately! Totally unexpected! I have never had a bad experience here, and the food always is unspeakably fantastic! The place seems to fill up during dinner time, and I can see why. Buonaaaa Beeeef!"

I also enjoy their personal pizza selections, their prosciutto and Alfredo is actually my favorite.  The service is acceptable, the cashiers are always very friendly but the wait staff cannot be bothered to manage a smile or engage their customers.  Most won&#39;t even look at you.  One gentlemen barely issued a grunt when I expressed my thanks for my order.  The managers, however,  are usually very nice and processional .  I agree with the other reviewers that the sides are over-priced for what&#39;s included. 
 The soups are actually pretty good but I can tell that they&#39;re loaded with salt and the fries aren&#39;t worth the calories, let alone the money.
   Now, on to the beef, hence the name.  I don&#39;t their beef is bad or good it&#39;s merely okay, I usually get cheese on it and peppers then it&#39;s actually pretty good ;).  In contrast, Portillos has the most amazing beef sandwich I&#39;ve already had.  A really good beef sandwich would be offended if someone overloaded it with cheese or peppers; like a good steak, you shouldn&#39;t need condoments (A1 Sauce).
Lastly, this particular location is wayyyy over crowded for the quality of food!  There&#39;s very rarely seating available and I&#39;ve not been able to call in an order on the occasions I&#39;ve tried; the phone just rings.

The individual pan pizza&#39;s are great too. Add some cheese fries and your good to go! 

One thing that gets me is their coupons they give out for purchases. They expire within a week. Bouna Beef may be good, but twice a week is pushing it."

Immediately, we were greeted by the friendly woman behind the counter. Very warm and courteous, and made us feel happy and welcome. When ordering our food, she even offered us free chicken noodle soup, which she promised was delicious, and boy, was she right! 

The portions for the soup are great, and the chicken noodle is filled with tons of noodles and chicken. Not salty at all, just perfect. 

For my meal, I had the chicken kabob sandwich, which is a skewer of chicken kabob on top of a pita with tomatoes and onions. Now, I&#39;ve had chicken kabob from countless restaurants and I have to say that the chicken kabob at Charkie&#39;s is one of the best I&#39;ve had. Extremely soft and tender, juicy, well-marinated and flavorful, and cooked perfectly with just a little char on the outside. And, I believe the price was only around $6.25. I wish I lived closer so I can have this sandwich more often! You need to try it! It&#39;s THAT good. 

Also, I&#39;m a little bit of a tzatziki snob, and know good tzatziki vs. the not-so-good and I was really happy with the tzatziki sauce at Charkie&#39;s. It&#39;s thick and has the perfect amount of garlic. It complimented the flavors of the Greek chicken perfectly. 

My friend ordered the skirt steak and although I didn&#39;t try it, it looked delicious and he thoroughly enjoyed every bite. 

Will be back soon to try additional menu items!"

Time of my visit: Linch

I have been to this place once before on a recommendation of a former co-worker.  I have decided to go for lunch there today.

I ordered chicken skewer plate dinner, which came with 2 chicken skewers, salad, pita and a side (I chose fries).  If you dine in, you&#39;d get a free soup, which was chicken noodle.

I consumed the soup first.  It was not anything special...  About average....  I should not complain as it was billed as &#34;complementary&#34;.  It did not take long for my food to come out.  I was a bit disappointed with the salad, it did not have much of a substance, iceberg lettuce, some onions and one slice of tomato.  It was subpar, I could not really finish it.  The fries were bland, typical pre-frozen, nothing special, average.  The chicken, even thought had some flavor to it, tasted a bit rubbery.  Cucumber source and pita were about the only two things that saved it.  Overall, I was slightly disappointed for $10 and change it was not worth it.

C-!  I might come back again and try something else at some point in a distant future."

While running errands one evening we found Charkies. Having no idea what type of food they served we figured we&#39;d stop in and check it out! It looked like a good place to get take out to go with our Redbox movies!

On our first visit I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp with Salad, Mashed Potatoes with Gravy, and Garlic Bread. The shrimp was cooked just right and the breading was light, though it was a bit greasy. The salad was a simple tossed with onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers. The mashed potatoes were pretty typical with brown gravy. The garlic bread was VERY greasy and had a bit too much garlic. That&#39;s a lot for me to say since I love garlic!

The boy ordered the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich and a side of Mozzarella Sticks. The sandwich is served open faced and is huge! The boy really liked his sandwich and even had enough to take for lunch the next day! The mozzarella sticks were regular and just ok.

Our second visit was a step up! I ordered the Meatloaf Dinner with Rice and Garlic Bread. The meatloaf was tender and juicy. The rice was flavorful which isn&#39;t always the case! And the garlic bread was much better! Just enough butter for flavor this time, though it could have used more garlic! 

The boy ordered the Gyro as a sandwich with Cheese Fries. It was huge! He got quite a bit on him as he actually attempted to eat it as a sandwich! It was funny to watch! He really like the cheesy fries too.

The funny thing about this visit was that there were about 50 people from a church group in the dining room when we came in to pick up our order. They were scrambling to get everything together for people. Maybe they work better under pressure since our food was a step up! I&#39;ll give em an extra star for both the food and the level of effort on this one! I hope the next time we stop in it will be this good again! We need a good and quick take out place!"

My mental notes always seem to get lost, I always forget this place. Earlier this week I was out running errands and at noon realized that I had not eaten anything yet. As my stomach was rumbling I drove past Charkies and all of a sudden my mental notes came back to me. I walked in and it smelled delicious in there. They offer many choices, so many that I couldn&#39;t decide what I wanted. I finally decided that I wasn&#39;t going to worry about calories and  went with the gyros plate. I ordered it with fries and got it to go. I waited about 5 minutes and my order was called. I grabbed my white paper bag and got into my car. The 5 minutes it takes to get from the restaurant to my house was pure torture! The smell coming out of the bag was amazing! 
I get home and unpack my meal and I was so surprised, pleasantly surprised. This gyro plate was no joke! An insane amount of meat, a pita, a generous amount of tzatziki sauce on the side, fresh cut slices of tomato and plenty of onions. Oh and can&#39;t forget my bag of fries. 
The meat was cooked perfectly, so full of flavor, the sauce was great, and the huge portion was great. I had enough to have some for dinner. 
I was extremely satisfied with my meal. I&#39;ve found that some places offer the gyro meat and it&#39;s hard and over cooked, not Charkies, their gyro was perfect! With this being only a 5 min drive from my house I can guarantee I will be back. 
If you choose to dine in they have plenty of seating and the employees were nice."

The food itself is great. If you get an entree you get a free soup (pro tip: figure out what day chicken &amp; wild rice is being served AND YOU GO ON THAT DAY FORSURE). I mainly get the mushroom burger whennever I go, and the burger is bigger than your average one.

A lot of people who works in the area comes to this place for lunch otherwise it&#39;s across Walgreens and residential, behind and other surroundings are manufacturing and industrial plants. So location gets no star. 
I&#39;ve had their gyro and burgers before and those are all good. But right now, I&#39;m on the Paleo diet where I only eat meats and veggies so I came here to get their kabob and veggies. The kabob plate cost about $10, it came with 2 skewers and I skipped everything that came with it-- bread, fries, other sides. I opted for the salad and veggies instead. The chicken was perfectly marinated, very tasty, juicy, and tender. I will most definitely order again. 

TIP:  if you dine in, you get free soup with your meal."

We also got a hot dog which was about as ordinary and forgettable as you can get, chicken fingers that were super thin and dry, and a gyro that I am told was good.

It was a bitter cold night and we were hungry. Time to find a quick bite at a reasonable price point with some quality behind the food. Charkies hit on all of these details. A couple of Glendale Heights Finest were ordering in front of us. A little chit chat ensued and I knew that I wanted to try their chicken. 

We had chicken kabobs with grilled onions and a pita bread and shared an order of French fries. Each meal comes with a complimentary bowl of soup. The meal was less than $6. Add in the fries, the free soup, a fountain drink for each of us and we were still less than $10 each. I spend more at other places for way less. 

And so we tried the veggie soup. This was more like a stew. It was thick and the vegetables were large chunks. This was especially perfect when I came across the potatoes in the soup. If I had eaten all of my soup, I would not have eaten my meal. The chicken was grilled and arrived juicy with perfectly saut√©ed onions on a warm pita bread. The fries were completely unnecessary, but that didn&#39;t stop us from eating a few. 

The restaurant is fairly large and was kept clean with busboys coming around regularly to clear things. 

Next time...gyros!"

It was lunch time and they seemed fairly busy, which I always take as a good sign. I came in a few minutes earlier, and the food was ready right away. Despite the crowd, there was no line when I went to go pay. 

I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings. Both were huge! Interestingly the burger was dressed &#34;upside-down.&#34; Mustard tomato, lettuce, pickles were all on the bottom bun. Only mayo on top bun. I wasn&#39;t loving the taste, so I flipped the patty and the dressings and found it to be ten times tastier.

Their top quality ingredients are what you would expect from a nice sit down restaurant. After reading all of the reviews here and seeing that its minutes from my home, I could not wait to give it a try.

The reviewers here are correct. This is about as good as fast food gets. I had the Philly Steak sandwich which was so huge that I could barely eat it all. And that is a problem I never have. The steak was tender and juicy, the cheese and grilled veggies were plentiful. The bread was fresh and tasty. The wife had a cheeseburger and that was good as well. We also had the onion rings and those were the best I have ever had. They were not greasy and were cooked to perfection and even had a crunch to them. The amount of rings in the order was huge.

I can&#39;t believe it took me so long to try this place. It is the best there is in the area of this type of place. It will be our new to-go  spot. The prices were a little high for the typical sandwich place but it was well worth it. Their menu has a lot of items and if your not in the mood for a sandwich they have plenty of other entries to choose from.

While we were waiting for our order we tried their complimentary cookies that were on the counter. Whoa! Were they good!"

Free Soup with any order when dining in only...great on a gloomy &amp; chilly day!!

Food:
Chicken on Pita (~$6): pickle is included with the chicken pita sandwich..the chicken was cooked well (not too dry or undercooked..)..tasted good with the pita bread

Turkey BLT with fries &amp; coleslaw  (~$8-10?): my friend ordered this and said it was good.. as you can see from my photos.. they give you A LOT!!.. unless you eat a lot.. you&#39;ll have leftovers for sure!

Service: I went at around 1:30PM with my friend for lunch one day and I felt kind of rushed when ordering so I was not a fan of that...

Costs: a little bit on the pricier end for the food that you are ordering, but I guess they give you a lot...

Atmosphere: laid back and casual atmosphere.. good to come here with co-workers, friends or a friend for a quick meal..

the food isn&#39;t to die for or anything, but if I was in the area and looking for something to eat.. I would stop by again.."

The reason for my 3 stars and not higher is I ordered their soup of the day, cream of chicken rice and it was terrible. No chicken or chicken flavor. Tons of rice and more watery tasting then cream. I don&#39;t understand how they can call that a chicken or a cream soup... so I will come here for the gyros only!!!"

However, I&#39;ve recently been trying to eat less meat. 
One star off because their salads are made with iceberg lettuce. :("

I like to give locally owned places like this more business, but I was very underwhelmed by the food and service here. The gyro meat was over-cooked and bland and the Tzaziki sauce was pasty. My daughter had the BBQ chicken and it tasted like it was made earlier in the day. The people waiting on us were not nice at all. We won&#39;t be returning here."

When you walk in you immediately notice TVs on the wall, newer seating and a very clean inside.  Upon walking in you&#39;ll see their menu board which contains a wide variety of items including Gyros, Club Sandwiches, Hot Dogs, Burgers, and even Pasta.

At Charkies I decided to try the hot dog, in fact I tried two variations of it. I got one regular hot dog and one char-dog. The regular hot dog came on a soft but plain non-poppy seed bun. The hot dog itself was well boiled and still had the skin visible over the tip. The condiments were all evenly applied with a nice amount of mustard, relish, onions, and a dash of celery salt. The pickle was cut a little too thick for my liking but wasn&#39;t too sour. The tomato slices were small and fit on the dog nicely. The skin had a nice snap when I bit into the dog. This was a pretty solid hot dog with my only complaints being the non-poppy seed bun and the thicker than preferable cut of pickle.

The char-dog was prepared much in the same way with the ends split and some noticable charring on the sausage itself. This tasted a bit better than the boiled dog. With both being the same price I&#39;d recommend it over the steamed variety.

I also got their french fries, these are a crinkle cut style of fry with a nice soft middle, not too crisp, not too much salt, and a nice soft potato inside. I liked the fries as well.

Overall I would recommend Charkies if you&#39;re in the area and looking to try a char-dog. I would definitely visit again."

I went with my mom and husband and we were all impressed. I had chicken that was stuffed with spinach rice and feta cheese with sides of veggies and Grecian potatoes. It was cooked perfectly and there was plenty for leftovers. My husband had a hot dog and fry combo which he liked. And mom had the blt which came with a heaping pile of fries. Again, plenty for leftovers!

There are a few reasons for five stars. First is the much talked about free soup. Yes it&#39;s free, but it is really really good! Mind you, it was a ninety degree day, so we weren&#39;t really in the mood for soup. But after I tried it, I forced it on my mom and husband. Hands down some of the best soup ever. Also the lady at the counter was really nice. I spent a Lot of time trying to figure out what I wanted. She patently suggested the chicken, and was very talkative and friendly. After we were done she asked how we like the food and we talked for a few minutes more. You can tell she takes pride. 

Good food and good people. So unfortunate that you can&#39;t find that everywhere."

I ordered the gyro platter with a rice pilaf, and my wife ordered an Italian Beef with fries. A complimentary bowl of cream of chicken and rice soup came with the order.

The soup was great! Only a few chicken chunks, but the soup itself was rich and made from a good chicken broth.

The gyro platter was pretty good; the shaved lamb was nicely seasoned and a bit crispy on the edges. The cucumber sauce in particular was fresh and flavorful. One of the fresh-cut tomatoes was a little less than ripe, but I actually didn&#39;t notice it. The grilled onions were good.

Italian sandwiches come very well dipped, so break out the napkins.  They were decent. The fries weren&#39;t anything to write home about, but by the time I tried them I was already very full.

I love the Gyro dinner platter! It is my favorite. I&#39;m anxious to try the chicken caesar pita sandwich. The complimentary soup is a fantastic feature!

It was here or Agostinos but figured the line was shorter here.   Glad we got there before noon because the line was out the door at 12:01.   

Anyway, for lunch split a gyro, a greek chicken dinner with roasted greek potatoes and each had soup.   The soup of the day was cream of chicken with rice - pretty standard greek family restaraunt style - a little thin, but good enough for the price (free).   The gyro was a good sandwich but the cucumber sauce left a bit to be desired - it was a bit thin.    Now the greek chicken was the star of the meal.  The chicken was done perfectly and the potatoes were the best rendition of them I&#39;ve ever had.   Definitely will repeat.  

Service was good - they helped me take my trays to the seat.  Prices were fair.   Maybe a tad on the high side, but not outrageous."

Has the look of a fast food joint, but offers much more than one would expect. I go to lunch here quite often, and my favorites over time have been consistently delicious--the Greek chicken and the chicken shishkabob sandwich.  The Greek chicken is a huge portion, usually enough to feed 2 people.  The skin is nicely seasoned and crispy,  the Greek potatoes are to die for and I&#39;ve recently started ordering garlic bread instead of a pita bc it&#39;s just that damn good.

Everyone I take here ends up loving the food, it&#39;s just so much better than our other local offerings and even when it seems like fast food, it&#39;s so much better than your typical greasy burger joint.  The atmosphere is nice, everything is clean, the owners and staff are very friendly, and hey, who can beat free soup with your meal?!  The chicken and rice is the best, so I&#39;ve learned my lesson in avoiding this place on Fridays during Lent (when the cream of chicken is usually served) ;-)

Italian Beef - meh. Honestly, Portillo&#39;s is better. And that ain&#39;t saying much.
Hot dog -- expensive -- the &#34;value meal&#34; is $5...

You&#39;re better off at Augustino&#39;s for those items. Actually, where Charkie&#39;s rules is in the the stuff you&#39;d usually NOT buy at a sandwich shop.

The Club sandwiches are Ginormous, with fries and slaw for under $7 - and they&#39;ll give you a nice bowl of soup with it. The split pea earlier this week was GREAT! The chicken kabob is also always great and a good deal.

But honestly, because this place is Greek-owned, you&#39;ve got to go with the Gyros platter (real good) or the stupidly big Greek Salad.

My only gripe is having to bus your own tables. This place uses real plates (heavy), real soup bowls (heavy) , and real silverware (really?). So you either have to sort your trash yourself when cleaning up, or be a lazy so-and-so (like me) and dump the whole thing in the bus bin. I&#39;d prefer that they bus the tables themselves -- or *shudder* switch to disposable everything -- biodegradable, of course!

TIP: If you ask for anchovies on your Greek Salad, double-check that you got them before carrying the massive plate of greens back to your table. They have a bad habit of doubting your sincerity when you say yes! to the stinky salty little fish..."

The portions are gigantic. The food is delish and fresh tasting. Not too salty, good seasoning, all around good. The greek potatoes were awesome, almost upstaging the gyros plate and steak sandwich. Yes, that&#39;s a lot of food, and yes...I enjoyed it.

The soup was surprisingly tasty for being free, and they&#39;re no stranger to giving out take-home containers for those of us who order a tad bit more than we should. I was stuffed for two days based on my one visit."

After eating at well over 50 places that serve gyros, Charkies is the best in my book. Their homemade sauce is what sets them apart. It is a perfect blend with a healthy amount of cucumber bits in it. 

I&#39;ve tried countless items off their menu and everything has been top notch. They have large portions that are priced right, fast and friendly service and there is a large amount of seating with a hand full of TVs. Also, they are super clean and hey, free bowl of soup!"

I chuckled inside when I first walked in because there is a sticker that reads &#34;People on Yelp Love Us.&#34;  My first thought was, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ll be the judge of that.&#34;  

You know what?  I do love Charkies.  The prices are reasonable and portions plenty.  Also, if you dine-in they offer you a complementary bowl of Chicken Noodle soup. Perfect for a chilly day like it was when I was there.  

The environment was inviting and clean.  Seriously, I was there for awhile and I can&#39;t recall anytime there wasn&#39;t someone cleaning.  Also, everyone I encountered at Charkies were friendly and nice.  

Now, if you notice I only gave them four of five stars.  That has to do with the fact that I can think o=f one improvement they can make . . . free wifi.  Yes, being the special kind of geek that I am I had my laptop with me and it would have been nice to surf the web while I ate.

First thing we came in around 7:00pm on a Saturday, fairly packed.  As we walked in we we were seated in a circular booth, nice and secluded.  

We looked at the menu and also considered the &#34;specials of the day&#34;. She ordered the Lobster Ravoli and she loved it.  And I ordered the Cavatelli Trio.  The waiter had various recommendations and mentioned that the vodka pasta was a homemade recipe and highly recommended it (it was great!) We also ordered the Classico Pizza and was stuffed of course we ended up bringing most of it home. 

The meals were fairly cheap ranging from $15-$30.  Very affordable, great service, and would come back."

Quick Fire is a fine example of an establishment with a wonderful concept, above average ambience,and some truly exquisite menu items. Where do they go wrong you may ask? A restaurant with all of these qualities must be a hit out of the ball park, right??? Well my fellow diners the problems lay within the execution of service, and lack of wine knowledge the servers possessed. 

Well let&#39;s start with the good. 

     Quick fire cafe has some phenomenal pizza, some of the best i&#39;ve ever had to be frank, lets just start there if you are going to this establishment and dont order a pizza you have reached a level of insanity known as uber insanity! In this critic&#39;s opinion Quick Fire&#39;s pizza is the perfect size for a personal meal, the sauce to cheese ratio is a 10/10 as well! They also have what in my opinion is a future award winning in house made vodka sauce. I would also highly recommend any pasta dish with vodka sauce as a solid second choice. The fried calamari appetizer was decent at best but for $9.99 wasn&#39;t a bad choice. The ambience is truly fantastic i would call it romantic classy/casual. Quick fire is mainly wood furnished with romantic lighting and even is stocked with a bar and gaming, the restaurant is aesthetically appealing without a doubt.

Now for the bad...

    Let&#39;s start with the service, the wait time in my opinion was above average, even when business is slow. For me this is a significant issue, my time is my money therefore it is valuable, and i recommend that any consumer has this philosophy. A long wait time is understandable and maybe even expected in a packed restaurant, but when you and 2 other tables make up all customers to be accounted for an unreliable wait time suggests either disorder of operations, lack of management, lack of value for the customers time/money or possibly all of the above! Now for me here was the deal breaker, The service staff had no knowledge of wine. The restaurant has the perfect atmosphere to have some pizza and pasta with friends after work or even for a quaint evening with a date, and any good italian knows you need a good glass of chianti to go along with all of the food, friends, lovers, conversation, and shenanigans occurring. I asked our waitress to recommend a wine to me and to my complete and utter shock and surprise she couldn&#39;t, ok well not every one is a wine connoisseur so i cant&#39; be upset about her honesty. I would rather be told honestly that she dosn&#39;t know than being served vinegar. So i asked her if they had a chianti (my go to wine)
and now to my disgust in a restaurant that serves italian cuisine the waitress had no idea what chianti was!!!!!!!!!!!!! When i finally spoke to someone who knew what chianti was and that they did indeed posses this mystical elixir when i finally received it i had to send it back, it tasted as if they had poured a bottle of vinegar into the bottle and passed it off as chianti! TOTAL DEAL BREAKER FOR THIS CRITIC! 

So in conclusion...

     I would say that Quick Fire Cafe is worth a visit. They have some exquisite menu items a fantastic ambience with a romantic classy/casual but over all fun vibe and gaming (video gambling) adds something to the establishment, but the lack of service unreliable wait time and complete lack of wine knowledge amongst the service staff brings this establishment down a lot, and can lead to a disappointing experience. The restaurant has a great concept that is poorly executed. In my opinion Quick Fire Cafe really could be great, but they get in the way of there own success."

I wanted to try this place dining in because I believe they have the potential for 4.5 or 5stars. I wish Yelp allowed half star reviews. Food is always different when you do take out. I tried factoring that in when I did this review. 

The server that helped us recommended that first timers should try what they are famous for which is their vodka sauce. He was very friendly. I ordered the meat ball and vodka sauce pizza and the rotollo vodka pasta. On Thursdays if you order 2 entrees you get a free appetizer tags $9 or less.  I order the fried  zucchini. It was really really good. The pizza was good as well. I wouldn&#39;t order the rotollo again, but it&#39;s because it has a strong spinach taste. It was still good though. Definitely would eat here again. My family also enjoyed. 

Next time I want to try Margherita mozzarella pizza. That&#39;s my favorite style of pizza."

It was a Tuesday night, and we were the only customers in the restaurant. Which is always a little eerie, but I digress. 

The food was good, definitely the strongest aspect of the establishment. However, the service was slow. Mind you, there was no one else in the restaurant. Baffling, right? One multiple occasions I had to wait for my water to be refilled. 

We had the calamari as an appetizer, and I had the tri something pasta. Sorry, can&#39;t remember the title, sue me. It&#39;s cooked in vodka sauce, which is the chef&#39;s specialty. If was good, but nothing to write home about. 

Honestly, I didn&#39;t feel like this place had anything special or significant to it. Again, the food was decent, but the environment was kinda bland, especially since it was lacking people."

The spot this one is in has had its fair share of ill luck over the years- been four or five different things in my two decades alive, but I&#39;m hoping this one sticks around. 
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a meal this good for this price. The bread and minestrone were excellent, but the entrees are where it shined. I had a build your own pasta (gnocchi with arriabate sauce, shrimp, and calimari) and a dining companion had the lobster ravioli. Both were spectacular, and the portions were very large, all for a relatively inexpensive price. My meal came up about ten or fifteen dollars under what I would have expected. 
The atmosphere is nice, with a sleek modernist decor (a holdover from the previous restaurant in the space, whose name escapes me). Our server, Nikki, was friendly and attentive, and there was little wait for the food. Could not recommend highly enough."

For the location, you would be surprised from the interior and the quality of food that this is located in Stratford Mall in Bloomingdale. 

I love my deep dish pizza but I also love neopolitan-style pizza. At QFC, the pizza is done right where the crust has a nice chew and a slight char from the wood fire. Normally, neopolitan pizza costs more so it was a relief to see the prices from $11-14 per pizza. At these prices, you can order a few and share with a group.

We ordered the calamari, two pasta dishes, and three pizzas. Each one of us had to get our food packed because we couldn&#39;t finish our meals. Even the kids size order was close to an adult size which was surprising. Nowadays, it&#39;s not often that restaurants are providing larger sized food portions at reasonable prices. Everyone enjoyed their food and service was great as well. 

I&#39;ll be back for their pizza and to try their Boss is the Sauce winning vodka sauce next time."

I saw that this place opened relatively recently and none of the current reviews could help me nail down what kind of a place it was, so I decided to just give it a try on a Friday night.

There was no wait time when we arrived, and the restaurant was roughly half-empty. This could be because it&#39;s in a particularly hidden part of Stratford Square, but on the other hand Red Robin&#39;s doing just fine, so who knows?

It took over five minutes for a server to see us once we were settled in, and this pattern continued through the meal. Just to simplify things we ordered all at once; calamari, risotto porcini, and a wood-fired prosciutto pizza (claim: best in the northwest suburbs!)

The calamari was fine, but the battered coating was thick enough to remind me of fried chicken. This is not a good association, but on the other hand it tasted great, so I decided it was a good appetizer.

Risotto made right takes a while, so 20 minutes after finishing the calamari we got the rest of the meal. To their credit they absolutely nailed the texture on the risotto, but even with the help of porcini mushrooms I thought the flavor was fairly one-dimensional--earthy. It was also on the higher end of salty. I didn&#39;t catch any Parmagiano Reggiano flavor, either.

The pizza may well be the best in the northwest suburbs, but it doesn&#39;t crack the top 3 in the west suburbs. The dough was well cooked but basic. Likewise, the cheese was pretty second-tier, but it had a ton of arugula on it (good!). I was a fan of the prosciutto.

With average food the service needs to be on point, and it wasn&#39;t. Our water glasses weren&#39;t topped up, my Diet Pepsi was completely forgotten and the check was dropped off with the expectation that I needed to go to the bar to pay it (I didn&#39;t need to, but it at least sped up the leaving process.) The periodic check-in that should&#39;ve caught any of these minor issues (how&#39;s your food? is there anything else you need? can I refill your glasses?) never happened.

The total bill at the end was a little more than $40 for the three of us. I&#39;d like to see some improvements made before I come back."

I have to say the location looked great. I can see it being a romantic dinner slot, even though it&#39;s located in the mall. I was going to order a salad but I found the wood fire grilled pizza only takes 10 minutes. The pizza wasn&#39;t that good. The sauce didn&#39;t stand out and there wasn&#39;t a lot of it. There was, though, A LOT of cheese. I mean it was great cheese pull, but the flavor wasn&#39;t there. The restaurant was also empty, so I felt the waiter could have paid more attention to our table."

At my request our waitress brought out a sample of the vodka sauce so I could see what all the hype was about before ordering. It was amazing, so I opted for the stuffed shells which were delicious. My husband had the veggie pizza which he liked as well. My dish came with soup or salad; I chose the minestrone which was unbelievably fresh and flavorful. 

Our waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive which always helps enhance the dining experience. 

Overall, I love this place. Even the prices are fairly reasonable for what you get. I was a bit shocked it wasn&#39;t busier on a Saturday afternoon. Maybe the location is a hindrance.

My family held a baby shower for my little sister here on sunday, the 18th. I was very surprised as soon as I walked in by the beautiful construction of this place. Where we held the shower was gorgeous, wooden beams holding the ceiling and a beautiful Sun window (i think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called).  Ok enough about the actually building....... 

So naturally after I said hello to my family members I went to the bar for a drink. I was greeted by a very welcoming and happy gentlemen that seemed eager to make me whatever drink I wanted. We talked a little and then I asked if he knew where the owner was.... He said well I am the owner. Pleasantly surprised to see the owner tending bar we talked a little more and realized we had some mutual friends. I should say I&#39;ve been in the rest. Industry for 11+ years. He was so pleasant and welcoming it was contagious.  Ok now to the party and food....... 

The menu we were served was fantastic with many choices to choose from. I naturally ordered the meatball pasta with vodka sauce with the intentions of sharing my pregnant sister&#39;s pizza. Lets just say she only allowed me to have one piece while she proceeded to eat a fourth of mine. 

The service was good but the owner , food and beautiful building were the highlights. As we were leaving the chef/owner walked most of us out and thanked us for choosing his place for our party.

This will not be the last time I come here to eat. I can&#39;t wait to bring my boyfriend and friends here for a nice night. Thank you Quick Fire for the experience and for making my little sister&#39;s shower one to remember!!!!"

The food was top notch, the atmosphere was friendly, and the owner/chef Nunzio went out of his way to accommodate our party. 

We hosted a baby shower here on Sunday. The area that was reserved for parties was perfect for a mid-size party(30-40) people. Everybody who attended loved the food and the atmosphere. There was a group of us males who really weren&#39;t a part of the baby shower, but were there to help set up, carry gifts, etc. During the baby shower we got to sit at the bar and watch the Bears game. Very accommodating, Chef Nunzio himself sat behind the bar and made sure we were adequately lubed up for our sports ball watching.

Quick Fire said that they are new to hosting parties, but there weren&#39;t any major issues that would be worth writing about. I think they did well and I would recommend Quick Fire for events like this. Chef Nunzio worked with my wife on creating the perfect menu for the afternoon at a reasonable price. I read another review that said this place was &#34;basically a step down from the Olive Garden&#34;. Ignoring the fact that THAT person eats at Olive Garden so probably shouldn&#39;t be taken as a reliable source for food reviews, I&#39;d just like to say that Quick Fire is not garbage Italian food created solely to appease the mass public who don&#39;t understand taste palettes, but has fresh food created by an award winning chef. If Quick Fire were located at let&#39;s say, anywhere near the Woodfield Mall instead of Stratford, you&#39;d probably have to RSVP days in advance to get a table. It&#39;s THAT good. 

Find out for yourself. Seek it out, you will be greatly rewarded. Awkward location aside, this place is great."

That was the echo.  Only two other tables were sat in the entire time we were there.  I know this place took over the former space of an Asian restaurant along with the furnishings so that accounts for how it looks like it doesn&#39;t know what it wants to be.  I didn&#39;t care for having views of the ugly stuff no matter where you sat...bus stations...back of bar...kitchen...casino stuff...  Just...eh.  Wrong vibe.  

The food was unremarkable. It&#39;s only been a few days and I can&#39;t even remember what I had.  Greasy fries and.....and.... gah!  Can&#39;t remember.  There you have it.

I understand it&#39;s busier at night witch karaoke and occasional performers.  Maybe that&#39;d help...it being dark.  And occupied."

I had been wanting to try it for some time.

 We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer, which was very good, not the best I ever had, but certainly good enough and at $9.99 it was a fair price.

 My children ordered kids Mac-N-Cheese and Chicken Tenders. I can tell you that I have never seen such large portions on a kids menu before. The portion size was not to make up for lack of quality either, the food was genuinely good. 

My ordered cheese tortellini with peas and prosciutto in an alfredo sauce, and while I didn&#39;t try her food, she would not stop talking about how good she thought it was, (to be clear, my wife is Italian, Calabrese to be exact so she can be a little picky). I ordered one of their signature Wood Fired Pizzas, the Picante. This pizza has chunks of italian sausage, with hot giardeneira and mozzarella cheese. It was amazing. 

After we were finished eating as much as we could, our waitress informed us that the Nunzio wanted to offer my kids some complimentary ice cream. Which I thought was a very nice touch. Nunzio also personally brought over a sample of the house made Vodka Sauce after I asked to try it. I am not a Vodka sauce fan, but it was shockingly good. 

The only thing keeping this review from receiving 5 stars is our service was a little slow considering that there were only a few other tables with customers. With that being said, my wife and I both agreed that we would be going back there, and that their Half Priced Pizza Tuesdays is a deal way too good to pass up."

Nice atmosphere but they are just cheap, and there are ways to cut corners to save money that doesn&#39;t make you look cheap.  Couple of details:


1.  The bread that we were given was a small quarter of Italian bread.  About the size of a hamburger bun.  For the whole table.  There were three in our party.  Tasted good tho, the little sliver I had.

2. We asked for Parmesan cheese.  Server brought two half filled plastic cups of the canned shakey stuff.  First of all at least give everyone at the table their ration, geez.  Second of all it doesn&#39;t take much to upgrade the presentation of something like that.  Like in pizza restaurants have those shakey jars It was just tacky.

3.  Had the gnocchi with sausage (build your own).  Gnocchi was undoubtedly from frozen.  It was ok.  The sausage is cut into tiny diced cubes and it is just weird especially in texture.  

The vodka sauce is definitely the best thing and I unfortunately didn&#39;t get it for my entree.  But my husband loved his rolloto al vodka so I bumped it to three stars.   

Also, after we boxed our leftovers, we waited 15 minutes for the check.  Raise your standards guys if you want repeat business."

Our guests were surprised with the variety of dishes they were offered &amp; the superb quality of the food. We were all sharing &#34;bites&#34; off each other&#39;s plates...the true Italian way of making a meal a celebration! The portions were most generous, so our guests were thrilled to take home their leftovers!  You need only 1 taste to know why Nunzio&#39;s Vodka Sauce, served with a choice of meatballs, Italian sausage or chicken, won The FoodNet Challenge! The Margarita Pizza was excellent as well.

Our food was not far behind which made it clear they forgot to put the pizza order in.  Then 15 minutes after dropping the check our waitress still hadn&#39;t picked it up so I had to seek someone out to pay for our meal.

It feels a bit awkward in there, like it wants to be a big great Italian restaurant, but it was empty.  We were the only ones there.  And the furniture doesn&#39;t reflect that upscale feel.  I understand it&#39;s hard to invest everything in a place, especially given that when my boyfriend and I are the only ones there at lunch time on a Saturday, but it just had a weird cheap feeling to it.

Our server was very nice and attentive.  We ordered a pizza to share and french fries.  Both items were good for lunch that day, but really nothing we needed to come back for and wasn&#39;t the kind of pizza I want to eat as leftovers.

I will say the prices were good, service was good.  It looks like they have karaoke some nights if that&#39;s your thing.  There are a lot of other menu options so if someone asked if I wanted to come here I wouldn&#39;t say no, I just wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come back.

Oh and also was bummed that the outdoor seating wasn&#39;t open even though it was a nice day out.  Not sure if that&#39;s just a smoker&#39;s den or actual seating."

I do have a suggestion though. Perhaps putting some kind of blinds or cool shade on the window to the mall would be helpful to the people seated close by. I just noticed how many kids banged on the glass or tried peeking in by our table.

We have been here two previous times, and well the food is pretty good, the service seems to be going the other direction. We were seated by a lady that was also working the bar, she said the would bring over two sets of silverware and crayons for my daughter, after asking about 4 times I finally grabed some silverware from another table and asked a third person for some crayons. 
I ordered a beer which I accidentally spilled. My wife was able to get some napkins after trying to find someone for a few minutes. What was a surprise to me is noone offered to help us clean up our spill. We were given napkins and everyone walked away. The worst part is after we cleaned the table the napkins sat in the table drenched in beer during our whole dinner.
The food came and I had vodka sauce and cavatali, sauce is always really good, but pasta was over cooked and mushy. My daughter had Mac and cheese which looked very good to me, but it was to fancy for my 5 year old. We opted for chicken fingers which she did enjoy. 
I was hoping after being open for a little over a year they would have there service top notch but it does not appear that will ever happen. I am disappointed as the vodka sauce is some of the best I have had, but we will not be going back due the the below average service.

quick-fire-cafe-bloomingdale,Andrew J.,HhBaavr8N_1DYclbr3xpvQ,"Roselle, IL",0,1,1,64,3,xCJMx1U1kdjjWAqQcCDbYQ,3.0,2015-01-14,"Quick Fire Cafe is a restaurant with tasty food, reasonable prices, and room for improvement. I&#39;d be happy to go back for the dish that I had, but I was not wowed by my experience for a number of reasons that I will elucidate here.

Let me start with a big positive: the food really was lovely and reasonably priced. For about $8, I had the Penne Vodka. The sauce was flavorful, the pasta was well cooked, and the portion size was nice. My wife also tried a make-your-own pizza which was fresh and tasty with a great crust. Both are worth a return visit.

With that said, I&#39;m not in a rush. Here&#39;s why:

First, there&#39;s the speed of service. For us, it was really, really slow. We were one of three tables in the place, we didn&#39;t order appetizers, and our food took over 20 minutes. I know you can&#39;t rush pizza necessarily, but in a place called &#34;quick fire&#34; I&#39;m expecting a little more. If a full pizza takes too long, why not specialize in pizzettes? Lots of trendy new places serve pizzettes, which are delicious, light, and faster than a full pizza.

Secondly, there&#39;s video games. We were seated next to a curtained off area for &#34;21 and over&#34; video game gambling. Do you like hearing &#34;ding!ding!ding!&#34; through your whole meal? We did. 

Let me go a step farther: I expect video game gambling at townie bars, not at a mall destination. I get that it&#39;s a source of revenue, but it&#39;s also tacky and makes more discerning customers say &#34;no thanks, I&#39;ll just go to Sbarros or Auntie Anne&#39;s.&#34; I&#39;ve walked by Quickfire on three separate occasions for that reason alone; I wonder how many other people have done the same? No offense to video game gamblers out there, but there&#39;s an impression about what this means in the way of clientele, and it&#39;s not super positive. If I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll feel comfortable with the other clientele, why would I visit your location?

Also, unfortunately, we had just started eating when some restaurant employees decided to unbox some new speakers and try them out while the main speakers were still playing music- and then test the volume levels to see how good they were. It was kind of annoying. I get that we were one of only a handful of tables in the restaurant and that you wouldn&#39;t want to do something like this with a full house. But how about waiting until the restaurant was closed? When there are only three tables in a large, mostly vacant restaurant, I&#39;m wondering why you&#39;d want to annoy the few people giving your place a chance? 

I also noticed another little thing that is a pet peeve of mine: cone cups on liquor bottles at the bar. Before a restaurant closes at night, one of the things you do at the bar is clean and cover the bottle tops at your bar. Sometimes places use plastic. Other times they use cone cups. This place uses cone cups. I only know because they were sitting on all of the bottles when we walked in, while we ordered and ate, and after we left. Dear Quick Fire, it takes 30 seconds to take those off. When they remain on, it&#39;s a visual cue that either a) your restaurant is closed or b) you don&#39;t care about how you present yourselves. Neither one is good for business- as most servers, bartenders (or former restaurant workers like me) can tell you. 

One final note, QFK- and this didn&#39;t influence our meal experience so much- but I&#39;m wondering how much you really want things to work based on your decor? You guys have a hermit crab thing going on- that&#39;s where a new store in the mall moves into a store&#39;s old shell and does nothing but change the sign and a few things inside (see the Stratford toy store that clearly was a Disney Store at one point). The place doesn&#39;t scream &#34;new Italian.&#34; It screams &#34;former mexican/Asian.&#34; The decor is going in all sorts of directions, none of which give you any identity. The place isn&#39;t terrible, but it&#39;s obvious that for as much money as you may have put into Quick Fire, the concept needs more love because it&#39;s riding the coattails of other places that look like they had more money to invest. 

So our service was fine and we had a manager drop by and say hi and thank us for being there, but the place was alienating in other ways that made me feel on the fence about recommending this place. It&#39;s nice to pay lip service and ask if everything is great, but what do you say after the person asking you has just been testing speakers that have the whole table rolling their eyes? I&#39;m not going to sit there and say &#34;well the meal is fine but you were really annoying us just then.&#34; No. That would be uncomfortable. I&#39;m going to leave and write this review. 

It&#39;s kind of like a bad date. It&#39;s easier to get it over with and skip the next visit. In this case though, maybe it&#39;s worth one more date for that food. 

Maybe."

The owner of QFC came to our table to introduce himself and his restaurant.  We picked the fried calamari for an app...it was very very good...fresh and lightly battered...not greasy at all.

I had a the Greek Pizza without the chicken...it was excellent.  The dough was perfect, the crust was nice and bubbled.  My son had the Penne with Alfredo and ground beef...he loved it.  We took leftovers home and he ate the pizza and the penne for dinner later.  

I think it would have been good for the pasta to have maybe a garlic roll to sop up the sauce...but other than that it was very good.

I wish that there was some outside signage as we walked around the mall for half an hour before finding it.  The restaurant is located where the old Carlos Murphys Mexican restaurant was on the West side of the mall across from the old Houlihans.  Better signage would definitely bring in more people."

The food is delicious and the portions are extremely generous.  However, the service is terrible.  Our server did their best, but they had no support whatsoever for a group as large as ours.  I called 4 times to make changes to my reservation and each time they told me they didn&#39;t have a reservation for me so they were clearly not staffed for our group to come in.  No host, no assistance for the server.  The food took forever and we had to keep asking for more drinks, more bread, the children were so hungry.  Waited 1.5 hours for our food.  The poor server had to carry 3 plates at a time and make multiple trips to get our food out.  At least the kitchen staff could have helped with that.  Even though the food is awesome, we won&#39;t be coming back, based solely on the lack of service."

The owner greeted us at our table and you can tell he is passionate about what he does. The food is incredible. The vodka sauce is the best I have ever had.

We were awkwardly greeted at the front. I think the server was surprised to see anyone at that time of day. 

Anyhow.. She got a blue moon, which was served in a bottle. I thought that was strange. I got a jack and coke, it was mixed well. 

We ordered a pizza margherita and also the &#34;create your own&#34; penne pasta with chicken and vodka sauce. The pizza was average, but I&#39;m definitely a pizza snob, so I&#39;m pretty critical. But... Hooooooly pasta. I haven&#39;t ever had vodka sauce this good!! Good quality chicken in the dish as well, which made it more filling, although the portion was too much for the two of us to finish. We could have done with just one dish instead of two. 

I will definitely be back again for anything with the vodka sauce on it. Yummmmm!!!!!"

The service was actually terrible. The waiter asked what we order over 8 times. Never was asked if we needed new drinks- we had to ask for our own drinks to be refilled. Never was offered new plates for the food we shared we had to use the small bread plates to eat off of. Messed up our order over 5 times. Never once apologized. The manager knew what was going on and never came over to apologize. Charged us for food we never bought. It took over 4 people to try to work on the computers to print out a receipt and put our order in. At the end we asked for espresso and he forgot that again too. Will never come back here again. I will be sticking to Pasta Mia from now on. Worst experience I have ever had. It wasn&#39;t even crowded so this owner should be doing everything he can to make the customers who actually do come in want to come back.

I wanted so badly to like this place.   Nice decor, private booths, quality food options at affordable prices was a recipe for my next favorite restaurant.  However,  this place will not make it far under its current management.  The waiter made an error on my order, when asked to make the correction the manager insisted on charging me for half of the incorrect order.  She later dropped the charge after I refused to pay for their error, but the fact that she even tried was disappointing.

2nd time there we were greeted by the owner, Nunzio, who&#39;s a really nice guy. The decor, to me, makes it feel like a very, very nice place that&#39;s way above a &#34;mall restaurant&#34;. First time we went we were scared that it might be expensive but the prices are far more than reasonable, especially for the quality, which brings me to the main point.

The food! My wife and I have been to quite a few really nice Italian restaurants in Chicago and elsewhere and I&#39;d say the food at Quick Fire is just as good, if not better. Highly recommend the Apple, Pican and Chicken salad for appetizer (it&#39;s BIG so could easily be split between 2 or 3) and my wife, who is a bit of a aracini fanatic, swears that their aracini is 10x better than any she&#39;s ever had. Their vodka sauce is award winning and it&#39;s obvious why, it&#39;s incredibly good. 

Sounds like other people have had issues with the service, but both times we&#39;ve been there our waitress was extremely nice we had no issues. Either way, when it comes to restaurants, the wait staff is interchangable and can always be hit or miss, but what&#39;s most important is the food.

Overall I feel this place is very under-rated, probably because it&#39;s in the corner of a mall, but for the quality of the food and great prices, it&#39;s a fantastic place to go. Quickly becoming one of our favorites."

We ordered ravioli with pesto. The sauce was ok but the ravioli was undercooked. The pizza is pretty decent and its nice to be able to mix and match the sauces and toppings.

Other than that, there is nothing to talk about. Just a typical mall restaurant that was dead on a saturday night. There is a full bar with a television that people can watch games on. IMHO..if you&#39;re looking to watch games with a few friends then its actually a decent place. The owner is very friendly and the drinks are reasonable. There is also a new arcade/pool/bowling place in the mall to go to.

The mall itself is in dire straits with very few visitors and their main anchors - JC Penney and now Macy&#39;s leaving."

My wife and I went there and were unaware that its apparently ok for your server to flirt and eat at the bar and disregard his tables in the dining room.

We did get stuck right in front of the video gaming area which was not pleasant.  Quick Fire...I would relocate the video gambling area to the lower level with partial closure.  The bright &#34;cheezy&#34; lights shining in one&#39;s face while you are trying to enjoy a nice meal was not the greatest.  
One other issue I had which was not the fault of Quick Fire was a few families came with several kids per family.   They were all seated up stairs.  The parents must have totally enjoyed their dining experience because their kids were running around the restaurant and annoying other tables.  They were out of control. One table looked at the kids and said &#34;excuse me&#34;  The kids were hanging over the wall from upstairs and annoying the table below on the 1st floor.  Kids were brats!!   I think moving forward...the restaurant should say something to the parents about settling their kids down.  It is not a chucky cheese or McDonalds.    If you were @ Quick Fire  on 2/27 around 6:30 p.m. and sitting upstairs...I am talking about your kids! Think about other people in the restaurant next time and their dining experience.   Your family  would have been more suited for the food court in the mall.

All and all a very nice place and would go back."

Not heavy, not too much garlic, not overly creamy.  My husband had the vodka sauce and I liked it better than Grandma&#39;s!

We were sitting down for nearly 10 minutes without anyone greeting us. 2 Individuals past by us (1 waitress and 1 waiter) both made eye contact with me but did not greet us. I overheard ppl from the party laughing at us because we were just sitting there all awkward waiting for someone to come by. The workers were entertain the group of 7. It did look like maybe the group were friend of the waiter. I do believe there was a manager whom was entertain the group as well. It was a very awkward, weird, bad experience. I can here everyone talking because there wasn&#39;t any music or anything and I know some of the people were drunk because they were loud and obnoxious.

I will try this place again when go to mall and choose different sauce. No salad with pasta and no salad for one person (e.g. green or small dinner salad) on menu.

good- the vodka sauce, of course, the house salad, and the panna cotta.
not so good-the calamari was the smallest portion i&#39;ve ever seen. it was tasteless and rubbery. for nine dollars????
also not so good- my shells stuffed with cheese were way too salty. also tasteless
                                - the meatballs, which the waitress forgot, even though i mentioned
twice that i wanted a side order, were hard and tasteless.

Due to salt restrictions this the only Chinese dish I enjoy eating.

 The C.L.M was amazing. The shrimp were fresh and plump,the pork was tender and as well as the beef.
The noodles were stringy and super yummy.
The dinner size take out portion came in an extra large box.
I got two large meals out of it.

My wife is a Mongolian Beef lover. She said it was better than Heng Wings.  The take out portion was huge.

The BBQ pork was absolutely delicious. The pork was moist and the sauce had a soothing sweet note. Very well done. Again the portion was plentiful.

The egg rolls were average and just ok.
They were free with our order.
The order was delivered in less than 40 minutes.

With delivery and tax, the meal cost $35.
Great meal and a great value.
About $10 cheaper than Heng Wings .

I wanted to try the Lemon Chicken, which not every chinese restaurant offers. I liked it but I think Orange Chicken and Sweet and Sour is still my preferred choice. I got the crab rangoon and chicken fried rice. If you&#39;re not familiar with ordering chinese... the small fried rice is more than enough for one person. The rangoon is 6 pieces. 

If you spend over 20 dollars here you get an order (2) of egg rolls, they&#39;re huge and really tasty. Order also cokes with side of free white rice and fortune cookies.

First things first, their prices are great. They have some of the cheapest lunch specials around and you get a boatload of food for said prices. The lunch prices hold true every day except Monday (they are closed Mondays) from 1130am to 230pm. My lunch specials were $6.35 each and they come with a can of pop &amp; egg roll, woohoo but most on the menu are $6.15 each.

Sesame Chicken -  AMAZING! Honestly some of the best I&#39;ve ever had but be warned it&#39;s quite different than the usual Sesame Chicken. The sauce is soooo sweet and sticky. The chicken is really fresh and deep fried with just the right crisp on the outside.
Orange Chicken - Not spicy at all despite the menu warning. I liked the dish a lot but def preferred the sesame chicken
Fried Rice - Yum, delicious, really good
Egg Roll - Thank goodness it had no shrimp in it (I&#39;m allergic) but was filled with beef. Yummy eggroll that was deep fried to perfection.

I think this is my new favorite spot for Chinese food! It doesn&#39;t hurt that the lady working is so cute &amp; sweet. It&#39;s a hidden spot on the corner of a strip mall off of Northwest Highway (address says Quentin but it&#39;s actually NW Hwy facing).

I&#39;ve had the General Tso&#39;s chicken, the Sesame Chicken, the fried rice and the egg rolls. The chicken dishes and fried rice I&#39;d rate as better than Palatine&#39;s other options. Egg roll tasted a touch funky to us, though. Wouldn&#39;t recommend that one. 

Need a Chinese fix for take-out...it&#39;s actually a great option."

We also had the advertised lo mein and fried rice with vegetables and the only thing edible was the fried rice. I just threw away $40 worth of food in the can. The service was great but you can&#39;t get full on service alone.

My wife often gets the egg drop soup which is really good.  The last time she got the sweet and sour pork which is prepared with the meat in a separate container from the sauce so the breading doesn&#39;t get soggy.  Nice touch.  My favorites are the Moo Shu Pork or Beef and the Orange Beef.  We&#39;re really liked everything we&#39;ve had.  As an added bonus they give you 2 egg rolls for free if your order is over $15 after 4:00pm.  Also the prices are quite reasonable considering the size of the portions.  We always get two meals out of their dishes.

Everyone that posted on here said it was the best Chinese they&#39;ve had or the best around. Has anyone really had good Chinese before? were you all drunk? It was absolutely horrible. I got the Mongolian beef lunch special with an order of crab ragoon. The only thing that was good was the crab ragoon. The egg roll was disgusting. My sister ordered food as well and found hair in her food. short lil&#34;chinese persons hair. totally grossed out. I do not recommend this what so ever.

The food is outstanding, the portions generous, the pricing competitive, and the service fast and super friendly - a perfect combination we found at the end of a long week!  Our orders of beef and broccoli, lemon chicken, General Tsos chicken, and chicken fried rice all were fantastic.  We&#39;ve tried other local places in Palatine.  Tin Seng definitely wins our vote as the best.  It didn&#39;t hurt that our order included a couple of delicious egg rolls free of charge.

I found the reviews here pretty good so I decided to try it out for myself and I&#39;ll have to agree with them - pretty good for a little Chinese take out restaurant! The place is tucked in the corner of a little strip mall. The place is your typical call and order to pick up restaurant. Nothing fancy, but the wife and husband are super talkative and friendly. 

The husband cooks it right after you order your meal so the food always comes out steaming hot. I tried the fried rice and it actually tasted and looked like fried rice unlike some other places. It wasn&#39;t dry and none of the yellow rice crap that some cheap places serve you. The rainbow lo mein is pretty good too. They use thin egg noodles versus the fat thick noodles served at random Asian buffets. The lunch specials are always a good deal too, it comes with fried rice, eggroll and a drink. Pretty awesome for less then 5 bucks in my opinion. 

Otherwise, the Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli wasn&#39;t anything out of this world wow, butt then again, you are only paying 5 bucks for the lunch special and for that price  and serving size received it was pretty awesome."

Tin Seng is a gem of a hole in the wall, right on the corner of Quentin and 14.  After placing our order by phone I drove from Fox River Grove and was warmly greeted by Samantha, who was impressed I drove past three other Chinese restaurants that she threw in a free egg roll, which was delicious. 

We ordered garlic chicken lo mein and the thin noodles were perfect, just on the soft side of al dente, with yummy and super fresh veggies and chicken. We also had the cashew chicken which was rich and just spicy enough. 

I judge all Chinese restaurants on their pot stickers, and Tin Seng has the best ones I&#39;ve had in decades. Definitely handmade, crispy on the outside and moist and gingery on the inside. I&#39;m in heaven. 

Samantha, don&#39;t worry about how far the drive is - we will most definitely be back!"

My family has followed Tin Seng every time they&#39;ve moved, no matter how inconvenient.  40 minute trip to Barrington and back?  Worth it.  Though the current location is definitely more preferred...

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been disappointed by anything here.  I&#39;ve always been a fan of the General Tso&#39;s chicken, and lately I&#39;ve really been a fan of the twice cooked pork.  I love the veggie fried rice too.  It&#39;s great for breakfast the next day, but there never seems to be any left...  Most important:  Get the crab rangoons.  They&#39;re the biggest crab rangoons I&#39;ve ever seen, and they&#39;re also the best I&#39;ve ever had.  You will not be disappointed.  Unless you&#39;re on a diet, because these will kill your diet.  Because you will eat them all.  (and because, come on, it&#39;s deep fried cream cheese)  But you know, you probably won&#39;t care all that much because they&#39;re just that good.

Sometimes, there&#39;s a table and chairs inside where you could hypothetically eat, but generally it&#39;s best to do carry out or delivery.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m even in the delivery range so take-out for me!  The food is usually done on time, though sometimes maybe 5 minutes late if they&#39;re busy.  Never long enough to be a problem, though.  And remember, crab rangoons."

First off a warning to potential Costco Chicago Prime Giftcard users. You will not be able to take advantage of any specials or daily happy hour offerings if you choose use your gift cards.

I had 2 $50 gift cards that my wife purchased to celebrate our anniversary. We arrived during happy hour and I had my giftcards on the table (easily seen). We were advised that all appetizers were 1/2 off from 3pm to 7pm. We ordered 3 appetizers a few cocktails and full price main entrees. Our total bill with tax came to 131.60

When it came time to pay our bill, I was advised that the wait staff were told not to honor the gift cards in conjunction with the happy hour offerings. I told them I have used Giftcards from many restaurants over the last 20 years, including cards purchased from Costco, and I was never denied any specials or happy hour offerings as Gift Cards are tendered as &#34;cash cards&#34; and are to be used in place of cash for the specified amount on the gift card, in which case was $100 ($50 x 2).

After speaking with the GM Ari (and the owner George 2 days later) my requests to use the GC in addition to the Happy Hour specials was denied. The already applied happy hour discount was added back to my check and I paid full price for our dinner. 

There are too many other steakhouses/restaurants in the area that accept gift cards, credit cards etc. and still allow specials such as happy hour.

Terrible customer service and overall value for my money. I won&#39;t be returning.."

We had to negotiate with the staff for ten minutes to see if the kitchen could make an exception to make a burger for my kids. The manager was dronelike and unkind... an interaction that would bother most people who come to a restaurant of this caliber... but given that it was Christmas day, I found it especially in poor taste that the manager gave us a hard time about making a burger for children and could not muster so much as a smile. Not exactly the spirit that one expects during the holidays.  

We ordered a coursed meal with appetizers, soup, salad, and entrees.  The appetizers were unimpressive: the stuffed mushrooms had sliced cheese melted on top. our entrees came immediately after our appetizers... The waiter forgot to serve our soup.  As far as the entrees went, the twice baked potatoes looked like they came from Wendy&#39;s drive thru and the steak was tasteless.  The roasted chicken was undercooked. 

They offered us dessert as a way to make up for the bad experience but it added insult to injury.  The cheesecake was dry and the chocolate cake tasted like cardboard.  

Chicago Prime was a fake version of quality downtown restaurants such as Wildfire, Morton&#39;s, or Capital Grille.  They are family owned and the impression I walked away with is this:  They were more interested in making a dollar than securing their reputation as serious fine dining. ... I can forgive bad food but there is no forgiveness for bad management, service, and treatment of others, especially on Christmas Day."

Nice restaurant, easy access from Algonquin, convenient from local hotels. I ordered the Dover Sole Meuniere and a side house salad with vinaigrette dressing. My friend ordered the lamb chops, a salad with oil and vinegar, and a glass of house Cabernet. We split calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was excellent, lightly battered and fried. Large portions, too. The sole was delicious. Light, flaky and tender, with just the right amount of lemon butter and served with sauteed julienne vegetables. The three moderate-sized lamb chops were cooked as ordered and also delicious. Reasonable prices for the quality and quantity of food. Waiter was attentive, professional and helpful without being annoying. Next time I&#39;ll try a steak."

Started with some oysters which were pretty good, served on ice. Got a vat of cocktail sauce I guess to fill the plate and a small nickel size dollop of horseradish, kind of funny. They don&#39;t separate the oyster from the shell which I find odd. Got the french onion soup which was pretty standard in flavor and slightly salty. It was not browned enough so looks anemic. I&#39;ve had it here before and it was better back then. Also had the octopus app and it was pretty sad. Totally overcooked, seemingly dry and chewy. I eat many different octopus dishes and this one isn&#39;t deserving even though you&#39;d think it had potential. Again I have had this here before and it was better but not great. Onto the Thai Buffalo wings... the most salty overpowered wing I have ever had. You need a loaf of bread just to balance it out. I ate 4 and was done, period. Couldn&#39;t even order dinner because of the overpowered flavor. But the bread and butter I had with the wings was great!!

I have been here 8-10 times and the service and quality is up and down. It&#39;s been great a few times and poor just as many times for the cooking or service. I rate is as 3 stars because it is middle of the road for a higher end steak house. I live locally so I will go back. I have had steaks &amp; lobster here and like I said it&#39;s up and down overall."

I started the meal with the escargot and a wedge salad. Super super good wedge salad, my favorite. 

I had the trio of crusted filets with gorgonzola, horseradish and parmesean. The gorgonzola was the best at the recommendation of the waiter and boy he was spot on. The meat was fantastic as a place known for their steaks should be and we shared sides of asparagus and lobster mac snd cheese. The veggies were nothing to write home sbout but the mac and cheese...so gooey and with the lobster flavor, i recommend it.

For dessert i had the cheesecake. Pretty good but not amazing.

I like this place for the steak and the ambiance.  They have beautiful portraits of the city. This is a classy place where you take someone to impress them. Ill come back for sure."

chicago-prime-steakhouse-schaumburg-5,Jennifer S.,mYvZwQ3T5JzqwOyURQWA_w,"Bartlett, IL",1,1,1,344,471,Hi3xVHV2Mb6ORM7V8SK9zA,3.0,2014-03-28,"I&#39;ve spent a considerable amount of time at Chicago Prime Steakhouse for both lunch and dinner, so I feel ready to share my thoughts. 

The parking lot can be busy, but they have valet service available. In the winter months, take advantage of this service. You&#39;ll be glad you did.  And regarding their parking lot. You&#39;ll want to turn in off of Meacham Road north of Algonquin Road a bit west of the restaurant. This seems to be the best way in.

During our most recent visit on Valentine&#39;s Day (double date with my sister and BIL who like to go out on occasions like these), I found that the waiting room in the foyer was limited because of a large table display. This wasn&#39;t the best use of the space when there are so many folks just trying to find a place to stand. 

We had a reservation and we didn&#39;t have to wait too, too long. That was a pleasant surprise!  Everyone was hungry, so it the 25 minutes felt like forever, but it really wasn&#39;t awful at all. 

Our server had been my server at a recent lunch a couple months prior. He recognized me and he was courteous through our entire meal. We could have used a bit more attention, but seeing as we chose to go out on Valentine&#39;s Day, I think it could have been worse.  We were really ready to eat when he made his way to us. Things just move a bit slow here no matter when I&#39;ve been here. I think they are going for a certain vibe and it&#39;s cool when it works, but after the 25 minute wait past the reservation time, bring some bread and get the show on the road. ;-)

The shrimp appetizer was garlicky and delicious!  Everyone was a fan which always makes me happy!  But the shrimp bisque left something to be desired. No one liked it at the table. I even tried multiple bites to make sure it wasn&#39;t an acquired taste sort of thing. Nope. I was right the first time. 

The steaks arrived exactly as we ordered them, but the side dishes were less than impressive this time. I will say that I love their crab cake and their calamari!  I&#39;ve had them both on multiple occasions and I&#39;ve been happy every time. 

It is not cheap to dine here. And over the holidays we were grossly overcharged - which was eventually sorted out - but only because a co-worker with a keen eye noticed the error. 

I feel like there is room for improvement and I imagine that they will, but for now, I&#39;m not running back soon."

Reservations made a month in advance on www.opentable.com which will earn you 100 points (for those of you that utilize this service) once you have dined.

My mom had given us some gift cards for CP a while back and we have been wanting to use them forever so with Valentine&#39;s day on it&#39;s merry way, I called up the sis and we made a double date for the big V-day. Typically they hate going out on Valentine&#39;s day and I didn&#39;t quite understand why...until tonight.

Pulled up to find COMPLIMENTARY VALET parking which was a bonus because their parking lot (or lack there of) sucks just about as much as the super cramped lobby area might at any restaurant of your choosing on a Friday night Valentine&#39;s day. (note to self: make a fancy dinner at home like everyone who&#39;s smart for a third of the cost next year) 

I get that they want to advertise their Zagat award and everything, but a giant 5&#39; table in the lobby area to display this plaque along with a number of bottles of liquor is unnecessary on Valentine&#39;s day. People are here to spend money on whatever their sweetie wants tonight, so lose the table for upcoming holidays, CP and make room for the patrons to stand!! After all, they are willing to wait to eat at your establishment; make it comfortable for them.

They sat us about 25-30 minutes after our reservation time, so that was pretty much annoying but I guess with it being a special occasion, I&#39;ll try to let that one slide. I would have thought that a month in advance would have been enough notice to allow for them to get us in a little closer to our reservation time but either way, moving on....

OK, let&#39;s get down to business...

- Took about 15 minutes to be greeted by a server. Not a fan.

- Ambiance: Excellent! Perfect date place. 

- The shrimp dijon appetizer was something that my late step-father would have absolutely loved. Garlicky and buttery and fantastic and perfect for 2-4 people. The app included 4 LARGE shrimp (oxymoron?).

- Bread: crusty on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. Served warm, the way it should be!

- Asked for butter that never came.

- Complimentary shrimp bisque: I was proud of myself for trying but it was just plain icky and it smelled. We couldn&#39;t wait for them to take it off the table. 

- All steaks were prepared properly. Pricing for their steak- way overpriced for what you get.

- Overcooked twice baked potato (Another oxymoron? Maybe a little. But nonetheless) $10 for something that should have not left the kitchen; I was not too please.

- Our server was SUPER nice but was rarely around. Again, it was Valentine&#39;s day so he was busy. Damn it! I want to like this place so much more than I did tonight!

Overall, they are getting a solid 3 stars from me because I think there is more here, but tonight was not the night for us.  I hope they work on their service and food prep because they could be so much better. 

For what we ended up spending even including the gift cards, we should have gone to Gibson&#39;s. I&#39;m disappointed."
chicago-prime-steakhouse-schaumburg-5,Lisa D.,SnRsDOK-Ng-E_gWPzfj-ew,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,9,nYKss4wvfscectHXeskELQ,1.0,2016-01-24,"I dined here last night with my husband.  We had reservations but the hostess told us that we would have to wait to get seated or that we could dine in the bar / lounge.  We decided to dine in the bar because it appeared that they were busy and we didn&#39;t want to wait for an indefinite amount of time even though we had reservations.  There was entertainment in the lounge and didn&#39;t think it would be a big deal to be seated there.  The table that they sat us in was closest to the entry to the bar / lounge so there were many people that would just stand in the entry way listening to the live singer.  It was annoying to be in that location because there were random people invading our space and just standing there.

Our waitress started us off with warm bread and butter and it was good. This was the best thing that they served to us.  We ordered our drinks, waited a few minutes and our waitress came to inform us of their steaks.  Ultimately, she ended up bringing us a tray of the main steaks that they offer.  The steaks on the tray were all watery and looked like they were left out at room temperature for many hours due to being showed to each table throughout the night.  I just hope that they don&#39;t end up cooking those &#34;display&#34; steaks because who knows how long they&#39;ve been at room temperature.  We ordered our steaks and each steak either comes with salad or soup.  We chose the shrimp soup and it tasted pretty good.  

When it came time for our steaks (the main reason why we&#39;re here), they were not tasty at all.  My husband ordered the cowboy ribeye and I ordered the prime rib. Both of our steaks lacked any taste.  They were served on plates drenched in aus jus sauce which I&#39;m thinking they were using to hide the fact that there was no taste to the steaks.  Our steaks were not cooked to a standard I would expect since they charge prices comparable to Ruth&#39;s Chris, Mortons and Gibsons.  My husband and I have dined at many Chicago steakshouses in the city and in the suburbs and this restaurant doesn&#39;t even meet expectation.  Considering that we&#39;re spending the same amount on a steak that you would find at a top steakhouse, this place is a rip off.  I wouldn&#39;t even put it in the same category as Wildfire.  

In regards to the red flags, I read other reviews online and some of the reviewers mentioned that they purchased restaurant.com coupons.  A fine establishment wouldn&#39;t offer discounts for you to eat at their restaurants; especially one that charges like they&#39;re one.  Secondly, I went to Costco this morning and they had discounted gift cards at the warehouse.  

My recommendation is to SKIP this place.  The food is lackluster.  Dine at Ruth&#39;s Chris, Morton&#39;s, Gibsons, Capital Grille or Perry&#39;s.  You&#39;re going to end up paying the same amount for delicious steaks and top notch service."

I made a reservation, showed up ten minutes early. Twenty minutes after the reservation time, I checked again. No news. People came, went, walk-ins were seated, and the wife and I sat. After 45 minutes and checking in three more times, I was told our table still wasn&#39;t ready. This is simple incompetence. Not a well run place. 

Here&#39;s where it gets fun. As we walked out - the hostess ran out the door after us &#34;don&#39;t you want your table?&#34; - I said &#34;yes, very much&#34; to which she replied &#34;so then why aren&#39;t you waiting for it, are you just going to blow us off then?!?&#34; I felt no need to reply to that, but felt a need to laugh. We were then reported as a no-show to OpenTable. 

I don&#39;t care if their steaks are seasoned with magic and unicorn tears, it&#39;s not worth the strife and poor professionalism. Go somewhere that has the first clue how to run a restaurant."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, because I don&#39;t mind throwing down my hard earned cash, if the food and atmosphere is good! I didn&#39;t have my hope up to high for this place, because some of the reviews that I saw on here, but I was going with a rather large group of people that wanted to go, so I went. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with everything concerning my personal experience with this restaurant. My wife had the lobster and steak with veggies and I had the pork chops. The pork chops were delicious and were probably some of the best pork chops that I ever had. However, my wife clearly made the better choice, because the lobster and steak was off the chain. The damage to my wallet wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought that it could be, so I definitely look forward to going back the next time that I have a business dinner. It&#39;s way better than driving to Chicago for some of the famous places that charge an arm and a leg and gave up on customer service long ago."

The steak was juicy but with a slight crispy char and cooked medium rare. Chicago Prime is a bit on the expensive side with steaks coming in around $55 for a 22 oz ribeye.

However the last 2 times at Chicago Prime, I have to say they have slipped from a 5 star powerhouse to a 4 star.  Food was still very good last night, but just was not phenomenal as it has been in the past.  I always order double Absolut Tonics, and last night the doubles were weak.  I do not like asking the wait staff to have my drink made strong(bartenders hate that, just order the double)  so I go with the double in a short glass.  No way I got 2 shots in my drink last night.  
I ordered the Cowboy Cut Ribeye.  It was good, not great.  Side items were the Asparagus, and Au Gratin Potatoes.  Both side items were excellent.  But who go to  Chicago Prime for the sides.

I&#39;m not a big fan of the &#34;steakhouse&#34; I don&#39;t get paying $58.00 for a bone in ribeye with zero sides. But the one thing you can usually count on is having a good steak. 

In this case, let&#39;s start with dirty martinis: the juice they used was oil based. So the drink was more like an oil slick. Not appealing. 

Next we had oysters on the half shell, grilled octopus and shrimp cocktail. The oysters were great, you don&#39;t have to cook those!  The shrimp ($20.00) were lacking flavor and a little tough. The octopus was served in odd overcooked strips that looked more like frog legs, served on an oily bed of green beans and potatoes. 

Next came our steaks, I had prime rib which was fine, but pretty flavorless, served with some rosemary horseradish sauce which tasted way too much like rosemary and not at all like horseradish. Had to ask for plain horseradish on the side. My friend had crab cake and filet. The crab cake was meh, but tasted of rosemary again (there must be a rosemary bush out back) which overpowered the subtlety of the crab cake served with some sickeningly sweet sauce that was supposed to he bernais but was inedible and not like any bernais I&#39;ve ever had. 

Next came cowboy ribeyes. One ordered rare, it was cooked correctly: other was medium rare. It was cooked well the first time,  We said for $58 you should send it back. He said it will come out rare. The manager brought it out. It was rare. He brought it back in a huff it was still rare but better.  The point is when &#34;steak&#34; is in the name of the joint they should at least know how to do that.   The sides were bland and flavorless. 

The owner sent over dessert to make up for it which was a nice gesture. Taking off the still not cooked correctly steak would have been a better one. 

When we left we all agreed the best food of our $500 bill for 4 people were the oysters ams the house salads. 

So save yourself a lot of money order oysters, house salad and a glass of wine and you should have a meal that justifies your bill."

Went on Easter Sunday for a 6:30pm reservation and we were rushed through practically every aspect of the entire experience by the servers (even though they were open until 8).  Was rushed through placing my order, server never asked if I wanted another drink, sides and plates were removed from the table before 3 people in our party were even finished with their entrees.  Literally half full side dishes were swept away by the servers!  My bacon wrapped filet was nothing special at all and tough and filled with sinu throughout.  The bacon wasn&#39;t cooked through and didn&#39;t even taste like bacon.  A very poor experience all the way around that I really wished would have been much better.  Just seemed that no one there even cared and we were offered absolutely nothing to make up for the poor experience except for a large check.  Even then, with 7 people in our party, the servers took it upon themselves to split up the check how they wanted to without asking, and I ended up with all of the sides and deserts on my check!  Absolutely awful... No reason to ever return here with so many other much better options..."

Certainly a good steakhouse just not outstanding. Ordered a filet trio special and got the impression that there were a hundred of these stacked up in the kitchen. Wouldn&#39;t take much to make it seem as if it was prepared just for you. Au gratin potatoes were very good. Sapphire martini was large and put together just right. Perhaps everything might have moved up a notch if the greeter had actually paid attention when I announced myself and hadn&#39;t just tossed some menus down at my table after she finally figured out what she was doing.

The last Saturday before Christmas. Tables full of large parties. People looking forward to celebrating with friends. A great steak, a great time! Well we were disappointed. Overbooked and understaffed, the crew were overwhelmed. But instead of explaining and asking for patience, the plan they implemented was to push the drinks and ignore the food. It was over an hour after we arrived that we were asked for our order. An hour! When the food arrived, nearly ninety minutes after we arrived, the server had forgotten who had what, and had gotten several of the &#34;doneness&#34; wrong. &#34;We can put that back on the grill, ma,am&#34; Not what you want to hear. The sauces with the steaks were cold. 
At this point patience gave out and dissatisfaction was politely registered. But nothing happened until I requested  the maitre d. Many words, but little action. Free dessert was delivered, a token only. Eventually and with great reluctance, we were credited some of the alcohol that was pressed on us while we waited. On a good night, it&#39;s probably a great experience, but shouldn&#39;t a restaurant like this guarantee a good night every night?"

This was my first time visiting here and I loved it. 

Location is a bit off. I realize the area is up and coming but it just seems to be in an odd area. The parking lot is small too but that should definitely not stop you from coming here. 

Upon walking in you are greeted instantly. We were seated within one minute.  I hate waiting, so this was a bonus. 

Sever had an awesome attitude and personality. He was patient with us (we brought our 1 year old to dinner) and expedited her meal so that we may enjoy ours. Checked on us often. I kept drinking my drinks and those glasses were constantly being filled. 

We sat by the fireplace which was nice and toasty. Very nice restaurant and one of the first things they tell you is that it is family owned. I like hearing that. 

Food was excellent. We had fried calamari which came with a zesty marinara. 
Filet mignon was cooked perfectly for me. But my guests&#39; steaks were cooked opposite of their preference. I think the ordered were switched around by accident. 
Mashed potatoes were garlicky and pretty tasty. I&#39;m not a big fan of mashed potatoes so I can&#39;t say much more. 
The saut√©ed mushrooms were absolutely my favorite dish. Everyone enjoyed them, including the baby! 
Dessert (tiramisu) was delicious beyond belief. Cannot complain about a single thing."

I wish I ordered Prime Rib, Ribeye, or Filet so I could give full review of the steak but I ordered the Southwestern Style Steak and it was good but it was covered in a spicy pepper sauce that masked the meat.  On the upside it was also covered with smoked sausage and shrimp which was pretty awesome.  I also ordered a side of julianne veggies.  I should have ordered the spinach dish.  For most high end a la carte steakhouses, you have to order sides to get full.  For Chicago Prime, I was full from just my steak plate and barely touched the veggies.

The service is exceptional and I even had the privilege of meeting the owner and his sons.  I had a great time!"

I had not been to this restaurant since they were at their old location.  I was deciding between Morton&#39;s or Buckingham&#39;s at the Elgin Casino but decided to give this place a try.  

I came here the day before Valentine&#39;s Day at around 10 p.m.  I started off with an order of Oysters Rockefeller.  At first we were brought the wrong appetizer &amp; had to wait 15 minutes for the new one, but this was no big deal to me.  I also had a cream of mushroom soup.  The soup was probably the best dish of the night.  The Oysters Rockefeller was pretty tough &amp; not that tastey.  

For our main course we ordered a filet mignon &amp; a porterhouse.  The porter house was huge at 28 oz &amp; before we ordered the waiter told us how great their meat was.  Once again when our food arrived we were very disappointed.  The steak did not melt in my mouth the way it had at other restaurants.  

Overall I was disappointed with our meal.  For two people with tip it was $200 &amp; I did not feel that I got my money&#39;s worth.  I&#39;m not sure if I would give this place another chance but it is possible."

Chicago Prime does not fall into that category. My steak did not come out sizzling-- at least put the steak on a plate that&#39;s been sitting in the oven for a few minutes. It was not seasoned at all. I had to salt my steak and have only had to do that at my in-law&#39;s retirement home. The au gratin potatoes were lukewarm.

The best part of the meal was the bread which was better than average. For the price, I would definitely go to a chain steakhouse like Ruth&#39;s Chris, Morton&#39;s or Capital Grille."

As soon as we got there, as newbies were shown the different cuts, I went with the Cajun Prime Rib medium rare. Perfectly cooked, it was really juicy and flaorvful and went perfect witht he the horseradish. Also the thai buffalo shrimp wings were good. The dessert menu is where i think they can improve. The lounge was packed and a great place to grab a drink if your early, only wished they had more signature cocktails.

We split the grilled portabello mushroom appetizer and a side of grilled asparagus.  Across the board the food was 5-star.  The steak was excellent, even for a filet.  (What do I mean by that?  There are many cuts of meat that are more flavorful, that Chicago Prime has.  I chose the filet since it tends to be a leaner cut of meat so that I can still get my dose of protein but with less fat.  USUALLY, that means a less flavorful steak compared to a bone-in rib eye, for instance.)
Our server, Tony, was very good - just the right amount of attentiveness.  Pacing was a little on the quick side but not to the point where we really felt rushed.

The only reason, I&#39;m not making this a 5-star review is their liquor pricing policy.  For my &#34;dessert&#34; beverage, I ordered a bourbon neat.  On the itemized bill, I was charged a $1.50 &#34;neat charge&#34; on top of the $10 drink charge.  It wasn&#39;t like I got a quarter glass of whiskey either.  When I&#39;m spending $210 (including tip), don&#39;t nickle and dime me because I ordered &#34;neat&#34;."

Our experience can only be described as weird. We made reservations and upon arrival the host asked us if seats in the lounge with the very loud lounge singer were acceptable. I told him I would prefer something else and he was very offended. He sat us in the dining room where we ordered Manhattans (which was the best part of our meal). I ordered the NY strip and my husband ordered the bone in rib eye. Both steaks were served warm, not hot, on a plate in which they had obviously been resting. Beneath the luke warm steaks was a puddle of juice. It was not appetizing. They garnished the steak with rosemary which seemed out of place and silly. The Caesar salad dressing tasted like it came out of a bottle and they put way too much on the lettuce. My husband&#39;s house salad was also quite mushy with dressing. The bread came late and there were no butter knives on the white table cloths. We buttered our bread with massive steak knives. They could not wait to get us out of the dining room despite the empty tables that surrounded us.

Anyways....Took my wife to prime to spend Valentine&#39;s day dinner.  My wife made reservations online but of course our reservation got lost in the world wide web.  5 mins later they found our seat and our table was a bit tiny but that&#39;s ok it&#39;s l&#39;m spending Valentine&#39;s day with my wife.
My wife ordered the lobster and steak and I believe I had the ribeye and nasty crab cakes and over cooked calimari  they recommended.  As we ate our dinner I looked in my wife&#39;s eyes and told her l loved her.  Then a single tear rolled down her cheek as she told me she loved me too.  So I asked her why she&#39;s crying.  She said....she&#39;s crying because her food sucks...dried and salty.  Then I broke into tears for my food was also salty and over cooked medium rare was what I ordered but got salty steak cardboard..the char was borderline burnt.
So we sat there staring at each other not knowing if we should finish our dinner or get up and leave the uncertainty was so overwhelming.  At that very moment our souls connected once again...sharing a common moment, a common bond and mutual agreement that we would never return to Prime Steakhouse again.  We walked out of there spending about $270 with tip for appetizers a couple drinks and dinner for two....if that helps anyone.  Over price for bad food???? I don&#39;t get it ACTUALLY!!! I got it alright if you know what I mean."

It was a Friday night and our number for the reservation kept changing, but they didn&#39;t seem to mind.  When we got there, the Manager was at the front desk and made sure to wish me a Happy Birthday, already big points in my book!  We were then taken to our tables, which had firepits in them....yup, firepits!  Our server, Gina, well I don&#39;t even know what I can say about Gina, except that she definitely made my birthday one to remember.  We all had drinks and took full advantage of their delicious food.  My friend and I split the full slab of ribs, which in my opinion were some of the juiciest, tastiest, fall off the bone ribs I&#39;ve ever had.  My boyfriend had a delicious cheeseburger and fries.  We had a large group but everything from the salmon to the amazing key lime pie was perfection!  While the food was fantastic, the service is really what I should be raving about....

As I said, Gina, was probably one of the most attentive, spunky servers I&#39;ve had the experience of dining with.  She truly made our evening one for the books!   I got not only one round of key lime pie, complete with candles and of course singing, but TWO! How nice is that??!  They also had a live band inside, which we didn&#39;t take full advantage of, being that we were outside, but it&#39;s definitely something worth checking out!"

First of all, they gave you a small, cold, partial loaf of bread.  Then they gave you a slab of cold butter.  Not whipped, not aerated, just a slab.  Have you ever tried to smear cold butter on a cold roll, it doesn&#39;t work.  You end up tearing the roll.  Then I ordered oysters on the half shell.  Their shucking was awful.  On two of the shells, there was so much cracked shell pieces in it that I had to take a few minutes pulling shell pieces out of my mouth.  They weren&#39;t even that flavorful.  For $16, I would expect something closer to perfection than this.  Next, their french onion soup was good, so let&#39;s pass that.  After that, I got the strip steak.  When I was young, I was trained to cook by an old professional caterer that has done $500 per plate dinners.  If you put something on the plate, it has to be edible without ruining the food.  They shoved a branch of rosemary on my steak, completely raw.  She would have cussed the steak all the way back to the chef.  Second, they charred both sides, and the center was Warm, bordering on cold.  They did season both sides luckily, and the seasoning was good, and sure, some charring adds some flavor, but when you over char something, it turns bitter.  Very bitter.  There were 2 bites in that 13 oz. steak that made me cringe from bitterness, lack of flavor, and even chewyness.  For being a $44 dry-aged steak, it tasted like a soggy $5 bargain steak.  It just wasn&#39;t worth the price.  Just not worth the price."
chicago-prime-steakhouse-schaumburg-5,Aimee M.,RO3vznPVVw5NWcgfP3k17A,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,365,167,SFVtZbFhuJTQGZvysWfOvQ,5.0,2011-10-16,"Right off the bat, my husband and I are warmly welcomed as we enter. We don&#39;t even reach the hostess desk when Andy John says, &#34;Hey guys, welcome back, it&#39;s been awhile&#34;. He even wishes us a Happy Anniversary and takes a little time to make some friendly chit chat. Color me super-impressed. I always knew Andy John and company took so much pride in every little detail of their restaurant, but to remember patrons is totally above and beyond what I expected. 

We were early for our dinner reservations so we enjoyed some drinks in the bar area first. A refreshingly tasty Cosmo for me and Becks Dark for the man. The bar is gorgeous and def swanky. There was live entertainment--male and female duo singing some old school and modern lounge-y songs. Very talented voices, smooth entertainment. To be fair to the sports fans, they did have College Football and playoff baseball on the flatscreens (no volume) as well. 

We had really wanted to hit a downtown Chicago steakhouse for our anniversary, but folks close to me know why we sometimes have to stay out in the &#39;Burbs now. But no matter, we weren&#39;t disappointed--Chicago Prime is very sleek and the atmosphere is definitely more &#34;Downtown&#34; than it is &#34;Schaumburg&#34;. Service is impeccable. My husband couldn&#39;t decide on the wine so our server brought two samples to taste to help him decide. Plates are removed and placed silently and with very little interruption of dinner. He was also very knowledgeable about wine. Like I said, impeccable. 

The food is top-notch and delicious. 
Escargot with toast points--Buttery, Garlicky, goodness 
Shrimp Bisque--Delicious, smooth--scrape the bowl good. 
Cowboy Cut Rib-Eye, Medium--cooked to perfect Medium, an excellent cut with excellent flavor. This is a huge cut and made for excellent leftovers the next day. 
Creamed spinach--I love spinach and I loved that you can still taste the spinach in this dish and it wasn&#39;t drowned in cream and buried under cheese. Very very good. 
Dessert was the Apple Purse--get your cameras ready if you order this (we missed a picture opportunity) because it is a gorgeous presentation of cinnamon, walnuts and apples wrapped in phyllo dough in the shape of a tied-off purse, served with a side of rich vanilla ice cream and topped with a drizzle of caramel. A perfect desert for Fall or for apple-lovers. 

We got a gift certificate for a free desert for our next visit. I think next time I&#39;m bringing the gals. Perfect place for date night, girls night or for something special. Loved every bit of Chicago Prime."

We tried Chicago Prime Steakhouse on a recommendation. It isn&#39;t as suit &amp; tie as many other steak places. It actually is comfortable in jeans to suits. 

The only thing you need to make sure is you bring your appetite. 

We started with the Cajun Scallops and the Grilled  Portabella Mushrooms appetizers. They were awesome. I am not a big mushroom fan but with the softened garlic, this was great. 

My wife had the Prime Rib and I had a New York. Both were fantastic and the left overs the day after (today) only tasted better. 

The garlic mashed potatoes were fantastic with bits of real garlic. 

We will definitely return. I&#39;ll recommend it too."

The food is excellent, the wine selection superb and the wait staff are true professionals.

We have worked our way through most of the menu at Prime over the last couple of years.

Escargot, calamari, beet salad.. check, check.. check.. 
Well prepared and flavorful without being too much.
For those at the table not interested in eating snails, simply dipping the table bread (which is excellent as well) into the butter sauce is a treat unto itself.

Filet, sirloin, ribeye, prime rib, salmon, halibut.  Check, check, check, check and yup.. check.. 

Every entree we have had at Prime has been excellent.
Make sure you know what rare, medium rare, medium etc.. actually mean when ordering a steak at Prime.  Because THEY do know and that&#39;s how you will get your steak.  This is not Outback.  And thankfully, it is also not Morton&#39;s.

If, after the excellent bread, tasty appetizers, crispy salads and savory entree, you still have room for dessert, you are in for a treat.
Creme Brulee and the truly decadent chocolate cake with raspberry sauce are two of our favorites along with the most recent special of strawberries, vanilla ice cream and a sinfully rich cream sauce.

While the menu is excellent at Chicago Prime, one of my favorite things about the place is that the atmosphere in the place is up to date.  While there is no doubt you&#39;re in a steakhouse and the decore is upscale, it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;ve walked into a cave.  
Their dining room is spacious and they can accomodate larger parties in a separate room, they also have a very inviting lounge area.
With live music most nights, we tend to park ourselves at a high top, have dinner listen to some good music and hang around for a while.
For special events or when we&#39;re entertaining friends, we&#39;ll head to the dining room and spread out a bit.

If you like a great steak, done exactly as you asked for, along with all the traditional steakhouse sides and some not so traditional, you will love Chicago Prime.

We&#39;ll see you there!"

We sat in the bar area where the decor blew me away along with the bartender who was very knowledgeable of the menu and had great recomendations like the appetizer....it was a shrimp, garlic, lemony...crunchy something or another we normally wouldn&#39;t order but thankfully did! The food was great and the steak 22oz Filet and 22oz ribeye were like Flinestone size along with the mashed potatoes....yumm-o. 

The normal menu prices are along the same numbers as Morton&#39;s or Smith &amp; Wollensky. Definitely won&#39;t leave hungry or wondering why the bill was so high."

I really really do.  Had I reviewed them based on my previous 2 experiences rather than my most recent one, it definitely would be a 5 star experience.  I can only hope that they were having an off night.

Service is usually stellar and attentive.  The only thing I can say that was great about our service this past weekend was that our water glasses were never empty.  The waitress did admit to us that she was new.  She never gave us her name, and did not take us through the spiel of bringing out the cuts of meat, explaining them, talking about the specials, etc... she just handed us menus.  There were other servers around the restaurant treating their customers with much more care.

What we&#39;ve ordered in the past, and have found to be absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked, no complaints:
- Lamb Chops.  succulent and juicy, perfect medium rare
- Cowboy cut Ribeye. Again, perfectly cooked.
- Thai Buffalo shrimp.  More like prawns.  Delicious, tender, good seasoning.
- Scallop appetizer.  Again, perfect, and we all know how easy it is to mess up scallops.
- Creamed Spinach
- Asparagus

On our last visit (this past Sunday, with the sub-par waitress,) everything seemed to be sub-par, and it made me sad.

We ordered: 

1 macadamia crusted halibut, which came out fine.
3 cowboy cut ribeye steaks, all medium rare.  Mind you, this is a $42 steak.  All three came out overcooked.  One was medium, and my mom battled through and ate it.  My sister&#39;s and mine came medium well to well done.  I never send food back, but I can&#39;t eat a steak past medium rare.  
Twice baked potato - good flavor, but came out only luke-warm.
Mashed sweet potatoes - good, again, but not hot.

They did take the steaks back and re-cook them right away.  Immediately following the server offered me another glass of wine, which I accepted, and had assumed would be comped.  Nope.  They didn&#39;t comp anything for the trouble.  No desserts, no glasses of wine.  I was a little put off by that, especially since the owner came over to our table several times through the meal, and was aware of the issue with 2 steaks being sent back due to being overcooked.

The icing on the cake came when it was time to order dessert.  My dad asked for just one scoop of vanilla ice cream, which the server enthusiastically said no problem!  My sister and I got our desserts, and the ice cream never came.  The server dropped the check, and ran.  She avoided contact with our table for the rest of the evening.  Her demeanor completely changed.  What I assume happened is that she thought she could just bring out a scoop of ice cream, and someone told her she&#39;d have to charge for it.

So, not my best experience at Chicago Prime, but I&#39;d love to go back and give them another shot, since the first 2 times I ate there it was amazing."

However the steak was not. My cousin and I both had the Cowboy Cut Ribeye prepared Medium. The char on the outside was borderline unbearable. The quality of the overall steak wasn&#39;t bad but it didn&#39;t have the flavor profile of an aged steak. I probably wouldn&#39;t go back or recommend friends or family to visit either.

Great food and a better value than most of the large chain prime steakhouses.  All of our steaks were amazing, and the sauces were wonderful.  Even the salads stood out.

Our server was far too casual coming up to our table ( the only one in the restaurant aside from a party) saying &#34;what would you like to drink?&#34; Without an introduction. The wine we chose was delish though :)

Parts of the meal were good: my filet was perfect, julienne veggies were amazing. My husbands bone in ribeye was overcooked and we would have told our server but he disappeared after serving our food for quite some time...

For dessert I went the liquid route and got the key lime pie martini. When it arrived, the graham cracker rim the menu mentioned was missing. We asked what happened tony said he&#39;d never seen it before. When we pointed the words out on the menu he offered an apology and walked away. Our check was presented without our asking, I would have liked another cocktail but apparently it wasn&#39;t in the cards.

Thank you tony and Chicago prime steakhouse for a memorable 2nd wedding anniversary."

More business than romantic that&#39;s for sure! There are other steakhouses in the neighborhood which are decent but you can&#39;t really go wrong here."

Me: Really? I love Chicago Prime, but it&#39;s in Schaumburg. You don&#39;t want to go to Gibsons? It&#39;s so close to your hotel... we could walk there!

Sister: No. I WANT Chicago Prime!

Me: I make dreams happen. Let&#39;s do this.

And off we went. Without traffic, it&#39;s actually a short trek from the city (only about 25 minutes) and you&#39;ll be greeted with easy, breezy strip mall parking and valet if you prefer it. 

Now for the meat of this review. It&#39;s been said, but I&#39;ll say it again: The interior of this restaurant is le gorgeous. Greek owner Andy-John and his father overhauled this space and put more than a million bucks into it (outcome? It looks like a billion bucks!). The digs are beautifully appointed with dark wood, sleek, oversized booths and the sexy, dim lighting you&#39;d expect from a serious steakhouse. Make-out nooks galore!

And to start and supplement the beef-to-come, you must try the Thai Buffalo Shrimp (just go ahead and order two portions, upfront), the chopped salad with sherry vinaigrette, and the double baked potato. I always get the juicy 6-ounce filet cooked perfectly to medium rare... even though the flavor of the wet-aged beef is on point, I do like to dip every other bite into that decadent, heart-stopping Bernaise sauce. I know, I&#39;m a bad girl. Do save some room for the cr√®me br√ªl√©e... my sister once ate the whole portion by herself when my appetite let me down!

Chicago Prime&#39;s thoughtful wine list enhances the hearty fare but you should also try an expertly-mixed cocktail by a certain former White Sox player (this is the embarrassing portion of the review where I blank on a name). Or, more embarrassing: Andy is trying to marry me off to his brother. Will I become Chicago Prime royalty? Only time will tell.

For now, I&#39;ll just keep eating here until I&#39;m too chubby to be considered a respectable Greek bride. But wait..."

Prices are in line with the likes of Maestro&#39;s, Chicago Cut, Capital, Shula&#39;s, Ruth Chris, Morton&#39;s, etc.  I break my steak houses into must hit great locations and second tier, this would be second tier.

If I&#39;m out in the burbs I would consider this place but to compare them straight up I wouldn&#39;t return.

Service was very nice, several folks stopped by to see how we were doing which was great.  Decor is ok, weird photo&#39;s of the Chicago sky line which I didn&#39;t get, big place, decent looking bar.  

Wasn&#39;t very crowded on a Saturday night which makes me wonder.

I did the steak and cake which was a filet and a crab cake.  Bumped mine up from a 6 ounce to a 10 ounce.  Wife did a bone in rib eye.  Can&#39;t say either really wowed me, they weren&#39;t bad but they weren&#39;t anything great either.  I think these guys have a tendency to cook a bit more than what I&#39;m used to.  My medium rare was medium without any question, wife&#39;s and our friends as well.  They were consistent but more done than not so I would order one level rarer than you normally do from my experience.

Crab cake was boring and very shredded consistency.  I prefer lump style personally.  Mac and Cheese skip as it&#39;s not very good.  Wasabi mashed were interesting, very strong wasabi which I didn&#39;t mind but many people may be put off by this.  The &#34;bacon sticks&#34; which was pork belly was over cooked and a skip for any future diners.  Cajun scallops were average, feel like I could get better quality scallops at Whole Foods and cook them better.  Not seared properly.  Shrimp bisque was solid and I would order that again.  Tiramisu was very good.

Wine list was ok, across the bored wines to meet basic needs.  Decent quality but not anything great.  Little pricey but not terrible.  Cocktails were solid but I stayed basic, good pour so ok with price.

Overall an average experience which would drive me to better places.  Nice staff which might draw me back if I wanted a steak as I do not know any other places in the area."

Horrible experience in every way - when we got there, we were seated in a back corner where a light was flickering and bothersome. When we asked the hostess to move us, the only option was a couple tables away, which was still a problem. At times, I wondered if I would have a seizure due to the lighting and struggled to read the menu.

Service was spotty in terms of being checked on and we also found out that we never received a specials menu (found this out after we had placed our order). When it was time to order, we got extremely frustrated. The waiter disagreed with us on how to have our meat cooked so wouldn&#39;t enter it how we asked, so we ended up with it not to our liking and mine even had to be sent back (asked for Medium Well and it was still bloody). The food overall was very disappointing. 

I would have been happy to share our feelings with someone at the restaurant, but that would have required being asked. From the time we sat down til when we left, no one other than the waiter checked in to see if everything was ok. This was especially frustrating since I noticed a manager stopping several times at the table next to us to make sure they were satisfied.

Not only did I leave the restaurant upset from the experience and dissatisfied from the food, but spent the rest of the weekend apologizing to my family who was in town for the horrible night out that was a waste of time and money. I shared this experience with the restaurant and got a call from the owner full of empty promises and never heard from him again. I was open to trying it again until he didn&#39;t follow up on anything he said to me.

There are way too many good steak places in the northwest suburbs to every settle for Chicago Prime Steakhouse again."

Pros: clean and modern, very good soup and bread, tasty mushrooms.

Cons: overpriced, steak was not cooked to order (medium rare vs. medium as ordered). I never return food back so my steak was pretty much beef sashimi :)

Sincere advice for the owners: 

1) Cut prices by at least 10%.
2) Offer good &#34;value&#34; red wine for around $25 a bottle
3) Ask waiters not to call customers &#34;hon&#34; as it is not a diner
4) Add a free side with every entree

The food was good however after eating half of a french dip sandwich and a few fries, I noticed a hair underneath the pile of fries. It was pretty disgusting! After mentioning it to the waiter the manager came over and asked if we planted it there. It was kind of shocking to be accused of that. After I answered him that I did not plant it there he laughed it off as a joke. I didn&#39;t think it was very funny though. The french dip was comped however and we were brought a desert, which in my opinion was the right thing to do. The food was okay, the atmosphere was decent, and our server was great.

The waiter told us that the steaks were in the top 2% of American steaks.  You could have fooled me.  Steaks also seemed to be carelessly cooked.  My medium was slightly burned in places and too rare in the middle.  The flavor of my steak was completely unmemorable.  The bottle of wine we ordered is one we buy from time to time at Binny&#39;s for $30, was $75 (I know restaurant&#39;s charge more but come on).

We wanted to keep things (foodwise) as similar as they were the first time to see if overall, they just had a bad night when we went on Valentines Day.

Yay! This time they had the steak presentation. It&#39;s just a necessity.

Drinks: I again had the Key Lime Pie martini. Still think that the rim needs that graham cracker crust, but that aside the best in the area. I would return for drinks alone, based on them. 

Husband had Hacker-Pshorr, with a lemon. 

Food:
We did not go the escargot route this time. However, still started off with the Thai Shrimp. Still huge, good shrimp - firm consistency. Had a nice kick. Not as Hooter-ish tasting this time. More sweet. Liked them so much that I ate them all, not leaving any room for soup, and limited room for my steak.

Husband had the mushroom caps again. He was happy with them as well.

Main Courses:

I again ordered the Cowboy Cut Rib-Eye, Medium Rare. While I did love the flavor of the cut, I still found it to be a bit well done for my liking. Maybe next time I will order it rare. Maybe it&#39;s just me. But that being said, the flavor was good, and the cut was much improved. 
For my side, I had garlic mashed potatoes. I liked the flavor and the texture was great. 

My husband had the Porterhouse well done. He enjoyed his cut. It was cooked perfectly for him and had great flavor. He also had the sauteed mushrooms and liked those as well.

My son had chicken fingers and steak fries, and for a kid who said going into the place that he wasn&#39;t going to eat anything. He ate almost all of it. Loved the BBQ sauce as well.

My daughter had the cheeseburger and Sweet Potatoes. She was extremely excited because she is obsessed with Sweet potatoes. She also did not leave any room for her burger, though I have to say -- the burger was not kid size. It was one big ass cheeseburger. Two of us ate it the next day and were quite full. It was good.

For dessert we had the key lime pie. My kids and I loved this pie! It was great. My husband prefers more tartness with his key lime pie. So, more for us. We were fine with that.

All in all it was a much better visit to the CPS and we will be back again, probably without my kiddos."

Then I had a problem with an online/app order where it wasn&#39;t even ready after 15 minutes when it was supposed to be ready.  But being a huge fan, I gave them another pass.

The last straw came last weekend; I had a fairly large order plus a whole chocolate cake.  The total amount seemed too low so I asked the cashier if he got the chocolate cake and he assured me that he got it and seemed put off that I even asked him to check.  So I waited for my order and kept waiting until I noticed that no one else was waiting and no other orders were in queue (it was later at night).  I asked a group of workers who we&#39;re socializing with each other what happened to my order.  They finally checked and another worker pointed out that my order bags had been ready and they should&#39;ve packed up our fries a while ago (I ordered nothing complicated: beefs, hot dogs and fries!!).  

Then I asked where the cake was and they said it wasn&#39;t on my order; I tried to keep my cool and asked how can I get one. So they point to the bar and I go there and no one is there; so they told me to go back to the cashier.  At that point my sister was mad and asked to speak to a manager. He or someone else told her to go back to the bar-ugh!! We get there and they are like there is no whole chocolate cake available unless we waited another 30 minutes. We couldn&#39;t wait any longer and why didn&#39;t they tell us this before we ordered?? They only had 3 slices of cake left.  Unfortunately since the birthday recipient specifically wanted Portillo&#39;s cake we had to buy the last 3 slices.  Then another customer came by and wanted to buy chocolate cake too and they told her there wasn&#39;t any left.  She stormed out and said this always happens to her there-whoa! 

When we finally got home from this ordeal, our hot dogs were way soggy-not cool Portillos!

They get that 1 star because the pasta orders came out fast and quality of the chicken Parmesan and marinara sauce was good as usual.

My sister mentioned that Dick Portillo always made customer service his top priority (according to a book she read).  Now that he sold Portillo&#39;s, she thinks that can explain why they are slowly going downhill and also, they are expanding too fast.  She  lives in Milwaukee and she said the newly opened Portillo&#39;s there is painful to go to because they can&#39;t get it right. After this ordeal at what used to be the best Portillo&#39;s, I think her theory is right."

You know, it is very hard in my option to mess up a grill cheese but, Portilios did an awesome job! 

I was starving and hadn&#39;t eaten in quite a while and thought I would get a hotdog and large cheese fries with chocolate shake. All three were great and as usual hit the spot like no other. I got the jumbo dog when unusually I get a regular and I wish I had. If the dog as a whole was larger it would had been better. Cheese fries..... I wish I had 4 hands so I can give the fries 4 thumbs up.

So why a two star? I asked multiple people if they had grill cheese and  they said yes. I got excited and and ordered one. Then as I&#39;m getting my food I said I didn&#39;t know they had grill cheese. The girl said they don&#39;t they have cheese sandwiches. That peaked my interest. I opened it and I was just cheese between two buns. Buns were slightly toasted on the inside. Cheese was not melted. No what melted? My broken heart. I really wanted a grill cheese and instead got a cheese sandwich you got as a 5 year old for lunch because your parents were In a rush a didn&#39;t want to take the time to grill it. Hello Portilio&#39;s, grilled cheese means toasted on outside and melted cheese.

I took a bite and it was what I expected. A fail. So thanks for bumming me out at the end of the night Portiolo&#39;s :("

Their milkshakes are really good as well it&#39;s not to thick or liquidity it&#39;s just right. One drawback about portillo&#39;s is a the drive thru line is so long.Their Chocolate cake is great, it has a light texture and also there is not that much frosting.

Most people go to &#39;Tillos for the beef or Chicago dogs, but there are countless fans of their char grilled burger - like me - who will pick that over the other items day after day.

Possibly one of the most repeatable and tasty burgers out there. Worthy of 5 stars... So why do I give portillos four stars? I feel the other food is a bit overrated. Sure, it&#39;s a good beef and a good dog, but I&#39;ve had better in multiple places around Chicago. The same can be said of the burger as well, but that happens to be their best offering (and genuinely excellent) so I choose to highlight that in my review. The other reason I give them 4 stars is that they are relatively expensive and slow for a &#34;fast food&#34; places. And my final nit, the burger doesn&#39;t always taste the same: every so often is lacks proper seasoning and salt.

The other terrific food item I must point out is the chopped salad at Barnelli&#39;s... amazing.

Solid food - I recommend the bacon cheeseburger with American (cheddar - my regular favorite on burgers - is pretty bad here) and the chopped salad."

Anyone can find something to eat. You can see there children, teens, young adults, parents, and seniors. We are not going there often, but every time I am at Partillo&#39;s, it&#39;s always special. Employees are always polite, patient and trying their best to serve you.

The chopped salad is also tasty if you feel like having something &#34;healthy&#34; when you go to Portillo&#39;s. 

The only reason I&#39;m giving this 4 stars is because I&#39;m not a fan of any of their sides. Their fries, fried mushrooms, and onion rings are pretty standard and somewhat dry. I would say skip those and just get an Italian beef with a side of a chili dog or a shake instead!"

We went through the drive thru on our way home from a trip, and were completely ignored by the two employees arguing with each other in the drive thru lane. When my wife asked, &#34;Do we order here?&#34; one of them waved us on. We pulled forward to the next employee, wearing a headset, pen and pad of paper in hand, who was immediately joined by who we assumed was the manager (big guy in sweater vest and tie) who pulled Headset Guy&#39;s attention away from us and starting telling him to do Something. Headset Guy walks back into an employee entrance while Manager side-eyes us and turns away, walking over to the two employees who had been arguing... leaving us to sit, ignored, in the drive thru. Maybe because it was 3:30 in the afternoon and not during Portillo&#39;s usual rush, we were simply forgotten. I guess.

I arrived home with the food still hot....GOOD SIGN! My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger and large fries. We usually share the large fries. He thought his burger tasted great. Fries were great as usual. My food was good, but I noticed a couple things were off tonight. My dipped Italian beef with sweet peppers when I unwrapped it had an additional third paper underneath the sandwich that I have never seen before. Because of this, the back side of my sandwich wasn&#39;t completely dipped to my liking. Tasted amazing still, but i was disappointed in that. I also ordered a Chicago style hot dog with everything except the peppers.

I can&#39;t think of a time when this place hasn&#39;t been busy, and being busy tends to lead to a lot of mistakes.

Tonight, I experienced another mistake, and this review is not meant to mark the occasional one because I feel occasional mistakes don&#39;t warrant a bad rating. Everyone makes a little screw-up here and there, but I&#39;ve surely had more than a dozen within maybe 2 years. I can&#39;t pin the blame on a single staff member because there are so many people involved in the assembly, so it falls onto the managers.

Portillo&#39;s is kind of like AT&amp;T. Sometimes, a bigger business makes it difficult to manage all of the little things. I know it won&#39;t stop me from visiting, but I&#39;ve gotta express my disappointment somewhere other than the counter.

I like mine with both sweet and hot peppers. The bread is a big reason; it tastes good and holds the juicy sandwich together while you chomp on it. It is not gummy and it doesn&#39;t fall apart while you eat. The meat is subtly-flavored, not too salty. I occasionally sense a bit of garlic in the recipe.

Since they changed ownership, however, the onion rings just don&#39;t cut it anymore. The serving is much much smaller and it has a thicker, darker breading which hasn&#39;t much flavor. Blah. They put it in a small container to make it look like it&#39;s falling all over the place, but it is much less to eat than before. An order used to fill a plastic basket. I like a nice side to go with my sandwich. The hot dog seems smaller too. I&#39;d skip that stuff. What a disappointment. Could have been a 5*.

They haven&#39;t messed with the beef yet, but they may be trying to cut costs. I&#39;d say, that&#39;s a big risk. I drive a ways to get there, and I pass by a lot of very good places to eat along the way."

Oh BTW get the Italian beef when you come here unless you&#39;re a vegetarian then by all means dig into their amazing and also beloved salad bar! (Not gonna lie I have yet to try it but nevertheless it looks very popular. 

Anyway. I get the beef with mozzarella and peppers, DIPPED. Yes I like it dipped people, it&#39;s the way it was meant to be enjoyed when Mr Portillo created these bad boys  (totally made that last part up but sounds about right)

My gf gets the beef with cheddar and peppers, NOT DIPPED! with the gravy on the side. She dips as she goes which I GUUEEESSS is ok but dipped is my suggestion 

Last time we went they dipped my gf&#39;s and she was so disappointed and didn&#39;t even eat it. I called (she was so mad she made me call) and I talked to Cisco who is the manager and let me just say this. Cisco is the embodiment of professionalism, he took total charge of the situation and offered me a replacement immediately however I wasn&#39;t around anymore. I came the next day and asked for him and without thinking he orders my gf her beef just the way she wanted and threw in a piece of chocolate cake (and wow what an amazing cake that is) to make things right 

Wow I&#39;m a customer for life, this place is famous for a reason... And as far as beefs go it&#39;s the best in Chicago and that&#39;s coming from a Chicagoan of 27 years"

Definitely a repeat restaurant...and yeah we&#39;ve already been back.  First off the place is huge.  We took the whole family there and they had something for everyone.  The service was good and the food was delicious.  I had the Portillo&#39;s Hot Dog (Chicago Dog fully loaded), a Italian Beef, fries and a shared Cake Shake.  First the Italian Beef, good but I probably would have it again from here.  Second the Portillo&#39;s Dog...uh...yeah I&#39;ll be ordering these again.  So good!!! Then the fries, good but when you add cheese, great.  Lastly, the cake shake...uh...out of this world.  So good that we&#39;ve already been back for this awesome shake.

In other words, this place is not a great place to go if your short on time and want to pick something up for a quick lunch or dinner.  As you can see, their to go line reaches across their entire parking lot making the probability that you will be stuck in that line for a good 20 minutes 99.97%. 

Like every other Portillo&#39;s I&#39;ve ever been to, the first thing i ordered was an Italian Beef sandwich and some Fries.  Though unlike my previous experiences, when i received my food, I could clearly see AND taste the fact that they burnt my bread.  Due to not wanting to bother arguing with the staff due to a group of cheerleaders already doing so, i quietly &#34;crunched&#34; through the burnt and hard bun, ruining my experience and giving me a bad vibe later as i was supposed to go bowling.  Overall, there are plenty of other Portillo&#39;s around the suburbs, give or take that it would most likely take a good 15-20 minutes from this location, i by far, suggest to not eat here unless your lucky enough to come at a time when they are not busy, and if they messed up your order, make sure they know that they messed up your order."

I&#39;ve lived, gone to school, and/or worked within walking distance of this location for basically my entire 27 years. 

But here&#39;s the thing about me. If you were to stop me outside of Portillo&#39;s and ask to see what&#39;s in my bag, you won&#39;t ever find a hot dog. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love me some hot dogs! Just not from Portillo&#39;s. They&#39;re never that hot and the buns get kinda gummy from hanging out in the steamers.

So what do I get at Portillo&#39;s? Cheeseburgers, fo sho. These cheeseburgers are super serious genuine char-broiled greasy deliciousness. Be warned- if you order a burger, you&#39;re gonna wait way longer than if you had ordered a hot dog. Why? Because they&#39;re not cooked yet. I see that as a plus.

I&#39;m also a huge fan of their corn roll tamales, which are not authentic tamales in any way, shape, or form. They&#39;re more like chili-filled cornbread pudding. I can&#39;t describe them in any way that sounds appetizing, so you&#39;ll just have to trust me.

Portillo&#39;s also has the world&#39;s best caesar salad dressing. This is a scientific fact. You can never go wrong with a chicken caesar salad. The classic chopped salad also gets two thumbs up from me.

As great as the food is, the drive-thru is terrible. A few years back they completely re-built and demolished the original building in order to give the lines (and drive-thru) a better flow. It didn&#39;t work. The line at lunch can be more than 15 cars long, and you&#39;ll have to order from one person, take your ticket to another, and then pay another, and then wait for them to finally make and deliver your food to your car. If there&#39;s an SUV in front of you waiting, forget about sneaking away after you get your food. Good thing french fries taste better in the car!"

Salad dressing cups are 1/2 the size .  Ask for a extra.
Plastic utensils are now cheap and bend easy.
Pasta portions reduced.  Lower quality chicken in the chopped salad.  And they reduced their all star staff to minimum wage rookies.  Order mix ups and long wait in lines is more common.

Overall it&#39;s still a good place, however we no longer come here as often.  There&#39;s too many other places in the area where they care about improving quality, not reducing."

Although I live about a mile away, I rarely go to Portillo&#39;s simply because that parking lot can be sheer terror with the drive through vs. shopping center vs. people going inside to eat.  I&#39;m only writing this now because I hope somebody in management reads it.  First off-- I got what I ordered, and it was delicious.  That being said--there&#39;s a sign that says other fast food places prepare our food behind walls.  Perhaps Portillo&#39;s should consider making that move.  As we walked along the salad station, the workers were literally flinging ingredients everywhere, including back into the product bins.  It was a mess and totally unappetizing.  The hot dog man wins for cleanest station.  The buns were falling off the chain on the cabinet.  There was food flying everywhere.  Finally at the pickup station, we were stacked up about 9 deep.  Total confusion on the part of the young man and young lady, and the three managers who were 8 feet away were seemingly far more focused on the drive through that those of us who were really hungry inside.   10 minutes later we got our bag tossed onto the counter and our number called.

Get the beef dipped - I think over the years the sandwich got a little smaller and drier. Still good memories.

Chopped salad was not good as I remembered but maybe because I had the hot dog and beef first. I also tried cake shake and I&#39;m not a fan. The consistency threw me off.

But unfortunately that&#39;s where the love ends. The pickup window is in need of serious help. First, there are at least 20 people behind the counter with apparently no one running the show. We waited 20 minutes for a burger, fries and a mango smoothie. The smoothie was up first and sat there and melted while we waited for the burger &amp; fries. The young man assembling burgers was obviously struggling to keep up and no one came to help him out. At least 3 workers stood by watching him and doing nothing. 
Four portillos associates were put ahead of the paying public in line and they did not order before us, but they were collecting their food and lingering at the counter carrying on private conversations with the workers on duty, who weren&#39;t doing their jobs. The paying public shold be served first, because without them, you don&#39;t have a business. This was at non-peak hours on a Sunday afternoon, and the drive up line was nil.

In fact, they have pretty much the worst service record of any Portillo&#39;s I&#39;ve ever visited.

Food coming from the drive-thru is never hot and the order is usually wrong in some way.  

Today the drive-thru line was moving exceptionally slow for 8pm on a Sunday.  When I got up to the window, a few orders behind me were filled, so I got to listen to a manager (Andy) quasi-yelling at someone on the line about what sounded like a miscommunication about croissants.  Pretty off-putting.  

The food-runner outside asked me if I had any ribs or pasta, and I explained that I had two beef sandwiches, fries, and a tamale (quite possibly the easiest order at Portillo&#39;s to fill, in my opinion) and he said &#34;ooooh.... there&#39;s a 8-10 minute wait on tamales.&#34;  Would&#39;ve been nice if someone had mentioned it when I ordered.

He then called the same manager over, who explained that the wait should be &#34;significantly less than that.&#34;

As per usual, food was not hot when I got home, and the dipped beef I ordered was not wrapped in plastic as usual, so it soaked through the bottom of the bag.

Thinning out salad dressing is a big ugly no no and so I am going to make my own. I drive 12 miles there so it seems lazy to not, but it is hard for me to do the prep.
I think they are a very good place, consistent and most of the time dependable. But they rush you at drive thru (no menu except paper) and it feels like they can&#39;t wait to see you go with your diluted salad and no dessert. How come there wasn&#39;t two pieces of cake instead of none? I don&#39;t recall ever being given more. Holiday weekend or not, the public isn&#39;t stupid!!!!!!!!!"

This is not one of them. Their food is top quality, heart stopping amazingness everytime. Beyond that, which is most important, no matter how busy they get, my order has never been wrong. Italian beef, double dipped, mozzarella cheese, hot peppers with liquid cheese to top it off...add onion rings and 2 extra sides of cheese...not once have they screwed this up. Try getting extra mustard at the burger king across the street. Good luck! This is top quality chicago food at its best and the team that gets it to you is just as good."

If the drive thru is really busy I recommend going inside to order. My problem with the drive thru on busy days is that if you have a small order (ex: hot dog, fries and drink) it is likely your food will be delivered to your car before you even turn the first corner of the drive thru lane. Until you get towards the end of the lane there is no way to get around cars ahead of you who are waiting for their larger orders.

Lesson 1. 
Chicago Hot Dogs are Costco Type Hot Dogs, but with fantastic toppings.
Lesson 2. 
Fancy is subjective.
Lesson 3. 
Sloppy, make sure you get plenty of napkins. Don&#39;t kid yourself.
Lesson 4.
This is a drive through. You can have a moment of weakness and order all you want, but don&#39;t. FOR SHAME. 

I was staying out in Wheeling, IL and wanted to try a Chicago Dog. After a yelp search, I was able to find Portillo&#39;s.  The Chicago store had rave reviews, so i figured this location would offer the similar fare.  

Ordered :
Char-Grilled maxwell street style Polish dog for $3.95 
Cake Chocolate shake $2.79.
FATTY STATUS. 

I didn&#39;t think I would eat the whole dog, but I did. It was good, but the bread was super soggy.
The cake shake, meh. Skip it and save the calories. 

Overall, satisfies a craving but keep the heartburn medicine handy."

We stopped for a couple drinks, wings, and nachos. Heather, our bartender was quite obviously less-than-thrilled to be working this evening.  Having worked the service circuit both bartending and serving, I can attest that the salary you make is a reflection upon the service you give. For that reason I hope this bartender has a second job.  

On to the food--the wings never came (after 29 minutes), so we canceled those.

As for the nachos, if you&#39;d like a plate of tortilla chips and shredded lettuce (oh, and five jalape√±o peppers) for just under ten bucks, this is just the place for you. Even after calling the evening &#34;manager&#34;  over (because the bartender was clearly ignoring us), he informed us that they only put 2 oz of chili on the chips. Really? 

The icing on the cake was when we asked another employee for sour cream, and we were still waiting for it after ten minutes. We finally gave up, but then noticed the same employee &#34;making out&#34; with another employee by the corner register. He did apologize for forgetting (after the nachos were taken away to be remade), so I guess he gets the star on this review. 

Needless to say, the second attempt at fixing our nachos was just as bad as the first. We left extremely dissatisfied, still hungry, and $45 down the tubes.

Dining room had families including ours and my granddaughter was upset by some wrestling on several TV&#39;s that showed lots of blood and bleeding men. I noticed other moms shielding their kids faces and several parents were rolling their eyes at each other. I found mgr Nick and politely asked him to change the tv&#39;s due to all the kids. He said he would if no one objected! After 10 minutes no tv was changed, I observed no one watching that sport and kids still being shielded from the tv&#39;s. After I found the mgr and reminded him about the TV&#39;s he snapped at me that I was at a sports bar and they sponsor the MMA and he walked away from me. The people in the dining room were shocked at how he spoke to me and thanked me for asking him to change the channel. A few minutes later all bloody wrestling was removed from the TV&#39;s. Not once did the mgr come into the dining room but the families all thanked our table!
Nick you are a poor manager and if you think young children should have to watch blood and violence while dining on a Sunday afternoon, I feel sorry for you and the establishment you work for! Will never give BWW a penny again!"

We had to wait in line for 35 mins confused on if they were ever going to take out order. I understand they were busy but no one was communicating with us at all. 
There was multiple counters, by the time we got there, the staff just walks away and we stand there awkwardly while the other counter takes orders, so after 15 mins we walk to the other counter. We waited another 10 mins because by the time we got there, the staff just walks away again. Finally a guy comes and was about to take our order, but had to run off for some reason. And then forgot about us so after another 10 mins he comes back and ask if we were picking up, and we said we want to order. After we ordered, he told us there was a 25 min wait, but when it was about 20 mins, they called our name, so we went to the counter, but the staff walked away for another 10-15 mins. Like why call our name our order isn&#39;t ready just to walk away. 
1.5 hours for some wings just doesn&#39;t seem worth it especially with staff who rudely ignored their customers, but were perfectly fine talking with their friends when they see them come."

We were seated after about 5 minutes which was okay. However the dinng area was a little hectic. A large group of high school kids were just leaving. Not sure if the servers were running behind with the checks or something else. Couple tables next to us seemed not so happy about the wait. After 20 minutes of waiting, I would have walked out if my kid didn&#39;t insist to stay. Finally after 10 more minutes of wait, the hostess came and took our order. Another 25 minutes passed without food. Our server never introduced himself and never checked on us. I had to literally flag him down and ask whether or not he&#39;s our server. He confirmed and apologized for the delay (not really sincere). 

The food finally came at the 65-minute mark, and was delivered by the other staff. Our server was chatting away with the other table and his coworkers obviously talking about the earlier large group.

We had a few bites of our food, which was quite tasty. Ingredients were fresh. Meat was cooked perfectly, except the breading was on the heavy side. We had to wrap our food to go because of the time. Our server did a much better job at the end. The food and the last minutes of service (and the hostess&#39;s help) made it to 3 stars."

Haven&#39;t dined in at this one for a while so I can&#39;t comment on that. But last night I placed an order for carry out right before the game. It was a 45 minute wait for the order, which is understandable I suppose on game night. I showed up exactly 45 mins later to pick up, bring the food home, and I&#39;m missing half of my boneless wings. They left out a whole flavor that I had ordered. It&#39;s just frustrating that you take 45 minutes to prepare an order and you STILL can&#39;t get it right. You have the right order on my receipt and you charged me for it, but you couldn&#39;t prepare it correctly? Unacceptable. I couldn&#39;t drive back because I didn&#39;t want to miss any more of the game but I called and spoke to a &#34;temporary manager&#34; whatever that means, he gave me a $10 credit for my next visit. I guess we&#39;ll see if that actually works or not, I have a feeling they&#39;re going to look at me with a blank face when I mention it to them. Also, the fries we got with our order were beyond cold. They honestly tasted like they prepared them right as I placed my order and let them sit for 45 minutes. They were hard, cold, and completely gross. Fries should have been the last item they add to the order. Never ordering from bdubs again.

In my opinion, the wings here at BWW do not hold a candle to the ones at Hooters.  

I ordered the &#39;hot&#39; wings and they were definitely spicy, the sauce itself was good.  I even asked my waitress for additional celery and ranch dressing which she provided at no charge.

However, the wings had no crunch to them (possibly due to being drowned in the sauce) and were dry and chewy.

Well my fiance and I ordered the following:
- Fried pickles
- Buffalo chips w/ queso
- 6 lemon pepper wings
- 6 chipotle bbq wings
- 6 mild
- 6 honey bbq

The fried pickles were heavily breaded, not as good as Hooters. My fiance loves the buffalo chips, though i wasnt impressed. They are thickly sliced potatoes with no seasoning or crunch.

The lemon pepper and chipotle bbq wings were dry rubbed items from their limited time menu. They were not anything special. I like my wings wet and moist. The honey bbq wings were the best as the mild sauce tasted too strong.

The reason for the 2 star is not only due to unimpressive food, but service. Our server Emilie was incrediblely slow. We had to flag her down to give us the check, then she went to another table to chat with people. We waited 15 minutes for her to come back and pick up the check, and she only came because we flagged her down again. Right after she dropped off our receipts, she went right back to talking to the other table. She didnt say one word to us.

Walking out, the guy at the take out window saw that we were carrying 2 boxes of leftovers and asked if we wanted a bag. Something that our terrible waitress should have provided. 

BWW is not worth the cost for the food. I could make better wings for 1/4 of the prices they charge."

Tables next to us left way before us and by the time we were leaving they were still not clean. Discusting, it seems like nobody knows what they&#39;re doing in that place very disappointed and will not be coming back!"

For me, wings are number one and it&#39;s because of Buffalo Wild Wings. I love this place so much that we had our rehearsal dinner specifically at this location, no joke. 

The Hoffman Estates location rocks. The General Manager, Jay, and his staff do an excellent job of maintaining quality and outstanding service. Ask for Melinda, she has been waiting on us for the past couple of years and is phenomenal. It is because of their excellent service in addition to finger lickin&#39; wings that keeps us coming back week after week. 

In terms of the sauces, I alternate between the Caribbean jerk, spicy BBQ, parmesan garlic, and mango habanero. You can ask for your wings to be crispy or saucy depending on how you like them. We often come on Tuesday nights for the $.45 wing deal but can&#39;t help when the craving calls and end up coming on random days of the week. Heads up, this place gets packed on game nights. 

There are other places in the city for wings but for me, they can&#39;t beat Buffalo Wild Wings."

Last night, my sister picked up food for us &#34;to go&#34;.  They checked everything before it was in the bag, and we were good to go.  they got everything correct (which is hard to do in our case, sometimes!) but...

...they forgot napkins and forks.  And we were eating at a place that didn&#39;t have either.  So we had no napkins for our wings (messy city!) and my salad was turned into a finger food.  NOT ATTRACTIVE!

No big deal, so she brought us our drinks.  My fiancee had the original and it was super sour. When I tried it, the lemon taste was way too powerful.  I had ordered the strawberry lime one.

Their signature product is wings, so I thought I&#39;d be rewarded by touring their line of barbecue and hot sauces, but I find their sauces to be completely one dimensional. I haven&#39;t found a BBQ sauce I like. I haven&#39;t liked garlic and parmesan, or any of the creamier sauces.

So... is it because of the sauces, or the wings? Well, after repeated visits, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s the wings -- the boneless ones have too much breading, not enough chicken, occasionally really dry. The bone-in ones are the better choice.

But I&#39;ve settled on the chicken tenders, which also have far too much breading but at least keep the chicken moist, and sometimes, I actually like the crunch. And whatever sauce I&#39;ve had with these has been better.

So it goes. I&#39;ll just get glorified chicken tenders off your menu, and the Asian Zing and Carribean Jerk sauces, in exchange for everyone I work with insisting on coming here most Thursdays in the year."

There&#39;s plenty of parking in the private lot, but getting in the front door was a challenge, even though we were there 45 minutes before the opening tip. 

Thankfully they have a patio area which has an unlocked side door on the east side of the building. If you&#39;re like us and only wanted a seat at the bar and didn&#39;t need to be seated by the host, this was unquestionably the quicker way in. We parked ourselves at the bar without much fuss. The rest of the booths were filling up quickly, as is the case at BWWW&#39;s for major sporting events. 

Our bartender was friendly and attentive, plus he made a very tasty Bloody Mary. It wasn&#39;t as good as a fresh mix from scratch, but not bad from a pre-mix bottle. The turkey burger I had was a little dry, but did come with a healthy portion of fries. 

In all, we enjoyed ourselves (of course, I did more, as the Lakers took home another championship and I won my $100 bet with my buddy), but weren&#39;t blown away either. There&#39;s only a few stalls in the bathroom considering the size of the place, so make sure to pay a visit during a commercial break, as sometimes lines will form."

And the sauces did not taste right either.  Had the Garlic Parmesan and Asian Zing.  Both did not taste right, and made the wings basically inedible.  When I informed the waiter, he said, &#34;there is nothing I can do.&#34;  He then asked if I wanted to talk to a manager.  I told him, it would be nice, but that Management does not seem to care about their customers.  Needless to say, he never brought a manager over to talk to us.  He then asked if we wanted a box to take the wings home.  I informed him, the reason we only ate a few of them was that they were inedible, so why would I want to take them home.  He asked us three more times if we wanted to take them home.   His service poor as well, as he seemed to forget we were there, despite visiting the tables and booths around us numerous times.

I placed an order that was going to be picked up, I was put on hold with no indication. Then a very rude lady picked up and asked for my order. I gave it and at the end she said &#34;It&#39;ll be ready in 10 or something.&#34; and hung up. Picking up the food was a struggle also. We asked for wet naps and extra ranch and received neither.

But I have to give them props, their lunchtime specials (wraps, mini burgers) are pretty good deals and I&#39;ve never had problems with service from 12-1.  It&#39;s only when I go during happy hour -- when everybody and their mother comes here and they never have enough servers.

Other items on the menu are good as well, although I don&#39;t often order anything other than wings. Honorable mention goes to the &#34;flatbreads&#34; which are a pizza like creation with anything but a pizza like topping.

I later found out that it was called flavor dust, and to me, it looked like the base to their sauces.  I asked the waitress for the sauce instead and she brought me another cup of powder.

What ticked me off was that when we pointed out to the girl who served us our order that we have not been given silver ware, she went to a both and chatted up who could have only been her friends and sampled stuff from their plate but never gave us any silverware. 

I had to get up and point out to the supervisor that we were still waiting on silverware. Just not acceptable."

Not knowledgeable, they didn&#39;t know what buffalo sauce was. Walked in to order lunch to find a long line, someone taking orders on phone and a manager and 2 employees trying to resolve errors in a large order and 3 other staff just talking by another register as people were waiting. This place needs customer service training to get these kids to pay attention to those waiting in line. I walked out after trying twice to order waiting."

Took our order. Nachos came fine, then it started. Ran out of soda, she said she&#39;d get one for me and never saw again for a long while. Wings came, but not the kids meals (mac and cheese and mini corn dogs). Waited, and waited, now there are NO servers around to ask. Where are they? Found one and asked, then she said she&#39;d send the manager.
Emily comes and has to RE-TAKE the kids orders. Why didn&#39;t she know what it was? Didn&#39;t she take it down? Clearly not.
Ryan the Manager comes and we explain, the wings are now cold waiting for the kids meals, still waiting on refills. He says he&#39;ll take care of it and adjust the bill too. More waiting. Seriously? It&#39;s mac and cheese and mini corn dogs. I assume they aren&#39;t dipping the corn dogs in batter making it from scratch, so it&#39;s probably something you just heat up, and mac and cheese?
Finally food comes, still short one apple juice for the kids. Ryan says he&#39;ll talk the kids meals off the bill. We eat. She comes back. &#34;Are you all full now? Is everything all fixed?&#34; Who says, &#34;Are you all full now?&#34;
Boxes and the bill. More waiting. Do we pay her or at the register. F it, done waiting. Get the family and pay at register. Now told nobody can ring us up but her. Are you serious?! We just want to get the heck out of here. Please! About 5 workers standing in awe and NONE can help. All just looking confused. No initiative, like there is some secret code that only she can enter in the register that will allow us to be released from being held captive there. I say, please, can you just get Ryan and have him take care of this so we can leave already. She shows up and rings us out. No tip. Were you seriously expecting one? Should anyone after being treated like that?
FIRST time eating in, last time too. Ordered take out before and seriously, it&#39;s hit or miss that they get the order right. Love the wings, hate the service, both take out and now for sure sit in. Sorry, nothing personal, this is just the truth about the experience and oops social media makes it possible to tell others so they are aware and can make their own choice about it too.
Last things: she never brought the extra coloring sheets she said she would for the kids and the audio was of an interview on 20/20. Why not of any of the dozens of other sports going on? No, instead there is a blaring interview or something on 20/20 as the audio. Totally weird place I tell ya!"

We got a table right away, no waiting!!  We first ordered the roasted garlic mushrooms which were fried in batter.  Well, when the order arrived, there was about 18 tiny pieces, pieces! , not whole mushrooms.  If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d say the server spilt 1/2 the order on the way to deliver them to us!  I had to pull apart the batter to make sure it was really a mushroom and if anything was in there, all for $5.79, skip it as you skip this place.  Of the 6 wing order, 5 were very very dry on the outside, one had a semblance of juice.  I ordered 2 sauces, so the wings came dry.  Both sauces, the spicy garlic and med bbq had similar heat and it was hard to tell the difference.  The chicken wraps were average, but you can do much much better elsewhere.  It was noisy, tvs wall to wall and full of yelling kids.  If you enjoy this environment, this is the place for you!  Cant believe people go here, kids don&#39;t know any better, but families??  May be ok during a football game or something tho."

The atmosphere is very crowded and not somewhere I&#39;d call clean.  Even when the place is empty late at night, there are so many tables packed into the seating area that it seems difficult to walk through the place.  Music is really loud, but they usually turn it down (or maybe off?) when a premier game is on.

I&#39;d stopped in for a beer at the bar several times before I actually ate in the restaurant, but I&#39;m glad I finally tried the food.  While the tap selection is decently large (Fat Tire, etc), the hot sauce selection was the most impressive thing for me.  The wings were really excellent, I tried three varieties including the Habanero Mango.  I&#39;m curious to taste the hottest sauce on the menu, because the Habanero (third to hottest) didn&#39;t really heat me up like actual habanero salsas -- but it was still delicious.

I could imagine service being a disaster here because the table layout feels so unorganized, but our server was attentive.  Wings come in cardboard bowl/plates, which is fine for me but figured that it should be mentioned.  Regardless, the wings were great and the beer selection is large enough to keep me coming back."

Service is just ok, what do you expect from a wings joint? Yes, servers are mostly dudes. Go to Hooters if you expect your server to be a chick. 

Wings are decent, beer is good. I like the naked tenders wrap and variety of sauces. I agree it&#39;s a drive from Woodfield, but it&#39;s also far from the assholes who&#39;ve been shopping at Woodfield all day. 

Gets crazy loud on sports-events night (especially cubs and illini games), but I like the NTN trivia and boneless wings nights. Wings come in paper containers, wipes at the table for your fingers. Sauces, celery, and extra dips are extra. (Like the 40 cents will kill you.) 

Decent beer, food, and NTN. Go in expecting it to be a super snazzy place, you will be disappointed. But if you have realistic expectations, you should be ok. 

They also do carry out. Bonus!"

Hot BBQ was much better than spicy garlic, which had almsot no flavor at all, just salt and grease.  The &#34;blue cheese&#34; dressign comes out of a bottle in the back and is made in a factory and it tastes like teh factory.  they dont make it on site like Hooters and it shows.  No flavor and littel microdots of &#34;cheese&#34;.  It was more like mayonaise than anything.  This is supposed to be what they are known for and it is not  even worth mentioning except for the fact that it is not good.  

Its loud.  I know its a sports bar, but it seemed over loud with the music and all the tv&#39;s.  Lots of overweight people eating here is not a particularlly good sign, either.  If you are under 21 this might be your place in the burbs, but you can do better if you want wings almost anywhere that offers them would do better than this Disneyland of lame.  Beer list is for people who do not appreciate good beer.  Guinness is the mots flavorful thing they offer.  I got the Weiss beer and it tasted old and flat.    Do yourself a favor and the rest of the world and do not support this half-assed attempt at making chicken wings a family affair.  I will never go back to one of these ever again."

Our second experience we decided to order online since you can get free delivery if you order online. After an hour of waiting they called and we&#39;re extremely apologetic saying that their online system was having a problem and they had just received our order. We were a little miffed but they assured us they would get to us as quickly as possible. Before we knew it, the food was at our door and they COMPED our ENTIRE meal!! I was shocked!! The delivery driver was extremely nice and wouldn&#39;t even accept a tip. I was so pleased with how they handled the situation. And to top it off the food was absolutely delicious.

This is my first and absolute last time ordering from here. I placed an order on GrubHub and the food came relatively quickly. I ordered fries, a calzone, and cake. The ONLY positive about this place is they give you a ton of food for the price. The downside to that is the food is complete garbage. Soggy fries (and some were cold...  how on earth does that even happen), no seasoning on the calzone, and the cake tasted like it was from a vending machine. Keep in mind I&#39;m a college student so I&#39;m not usually picky about places to eat but holy crap the food was awful. 

The BIGGEST TURN OFF about this place is the customer service. When my food was delivered the driver stacked all my food on my arm and then held his hand out. I was so confused so we spent a good 10 seconds just awkwardly staring at each other. I proceeded to tell him I ordered on grub hub. He told me he wasn&#39;t waiting for cash he was waiting for his tip.... UM WHAT!?? I told him I left a tip on grub hub and even attempted to show him the receipt on my phone but he showed me the paper receipt first which I will admit didn&#39;t show a tip. At that point I was thinking this creep doesn&#39;t deserve a tip (he was an older guy in his 40s probably so I assumed he needed the cash) but I tried to hand him the food back and told him I had some cash and I&#39;d give him the tip but this arrogant SOB told me he doesn&#39;t need my tip, literally yelled at me about absolutely nothing (I promise you this is not an exaggeration), and rolled his eyes at like 5 times it was unreal. 

I ended up just muttering something admittedly rude under my breath and closed the door because I was getting so incredibly mad I couldn&#39;t deal. 

This is the first time in my entire life I actually had to call a restaurant to complain (this did NOTHING!). How dare you hold your hand out at me, yell at me, and try to come for my character. I leave tips NO MATTER WHAT. I have so many friends who work in restaurants I know it&#39;s in poor taste to not leave tips. There is not a single instance when I have gone out to eat, nail salon, ect and not left a tip.

All in all the customer service is atrocious and the food is not good enough to make it worth it. 

Save your money :)"

The pizza was average. The slice was large enough that it was served sliced in half. It was served very hot.
I enjoyed it as the sauce  was not over powered with seasoning. 
The fries that came with it were absolutly horrid.
The fry oil was old and the fries looked and tasted bad.
I would try the pizza again,just the pizza.

This is the second time we ordered from here but our first time eating. The first time we ordered we finally gave up after 2 hours and made grilled cheese. They blamed grub hub but spoke to grub hub and they said they had no issues. Gave the benefit of the doubt and tried again this time directly from them. Since the girl on the phone couldn&#39;t make a recommendation on which of their 2 types of pizza was better we ordered 1 thin and one traditional. After about 75 minutes called and asked what&#39;s up ? Was told  &#34;oh didn&#39;t I call you? I thought I did they messed up and made 2 thins so we remade the whole order and it&#39;s on it&#39;s way. When it arrive 25 minutes later ( we live 10 minutes away) you could tell they didn&#39;t remake the thin it was dried out and over cooked so they must have left it warming all that time. It was terrible the traditional was better because it wasn&#39;t dried out but not very good. Plus they must use a ton of salt because I woke up twice that night to guzzle big glasses of water which I never do. Oh well no 3rd try for this place

Pizza slice, incredible!!!!! Hot, fresh, full of flavor. Reheated it was still great. 5 bucks with a drink, and I think a dollar more to add fries. The slice is cut in half and I can see why. Ordered for our Arlington Heights office last week, and will definitely be ordering for our office again. Tasty wings, (boneless actually were better than the first time), was told of a slight change. Garlic parmesian, honey bbq, or plain old hot wings. Tough chioce.

I was expecting a little container but it&#39;s a pretty generous portion! The wings, well, they were good, but I can&#39;t eat them without a dipping sauce. Yes, they never sent the ranch. I thought maybe I confused myself when ordering since I did it online, but when I checked the email they sent me to confirm my order, it was there in capital letters.

The veggies tasted old and stale. The chicken doesn&#39;t seem to be on the level of chipotle freshness. Doesn&#39;t seem worth it, to pay $8 for this stuff. Skip this place and go to the Chipotle next door, unless they decide to amp up the freshness of their ingredients"

You can order off the menu or a la cart, same concept as Subway.
The staff is hit or miss. Sometimes you get someone really personable and happy to help but sometimes you get someone that clearly doesn&#39;t want to be there. It&#39;s a fast food place so I guess I can deal with bad service since it isn&#39;t for too long. 
Their queso is my favorite around, goes good on everything and you can get it in three different sizes that includes a bag of chips (you also get chips free with every entree.) Fresh salsa bar is great and they have cups so you can take it to go. They have a cucumber salsa that&#39;s pretty good and different out right now. 
If you enter your phone number at check out you get to redeem points after a certain number of check ins. I earned a free entree today so I was happy!

Over the past few years they have been sprouting up in IL.  The first location I ate in IL was in Northbrook/Glenview area, which I believe has since closed.

Hoffman Estates Location:
When I walked in an employee was making a sandwich for herself.  Silly me I thought she was making a torta.  I got all excited and asked if that was on the menu.  Was told that it was not.  Then noticed from the wrapper the sandwich was from Jimmy Johns.  So she brought over a sandwich from JJ and was topping it off on the food prep line?  Shouldn&#39;t that be forbidden by mgmt? If not, then at least not done in front of customers.

The protein line up looked overcooked and dry beyond belief, but I was running late and figured to go with the chicken.  On a positive note, they offer a lot more topping options than a Chipotle, Baja or Qdoba. On a negative, they do not warm up the tortilla.

The burrito was decent, mostly due to the grilled onions and mushrooms, but chicken was dry.  I also liked the salsa bar and small side of chips that come with every meal.

They offer a meal option(drink and side) for a few $&#39;s, but my side of guac looked gray and not a nice green hue one would find in a Chipotle.  They probably prep it way in advance and that completely ruins the taste.

This location has TVs on the wall and the salsa bar is a big plus, but overall the food is not on par with Chipotle and Qdoba."

Actually, maybe Moe&#39;s preceded Chipotle, who knows? They have similarities, but Moe&#39;s has several positives going for it;

The free chips and salsa bar are most awesome.  Both items are high quality and very tasty.

The seating is ample and comfortable, and there are several big screens to attract the attention of the lonesome business diner.

The food is pretty good.  I wasn&#39;t a fan of the soggy shredded chicken that is scooped out of a non-temperature controlled bin and flopped on to your taco, but the pork had an excellent fresh, porky flavor (almost bacony, which is of course fabulous).

I&#39;m sure that I will dine here again, I just won&#39;t order the chicken taco."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Chipotle and their efforts to bring sustainable and fresh meat to the masses are awesome, but Moe&#39;s just goes a few steps further. And I can&#39;t complain when food of that quality is being sold to me for under $10.

The set up of Moe&#39;s is much like Chipotle - start ordering at one end of a line, move down selecting ingredients along the way and end at the cashier. The menu at Moe&#39;s is a little humorous with a burrito named after George Costanza&#39;s alter-ego Art Vandalay, but includes burritos, quesadillas, fajitas, and salads all with your choice of chicken, beef, steak, pork, tofu or veggie. I liked the toppings they had available as well which included fresh jalapenos. Needless to say the options are endless. 

The best part for me however, was the free salsa. I had ordered a salad without the shell and no salad dressing which meant that I could have as much salsa on my salad as I wanted. This made me and my low-carb self happy.

Let me make this clear, Moe&#39;s is not Chipotle, but it is still good - especially if you have dietary concerns such as eating gluten-free or just really like customizing your Mexican food."

The salsa bar is pretty good... not &#34;fresh salsa made with backyard tomatoes&#34; good, but still good and flavorful. Everything else they sell is a step down from that.

Today I tried the buffalo chicken nachos. The first thing I thought as they piled ingredients atop a pile of nachos was &#34;I must&#39;ve picked the unhealthiest item on the menu&#34;. Still, I was hoping for a good alternative to Qdoba&#39;s ancho BBQ-drenched chips.

In short... no. The buffalo sauce was pretty one-dimensional, and the other ingredients didn&#39;t exactly step up to the plate. The chicken tasted strange, perhaps a little dry but that&#39;s hard to say when it&#39;s covered in sour cream and tomato salsa. Their other meats are better.

All meals come with chips, and the salsa bar is great fun with over 5 salsas to choose from. Servers are always friendly - greeting you as you walk in like you&#39;re at a Cold Stone or something. With my obvious love for the place, the reasons I don&#39;t give a 5 is the general cost being slightly high and inconsistent. Sometimes I order food that supposedly come with guacamole, but since I don&#39;t ask, it&#39;s not on there, and then am I paying for it? I&#39;m not sure, but you&#39;ll be safe on Moe Monday."

Time of my visit: Lunch

Well, I was not sure what I was in the mood for, so I went to Yelp! for help.  After looking around, I figured I&#39;d have some a burger for lunch.  So off I went to this joint!

If you have never been to this joint before, it&#39;s a bit hard to figure out where the entrance to the restaurant is.  Originally, I entered through the bar below the actual restaurant, but quickly realized I needed to go up.

Once I found the place, I was seated quickly.  I was surprised the place was pretty full.  There were at least two parties with dozen or so people each, as well as a bunch of people having business lunches.  I was impressed by that fact.

The waitress was hustling, but made her way to my table.  I asked for water and up on receiving it, I asked for recommendations.  She suggested I tried their appetizers, they were 1/2 off (I am going to go ahead and assume it&#39;s a Monday thing), except for wings and she told me they were famous for their burgers.  The second she said that, I was sold!  I ordered BBQ Burger, medium rare, gotta have some blood dripping from my burger, gotta keep the bones strong with that iron!

As I was sitting waiting for my food, the one thing impressed me the most was how hard the waitresses were working.  There has not been a single time, they were not juggling multiple things at once.  As impressive as it was, the consequences of that can manifest into shift of priorities based on party size.

My food came out and I thought the portion was pretty decent.  I usually devour my fries first.  I thought the fries were above average, very good.  I wish I could have gotten a side of BBQ sauce (read on as to why) to dip them into.

I normally cut my burger in half, makes it easier to handle and eat.  Especially, if you have to go back to work, like I did, minimizes chance of getting food all over myself.  As I cut my burger, I noticed it was not medium rare.  With my luck, my waitress was right there and she immediately, without hesitation, offered to remake the burger.  Normally, I would have the kitchen remake it, but I was pressed for time, so I kindly declined.  The burger itself was pretty good, the BBQ sauce was by far one the best I have ever tasted!

Time for the check came.  My waitresses brought it over, apologized one more time about the burger and told me some money were take off my bill.  This is the kind of service a lot of places are lacking out days.

B+!  I highly recommend this place!  Good food, excellent service.  I will definitely be back!"

My husband and I met some friends and their kids here for dinner. My husband and I had I only been here once before. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my husband had the fried chicken. My wrap was good size and the side salad I had was good, although not exemplary. My husband&#39;s chicken entree was huge and he raved about the vegetable side (also huge). The food was reasonably priced and the patio we sat on was very nice. I recommend this place for a good, reasonably priced meal!"

Roosters is my neighborhood Cheers bar! I always feel welcome and their beer selection and specials are always a plus. I&#39;ve been here some many times, not sure why I haven&#39;t Yelp reviewed it earlier? Maybe I just wanted to keep this little gem spot all to myself...how many neighborhood bars in the area where you can get great food, super service and one of thee best bloody Mary&#39;s from my favorite bartenders Rhonda? I have had a great service experience from all the staff, but Rhonda really goes above and beyond...after only my second time there...she remembered me and just how I like my Bloody Mary...not bland, not super spicy but just a whisper of kick :) I think Knowing your customers and taking care of them is Rhonda&#39;s superhero powers.

It was too hot to sit outside so we went in. We didn&#39;t realize there was an upstairs since the hostess stand is upstairs as well. We sat in the bar and it was super noisy. My boyfriend decided to look around and found the stairway, so we immediately relocated. It was loud upstairs, but nowhere near the volume of the downstairs bar. The upstairs is cutely decorated. We were seated immediately and got a very cranky waitress. She was horrible the entire experience. She made us feel like we were inconveniencing her to be there. The food was mediocre as best. Probably not a place we will return to in the near future."

And I&#39;m so sad because this has been my favorite restaurant for over 10 years. 
We decided to sit in the bar and I think that was the worst decision. Randa in the bar is the most difficult, unprofessional, loud, messy, rude bartender I have ever met. And I use to be a bartender manager! She was taking shots by the register. She was loud, so loud that it made it apparent she was drunk. When I got my second beer she gave me a green line instead of 312 so I told her and she got pissy, and told me I had a green line the first time and charged me for it still.... Her shorts were falling off because they were unbuttoned and unzipped. She rushed us to pay because was leaving. She was yelling at the top of her lungs to other employees that weren&#39;t even in the room. She was clearly over serving all of the customers. If it wasn&#39;t for I think Kristy we would not have left a tip. She was serving outside yet she took our order, got our drinks (minus 2), got extra sauce when we asked... She did everything. I&#39;m so angry they split tips because Randa didn&#39;t deserve $.01. Whoever came in to relief Randa was more helpful in those 5 minutes than she was the whole time. Our check was $45+ but with how stressful that experience was, not being able to actually enjoy our food, and having to deal with her... It should have been free. It was so bad. We will not be going back unless she is fired. It was THAT bad! I called and tried to speak with a manager right when we left but the manager is apparently gone for another week...?"

The chicken sandwiches are by far the best anywhere, especially if you get the Cajun chicken sandwich. A little pricey but the size of the chicken breast they use is well worth it.

I don&#39;t know, what do you want for lunch? That&#39;s me and my boyfriends favorite song, lol. We were singing it last week trying to decide what to get. I turn to Yelp like always and we started driving. I picked this place because of the decent reviews but also because it&#39;s in a barn, I had to see it. 
We came in through the downstairs entrance which is where the bar is. The bar has lots of high top seating and for a Wednesday afternoon (1 pm) it was busy down there. I didn&#39;t want to sit at the bar so we walked upstairs to the dining area. It was a space with high ceilings and very bright. I liked the decor, simple but cute. There&#39;s old photos of the area from the early 1900s which I liked. 
They have a pretty big selection in their menu. I went with the roast beef sandwich and fries. My boyfriend had the grilled cheese with bacon and avocado. 
I know that being hungry had a lot to do with it but I can&#39;t remember the last time I had a sandwich that I enjoyed so much. My sandwich had plenty of thinly sliced roast beef with saut√©ed peppers and onions served on French bread with a lot of melted mozzarella cheese on top. OMG was this sandwich delicious!!! I only ate half while I was there and took the other half home. The fries were good too, not greasy. 
I was being nosy and looking around to see what others were eating and the Mac and cheese and fried chicken caught my eye. I also wished that I had ordered the black beans and rice that was served with pico de gallo on top. 
I also noticed they have a cute patio area. 
I can&#39;t wait to come back and try that fried chicken."

I have had the fried chicken dinner, the macaroni and cheese, and the pot roast dinner. All meals were a great value and tasted delicious! They were very heavy given that it is comfort food. They are probably known best for their chicken, so I would get at least something with chicken in it. 

My only complaint is their inconsistency in service. Some times the service can be really slow. 

If you&#39;re going out for bar food or just to hang out with friends and drink, this is a great local spot!"

It was really good and perfectly crispy without a lot of heavy breading so it didn&#39;t seem greasy.  Our meal came with your choice of potato and either soup or salad. The Hubs had the Cream of Broccoli soup (soup of the day) and he said it tasted homemade with lot of fresh chopped/cooked broccoli in it. I had the Chicken Tortilla soup, which was more like a Southwest-style Cream of Chicken soup &amp; not like other tortilla soups I&#39;ve had, but it was still very good. The garlic mashed potatoes were also good but it doesn&#39;t come with gravy, which would have been nice. I would have also liked it the meal came with some sort of veggie, but it was a good price at $13 for half a fried chicken dinner. 

The place looks nice with a big patio area and a bar downstairs and the service was attentive so I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back."

The sourdough bread is a nice addition instead of the traditional english muffin. The fish fry is FAN-F&#39;in-tastic!

I overall enjoy the ambiance of this barn\restaurant. The owner is thoughtful and takes pride in her establishment. 

There&#39;s also a downstairs bar\lounge to eat\drink, a patio for the summer nights\mornings and a zillion Hot Sauce options, the heat can get intense!

My menu had crumbs stuck inside the plastic and there&#39;s a bunch of misspellings in the menu itself. They have some awesome stuff, like their fish and pot roast, but I feel like they&#39;re using less than quality ingredients for other things. My pot roast sandwich today came with a horseradish sauce that basically was sour cream with a hint of flavor. My fries tasted like they were fried in old oil, and my mac and cheese had a weird taste to it, like the noodles sat in water or something for too long. 

Physically, the place could use an update. Dirty windows, things are definitely losing their shine, and it isn&#39;t in a charming way. It&#39;s a bummer that it seems to be going downhill, as it used to be pretty awesome."

I asked the waitress if they are allowed to smoke and she looked around and said yes.  Not sure what the law is about smoking outside at a restaurant on the patio, it was very unsettling. Other customers were yelling at their kids. I understand disciplining kids because I have 2 of my own, but it was more than that.  Not the kind of atmosphere I would expect at a restaurant.  We ordered the fried chicken and the chicken kabobs which the waitress recommended.

We found a coupon on their website for buy 1 breakfast get 1 free. The coupon stated that it must be presented at time of order. I tried to print it before I left the house but had an error with my printer. So I figured I would just show it to the server on my phone. The server told us that it had to be printed so we couldn&#39;t use it. My husband asked for the manager who proceeded to tell us the same thing. 

To us, this seemed like terrible customer service because it didn&#39;t state on the coupon that it must be printed. In the age of smart phones this seems like kind of a ridiculous policy. Not to mention that isn&#39;t the customer always right? They should have told us to please print it next time but they would honor it today. But nope, wouldn&#39;t let us use it at all. The manager also told us we were the third party today who came in with the coupon on their phone. Well, duh, doesn&#39;t that tell you to make a customer service decision and honor the stupid coupon?"

Can someone put in a decent place with a nice patio, good specials and hard cider on tap...PLEASE??

But I digress...

The building looks like a barn and is done up like it&#39;s an old country hotel, with old pictures of Bloomingdale all around.  Upstairs are windows all around and it&#39;s not bad.  Downstairs in the bar feels pretty dark and dank.  The patio is nice enough.

The food is okay but so far nothing has made ANY of us sit up and say &#34;Mmmm!&#34;  Various breakfasts, salads...nachos...sandwiches....  All okay but nothing special.  I thought last week I&#39;d hit on an undiscovered gem:  Veggie Crepes.  Alas, no.  They put sweet whipped cream on them!  &#34;We put whipped cream on all of our crepes!&#34;  Uh...no.  No you don&#39;t.  Not savory crepes.  They removed it but that error prepared me for what were some seriously uninteresting crepes.

Service is fine.  The place has been here long enough, obviously it has its fans.  Seems to be an older crowd.  Nonetheless, I&#39;ll be moving on as soon as I find some place more to my liking."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, it isn&#39;t awful, it&#39;s just... I don&#39;t know, not really worth it so as to make it worth going to even semi-frequently. For the quality of food, it is a bit on the over priced side (most meals are $10+, including appetizers), the waitresses need better outfits (seriously, this isn&#39;t Jr. High, take off the PINK tank top), and the quality of the food is hit or miss.
    First time going back I got a Buffalo Chicken Wrap. It wasn&#39;t bad, no complaints really, fries are rather meh/soggy. Second time back I got a Dijon Pecan Salad-- it could&#39;ve been good, but the flavor was off, too heavy on the Dijon dressing which was quite sweet and clung to the mass amounts of ingredients except the salad. There seem to be various drink specials depending on the day, Tuesdays (which it was for both my past visits) are half off bottles of wine and something to do with Jack.... The rest of my party&#39;s meal feedback was similar to mine: some ok, others meh. There are some lunch specials, which seems to hover around $7.50.
    The atmosphere of the place is ok, not too surprising because of the name, it looks like a barn. Inside is fine, but the patio is enjoyable. Only slight complaint I heard once was the noise from traffic, but it wasn&#39;t so irksome that it&#39;d put me off, the patio is good. Also, free Wi-Fi.
    Service itself is good. Attentive waitresses both times who made sure to check up on us frequently as appropriate, and never forgot to grab anything we requested. Didn&#39;t even get snarky when we sat long after we finished our meals!
    I don&#39;t think Rooster&#39;s is terrible, but personally I don&#39;t find it worth making my regular Tuesday lunch place (we go for lunch every Tuesday, and our usual place recently closed). We gave it a shot, we know what it has to offer for future reference, but for our regular place we shall keep looking."

Yes this is in a cute little barn and they have a nice outdoor area. We came in on Fathers Day and only had about a ten minute wait for a table. 

Once we got to our table out waitress came right over. My dad got a bloody, I got a mimosa and I asked for some water for the both of us. &#34;Of course, that&#39;s coming out.&#34;


5 minutes, no drinks. 10 minutes, nothing. Finally my mimosa comes out. No water or bloody. My dad asks for a coffee in the meantime while he&#39;s waiting for his drink from the bar. 15 minutes later, still nothing. Finally, the waitress brings out all the drinks at once. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an excuse for no water for that long. There&#39;s not a lot of tables in the place and I think there were enough waitresses to have it covered.

My dad enjoyed his omelette. I usually get something savory but I went with stuffed French toast for a change. It wasn&#39;t stuffed so much as it had a cream cheese smear with strawberries. The whipped cream may have been coconut but it was a strange translucent shade of white and just looked unappetizing. I don&#39;t like whipped cream in the first place so this quickly got moved to the side of my plate. I didn&#39;t have much of an appetite and the French toast was a little soggy on a few pieces. I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again.

Overall, the drinks issue was enough to keep me not coming back for breakfast. Maybe another meal of the day, we will see."

This is the kind of place you want to like so bad but it&#39;s now clear to me why you never have to wait for a table when you come here. 

The service the last 2 times we have been here was mediocre, at best. The most recent visit, we went with my sister and brother in law the day after getting home from our of town and had nothing in the fridge to eat, so out for brunch we went. I typically order lunch foods for breakfast at most places because most restaurants serve too large of portions for breakfast foods that can&#39;t be reheated, so I will usually skip right to the lunch foods. I learned right away they don&#39;t have lunch until 11 am so I was screwed right from the start. 

I asked the server if they have egg beaters and she informed me they do. Then I asked her if they were egg beaters brand or another brand. Yes, I&#39;m a freak of nature and can tell the difference. I&#39;m not a fan of any of the so-called egg beaters on the market except egg beaters themselves. Hell, we actually hold a membership at Sams Club based solely on the fact that they specifically sell the egg beaters brand eggs and Costco does not. So she wasnt sure if they are egg beaters or not so she went to ask a manager. From the body language, it appeared that they told her they &#34;weren&#39;t sure either but tell her (me) yes, they are&#34;. I knew then that I wasn&#39;t ordering them. I&#39;ll suffer through regular eggs. 

I ordered a skillet, as did my hubs, my sister got a meal of all different items and shared with her hubs who ordered biscuits and gravy. I have to point out that their menu listed green peppers as an option for my build your own skillet and I asked of they had red peppers too, she firmly told me with confidence they did not have red peppers, they only have green. Wait for it. 

First, my brother-in-law&#39;s eggs were served cold. Not warm...COLD. they had to be remade. 

Second, my husband&#39;s and my meals did not come out with theirs. We ask the server and she explains that because we have separate checks, the meals will be prepared separately. Hey, chef, these two checks are at the same table, can u make sure they all come out at the same time?

See? How hard was that? 

Our meals were served about 5-10 minutes apart. :(

My husband enjoyed his meal. Then again we were starving. They make their corned beef hash in house. I did not find my skillet to be appealing. The potatoes, veggies and cheese were all at the bottom and the eggs placed on top as an after thought (or so it appeared). The cheese was scarce, the eggs were well done which is exactly how I like them but what were all these red things in my skillet??? Oh, what do you know? RED PEPPERS! 

I would have gladly waited 40 minutes for a table at brunch cafe down Lake street. I&#39;ll make a mental note."

and we are totally Rooster&#39;s regulars. Ha ha ha!  

I thought if circle back and fill you in on some favorites. My hubby loves the BLT, the biscuits and gravy, their home fries and the service. Right until the end...sometimes it&#39;s hard to catch the server at the end to pay the bill. I&#39;m a fan of the Cajun salmon on a pretzel roll (instead of the onion roll). I enjoy the fresh cut French fries and the chipotle mayo that I always get on the side. We are big fans of the AYCE fish fry. And everyone we bring for the fish fry has sang their praises as well. Finally, I really enjoy their chocolate chip pancakes. Saturday and Sunday breakfast runs a little later here which is nice. 

As long as things stay on this track, we&#39;ll keep on coming back."

I really like the rustic feel of Roosters. I think that the rustic environment matches the long list of comfort items on the menu. During both visits I had the pleasure of eating outside in the patio area and getting some fresh air while enjoying my meal. During my last visit I had their famous fried chicken meal. I was very impressed with it and was amazed of how perfectly fried it was. The fried chicken takes a little longer than some of the other meals, but it is worth the wait. Due to the fact that the four pieces comes with two sides and a salad/soup, this meal would be suitable to share between two people. One of my other friends had the Greek chicken, and that was delicious as well. The service I received here was fine both times, but one of those times was during lunch time, and the other during a Tuesday evening. I look forward to coming to Roosters again."

It literally looks like a big barn of a restaurant. I normally don&#39;t go here but I&#39;ve been here about 4 times over the years which should be enough. I&#39;ve had the:

Corned beef hash: Literally just chunks of corned beef and potatoes. No onions, peppers or anything else. Not very flavorful. 

Fried chicken: Half a chicken that has been fried crunchy and crispy. It was juicy but the chicken had no taste. Needs a lot of salt and pepper. 

Fried Shrimp: Giant shrimp, fantastic. 

Mashed potatoes and gravy: Lumpy mashed potatoes paired with lumpy gravy. 

Vegetables: The best thing they do here. Grilled soft with visible grill marks. 

Drinks: Has red cream soda which I appreciate. 

Atmosphere: Dark, tall ceiling, neat decor. 

Staff: mostly friend but gives me a weird look once in a while when I walk in.

Prices: Good. Nothing is expensive. 

This place has a lot of hits and misses. Overall I&#39;m not that big of a fan but I know a few in the neighborhood who are."

Next to it is a Silo which gives you the perfect country breakfast aesthetic. There&#39;s a nice kitsch farm theme here, It&#39;s the kind of place where you might expect that if you ask for a glass of milk with your breakfast and then they get it straight from the cow. This kind of atmosphere makes it the perfect place to put a restaurant that serves breakfast food.

I arrived right when they opened one morning and decided to head in. The downstairs appears to be the bar part, and the upstairs the dining area. I haven&#39;t been downstairs to comment but the upstairs had super high ceilings, photos everywhere and a good amount of charm to the interior. After looking over the menu I settled on a &#34;Meat lovers skillet&#34;. With the skillet there was an option of toast or an English muffin, I went with the muffin. 

I placed my order and around 10 minutes later my food was ready. First off there was a lot of fluffy egg right on the top. The amount of meat and cheese was generous and whatever oils and seasoning they used gave it a a very nice flavor. Finally they did a very good job making crispy potato at the bottom of the skillet. Overall I was quite impressed. I made a sandwich from the contents of the skillet and the English muffin. Overall I was quite happy with my food.

So was this farm themed eatery a five star restaurant? Well hold your horses and don&#39;t count your chickens before they hatch, otherwise you might have a cow when I tell you this, but in just two shakes of a lambs tail I can think of better skillets that I&#39;ve had at quite a few other places. Additionally, I prefer pancakes to toast/english muffin as an extra offered with my skillets and that&#39;s no bull. While my food was eggcellent and you can make a pig of yourself with the generous portions. It&#39;s definitely worth chicken out (okay enough with the farm animal puns, I feel sheepish for using as many as I did).  I think four stars is more deserving. The place has a nice atmosphere, friendly service and good food. I can&#39;t comment on the bar or dinner food as I&#39;ve only been here once in the morning, but I would come again and cock-a-doodle do recommend it. So four stars for Roosters Barn and Grill."

We were only in the upstairs part so i can&#39;t vouch for the bar. Bloody marys were tasty, but nothing crazy good.

I had the heart to heart scramble, scrambled eggs with celery, bell peppers, onion, mushroom, and zucchini with a side of fruit and sliced tomato. Went awesome with the side order of bacon i also got because that&#39;s how i roll. My daughter had plain pancakes, they were nice big and fluffy, the men ordered biscuits and gravy, which i also ate some of because my heart healthy egg scramble nullified anything bad i also ate for breakfast, according to me.

I didn&#39;t expect it to be swinging, but wasn&#39;t expecting that .  Maybe most of the &#34;young folk&#34; just go here for breakfast.

There&#39;s nothing fabulous about the dining room here.  It&#39;s a big room, you can see everyone in it.  I called ahead since we are a party of 6, but we could have been seated right away if we just walked in.

I figured this place would have nice size servings and it was close, so we ventured out.  I have 4 boys and 3 are in high school, so we need a place that serves massive quantities or at least has free soda refills.  A few of them ordered the burgers, I had fish tacos, hubby had a fajita and the only one on the kids menu had chicken fingers.  They listed chicken as a special, so one of the boys ordered it - country fried chicken.

Did you know that country fried chicken is a chicken cutlet with gravy over it?  We did not.  We knew that country fried steak or chicken steak was like that, but not this name.  Needless to say, son #3 was not happy when this arrived.  Our server was fantastic about it.  She worked to remedy the situation and said that they have had several problems with the name of the special and people being confused.

All of our food was hot and fresh and tasty.  Our meal took longer than anticipated since we had to wait for something for son #3 to eat.  They did not charge us for the second meal and were falling all over themselves to correct it.

Not a bad experience, but it could have been better.  Our server really tried."

The food is always fresh and service is spot on. It has a true family restaurant feel but also a grownup atmosphere. It&#39;s traditional without being kitschy.

Their Cajun With A Twist sandwich is really good. The chicken breast is large and well seasoned, the toppings are fresh and the chipotle mayo has a nice zing to it. A side of fresh cut fries with sea salt goes along nicely with the meal.

Without a doubt, the star of the show here is the Beer-Battered Haddock Fish Fry. It&#39;s rather pricey compared to other all-you-can-eat fish, but it&#39;s totally worth it. It&#39;s easily my favorite Fish Fry of all time. I think you can order one serving by itself most days of the week, but the unlimited fish is Wednesdays and Fridays.

They&#39;ve offered a couple deals through LivingSocial, which keep bringing us back for lunch. You can use them anytime as long as it&#39;s dine-in, but they aren&#39;t good for the AYCE Fish Fry. The regular Fish Fry with a couple pieces of fish is more than enough for a single meal, though."

The waitress brought out crab legs at the very end of our meal when we were already full. We wondered if they forgot about the crab legs.  I am a huge crab lover and these were by far the worst crab legs I have ever been served. Two steps down from grocery store crab. There was not enough meat to dip into the butter.  They were over cooked. They did end up discounting the legs however we will not be back. The chicken tortilla soup was good.

Tried the fish tacos which I thought were a little spicy. My hubby had the sandwich trio, mini cheeseburger, mini fish, and mini bbq pork. He said it was good.

A plus is that you get to draw on the table clothes with crayon.

Service wasnt great but it wasnt bad either.

One downside, they have small straws for drinks."

I would highly recommend not going on a Friday or weekend but in my book those are the days to go, so a restaurant is useless if they can&#39;t be effective then. Its a shame because there fish is some of the best I&#39;ve ever had in my life, with fries similar to gene and judes and they even have a, cajun battered shrimp, plus a great bar downstairs.  We had a great experience the first time we went on a Wednesday with a waitress named Tina. She was very friendly,  always kept food and drinks coming. She also recommended an awesome bread pudding that night.  But our second encounter we had a different waitress that was barely there and we were asked if we wanted more fish 20 minutes later and drinks 30 minutes later when our glasses were bone dry. By that time we asked for pitchers and I drank an entire pitcher in 10 minutes because I was so thirsty. Then she kept ignoring our table even after that and we waited forever for the check. Had we been waited on better we would have ordered dessert but we didn&#39;t want to wait longer for food. It was busy but a good place rises to the occasion and a waitress at least tries and is nice but this was far from it."

I don&#39;t know if this is a new thing, but I really appreciated that the bartender told us about this special before we ordered anything off the menu.

I&#39;ve been here several times over the past few years and most of the time we sit in the bar area. They have weekly specials like the All You Can Eat Fish Fry, AYCE Ribs, $5 Martini Nights, $3 Margarita Nights.  Whenever we&#39;ve visited, the bartender is always friendly.  She may get busy but always comes around to check on you.  

This most recent time we did dine on playoff game night and tried their regular buffalo wings as appetizers--they also serve teriyaki, garlic, plain and Atomic.  Loved the wings, nice spice and just enough kick.   

According to the menu they only serve fried chicken dinner on Saturday and Sunday nights--something that is listed as that special is definitely worth checking out in my book.  You get 4 large pieces of fried chicken, a salad, choice of potato and veggies of the day--all for 10 bucks!  Worth. Every. Penny.  It was such a large portion that I had leftovers for lunch the next day.  The chicken was delicious.  Nice crispness and not very greasy.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The hubs had the Jalapeno burger and it must have been good because he finished the whole thing. 

As we left, the new friends we made at the bar and the friendly bartender told us AYCE Fish Fry is where it&#39;s at and we should come back then.  The hubs is pretty solid on his word and he said we&#39;d be back soon. So I guess, we&#39;ll be back soon!

They always have coupons in the suburban flyers or the entertainment books, but just an FYI, they do not accept the coupons on AYCE days or any &#34;holidays&#34;."

Great menu, everything is cooked fresh and I would swear the ingredients were recently pulled up from out of the ground.  I really enjoyed my mozzarella sticks.

No one asked how our food was...not that our waitress was inattentive, I just don&#39;t think she cared enough to ask. She admittedly didn&#39;t usually work the breakfast shift. Ok, no biggie but the manager should have asked when we paid our bill.

The weather that day was HOT....like almost 100 degrees HOT......so of course this was the day that the AC at Rooster&#39;s was not working...trying having 40 people in a small bar area and have no air, yeah not fun. 

 There was a bunch of different appitizers for the group which included cheese sticks, nachos, chicken wings, grilled vegetables, potato skins, and quesadillas. The cheese sticks and potato skins were very good. The cheese sticks were full of cheese and not greasy at all and the potato skins had the bacon under the cheese...great idea so then they dont fall off while eating them. The nachos were not good however....the chips tasted burnt and there was not a lot of toppings on them. The chicken wings tasted like bar chicken wings, nothing really great about them and the grilled vegetables I did not even try, but I heard they were ok. After the appitizers the group decided not to eat dinner there.....

The bartenders and wait staff was very understanding of our party and the drinking that was going on from 3pm-12am......so a BIG THANK YOU to Rooster&#39;s for that!!!
They also have a juke box that you could take pictures on as well, we had a lot of fun with this. You get to send the pictures to your email or send them right on to your facebook. GREAT IDEA!!!!"

I think this definitely warrants a review update and a loss of a star. Half price appetizers (no exclusions) is what drew us to Roosters on a Monday night. Knowing that the wings (which we always order) are no longer half price will make us reconsider stopping here.

We got 2 drinks, and 3 appetizers (wings, grilled veggies and quesadilla) and it was around $30.

Really bummed!"

She was the reason we came back a 2nd time and she wasn&#39;t there anymore. So that was disappointing. 

Since then we went back a few times but the food here, besides the wings, is just &#34;ok&#34;. In the summer it has a great outdoor area and if you like to be outside and have a few, it&#39;s a good place to go -- but in my opinion it&#39;s a little overpriced and the service isn&#39;t very good.

Put our name on the list and were told a half hour wait.  OK, no problem.  Hostess says you can wait at the bar and I&#39;ll find you when your table is ready.  So we head down the stairs to the bar and half way down the stairs the cacophony begins to build.  We walk through the doorway and the place is packed with people at the bar and tiny bar tables crammed together with diners.  I can barely squeeze myself between the tables to get to the bar.  We are fortunate to get a couple of seats as another couple is departing.  We shout (literally) our drink orders to the bartender.  She does a sloppy pour of my Guinness (&#34;Geez lady, don&#39;t bruise my Guinness, huh?&#34;) but mixes up a pretty good Cosmo for my wife.  I&#39;m pretty much a Grumpy Gus because of all of the racket. My wife and I can barely hear each other.
We are called to our tiny table in the bar around 6:05 and I see they have little placards for beers like Bell&#39;s Best Ale and Dead Guy Ale.  A smile begins to form across my face as the server comes to the table and says, &#34;How you doin?  You guys need a drink?&#34;  I order a Dead Guy Ale which is promptly delivered and I begin to forgot the din that has encircled me.
We order the fish fry and all I can say is &#34;WOW!&#34;.  As previously mentioned by others, it&#39;s haddock, not crappy whitefish.  The beer batter is perfect.  They are served hot and are NOT greasy.  I checked my plate and you could barely see any oil on it.  I tried both the regular and Cajun and they are both delicious.  Even the fries are really good.  Watch out if you order refills, they are going to deliver a BASKET of fish for two people, not just two measly pieces.
So, they are a winner for two reasons:  solid selection of micro-brews and really good fish fry.  Don&#39;t expect a romantic dinner because the place is a nuthouse.  What the heck, just put cotton in your ears and you&#39;ll be fine."

The building is an old converted barn, complete with rafters and lots of woodwork. It&#39;s currently seasonally decorated, with &#34;gifts&#34; on the walls and stockings hung up.

The waitress was funny and friendly and brought us plenty of water; we explored the hot sauce bar and brought back six different selections to try at our table. We got nachos as an appetizer; they were sufficiently cheesy and chili-covered and the guacamole was really tasty. I had a pot roast sandwich, which was totally delicious and tender and smothered in cheese and grilled onions; the husband had a burger which he said was quite tasty. The fries were hand-cut and really tasty.

We did not have room for dessert, but their options looked delicious. I&#39;d like to try some of their dessert (bread pudding, yum!), and maybe see what their wine list looks like. It&#39;s a fun neighborhood option with pretty darn good food, if you ask me."

Breakfast is a pretty decent selection.  Their biscuits and gravy is really good to me, but the husband thought it should have more chunks of sausage in it.  Whatever, I was stealing bits off his plate.  I got a typical two egg with ham combo and thought it was fine.  The bread was a little weird - maybe the white toast is sour dough?  Husband was convinced that the butter was garlic butter, which could not be the case at breakfast?

I used tto work down the street from Roosters and it would be the site of many after work get togethers.  The final being when our company closed.  The lower level bar and patio is a great place to pull up a stool and throw a few back while yucking it up with friends.  It&#39;s also conveniently located near Indian Lakes Golf Course and Stratford Square Mall so it works well as a place to wind down after a long day on the course or shopping.

This establishment has turned into our regular stop for all you can eat Friday fish fry.  The fish is of the quality of the perch fish fry&#39;s we get in Door County.  Nothing fancy, a light batter and good quality fish.  They used to have two payment options for the fish fry: the less expensive single serving which could be converted to the more expensive all you can eat if one wants more.  I wish they would go back to this as it was a better value.  

The dining room is understated with a great wall of hot sauce.  The hostess table always has a large basket of Hershey kisses to enjoy as you head out (or if you are me, in) the door.  Other favorites: Fried Chicken, Blue Cheese Burger, Cobb Salad."

Oh, and a Sam Adams. That&#39;s it. Considering I only had half of the wings before my stomach started turning I&#39;d say that was about as low-value a meal as I&#39;ve ever experienced. Just stay away."

Why mess with what works?  We have dined here several times, thinking that maybe we went on an off evening. The eating area of restaurant is filthy (floors needing a good vacuum, carpet old and full of holes, the windows which should be the highlight of this lovely building were disgusting, could barely see through, tables had layers of brown paper).  The place appeared to be thrown together.  When we walked in there was (we assume) a manger sitting at one of the tables with a large checkbook register.  Isn&#39;t there an appropriate place to pay the restaurant bills?  As far as our meals, if I could give negative stars I would.  Not only was the food tasteless but their specials for the evening tasted &#39;off&#39;, i.e. mac n cheese and fried chicken.  The mac was sour and the chicken was dry and very greasy.  The burger trio ordered was  micro in size and rather than the burger being the star there was mounds of shredded lettuce and an unripe tomato.  In retrospect we should have sent our food back.  Also, the beer on tap that was ordered was not available as the tap was empty.  This is dinner time on a Saturday night?  Should have walked away when a busy night for them was three tables of only couples.  All said our server was terrific and apologetic when we were asked how our meal was.  Sad to see this one fail because it really used to be a neighborhood stand by."

Some tips: tell them if you want it hot, as the menus said the chicken was spicy and it wasn&#39;t at all. Most Chinese food places give you tons of spicy mustard, sweet and sour sauce, and soy sauce. They do not so be sure to grab some of you want any."

They recently underwent a change of management and the food isn&#39;t as good anymore. Not a fan of the fried rice - the rice is fluffy and the veggies are perfect, but the chicken is gross. I was picking out cartilage and weird grisly pieces... ew!

The egg roll is this place&#39;s saving grace. It&#39;s huge - one is enough for two people - and delicious.

Other things of note: parking lot is kinda small, watch your car when you&#39;re backing out cause there&#39;s always some traffic (and this is the suburbs so NOBODY has any manners at all behind the wheel). They take cards and cash. No seating, so it&#39;s takeout or the highway.

Completely unrelated to the food though, much like most of Christopher B&#39;s post below me... I&#39;m not really sure how an IQ is, in any way, relevant to a carry out Chinese food place.  Its unfortunate that someone as brilliant as you are doesn&#39;t understand basic social interaction and empathy.

As for the food. It was OK, nothing special. I did not like that most of the dishes were only available in one size: Large.

Dishes ordered were:
Egg Rolls
Orange Chicken
Almond Chicken
Yu Shuan Beef.

In my opinion, the egg rolls were the best thing. Everything else was fairly unremarkable in the typical Chinese carryout kind of way.

I&#39;ve had a variety of dishes here, Chicken fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Shrimp Lo-Mein, Egg Rolls, Chinese Vegetable Soup and Fried Won Ton. Everything is fantastic and cooked just right. The beef they have melts in your mouth, the egg rolls are monstrous and the vegetables are always perfectly crunchy, but not raw. 

The value is what really makes this place stand out though. For the same price of most chinese take-out joints, they really load up the plates! For just under $4 you get two egg rolls as big as a soda can. For under $2, the Won-Ton I ordered, they fill a large size box with them, put that in a paper bag and pour even more in, ala Five Guys!

The chicken fried rice was tasty but my sweet and sour chicken had an off taste to it. The fried dough part just tasted really funky.

Out of the 3 Chinese &#34;to go&#34; places in the nearby vicinity, I will say that their Mongolian Beef was the least suckiest. At least I could tell that it was really beef (unlike another place). When I placed my order over the phone, I asked for it extra spicy. They didn&#39;t make it spicy at all, but enclosed a little container of chili sauce. Not really the same thing now, is it?

The service was fast, but somewhat gruff - I didn&#39;t get spoken to, I got grunted at. And the $10 minimum credit card charge rule that is not printed on the menu had me digging for change in my car while my food sat on the counter getting cold."

This is your typical oriental carry-out restaurant with no tables and only a few chairs for waiting on an order. All of the ingredients are definitely fresh and tasty. If I were to judge them in terms of the flavor of the sauces I would say they pretty average rating three stars. But they definitely make up for it by almost doubling the quantity of anything you order for the same price you would pay anywhere else. For Ma&#39;s, the trade-off definitely warrants an extra star for that. Like others have said, the egg rolls are outrageously large, so much so they could be a meal in itself. I like that they have a huge variety of items on the menu, including for the lunch and dinner specials (that include fried rice)."

I loved the food and they have a wide variety of healthier lunch options. For a non-sanwich fan like myself, they have some soup options, salads, pasta, and wraps. 

I ordered the turkey wrap and a cup of soup (broccoli cheddar) during my visit. The woman who delivered my order to the table was so pleasant and welcoming! She explained where everything was (free muffins and ice cream, pickles, etc). I didn&#39;t need any extra pazazz but it was good to know.

The turkey wrap was simple yet tasty and the soup was quite chunky compared to other places. They were both good though. Also, I had a bottled water, the wrap and a cup of soup for less than $10 and that wasn&#39;t even the special! Whaaaaaat?! Cheap and delectable lunch.

If you are driving in off of Meacham/Golf, getting to the parking lot can be a bit confusing as it is essentially located inside the parking lot of the large corporate buildings for Comcast and Catamaran. 

Not only are the ingredients used here always fresh, but this is also a far more healthy option when you are needing to grab lunch. Jason&#39;s prints the pertinent nutritional information on all of their menu items in large print, which is helpful if you are trying to stick to a dietary regimen. Jason&#39;s is also clutch if you have vegetarians or vegans in your group, as their menu is very accommodating. 

The Muffalettas here are outstanding, and are a must try if you have never been in before. Very fresh meats, breads and cheeses! Another safe bet is to go with the soup and salad bar. It is not huge, but it does offer fantastic fresh ingredients complete with homemade dressings, olive medleys, fresh artichokes, and much more. The daily variation on soup of the day to keep things interesting (pray they have the minestrone on your visit). The Broccoli cheese soup is also amazing. I could almost drink it down like a beer. 

Because of it&#39;s location, right near ground zero of numerous office complexes, it get&#39;s crazy busy for the lunch rush. You are honestly better off either showing up early or late unless you like feeling crammed in like a sardine. When I am in a hurry, I sometimes grab a salad bar to go.They have always provided me with quality take out utensils including containers for dressing, soup, and a carrying bag. For 9 bucks you can make yourself a fantastic salad and eat at your desk if you are having one of those days (which happens to me frequently). 

This is decidedly more expensive than most other options in the area that are similar, but the quality, friendliness of the staff, and their efficiency at dealing with such large volume makes up for it in my book."

That is $32 total for four sandwiches, four drinks, and four free ice creams.  Oh yeah--free ice cream.  Did I mention free ice cream?

Jason&#39;s is kind of like a cross between Sweet Tomatoes and an ambitious sandwich shop.  They have a small salad bar and a large menu, mostly sandwiches, wraps, and paninis, but also a few noodle dishes and a couple other random choices.

The sandwiches are not world-beating but mine--the muffaletta--was pretty good.  The sides were weak though--bland ridged chips or crumbly black tortilla chips with flavorless guacamole or watery salsa.  Zzzz.  How about some zingy cole slaw or potato salad?  Or grilled vegetables?

And I&#39;m sorry to complain about free ice cream, but...it&#39;s who I am.  The chocolate side of the machine dispensed near-liquid.  The twist selection was 98% vanilla with a tinge of melty chocolate.  So disappointing.  I really wanted some true twist soft-serve.

These guys would be a solid four stars if they reformed their side-dish offerings and fixed the ice cream machine.  But I really appreciate the value and the crowd-pleasing aspect of their large menu:  they accommodated four generations of my family.

I always gravitate to their Muffelata - can&#39;t find too many places up here that serve them. But I have to say that the quality has declined over the few years they have been in Schaumburg.

They still have the Manager&#39;s special - 1/4 Muffelata with one trip to the salad bar. The sandwich was just okay the last few times we have been there. Unfortunate. As for the salad bar. Well, I have to admit that salad bars freak me out a little bit. The food sits out for - no one really knows how long. I don&#39;t think they were attending it very well that day - some of the lettuce was wilting and careless customers had dropped items in with other items. The lack of attention to keeping the salad bar in order did not make me feel particularly comfortable eating from it.

Last night we ordered a second bowl of chili for my kid.  Got home, no chili.  Called, no one can come because it is after 6.

I ordered chicken noodle soup for myself. It was a bit salty, we added some ice cubes and it cooled while watering it down. 

We had a children&#39;s Mac n cheese.. not so great, tasted like butter rather than cheddar cheese

We had a children&#39;s chicken finger or comparable meal.. part of a finger was eaten the chicken was good and white meat, the breading wasn&#39;t bad but wasn&#39;t great. 

The salad bar was wonderful. My partner and I loved the selections, loved the dressings, and we all loved the ginger mini muffins as an after treat. 

This was our first time. We&#39;ll try Jason&#39;s Deli again."

It was quite clear that many Schaumburg people choose this location for lunch. I had the California Club for lunch- which had several side options- I love choices so that was perfect for me. My husband and friend each had the Reuben/pastrami sandwiches. They were huge and I would never have been able to finish it in one sitting. There were so many options on the menu, I know I will have to go back again to try some other things- the salad bar looked delicious, so did several of their soup choices, and other sandwiches. 

The service was excellent- our food was brought to us quickly, then we were offered dill pickles (which I also love), drink refills, and reminded of the free ice cream throughout our meal. The restaurant was very clean, and I thought fairly priced. I will definitely come back in the future, I enjoyed my experience at Jason&#39;s Deli for sure!"

An upbeat guy answered the phone and I asked if it was still possible to put in an order for pickup. He responded &#34;of course you can! It&#39;s not 10 o&#39;clock yet! Hold on just a second and I&#39;ll take your order!&#34; I pulled in the lot at 9:59 and was greeted so nicely and wished a happy rest of my evening as I left.

They have a variety of fresh deli, soups and other selections.  Some amount of baked stuff like cheese cake Etc.

I usually get the California club which is wholesome. Comes on a croissant with greens , turkey , guacamole and Swiss cheese. One of my favorites and comes with a side of steamed veggies or if you prefer you can get fresh fruits or chips with salsa. 

For 7 dollars and tax is a wholesome meal for a really good price. Service is fast and I always take out. 

Nice place for sandwiches for a reasonable price."

I have tried some of their other sandwiches/soups, and I wasn&#39;t overly impressed. I like to stick to my usuals. 

They have a huge all you can eat salad bar, but I think it is a little pricey. I have only done that once. The service here is always friendly and fast, they clean your dishes up and bring you your food. And of course there is free soft serve ice cream! It still gets really crowded at lunch time, so parking and finding a place to sit can be a pain."

Well, in any case, Jason&#39;s kind of reminds me of a high school cafeteria. Ok, maybe a somewhat health-minded high school cafeteria. 

I had the salad bar with a bowl of the vegetarian French Onion Soup. Soup was pretty tasty, but the salad bar was a bit disappointing. Yes, the lettuce and veggies looked fresh and there were plenty of dressings, but overall I wish there could have been a few more ingredients and a few more cold salads in addition to the potato and pasta salad. It was also a bit confusing having to bring your plate back up to the cafeteria line in order to receive a new one for the unlimited salad bar. Luckily, we were there after the lunch rush, but I could see this being a bottle neck issue when busy. 

Wife had the grilled zucchini  sandwich and soup combo. It was ok. I saw some of the other sandwiches being consumed by other patrons and the sandwiches look comparable to a Panera or Corner Bakery. Yeah they have corned beef/pastrami but I think I&#39;d rather just go to a real deli for a sandwich like that.

So, nothing really too special at Jason&#39;s, IMO. I&#39;d probably just go eat at IKEA the next time I&#39;m around these parts."

Even if the counter people were mean, the restaurant ugly, and the options limited, I&#39;d give this place four stars for having muffalettas that are very much like what you might get in New Orleans. And in fact they are cheaper and more generously stuffed than those from Central Grocery. The olive salad they use is excellent, and they&#39;re generous with it. Their seafood gumbo also had some taste credibility for a fast-food place, though I found it overly salty.

But in addition to that, the counter people are generally nice, the restaurant is fairly attractive for what it is, and there are options aplenty. 

The salad bar is well-stocked--and there are signs indicating that the garlic toast and little muffins are free to all. Even the drink dispenser has a few surprising extras. 

And, of course, free ice cream!

The bad part for me is that since Jason&#39;s is a chain, one can look up the calorie count and nutrition of, say, a quarter of a muffaletta. Sometimes ignorance is indeed happiness."

Today I picked up an order for a few of my office staff members. One of my department managers ordered a Santa Fe Sandwich. I passed out the sandwiches, few minutes later he called me to say he had bitten down on something very hard that came out of the sandwich. I thought he was joking with me, but he was serious! He said he bit down hard and thinks he could have chipped his tooth. We all were kind of fricken out (should we keep eating our sandwich&#39;s??). We starting looking at this thing, it looked to be a piece of metal, like a small round metal pellet. We just couldn&#39;t believe what we were looking at. We were all shocked by this and that he really could have hurt himself or image a child biting down on this sandwich. I knew to call Jason&#39;s Deli right away, I took a picture and emailed it to the store manager to look it over. He right away refunded my money for the sandwich and wanted to send someone to pick up the piece of metal (whatever it was) we found. He think&#39;s it came from a supplier, possibly in the bag of chicken and was passed onto the sandwich when it was made. Sure thing I said! you got to investigate this.  I also told him you should really reach out to this employee and make sure he is ok, and talk to him because from what I know he really bit down hard on this thing and could have hurt himself and or a tooth. A Jason&#39;s deli driver came over to pick up the piece we found and gave me a gift card to give to the employee. I called the employee and told him, hey Jason&#39;s Deli left you a gift card. When he retrieved it from me I obviously handed it to him with a smile and told him I&#39;m sure there buying you lunch for the week or something. Everyone in the office thought the same after what had happened. He tells us he called the 800# on the back of the card and was gifted $10- C&#39;mon! really! The looks on everyone&#39;s face in the office was of disbelief. I think I&#39;ll be buying our office lunches somewhere else."

It&#39;s in kind of a weird location off Mecham and you have to know they are there, but believe me, once you have been, you won&#39;t forget they are there.

We&#39;re often at Costco just across the street, so it&#39;s a quick dinner stop or fast lunch on the weekend.

My first impression of the place is good. It&#39;s clean and well-spaced out. Lotsa of seating. I can see a large group of people here after mass on a Sunday for lunch. It was a little strange because you would think that since you order your food at the counter, the menu would be up on the wall behind the counter...it&#39;s not. They have printed menus you review at the counter and place your order. I guess it was a good thing we reviewed the menu online before we went so that we had an idea of what we were going to order upon arrival, along with nutritional info which can also be found on their webpage. You may want to check it out before you go, because I can see feeling rushed once up at the counter trying to find out what to order.

I told the gal at the register that I wanted Turkey and she recommended The Papa Joe which is toasted herb focaccia bread with turkey breast, asiago, roasted tomatoes, basil pesto sauce with nuts, mayo. It was an excellent suggestion. I chose to have an half sandwich with the chicken chili. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. It was excellent. The half sandwich and chili was def the way to go!!

They have free frozen yogurt for each guest that is located near salad bar. Make sure you stop by before you hit the road.

We didn&#39;t do the salad bar, but it appeared to be maintained well. Clean and fresh. I witnessed more than one employee restocking it during our short visit.

I would have to say overall I was pleased. After writing my review, I kinda want to get there in the next few days....that chicken chili is calling my name!!"

Free froyo and the beefeater, I am so there! I found this place based on yelp reviews and I would have never seen this chain sandwich restaurant shop on my normal commute. It is situated behind a hotel and is difficulty to spot. I went around lunchtime on a weekend and the place was bustling. The ordering process is relatively pain-free like panera. The menu itself has a broad selection from panini, subs, pastas, and salads. I went with the beefeater which is a hot roast beef sandwich with provolone, mayo, and au jus on a french roll which was served piping hot. The portions were of good size with good meat flavors. Personally this was better than quizno, subway, or panera. I ended my meal with free froyo which came in twist, chocolate, and vanilla. I tried them all :) and the best part is it&#39;s FREE!

Pro- fresh made hot sandwiches, FREE froyo, quick service

Con- hard to find, brief wait times during peak hours

Not only is their food delicious, but they know how to operate a restaurant and satisfy customers.  

We had a little trouble with their delivery service and to make a long story short, they definitely made up for it with their  huge apology tray of cookies and brownies.  They went out of their way to do a very nice gesture for us. You have certainly gained a lifetime customer from us.  I wish more restaurants would catch on to this (how to keep/gain loyal customers). Jason&#39;s deli, you are doing something very right here, keep up the good work!

My obsession lately when coming for lunch on workdays is to get the Mac &amp; Cheese! The kids mac &amp; cheese is under $4, the only thing is you don&#39;t get a drink if you&#39;re an adult and order it. It&#39;s a perfect sized portion...still a big portion in my opinion actually.

We placed a delivery order online at 2:23 PM on a Thursday afternoon, not lunch rush, not dinner rush.  The online order system was state-of-the-art, so we easily placed our order for two people.  The restaurant sent an e-mail confirmation.  After waiting for well over an hour, we called.  The guy who answered the phone told us the delivery guy was just leaving.  The delivery guy arrived at 3:41, so it took them 1 hour and 18 minutes to deliver our order.  My friend ordered a strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  They delivered a strawberry shortcake.  The mistake wasn&#39;t a huge deal, because the cost was the same and he raved about the shortcake.  I had a fruit cup that was very fresh and came with a delicious dipping sauce.  We liked that the pickles were packaged.  They were crisp and fresh and didn&#39;t taint the other food, like loose pickles sometimes do.  My broccoli cheese soup was orgasmic.  He said his chicken noodle soup was yummy.  I had a Reuben.  He had a corned beef sandwich.  We both raved about them.  The sandwiches are huge and made with quality ingredients.  The mint hard candies included in the order were a nice touch and welcome after this kind of bad breath meal.  I&#39;m deducting one star for the lengthy delivery time and wrong dessert.

You can get a salad bar, or do a sandwich soup kind of a combo, or both. In the salad bar option, they have whole, boiled eggs, which I love for my organic source of protein. They also have roasted red pepper hummus in the salad bar option -- mmmmm  -- tasty protein!  This is just a healthy restaurant if you can stay away from the ice cream, sodas, juices, and cheese. Salad bar option also has FREE COFFEE!! Yay caffeine! :D   I&#39;m pretty much ovo-vegetarian (I eat eggs, but stay away from milk products, and any type of meat), so this restaurant is GREAT.  Sweet Tomatoes, which is down the road, is  a comparable restaurant, with an unlimited salad bar option, is nice, where they also have pre-made salads and pastas/soups/pizza bread, but I find Jason&#39;s Deli a bit better. Really who needs all the carbs in the cheesy pastas?  But, they&#39;re comparable restaurants, but quite different. 

But I love this place -- healthy, affordable, and great place to eat even on a Saturday night. Great place for kids too. 

Only negatives I found so far: Their low fat organic vegetarian soup has too much oregano and italian seasoning and they keep the restaurant kind of cold in the winter.  Brrr!!

I have not checked if they have free wi-fi yet, but I am assuming they do.

My wife had an American sandwich, while I had the biggest baked potato I think I&#39;ve ever seen (seriously, it must&#39;ve been about a foot long!). The sandwich was quite good, although I didn&#39;t have much of it. 

The potato, which I had with broccoli and cheese, was fantastic. Cooked perfectly, not dense, just enormous to the point where I wondered if any genetic modification was involved. (They use organic when possible, so... I doubt it.) Jason&#39;s don&#39;t stiff you on portion size, folks.

Free ice cream was a treat, and even better, it was good free soft serve; nicely tangy, not tasting like... nothing.

The guys wanted to go here for lunch so I hesitantly agreed, but knew I&#39;d been watching my diet closely.  So I figured id just get their salad bar.  With salad bar, 1 piece of grilled chicken, and ice tea it was 16 bucks.  They guys I was with got a good deal maybe 9 or so for there sandwiches with chips and drink. They of course got the ice cream to which made it a deal for them.

When we arrived there was only one other table occupied and we ordered quickly.

Apparently there is no provision for customer dining in to be served before these carryouts were ready for delivery.  Also, I wanted a simple combo of corned beef and pastrami but had to order some stupid signature sandwich and ask for cheese and other ingredients to be held.

What kind of true deli can&#39;t handle a simple half and half sandwich?

They have a good selection of soups, sandwiches, and the salad bar is great. Plus free ice cream!! The rating gets boosted to a 5 because of customer service and family friendliness.

The kicker that puts me over is the bathroom. As a new mom I dread changing my 4 month old in public. Not here, the bathroom and changing table were clean AND stocked with the papers to line the changing table. This is a big deal because I&#39;ve never seen any place have those actually stocked. Something small, but it shows their attention to detail in keeping customers happy. Jason&#39;s Deli is a great place to stop for friends and family for lunch for as little or as long as you like!"

I had the California Club and my daughter had the Club Royale, and they were both very tasty. She had chips with hers and I had steamed veggies. They also had complimentary mini corn muffins as well as complimentary ice cream - bonus! We both had soft drinks. Our total bill = $20.16 = great deal!"

Recently my office placed an order on their website for pick up at the Schaumburg location . We had heard great things about Jason&#39;s Deli, and being right up the road decided to give it a try.
 After placing the order online around 10:30 am and getting confirmation that it would be ready between 11:30-12, I went to pick up the food around 11:45. A short wait at the counter and quick payment led to being told the order was being bagged and would be ready in just a few minutes. This was all at 11:45am... 

Flash forward to 12:20pm and a good dozen customers getting their food in front of me, the order FINALLY comes out. We only get a half hour for lunch, mind you, and everyone was waiting on the food (and me). Sadly most missed the boat on being able to eat their lunch during lunch-time, and were forced to either wait for dinner to try out the sandwich or scarf it down at their desks. On top of all of the waiting the food was COLD and a few of the orders were WRONG, either missing things or had the wrong sides, but at this point going back or fighting it was moot point as the work day had to resume and I was already in the dog house for having taken so long to deliver on what I assumed would be a pleasant lunch experience. 
Needless to say, we will probably not be ordering from this establishment again for lunch and many of those who ordered will probably not be patronizing any of the establishments they have in the area  in the future.

Note to the restaurant: I understand that you guys were busy, I&#39;ve worked fast food most of my life and understand a lunch rush, but we had placed the order early, showed up early, and had done about all we could do on our ends to not be annoying picky customers so we expected to get the respect back of at least receiving our order at the promised time and with the promised items. 
Please take note and please do something to change the way you do business, because this is just NOT acceptable."

We went here today, and the service was a little more meh than usual. I am used to really friendly employees and today, the girl working the counter was a real grump and she messed up our order. I didn&#39;t let that ruin my day, because the food is always good. I had the Manager&#39;s special with soup and 1/2 of the Club Royale sandwich on white bread instead of a croissant. Pretty good! I wish the whole sandwich was toasted instead of just the bread. They forgot to put the honey mustard on my sandwich, which was a little upsetting and they brought me chicken noodle soup instead of broccoli cheddar, but it was quickly take care of by a helpful table runner. I love the free ice cream and their salad bar is large and fresh. Very large place with great food!"

The first time we went, we dined at the one on Roosevelt Road in S Loop. The establishment was newer and clean. Despite the circumstances of it being overcrowded, chaotic and noisy, the food and service were decent.
 
When we decided to check out the one on Rand Road in Palatine, it turned out to be a regretable decision. The layout was small and cramped; the eatery was disorganized and dirty; the staff were pleasant but the dining experience was something left to be desired: it was hard to enjoy the salad buffet with the foot traffic contaminating it. People had a hard time finding a place to sit because the empty tables, such as the one next to us, were being used to stack dirty dishes and no one was in a hurry to clean up. Honestly, I will never go back to this location!

I had a serious craving for a healthy sandwich and Jason&#39;s Deli came to mind. You know what &#34;they&#34; say, third time&#39;s a charm and I&#39;m so glad we did it! 

Here, at the Schaumburg location, the layout is spread out; the salad bar, drink station and ice cream parlor are off to the side and away from the congestion of the dining area.  People don&#39;t get in your way. We sat on the far West side of the room that had a privacy wall, the exit, tv and window with a view. It&#39;s clean and the dining room attendants are quick to pick up after you. 

Today, I skipped the salad bar and ordered a Reuben THE Great $8.95 sandwich. Instead of Corned beef, Swiss, sauerkraut and Russian dressing on a grilled Rye, I got mine with pastrami and asked for the sauerkraut to be put on the side. Gross. My boyfriend, Jason, likes it a lot so I gave it to him as a side dish. Besides, his pet peeve is for me to ask for things to be removed from an order he paid for in full.

Jason ordered the $6.99 California Club: turkey breast, bacon, Swiss, tomato, sprouts, mayo and guacamole served on a toasted croissant. Both of our sandwich came with a choice of regular or baked potato chips, a pickle slice and soft serve ice cream.

Free refills on fountain drinks, water and iced tea. If you&#39;re going to pick a drink from their open display case, try to reach for the one in the far back. I picked one up front and it was lukewarm milk at best. The counter person let me exchange it for one from their back of the house cooler. Whew!"

Out of nowhere, we spot this place in Schaumburg called Jason&#39;s deli, and we figure they have to have pastrami.  To our surprise, the place is huge, and has a full salad bar.  Took me 5 minutes to study the menu, and discovered the New Yorker.  It&#39;s half pastrami and half corned beef, and it was to die for.  Yes it&#39;s probably bad for you, but it was very juicy, spices were kicking, and it was just tasty.  The salad bar wasn&#39;t too impressive to me.  Sweet tomato seems to have more things offered than this place.  I came back a few days later to try the pastrami.  Well, it wasn&#39;t as good as the New Yorker, but it was still pretty good.  Honestly, I think Mr. Submarine makes better pastrami.
This place isn&#39;t great, but is pretty good.  I&#39;d go back to try some other sandwiches.

I had the Sgt Pepper, (Roast beef, onions, peppers, provolone on a New Orlean&#39;s style french bread) with Au jus (the liquid they cook the roast beef in).  It was amazing flavor with and without the juice, and the meat was so tender!  The portions you get are big and you get chips and a pickle with it as well.

My friend had the New York Yankee (Corned Beef, Pastrami, Swiss and Mayo on Rye) .  The meat was soo flavorful and melted in your mouth!  He had never been to Jason&#39;s deli and literally when the food was brought, he just stared, speechless at it, then took a bite and did not speak for 2 minutes and then just said &#34;wow&#34;.

We also ordered the Plain Jane, this is anything but a pain baked potato.  It comes with butter, cheddar, sour cream, bacon, and green onions.  But that is the not craziest part, the thing is almost a foot long and like 5 inches wide!  We are talking a potato bigger than the plate the food was served on and as big as our meals.  This is a meal in itself, even then it would be a challenge to finish it.  

Between the two of us we finished half our sandwiches, half our chips, and the potato, but it took us forever to do the potato, we just sat, rested and finished it off.  Though the skin on this one was a bit over done and we couldn&#39;t eat the skin sadly, but that has not been the case in the past.

One last thing, FREE ICE CREAM!  yes FREE as in no charge and no limits.  They have cones and they have bowls. And some nice chocolate syrup.

They do have a few organic things, but that is not their specialty."

It was still in their computer system for a while after that, so they still let me order it, but it has since been     removed.  Now, the only way to get it is to have them do a build your own sandwich, which is not only more of a hassle, but also more expensive, and it doesn&#39;t come with the steamed vegetables as a side.

We recently stayed a week in Schaumburg, literally steps away from Jason&#39;s, and ate there twice. Actually my husband ate lunch there every day of his training (Monday -Thursday). We were also visiting with our 5 and 2 year old (picky eaters) children.
Everything is bright and fresh looking inside and I was immediately tempted by the fruit salad (which I had...three times :)
All of the food was delicious and fresh and you even get free soft serve ice cream when you&#39;re dining in. There is a small area to eat outdoors and we decided to do that on one occasion and it was nice. Not much in the world of scenery to look at as it&#39;s located in a mainly industrial area but it was a nice change of pace. 
The only downside is that they do get terribly busy so if you have no other choice but to dine at the busiest times of day make sure you&#39;re prepared to wait in line (not long) and possibly wait to find somewhere to sit."

Yes, you are paying for it with the price of your sandwich, but you cannot find better quality ingredients.  Portions are quite large - a half sandwich and soup comes with chips and a pickle.  The broccoli cheddar soup was thick and creamy.  I could have just eaten it alone without the sandwich.  

They have an all-you-can-eat salad bar.  I did want to try it but did not have time.  The set up is a little confusing at first (I could not find a menu), but the staff was able to point me in the right direction.  Service was extremely friendly and helpful.

I am tempted to try a potato next time.  You don&#39;t even have to buy desert with the free ice cream.  There&#39;s always next time...."

The downside to this place having the word &#34;DELI&#34; in it&#39;s name is that they do not carry the meats one would normally find at the deli such as Pastrami, Liver sausage, Corned beef....Maybe they should call it &#34;Limited items Deli&#34;.

I keep wanting to try something else of theirs, like a soup or sandwich -- or one of the desserts that I&#39;ve been told are really good. But any time I go, I have to get the salad bar. You get loads of high-quality variety, and a nice ice cream treat at the end. Those mini pumpernickel and cornbread muffins are great, too. 

Parking lot sucks if you go during peak hours, which is pretty much any day of the week during normal lunch time. Lunch is really what this place is good at, but you&#39;re best visiting either right at 11am or after 1:30pm -- even on weekends. Otherwise, the parking lot is packed full.

Especially since there&#39;s one close to my home, and close to my office. This is the land of spectacular soups, sandwiches, wraps, salads, muffalettas, paninis, and even some pasta. Oy. 

What I like most about Jason&#39;s Deli is their passion for organic foods, fresh and quality ingredients, and an elimination of high fructose corn syrup. Woot!! Woot!! Let&#39;s not forget they are also gluten free and vegetarian friendly. Even better!

On my visit, I had the manager&#39;s special which was a half sandwich, cup of soup, and fruit. I opted for the Spinach Veggie Wrap ((Organic wheat wrap with mushrooms,organic spinach, asiago, sprouts, guacamole, pico de gallo)) and the tomato basil soup. The wrap was fabulous. The soup was also very good...but a little rich in flavor for my liking. I may just be a Campbell&#39;s tomato soup girl at heart - pathetic, I know. 

The salad bar also looked amazing. For $7.95 you can fill up on pasta salad, egg salad, tuna salad, hummus, cornbread, fresh veggies and fruit, and a variety of other traditional salad bar items. While we were eating, I noticed the salad bar items were constantly being restocked. So no wilted, soggy veggies!!

I chose the 12-12:30 window for delivery based on the meetings that we had scheduled that day. Our food arrived at exactly 12:30.. ok we are good there. The driver was rude and rude is an understatement. He unloads our order so that we can take it to another floor on our building and we notice that our veggie sandwiches are missing. His response, &#34;Oh well, I guess they did not put them in there.&#34; Are you kidding me? I have 25 people upstairs waiting for food and I cannot feed 3 of them. In addition to this, they sent over foodservice bags of chips. This is not a backyard barbeque this is a corporate environment where I now have to come up with a solution for 25 people to have chips so that they are not all putting their hands in a bag. We bring the food upstairs and check everything out and we were in fact missing the veggie option. I called the deli and spoke with the catering department (mind you it is now 12:45) and was basically given the we screwed up we are making the food now and will then have it there. No problem I will have 25 people wait because you did not check our order before you sent it out the door. The food was decent. The fruit was overly ripe, I ended up throwing out many of the strawberries because they were so bruised. The chunks of pineapple were huge and had to be cut. Overall, it was a terrible experience and I do not see Jason&#39;s Deli ever getting our business again"

You couldn&#39;t attend a week long meeting without it catered by Jason&#39;s at least once.  They seem to be the place to cater meetings in the Atlanta area.  Sadly, the Schaumburg location needs some work.

Due to the nice weather we thought we&#39;d grab a sandwich to go and find somewhere to eat outside.  Jason&#39;s has parking and a special entrance for carryout orders.  The cashier directed us to the regular counter to place our order.  The menu doesn&#39;t cover the full menu options so she offered us a paper menu to look at.  While we were reading it, the manager stopped by and asked if we had been to Jason&#39;s before. I said I had but my gf had not.  He proceeded to tell us how big the portions were and nothing else.  Once we decided on our sandwiches, the cashier took our order but didn&#39;t offer suggestions on toppings, cheese, etc.  And because we were ordering to go, we were directed back to the to-go counter to wait for our sandwiches.  Of course this meant we didn&#39;t get a chance to look at possible condiment choices, etc.  No biggie but as we checked on the sandwich selections on the overhead menu, we noticed some items that we missed.   When our food was ready we asked about the additional items and the server directed us to the salad bar and gave us a small to go container.  I asked about pickles because there are signs all over the restaurant noting that &#39;pickle lovers&#39; can choose their own.  The server said that a pickle was included.  After leaving we decided that we&#39;d like some potato chips and stopped at a local 7-11.  Of course we later found out that chips were included with the sandwiches.  We found that the sandwich had been toasted including the cheese. Melted cheese doesn&#39;t travel well so that was a disappointment.  In the end I&#39;d have to say the staff could be more helpful explaining their sandwich options.  I know how to order a ham sandwich but I guess I&#39;m used to the subway chains where you pick and choose while the sandwich is being made.  The pickles had leaked out of the plastic wrap and soaked both bags.  Kind of strange considering they should seem to know how to package a to-go order.   We might give them another try but next time we&#39;ll dine in."

I thought this was my first time at a Jason&#39;s, but she was quick to point I had been to another location some time ago. Chances are I ordered the same thing...

After reading the other reviews I had expected to spend part of my lunch waiting in line, but we had the fortunate luck of having the fire alarm go off which emptied out a good one-third of the tables and parking lot.

The manager was quick to explain there wasn&#39;t a fire (good thing, I was hungry) and I ordered my sandwich. My &#39;usual&#39; is a BLT. I like to get the same thing when going to a restaurant/deli/eatery/whatever for the first time (the other time doesn&#39;t count...).

The BLT was prepared pretty fast given the lunch rush, and even though I&#39;m not a huge fan of toasted bread (why can&#39;t they just leave it alone?) I thought the sammich was very good. Everything seemed fresh and was larger than I expected. The chips were standard potato chips (Ruffles I believe....) but they could have been a knock-off brand. They did not come in a bag and were piled high on the plate with the BLT.

In the mood to at least have something new...I had a glass of the Pomegranate drink that was good. I would likely drink it again.

And they have free ice cream for those who aren&#39;t lactose intolerant.

Overall I would go back to Jason&#39;s, it was something different from the usual Subway and Jimmy John&#39;s stuff."

This place is the perfect alternative to your chipotle, noodles, panera, etc.  We went here for the first time after being persuaded to NOT go to another place based on yelp reviews (Moes southwest grill). 

I was surprised by the epic menu Jason&#39;s deli had. I had no idea that they had a fresh salad bar! I always thought it was just sandwiches, but not at all! They have wraps, panini, pastas, and again a salad bar. OH and they have free icecream! Who does that? Pretty sweet.

I had the Ranchero wrap and the boyfriend had a pastrami sandwich. My wrap was pretty good. My boyfriend also seemed to like his 1/2 pound sandwich.

All in all, I will return here. It is a great alternative to the other local joints we frequent for a quick bite. It is a little pricey for what it is, but nothing crazy about 20ish bucks for two people! Plus they have to make up for all the free icecream they give out somehow!!!"

If she misunderstands your order, she rudely makes you pay for what she heard instead of taking her time to listen to your specific order to make sure it is correct.

Recently, I tried the chicken breast on a pita. The grilled chicken is seasoned nicely and pretty juicy. The pita has always been fresh. The onion rings strike another positive note. 

Today&#39;s lunchtime visit provided a nice surprise. While waiting for my lunch, I was already wondering how I would eat all of the food that I ordered. There was no way, but then the kind gal at the window let me know that they threw in a free cup of today&#39;s chicken and rice cream soup. So, I&#39;m not a cream soup kind of girl, but I opened it and found large chunks of chicken in what was obviously a homemade cup of soup. It was phenomenal!  There&#39;s a reason they threw in that soup. People should know about it. Seriously. It makes me wonder of they make a homemade chicken noodle soup too. I could get on board with that. Aw yeah."

1. Fries weren&#39;t bad; fresh/hot. 
2. Pulled pork had good BBQ sauce on it and they didn&#39;t charge me for extra sauce. 
3. Orange Fanta had bubbles. 

That&#39;s the best I can say. The pulled pork was not smoky like real pulled pork, the bigger lumps were kinda dry, and I definitely needed the extra sauce, but it wasn&#39;t terrible. The terrible part was the bun (like a hot dog roll) which was inedible; hard and rubbery like it had been microwaved. I could not bite pieces off or chew it; I had to eat the pork off with a fork. Which I guess saved me some carbs, but still. Maybe they let them age so they don&#39;t fall apart when soaking up Italian beef juice, but it was awful. 

Probably won&#39;t be back anyway, was just driving by, but I would suggest getting something else."

On 3/11/2014 I tried the Maxwell Street burger and the chicken Parmesan sandwiches. My life changed for the better after having them. Sooooo goooood!!!!

3/23/2014...I had the chicken feta pita with everything on it. If you are reading this, and you are hungry, please drop everything and run to Shorty&#39;s to order one. I promise you it will be on the list of the best things you eat all year long.

4/10/2014...I tried the chicken chipotle. His chipotle is home made (just like everything else) and it&#39;s got some great kick to it. It&#39;s a must try. I also tried the beef vegetable soup, and it&#39;s a true winner. I never would have thought that Shorty&#39;s would boast home made soups, but they do, and they are impressive!

For the rest of the month of April I stuck to the chicken feta pita and the chicken chipotle pita. For the life of me I can&#39;t get enough of either!

It took me about a minute to figure out what I wanted since they have such an extensive menu.  I basically decided on the $4 hot dog, fries and drink special and took a seat at the counter and passed the time looking out the window with my back to the counter.  I sat for a while, not exactly sure how long, but started wondering if they were preparing my hot dog.  I turned around in m y chair and saw a basket with hot dog and fries sitting on the counter.  Gee, my mental telepathy wasn&#39;t working and I didn&#39;t realize my food was ready.  I was only 10 feet away with my back to the counter.  Nobody said, &#34;Your hot dog is ready&#34; or &#34;Number 60&#34; -- nothing.  Three guys behind the counter and they didn&#39;t have the courtesy to tell me my food was ready.

The hot dog came in a puffy, over steamed bun.  The dog itself was a natural casing dog but it was absolutely drowning in relish.  I had to actually look and see if they put onions on because I couldn&#39;t taste them.  The pickle spear was good but they went crazy with celery salt on both the dog and fries.  The fries were crinkle cut fries and were probably the highlight, which isn&#39;t saying a lot.

Shorty&#39;s must be doing such a great business that they can treat new customers like crap and slap together food.  That&#39;s OK, plenty of other fast meal options in the area."

The unique design of the building itself reminds me of an old time drive in. And while it is a drive thru and eat in only establishment it retains a level of 50s charm. There&#39;s a deck with a few tables situated if you choose to eat outside, and a counter with some stools and a few tables inside.

When visiting Shorty&#39;s I was unusually hungry and in an experimental mood, so I decided to try two items, a hot dog and a burger. 

The hot dog I received came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. The first thing I noticed was the huge amount of celery salt applied to the dog itself. There was a thick pickle spear, nearly as thick as the hot dog itself on top. The tomato slices were thick and not too sloppy or wet. The onion, mustard and relish application was fine, and there were a few hot peppers on the dog As I took my first bite pickle flavor easily overpowered everything else. From then on I had to remove the pickle, once I did that, this was a pretty good tasting hot dog.

The burger I received was pretty average for a mom and pop fast food place. The beef was good, the bun was soft, but nothing jumped out about the quality, texture or taste of this burger to reach the level of exceptional.

Overall I liked Shorty&#39;s, it&#39;s a solid mom and pop fast food place. I like the aesthetic of the place. The employees were nice and friendly and service was great. The food was well within the range of average. I would come back here, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to stop. This place is A-OK in my book and earns three stars."

Good burgers, prices are a touch on the higher side but it&#39;s worth the extra dollar or two.

The restaurant itself is very clean and well maintained, but I was not impressed by the gyro. Although the portion was huge, I did not like the way they toast the pita. It was overdone and super greasy. I also wish they would include more than two measly slices of tomato.

The service was pretty slow, also. I felt a bit uncomfortable there, like I was not welcome. The wait was a pretty good 10 minutes for one sandwich."

The &#34;small&#34; pretty much filled me up with a grilled cheese. They serve it with a piping hot pita and some fab homemade Greek dressing. Tons of feta, red onions, cucumber, tomato and fresh crisp lettuce, topped with oregano. I should note there were only two Kalamata olives on it, but that&#39;s OK with me since I&#39;m not really an olive fan. (Olive oil yes, olives no.)

The grilled cheese was nice and hot and cheesy, but nothing special. They do offer it with bacon. :)

But oh, that Greek salad... Now I want to try all their other salads! Perhaps with some soup next time."

Got to say I was completely disappointed. I don&#39;t know if it was the day or hour that I went in, but it was not good. I went in around lunch time on a Tuesday and ordered the gyro meal to go. When I opened this up, there was a lot of dried out, greasy pieces of meat. It was hard and in pieces. I don&#39;t know if they gave me the previous days leftovers or what. I literally had to sift through the meat to find softer pieces. I should have stuck to the sides it came with instead of ordering alternative sides. The rice had no flavor whatsoever and the greek potatoes were way too salty. Needless to say I probably wont be back. I was hoping this place would have been better. Some hole in the walls are hit or miss. I should have missed this one..."

Back in the day, Yes, way back then, Shortys was a Dog-n-Suds. Now , it is a fast food restaurant specializing in Greek Food, Burgers, Hot Dogs and Ribs. The restaurant has a nice little out-door dining area with music piped in through the outside speakers. It is adjacent to the downtown lights and sculptures of Wood Dale. Recently I had the Chicken Gyros there and it was outstanding. Plenty of Fresh chicken  gyros meat served a fresh pita with honey mustard. The owner insisted I try there homemade chicken soup that was prepared by his Dad. The soup alone was Five Stars, just very good. Soup is good all the time and for those fall days I recommend the chili. They have Devil Hot Sauce which adds that heated spice to the entrees. The customer service is good and to sit out and dine is just a nice experience. The prices are very reasonable too. Great to bring the Family out on a Summer or Fall night. They have a vast menu with several specials. The owner and his Family came from Greece to pursue the America Dream. The food rises above that USA Dream for fast food. Just good people serving great food. Its not all Greek to me, I gave Shortys the big 10-4, FOUR STARS. Come for the gyros stay for the soup. (:"

Kinane chicken salad: love getting the classic buffalo chicken salad when I&#39;m not in the mood to be healthy but know I need to get some veggies in. I liked the bleu cheese dressing on the side, though I wish the rest of the salad wasn&#39;t so drenched with the buffalo sauce. Also would have been nice with more crunch with the addition of some romaine or iceberg lettuce.
A pint of revolution seasonal fistmas was a great refreshing accompaniment to this meal as well.

The decor is fantastic, the ladies at the front give you a sample of soda bread, and the music just takes a hold of you so much than you find yourself ordering beer after beer. Peggy Kinanne&#39;s is in a great location downtown in Arlington Heights and is very easy to get to. I&#39;d recommend this for your drinking hole but not for a frequent restaurant stop. 

We came here with a group of four but two were running late. While we were waiting we ordered some drinks and an appetizer. Our waitress was very friendly and in no way was impatient due to our tardy friends. Once we were all there we ordered sliders, a sirloin steak, fish tacos and a shrimp dish.

I knew something was up when the sirloin was the only steak option on the menu and when our waitress really pushed me to get a sauce with the steak. I&#39;m somewhat of a grill enthusiast and know that a good steak does not need any sauce to taste good. The one I ordered was cooked medium and was extremely dry. My mashed potatoes had this weird taste to it as well. Only thing that I was able to eat was the side of vegetables that came with my dish and some french fries that I mooched off my girlfriend. Everyone else also agreed that their food wasn&#39;t the best. 

I really wouldn&#39;t mind coming here again to grab a drink. But I would suggest spending your money on a small appetizer and eat somewhere else."

I like it because the owner, Derek, takes the time to walk around and acknowledge people who regularly come in.  He&#39;s the real deal, straight from Ireland. The servers are friendly and attentive, even when it&#39;s busy. The food is great and regularly changes to keep things new and fresh.   They have a mean corned beef that&#39;s consistently perfect.

So I went for a Reuben. An Irish pub better have decent Corned Beef.
Well, Peggy was on point. The Reuben was scrumptious!

We held a large family party at Peggys last year.  Everything went well and there were no complications or problems.  Great service.

Best of all... The owner.  Derek.  We planned our party with him.  Friendly. Professional.  Genuinely cares about the people that come to his restaurant.  Supports the village.  He treats people right!

Our last visit for a dance performance, he really was terrific to our party and the dancers.

The venue as a whole is very nice. It feels authentic, warm and inviting. They always have it decorated for the holidays. I also love their patio in the summer!
Love the staff here, they are friendly, have great food and drink suggestions.
Last but not least, the food is delicious. I am usually one to stick to what I like but I actually try different things when I&#39;m here. They have a diverse and large menu that has a good mix of Irish fare and pub fare alike. Definately try it if you&#39;re in the area."

I have visited Peggy&#39;s about fifty, so I feel I&#39;m qualified.

It took me awhile to warm up to this place.  The wait staff, while efficient and nice, are not sweet like some places.  But, after awhile, you notice there are many little things they do that make them incredibly kind; like going out of their way to say hi, remembering a food order and asking how it was, or listening and responding to kitchen criticism.  Which leads me to the food.

My only bad meal there ever was a fish sandwich.  I pointed it out, and I have never had a fish sandwich like it again.  Again, they listened and did something about it.  Overall, my other forty-nine meals have all been good.  My wife loves the beef stroganoff.  I love the Boxty&#39;s, sandwiches, deviled eggs... Well, you name it.  It&#39;s all good.  And when you have a kitchen that is that consistent, then you should earn five stars. 

Lastly, the ambiance is nice.  If you want to talk, there are many places you can go and chat.  If you want a crowd and be amongst noise and merriment.  It&#39;s there too.  They have live music on weekends, a packed bar during Friday happy hour times, and the mixture of young and old people make it a great people watch.  One last thing should be noted - the music they play.  It ranges from traditional Irish chanties to classic rock to some modern day pop.  It&#39;s a great eclectic mix.

I would urge anyone who had a bad experience to try Peggy&#39;s one more time.  It is one of those pubs that you&#39;ll look back on when you&#39;re grey or moved away, and say, &#34;Remember that awesome Irish place we used to go get dinner.&#34;  And neither one of you will remember the name because your old.  But, the memory will linger, and that will never happen with a trip to Olive Garden or Tilted Kilt.  (Not dissing, those places are fine too, but it&#39;s doubtful a memory will be created there.)"

They are a great bar and have delicious food, but I was expecting more from them since they are a neighborhood favorite. 

On St. Patricks Day (undoubtedly their busiest day of the year) they charged $5 at the door- which went to the Irish Dancing Troop they brought in. I was happy to pay the cover, knowing it went to a good cause. After waiting 2 hours for a table, I learned they swapped their menu to an &#34;Irish Fair&#39; selection, and upcharged everything....$18 for Shepherd&#39;s Pie; $14 for a Reuben.... just way over priced for normal, every day options. All in all I think customers were overcharged. 

I will be back, because I love this place; just expecting a lot more from a local favorite."

The overall place has a very dark and eerie atmosphere that I surprisingly like better than most other bars that I have visited. Me and my friend sat at the bar and ordered Guinness and different kinds of Scotch. We talked and met some new people while sitting at the bar. It was cool to see just everyday people come together to converse over different topics. When we went here we did not get a chance to try the food but I will be back to update my review.

(Been meaning to go back...) I ordered a club soda and whiskey by suggestion of the bartender - can&#39;t remember what kind of whiskey it was but it was good. Then I got the corned beef sandwich, no bun, and ate it like an entree. I&#39;m not sure if this was an option or not but I would have preferred a vegetable over the potato chips it came with. Regardless... the corned beef was so delicious that I didn&#39;t mind. It was so tender and awesome. I can&#39;t wait to go back. I hope my memory serves me well."

Many Years ago I tried it with a friend and wasn&#39;t impressed wth there menu.   It was just a few Irish fair selections and it seemed the atmosphere just wasn&#39;t there.   But I gave it another try about 5 years ago and boy was I wrong.   The menu is plentiful and the place seemed lively.  My First visit may have been a fluke.
The ribs are great here as with everything else I have tried.  Went there on St Patty&#39;s day weekend and the place was hopping with Irish dancers, Ballon artist, and a hard working staff.    Great appetizers as well.
Note....if it&#39;s winter,  be careful stepping outside.  My friend and I left one night and while standing on the sidewalk outside the front door,  a chunk of ice fell from the roof and missed my friends head by about two feet.

Food is outstanding. I have noticed that the price of the food has gone up, not the happiest with that. Like I said the food is outstanding though. Every time I went there i got seated with my group really fast, besides today. Yes it is the 4th of July but when I went around 130 today the restaurant was dead and the host gave us a pager and said we have to wait for 25 mins even though there were only 4 tables taken on the inside and there were people outside.   So we ended up going to the bar for a drink to wait and try to find out why we had to wait.   The bar tender was amazing though. She took mine and my friends order for drinks and they were very tasty and she was making sure we were okay, as well as took care of the few tables that had people. She saw we were waiting for a table and offered us a menu to order food. So instead of sitting at a table we ate at the bar.   Not really happy about having to wait for the so called 25 mins.

The hostess, who looked like she was barely 16, gave us the option to done outdoors or indoors. When we chose indoors, she gave us a few seating options. After we chose to sit at a table next to a window, she tried to convince us to sit somewhere else, which was a little odd. She also never cracked a smile, which I found a bit strange for a hostess, no less. 

We ordered and our food took a bit longer than it should have for such a slow evening (the place was nowhere near packed or even halfway full). I chose the fish n chips sliders and opted for no American cheese. I liked the concept of a fusion between the British Classic fish n chips and a distinctly American style of sliders. The taste was a-okay, though perhaps could have used more flavor. My only real complaint about the food was that the dish only came with three small sliders and a fairly small serving of &#34;chips&#34; (fries). It doesn&#39;t take too much to fill me up and I gobbled the whole thing! 

Overall, we enjoyed our experience here, though it&#39;s not the best gourmet food of Arlington Heights by any means. I think it&#39;s a little funny that my friend wanted to come here even after seeing the 3.5 star rating, turning down some 4 and 4.5 establishments nearby. Yelp gets it right again! It was a pretty good choice for its proximity to Metropolis Theater as we had just been there for a performance, so Thisbe restaurant gets big props for that. I&#39;m curious about other menu items, so I&#39;d be open to returning the next time I&#39;m in the area."

Her salad was decent, &#34;Hardy Spinach&#34; they call it.  Service was good except for the bus boy cleaning the table next to us.

I explained that the seating would have to be changed because I was uncomfortable there due to recent back surgery. I was given a wooden chair. I requested another table and was promised another if one opened up. Meanwhile people continued to be seated all around us.

I love the &#34;schtick&#34; - it used to be on the menu ,and I&#39;m sad it isn&#39;t anymore, about how the owner&#39;s father, grandfather&#39;s etc, are all Irish pubmen from Ireland (Peggy Kinnane being the name of his... grandmother?).The first time I was there, my waitress greeted me and I heard the Irish brogue I missed from my study abroad trip, and I was super excited. Having been to authentic Irish pubs (ya know... in Ireland), this is honestly the closest that I&#39;ve seen any pub/bar come to in the States. The Irish heritage really shows, and I love it. They even have live music on some nights. 

On to the food and drink: They have amazing food. I have yet to have anything here I didn&#39;t like. The Traditional Irish Lamb Stew tastes exactly what I had in Dublin, and their Jameson sauce is worth writing home about (I got a Braised Pork Leg with the Jameson sauce... oh my god it was one of the most delicious things I&#39;ve ever eaten). I&#39;d recommend trying the traditional Irish fare here, the stuff you can&#39;t get just anywhere else - think of it as their specialty. I&#39;m also a fan of a lot of their signature cocktails, yummy, with fun names, and when I&#39;ve asked my waitress, they even brought me the recipe (it probably helped that I was really nice and moving out of state). 

Yes, things aren&#39;t cheap here - it&#39;s a little more than Applebees, but I love the food, and I find that the portions are nice and big (I can rarely finish what I order, and take it home - it even tastes well the next day)."

This place offers live music, and an outdoor patio. However, last night was my second time visiting Peggy&#39;s and unfortunately will be my last time. Here is what happened:

I met with my date for dinner, and we were seated at a high top in the bar, place was packed, which seems to be the usual for the weekend. Our server was great, food was okay, (I&#39;d give the food 2.5 stars for the quality based on price, $20 for salmon that was mediocre and the veggies that are frozen, not fresh, drinks are pricey unless you do one of their &#34;specials&#34;). After our meal, we were finishing our drinks and told our server we were stepping out momentarily (this is a pub after all), and when we returned after 5 mins, they had cleared our table and my FULL glass of wine. We hadn&#39;t even closed out our tab yet! My date&#39;s credit card was literally just left on the table by our server. Upon sitting back down, what I would assume to be the manager, came to us as if we had seated ourselves and didn&#39;t belong there with a &#34;hey folks&#34; and a questioning look on her face. I explained that this was our table, and my full glass of wine had been removed. She hastily sort of apologized, then said she would get me another glass, then asked if we were moving to the bar. I said no, I would like to finish my wine, then we would be leaving. After all, we came her to enjoy a meal, not take shots of whiskey at the bar. She then rudely asked me if I was going to chug it because her &#34;party&#34; had just showed up and she needed the table. We moved spots for this &#34;big&#34; party when half of the people hadn&#39;t even shown up yet! I found the whole situation to be handled very poorly, and I have never been treated so badly at an establishment in my life!

Servers are great, food is ok for pub food, but management needs to revisit how to properly care for customers. Awful customer service. Thumbs down."

We decided to choose this place as it was known as one of the official Blackhawks Game Bars to watch all the playoff action.
The place is an Irish pub and it had a modern look to it.  The staff was friendly and we were escorted to a high top table in the bar area so we had a great view of their huge projector tv screen.
The drink menu had a lot of Craft Beers bottle and draft to choose from, drink specials, and they have weekly specials as well.  
I tried their flying Iguana drink special, it with Malibu Rum, Pineapple, other juices and hypnotic it was pretty good.  I&#39;d get this tropical drink again.
I enjoy bar food so for our choices of food, they were all just ok.
-For Small Bites: We got the Crispy Man N&#39; Cheese Balls.  You get 6 pieces (basically 3 cheese balls cut in half topped with cheese that taste like nacho cheese (like the one you get in the movie theaters when for your nacho chips).  The mac was dry, stiff, and gummy it didn&#39;t taste like mac n cheese balls and I had my fair share of this type of apps.  They were fried dry tasteless breaded pasta balls topped with melted cheese.  The mac didn&#39;t taste like it was even seasoned.  I&#39;m not getting this again, for that price we didn&#39;t even finish it and that&#39;s rare for us.
I ordered their Fish Tacos, you get three of them.  This was also ok.  But the Chipotle sour cream was a bit too spicy for me and I was hoping to have the crispy cod as a whole filet not cod bites as it tasted more of the beer batter then the actual fish when I took a bit out of them.
My husband&#39;s cousin ordered the Classic Reuben but you had to pay an additional $2.00 for sides of fries, wow really?!?  And he order a cup of Wisconsin Beer Cheese Soup, they were all ok as he stated he had better.
Over all experience, it was just ok.  Drinks were fine so if we go here next time, then I will ask for their popular dishes or read my fellow Yelpers of what was good to eat because I don&#39;t recommend what we order in terms of our food."

The offer some pretty good craft beer and they stay open until 2am on the weekend. What I can&#39;t stand? The live bands. I know live music is part of the pub feel but I&#39;m in my 30s and have heard more than my fair share of 60s and 70s era covers to last a lifetime. It&#39;s also impossible to talk without shouting while a band is playing, not to mention find an open table.

I have been going to Irish bars and restaurants in Boston, Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco since long before I was legally allowed to have a Guinness or Harp with a meal and Peggy Kinanne&#39;s is one of the best Irish bars/restaurants that I have found anywhere in the US, it literally feels like Ireland.   This past Saturday night, my uncle took me to Penny Kinanne&#39;s after he picked me up from O&#39;Hare, I had been traveling all day and he recommended we go there for a late dinner.  The first thing that I noticed when we were inside was the incredible attention to all details surrounding the design of the bar where my uncle and I were lucky enough to find two open seats.  Everything from the wood to each and every effect behind the bar and on the walls of the room, felt authentically Irish.   We were both starving and my uncle&#39;s been going to Peggy&#39;s for years so he knew what he was going to order, and since I didn&#39;t want to delay his eating any longer, I quickly ordered the Kilkenny Salad.  The atmosphere on Saturday night was warm and it felt like a neighborhood bar, with a merry crowd of people, enjoying each others company, the atmosphere and a first class Irish band.   If you enjoy this type of crowd and environment, I&#39;d highly recommend visiting Peggy Kinanne&#39;s on a Saturday evening.  My salad was so amazing that I came back to Peggy&#39;s for lunch the first chance that I had, and ordered the salad again.  But, since I didn&#39;t feel rushed because my uncle was starving, I hung onto the menu after ordering because the menu has so many items that I wanted to take the time to read it.  Wow!  I was working and so I had a pen/paper with me and I literally wrote down 5+ items that I wanted to try while I am in town.  Go for yourself and take a look at the menu, and you&#39;ll see that each section of the menu has authentically amazing items and that each item has unique details that you&#39;ll like.  My guess is that you&#39;ll also find yourself making a list of things you want to try when you return to Peggy Kinanne&#39;s.  After making my list, I came back the very next day because I wanted to try the fish and chips, and that was out of this world!   If you&#39;re lucky enough to have Ellen take care of you, you&#39;ll be in absolutely wonderful hands.  If someone else takes care of you, I&#39;m positive that they too will help you enjoy the incredible details of one of the best Irish bars and restaurants that you will ever find."

They not only gave us a reserved table so we could watch the game but the service was amazing!! Michael, our server was just awesome!! He not only was prompt and attentive but he kept our table cleaner and quietly asked of my daughter could have ice cream for desert without her knowing in case I was opposed to it. The food was awesome and the Cubs won spit was just a great night out with the family!! Thank you Michael for being such a great server!!"

Their food is a delicious blend of Irish and pub food. Their scotch selection is unmatched in Arlington Heights,  and their service is hit and miss. First the food. Being an Irish food fan I was immediately drawn to the majority of the menu. I have yet to order something I didn&#39;t love. There beer cheese soup is in the top 5 soups I&#39;ve ever eaten. Second alcohol.  Being a scotch fan, it is often hard to find a place with even close to the selection that Peggy Kinanne&#39;s offers. They have a wide selection of other boozes, and beers as well.  Finally the service.  You get average service about 50% of the time.  The other 50% of the time the service is poor. I&#39;ve never had what I would call outstanding service during any visit to Peggy Kinanne&#39;s. This is the one area preventing me from giving them the coveted 5 star review."

They seemed to have a wide variety of drinks to please the majority of your group.  The service was friendly, fast, and attentive especially for a pretty busy night.

Trivia-my understanding is that it happened every Thursday from 730-930, so give it a try to win some of your money back!  It was pretty busy with about 12 teams playing trivia.  

This is a great place to stop in with some friends and flex your brain muscle."

After not finding any through &#34;Bring Fido&#34;. Just asked the maitre D and was told, sure, you can sit on the patio with your dog.  Great!  Not really a good place for too many dogs as the outdoor area is narrow, one row of tables deep.  I can see problems if too many dogs, but kudos for them seating me out there. No water available for dogs, so bring your own bowl.  Food was good.  I had the Reuben Rolls appetizer (cleverly filled with corned beef) and the fried chicken salad, pretty basic.  I first ordered an iced tea, but it tasted funky.  It was quickly replaced for me with the requested glass of water.

Since I was there for lunch, can comment on after work atmosphere, or music.  It was a pleasant place to sit outside and enjoy a basic lunch while doing some people watching in downtown Arlington Heights."

Our first visit was on the Saturday before st. Patrick&#39;s day and the place was packed. The wait wasn&#39;t awful and we were able to get drinks from the bar with absolutely no problem while we waited. The food was incredible. They had a special st. Patrick&#39;s menu... My hubby had the corned beef dinner and I had the shepard&#39;s pie. Both were delicious, but the shepard&#39;s pie was literally the best I&#39;ve ever had, even including home made. But the best part of the entire visit was actually the service. Our apps, drinks, and meals came out so fast and we were never searching for our waitress. For such a busy night, it was still some of the fastest, most competent service I&#39;ve ever had. They have a new lifetime customer!"

Number one, the service is awful! We have been treated rudely several times for no apparent reason (standing in the wrong spot, asking for a table when they&#39;re busy etc). Second, it smells like urinal cakes; I think whatever they use to clean the place was made for restrooms. It&#39;s nice to know they clean regularly, but the smell is unappetizing. Lastly, the food is overpriced and mediocre at best. We went in for a late breakfast once, and paid $81 for 4 of us! (For breakfast!) I had a Virgin Mary, which was V8 juice. It cost almost $6. The omelette I ordered was lousy. I made a sandwich when we got home.
On a positive note, the decor is very nice and the location is great. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a fine place to go drinking, just not to eat. Maybe after a few drinks you don&#39;t care how you&#39;re treated."

I have been here with family and also with bachelorette celebrations, and both felt comfortable as there is a clear bar versus dining room area.  The management is very receptive as well.  

The food is very tasty, but nothing that blows your mind.  It is hearty with generous portions and good flavor.   I have had delicious soups, sandwiches and appetizers that I would absolutely try again.  I also appreciate the craft beer selection and cocktails.  

Although many times the restaurant is busy, the food comes out quickly and the servers are very friendly.  This is a great neighborhood spot that I will keep visiting."

The food is good, the menu has a great selection, and the drinks are okay.  

The best part is that it&#39;s pretty authentic.  There are a lot of dishes here that you can&#39;t get elsewhere (like Irish boxty or black pudding and white pudding).  They are quite yummy, too. Except for the mac n cheese (see previous review) I haven&#39;t had a dish I didn&#39;t really like.

That said, almost across the board, they are pricey.  $8 for a glass of wine that would be $5 or $6 elsewhere.  $15 for bangers n mash.  $16 for shepherds pie.  $12 for burgers that would be $10 or less anywhere else.  

A couple times we&#39;ve gotten good service, but most of the time, we end up with this guy (I think he might be the manager) who doesn&#39;t seem to be all too pleased with having to serve us.  He&#39;s usually kind of impatient with us, and treats us more like a friend asking for a favor than a group of 20 people forking out a lot of money at his establishment (plus, we&#39;re pretty good tippers).  Last time we were there he chastised me for ordering a glass of wine by its full name, when I only did this because he couldn&#39;t hear me and made me repeat it four times, and there were two different brands of the same type of wine.  

It&#39;s a nice place with good decor, a great selection, and good food, but the prices and the service are making us consider going elsewhere for future get-togethers."

We were here on a Friday night when there was a U2 cover band.  We didn&#39;t have to pay the cover, though, because we were in the back eating.  I think it was $3, though.

In any case, our drinks were good--I got a Mai Tai and a June Bug.  They were recommended by the waitress, and she didn&#39;t steer me wrong.

As for food, just...don&#39;t.  They had a specials menu that sounded like it had potential (with loaded Tot-choes) but we got apps and I got a BBQ burger w/ mushrooms and a side of mac n cheese.  The nachos were icky and the crab dip was totally inedible.  The soft pretzels were good, but it&#39;s hard to mess that up!

My burger was sort of disgusting, and I don&#39;t even want to talk about the mac n cheese.  It tasted straight-out-the-box.  And not the blue box.  Like velveeta knockoff.  I ate literally one bite.  Everyone who knows me knows that I would NEVER reject mac n cheese, but this was inedible.  It was quite sad.  My husband didn&#39;t enjoy his breakfast boxty, either.

It was my friend&#39;s birthday, so she had a little dessert lava cake and we all sang, and the lava cake was just like the one they serve at Applebee&#39;s.  Meh, be original, Peggy!!

So first off I went there to eat with a friend. I ordered a burger well done and when it came I put my ketchup and mustard on it then cut into it. The burger was way too red for my liking. Not well done at all. So I asked them to kindly take it back and I wanted a well done burger. The waiter apologized and took it. The owner then comes back with the burger and I see a cut mark in it with ketchup and mustard on it. I then asked did you really just take the same burger and put it back on the grill!? Owner replied yes I&#39;m sorry did you want a new one? I am just baffled. Newsflash guys when you put a burger back on the grill after I already put condiments on it not only does it make the burger soggy but dry as hell. You guys make a crap ton of money. You shouldn&#39;t of even asked me if I wanted a new burger. That&#39;s what you just should of done to begin with. So I then eat my disgusting dry burger since I&#39;m paying full price for it cause lord forbid you deduct anything from the bill for your stupidity. So a week goes by and I said I&#39;ll try you guys again. I got off work on a Sunday I wanna say 9 p.m. you guys close at 1 a.m. I get to you by 10 p.m. and you tell me you&#39;re closing early to clean floors. O.k. no prob. I come back next Sunday around the same time and you tell me the same damn thing! Apparently the machine broke down the Sunday they were supposed to originally be done so you now are getting them done this Sunday. The owner then tells me don&#39;t always go by the hours on the door. Hey how about this.....how about posting your accurate hours on the damn door so I know when I am able to dine there!? There are people who work night hrs and can&#39;t always come around normal dinner hours. I really loved you guys but after these incidents....3 strikes you&#39;re out.

We went for an early dinner. At 5:30pm there were about 5 tables of people scattered throughout the restaurant. By the time we left the bar area was full.

My friends went with a bottle of pinot noir $30 and I had the Cucumber Cooler $6 - Effen cucumber vodka, water, splash of sour mix. Both were tasty and the cucumber drink was refreshing/not sweet. They have $3 miller draft as well as other drink specials.

For dinner I went with the small plate portion of fish and chips, my friends ordered the firecracker burger and bangers and mash. We also ordered the Irish soda bread to start off. Personally I would not have ordered the bread. A small loaf of raisin bread for $8 eh. 

Small order of fish and chips was more than enough for me. There were approximately 6 little nuggets of fried cod and a small handful of potato wedge fries. I have never had this dish as nuggets. At other establishments I have had it as strips. The fish is breaded heavily and fried crispy. The potato wedges are also slightly crispy.

A creamy delight! The second time... I was a little sad. I suppose that&#39;s with any place... Different chef I&#39;m sure.

But yesterday my wife &amp; I came in since it was the only bar in the area and we had 1 blue moon and 1 miller lite each and our tab was $25!  A Miller Lite bottle was $5 and a Blue Moon draft was $6.50, neither of those including tax.  That&#39;s more money then a beer in Chicago.  Just ridiculous.

The kicker was that it was after 9:30pm and many of the restaurants were already closed, as was the Starbucks. Lo and behold, Peggy Kinnane&#39;s was open (til 1am, so read the sign). I thought I would just have a drink, due to the fact that I&#39;m vegan and didn&#39;t think there would be anything I could eat there, even though I was so fricken hungry. The manager (or owner, could it be &#34;the&#34; Peggy?) informed me that any of their burgers could be made with a veggie patty-- heck, yeah! What&#39;s more, my burger was positively delicious (roasted chiles, avocado and carmelized onions).

It served as the post dinner drink location and nothing more. After my short lived experience I won&#39;t necessarily be rushing back there - to drink or eat.

Service was served with a side of attitude. The music was ridiculously loud. And the drinks were slightly over priced. Sadly, nothing about my experience was mind blowing.

Would I return for another go-around for drinks, or give the food a try? Meh...maybe. I&#39;m all about second chances. But, based on my fellow Yelpers&#39; reviews - I&#39;m not expecting anything grandiose or memorable."

Before I begin this review, I think it is fair to point out that the owner of Peggy Kinnane&#39;s went out of his way to accommodate our group of 11 despite the fact that the whole restaurant was booked solid that night. I was going to book the dinner a week in advance when I learned that Irish dancers would be performing that night and they essentially filled the place to capacity. While they were turning away walk-ins, we had our spot secured in the back of the restaurant.

Anyway, this restaurant/Irish pub is located in downtown Arlington Heights, just south of the train tracks. Once you go inside, it&#39;s part bar, part restaurant and part museum of Irish memorabilia, vintage Irish beer signs, old political advertisements and lots of other cool things encased in cabinets around the front.

We got a fantastic looking booth &amp; table combination in the back with these slender wooden chairs that look like they were carved out of a tree trunk. The walls are adorned with Celtic inscriptions and artistic motifs throughout. And it&#39;s by no means a noisy place despite the massive crowd turnout that night and the dancers in the main room next to the bar. We were able to carry on our conversation as usual without having to yell.

Our waitress was Kelly and she was quick to take our drink orders once we were seated. Glancing at their menu, I liked that many of the traditional Irish dishes like banger sausages or corned beef had interesting little narrative about their origins, giving authenticity to the whole surroundings. I went for the Connacht burger, which had cheese, bacon, mushrooms and a great BBQ sauce on it. I upgraded to the onion rings as my side. While both the burger and o-rings were great, I don&#39;t think the upgrade is worth $2 more.

Best item on the menu may be the fish &amp; chips. Don&#39;t let a couple negative reviewers fool you on this one. The fish pieces are more like rounded cubes and it&#39;s a huge serving size. I noticed everyone who ordered them from our group had some to take home as well. A great side to go with it has to be the deep-fried green beans. I tried a bite of Giselle&#39;s green beans and yes folks, even healthy green vegetables can be deep-fried and taste awesome. 

Considering the busy night, our food came pretty quickly. My only other complaint is that our waitress Kelly left us for a prolonged period of time during dinner after our food had arrived. But in the end, we were filled up and none of us had room for dessert.

Overall, I like Peggy Kinnane&#39;s and having dinner there on a super-busy night really put it to the test, which I believe it passed."

A little loud up front, but we were there right before the band played on Saturday night. I had the fish and chips since its one of the few items in the menu that&#39;s pretty much dairy-free (I couldn&#39;t justify getting the asian chicken salad at an irish pub). Great batter and great fries! Ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day. It was VERY fried, though. It made my stomach gurgle a bit more than usual. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was twice fried since the batter was so thick. 

Also learned that their &#34;snakebite&#34; is different than the snakebites I&#39;ve had at every other bar I&#39;ve been to. I thought it would be a Guinness and cider, but it came out a harp and cider. Apparently what I wanted is called a black velvet or something. I wish the waitress had paid attention to me explaining what it was to my friend when we were ordering so she could have corrected me and brought me what I was expecting.

They are so good, and you&#39;d probably like them even if you don&#39;t like curry.  Well, my family and I decided to go to Peggy Kinnane&#39;s for beer and appetizers one Sunday afternoon, and let me tell you, I just about threw my eyeballs on the floor when I saw they had curry chips.  They taste just like the ones I had in Ireland, and I was instantly nostalgic.  I haven&#39;t seen them anywhere else.

The other appetizers were well enjoyed by our crew, and we all appreciated the numerous craft beers on tap.  There are enough TV&#39;s around the bar to make any sports fan smile.  If you&#39;d prefer a quiet meal, there are other dining areas around the place that will suite your needs.  Go for drinks and a game, or go for a family dinner.  You&#39;ll be happy either way."

Lately I&#39;ve been more inclined to be more adventurous, and stay away from the usual, known, safe-choices with my food selections, so I have been trying new things.

I almost always go with the pick two, and go with half a Fontega Chicken panini and a bowl of Broccoli cheddar soup. This afternoon I stuck with the pick two, except I selected the Strawberry Poppyseed Salad, with Chicken, and a half a Chipotle Chicken Panini, with a side of an apple, and their Green Tea.

The salad was awesome! Filled with strawberries and fruit, and plenty of chicken, and a great portion I may add! The panini, was....just okay. A lot more calories than my usual Fontega, and it was just a plain, &#34;okay&#34;. If it&#39;s going to cost me an extra mile or two to run off calories, it better be worth it! But....it wasn&#39;t. I probably will not be getting it again. 

On the plus side, I think I&#39;ll go with a full salad next time and stick with the Strawberry Poppyseed, with Chicken! Pics to follow."

Yesterday was just the icing on the cake.  My friend and I arrived there at 9:30 on a Sunday morning.  Although it was early, we weren&#39;t really in a &#34;breakfast&#34; mood.  They were pretty busy, but they were ready when we were.

Their soup wasn&#39;t ready yet (no stars docked for that--it was only 9:30 am, and I would rather my soup at 6 pm NOT be the same batch around at 9 am, so props for that).  So I got a 1/2 panini and 1/2 salad instead.  My friend got a sandwich.  We both added a drink and a treat for $.99.  Our total was $21 and some change.  Whew...pretty steep for JUST soups and sandwiches.

But what really gets me is that my friend and I went and sat down (no pager given, but they did know my name).  At every other Panera, they call out your name if they don&#39;t give a pager.  My friend noticed that our food was taking a really long time, and happened to look over towards the counter.  Yep, there was our food.  Nobody said anything, and it was just sitting there getting cold....

So needless to say, the food wasn&#39;t all that great after sitting there abandoned for a while.

I love the food at Panera, But at this location the staff is not only rude, they apparently don&#39;t need any sort of education to work there. I waited in line for about 10 min (they were a little busy, thats fine) but as I stepped up to the counter to order, some guy swooped in front of me who was not waiting in line. It was clearly obvious he cut, yet the girl taking the orders said nothing! A simple, &#39;sorry sir you have to wait in line&#39;  would have sufficed. He then took a good 5 min to order his food, which seemed accessive for a fast food order, though I understand what took so long as soon as I got up to the counter......

I simply ordered a half sandwich. Thats it. Pretty simple order. The girl behind the counter was pushing buttons on the screen for about a minute before she looked at me and rudely asked me for my order again. After about another minute... she told me &#34;$7.25&#34; which I questioned her, because a full sandwhich is only $6. To which she then seemed extremly pissed off as walked away. ?? I had no idea what was going on until she came back out with a manager, who cleared the screen and asked me for my order AGAIN. At that point, I told them to forget the order. 

How do you hire someone who cant enter a simple order into the computer?

I will have to say the manager tried to resolve the situation by giving me a gift card for a meal. But I will not be returning."

I&#39;ve been there three times and each time the employees are slow, borderline rude- for example today two employees had their backs turned and seemed annoyed when I approached the cash register to order. Layout is terrible, and tables too close together, dirty tables and gnats flying everywhere.  Do yourself a favor and drive 1 mile west to the other Golf Rd. location."

I went there for my lunch break (4:30-5pm I was in the restaurant and it was not busy at all and no lines) with a book to try to eat and relax on my break. I ordered a you pick 2 of a 1/2 sandwich and the fugi apple chicken salad. I asked for 2 dressings on the side, no onions, no tomato, add cucumber. I went to sit down as I waited for my food, and ALL open tables were super dirty. I had to ask to have the tables cleaned before I felt it safe to sit down.. I sit down, Im hungry and get my book to start reading and take 2 bites of my salad and they forgot to add chicken to it. how do u forget chicken? it is in the name of the salad. I take it back and a girl who was just on the register, not wearing gloves, takes my salad to have them add chicken. I said, she was just handling money she should not be touching my food and I requested for a new salad to be made. I told them my requests with the salad. they apologized and I thought I could finally eat..... nope. I sit down and they didn&#39;t add cheese this time to my salad.I go back to the counter where I now see who I think is the manager for the first time on the floor. I told them they didn&#39;t add cheese this time. and by the way I repeated each time what to have and not have on the salad as I originally ordered it.a different employee then come around the corner with gloves on that look like he has had them on all day takes my salad to add it. at this point I requested for him to change his gloves as he just came from who knows where doing who knows what. I very nicely asked for them to just make a new one and make it to go as I have now spent my lunch break asking now for a 3rd time to make my salad as I ordered. they apologized and I spoke up to ask the what seems like the manager his name. he told me Joe. I told Joe of my experience today and that I was hoping for a nice lunch and now I don&#39;t even get to eat and have to go back to work. oh and I had 30 mins of time available to sit there also over my break. Joe offered me a refund for my meal after the 2nd salad mistake. I said thank you, I just wish I would have been able to enjoy sitting and eating my meal. so after the 3rd time of them remaking my salad, I told Joe, the manager, that I would be writing a review of this experience on yelp and using his name. he them was like, oh can I offer you a voucher to use in the future? funny about the timing of him asking don&#39;t you think, but it was nice of him non the less. I accepted and he provided me with 2 $6 vouchers for any panera. I plan on going back to panara, but I will be avoiding this location until they start to clean their restaurant and tables and understand what wearing clean gloves and customer service is among the entire staff. I&#39;m new to yelp reviews, but wishing I took pictures of each time my salad was wrong  and the dirty tables as proof but I was just hungry and irritated at that point. The manager gets a star for providing a refund and voucher and apologizing. he was nice, but this particular location, I think the staff needs to go through a customer service training as well as have a talk with health services about keeping their restaurant cleaner....... update, sat down to try to eat my salad at work and they put red onions on it. really? glad I only gave 1 star."

My love of bagels had waned in the past 10 years or so. I had always liked them, and in my 20&#39;s, had eaten them for breakfast on many occasions. However, since all you hear about in the dieting world is the evil of carbs, bagels became a no-no. Gradually I just stopped eating them until I almost forgot they existed.

Oh, do they exist. They are back on my radar. And let me tell you why.

A friend and I were doing a little shopping. We got an early start, and my friend decided she wanted to &#39;pop in&#39; to the Panera &#39;real quick&#39; and just see what bagels they had. She got a Cinnamon Crunch and insisted that I get one, too. I was trying to be good, and reminding myself that I do not eat bagels anymore due to their carb content. I finally relented when I got a whiff of her warm bagel loaded with cream cheese. How could I have said no? She insisted - and this is not a friend I can say no to.

I had never tried bagels from here before. The salads, yes. The soup, the bread, yes and yes. I have had lunch at many a Panera on many occasions.It is one of my favorite places to have lunch, But never tried a single bagel until now. 

I understand why she has an addiction with the bagels here. More specifically the Cinnamon Crunch. Oh my word. It was pure bagel heaven. I had mine with the Maple Walnut cream cheese. My taste buds were singing - no, more like yodeling. I think I wolfed that thing down in two minutes. I was ready to rip my friend&#39;s out of her hand and finish hers, too. After all, it was her fault for introducing me to it. She created a monster.

I guess it took this to finally write a review for Panera. Despite the hundreds of meals I have had there. This should tell you how much I liked that dang bagel."

I&#39;m in sales and often find myself out in the middle of some suburban location in need of wifi and a delicious bite.  Lo and behold my savior for the day, Panera.

Why the 2 stars you may ask this self proclaimed Panera-manian... My cashier today was abominable.  Yes, like the snowman.  So I understand that certain marketing can be highly protected... I get that.  What I do not get is why the cashier had to be Miss Snippity Snappity Pants when I took a quick pic of the yummy mango &#34;shmoodie&#34; poster.  FYI, I was tweeting this pic to my friends because all weekend long we had this obnoxious craving for &#34;shmoodies.&#34;

Because of that, I got to know some of the staff pretty well. The food here is pretty much the same you can receive at any other Panera. My favorite thing is the Spinach &amp; Artichoke Baked Egg Souffle, but those are only served till around 1030am (damn). The rest of the food is standard Panera food. 

The biggest inconsistency is the service. 

One of the store managers &amp; a shift manager, Marisa, are incredibly nice and friendly. They came to recognize our consistent presence so they made the effort to introduce themselves, ask how we were doing, and usually stopped by and encouraged us during our studying. 

Another manager has consistently treated me with an attitude that barely teeters on polite. She would speak to the tables around us then walk by us, would seek us out first when it came close to closing time, and during their text message promotion, flat out refused to honor the text message, claiming it was not what it said. (The text said a free baguette: first she said that it had ended, then that it was just another piece of bread with your soup, then that she did not have bread. Isn&#39;t Panera also supposed to be a bakery?)

The Jekyl/Hyde service is the most frustrating thing here. Of course, you get some motivated teenagers and some apathetic teenagers working there, so that also accounts for that. The only other thing to note is that if you stay to eat, the heat only kicks in when the store gets to a certain temperature, so you get a cycle where the place is warm then becomes freezing, then warm again. I usually just made sure to carry a hoodie with me when I studied.

This place can get really busy, especially around lunchtime. It also seems to be a popular spot for people to meet for job interviews."

By far one of the worst sandwich places I&#39;ve ever been to. The turkey was STILL frozen inside the panini- thats exactly what your looking for in a fresh and toasty sandwich, the cheese was greasy the bread was soggy and limp- I wish I could throw up and empty out my stomache.

When my order was rung up It came to $3.70something, I was rather confused since the cherry pastry was in the low $2 range.  Turns out the bagel is free but the cream cheese is not.  Who does that?  That&#39;s like giving someone a free salad but charging them for the dressing.  Panera corporate peeps if you&#39;re reading this, stop being cheap.

I ordered a cafe mocha, a chocolate milk, and two plain bagels with cream cheese.  The milk was handed over right away.  Then the girl proceeded to get two fresh bagels, slice them, stick them in the toaster, and stand there and watch them fall out.  Then she put them back in the toaster and stood there and watched them fall out again.  And I&#39;m pretty sure she repeated this, at least, one or two more times.  Why you ask?  I have no idea.  I&#39;m guessing that something was wrong with the setting on the toaster... I have no clue.  Anyhow, after finally getting the bagels done, now I had to wait for her to make my mocha.  Shouldn&#39;t this have been done while (or even before) the bagels were toasting so that they wouldn&#39;t get cold now?  Couldn&#39;t she have asked one of the other people back there to help her make it?  The girl was very nice, but it did seem a little disorganized back there.  So we, finally, get our breakfast and on to the next step... trying to find a place to sit.  Warning:  this Panera is quite small in comparison to several others.  Once a seat was found and breakfast was eaten, all order was restored and my day could continue.  But, honestly, I might have been better off looking for a Dunkin Donuts."

And who can find fault with their homebaked bread and great sandwhiches?  But folks, this particular is just nasty.  It&#39;s a shame, too, because it&#39;s in a great location, it has a good vibe, free wi-fi, the staff is nice if a little incompetent, and the manager seems very together and professional.  BUT THE FOOD!!!  It&#39;s so bad it&#39;s shocking.  

Because this panera is right by school, I have tried over the last six months, in vain, to find something-anything worth eating here.  Forget the pastries:  they may look good, but they are stale-stale-stale.  Like, I am positive that some of the things I tried were at least a day old, if not older. The brownie was inedible--and I am not a picky chocolate eater, folks.  It was both gummy and dry/crusty--not a good combination. The pecan roll was stale, too.  I tried one of the muffins--forget which one now, mercifully enough, but suffice to say I took one bite and gagged.  The large toffee cookies they sell individually wrapped at the front were stale and inedible. 

I thought : okay, they can&#39;t get the baking thing down (or rather: throwing out stale items in a timely manner)  Fine.  I tried the soups.  I usually LOVE the black bean soup at Panera and so I ordered that.  Gag!  Believe it or not, it has hardly any beans in it!  And it&#39;s like they purreed some of it, so it&#39;s a sort of thick goopy mess.  Really it was the worst bean soup I&#39;ve had in my life.  Fine.  I&#39;ll try chicken noodle.  You can&#39;t mess up chicken noodle, right?  WRONG!  OMG, it was awful.  Like: no meat I could see, weird, mushy noodles and not many of those, either.  Mostly it was the gelatinous clearish/yellowish goo with LUMPS in it, so that it ressembled a bodily fluid one would rather never ingest.  Upon examination, I figured out that what it was is that they use copious quanitities of corn starch to thicken the soup, and then either added broth or bouillion cubes or something to it.  Oh, it was wretched.  To top it off, the iced tea had a distinct mold taste.  

What I&#39;ve figured out is that this is a very, very, very, very CHEAP Panera.  That&#39;s what all the horrifying food is about: cost-cutting. Thus you get the yellowish corn starch thickened goo instead of chicken noodle soup; purreed black beans to fluff out another thin soup; old pastries, old tea.   I am certain that this is NOT in line with the Panera franchise and am seriously considering lodging a complaint to their corporate office.

A last note:  I feel sorry for the staff because I think they must get a lot of complaints.  After the brownie incident--which was the first thing I ever ordered there, I told the girl:  okay, so the brownie was pretty bad, what&#39;s fresh?  and she looked very embarrassed and told me I could bring anything back if I didn&#39;t like it.  Later, after the black bean soup incident, I mentioned it to one of the guys behind the counter and he looked sort of nervous and said: um, yeah, I know what you mean."

Now I find myself there about every other week on the lunch rotation and lately when I simply get home too late...like 7ish---I just stop here. It&#39;s clean, fresh, tasty and for the most part healthy. The Med sandwich and salad are what I often crave. Just have to have it. Greek style salad with a dressing that has a bit of a kick all for around 450 calories...I want one right now. Also the buff bowls are a great option for the carb conscious. Spinach instead of noodles and trust me ...you do not miss the noodles because everything else is so good and satisfying. Calorie counts are everywhere so go ahead and get that strogonoff...my husband&#39;s fav...or mac n cheese my son&#39;s fav. I&#39;ll stick with the lighter and more colorful flair. Lots of choices and can be customized. Pot stickers are really not bad at all. 
For a fast casual...its nice to eat with real dishes when you eat in and not have to worry about tips. Cheap for the quality of food you get.

I normally go for the spicy caesar wrap, and a side salad no dressing.  Do not order their caesar, since they seem to believe that people want their lettuce drowning in caesar dressing.

I would like to see this place with an adult in charge.  Each time I go, the place is ran by a ton of teenagers that all seem to be having a little too much fun.  It&#39;s okay to have fun at work, but when you have a ton of customers waiting, it&#39;s time to get focused."

I was excited about trying the fancy pants mac and cheese i.e. the truffle mac. They describe it as having Mac &amp; Cheese sauce spiked with white truffle oil, saut√©ed baby portabella mushrooms and topped with parmesan cheese and house-made toasted breadcrumbs. Our order was quickly taken at the register and you had the option to add a soup or salad to your meal as well for 1-2 dollars more. We grabbed our number and took a seat and within a couple of minutes our food came. First of all the mac and cheese was lukewarm. Next the noodles themselves were undercooked and had a crunchiness above el dente. Finally the dish itself was rather bland with minimal cheese which made it difficult to finish. All and all two thumbs down. Maybe I should try something else next time instead of the house specialty.

Food can be expensive, so it really isn&#39;t a cheap place to eat, though I do love the Coca-Cola machine and its endless choices.

I always get the Asian Salad and its a great, low-cal option there and it completely fills me up.   However, I HATE that they do not chop up the chicken.  Its in huge pieces and your dish is so full that you end up loosing some food in order to cut up you chicken.  I wonder if I can ask them to cut it..."

For this price, we got:
Small Truffle Mac N Cheese
Small Japanese Noodles
Small Mac N Cheese
Small Chicken Noodle soup (which was only $1).

Doesn&#39;t seem like a lot of food for the price, does it?  We didn&#39;t think so either...

The food was ok.  Not as great as when I had it in MN, but I guess some places within chains are better than others.  It was fast and tasted ok, so they had that going for them.  I really liked the skin on the shredded chicken in my soup, though.  Good touch!

I will choose this place over any place any day of the week. I can never get sick of eating N&amp;C. HOWEVER....this particular location is horrible! 
Not only was I deceived by the illusion of a big location but the food prep was wrong. The older lady at the register had no idea how to take my order. She kept asking if I wanted spices on my buttered noodles. My response was I want it done the way it&#39;s described. One really cannot mess up buttered noodles. Well....I got buttered noodles with no spices. I had to ask them to make my food TWICE. 
Then there was a bus boy who kept coming over to our table and asking to take our plates away when we would stop eating (even though there was food on our plates). I had to kindly ask him to not return as I will be eating everything on my plate. 

Location: Ok
Size of location: small
Cashier/Order taker: needs training
Cook/Kitchen staff: learn the menu
Bus Boy: please stop coming by so often

Will this stop me from eating at Noodles and Company? No but I will not be returning to this location ever again."

They  had the sandwich sitting there 2 minutes after I paid, but it got cold (assuming it was ever hot) by the time they finished the other stuff and gave it to me.

I didn&#39;t eat the penne rosa  because that was for someone else, but the bbq pork description said &#34;loaded with slow-braised pork, colorful coleslaw and barbecue drizzle&#34;.  There was probably half an ounce of pork, some red lettuce, and chunks of white stuff and what I think was mayo.  I&#39;d assumed the coleslaw would be on the side, not in the sandwich but that was my mistake.  But back to the pork, it was more like a shredded pork spread on a huge bun than really &#34;loaded&#34; with anything.

Admittely, the pork tasted good, what little there was, but it was definitely not worth $6.99. After picking out the coleslaw, the little remaining pork was not even a mouthful. I pitched the rest, not even trying the bread.  I was very disappointed.  This is why I don&#39;t like trying new things. I get ripped off or find the food is unpleasant.

The pulled pork alone, without the slaw or bread, probably would have been good, although not worth more than $1.00 for what little there was.

I might go back to try the spagetti and meatballs, but probably not as I&#39;m guessing the sauce will be mostly a blended tomato.

I guess it&#39;s my own fault for trying pork at a noodle place."

I will forever beg for her forgiveness after recommending we go to this one. 
First, we both agreed that the staff was perfect. Our poor experience had nothing to do with them.
I ordered the Wisc. mac with parmesan crusted chicken. I&#39;ve never had the chicken before, but my friend had (she suggested it) so I thought it&#39;d be fine. It was disappointing to see hardly any cheese sauce on the bottom and a giant pile of shredded cheese on top. It was almost too bitter and tasted completely different than the other locations I&#39;ve been to. I don&#39;t even know how that can happen. The chicken wasn&#39;t all that great either... It was breaded and tasted strongly of lemon and not a whole lot like parmesan. When my friend tried it she said it was nothing like what she&#39;s had before. It was overall a &#34;meh&#34; food experience for me.
My friend ordered the Wisc. mac n cheese with meatballs and noticed a difference right off the bat. The meatballs had a &#34;not-so-fresh from the freezer&#34; look to them and tasted the same. They were plopped on top and, from what I was told, tasted horrible. She got a to-go box to put the majority of the food in and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s still in the car or in a garbage can. 
I didn&#39;t know you could go wrong with noodles and cheese. It was a sad day."

Very nice looking and feeling place with a very friendly and helpful staff (Brooke was particularly great).  The menu has exactly the kind of food I want to have available for breakfast and has a variety of well-thought-out options.

The coffee was very good for my tastes (balanced enough for me to drink it black), and came in a personal-sized carafe for refills on-hand.  My server also offered a to-go coffee with my check.  They have a wide selection of juice blends that I will have to try on a future visit.

I ordered the country fried steak, which was perfectly cooked and had a nice, crisp lightly-seasoned breading.  It came with 2 eggs (cooked exactly as ordered), hash browns (nice and crispy outside, softer potato-y inside), and a really good biscuit and gravy.  The sausage gravy on the biscuits was also on the steak, and it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly smooth with little bits of sausage, and had just enough pepper to flavor but not overpower it.  The biscuit under the gravy was good overall, somewhat fluffy and not too dense, but the best part was that it was split in 2 and lightly grill toasted on the inside of each half, making for a wonderful textural contrast.

I&#39;m a corned beef hash fan, and their menu specified that it was house-made, so I had to try it as well, and it did not disappoint.  The corned beef was in nice, varying-sized shredded chunks with the occasional delectable flattop-caramelized piece, and it was mixed with chopped fresh green peppers, slightly translucent onion, and potato chunks.  All of the flavors melded so well and the freshness of the just-warmed-through peppers really popped.

Will absolutely come back again and explore more of their menu."

So &#34;no thank you I&#39;ll have the dish I ordered.&#34; Returns with the second chance meal, as my friend is finishing her meal, with a steak skillet, steak overdone again and rubbery and this time added cheddar, but yay broccoli is the only green veg.

My all time reason for no return to any business, is when I get admonished by staff or management, that I should know their rules, practices, or their training!!! I hate it n bye!

The interior is still classy and cozy though--Tiffany glass light fixtures in the side/lower level dining room I was in and chandeliers in the larger, higher ceilings rooms.

The staff was friendly and attentive and we were quickly attended to. I ordered chicken and waffles, she had the avocado toast. Serving size is definitely a hearty portion.

We ate here for Sunday brunch and sat on the patio. I realize when you decide to sit outside at a restaurant you MIGHT get slightly slower service, but we definitely felt a bit forgotten by our waiter. She was extremely pleasant, but didn&#39;t seem available when we needed her for refills and such. Also the umbrella over our table kept spinning, keeping half of us in harsh sunlight. We asked for someone to help fix the problem and our waiter said she would get someone, but never did. 

My mom ordered the fried green tomato Benedict and my dad and I each ordered a cheeseburger. Our meals were plentiful and a very good value, coming with a crock of soup each along with fries, but the meat in the burger was definitely low quality and didn&#39;t taste very good, not to mention they made an error with my dad&#39;s burger (wrong cheese). Admittedly they were willing to change out the burger immediately because of the mistake, but it was one extra issue. My mom said her meal was fine, but the fried green tomatoes were quite small for the price.

I&#39;ll give this spot one extra shot, but probably not for a while. The staff are certainly friendly and I&#39;m sure the breakfast dishes are quite tasty, but there are just so many good breakfast joints in the area, SB&#39;s really has to shine to stand out."

The hubs opted for his go to also, corned beef hash and eggs, he couldn&#39;t even finish it. It just wasn&#39;t very good. I got some soup to try a little something else from them. Cream of chicken and rice, but alas. No flavor there either."

Coffee was terrific, they leave you the carafe. Server was so nice and accommodating! Breakfast portions were massive. I got breakfast tacos which had a nice spicy sauce over eggs and chorizo with pico de gallo. My wife got a caprese toast special with perfectly poached eggs over pesto and mozzarella on toast. Both were great. Will definitely be back!"

My son had Mickey Mouse pancakes, which he enjoyed. My husband had the Irish Eggs Benedict, which he said was quite tasty (even if the hash was in giant chunks, so a little difficult to put on top of an English muffin). I had the Gouda omelette, which was too giant, but tasty. I thought it was a little weird that the avocado was cooked into the omelette, but overall it tasted quite good. 

Here&#39;s the only issue with Southern Belle&#39;s - it&#39;s yet ANOTHER breakfast/lunch-only spot in town. We really didn&#39;t need to have another one of those (with Canteen, Bread Basket and Egg Harbor - not to mention Cook Street Coffee, Spring Donut, and Starbucks - all within walking distance). If someone was a little more observant, they would&#39;ve put a restaurant that offered dinner (even a casual diner dinner) in that location since that&#39;s what we really need in town."

Went to the unhealthy side and had the biscuits and gravy with poached eggs. Very good. My bride had the Irish skillet and loved it. The southern theme is refreshing. The menu choices were great transcending the typical breakfast selections with southern and fusion choices. 

We were seated immediately.  The staff was friendly and welcoming. The service was good. The prices are comparable to Egg Harbor but a better value with more generous portions. No way we could finish and it was worth taking the leftovers home. 

Looking forward to exploring more on the menu especially the healthy choices. We will definitely be back."

I was in town visiting an old college roommate. We decided to give this place a try.  He said he had eaten there before, but there was a bit of a wait as they were very busy the last time he was there.  We arrived in between breakfast and lunch, so there were no issues with a wait.

Let&#39;s get to the important stuff.  The food was abundant and DELICIOUS.  I am a pretty big guy, and I have a healthy appetite - well, it&#39;s probably not that healthy, but I can pack it away.  This breakfast was seriously huge.  I loved every bite, but I couldn&#39;t finish my breakfast.  I think that&#39;s a first.  I can&#39;t even think of anything that could be improved.  I am actually glad I live 2,000 miles away because if I lived around the corner, I would eat here every day, and I could afford to lose a few pounds.

I am not familiar with any of the other breakfast places in town, but if you just went here every day, you would not go wrong."

Tip: this place doesn&#39;t do well when they get busy. We called ahead and still waited 45 mins with two toddlers (that was fun...) and almost left. After being seated outside as this was first available, it was just too hot... The metal chairs were burning my kids. So they were able to find us a table inside which was nice of them to organize that. They brought the kids food out first to help and said ours would be out in 3-5 mins. 10/15 mins later the food came and my wife&#39;s biscuits were not fully cooked inside - but burned on the bottom. They must have put biscuit dough on hot pans or something... They comped us the biscuits and gravy meal and apologized, but I just feel like that shouldn&#39;t have happened. A breakfast restaurant called &#34;southern belle&#39;s&#34; should be able to properly make biscuits. I will stress though, we were here before during a weekday and the service and food were spectacular. My recent poor experience won&#39;t hinder me from visiting again, but I definitely won&#39;t try to come here on a busy weekend - especially with hungry kids."

My family and I came in around 10:30 on Father&#39;s Day morning. We called ahead to put our party down, and they said it was currently a 15 minute wait. The frustrating part was despite calling ahead, we still had to wait around 20-25 minutes. We were a little annoyed because we called ahead and hoped we could get right in. The menu was very unique and had so many choices. My family and I all struggled trying to pick something out because everything sounded very good!  I got the Southwestern eggs Benedict and it was probably the best breakfast I&#39;ve had in a long long time!!!  My family also all enjoyed their meals.

My first experience here was definitely 5 star quality. The server was attentive and very chipper. The food was delicious and surprisingly fast. I couldn&#39;t wait to go back again...

My second experience was a one star experience, the doors were open making it cold, it was Mother&#39;s Day and the food didn&#39;t come out together. In fact we waited for 45 minutes for half of their of to come out then another 20 minutes for the rest of the food, including my moms! It was Mother&#39;s Day, nobody wanted to eat before she got her food. By the time she got hers the rest of the food was cold. Poor timing. They blamed it on the fact that what I ordered was gluten free. It was a wrap, bland, over cooked chicken, no dressing on it like it was suppose to, along side a soup I didn&#39;t order that was clearly NOT gluten free. I lost my appetite at the thought of eating gluten (I have an allergy)    

Thanks for comping my dish, I won&#39;t be going back."

It was maby 5-6 other tables there with people , but not many . My mom decided she wanted the table all the way in the back , so we were sat there. 5 min later the bus boy slammed 3 waters on the table ... Spilled them , so oh well , we cleaned it up . Menus were sticky and specials were even more sticky . Well we thought maby morning was super busy . 10 min later we still don&#39;t get greeted by anybody , so we try to move to another table to be noticed . We got send back and we were informed that server is on the way . Ok . We wait ... And wait and wait ... And 25 min later we decide this is not ok . We should get up and leave . So we did . Same lady at the door was shocked we were leaving and said she told a one of the servers to &#34; pick up&#34; our table . Well , too late . Egg Harbor is across the street . We went there . Had a great time , wonderful atmosphere , fantastic food and absolutely great service . We will not come back .

This place can take pride where others cannot. Compare for yourself: Sweet &amp; sour Shrimp, Chow Fun (any kind) and Shrimp  with lobster sauce. you will see they don&#39;t resort to &#34;institutional&#34; frozen foods! I know of a couple of places that use black bean in their sauce, but they still don&#39;t match the truly correct way it is done here. Flavors here take me back to Chinese restaurants of my youth. Modern places today are good, but may not even be &#34;Chinese&#34; at all. They have their strengths though, see my other reviews : )"

The person at the counter was very nice, made ordering a pleasure. They really stuff a large portion of food into the containers- a &#34;small&#34; order is really two meals for the average person.

The only negative I can think of is that they do not have a lighted sign- I had been to this plaza several times and never noticed that they were even there. It&#39;s a pity because I would think a lighted sign might just get them more business.

Well worth trying if you have a taste for Chinese take out."

They&#39;re a small place for take-out only, but it&#39;s totally worth it if you&#39;re looking for good take-out Chinese! Their orange kitchen is really different than any other orange chicken dishes I&#39;ve had... It&#39;s has more real orange flavor than the sweet, almost sickly sauces that I&#39;ve had on other orange chicken. I also would recommend the Mongolian beef; it&#39;s really tender and adds to your dish. The orange chicken is served on this bed of rice noodles or something, which are edible but I wouldn&#39;t suggest eating it. I think it&#39;s more fluff than anything. Their fried rice is the right amount of moist just like their white rice is. Their egg rolls are really greasy but perfect if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for. After a while of eating this, we had to lay off because we kept ordering the same thing all the time, but that doesn&#39;t affect my appreciation for the food they make here!"

Yes it worth every penny.

We just moved in to this neighborhood not very long ago and trying to look for some local easy dinner the other day. I was discouraged a little bit when I saw the size of the restaurant. But the food was surprisingly delicious. We tried orange chicken and beef chop suey. Chicken was a little bit over sweet for our taste but very crunchy and chunky which we love. Beef was very tender and flavorful. Also the owners are very friendly and pleasant. 

I personally believe this place is a solid 4 stars or even 4.5 and I do recommend everyone who likes real Chinese food come here and give it a try. (I&#39;m from China originally)

The restaurant accepted a reservation, and we didn&#39;t have to wait for everyone to arrive before being seated. The server was very friendly and extremely attentive.  Our food came out very fast and everything that I saw was VERY large portions and most entrees under $10.  I had the Denver skillet, it took up the entire oval-shaped plate and it was piled high.  I took more than half of it home, as it also came with a side of toast or pancakes.  The main event that others seemed to rave about was the ham - and it looked fantastic.  They serve very thick pieces and again a very generous portion. The only thing that was a smaller portion, was the biscuits and gravy.  I was a little surprised as it came out on a small plate.  It looked good, though!  

There are a lot of tables and booths, but it&#39;s sort of separated into two sides, so it isn&#39;t too loud in there.  It was a very mixed crowd and a comfortable and casual atmosphere.  They also had some &#34;bar&#34; type seating, which I imagine would be good for single diners. Water was on the table before I arrived and was refilled very quickly throughout the duration of our time there.  There was no hassle whatsoever for separate checks.  The parking lot was spacious, however, there were not enough spots to accommodate everyone when the restaurant was full.  Some people had to park on the street around the corner. 

Everyone who worked there was friendly, checked on us and asked how we liked the food, gave us all boxes when they noticed we were done. It was seriously one of the best first-dining experiences I&#39;ve had in a while.  Credit to the owners/management, they have a really good thing going here."

They advertise the king size slice of ham, and they are right!  I&#39;m not a real ham lover, but this was outstanding.  I ordered the #4 breakfast which was a giant slice of ham, 3 eggs, and 3 full slices of french toast. It was under $8 and excellent.  I took ham and french toast home.
The service was outstanding and friendly.   Our coffee cups were filled promptly with a smile and they remembered who had decaf and who had regular.
We will definitely be back again!"

Meat Lover&#39;s Skillet was amazing, with four, yes four eggs on top.  Unlike most places, where they serve a skillet meal in a small skillet, Mr. A&#39;s must make theirs in a 12 inch skillet and then serve it on a platter.  It&#39;s HUGE!

Service was excellent also.  Our waitress, Allie, was friendly, had a great sense of humor and a lot of patience.

We look forward to our next breakfast at Mr. A&#39;s."

I had a Ruben sandwich (only because I wasn&#39;t certain it was the same owners) and it was great. Service was outstanding. Servers were attentive without hovering over you. When we were close to finishing our meal our server came over, handed me the bill and said &#34;No hurry. Take your time.&#34; How many times have you heard that before, right? Well, this server actually seemed to mean it. 

Overall great food, great staff, and a nice clean, modern interior. They&#39;re only open for breakfast and lunch.

By the way, the original restaurant was famous for it&#39;s ham-on-the-bone. Next time, which will be soon I&#39;m getting the ham &amp; eggs!

I got a turkey club (the presentation was beautiful) with the home made fries (which are seasoned and just delish) and tried the cream of chic soup. Which was creamy and the chic in it is moist and fresh. 

My father had the biscuits and gravy and let me steal a bite. I honestly can&#39;t wait to get a plate of my own. 

The only bad thing I can say is the food is soooo delicious I wish I could keep eating until it was all gone but I can&#39;t because the portions are so generous."

Considering how busy they were, they were doing their best to keep up. I&#39;m looking forward to trying lunch.  I wish they were open for dinner.

everything each time was dry and not hot!

Interrupted our conversation constantly with her questions about us, our agenda for day, etc. We had not been together for year and wanted to catch up. Just a question about food or coffee refills would have been fine. We don&#39;t need their life history!  I&#39;m not kidding, interrupted every few minutes throughout our stay.

These guys have earned each of the 5 from me based on the fact that every single item I&#39;ve got from there in like 10 trips has been damn good. Here&#39;s a rundown. 

Lasagna: shut up and try it. 
Pizza: thin crust is delicious. Sauce is sweet, but hey, it must be a signature thing
Chicken Wings: dude, they are huge. U can make a meal from 6 wings. Meaty as hell. 
Cheezy Fries: the girl on the phone convinced me once. Glad she did. 

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve had more items than these. 

As for the ppl here complaining about a guy smoking in the back, shut it. It&#39;s a small family owned place. Not Pizza Hut. I&#39;m an avid non-smoker and it didn&#39;t bother me. Nothing smells or tastes like cigs. These are real ppl who make real food."

Let me start off by saying the staff who answered the phone were not helpful. We placed the order 1 week in advance the package was for twenty people we only had about 17 so we were content with having plenty of food for everyone. (BE AWARE it is deceiving, it says it feeds 20 but once you question them on it they are real quick to change their story and definition of what twenty people look like.) The gentlemen who took my order reminded my 5 times that he was doing us a favor by delivering and we BETTER take care of the driver, we agreed of course we were never planning on not tipping the driver. Today was delivery day and apparently they don&#39;t know what 20 people look like. There was no way what they delivered would have ever fed twenty people.  We called concerned that they might have forgotten some trays but were rudely told that was a lot of food and if we need more we  can order and pay for more. Unsatisfied with this place. I have never been treated so rudely. We have corporate events and birthdays almost every month and are always catering from restaurants at least once a month.  We took a risk and tried a new restaurant this was a terrible experience. Food is bland and barely enough to feed ten let alone twenty. I cant believe we spent $237 dollars for something that we could have gotten somewhere else that valued their customers. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT."

I have never seen such unprofessionalism in my life!! The thing about dealing with a business is that even when the customer may not agree with certain business practices such as pricing or policies on delivery, it is about the customer service received from those who are representing the business that makes or breaks the experience. From the moment my colleague called this restaurant to place our order, the service has been distasteful. We placed a very large catering order for an event we held at work. The order was placed a week in advance to accommodate the restaurant and give them time to prepare. Placing the order was extremely interesting to say the least. The gentleman taking our order was rude and short. He made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by delivering and in doing so we better not stiff the driver. HOW INSULTING!?!?!?!?!  If that wasn&#39;t enough, after the food was delivered (delivery was on time and the driver was outstanding actually!) and we were able to see what our $237 had purchased us, it was just downhill from there. This was supposed to be a party package that fed 20 people. There was no way that was possible. We had to cut food in half in order to accommodate our group. They gave us a pan of ribs, pan of fried and baked chicken that looked as though it fed a party of 4 let alone 20!!! After our discovery, we gave the establishment a call back to explain that what we received no where equated to what we paid. The &#34;owner/manager&#34; went off. He told us that was we got was what we paid for and he was sure it fed 20. If there was more that was needed then we could call him back to order more. He attacked us immediately instead of addressing our concern with why we felt as though what we received wasn&#39;t what was promised. And if not to make matters worse, when my colleague took to Yelp to post her experience, the owner replied with &#34;I knew you were going to be a problem the moment you called&#34; SERIIOUSLY?!?! I have never dealt with such nastiness in a business owner in my life. I would not recommend this company/establishment to anyone. They are the worse with their customers."

While driving home from work and on a whim, I decided to have pizza for dinner. I stopped into a strip mall area. I am glad that it did!

As a walk-in, the young lady who took my order, informed me it was going to be at least 20 through 25 minute wait.  The next time I order from here that will be way too long (mainly because I will be greatly coveting with an eager desire for its completion)! What a solidly wonderful pizza! 

One of the best crusts I can remember. It was flaky and firm and but not like cardboard. It was rather light while being strong. The sauce is a little sweet for my personal  taste, but the garlic and hint of pepper give it just enough so it&#39;s not too sweet. The cheese is high-quality and you can tell. Very well melted and very good texture along with solid taste.

I ordered a meat lovers pizza;16 inch. The toppings were distributed just right, in my opinion. There was not a heaping mount of meat yet it was evenly distributed and you could taste a little of everything on every piece, in every bite. 

As a former pizza maker myself, I really have to give these people kudos. They do pizza right! I will return to this place again in the near near future. In my opinion a job well-done!"

I placed a pick up order and when I arrived the owner told me our pizza had burned to the bottom and he could not serve us it and that he was starting a new pizza right away. He then took off the pieces of pizza from the pizza he had burnt and gave us the pieces that were salvageable for no extra cost.We literally got 3/4 of a pizza free, so it a steal! While waiting, we nibbled on the free pizza while waiting for our new pizza to be done cooking. The owner talked to us and joked around which made the wait we had fun. 
The amazing customer service was only half of it! The pizza itself? It was amazing. It had a very light, flaky crust, but it still managed to hold the ingredients. The sauce was delicious, maybe a bit too sweet, but I add lots of hot pepper flakes. The pizza also reheats very nicely. I reheated it up today and tasted as good as the day we got it.

We keep trying new places at work in hopes of finding the real winner. Ding ding ding! We think we have found it.

They have amazing wings! They are full of meat, so moist and flavorful. The BBQ flavor on the wings is so incredibly tasty! Everyone at my company was in agreement that these were the best wings we have had on our quest for wings delivered. The regular flavor is just plain like chicken nuggies or naked wings. The mild was very mild with just a very slight hint of heat. I&#39;m super weak with spicy flavors and had no problem eating a couple of the milds. I didn&#39;t dare touch the inferno but I heard those weren&#39;t quite as spicy as they had predicted. Overall, great tasting wings!!!

We also got the breaded mushrooms which were ehhhhh...I think they were overcooked. We won&#39;t be ordering those again.

We will be ordering again this Friday from Villa Rosa and are going to try the cheese stick appetizer in place of mushrooms. I&#39;ll keep you Yelpers posted! :)"

However, I was glad to learn that the grocery chain and this location aren&#39;t related; think about your Yelp friends Mike S. and Mike G. they have the same first name, but probably aren&#39;t in the same family tree. 
[Note: no need to check your friend list for the Mikes, they&#39;re on there...I checked.]

Regardless, Dominick&#39;s Villa Rosa Pizzeria is my new pizza place. It&#39;s Yelp official. I have only eaten one pizza from here, so it&#39;s a bold statement, but I felt strongly about it. 
Not to down play the deliciousness of their pizza, but there isn&#39;t much else around for a quick, stop-on-the-way-home-from-work pizza place. The one I discovered closed, and DVRP was next on the list so I gave it a try and found it to be a success. The pizza itself was very good, even better than the place I mentioned that closed, what confused me was the name (which is why it wasn&#39;t initially first on my list). 
I really liked the sauce to cheese ratio, and the flavors were on point so it really hit home for being a nostalgic pie. We tried the sausage pizza which was/is/always will be a staple selection in pizza toppings with my family, but  I wouldn&#39;t mind trying some other options. I very much look forward to the trial and error process of determining what the best toppings are.....also, where do I sign up for that job?? I want to make that my career.

I will be back on the next &#39;pizza night&#39; aka: after the holiday season. One day I hope to call them up and tell them it&#39;s me, and ask for the &#39;usual&#39;."

Had a coupon for some meal deal. Came with pizza, wings, etc. 

Pizza was good. I love thin crust. A little greasy for me but still kinda good. 
Wings were...let me put this delicately, GROSS. They tasted like they were microwaved and the flavor was awful. 
Fries were soggy and sad looking. Not the best I&#39;ve had either. 

Overall, kinda pricey for just an ok meal."

I&#39;ve had the Italian beef, which is as good as Portillos, maybe even a tad larger in size.  The meatball sandwiches are also solid offerings.  Bread is fresh with a crispy crust.

I LOVE the spaghetti with meat sauce &amp; cheese stuffed shells with meat sauce! Full of flavor. Tastes home made. Not from a jar. 
The Mean Green Salad was a little disappointment. I expected more green- like spinach or at least more romaine. There was too much iceberg lettuce for how much it cost.

I ordered the roasted salmon with the ginger Marsala glaze sauce &amp; a side of homegrown green beans absolutely fantastic. For dessert we opted for the homemade tiramisu one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. If you haven&#39;t tried Amore Mio, this place is worth the drive!

We hadn&#39;t been here in a while and went last night with another couple. Service was SLOW (they had more bus people than wait staff) and it was 6pm and not full. The food was mediocre and both the prosecco and the sauvignon blanc were awful. The prosecco had obviously been open for a while or was watered down or both - not chilled, no bubbles and awful flavor - like flat water - and cost $8 for a small glass. The sauvignon blanc was also old - yellowed - bleh. My husband got the salmon special - very bad - the sauce was overwhelming and sticky and the salmon wasn&#39;t fresh. Our friend got spaghetti and sausage - how can you mess that up? Dry! You have to pay extra to get a salad and the bruschetta appetizer they gave us was not fresh. I could smell it when they sat it on the table - ugh. The only good thing was the bread - it was at least warm and relatively fresh. They didn&#39;t offer to refill anyone&#39;s ice tea and the bus people kept trying to take things before we were ready as though they were rushing us out! We may not go back again even though they are so close in our neighborhood. There are better places for less money."

Our meals and salads were fantastic!  However, the service tonight was off, from checking in for our reservation (very confused hostess), to our server, who just seemed very uneasy with her job.

We rarely dine at restaurants without bars, as we like to have a drink at the bar before dinner.  However, we decided to take our daughter with us and just make it a family night out.

The drinks were great, despite the lack of bar.  My chicken dish (with goat cheese) was outstanding, but lacked presentation - chicken &amp; pasta, no green or addition of color.  My husband had the special, a phenomenal ravioli w/ sausage &amp; beets, but his lacked presentation, as well - just ravioli &amp; sauce.  My daughter loved her fetuccini Alfredo, but, again, just noodles &amp; sauce, no flair.

Cappuccino was great, dessert was tasty. They comped both, for service.  Not necessary, but appreciated.

We&#39;ll be back because the food was outstanding, but if presentation matters to you, you&#39;ll be a bit disappointed.  If you like good Italian food, you&#39;ll be more than pleased!"

Their chicken parmesan was basically a piece of unmarinated tasteless chicken with a thick coating of cheese and then tomato sauce smothered on. It was flavorless and not worth $17. I could&#39;ve made better. My friend ordered the Ciambotto and yes it did smell really good, but it was tasteless. 

The upsides to this place, complimentary bruschetta/bread/butter. Service was really nice. The ambiance was very on the romantic side. And their cuts of meat were good and fresh."

First off, it can be tricky to find - it&#39;s in a strip mall basically next to a Jewel so you have to look for it.   Parking was easy and in we went to place.   

We walked in around 5:45 PM on a Saturday and were fortunate to get the last available table.   We were greeted by a friendly waitress who gave us a rundown of the menu and complimentary bruschetta.   We also had fresh bread and olive oil to dip it in at the table.   

We started with an appetizer of tuna caprese - sashimi grade tuna served with avocado, jalapeno, spicy mayo on top of a fresh tomato.   Just awesome.   

Shared a caesar salad which was fine, but was missing croutons - that would have taken the salad up to the rest of the meal.

For dinner, shared a salmon filet served with a lemon wine sauce.  The fish was cooked perfectly and was perhaps the best seafood dish I&#39;ve had in years. 

For dessert, had both a canolli and tiramisu - both were made in house and as good as any italian place I&#39;ve been at.

Overall, I loved the meal and the service definitely pushed it to 5 stars for me."

First off, an important thing to know is that they are only open for dinner. They are a smaller restaurant, so it is a very warm and cozy atmosphere. It is very quiet with some soothing Italian music in the background. I would rate this between formal and casual, it could really go either way. I would come here on a nice date.

Their service is outstanding. We never went without food or drink. They have a great wine selection. The food is sophisticated, presented beautifully, and dances on the tongue. One word to describe it was incredible. There wasn&#39;t one thing I didn&#39;t like. It is truly one of the best restaurants I have been to in the suburbs."

I mean, the bruschetta was tasty as always, but the price went UP. I ordered the Vitello Marsala, which has veal, vegatables (carrots and mushrooms) and some pasta on it. I feel the chef used way too much wine for the sauce, so it&#39;s probably really tasty for people that are used to wine and alcohol, that would be my only complaint.

To conclude, this isn&#39;t my place. If the price went down and the quality and taste of food went up I&#39;ve definitely come back since I used to come here a lot. I wonder if the owner changed?"

We were the first and only customers at 5 pm on a weekday.  The restaurant had no mussels for either our appetizer or entrees.  The waiter forgot our substitute appetizer.  (How do you forget the appetizer for your only diners?)  When reminded, the waiter - our entree dishes in hand - asked if we still wanted it.

Upon being seated, we were promptly assured that the restaurant had gluten-free pasta, so we both ordered spaghetti.  What we got was rotini.  Upon inquiring, we were told that&#39;s the only gluten-free pasta they had.  We should have been told that up front.  We wanted spaghetti - not rotini!

We might as well have opened a can of Franco-American.  The pasta was limp and the sauce was tasteless.  (My wife remembers the sauce as being pink.) The decor is a mix of nondescript tables and ceiling fixtures that were slapped together with no design, unity, or interest.  The lack of interest the owner has in the restaurant is obvious.  Whatever his or her &#34;amore mio&#34; is, it doesn&#39;t seem to be this place."

The food is fantastic (especially the pear salad and the tomato cream sauce), the service is typically good, and they do carry out as well.  The restaurant itself is nice, but given the size and location, it can be a bit noisy when busy, and there are only a few tables in the place.  I would definitely recommend it in spite of those things, because the food really is fantastic."

It was our 1st visit but I don&#39;t think we&#39;d go back unless someone else wanted to go. The drinks were not up to par at $11 for a Lemontini. The service was not what I expected for the price of the food. The food was good but not great. I had veal picata. At MP (market price) for the veal I expected it to melt in my mouth but it was a little chewy. They were in a hurry to clear us out because of table turn over I guess I felt rushed. So I&#39;d say don&#39;t travel to get to Amore Mio..glad we tried it For the yelp folks .

Prices are $15-$22 per plate plus salads $8-$11 and some great appetizers too $8- $12.  I recommend the fried zucchini blossom.  Classic italian that doesn&#39;t leave you feeling like you ate too much!   Great place for a quiet date or small group.  Will totally be back!!"

I am first generation Italian American and extremely picky about Italian food, bIy far there are more places I don&#39;t enjoy than I like.  What most Americans expect in Italian food is big pasta portions for cheap prices and standards like chicken Parmesan. That&#39;s not real Italian food and not very imaginative but what I mostly find in Italian restaurants catering to Americans. Amore Mio is an exception.  They use only they freshest ingredients including a lot of vegetables and herbs they growth themselves.  Their prices are reasonable for the quality of the food and recipes created. If you like pasta sauce out of a jar avoid this place - you won&#39;t appreciate the real quality of what they do.  Mangia."

It&#39;s a super cozy, modern little restaurant tucked into a strip mall (shocker - everything is housed in a strip mall in the burbs).  Don&#39;t blink or you might miss it.  My friend had been here before but it was my first visit, and I&#39;m so glad she chose it!  The wait staff was wonderful and friendly, made a point to tell us that there was no rush and we could take as long as we needed.

We were served two pieces of bruschetta type bread with tomato, garlic and parmesan to start (didn&#39;t order it, they just brought it) - delicious.  We ordered a bottle of the Mark West Pinot Noir; so good.  We shared the salmon and a caprese salad, both of which were excellent and plenty to share.  

Overall, the cozy ambience and superb service will definitely bring me back to Amore Mio.  If you find yourself anywhere near this place and hungry, please visit!"

- The food was DELICIOUS.  Needed a bit of salt, but probably better to leave it less salty and allow people to add whatever amount suits their own taste.  I had eggplant parmesan and my husband had something on the specials menu- pork something.  Both were REALLY good.
- Portions were HUGE.  I got three meals out of my eggplant parmesan.
- The ambiance is REALLY well done- it&#39;s a very pleasant place to be.

The less than great parts:
- Our server was a bit flighty... but at least she was nice.  It was a bit hard to flag her down, even though it looked like she only had two tables.
- It&#39;s a wee bit loud in there.  We sat in a table against the wall, and you can definitely hear the conversation of the table sitting next to you loud &amp; clear.

The pasta is cooked al dente (always the best indicator of a good Italian restaurant) and the fish and meat dishes that we have tried have been fresh and excellently prepared.  I really like the drapes that divide each table for maximum privacy.   I am beginning to think this is the local restaurant I have been searching for since moving back to the Chicago burbs 6 years ago.

There were only 2 ladies covering the entire room and they performed with timely precision.
I am from New England and I am a snob when it comes to ordering seafood. As a rule I never order seafood unless I can see the ocean. Hoffman Estates, IL is a far cry from the Atlantic but I decided to try the seafood special with shrimp and clams. I was very pleased with the dish and of the freshness of the seafood. The sauce was light and complimentary. I look forward to my next visit."

Me and my girlfriend went here for dinner. The place was pretty easy to find. The place is very small, but kind of cute. However, I often found myself getting bumped a lot by the waiters who were trying to pass behind me. 

The service was pretty disappointing. At pretty much every Italian restaraunt I&#39;ve been to, they serve the bread with cheese and olive oil. However, here they only gave us the bread and the cheese. It wasn&#39;t a big deal so we just asked for the olive oil. The waiter seemed annoyed by the question and brought it out. 

The food came out in a decent time my girlfriend and I shared the Farfelle. It was a bit bland and a little dry, but the portion was pretty normal for an Italian restaraunt. The prices here are a bit higher than most restaraunts, but it wasn&#39;t unreasonable I suppose.

After we were done eating, it took about 10 more minutes for our waiter to come out with the check. I would understand if it was a big, busy restaraunt but this place is tiny so I&#39;m not sure what took the waiter so long. The reviews promised a lot, but I wasn&#39;t very impressed at all."

The food is the worst Italian I have ever had, besides the price can not be justified for the quality of the food. Most entrees are 16 to 21, not expensive per se, but the quality offered does not justify it. 

We ordered spaghetti and meat ball, pork tenderloin , fettuccine With peas and pancetta, and a salad. 

The meat in the pork tenderloin is not fresh.  Besides, the pork is under seasoned. It tastes bland. The worst part is it is over cooked. It is tough and dry. The potato wedges came along with the dish were not properly fried. The skin was not crispy. 

The sauce of the fettuccine is light, which is okay for me. However, the pasta itself did taste dead. It did not have the right balance of chewy and elasticity. I don&#39;t know whether they were hand made or not. It seems to me the dough was under kneaded. 

We did complain about the pork, and the manager agreed to take back the dish. We then ordered spaghetti and meat ball. Apparently , they didn&#39;t saut√©ed the meatball and they tasted dry.  The sauce also lacked the taste of herb and garlic. 

Finally, they do serve you a free appetizer, bruschetta, in their interpretation. Lazy job is all I can say. Tomato not diced, no garlic rubbed on the bread. I just stop here. 

In summary, the restaurant offers nothing for the food. The food is not authentic, not even cooked appropriately. 

I would like to see the chef to go to Gordon Ramsay&#39; show to get the justice done."

As soon as you enter the doors you forget that you are in a strip mall and you just embrace the experience.

I think I&#39;m personally biased to Italian food.  Since it&#39;s the most common; I just find it hard to be impressed I think...anyways

Ambience:  very cute and quaint, I showed up in a t shirt and shorts...I felt like a scrub.  The clientele is a bit more mature and sophisticated than I anticipated.  Not that that should deter you from dressing casually; but you wouldn&#39;t want to detract from the enviroment, either.

Service: Great service here, the old man...maybe he&#39;s the owner; he&#39;s a great guy; and the hostess was cute...tee hee

Food:  I ordered the Cavatelli Abbruzzi (spicy pasta dish) which was pretty good, though not amazing.  The pasta tasted particularly good, probably since they make it in house.  The other aspects of the dish were average.

Overall: good service, good ambience; food is definitely better than most italian restaurants..but still lacked that &#34;wow&#34; factor"

The owners are all in the family, including the Hostess Manager (or Front of House Manager), and her husband, the Executive Chef.  The owner (a great old Italian Papa) comes out of the kitchen to wait on you himself, or to check on you.  He loves to talk shop, or leave you be if that&#39;s what you want.  Everyone is happy, friendly, and loves to educate you about the menu.  When you go, ask them if they have any of the special (not always listed on the menu) Pumpkin Ravioli - the best of its kind that I&#39;ve ever had.  And I know my pumpkin ravioli!  It&#39;s tiny, in a shopping strip mall (next to the Jewel Osco and behind the Oberweis), but the inside is pretty.  Great for a date.  Great for families or groups, too.  The food is phenomenal.  You feel like you&#39;re eating at an Italian family&#39;s kitchen.  You can&#39;t go wrong.  If they don&#39;t have the pumpkin ravioli, don&#39;t worry.  Try the Baked Portobello mushroom, gorgonzola cheese, sundried tomato and spinach Antipasti.  Try the Caprese Salad (so fresh).  Try the Veal Ravioli special, or the Gnocchi, Cavetelli, Meat Lasagna, Chicken Marsala, Chicken Salsacaldo, Tilapia &amp; Shrimp, Baked Salmon, or Veal Paremsean (or anything, really, anything).

Try the Lemon sorbet - amazing.  Or any other desserts.  The specials are wonderful too."

We started ordering from here right after they opened.  In all those years we had only done carry-out since we live so close and the kids were young.  Now we ocassionally dine in and walk to it.  The food has always been very good.  We love that it is a family run business, and are very happy that the restaurant has done so well here.  I love the fact that it is a nice cozy restaurant within walking distance of my home.


My only negatives are: Because we sometimes ordered once a week, we found that their &#34;specials&#39;&#34; don&#39;t seem to change very often or as often as we would like.  It became very frustrating calling all the time to hear about the same or similar 3 ravioli specials.  Or about the fish special that is actually on their regular menu.  I like ravioli, but 3 on one nights &#34;specials&#34;, why not 1 or 2 and some  other pasta choices? As with most places, the meals got smaller and the prices went higher.  Wish they would put some of their original dishes back on the menu, like Shrimp Basilico, or salmon with mushroom risotto.

All in all I would definetly recommend."

I had a ravioli in tomato cream sauce that was incredibly good, and my husband had the Ciambotto, which was way more food than he could eat, but good enough that he made me try a bite of everything (and he normally doesn&#39;t like to share!). The atmosphere felt really comfortable, but nice enough that it made for a good date night out for us.

Arrived there on a Saturday afternoon(about 130ish), and the owner stops us at the door saying &#34;they don&#39;t up til 4 pm&#34; and of course we were dissapointed that we came all the way from Brookfield to give it a try, and he &amp; his family welcomed us in with open arms, and insisted we dine then!!! That in itself was just so admirable, and so welcoming, I just knew this was going to be a wonderful experience! I have worked in this business long enough to know genuine hospitality, and many do not know it...

We had an AMAZING experience from the moment we walked in til we left, and talked about it the whole way home! We had bruschetta, ceasar salad, zuppe de peshe with linguine, tiramasu, &amp; a cappacino to DIE for...BTW, I was a Starbucks Manager, so I KNOW good coffee/espresso!


The bruschetta was a beautiful display, and melted in your mouth...
The ceasar salad was crisp, fresh greens, and FRESH parmesean...
The zuppe de peshe was absolutely...there isn&#39;t even words to describe how good this was baby clams, mussels, shrimp, &amp; scallops atop perfected &#34;al dente&#34; linguine, with a light marinara-white wine sauce...
The tiramasu was homemade, and perfected not to stiff, nor to wet!
The cappacino was perfected with a vanilla creme addition!

I know I am going on &amp; on, but finally getting to my point...I think besides the fact that this was GREAT food, the family was the best part! They are very happy to be doing what they do, and you can clearly see this. They open their door to the restaurant before business hours because they wanted to welcome us in. They spoke to us for hours like we were friends of the family for years, and it was VERY touching. Their grandmother, I believe her name to be Katherine was just a hit, and touched our hearts immensely...she sang &amp; danced  &amp; spoke Italian to us so beautifully. I will make a point to drive there on a regular basis for as long as they are there!!! They made a die hard customer, not sure they know this yet, but they did!

JOB WELL DONE...TONY, TAWNY, MOM &amp; POPS, AND BEAUTIFUL NONNIE!!! I WISH YOU ALL THE SUCCESS IN THE WORLD, EACH OF YOU DESERVE EVERY BIT OF IT! TIL NEXT TIME..."

Amore Mio is, in my opinion, the best Italian restaurant within a 10 mile radius of Algonquin.  The menu stands out; it has just the right mix of unique and traditional dishes.  The food is always cooked to perfection.  Flavors are memorable and nothing like traditional boring cookie cutter Italian restaurants that use too much cheese and sauce that overpowers the pallette.  The service is excellent.   I love the quaint ambience that is so hard to find in the suburbs.   We have been regular visitors over the years.  I have never been disappointed at Amore Mio."

It seems like a family business of some sort, but that could have been our imagination.  I did hear what sounded like a strong Italian accent coming out of the kitchen, and I&#39;m pretty sure that was Grandma.  In any case our food was excellent, and the wait staff was very attentive."

But Amore Mio is one of the finest Italian restaurants I&#39;ve ever been too. Its extremely authentic in its simplicity. Unlike a lot of modern Italian places, it doesn&#39;t overwhelm you with oversized portions. Also the authentic feel you get is immediately felt. I&#39;ve eaten in hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Italy with greta food, and this is the closest I&#39;ve ever been to that. I&#39;ve eaten here probably 10+ times and all the servers are the same and treat you extremely well. I can&#39;t say a bad thing about Amore Mio accept that it is a true gem hidden in the suburbs."

We started with the appetizer of grilled calamari over spinach.  I would order it as the main dish.  It tasted like the ocean, and was so tender.  Salad was a a balsamic vinagrette over crisp fresh sping mix.  Light and refreshing.  The Zuppe di Pesce was cooked tender, flavorful, and al dente.  Risotto was well done.  Pork tenderloin was mouth watering, and well seasoned.  Finally, the last dish was the homemade pear tart.  OMG, wonderful.  Bottom line - great italian food is simple preparations, great groceries, and cooked with lots of love.  This family owned restaurant has all those factors and more.  Great dinner."

Most places were either closed or closing soon, but Rosati&#39;s had longer hours so they won. 

We ordered a pizza for delivery. At first we were going to order online, but they were going to charge an online fee (?!?!), so we decided to order over the phone. When we ordered over the phone, we noticed there was a price difference (besides the online fee) for the pizza we wanted. That was odd. 

I think they are so overpriced for what you get. A small margherita pizza was almost $30. That&#39;s insane. The pizza was good, but I could probably get a frozen pizza that would be just as good for wayyy cheaper. It&#39;s just craziness. Needless to say, I&#39;m not really a fan, but the pizza itself isn&#39;t terrible. I&#39;ve never been to the actual location so I can&#39;t vouch for that."

This review is for Rosati&#39;s, but, I wanted to make a mention that this was one of my first orders through Eat24 and my order came before it was estimated (45 to 60minute estimate, but it arrived in about 33minutes)!  So, very fast delivery from Rosati&#39;s and their Eat24 connection works great!  I am about a 10 minute drive from their location, so that was super fast and awesome!

Now, for the food.  As I said I eat lots of pizza from all over the place.  I got their thin crust with sausage, pepperoni, &amp; green pepper. They sure don&#39;t skimp on ingredients!  Lots of cheese and lots of toppings!  All very tasty!  This was my first time ordering their thin crust, and my only complaint is that it isn&#39;t really that thin.  It&#39;s more like a kinda thinner hand tossed.  But, it was good!  Just know if you want a super thin crust, this isn&#39;t it.  I also got their wings in the hot sauce flavor.  Came with blue cheese and ranch.  They were again, good.

*Update.  I ordered by phone.  Large order with pizza, wings, potato skins, and chicken tenders.  I mentioned I had a coupon for free delivery.  Driver comes with all food, but, I looked at recipt and there was still a delivery charge.   The guy on the phone said he took that off after I clearly stated, &#34; I have a coupon for free delivery&#34;.  I gave the driver a $7 tip (wasn&#39;t drivers fault) and said, &#34;here take the coupon and get another $3 tip when the delivery charge is refunded&#34;.  I have to lower down to 1 star now.  Reason being the person who took my order clearly heard me say I had the coupon and responded saying, &#34;Ok I&#39;ll take off the delivery charge, your total is $xx.xx and it will be there in 45 to 60minutes&#34;.  He lied straight to me.  I will raise stars back up in the future if problems like this don&#39;t continue."

My cousin and I got an order of cheese fries, she ordered a philly cheese steak sandwich and I ordered a breaded chicken sandwich(really healthy, I know.)

Ordered @ 12am  and was given 45 min wait time --- 1am rolls around and still no show. I call Rosati&#39;s @ this point,and they are &#34;closed&#34; so no one answered. Another 30 minutes goes by ---no one here yet. FInally @ 145am -- 2.75 hours AFTER we ordered our food, the delivery guy arrives. He knew it was way over the time limit and said he was sorry w. a little laugh. 
Ok, well let&#39;s eat ----my cousins sandwich looked good and we split the cheese fries, which was good. Then I open up my sandwich and see a burnt bun w/ a black circle on top -- the chicken breast was almost black completely burned. Are u kidding me?!  Who in the heck in their right mind decided that could go out the door to a customer?  Oh yes someone who does not give a sH&amp;t and wanted to end their shift and get outta dodge.

I called Rosati&#39;s the next day and the manager automatically knew who I was when I mentioned the 2 hour wait and when I began to talk about the over cooked nasty chicken sandwich, she interrupted and said they were hit hard w/ a  lot of late orders and they cannot gauruntee the time Grub Hub gives ---and that she will credit me $4 so the next time I call them I can get a free chicken sandwich. Laughable I know - that they think that is going to satisfy a customer who experienced such horrible customer service. Do not go here.. you&#39;ve been warned."

Well I just pulled into town for company training last night. Flight was late, cabbie got a bit lost... Long ass train was crossing at the street we were trying to cross. Oh yeah did I mention it had just snowed...like a lot? Like two feet! 
Needless to say regardless of their cute advertisements, a Snickers bar was not going to change me from the cranky pissed off annoyed guy I was to normal in 2 bites. 
So I asked the desk jockey at hotel check in...
--Side bar-I thought there was a safety net for trainees aka a manager, co-worker, supervisor...mom!
This poor dude saw my angry ass at 10 pm. I must of looked like the troll dripping snot monster on Zicam commercials. He conversely looked like a prepubescent pimply faced bed wetter whose manager was apparently not in the same zip code and unable to help. And he was front and center with ...a life sized angry snot dripping troll like on the Zicam commercial.
I asked who on this dreary evening would venture forth into the Snow White abyss risking the cold, the dark, the danger of the streets of suburbia Chicago to deliver this ravenous soul a pizza?
His hand shook as he handed me the photocopied list of nearby restaurants that were open. 
--ok back on track that list was useless, fortunately I had Yelp with open now filter and badabing badaboom I found this place.
In spite of the snow, late hour, &amp; the cold, my zah showed up hot... Correct... And delicious!!!

He ordered a 16&#34; pizza with five toppings (which is called supreme pizza minus black olives) and was told each ingredient was $2.90 an ingredient.  He ordered and I went to pick up the pizza and saw that they charged me 5 x $2.90 in effect, charging me about $6.00 more than a supreme pizza and I got less ingredients!

 I asked for manager who said &#34; too bad.&#34;  Spoke with front counter person and again &#34;too bad.&#34;  then spoke to the &#34;owner&#34; and he said we didn&#39;t mention the words Supreme pizza so &#34;too bad!&#34;  

Possibly the worst example of customer service I have seen in a while.  Yes, he beat me out of $6 but I am telling everyone about this &#34;Supreme&#34; display of customer service. He will never get my business again and anyone I can convince not to patronize this establishment on Rowhling Rd in Elk Grove Village.

We actually ordered today and got the 14 inch, which was plenty for us (all spinach this time, yay!)!.  We also ordered the 1/2 shrimp dinner that came with about 9-10 delicious golden friend shrimp! So GOOD! It also comes with fries...this time it was seasoned fries which we really enjoyed!  This time I added a side salad (only $1.99), which was super tiny, but it was pefect for a little serving for each of us (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and red onions).  

They are always pretty fast with their delivery! Keep the menus because they have great coupons in there and great deals during the week!

About an hour after I received my order, I received a phone call from the restaurant that was harassing in nature.  Although I had successfully ordered, received, and been charged for my food via Grubhub and PayPal, the caller told me that delivery was not available through Grubhub. They asked me &#34;how do you plan to pay for this&#34; and got agitated when I explained I had already been charged.

I placed an order at 12:46pm and they confirmed they rcvd the order at about 1:20pm but I was advised it was already on it&#39;s way. I was understanding and said ok I will wait at least until 2:15pm considering the bad weather outside. So time passed and it was already 3:15pm and I had not heard anything or rcvd anything in regards to my order I called Rosati&#39;s and I spoke to a gentlemen and told him that I wanted to cancel my order because it was almost 3 HOURS! and all he said was &#34;Ok.&#34; 

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN!"

I used to order a Family Feast meal which included bread, pasta and family size salad.  I just ordered and my son picked up the order that did not include the salad.  I called and was pretty angry, but the manager wasn&#39;t there and cook did what he could to fix the situation.   I realize it&#39;s not the employees fault and wish I had been nicer about it.  Considering the family feast was the only attraction, I guess this is my last order."

I placed our order and it got here and our pizza looked like it had been dropped and when I called to complain the girl who answered the phone told me that they would send me a new pizza but we have to give them the old one. A deep dish pizza takes an hour to cook and I had no time to wait. When I asked to speak to a manager the girl told me he was in an accident and wasn&#39;t in. I then drove over to the rosatis to talk to the manager in person and he was there and he said there was nothing he could do for me. Terrible business. And I could have gotten better food out of the frozen food section the spending $30 here. Rediculouse I will never ever order from here again! If I could rate it 0 stars I would.

I accidentally ordered from this Rosati&#39;s instead of the one down the street from my office.  This one is actually closer to my house, so while I considered calling to cancel my order, I didn&#39;t want to be rude if the food was already cooked and I wanted to check this location out.  I wish I had called and cancelled anyways.  I ordered the buffalo chicken salad and the cheese fries.  The buffalo chicken salad was supposed to come with mozzarella cheese.  I assumed it would be shredded, but it looked like they ran out of mozzarella and took a slice of american cheese and ripped it into pieces and threw it in the salad instead.  The side of ranch dressing looked yellow rather than white.  There were huge slices of tomatoes, which aren&#39;t appealing in a salad.  The buffalo chicken was the thinnest chicken breast I&#39;ve ever seen in my life, which was disappointing since that was the only edible thing in the entire meal.  I also got an order of the bacon ranch cheese fries.  I&#39;ve ordered these from the Schaumburg Rosati&#39;s before, and they were really good.  They were seasoned, the cheese was a melted shredded cheese, the fries were thin like mcdonalds fries.  What I got was crinkle fries covered in nacho cheese with pieces of bacon here and there.  I don&#39;t like nacho cheese, and there was so much of it that I couldn&#39;t even try to pick around it to get clean fries.  This meal was a huge waste of money.  I thought I could have two meals out of this food, but instead I paid about $17 for the thinnest barely filling chicken patty I&#39;ve ever had.  The pizza looked like it might be good, but based on today&#39;s experience I will not be returning here."

From the black and white checked tile floor, to the myriad of James Dean, Elvis &amp; Marilyn Monroe posters and paraphernalia scattered on the walls, to the straight forward menu, you know this isn&#39;t Wildberry. And that&#39;s totally fine. That being said, the food and service are just that, totally fine.

As mentioned, the offerings are straightforward with a solid variety of egg dishes (omelettes, skillets, etc) and a handful of pancake, crepe and waffle options. They do have a few lighter breakfast options too, like egg white varieties and oatmeal. 

After we seated ourselves and grabbed some coffee it took our server quite some time to circle back around to take our order. And no, it wasn&#39;t busy (we were one of three tables at 8am on. Tuesday). Once we ordered, though, our food came out fairly quickly and I enjoyed my fresh strawberry crepes and a bit of sausage. The crepes and strawberries were basic but fresh as were the sausage links. Again, nothing remarkable, but a solid three star meal overall.

I went plain and simple with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and pancakes. It was just what you&#39;d expect and plenty of food for cheap. The service was great, too. The lady waiting on us was so nice.

And told us a guy came in yesterday with a free hugs shirt, she asked him where he got it, already forgot, and would make her own.

Owner came and took my mom&#39;s napkin, showing she wanted to clean off the table, and then came back and told us we could pay up at the front.

I&#39;ve been looking for places to go other than the usual boring joints that cost me at least $15 for lunch, which is ridiculous by the way...

I love Greasy Spoons, aka Diners, and this one is on my favorites list. I&#39;ve only been here twice, but the both times I&#39;ve come here the staff has been really friendly and when you first come in or check out after your meal, the young guy behind the cash register is always cracking jokes or making silly puns. It really makes your day. 

The wraps are a good portion size and it&#39;s no big deal if you don&#39;t want soup or want to substitute fruit for fries (they don&#39;t give you chunked up fruit, you get slices of cantaloupe, honey dew, pineapple and orange. 1 of each which I thought was odd, but i&#39;ll take that over combined fruit salad. lol) I want to eventually try their breakfast. 

I&#39;m saving the best for last....the price. I only paid $10 for a cup of coffee, a bowl of soup and a turkey club (which I ended up taking half home because it was a lot of food) It is well worth the lunch. And it may be only $5 less, but at least you walk out full. My only advice, is to get there before noon. I try to go around 11:30 if i&#39;m going there for lunch, because it does tend to fill up around 11:45-12pm. But it only took me a half hour to get my food and eat. I had a half hour of my lunch left to relax. :) Thanks Teddy&#39;s!"

Service wasn&#39;t great at all. What stood out was the fact that we sat for 20 minutes before getting silverware, and only after our food had arrived and we asked for it. Coffee was brought to us a few minutes after sitting, which is fine, but no cream was available until asked for, once again. 
I ordered the Fiesta Skillet, which be aware that it does have mushroom in it, if anyone is allergic or has an issue with mushroom (doesn&#39;t say this on the menu). But that&#39;s okay, because you wouldn&#39;t be able to taste it either way, just like the rest of the skillet. There was no flavor whatsoever, which is extremely disappointing and shocking considering it has onion, green pepper, onion, chorizo, and supposedly salsa. The &#34;hash browns&#34; had absolutely no flavor to them, which sucks because when one thinks of a skillet, they think of flaky, delicious hash browns. 
I&#39;ve seen a couple reviews regarding the portions that you are given, and let me just take care of that now. As far as any skillet portions, the serving bowl you get them in is tiny with a huge plate underneath, giving the illusion that there is much more food than there really is (but the amount of food doesn&#39;t excuse the absence of flavor). With other meals, the portions of whatever you get are spread out among the plate, perfect for those who HATE when their food touches, but still not an exceptional amount. Compared to Elly&#39;s Pancake House (where we should have gone), the portions are pathetic while the pricing remains the same.
Definitely will not be returning. I give this place a 1/10 due to ZERO difference from the other times I have been there, and was disappointed each time.
Apparently, I&#39;m a glutton for punishment."

This newer local breakfast spot has a classic faux look to it. ¬†It is 60s style with lots of check board and red plastic seating. ¬†So black and white and red all over. ¬†There are 6 booths, 8 tables and a counter top that faces an open kitchen. ¬†The chairs have shiny metal backs. ¬†The atmosphere is faux but not tacky.

The good
Old scool sugar instead of the packets. ¬†They did have packets of alternative sweeteners.

There was a fully staffed team that was prompt and thorough. ¬†I was even

The biscuits and gravy was tasty. ¬†Very good considering the fact that it is in a strip mall

The sausage links were fat and cooked well. ¬†Browned but not Burnt

The bad
No cream on most tables. ¬†Those that did had the little packets. ¬†If you are going to do the old school, do it all the way with cream pourer.

The coffee itself is a little weak. ¬†Cups made in China, I know but it is a pet peeve. ¬†

The bng came out within 10 min which means it was not prepared fresh. ¬†It was on the special so the gravy was probably made this morning. ¬†Not too bad.

Overall this place is good and not to hard to get to. ¬†I will say it was worth the trip. ¬†If you are driving by and looking for breakfast it is a must stop."

Make sure to look for the white board menu because sometimes there are hidden gems!"

The service has gone down to less than friendly. The portions are still large. Attention to detail in the kitchen has slipped: Both times, I ordered an omelet where the cheese &amp; filling were only in a quarter of the omelet. The coffee is undrinkable which I forget everytime I go there. Seriously, no matter how its doctored, it is so bitter and burnt you can&#39;t help to gag with each sip. Coffee is pretty important for a breakfast place. There is a chain just around the corner called Elley&#39;s that is so much better, Teddy&#39;s has lost me as a customer."

Minutes later, lady walks away with a bag full of ham bones, free of charge.

If you thought that was generous, wait until you see their portions!  My friend ordered a 2 egg + corned beef hash and you know what they brought out?  4 eggs!  I like that math!  I ordered from their specials (breakfast crepe filled with scrambled eggs, spinach, and bacon).  The crepe was slightly sweet but went well with the scrambled eggs, big chunks of bacon, and spinach.  Got two extra large crepes busting out with the filling.  Needless to say, I had leftovers for the next day!

Teddy&#39;s Diner is definitely a locals hang out where the waitresses know almost every customer walking through the door.  I even overheard a veteran waitress training a new one and introducing her to every regular.  Love the true diner feel, down to the white &amp; black checkered floor and cushy bar stools.  Their regular menu appears lacking but just set your sights on their dry erase board where you can order specials galore from a taco salad to a tilapia sandwich.  Yum!"

When three of us went for a late breakfast on a weekday, there were four other tables with customers. Two tables paid and left shortly after we were seated and the busboy delivered water. There were four waitresses on duty at the time. Two were working the dining room, one was writing specials on the board, and the other was behind the lunch counter. The two in the dining room never looked our way as they walked past our table to deliver food and checks. No one bothered to mention that our server would be with us shortly or offered to pour us coffee even though, at this point, we were one of three tables with customers.

After about 15 minutes, a few more customers arrived, were seated, and were already being waited on as we talked about going someplace else. Just as we stood up to make our exit, the waitress that had been writing on the board came over. Even though she apologized profusely and was very gracious and accommodating, it was clear that customer service and teamwork are not a priority at Teddy&#39;s. Several of our  waitress&#39; coworkers had walked past her numerous times while she was writing out the specials, but none ever mentioned to her that she had a table. Even the host, who took a seat at a table with some customers next to ours, was apathetic.

Had the restaurant been busy or short-staffed, the long wait would have been understandable. Too bad we won&#39;t be going back because the food is pretty good."
teddys-diner-elk-grove-village,Roman L.,fGCxADvMYmVGaQkXakDgxg,"Bartlett, IL",0,1,1,34,442,bSrK40dq2jdOhaDMznnpFg,3.0,2013-08-04,"I came to this place because 1) I love Breakfast 2) I like trying something new 3) good reviews and tips. 

Let me just start by the vibe of this place. There is pictures of Marilyn Monroe and a few of Elvis, so pretty much is a 50&#39;s 60&#39;s ambience. Also, the space is tiny so it fills up quickly specially if you go around 11 or 12, but luckily we didn&#39;t have to wait to long to be seated. 

Now I am going to talk about the service. As I was waiting, I saw one of the waitress handing something to a customer and accidently hit his cup and spilled a bit of it on the table and she didn&#39;t even bothered to clean it up. Later when we were already in our seats, we were seated right in front of the kitchen and you could see how everything was being cooked which I was concerned of the cooks washing their hands because they were using their bare hands to grab some food. Our waitress came and we placed our order I ordered the Hawaiian Skillet which was on their special board and when she asked how I wanted my eggs I told her pouched. So we waited and our food finally arrived, and right when she put my plate down she tipped the glass of water all over the table and I was fast enough to quickly move and avoid my clothes getting soaked wet and she left and didn&#39;t bother to say sorry or clean it up herself, other workers had to come and clean it up. Even after they were done cleaning up they left part of the booth wet so I had to dry it off myself.

The food: Okay so like I told you I ordered my eggs pouched and I looked at my skillet and said to my parents, &#34;didn&#39;t I asked for pouched eggs?&#34; and they answered &#34;yeah&#34; and what was on my skillet was fried hard cooked eggs, but I didn&#39;t bother to say anything because I didn&#39;t really care much and I was hungry so I wanted to eat. The skillet itself was very big for their prices and everything looked fresh which was nice, and even though the skillet had pineapple and jalapenos it lacked flavor something was missing to it maybe a little cheese might of fixed it. Anyways the food didn&#39;t taste bad, it lacked a bit of flavor but it wasn&#39;t bad but not good either so it was OK. 

Finally, when we got the check and I was shocked of the price. Probably the cheapest breakfast I have paid for. At the counter the guy asked me how was the food guys and my answered was &#34;It was good except my eggs were wrong I ordered pouched and got something different&#34; so the waitress heard me and she said why hadn&#39;t I said something and I was like cause I am not to picky like that and that&#39;s the truth I am not to picky when it comes to those kinds of mistakes. Anyway after my critic about the eggs the guy said well thanks for letting us know we always want to know our customers opinion, so just because of that incident im taking $8 dollars off so I paid $21 dollars for three meals so I was pleased."

My family and I frequent this cute diner any chance we get and you really can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu.

The skillets are loaded with toppings, the biscuits are buttery and the sausage gravy is chunky with a nice pepper kick, the flapjacks are fluffy, and the hashbrowns usually are nice and crispy.  Portions are huge and the prices are small!  Service can be hit or miss, but it really depends on how busy it is.  I prefer to get there before 8:30 before it gets crazy."

The number 1 thing I noticed about Teddy&#39;s that I don&#39;t find everywhere else is their quality of service. The staff here is super friendly, very happy, and ready to accommodate. Their menu is full of breakfast foods, sandwiches, soups, and salads. It&#39;s all that yummy comfort food we all love. I got the Chipotle Chicken Panini and the split pea soup. It was so good!

My Aunt and Uncle love Teddy&#39;s, and it really is cool that it feels like a proper diner when you walk in. We had a larger number than usual, so we sat in the corner and they were pretty happy to have us. We were served coffee right away (key) and were greeted by our server who was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. 

After the coffee kicked in I was able to see straight and order Eggs Benedict with hash browns. Since we had a bigger group, the hollandaise had set slightly when I was served then had to wait for everyone to get their dish before I began, I&#39;m polite, what can I say? This was one of the reasons why I almost gave 3 stars, but then I considered their perspective and realized it&#39;s tough to cook full breakfasts for large groups of people at the same time. 
Please don&#39;t get me wrong, it still tasted good, I just needed to get it off my chest I suppose. 
The other reason for the 3 star nomination was the fact that my plate never got cleared after the meal, I left it there when we exited. To their defense I was in the far corner and I just dont feel like that merits docking points from the rating; if it was a normal table with a few of us there I would have definitely rated low, but such was not the case. 

All negatives aside, we enjoyed ourselves, the atmosphere, and the coffee. It seemed like everyone else in the group liked their food based on the empty plates I saw as they left the table. The hash browns rocked, I definitely needed to address this somewhere in the review, so here it is...get them.

I&#39;ll be back if I&#39;m in the area for breakfast with my Aunt and Uncle, they apparently know Teddy and my Aunt&#39;s Mom has a crush on him...I guess he&#39;s a &#39;Hot Gyro&#39;.

My daughters food came out a full five minutes after mine, I was pretty angry because by the time it cooled off enough for her to eat she had already eaten most of my fries and none of her chicken fingers because she was so hungry. My sister had to catch our waitress about ten minutes into our lunch to ask when her pancakes were going to come out. Our waitress never actually checked on us and she dropped our check off at the table without asking if we would like anything else, that&#39;s too bad because my Mom and Sister were each going to order two bowls of soup to go (the soup was the only good thing about our lunch).

Service is always friendly, but it does depend on who get in regards to how quick they are. If you are a picky eater this is a good spot to try. My bf likes things just so and frequently invents his own items when we go out. This weekend when he wanted to add a side of french toast to his meal, this was no problem and they even let him go so far as to make it cream cheese stuffed strawberry french toast. For a busy sunday I was impressed that the waitress took the time to find out exactly what he wanted and deliver it quickly.

Came here on routine mission to cure my Sunday morning hangover by piling on greasy food. From the positive reviews and the decor I thought that I was in for a good time. Boy was I wrong.

Our waitress was very short with us and looked way over worked. Good luck ever getting a refill of coffee or water from here. Which sucks because I was so hung over. The food was the biggest let down. It was pretty boring and tasted a little bit better than Denny&#39;s or IHOP. The portions were small and it was pretty expensive for what you got.

There is a Juke Box with a giant touch screen flat panel with TONS of music at your disposal. It also accepted credit cards which is kinda dangerous when you have so much metal for me to choose from.

Our first experience was OK. It was extremely hot inside but both front and back doors were open. Having come from Texas we were use to heat but it was a little much. There were maybe 6 people in the whole bar and the bartender pretty much ignored us for a good ten minutes while she just talked with other patrons. When she finally came over to us she didn&#39;t greet us, was rude, and acted like we were a nuisance. We stayed for a few beers and left. The people smoking out back were actually friendlier.

We hadn&#39;t been back which is a shame because it&#39;s in a great area and looks so nice from the outside. Tonight we decided to give it another chance. The air conditioning was on...which was great but a smell of mildew and/or mold was overwhelming. But, being an older bar we understood. It is obvious the owner has made no repairs or updates to this place in a good 20 years.

We sat at the bar. Again, I think there was maybe 5 people in the whole place. All of which were at the bar. We sat there for 10 minutes. I had run to the restroom. When I came back,  still no service. My husband said the bartender came by..looked at him and walked in the back.

I am astonished this place is in business. Is it that much of a local bar they don&#39;t like &#34;outsiders&#34; or new residents? As a business owner I am floored an owner would be ok with employees with ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE customer service. This bar is never busy..how can they be so rude to patrons? In my younger years I was a bartender and can not fathom treating people the way the two bartenders we have encountered here have treated us. Don&#39;t they want tips and isn&#39;t that how they survive? It seriously blows my mind we have had two rude horrible bartenders both times we have been here in less than 3 weeks.

After 10 minutes of sitting at the bar with no service tonight with only 5 other people in the bar, all of whom had drinks, we got up and left. As we were walking out the back the bartender was coming out of the kitchen and accidentally ran into us. My husband apologized (even though she ran in to us, but we were raised with manners) and she gave us both a dirty look and kept walking.

Wow...that is all I can say. We won&#39;t give this place a 3rd chance. I seriously am just so shocked a place that is so slow with hardly any business would treat patrons so rudely. We are great tippers too. Too bad the bartender never got a chance to find out. 

Don&#39;t waste your time. I guess the owner doesn&#39;t care or isn&#39;t involved because I would not employ people with such lack of customer service and people skills."

This place has a very unique odor. Its undeniable and its difficult to stomach. Its one of the only &#34;pubs&#34; in Schaumburg - which aren&#39;t allowed by village law but this place is so old that it is grandfathered in. 

The 1 extra star is that they have good parking, cheap prices, and a lot of regular schaumburgites hang out here - due to lack of options. 

They also get credit for having some of the most ridiculous folk tales about the buildings (Brothel, Al Capone&#39;s hangout, Hotel, blah blah blah)."

Drink enough and you probably won&#39;t notice it. I&#39;ve never seen anybody order food here and I&#39;m not sure they even offer food even though it looks like there might be a kitchen in the back. Most people are too cheap to put money in the jukebox so I usually get to play whatever I want when I&#39;m there. The place is usually filled with townies and regulars but the place doesn&#39;t feel &#34;clicky&#34; at all. Everyone kinda just does their own thing without bothering anyone else. They have a free game room on the other side which is kinda cool if you can ignore the stank.

So you ask why would I give this place 3 stars instead of 2 or 1? Because it is what it is. A dirty old dive where you go to get shitfaced hopefully for less than a commercialized more pretentious bar. I don&#39;t expect half naked cocktail waitresses or live bands and DJs. When drinking at a place like this I&#39;m happy with someone coming by every once to check to see if there might be anything else we need. I don&#39;t even bother considering food at a place like this. Sometimes it feels good to just hang out locally and quietly here."

Easy Street is one of the oldest buildings in Schaumburg. (Perhaps this explains the lingering smell that shows up from time to time?) It was once an inn, but I&#39;ve heard rumor that it was also a brothel at some point, which could explain the name. ;)

Okay. So it&#39;s a weird combo of dive bar and local watering hole. So some of the clientele are a bit sketch. The main point is, drinks are decently priced and the major highlight is that they offer FREE billiards, FREE darts, and FREE foosball. 

The bartenders are generally friendly and the only downside is that the jukebox only plays when you pay--I wish there&#39;d always be music on.

But that is exactly what I like sometimes, well not the smell, but a place where everybody can just be them self, and you sit on the bar and enjoy a couple of cold ones. 

I have to give this place 3 stars 

1 - for originality 
2 - The bartender spoke German 
3 - for the classic rock music and the bartender singing karaoke to it

Our table service was slow but friendly, although if you&#39;re busy playing the free darts or pool you might not care about or want a waitress bugging you anyway.  If you do run empty, though, the bartender was attentive and quick.

A good getaway from all the corporate chain bars of Schaumburg, but I can&#39;t get past the hostility I feel when I go there. A friend put a few songs on jukebox; they were not country (but also not bad club music) and were not appreciated in the slightest (read: multiple angry slurs being thrown out)... but I guess, know your audience. 

Big plus to the free pool (if you&#39;re man enough to step up to it), free darts, and free foosball, but overall it just doesn&#39;t give me that warm feeling townie bars should have.

I started coming here before the smoking ban. I remember my first time vividly because behind the poorly ventilated bar stood the bartender, who was extremely pregnant.  

The bar itself is a cliche. You know that God awful Toby Keith song &#34;I Love This Bar?&#34; This is exactly what he&#39;s talking about. The interior decoration looks like it was provided entirely by a garage sale from 1989. Nothing matches and there&#39;s license plates everywhere. Pool is free, but the table looks like it was built during the Hoover administration. All of the windows have been covered and the lighting is pretty limited as it is. There are no clocks, but the people that usually go there don&#39;t have anywhere else to be anyways.

Speaking of which, the patrons are usually blue collar, hard drinkin&#39;, hard fightin&#39;, hard fartin&#39; sons of bitches. The men are men, and the women are even manlier. They work hard, therefore, they play even harder. Sometimes it&#39;s nice to watch middle-aged white men try to dance. They&#39;re usually friendly and you&#39;ll hear at least one crazy anecdote everytime you go. More often than not, you&#39;ll witness one as it takes place.

The food is typical bar food. It&#39;s moderately priced and average in every sense of the word. The cooking equipment looks like it hasn&#39;t been cleaned ever. I know what it looks like because you have to walk through the kitchen to go outside to the smoking area. People don&#39;t come here to eat.

The music is good. No matter what time you go there, there&#39;s always a group of 3 or 4 hanging out by the jukebox. Don&#39;t expect to hear anything newer than Metallica&#39;s &#34;... And Justice For All.&#34;. And if you play something like 50 Cent&#39;s &#34;Candy Shop&#34;, don&#39;t be surprised if you hear one of the regulars bark out, &#34;Who put this shit on!?&#34; 

There&#39;s never any drink specials. The beer is cold, the whiskey is cheap, and they taste accordingly. You may get a funny look if you order a Sex on the Beach, not because they&#39;re judging you, but because the bartender doesn&#39;t know how to make it.

What&#39;s best about this place is that it&#39;s located smack dab in the middle of Schaumburg like a big middle finger to the yuppie, downtown area.

What&#39;s even better is that it&#39;s right down the street from my house. I&#39;ve been coming here since 2005 and I wouldn&#39;t change a thing. I love this bar."

This location is located in the heart of downtown Arlington Heights. 
It&#39;s always a great choice when you&#39;re done doing some shopping. 
I always love going to Noodles, as you know you WILL get quality. 

I stopped in with a friend for an early lunch after doing some shopping. 
This location is much smaller than other locations (Buffalo Grove, Rolling Meadows). 
However, the place was not uncomfortably packed. 

I decided to order my usual; Pad Thai with Parmesan Chicken. (no sprouts, no peanuts). 
It&#39;s been my go-to dish, other than the Pesto Cavatappi. 

We decided to grab a seat out on the patio. 
The patio was clean and welcoming. 
Our server came out with our food minutes later. 
As usual, it was piping hot and simply perfect. 

The parmesan chicken was crisp, yet juicy. 
Noodles were perfect, vegetables fresh and full of flavor. 
I always love stirring Sriracha and Soy sauce into my pad thai. (I like it HOT) 

As usual, it was an excellent meal and I&#39;ll be returning soon in the near future. 

However, I did have two issues with my visit. 

1. Staff is Swamped - This location needs more staff. The high-school aged girls working the register are simply overwhelmed.

Two things:
First, I was not expecting a bone in my chicken so I could have swallowed it.
And second, should their have been a bone in the chicken breast, or do they use some other part of chicken?
I showed the bone to one of the employees who came to ask if everything was ok and he was nice enough to ask me if I wanted another one after I showed him the bone to which I said no because I had almost finished the one I had already and I was not looking to get anything for free.

The other menu items I&#39;ve sampled have been considerably better. Their cheesy garlic bread with warm marinara sauce is quite good but that is after all only an appetizer.

While it&#39;s not as thin of pizza as I&#39;d like for lunch, it&#39;s still a good solution for lunchtime pizza.  there&#39;s always slices ready to go.

Picked up a sausage, spinach, mushroom, and onion deep dish to go - which is one of the usual go-to pizzas with my family. 

Firstly, the pizza was wetter than usual. The first ominous sign. Secondly, the tomato sauce didn&#39;t look right - and the taste wasn&#39;t the usual splendor that I was used to - it was quite salty. It was almost as if they changed their tomato of choice. The sausage wasn&#39;t the nicely blended sausage I was used to...something was very off. As a whole, the taste wasn&#39;t on par...it was not nicely balanced. It was just - and it pains me to say it - it was just ok. This was the first time where I regretted not hitting Lou&#39;s down the street. 

I will certainly give it another try for them to redeem themselves, but I was quite surprised in my disappointment. Like I opened my review with - I really hope that this was an anomaly!"

I contacted Filberts Soda company looking for their soda and they told me this is the only place that has it around here so I basically went there to buy soda. Fortunately, soda isn&#39;t all that I left with..

I went in, saw the bottles of soda, grabbed 5 flavors and was ready to go when the guy came out of the back with a giant pepperoni pizza fresh from the oven. 

Some guy ahead of me bought 3 slices. I saw the giant slices oozing cheese as he put them in a container. It looked great so spur of the moment...I got a slice. 

Slice of Pepperoni Pizza: this pizza is about the dough. It is thick and light. I swear its the same thickness as their deep dish maybe thicker and its mostly dough. Really light and fluffy with a good amount of cheese and sauce covering it. It&#39;s like eating a giant soft bread stick with cheese and sauce. 

For all you pizza nazi&#39;s/snobs out there. This pizza is for you if you like the crust thick, soft, and bready. If you&#39;re into thin crust, this ain&#39;t your wheel house. 

As per my earlier anecdote, this joint also has Filbert&#39;s Soda. You either like it or you don&#39;t and I love it so go support your Chicago soda maker and try a bottle. 

Basically this is your stereotypical neighborhood pizza joint. Fresh slices, soda, fast service, everything that makes it great. If you&#39;re around, stop by for a slice, you shan&#39;t regret it."

I have had a few bad customer service experiences there but this one tops the cake and I will not be going back.  First, the coupon I had (with no expiration date) was not the right price.  They told me that special was $3.00 more now.  That&#39;s fine.  I still ordered.  I asked the order taker if they had my new address and told them what it was.  They said yes.  When I tried to pay, they asked me for my card number and then told me it was declined.  They failed to ask me for an expiration date!  I told them usually it takes the expiration to go through.  They asked me for my numbers again.  I provided them.  They told me the pizza would be at my house within an hour.  5 minutes after I hung up, they called me back.  They said they accidentally put the charge through as a refund and needed to charge me twice to back out the refund and then actually charge me.  They asked for my credit card number again.  I provided it.  After an hour went by, the delivery didn&#39;t come.  Mario&#39;s called me and asked me if I was at XXX address.  I said NO!  That is my old address.  I told the manager that I asked the order taker if they had my new address and they said yes.  I have lived at my new address for 8 months and have had Mario&#39;s delivery to me within that time.  Why they still had my old address is beyond me.  The manager told me that she would have the driver go to my new address.  She also said it was B*** S***.  Yes, she swore to me on the phone.  I spelled my street name 7 times and they still could not repeat it back to me correctly.  My street name is a very basic work that is  6 letters!!  At this point, I cancelled my order.  I was so livid I couldn&#39;t bring myself to work with these people any longer.  I said I wanted a refund (the second one of the night) and the person on the phone said &#39;okay, we&#39;ll refund you.  Is that it?  Bye.&#34; and hung up.  No apology, no nothing.

It&#39;s exactly what you expect, very loud and fast-paced. I did have to ask for the Olympics to be put on one of the screens which I found very surprising.

This restaurant would be maybe two stars with the service bumped it up to three."

Came in to watch the Cubs postseason away game last night. We walked over to the bar area and sat ourselves. Our waitress was also the bartender. I get that. However, she was not very attentive. She brought us water refills but never asked if we wanted another beer/cocktail. She would run by us and throw silverware on our table (she gave us so much silverware it was like she kept forgetting) and then run by us again and pick up a dirty dish. So fast, we could never catch her to order another round of drinks. My boyfriend finally grabbed her attention when his beer was empty and she was gone before I could also ask for another. Weird. Also, whenever she had a second she would go over to a table with a guy that you can tell worked there but wasn&#39;t working that night, because all the other servers would go over to the same table and hang out too. The bartender and everyone had their phones out, which is just not OK to have out while you&#39;re working. Sara came by at the start of our meal and gave us some sheet of paper that said she was the girl to ask for if we wanted the TVs changed or to know about the membership or whatever. It seemed like that was her only job. All she did was hang out at the table that all the other servers would hang out at. If you&#39;re paying someone to only do that, at least turn the audio off from the Cubs game commercials and turn the audio on from the Hawks game. Come on. Easy job, easy tasks. She also should have been bussing tables or seeing if anyone wanted refills at tables when other servers are busy. When we left we passed by two older gentlemen that said &#34;thanks for coming&#34; who seemed like they were the floor managers. They were by the kitchen door but I didn&#39;t see them the whole night. The food industry is a team job and it didn&#39;t seem that way. I assume Cubs away games are not as busy as home games but it seemed like every worker just stood against the wall, not working. 

The food was good. Cocktails were good. The cocktail with Bacardi and Angry Orchard was as sweet as you&#39;d expect it to be. The Cherry Mojito was sweeter than normal and the mint in my drink was browning. I think if everyone paid more attention to detail it would be more successful place."

The manager was at the bar register and heard it but did nothing or say nothing.. SMDH.  there was and old man sitting by me at the bar and he got up and left and told me he had to go because the drunks was causing a scene.. Please mind you, this was at 3 pm in the afternoon.. Lol.

Two parties of 4 get tables ahead of us. There&#39;s a long table that wasn&#39;t cleaned until we finished eating since before we got there. So they stuck us all on 2 small tables put together. 

Took 15 minutes to get our drinks. I didn&#39;t get a refill till I was done eating followed by telling us &#34;sorry I was busy with other tables&#34; when she was just talking with another table. 

Wings had no sauce on it. She touched the food as she tried to hand em to us.

Went here this past weekend with my mom. The only thing that disappointed me was they get rid of their lunch specials on the weekend...probably because they get most business on the weekends and are trying to get as much money from their customers as they can :/ so that was disappointing but our meal was very good. I got a small boneless wings, half teriyaki and half medium sauce. I asked our waitress to make them &#34;wet&#34; which means more sauce than usual, but she put &#34;extra wet&#34; stickers on my order so my wings came literally drenched in sauce, way too much to be appetizing. So that lack of communication was a little frustrating but I just put my wings in another paper bowl away from all the sauce. 

Our waitress was extremely nice and friendly. This is a great location, just a few short blocks from Woodfield Mall."

They helped me decide on what type of wings to order. I went with deep fried pickles as an appy and the boneless wings with Asian zing sauce and lemon pepper spices. I really liked there deep fried pickles and the Asian zing definitely had a nice kick! I liked the lemon pepper wings but I don&#39;t think I would order again it was just nice to try the one time. Maybe explore another flavor next time instead. Definitely a good place to have a beer and watch sports! They have a bunch of TVs!

We waited another 5mn until she came back to get our order. She explained she was new and her first day. (Why would her first day be during the lunch rush? ) she was clearly overwhelmed by our difficult order of wings, nachos and a wrap. We then started the table timer after sitting there already for 30 mn. The food arrived after the timer went off, and the order was wrong. She said that a manager would come by. No manager showed up for 10mn and then proceeded to &#34;justify&#34; everything!! I had to ask the hostess for a to go box! Horrible service, bad food!! I will never go back."

I am proud to be the Yelp &#34;Duke&#34; here as I have checked in here the most times then anyone ever coming to this location. 
I am an NCAA coach and so obviously I live my sports, beer, and wings. Alpha male style. I recently had to move temporarily to Cleveland to coach at an NCAA college out there so whenever I come back home I have to come to this location. I have been to other locations in this area, but this is my number one spot.
I personally think the service here is awesome. I never had problems here and I usually have Greg as my server. He is now a trainer and has been my favorite server so far out of ALL the locations. He is also a trainer and I hope he goes up the ranks within the company. He always knows what my order will be as well as my girlfriend without us even saying anything. Good memory!!!!
The only complaint I have is how prices are increasing especially for the wings. This is not the locations fault and not even corporate. I heard that demand was so much for these wings that the 3rd party that supplies the wings couldn&#39;t keep up. They need to lower it because I personally think it&#39;s too much. I also think they should do an all day thing for Veterans Day and not just 3 hours, but I know corporate is trying and they actually do a lot for the military. The Tuesday and Thursday night wing specials are probably why they are special because of the price and this is probably why these wings are expensive on other days.
Great food, great service, and I can see why they do good revenue wise. I usually sit at the bar side with a table. If you do, please make sure Greg is your waiter. He had been here for several years and always guaranteed a great service!"

What a waste of money - Chicken wrap was suppose to have asian zing tenders and maybe only one tender had it on there and i think there were a total of 2 tenders in the whole wrap and it was just cut in pieces. Very few fries but they were cold and not just like they had been sitting for a little bit they were cold probably had been sitting out a couple hours. Don&#39;t waste your money on the mac and cheese. BIGGEST waste of money - no flavor and how do you charge 9.29 for one thin layer of noodles. UGH just terrible - management you should be ashamed of yourselves for letting food go out to customers like this. I wouldn&#39;t come back if it were free!

On all of the occasions that i have been to this location the service has been terrible. I came in with a couple of friends for lunch and the place was quite empty . There was about 4 other tables there. We were sat and it took our waitress about 10 minutes just to get our drinks. We then ordered appetizers as we waited for others to arrive and it took more than 20 minutes for those to come out. Mind you during this whole time the waitress had a shit attitude and did not check up on us whatsoever. As soon as the rest of our party arrived we placed our food order and our appetizers had still not come out. We then waited 30 minutes for our food to come out and when it was brought out the waitress mentioned my order had been given to the wrong table and would be remade. she was not apologetic whatsoever. I work in the food industry and it is unacceptable for a table to wait more than 30 minutes for a lunch meal nor is it acceptable to have one person  wait longer on their food while everyone else eats. i cant stress enough how bad the service was from this waitress she couldn&#39;t even stop by our table to offer us refills we had to reach out to a different server mind you the place was empty! wish i would have taken down her name. overall this locations service is a joke and the food quality is mediocre.

I ordered boneless wings and got a paper boat full of chunks of fried breading with almost no chicken in them.  The regular wings are slimy and nasty now.  Used to be crisp and juicy.  When they used to sell the wings by count, they were much better.  They must have changed their business model, their wing supplier, or both because since the change the quality of the food has gone down hill drastically.  I have given BWW several chances and have been waiting for them to figure this out because I really used to like them.  However, at this point I am done.  This place sux."

A couple of work buddies and I went to this BWW for lunch.  When the waitress came out, she told us that they were doing a test run on a promotion that they have to get food out in 15 minutes or less. The idea of the promotion (as clearly stated on the timer which she left with us) is that if the food doesn&#39;t arrive within the 15 minute time frame then &#39;your food is free&#39;.  She left a tablet with a timer on our table and she started it up.  The 15 minutes ran up and a little later our food showed up.  We notified the server and he said that it was a test run and we don&#39;t get the food for free.  Then the general manager came by and I told him.  He responded that it does not say anywhere that the food would be free.  I then showed him the tablet on our table which said 15 minutes or the food is free.  After seeing that, he responded that in his experience no lunch has ever come out in over 15 minutes, so he would have to check with the server.  When he came back a free minutes later, he said &#34;well its just a test run so you&#39;ll have to pay for it.  It is what it is&#34;.  Not wanting to make a scene we decided just to pay and be on our way. If the wanted to simply get an idea of how long it took their food to come out, then they could have simply asked if we minded if they had a timer on our table. Instead, both the waiter AND THE TIMER ITSELF said that we would get free food if it took longer than 15 minutes. Worse than running a &#39;fake&#39; promotion or a &#39;test&#39; promotion was the managers approach to a resolution: &#39;it is what it is&#39;. BWW is a great restaurant and has delicious food but I urge people to stay clear of this specific location. This doesn&#39;t have anything to do with our server and I hope that other people who run into a similar problem still remember to tip since this reflects a problem with policy and management and not so much a service error.

I had frequented this place about a year ago since it is close to where I work. Now I remember why I stopped going."

TVs everywhere and lots of screaming raving fans.  We went in the middle of the afternoon today and avoided the crowds at night.  And, yes, it can get very crowded with a very long wait there.

After not eating all day, we were hungry by 3:30 PM.  We ordered 18 wings, 6 each of Asian Zest, Carribean Jerk and Hot.  We also had celery and carrots, french fries (not the ones with salt and vinegar) and cole slaw.  The food was good.  After not eating all day, we gorged ourselves.

They have those electronic game pads there where you compete on trivia questions while the questions and results are posted on TV sets overhead.  We tried it and quickly realized we were competing with the people at the table next to us.  That was an added benefit and some unexpected fun.

My only complaint was the service was not up to snuff.  Oh, the hostess and the servers were friendly and helpful.  But, once we placed the order, our waitress disappeared.  People who entered the restaurant after we did were served long before we were.  When I finally did see her and tried to wave her down, she nodded in acknowledgement and came out with our food. So, my question is, how long did it stay under the heat lamps?

My BFFL and I came here after spending the day shopping and the service was AMAZING!!

I have never had such a wonderful server- so much so we even commented about her to the manager. 

The things she was great at:

1) She was friendly but not chatty (I don&#39;t like servers who want to know my life story)
2) She brought us drinks and food on time
3) She asked if we needed anything but she never &#34;hovered&#34;
4) She made sure our drinks were ALWAYS FULL and even brought out additional drinks when ours were almost done
5) She was timely and did everything with a smile.

We definitely made sure she was over-tipped because service like that is RARE!!

Simply put,

The good..
I like the flavors of the sauces, you can tell they put a lot of time into perfecting them.

The bad.. 
THE COST
15 ala cart wing order is 15.99.  Really 1.00+ per wing?

Ordered two of these (15 piece orders and a large frie) for a few people stopping over.

5 of us ate them in all about 10 minutes.  They were good, but they are ridiculously overpriced..

Almost 38 bucks for 30 wings and fries and we all wanted more..  

A great deal with the gift card, without it, no way.  

Wingstop is just as good if not better, and 20-30% cheaper.

These are just wings, why are they so expensive?

Obviously we are paying for the overhead and staff of the big restaurants and corporate greed."

I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve just outgrown this wing mecca or if this particular location just stinks.

My coworkers and I went here for lunch one day in order to satisfy a craving for junk food, and junk is exactly what we got.  It was fairly busy for a weekday but not too bad for a lunch rush, if you ask me.  There were 8 of us, and the service was t-e-r-r-i-b-l-y slow.  Mind you, this location is smack dab in the middle of an area of Schaumburg that is chalk full of offices, so it sort of baffled me that they waited on our table like we were a bunch of Sunday drivers with nothing better to do.

Most of us got boneless wings, covered in a variety of sauces.  The parmesan garlic and the mango habanero sauces were extremely salty (salt lick&#39;s got nothin on these, yuck) to the point that I couldn&#39;t finish any of my lunch.  Their fries are alright, but nothing to write home about &amp; certainly nothing to come back for.

We wolfed down our food (begrudgingly) and then sat around and waited for our check (and waited and waited).  An hour and a half for glorified fast food kid&#39;s lunch...no thank you.  With a plethora of options around our work, you can bet your sweet booty that I won&#39;t be making it a point to come back here again."

Surprisingly, the place was pretty empty and we were seated right away. As soon as we were seated, a lady walked around handing out free samples of the Spinach Artichoke Chicken Flatbeard. It was amazing, so we decided to order it. This was probably the best thing we had here!

We all ordered a bunch of wings with different sauces to share. Our food took forever to come out and this place was empty for the most part. When we finally got the wings about 20 minutes later, they were all cold. Our server was inattentive for the most part and he got our order wrong on multiple things, so idk if this had to do with all our wings being cold. My favorite wing sauce from here was the Mango Habanero. I normally love the Parmesan Garlic, but it was pretty bad here..."

I have been waiting for this day to arrive ever since I got word that about the new location. The addition just made the village of Schaumburg better for good eats. 

The Schaumburg location is set up differently in comparison to the other BW3s that I have been to. Because of the surrounding area of corporate offices, there are plenty of seating for 2-4 people. This is perfect for a quick lunch if you are in the area. They even have a promotional punch card for frequent diners during lunch time. The location is very spacious so seating for a group of coworkers for lunch or afterwards to watch the game won&#39;t be a problem. Although there is a lot of competition in the area of excellent places to eat, I anticipate plenty of traffic on Tuesdays and Thursdays for their weekly wing specials. 

There were two errors with the order that were quickly corrected. One downside was that the wings were a little cold when they arrived. These are minor issues to me since the location is new and they are still working on getting their mojo together. It won&#39;t stop me from eating 24 wings by myself and enjoying their Caribbean Jerk, Hot BBQ, Parmesan Garlic, and the new Jammin&#39; Jalapeno sauces. 

Besides the minor hiccups, this BW3 will find it&#39;s groove shortly."

We usually come here on Friday&#39;s during work for lunch.  Recently they have been asking if we want to sit in the &#34;stadium&#34; seating section.  I don&#39;t know why but this is just an area with high bar stools at tables.  For the most part service here is just about average.  The one thing that they do know how to do is to get you to use your stamp card.  For every time you come during lunch you can get a stamp that will eventually add up to something free.  I never do it because I don&#39;t come that often.  

I always get the Jerk Chicken Sandwich.  This is really good and always taste the same.  The only thing that is hit or miss is the size of the chicken you get.  This and a side of fries never fills me up but its a little too expensive to add anything more to my lunch menu."

My coworkers and I had been waiting for BWW to open since we saw it was coming in a couple of months ago. And at long last, they opened yesterday! Woohoo!

I went with my friend for dinner tonight. We were surprised the parking lot was so full, eek!

Pro-Tip; Tuesday Wings Day = Wings are 45 cents each! A good deal if you ask me!

There were wayyyyy too many workers but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s because they just opened. I&#39;m hoping there won&#39;t be so many extra people just hanging around once things get moving at this location.  Our server was super nice, beyond attentive, very friendly. All of the workers seemed really happy to be there and friendly.

Apparently they can play some kind of trivia game for you on your TV, I have to try that next time. This location has tons of TVs everywhere, I&#39;m sure a great place to watch games.

I haven&#39;t really tried any of the appetizers here so we went with the garlic deep fried mushrooms. They came with some ranch and were super tasty! Nomnomnomz. 

We also got 24 wings to share---12 of which I couldn&#39;t eat because my poor weak taste buds can&#39;t handle the spice. We tried the Salt &amp; Vinegar which neither of us had had at BWW before and I was pleasantly surprised! The seasoning truly tasted like salt &amp; vinegar chips. We also got 6 of the Parmesan Garlic which for me pushed my mouth to the limit! But the flavoring on the wings was oh-so-good! Loved them.

Great service, great food, great atmosphere. I&#39;ll definitely be back! The question now is----Do they deliver!? We are always trying new places for wings for our weekly Beer O Clock at work!"

I get that the color scheme of the BWW uniform is composed of a black or yellow jersey but what&#39;s up with this place being out of control with the number of employees, supervisors and managers swarming around the restaurant like bumble bees?

Seriously, I went to the take-out counter to order food to go. No one in line ahead of me; the perimeter was surrounded by employees and one supervisor so busy talking among themselves that I had to get the cashier&#39;s attention for service.

She gave me a buzzer and we sat in the bar area until our food was ready. A server asked if we were waiting for carry out, as if in passing; she didn&#39;t bother to ask us if we wanted something to drink while we waited. Jason had to stop her from walking off. He ordered a Diet. She did come back to bring him a refill while his glass was still half full.

I understand, this must be the first job for most of them. It&#39;s clear the employees come without any experience and the staff is still in training. For my part, overlooking today&#39;s mishaps are taken into consideration. I think it&#39;s great that BWW gave these kids an opportunity and I hope they all succeed.

The layout is very cool. You walk in and you&#39;re immediately greeted by 3 people at the hostess stand. The take-out counter is in an alcove just behind them to the right. To the left is the open dining room. Walk straight back and it opens up to the bar area with hi tops, tables, bar and a lot of TVs."

Okay, there are TVs everywhere, and you watch them while you enjoy typical sports bar food, specifically wings. We&#39;ve all seen this setup before. So how does BWW (or at least, this particular location) stack up?

The service wasn&#39;t that bad. For a peak time, we were lucky (keyword: luck. If our party were any larger it could have easily been a while) enough to be seated right away, and were promptly helped by our server. He had to check if featured appetizers were still in stock. Tsk tsk. He was really busting his ass, to the point that he was a little absent-minded.

I had the chicken sandwich. the patty was practically razor thin, and the wild sauce (way hotter than the traditional buffalo) barely had a kick. And they were wimpy with that. Also, you get maybe a handful of fries at most. Ordering fries on the side is pretty expensive for the tiny amount they give you, if you wanna compare it to a similar place like Applebee&#39;s. 

Also, the wings suck. It&#39;s close to $7 for six of them. They barely put ANY sauce on the darn things. And they come in a little paper basket, like it&#39;s getting served from a food truck.

So yeah...it&#39;s a poor value, you get tiny, flavorless portions, and have to compete with bustling crowds of fools who actually think this is good. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it looks cool...but as a bar OR a chain restaurant, I don&#39;t think this is a good idea."

Tuesdays- 45 cent wings.
Thursdays- 50 cents boneless wings

Always have beer specials. A good place to hang out for dinner. But not my favorite. I would def. not pick this place as a place to catch up with friends, if I wanted that, I&#39;d go to John Barleycorn in the area. But for a dinner and game, this is a good choice."

It seems like Buffalo Wild Wings (Sorry, not calling this place B-Dubs) is in the process of cutting back to save a buck. That is, the portion sizes have gone down. Whereas you used to be able to get a set amount of wings, now they come based on &#34;weight.&#34; So instead of ordering 12 wings, you&#39;ll get the &#34;equivalent of 10,&#34; which naturally comes out to less than the 12. Oh, and you&#39;re paying more now despite no changes in the quality of the meat. (You can still order a select amount of wings on Tuesdays and Thursdays for their specials, though.)

The cutting back isn&#39;t just restricted to the wings. I&#39;ve noticed that my side orders have shown up with less food, and I get less sauce now in my orders. And once again the prices still go up. I understand that companies have to occasionally raise prices to keep a profit, but this seems like all taking and no giving back.

Thankfully, the service here is usually excellent, which keeps me coming back. However the reduced portion sizes for what I pay may make me think about different choices for wings in the future."

Potato wedges w/ Cheese .  We ordered queso on the side to dip in.  These are nice.  I like them with the ranch as well :)

Boneless wings are expensive when you don&#39;t go on Thursday or maybe it&#39;s Tuesday, one of the days is boneless days the other is bone-in (original).  It&#39;s much cheaper on those days.  But the wings don&#39;t come with ranch or celery on those days.  they charge 50 cents each.

We tried some of their new dry rubs, like chipotle bbq and desert heat.  Both are very good.  Decently spicy and flavorful.

The traditional honey bbq and mango habenero are also very good.  The mango has some kick to it, so be prepared. 

My friend&#39;s birthday was that week so we got free snicker&#39;s pie.  It tastes like a snickers but less nutty.  Pretty good though, normal price is 3.50!  I would not buy that for that small piece of pie.

One of my brothers ordered ribs and shrimp, almost 14 dollars.  He said they were very good ribs, I did like the shrimp but the tartar sauce is nasty, cheap and tastes worse than old tartar in a bottle from a grocery store.

The service was excellent, very attentive, and very engaging/entertaining.  They kept our drinks full and was very good at meeting our every need.

We were there for like 4 hours watching an OKC/Miami finals game, and they never hurried us outt a there which was nice.  There was a group of 6 of us.

The only bummer was that the wifi was not working, had not been working since Friday the manager said, and happens often.  That kinda sucks. So we played with the playmaker on poker instead."

It wasn&#39;t very busy and we order wings and I got a burger. We got a lot of traditional wings and in the mix there were several boneless wings in the mix. Since there was a mix some of the wings we couldn&#39;t eat because they were in cooked. My burger was a frozen mess. I asked nicely to have them take it back and asked them to cook it please. I got it back and the burger was chopped up like ground beef. Im very dissipated due to the fact that I am a regular costumer. Dont think I will be coming back.

They had last call for the bar right before we arrived so we were sat and debating whether to try elsewhere.  Our server might as well have been calling up nearby restaurants for us to check when their last call was.  He apparently did not want us to be there and trust me, it showed.  

Out meal was room temperature at best, yea sure we&#39;re probably the last table/order but I expect decent at minimum. Who doesn&#39;t LOVE horrible service and food that seemed like the leftovers from other tables.  With spicy wings comes a great responsibility... of refilling my beverage the second before i drink the last drop.  Irresponsible people here indeed.  Almost had to get up and fill my drink myself with my sandpaper tongue.

Why do we keep coming here?  I have no idea!  It&#39;s ridiculous.  But honestly, this past time was definitely my last.  Two bad dates and you&#39;re done.  I&#39;m a strict believer on second chances especially for restaurants.  The GM for this franchise location needs to do something to turn it around.  The location is pretty decent and the potential is there no doubt.  There&#39;s no reason this place shouldn&#39;t have a better rating, you just have to do some serious retraining on customer retention. and food quality control.  Good luck BDubs."

The few times I&#39;ve been here for lunch, it&#39;s been fantastic. They are very liberal with their sauce which is fantastic for BWW (unlike other ones I&#39;ve been to). Their service is excellent as they fill your drink very fast. The manager also roams here a lot. I&#39;m not a huge fan of spicy and so my highest spice I try is spicy garlic.

My favorites? Spicy garlic, mild, medium, and honey BBQ. Give it a try! :)"

So, my company orders lunch from Buffalo Wings several times throughout the month; and we usually go for take-out since we usually like toeat lunch while having our noon meeting. One of our staff/coworkers would make the order and go to pick up orders for us.  

During this particular time, I had ordered the BWW Chicken tenders with the Mango Habanero sauce, and the sauce was forgotten. &#34;OH NO!&#34; We thought; that&#39;s the best part of the meal!! The sauce!! So, devastated I was.. So in the past when things were forgotten, we let it go and move on.. but this was a straw. We got on the phone with a manager and let him know that this was something like the 5th time something in our order were amiss. Yes, we are a large crowd, so understandably getting together a large lunch order can get crazy, a simple sauce can be missed here or there, some wings run off. I get that.. But this particular day, I really didn&#39;t want to go without sauce for the Chicken tenders!! 

So, alas when a phone call was made and without hesitation; this manager drove to our office, and with his genuine apologies, he gave us the missing sauce for my chicken tenders. SWEET!! 

I must say, that had me pretty impressed, and really appreciate the customer service experience that this manager brought today.  It turned out to be a very nice lunch after all; so I really want to extend a very warm thank you to this Manager."

The Coors light was good and was very well priced (which isnt hard to accomplish), but the boneless wings were dry and had more breading on them than actual chicken.

Sorry BWW Schaumburg, today was my last visit to you. The wings were good, but that wasn&#39;t my issue. For some reason you&#39;re very different from other BWWs in the area.

Today I brought a giftcard to pay with. When I got my receipt back, on the tip line was written, &#34;NOGCTIPS&#34;. Not sure what this was about I asked the manager. He told me BWW does not accept tips on giftcards. I asked if it was just this location and he said no, the computer system itself doesn&#39;t accept tips on giftcards. What&#39;s interesting about this is that before the Schaumburg location opened I had been going to the Hoffman Estates location for years. Countless times I&#39;ve paid with giftcards and left tips with no issues. So the story is fishy if you ask me. I&#39;ve also emailed BWW on their website to clarify this and will update my review here depending on the response I get, but I can tell you I&#39;ve tipped many times before on giftcards at BWW, this is the first time I&#39;ve ever had any issues. 

The worst part was I had no cash on me, so I had to borrow some money from a friend so I could tip my waitress. Oh well, what can you do."

I order wings and buffalo chips with cheese for pick up. Once I got my food and returned to work, I noticed there was a white, paint like substance on the bottom of my food. I called in to complain of the issue and the manager apologized and offered coupons to compensate for my troubles. I  waited over a month for the coupons to come in the mail. I called on around August 11th to ask about the coupons and was greeted with a very apologetic manager (names slips my mind, but I will be sure to add it later). This guy was amazing. He seems very sincere and empathetic about the issue I had and gave me a free order that night and still provided the coupons to me. This service I received that night completely made me forget about the bad experience I had. I would highly recommend this place. They care about their customers and their reputation.

The wings seem to be much better here then at other BBW locations. They put a lot of sauce on each wing and they make sure the wings are actually done! I cant tell you how many times I have bitten into a traditional wing from BB that wasn&#39;t fully cooked.  I dint even risk it any more. I only order boneless now."

We placed our order, a medium wings with TWO (count them TWO) sauce options.  When he repeated the order is was very fast, but it sounded right.  It took about another 20 minutes for the wings to arrive.  They must have had to kill the chickens.  Did I mention it was not crowded?  When the order arrived, there was only one sauce.  Oops.  Unfortunately, due to the slow service, we did not have the time to have them re-make the wings.  But, we did let the person know we were upset the order came out wrong.  The wings we ended up with were a lot spicier than when we had them in the past, so this time, I was unable to eat them.  They never asked why we did not finish our wings, they must not have cared.

Being a fast-casual place that shared space with a hot dog joint, I wasn&#39;t expecting gourmet pasta dishes.  It took a while for my order to come up, but the employees were very friendly and accommodating, so I didn&#39;t mind.  I took one bite of my baked spaghetti, and I have to say, I was blown away.  I was pleasantly surprised by the baked noodles and cheeses with meat sauce on top; flavorful, hot, and filling.

Pesto Chicken Pasta
Feccucine Alfredo with Chicken
Chicken Parmesan with marinara sauce.

I work in sales so I&#39;l typically order breakfasts for my clients for morning drop offs. I typically order from the Woodfield location because it&#39;s close to my office. I live 2 blocks from this location and since I would be hitting the road early, I ordered from the location closest to me. 

I ordered a catering order for 70+ people and this was back in January.

When I arrived to this location, the bagels were not cut, they were not in boxes but in paper bags. I told the lady that this order was not correct because I ordered the large catering boxes through catering over the phone who assured me all would be set.!She told me all of the catering goes to the Elk Grove location (15+ miles from where I was) and proceeded to tell me that I needed to go there to &#34;get the bagels cut&#34; and put into catering boxes. There was 8 inches of snow on the ground and I was carrying 6+ bags of bagels

The right thing for her to do would have been to order these catering orders closest to where I was going in libertyville, but instead suggested that I get in my own car and across town to fix a mistake that they had made. One would have to assume that she wanted the sales for my large order without having to do ANY of the work. Minimally, she should have had someone else jump into their car and take the large order there and had me meet for pick up. I had 6 large bags of bagels that I had to carry in and out by myself! Did I say 8 inches of snow? No discount? Terribly disappointed and have not and will not be ordering Panera for any other of my breakfast orders which are typically once per week. 

The Elk Grove location was very kind upon arrival and did give me a coffee for the &#34;trouble&#34; that the other location had &#34;caused&#34; but after an hour and a half of driving there &amp; waiting for the order, and getting on the road, and being late to my appointment with no apologies.. needless to say I will not be back"

However, we were there last night because my daughter is obsessed with their macaroni and cheese--for good reason.  It&#39;s yummy!!

However, this review is for my meal yesterday, I  got the You Pick 2 with the Chicken Noodle Soup and the Grownup grilled cheese (three different kind of cheeses and bacon).  I also tried their Penne Bolognese pasta because it seemed like it would be a good idea...

Penne Bolognese:  Bad.  I took two bites of my $9 (super small!!!!!) pasta and that.was.it.  It was really, really not good.  And I am not that picky about pasta and sauces.  It had a horrible aftertaste.  I was not impressed at all.

The chicken noodle soup was ok (they&#39;ve changed their recipe to make it &#34;all natural&#34; and it&#39;s not as good as it used to be.  but the grilled cheese was the biggest disappointment.  It&#39;s &#34;grilled&#34;, but one side of the sandwich wasn&#39;t cooked AT ALL (see picture) and none of the cheeses were melted.  I literally pulled it apart slice by slice.  I shouldn&#39;t be able to do that--the cheeses should be melded together in a grilled cheese, no?

I hope things improve for next time :(  And definitely skip the penne!"

Most recently, we enjoyed eating our breakfast on their outdoor patio.  (Here&#39;s looking at you, Kathleen M.!)  There were only about three tables outside, but we snagged one and enjoyed the light breeze. There was nowhere to discard our plates and garbage outside, but it&#39;s a really small area, so I&#39;m just grateful for the option to sit there. The juggling while we opened the door back up to throw away the garbage, made the experience a bit more adventurous.

The chips...oh my gosh...delicious. And the salsa was great too! There were 3 options, all of which were great.

I split an order of steak tacos (with cilantro and onion) and an order of chicken enchilada suizas with a friend. Both were delicious. If I had to recommend one over the other- I would say steak tacos, but I would order both again.

The whole time we were there, people were stopping in to pick up take out orders- I will definitely follow their lead! I have been looking for a great takeout place for years and am excited to have found one.

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was there was no alcohol, so it was more of a get in, get out place. Less lounging and hanging out than most restaurants. But no complaints about what was there!  Definitely plan to visit again soon...

The horchata wasn&#39;t my favorite, I&#39;d unfortunately have to disagree with the other yelper, a place closer to me does it much better. I can&#39;t remember why, it may have been too much cinnamon?  Or the flavor was a bit off?

They need to put their hours of operation on here! I think a majority of the nights they&#39;re open until 9.. but I&#39;m not sure about Sunday if it closes earlier.

I decided to dine in.  When you dine in they give you complimentary chips &amp; salsa.  They brought three different types of salsa to the table &amp; all three were delicious.  

I went ahead &amp; ordered the steak burrito dinner which comes with beans &amp; rice.  The beans &amp; rice weren&#39;t a big portion but they were good.  The burrito was delicious.  Most burritos I&#39;ve had lately from other places tasted too salty or were pretty small, but not here.  The burrito tasted fresh &amp; full of flavor.  The size of the burrito was just right.  It wasn&#39;t the biggest burrito I&#39;ve seen but it definitely got you full.  

I have ate here a few times since my first visit.  I walked in one day &amp; got an order for take out, it took a little longer than expected but they were busy so it didn&#39;t bother me at all.  

The restaurant is clean &amp; the staff is always friendly so it makes for a good dining experience.  This restaurant is one of my new favorite burrito places &amp; I look forward to eating here again."

My son wanted a steak burrito and I didn&#39;t find out they gave me 1 steak taco (made Mexican style) until I got home (15-minute drive).  I didn&#39;t get a receipt so I didn&#39;t know the accuracy of the order.  But based on my calculations, I paid for the $7 burrito instead of the $2 tacos.  This place serves tripas tacos which is the reason why we tried the place.  It was good but for the price they charged, the tacos were too small compared to what we had at other places.  My husband was still hungry after eating 3.  I gave up my chimichanga to my son (he wasn&#39;t crazy about it), so I had to share the nachos with one of my daughters because of this.  We ordered 3 American-style (with lettuce and cheese) tacos and 3 Mexican (with onions and cilantro) steak style tacos - they messed that up and made all American style.   The place is what you would expect of a taqueria like this - I wasn&#39;t there for the place.  The cashier / server was not very good in taking orders - I had to remind her that I paid for 4 Cokes in cans and 2 churros.  I should&#39;ve have known to check the rest of the order before I left the place.  I like the food but I will make sure next time I pick up a take-out order if I ever come back."

We went on $1 taco day so place was busy for lunch.   We had to wait 25 minutes for some tacos, which seems like a long time.  They seemed more concerned with taking care of the regulars eating in, than people taking food out.  A person who came in after us said something to the cook in Spanish and he was in and out in about 5 minutes with his food.    Kitchen is tiny so I understand things take time.

Even close to the panzerotti&#39;s in Italy.  You can tell they are home made. In fact, on a few occasions I have seen an italian elderly woman working in the kitchen.  The dough is divine, soft, tender and filled with either bocconcini (barese style)  or mozzarella, they are delicious!  My sister always orders a huge tray of the &#39;mini panzerottis&#39; for her Christmas parties every year and they are always a big hit!!!! (highly recommend).  Staff has always been helpful and friendly..

The pizza is very good as well.  Not wood burning oven pizza, but they make a wonderful thin crust .  I&#39;ve had the Margherita (w/bocconcini &amp; fresh basil), sausage w/mushrooms and they were delicious.  Also tried the combo (beef/sausage) sandwich and to my surprise was tender &amp; juicy.

Asked the waitress/cashier what her favorite slice was, ordered up a slice of sausage, and chatted with her a bit waiting for the slice to come out.  

During the conversation, she said that the pizza is awesome, and that it&#39;s like the owners had brought Italy to the restaurant... the pizza was like a taste of Italy!  I didn&#39;t want to come off douchey and tell her that I just came back from Italy a few months ago, so I figured I&#39;d let the pizza speak for itself...

It&#39;s not a taste of Italy.  If she had said a taste of NYC style pizza, she&#39;d be far closer.  But even though it&#39;s not a taste of Italy, it really is a a great deal... $3 for a pretty nice sized slice.

By a wide margin, Antica offers my favorite local thin crust pizza. Don&#39;t be reluctant to try their non-pizza menu items though. Seriously, just close your eyes, point at the menu, and you&#39;ll be delighted with whatever comes out of the kitchen.

The dining room is on the small side, but don&#39;t be afraid to take your order to-go. Take-out is just as good as dining in. My only issues? The chicken sandwich is good, but can be a bit in the dry side. I&#39;m glad Antica doesn&#39;t drench it in mayo, but it needs a little something. I like to add a little red wine vinaigrette salad dressing or a nice sweet whole grain mustard. Makes a good sandwich perfect. And their Antico salad is quite heavy on red onion. I like to order mine &#34;easy onion.&#34;

I had heard some good things about the panzerottis here, so I tried to give them a try.  Being that I don&#39;t have the longest lunch break, I attempted to call in my panzerotti order, so it would be just about done when I get there.  (should be a simple request right?).  Well it turns out that this place will not accept a preorder over the phone???  I mean you accept people phoning in takeout orders, but you will not let me call in an order to eat in your establishment, where I then am going to spend more money on profitable items like drinks.  I thought about changing my order to pick up, and then dining in, but then I went with my anger and sided with the part of my brain that thinks they do NOT deserve my hard earned money.  Congrats to removing yourself from my list of Pizza establishments in the suburbs.  Bad service will not be rewarded with my business.  Learn to properly run a business and maybe I will return.

To be fair I would give the pizza I tasted 3/5 (based on dine in pre cooked slices, I would assume the fresh cooked would be better, but I will never know now).

Service 1/5 (Probably a 2 on my first dine in experience, a ZERO on the time they wouldnt let me order ahead for dinein)."

Fried Platter - 2 mozzarella sticks, 2 fried ravioli, 5 breaded zucchini, 5 breaded    mushrooms, 5 onion rings, 2 jalape√±o poppers.  This was just not very good and I have had better.  It was over cooked and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fresh.  It almost tasted like it had been in the freezer for a while. The marinara sauce on the side was bland, and the ranch was watery.  I was not impressed with this.

Brushetta - baked bread, tomato, basil, e.v.o.o.  This, too, was not great.  By the time I got it, it was watery at the bottom because of the tomatoes.  Maybe it&#39;s best to eat it at the restaurant.  Who knows, but all I know is that it fell apart when I grabbed it.  I would not order this from them again.

Caesar Salad - crispy lettuce, grilled chicken, tomato, croutons, Caesar dressing - $6.25.  If I remember correctly a Caesar Salad comes with Caesar Dressing.  The salad they delivered was Antico Salad - crispy lettuce, tomato, cucumber, red onion, Italian dressing - $4.25.  I received the wrong order.

The only thing I can think of is that they were having a bad day or it was so busy that living up to their reputation was too hard.  I still give them 5 stars for their pizza because they definitely have the best pizza in this area.  Anyone who wants to order from Pizzeria Antica, just order their pizza until they improve on their other menus.  Not worth ordering at this time."

Why not? Because everything else is so good! A big thing that sets Antica apart from other local pizza places (apart from quality) is the fact that they feature their homemade bocconcini in many dishes. It&#39;s as good as you&#39;d expect. From the prosciutto and bocconcini appetizer (served with house-made ciccia, an unbelievably delicious herbed flatbread) to their panzerotti to their homemade arancini, you notice the difference. 

It&#39;s not far from my house, so it&#39;s a favorite local place. Sometimes, we wish it wasn&#39;t so close, as it would make a wonderful lunch destination for a motorcycle ride. But then we realize that&#39;s completely stupid, because we&#39;re so lucky to have a place like this just a few minutes away. 

The panini are fantastic, too. But my absolute favorite thing on the menu is their eggplant sandwich. It&#39;s very lightly breaded, fried perfectly, and topped with the perfect amount of their homemade marinara. Definitely near the top of the list of last things I want to eat before I die. It is *that* good.

Desserts! I&#39;ve never tried their tiramisu, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s as good as everything else. Thing is, everyone and their brother offers tiramisu now. What you need to try here (that is, if you have room) is their cornetto Nutella. It&#39;s a warm croissant sliced in half and smeared with Nutella. Then it&#39;s toasted, so the outside is slightly crispy, but the inside is pillowy and soft. More importantly, this ensures that the nutella melts. Finally, they top it with powdered sugar, whipped cream, and a drizzle of nice chocolate syrup (not sure of the brand, but it&#39;s not too sweet like Hershey&#39;s; more on the dark, rich side). Better split this one with someone else at your table. Maybe more than one someone. Absolutely worth it. :9"

We used our Groupon here and went late on a weeknight. Service was very friendly, so I was happy about that. I decided to order the calamari, and they came out wonderfully. The breading was seasoned with salt, herbs and wonderfully light and crunchy. It came accompanied with an ample amount of lemons and a bright cup of slightly chunky tomato sauce. So I had high hopes going into the pizza.

We&#39;ve actually been to Naples, and had a real Italian Margherita pizza, from Pizzeria Antica de Michele. So I was interested in seeing how this Pizzeria Antica Margherita pizza would stack up against that one.

It was no contest (Naples wins) but it&#39;s important to see this pizza in that light--this is no deep dish pie. The crust is super, super thin, baked in such high heat that it hardens almost to a crisp in the oven. The Bocconcini cheese they make at the restaurant is an excellent cheese, almost like a sharp gouda-mozzarella blend. A little bit of shredded, fresh basil was scattered on the whole pizza, and the amount of tomato sauce on top wasn&#39;t excessive; it was balanced very, very well.

The place is really easy to miss driving by Old Town Bloomingdale on Lake Street, but for the best thin crust in this part of the suburbs, take your time to find Pizzeria Antica."

Yelp to the rescue!  We decided to give Pizzeria Antica a whirl and are glad that we did.  The pizza is top notch!  They are far from perfect to be sure but the pizza really shines.
We started off with an arugula salad that was a large plate of arugula and 4 cherry tomatoes and a prepackaged packet of balsamic dressing.  Not very creative although the packaged dressing was actually pretty good.  It would have been nice if they had done a bit more with the salad though.
We ordered a medium &#34;Barese&#34; which includes prosciutto, panna, fresh ground pepper, shaved Parmesan and topped with fresh arugula and virgin olive oil.  Although they do not have a brick oven, this was as good as any artisan pizza that I have had.  Yes, you can order your typical sausage, mushroom, etc pizzas as well.  We enjoy trying the artisan pizzas with fancy Italian names and have never been disappointed.  Pizzeria Antica does not disappoint when it comes to their specialty pizzas.
As has been noted in previous reviews, Pizzeria Antica is a tiny place with a half dozen tables.  It&#39;s clean and the young lady serving us was attentive.  They have limited beer and wine offerings.  Maybe 4 bottled beers priced at $4 or $5.  (But, they do have Peroni.)  They have a handful of wines priced similarly and they are served in small juice glasses.  My guess is that they are a 4 or 5 ounce pour.  Sorry, but at $4 or $5, this isn&#39;t a good value.  I asked the server for a GLASS of water and she brought me a bottled water.  Oh...OK, but then she charged us a buck.  (Minor issue.)
We had a salad, medium pizza, one beer and 4 glasses of wine and the bill came to $51.  If the pizza hadn&#39;t been so well executed, I would have downgraded them to 3 stars.  
One last point; they are located northwest of the intersection of Bloomingdale Rd &amp; Lake St.  Be careful, don&#39;t blink, you&#39;ll blow right by it.  Also, you can only enter their parking lot heading west on Lake Street.  
I can live with the minor &#34;nits&#34; that I picked above.  Really good pizza and I know we will be back."

Just like Zia Nina made back in the day (fresh tomatoes from the yard, basement setup to roll the dough and fry/bake enough Panzerottis for an entire month).  Pizza was 100% perfect as well.

We drove the pizza back to our place so the crust was not as crispy as I would have liked. But overall, it was just ok. I didn&#39;t find that the sausage had much in the way of anything unique. The pepperoni was standard, and not cooked enough either. 

The sauce was very basic. Bright red, basic sauce with not alot of pizazz. 

I&#39;d like to try some of their other items. I will re-review when I do. But in general, this pizza just didn&#39;t make the grade for us."

Panzerotti Classico Baked - Very yummy!
Panzerotti Barese Fried - Also very yummy, although greasier
Fried Platter - very respectable; highlights are the fried ravioli and the jalapeno poppers
Caprese - I&#39;ve never had this before, only bruschetta, but I really like it

I&#39;ll definitely be back to try the pizza one day."

It is tiny, 5 tables total, but it does not even feel like a restaurant; feels more like your Italian relatives&#39; house (If I had Italian relatives I would hope they cooked like this).  Boyfriend and I came here because we had a groupon and we will definitely be returning.  Started out with the bruschetta and it was amazing!! I seriously could have eaten a plate of the bruschetta for dinner and been satisfied.  The pizza is perfect, not too greasy and I love that they make their own cheese.  My bf, a self-proclaimed pizza snob who hates thin crust, really loved their pizza (he ate more than half!)  I noticed that everyone besides us had the panzerotti, so I realized this must be Pizzeria Antica&#39;s specialty and I was bummed I didn&#39;t try it.  

We were the only patrons who did not know the owners, but they definitely made us feel welcome. Service was friendly and pretty fast and you can see the kitchen, so you know the food is being made from scratch.  Can&#39;t wait to try the panzerotti next time!"

When Pizzeria Antica opened, I gave them a few months, but after being open for over a year, I finally tried them and loved the plain cheese pizza.

They offer it Tuesday through Friday in a single-slice lunch format and I have to say, it&#39;s VERY good, but expensive at $3.00 per slice versus $2.00 at other joints. The crust is thin and sturdy, the sauce is provided in an amount that you barely notice it, and the cheese is very firmly melted, but still a bit greasy (I love this sort of combination for on-the-go pizza since you can easily hold the rather large slice in one hand). Quite honestly, it&#39;s extremely delicious and for some reason, ordering a large cheese pizza instead of a single slice around lunchtime usually comes out differently- less baking time perhaps for the large, fresher whole pizza? Not sure.

Their sides are also quite generous; I got nearly twice the cheese sticks (about 8) versus the four I usually get at other eateries and their fried ravioli are quite a treat (tomato sauce on the side was a bit watery, I should note).

I&#39;m afraid to try other stuff from here, as it previously caused me to give a 2-star rating... So, I&#39;m just sticking to the stuff that is GREAT and I&#39;ll be happy with the place."

How often do you go to an Italian pizzeria where you can find that either the staff or the clientele are actually FROM Italy?  The panzerotte Barese is the one to order:  fresh mozzarella!!  Their pizzas are excellent too, but we can&#39;t resist ordering the panzerotte every time we go.  Worth traveling for."

I could get the same panini, double the size at Panera for that price. No parking space. So many people waited around in the cramped up space for a table, and finally left cause they weren&#39;t entertained. They need to staff more people in, and reduce their food prices."

I&#39;ve had the antico pizza, the panzerotti, a pepperoni slice, italian beef, the caprese appetizer, the garlic bread, and the cornetto nutella.  Recently I had their barese pizza on several occasions.  It was delicious, and nothing like I&#39;ve had before.
