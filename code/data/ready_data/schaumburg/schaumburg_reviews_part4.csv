We ordered a small Malnati Chicago Classic with pepperoni and a family size house salad. The pizza takes about 30 minutes or more to cook, so I recommend ordering an appetizer. The house salad was huge, could feed 6 people easily. After snacking on that, the pizza came out just as we were get antsy. It was perrrrrrfect. Crispy, gooey, doughy, meaty, saucy, everythingy. I&#39;ve literally never had anything like it before. A small was enough to feed both of us with a slice leftover. 

Y&#39;all, I don&#39;t know why the waitress didn&#39;t tell us that the family size salad was going to be huge when we ordered it, especially when it was just us two. But when we ordered a small pizza she tried to push us to get a medium. Just sayin&#39;, she could have warned us. 

Overall, I would highly recommend trying this iconic place if you&#39;re visiting! I wish they had a Lou Malnati&#39;s in Austin so I can indulge more often!"

We went at about 8 pm on a Thursday night and it was a bit crowded at first. The service was a bit slow even though the crowd had seemed to die down. 
Over all the food was great, and we enjoyed the festive Halloween decorations and the Cubs decorations! 
I would defiantly return here... so much crispier getting a pizza at the restaurant vs bringing it home."

We didn&#39;t come back for that long because back then the sausage was an entire layer.  Don&#39;t remember if it was deep dish or thin crust but anyway, my opinion has changed.

We ordered a thin crust sausage and mushroom 15 minutes in advance to cut down on the time.  Then when we arrived we ordered the combination platter appetizer.  When we sat down, we started the timer. (many said makes no difference if you order ahead)  Well 35 minutes later the pizza came.

Summary, Pizza and appetizer was very good, we&#39;ll definitely return on that note.  Very good flavor on the pizza.  Combo platter was also very good,
Service was a bit slow, I would still order in advance, maybe they just prep the pie but don&#39;t put it in until you show.
The porch is very loud, everyone was shouting at the table just to hear each other talk.  Next time we do the dining room.

We will definitely return."

I finally came back to the Chicagoland area after having moved 6 years ago. Lou Malnati&#39;s is my favorite pizza. The crust is perfect, the tomatoes and sauce and the toppings.

For years, my friend had sent me Lou Malnatis pizza in the mail through TastesofChicago.com. I finally got to eat it with her in person.

This Lou Malnatis location has gotten bigger since I last was here. They have a new outside addition. Very nice.

My deep dish pizza did not disappoint whatsoever. We got green peppers and pepperoni. I also had some of their salad. All were heaven.

Our server was terrific. She brought me a birthday dessert. Crazy how something simple as pizza can make me utterly happy. It sure did!

So happy to celebrate my pre-birthday here. I also did make sure to get Lou Malnati&#39;s again before I left Chicago."

1 word BUTTERCRUST! I did not buy into this for many years, but my palate has slowly shifted away from Gino&#39;s East and I think that I have fallen head over heels for the Lou. This is essential one stop shop for deep dish pizza. Although it is not a stuffed pizza like Giordano&#39;s you cannot go wrong with a crispy butter flavored crust with large sausage patties. I only recently discovered the beauty of ordering ahead. Forget about waiting 30-40 minutes for your pizza. If you know you are going for lunch, call ahead so they can have your pizza firing in the oven before before you arrive! You won&#39;t go wrong if you try this place. 

Pros: Chicago&#39;s Best Deep dish, buttercrust

Cons: Long wait times for pizza to cook, if you show up later you may have to wait even longer for a seat!

Hidden deals:
The Lou includes the butter crust without the additional cost"

But coming back here always cheers me up. Good beer selection, great pizza, good wings and a big family style restaurant. We arrived for an early lunch and got their special, which was a small deep dish personal pizza and a drink. Not a bad deal. 

After a little bit they started moving tables together and sure enough an entire basketball or soccer team came in and sat right in our area. Considering the restaurant wasn&#39;t crowded it was kind of irritating they didn&#39;t seat them elsewhere. So it was extremely loud from then out.

My last time here, we had a similar problem in the covered sun-room seating area. The sound echoed and it was extremely hard to hold a conversation.
So if you come here for lunch or dinner, be prepared to yell and repeat yourself a few times."

This time I was in town for business and brought a co-worker along with me. Now mind you, he is a 6&#39;4 230lbs dude but I still warned him that there would be a lot of food. He insisted that he was going to &#34;plow&#34; some food though. Needless to say, he ordered his own medium pizza with both sausage and pepperoni (this is overkill in my opinion. And I swear years ago you could only get one or he other), a pasta dish and a salad...you should have seen his eyes when the brought it all out.  There was no way he was eating all that. At least the company was flipping the bill.  Since he didn&#39;t want to split a pizza I decided to get a medium pepperoni and salad myself knowing I&#39;d take pizza back to the hotel with me.  

Everything was excellent as always!  This was my first time at this location but it was clean, the staff was friendly and attentive and the quality was as I&#39;ve come to expect. If you are looking for a good Chicago Deep Dish in the area, look no further!"

We ordered a large pizza with sausages, pepperoni, and mushrooms. Between four girls, we couldn&#39;t finish it. It was delicious in that the pizza was really good but the crust was super thick to me and I decided maybe deep dish isn&#39;t exactly my cup of tea. It started getting really heavy in the end and we just couldn&#39;t do it.

Minestrone soup - 2 days to develop rich taste

Leinie&#39;s Summer Shanty- light blond ale with refreshing almost citrus notes. Great for a hot summer day. They offer 8 beers in draft. 

I noticed that they serve Rodney Strong Cabernet by the glass.

Butter crust is phenomenal. Sauce is rich and the topping (Italian sausage and mushrooms) are perfect.

Their minestrone was really good but the star of the show is of course their pizza which is on lists as best in Chicago area and usa.

We&#39;d read about the crust being buttery and my husband said their crust wasn&#39;t usually so crunchy.  All know is it was VERY crunchy and I really liked it. The chunky sauce is on top of the cheese so the crust didn&#39;t get all soggy and gross. I really liked it and would totally go back if In the area."

We were too tired this trip so we asked our hotel clerk for a recommendation and she raved about Lou Malnati&#39;s. I called to make a reservation and they have a strange process - you pre-order your deep dish for a specific time and show up. Then you are kind of priority seated.

When we arrived our waitress, Alma, greeted us and that is when we had our best dining experience EVER. The pizza was very good but Alma was the highlight. She spoke to my Down&#39;s brother by name, hugged him and asked him what he wanted. You probably don&#39;t understand how truly exceptional this is. My brother glowed. Alma kept all of the beverages filled, checked on us regularly but didn&#39;t hover and engaged Larry with every trip to the table. 

The The Malnati Chicago Classic (Lou&#39;s lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust) was very good. My only complaint was that the sauce had a slight canned aftertaste. The sausage had great flavor and the buttercrust was excellent. I also added olives and garlic. MMMMMMMMMMMM

The spaghetti and meatballs and meatball sandwich were heartily recommended by the men in our group. Tiramisu for dessert capped a perfect evening. 

As I watched Alma with other customers I was impressed with how warm and engaging her service was. Our first trip to Lou Malnati&#39;s and we lucked into a fantastic server with a warm heart.

Today was the day and I was quite excited to try it out, to be honest.

I have to mention a couple of very important things:
1) I hate crust.
2) I decided a long time ago when I first tried deep dish that I hated them due to the doughy consistency of the deep dish pizzas I have tried from places supposedly known for deep dish.

I started with the Malnati salad which had a wonderful flavor overall. Then the Lou Malnati pizza which was actually not bad. The crust isn&#39;t as doughy. It was more crisp and thin underneath and the pizza wasn&#39;t swimming in sauce as I have previously experienced in the past with deep dish pizzas.

So the crust did not overwhelm me and it actually worked. The pizza wasn&#39;t extra saucy but it was quite cheesy. I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way but when you take a slice, a whole entourage of cheese wants to come along. Nevertheless, it was good pizza!

I found it to be flavourless and too hard.  It tasted almost like a frozen pizza.  The tomato sauce was also too salty.

When we were taken back to our tables, the area was set and ready, with bowl of house salad and dressings along with pitchers of soda and ice water already on the tables.

Along with the pizza, bowls of penne pasta with marinara sauce were brought to the table. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce had good flavor. The staff even offered to bring us a different sauce if we preferred. After everyone had their fill of salad, pizza and pasta, we had the fresh fruit platter. While all the fruit was good and tasty, the pineapple was sweeter and juicier than you usually find anywhere.

As far as the staff and service, the group that they had waiting on us were all extremely polite and willing to go out of their way to make sure we all were happy. Between offering to bring us slices of pizza to quickly clearing away any finished plates, they were quick on their feet, always with a smile! KUDOS to Lou&#39;s for their delicious food, excellent service and helping make my niece&#39;s special weekend one to remember!"

That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying if you disagree you&#39;re wrong lol.  I&#39;m a self-proclaimed pizza snob and the deep dish here is worth the drive from another town, or the wait if you decide to eat in. My favorite is spinach with pepperoni.   

The parking can be a little tight especially during peak hours but I wouldn&#39;t fault this place for that, because you can always find a spot, you just may have to walk a little bit.

Eating inside is nice, the place is very clean, the staff is quite accommodating.  The pricing is expected for this level of quality."

There aren&#39;t any around my usual stomping grounds, and my girlfriend had talked it up quite a bit.  The parking at this location is a little inadequate, so make sure you show up with time to find a spot.
     We ordered a deep dish with green peppers and pepperoni.  When our pizza arrived, our server informed us that they had accidentally made it with green peppers, pepperoni, and onions.  She asked if this was ok, and despite my dislike of onions we told her it was fine (the girlfriend can&#39;t get enough onions, so she was thrilled).  I tried a slice, and despite the onions it was pretty good.  A couple moments later, the manager came out and informed us that she was having another pizza brought out (made to match our original order).
     After a couple more minutes, our second pizza was brought out.  I have to say, that it was delicious.  Not quite worth the wait, but very good.  Usually, I&#39;d be subtracting stars due to the service errors that occurred here.  However, I appreciate that the staff tried very hard to make up for it, and at the end of the night we got two pizzas for the price of one.  And my date even got her beloved onions!"

The deep dish though seemed deeper last time I visited the area because I was able to chomp down a slice with only my hands. Alfredo was rich and loaded with white chicken strips and salad had a ton of ingredients to truly make it an original item.
  Post meal though I experienced an hour of toilet time directly related to one of the items just consumed obviously. This won&#39;t deter anybody I know from going to a legendary place, but just a heads up with my experience and a few of my co-workers."

I would have given this place probably 4 stars but I had to drop it down to 2 due to my delivery experience tonight. 

Everyone orders delivery from pizza places, and their drivers always have change, right?  Wrong!  My total bill for my order #295 made on 2/25/2016 at around 7pm was $24.28.  The delivery guy came and I had two $20 bills; no other sized bills in my wallet.  I always tip well, usually between $5 and $10.  So as I handed over the $40, I asked for $10 back, which would be a $5.72 tip.  Well, I ended up tipping him more because when I asked for $10 back he said, &#34;sorry I have no cash on me, I can&#39;t give any change&#34;.  I didn&#39;t feel like arguing and I had nothing but some change inside, so I just gave him the $40 and said, &#34;well it&#39;s your lucky night, $15.72 tip, have a good one!&#34;... Now I am a nice guy like that, but, I find it extremely odd that a food delivery person would have NO change, not even a couple bucks?  Not sure if it&#39;s some type of scam he plays to get more tips, or if he was honest.  He seemed like a nice guy so I&#39;ll give him the benefit of the doubt.  But, this location needs to make sure their delivery drivers have change!

Sadly, I will now only order from this place when I have an abundance of different bills in my wallet.  If I only have $20&#39;s and my bill is around $25, I&#39;ll have to order from elsewhere."

I have to say that I was not disappointed and that I had the best deep-dish pizza from my time in Chicago there, even if it is a chain.

First, their pizzas aren&#39;t very expensive for what they are and they are very good. They take a long time to make your pizza, but I guess it is necessary to get a good one. The service was otherwise fast and efficient.

This location does offer parking, and it does not seem to get too crowded, even during the rush hour. The restaurant was pretty packed when we got there, but we didn&#39;t have to wait to be seated.

This isn&#39;t necessarily the coolest or most unique place to go. It&#39;s big and and clearly fined-tuned to service a lot of people craving some delish deep dish. 

From my 2 experiences, if you go here you are going to need a reservation. If not, be prepared to wait 30 minutes which goes by quick. Espec if you grab a drink at the bar!

Oh yeah, the bar. It sucks. Just because a drink is kind of expensive doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to be good. This isn&#39;t the sort of place you want to try something new....

Getting back to the nuts and bolts of this review, the pizza is the bomb. You can put your order in when you put your name in making your wait-time much shorter. This means you can start nommin&#39; shortly after being seated. The crust is what makes the pizza come full circle...it&#39;s buttery and flavorful. Like, I looooove the crust. It&#39;s quite addicting. LM goes for more sauce than cheese which is my groove. Some people like the cheesy route but not his CM.

Celebrating my sister&#39;s birthday, called to make reservations for 10. Apparently, 10 is too low a number. Was told we could order the pizza before we arrived to be seated quicker--don&#39;t think I&#39;ll call the other 9 in our party in the middle of the day to ask them what they want to eat at 6p, but, hey, maybe that&#39;s just me. So our party of 10, including an 85 year old that walks with difficulty and the use of a cane, along with a toddler, arrived and were then told an hour or more wait. We agreed to wait, and then watched as four other parties within about 15 minutes handed their pagers back and walked out. We ordered our pizzas while standing in the entryway. Had I known we would be ordering standing up, I would&#39;ve suggested Portillo&#39;s down the road. We finally are seated over an hour later. We order appetizers. Imagine my surprise when the arrival of the appetizers are so very quickly followed by the pizza that would be &#34;timed&#34; appropriately...not so much. And best yet, the pizza, normally still steaming when it arrives as on previous occasions, was not hot. Barely luke warm. Spoke to a manager to express my disappointment. Was told, &#34;Well, we have to follow guidelines.&#34; I get it. I&#39;ve been in the service industry for over 25+ years. I make exceptions everyday. I have never felt more rushed trying to enjoy a family get together. We literally waited longer for our table then we sat together and ate. I&#39;ve been to this location with large parties before, and made reservations, and they&#39;ve charged me $50 before I even walk in to hold the reservation.

Once arriving here, we elected the option of outdoor rooftop seating, which is perfect for the sunny day we were enjoying in Chicago. We ended up with a couple of appetizers, and a large Chicago Classic Deep Dish. The Portions here are quite generous - the salad I had myself could&#39;ve been dinner for two people. It was quite tasty, and from what my co-workers have stated. 

With regards to the pizza itself, it was served by the table in a large metal tin with the waitress freshly cutting the pizza at the table, and serving the slices out. I remember that the pizza itself had a generous amount of the sausage on top of the pizza, and the tomato sauce had chunks of tomatoes in it, which had a nice textural contrast with the rest of the pizza. But those who know me will know that I&#39;m indifferent with deep dish pizza, as I don&#39;t care for that much cheese. 

That being said - I did enjoy my slice of pizza here; the service was excellent, and friendly and the venue is obviously popular. While we were leaving, the dinner crowd arrived and the venue started to become a packed house quickly.

The delivery man was nice and friendly. I have been to different Lou Malnati&#39;s, so I knew it will be good. I ordered two deep dish pizzas (one sausage and one sausage and pepperoni) and one thin crust pizza which was just cheese. The thin crust cheese was okay but not great. The flavor wasn&#39;t as good. The deep dish is THE BEST in Chicago pizza I&#39;ve ever had. The flavor is amazing, and the crust is crunchy and it&#39;s great! The sauce, sausage, and pepperoni have great tastes! All in all, great staff and amazing food. I will come back!"

Leave me alone with a large pizza and I shall terminate that in one sitting all by myself. I am a champ so I stay away. I hadnt been to Lou&#39;s in forever, mainly because I have no self control. My foreign family wanted to try deep dish pizza so I couldn&#39;t think of a better place to go. 
We went Saturday night and only waited 20 minutes. Got sat in the back room and our server came right away. He was personable, efficient and kept us informed about the Hawks game throughout the whole dinner. Loved it.
The pizza was great. We ordered 2 medium pizzas, one veggie and one pepperoni. Both were great and the crust was to die for. It was so filling we had to take 70 percent home. My only complaint is that the mushrooms in my black olive and mushroom pizza were canned and not fresh. I dealt with it but I guess I expect more from LM. 
Can&#39;t wait to cheat again in my diet and stuff my face at Lou Malnati&#39;s. Thumbs up"

I ordered an individual (6 inch) Malnati Chicago Classic, which comes with lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on buttercrust. 

And let me take a second to say how happy I was that they have individual pizzas. The size was probably comparable to one and a half giant pieces of pizza pie that you would get out of a regular deep dish. And the small pizza definitely filled me up and seemed just as deep as a normal deep dish pizza. 

And the taste was &#34;authentic Chicago&#34; as the menu claims.

So why just four stars? I think most people are partial to their first deep dish experience, and for me that&#39;s Gino&#39;s East. I feel like Gino&#39;s deep dish is perhaps more flavorful and cheesy. But I know this is very subjective, and please don&#39;t douse me with Hatorade over this. 

Lou Malnati&#39;s was delicious and I hope to get to go back and perhaps be swayed to have a new deep dish favorite."

Came to Lou Malnati to see what all the hype was about. Came in and sat at the bar. Bar provides full menu service. Which. Is awesome. Ordered myself a beer (only $4.75 by the way) and browsed the menu. Eyes went straight to The Malnati Chicago Classic. 

Prior to the arrival of my pizza I was given a knife and fork. At first I thought maybe they have a salad bar or something. When I asked, the bartender said &#34;you must not be from around here..... it&#39;s fa ya pizza&#34;

Pizza came (I ordered a small so I can have some to go) WOW. Pretty good size pizza for being a &#34;small&#34; bartender sliced and plated my pizza. I went to town. First bite. NO WORDS. The crust. The cheese. The tomatoes (not sauce) The sausage. Everything. AMAZING. I finished my slice and sat back to just savor all the delicious-ness of the pizza. Bartender came back and said &#34;you ready for another slice?&#34; 

I gave in and started the second slice. The flavors are just toooooooo perfect. I can&#39;t even describe it. Probably theeeeeee best pizza EVER. Hat&#39;s off to Lou Malnati."

I LOVE their Personal Deep Dish Deluxe pizzas, which are not on the menu anymore, yet they are available--sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green pepper--DELICIOUS!! 
I prefer the House Salad over the Malnati Salad: Iceberg and Romaine lettuce, red cabbage, carrots, roma tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions and croutons. Medium $5.45  |  Family size $10.25 (A gluten-free option when served without croutons.)
Housemade Salad Dressings: House Red Wine Vinaigrette, Thousand Island, Creamy Lemon Garlic, Gorgonzola, and Reduced-Calorie Ranch. My favorite dressing is the Creamy Lemon Garlic, then the House Red Wine Vinaigrette. I always get two or three dressings when I order this.

1) Creamy.Garlic.Dressing: Get this delicious dressing on (or on the side of) any salad. Do not breath on anyone for at least 12 hours. 

2) They deliver! Yes indeed. They even deliver a cookie pizza that is king when it comes to desserts. 

3) Lou Special deep dish is the way to go: Spinach, sliced tomatoes, mushrooms (I am anti-fungii, so I typically ask for them to leave these off), and cheddar, romano, and mozzarella cheese. Perfection.

First the smoothie, wow was this horrible, their blender is probably super old and not sharpened, cuase I had some chunks of ice in there that kept getting stuck in the straw. It was a coconut smoothie but the flavor was lacking tasted like water ice and some coconut milk mixed together but mostly water. It was just way too watery to call it a smoothie, sine smoothies are supposed to be a bit thick and creamy, this was watered down juice.

The other thing I got was orange chicken with white rice. The look of it looked good, it was 5 or 6 big pieces of meat with 2 stalks of broccoli. The sauce was nice and had orange flavor to it but it was so thick. The broccoli and rice were fine, but the chicken when you bite into it is crispy, but the meat they use.... Ewww.  On the inside some prices were fine and white others looked like they were sitting out all day for maybe a couple days, all greyed out and black I ended up choosing not to eat those prices and so I only had 3 pieces of chicken.

I have been looking for a replacement and decided to give 7 Luck a try last Saturday. 

My wife and I each tried one of our standards -  sweet and sour shrimp for my wife and Mongolian beef for me.  And egg rolls. Plus, a large order of pork fried rice. 

One thing we immediately noticed is that the egg rolls are larger than most places. And, they have a spice that is not common for the dish.  It may have been allspice.  It was an interesting addition and quite good. 

The Mongolian beef was tasty. Again, the recipe is a bit different but very acceptable. I did miss the cellophane noodle topping that most places provide.  But the flavor was quite good and made up for the missing noodles. 

The sweet and sour was pretty standard.  But the sauce wasn&#39;t heated enough to be fully liquid and had a jelly like texture. A minute in the microwave solved that.  I&#39;m assuming this was not the normal way the restaurant serves the sauce.   On the plus side, the pineapple in the sauce seemed fresh rather than canned. 

The fried rice also was pretty standard. Maybe it had a few less vegetables than I have seen elsewhere. 

One thing to note is that each entree came with a serving of egg drop soup.  I have never been a big fan of the dish, but I tried it.  It was about the same as every other time I tried it. 

So, summing up,  7 Luck is a decent neighborhood place for take out (they also deliver.)  I will explore the menu further.  But I may try other places too rather than making this my forever Chinese take out."

Compared to some of the other Chinese Food places I&#39;ve checked out on Yelp recently this place hands down is better than all of them. The flavors and portion sizes are great, and I&#39;m never disappointed.  The only time that I&#39;m ever disappointed is when I realize that EVERYTHING on my plate is fried, but that&#39;s my fault not there&#39;s.  I should stop ordering crab rangoon, fried rice, and sweet and sour chicken.  

They are always nice when you order and when I&#39;m slammed for time and call 10 minutes before closing they still take my order which is really great!

It wasn&#39;t good, but then again it wasn&#39;t bad. With the wide selection of potential places to order in Schaumburg, this was just one of those places that fell into our rotation.

Not anymore. 

We ordered in from them this past Sunday. My wife ordering salt and pepper shrimp and I getting my regular General Tso&#39;s Chicken dinner special. All was going well as I started digging in until about the 5th bite into my fried rice, I noticed something odd looking in my food. It definitely didn&#39;t belong.

After rolling it over with my fork for a few moments, it clicked in my head that there was the seared remains of an insect in my food. Specifically a beetle that looked like the last moments of it&#39;s life had been nestled in rice, green onions and bits of scrambled egg before making it&#39;s way to my styrofoam container and into my home. 

Immediately fighting the urge to throw up in my mouth, I had my wife check her food, hoping she could at least finish her meal. Not so. There was half of another insect in her food causing her to collect every last bit of food and throw it in the trash as I called the establishment. 

After explaining the situation, the manager of the place was initially willing to offer me a 15% or 20% discount on our next meal, wrongly assuming there would be a next time. I retorted that I wanted a full refund and was told I&#39;d need to come in. I packed up my bug food and headed over. Upon showing them the contents of my meal, they retorted that it was, &#34;nasty&#34;, and proceeded to apologize profusely. Nasty indeed.

They happily refunded the full balance of what we&#39;d paid for the meal, but the damage is still done. Sure, I would love to patronize a place that&#39;d offered run-of-the-mill food and did so relatively well, but mentally, it&#39;s always going to be that place where a bug was in my food. For that, I can&#39;t condone ordering from them anymore."

The food is awful. My husband and I just ordered take out, and we are disgusted. They got my order completely wrong (gave me orange chicken instead of sesame chicken) and my husband&#39;s kung pao was literally inedible. All of the food is the same consistency, even the vegetables: mushy, cold, soggy, overcooked, and gross. I called and complained and she was very nice, offered me a free meal, but I will never go back."

I called in the order for delivery. I gave my credit card number and she kept saying it was declined. I called the cc company and they told me because the expiration date was entered wrong both times. I only had to repeat myself three times! This irritated me but I still proceeded with my order. 

Fast delivery! We were told 40 minutes but within 20 minutes our food arrived. Ordered the Mongolian beef but couldn&#39;t eat it because it was sweet to me. My husband had Shrimp with lobster sauce and couldn&#39;t eat his dish because it was extremely salty. We both had tummy aches from the crab rangoon/egg rolls.

The food was flavorful, but there were some problems. I ordered the sesame tofu dish for $9. It featured a wonderful savory, sweet and slightly spicy sauce. However, the tofu was spoiled and the broccoli was overcooked. I called them about the spoilage and they were willing to make me a new one, which had good tofu and much greener broccoli, and was totally delicious. If only I didn&#39;t have to drive back to get it, argh.

The egg foo young was good, though the gravy was lumpy. Will likely give them another try; hopefully this was just a bad day for them.

The food was ready reasonably quickly, and I chose to pick it up from within the store. It was ready and waiting when I retrieved it, and the staff was quick to give me the order.

Unfortunately, the food was of poor quality. I had ordered the orange chicken (spicy), crab rangoon, and received a free egg roll because of the coupon they offer via Grubhub. Every item had a rather bad aftertaste, as though the oil in the fryer was bad.

The filling in the crab rangoon actually had large chunks of crab meat in it, which is nice compared to other services in the area that serve their rangoons with 99% cream cheese and little specks of crab meat. Unfortunately, the dough had the bad aftertaste mentioned above, which ruined the rangoon experience overall.

Once again, the egg roll filling was excellent, but the wrapping had the poor aftertaste.

The aftertaste continued with the orange chicken, which was more the neon-red color you&#39;d expect to see on hot wings than your normal orange chicken appearance. Looks were deceiving though, and the chicken was pleasingly spicy, not overly hot, but not overly weak either. In this case though, it could&#39;ve used a bit more kick to drown out the aftertaste.

Overall, I would probably try this place once more, as their base ingredients seem to be quality, but the finished product&#39;s quality seems to be based on if they remembered to clean the fryer or not."

You have been warned.

If you can, enter by the tire section, don&#39;t turn by strip mall by Giordano&#39;s.  You pull in that way, you are going to be waiting forever to get through the hell that is Wal-Mart.  And don&#39;t go searching for a spot either, just park, walking is good for all of us and lets be honest, gas is really expensive.  (Sams Club price is pretty decent though).

Anywho... really nice inside, workers are usually really friendly and during the weekends, samples galore.  They are starting to have more specials on certain products and more boxes around to pack your items in if you don&#39;t have bags.

Food and supplies in bulk sums up your experience at Sams. Although many people find that Sam&#39;s club allows you to save when you buy in bulk, I find that careful review of weekly ads nets you the same product for cheaper. Now you may ask why I even have a Sam&#39;s club membership. I ended up getting one before my wedding in order to stock up on certain products in bulk for the wedding party. That being said, the store is great for the one time buy items which can be super cheap like 60 packs of welch gummies for 3 dollars and other items that cannot be found elsewhere (giant breakfast muffins etc). Overall prices are average and you still need to pay for membership. It is a great place if you have a restaurant or store that you need to load up on bulk goods that you can resell for a profit. 

Pros: Bulk goods that are great for selling individual units for profit, one of a kind items that are cheap, wide selection of food products and free sampling of foods. Cheap fast food (hot dog combo, pizza, slurpees!)

Cons: membership fees subtracts from the discount. Long lines on the weekend. No bags to carry your items, but you can use old boxes to store em!

Hidden deals: If you have a home business, you can sign up for 35 dollars instead of 40. Also college students can sign up for cheaper (i forgot the price), but you get a free 15 dollar gift card to offset the cost."

There are a ton of shady characters outside ((cough-cough-connected-to-Walmart-cough-cough)) and parking is a JOKE.

Costco has a few more upscale items but bottom line is if I want a box of 5000 waffles or eighteen gallons of creamer, it really doesn&#39;t matter where I go and if I can drive less, all the better.

The only thing Sam&#39;s Club doesn&#39;t have over Costco, besides a lot of annoying white people, are coupons. Costco has some really outstanding coupons, Sam&#39;s Club doesn&#39;t. But aside from that? 

Sam&#39;s Club sells TVs, computers, ground beef by the metric ton and industrial sized sacks of rice. You save a bit by buying volume, most of the time. Beware stuff like soda as you&#39;ll end up paying more than if you just buy it at the grocery store when it&#39;s on sale. Shop smart. Er."

While I was entertained by the thought of Portillo&#39;s grilled tuna sandwich (pretty tasty), Stav&#39;s was another choice, both being in my direction.

Suffice to say, I gave in to the gyro since I hadn&#39;t had one in a very, very long time.   I&#39;ve never tried one from Stav&#39;s, so I pulled in, placed my order which came with soup or coleslaw (I chose the lemon rice soup) and grabbed a homemade &#39;spinach pie&#39; also.  NO this is not a whole pie.  It&#39;s a small rectangular shaped spanakopita, if you will.  And I love these.  (the owners are Greek, by the way...)

Since everything is cooked to order here &amp; I didn&#39;t call in advance, I had to wait approximately 10 minutes for my food to be ready.  Didn&#39;t bother me at all...no big deal.  The gyros plate included fries, 1 pita and lots of thinly sliced fresh meat...probably some of the better gyro meat I have tasted at any Greek or fast food joint. And this beats Franky&#39;s on Lake hands down!  Meat was not greasy, salty or grossly thick.  Not heavy.  Just really tasty, moist &amp; fresh with my perfectly grilled soft, tender pita and tzatziki....delish!  They even included extra tzatziki (a little &#39;thin&#39;, but tasty). 

 After eating half, I decided to move along to my lemon rice soup.  If you&#39;ve never had it before it is a thicker Greek soup.  They give you a good serving...almost a small soup bowl&#39;s worth.  I&#39;ve had it here before and this time it was even better.  Lemony, velvety, smooth - almost custard like, with rice.  This was delicious.  Since this soup is made with eggs (hence, &#39;custard like&#39;) it did not taste eggy in the least.  Yumminess without feeling &#39;heavy or grossly &#39;thick&#39;.  Perfect consistency.   Had just one bite of my spinach pie and it was OK.  I&#39;ve had better.  Was filled w/lots of spinach wrapped in phyllo, but needed more feta imo.  Not bad at all though.  

Stav&#39;s has an extensive fast food list, and I&#39;ve tried the kebabs (good), ribs (surprisingly good) and gyros (very good) so far...If your in the mood for fast Greek food, I&#39;d stick to Stav&#39;s where you know the Greek owners are doin the cookin!

No offense Stav&#39;s, but the next time we meet, it will have to be for a chicken kebab!  No more gyros for me for awhile!! ;)  ps.  they also serve pork souvlaki...wonder what that tastes like?"

We both got the gyros plate with salad. I read another review, which said that Stav&#39;s doesn&#39;t skimp on the meat. They were right! We both got a lot of meat. There was so much meat that we could have used an extra pita. The tzatziki sauce was watery and not too flavorful.  We were excited to get the salads because we both really like Greek salads. Unfortunately, the salads were just garden salads.  We wish we knew that so we could have ordered Greek salads.

Usually I go to Billy&#39;s on Addison Rd or Yorky&#39;s but was on Lake &amp; Rt 53 so I decided to give Stav a try.  Wrong decision on my part.  Maybe they have other items on menu that taste good but my review is strictly on chicken breast plate I ordered.  The chicken was dry and it was thin sliced so I&#39;m surprised that was messed up.  You can tell it&#39;s not marinated enough to get any Greek flavor they just douse chicken breast with a bunch of oregano.  Rice was watery and I had water bottom of my to go container to confirm that.  Greek potato&#39;s were OK nothing special.  

If your in mood for Chicken Breast Plate don&#39;t go he head to Billy&#39;s.  They slice little lines across chicken breast to make sure marinated juice soak in it.  Yorky&#39;s in Elmhurst is my 2nd choice."

She ordered the Grilled Tilapia and I had the Shish-Ka-Bob Beef Plate.    As sides I ordered a grape leaf and baklava.   I also had Lemon Rice Soup.

Delivery was pretty timely...about 25 minutes after placing order.

The food from the main dishes were plentiful.   My friend enjoyed the tilapia despite wanting to have it fried which wasn&#39;t offered on menu.    My beef plate had plenty of beef and rice along with sliced potato pieces to put on my gyro bread.   It was all very tasty.

The lemon rice soup was okay though I would&#39;ve preferred the lentil.    When I ordered the soup with beef plate it didn&#39;t specify which soup you would get.    Next time I&#39;ll specify a different soup.

Neither my friend nor I liked the grape leaf.    I was glad we only ordered the one.    I think it would&#39;ve tasted better warm as opposed to cold.    The only other place I tried grape leaves was when I dined at Anita&#39;s Kitchen in Ferndale, MI.   And they served them nice and warm.

The baklava was definitely another highlight.   It&#39;s one of those desserts that will give you quite the sugar high from all the layers of honey.   The bottom layer is pretty much soaked in it completely.    An excellent dessert to have once in a blue moon.

The hits far outweigh the misses with the food...hence the 4 stars.

Look forward to ordering more from this place."

I love that they have healthy options. Whenever I&#39;m on a diet, I make a habit of getting the chicken breast wrap with no vinaigrette with tzatziki sauce (cucumber sauce they use for gyros) on the side. I think I calculated the rough calories before and it&#39;s less than a subway sub and a little more hearty. Delicious in my opinion.

I&#39;ve had some other dishes from there before, the pork souvlaki and the gyro, decent enough. 

Their salads are really big and filling!

I believe they deliver, but it&#39;s a bit too expensive a delivery charge in my opinion. I used to order for lunch until they raised the delivery price.

The outside and overall design of the restaurant remind me of a Wendy&#39;s. In visiting Stav&#39;s I decided to try the hot dog.

The hot dog I received came on a dry non-poppy seed bun. There were huge chunks of tomato and a large and very thick pickle slice on the sandwich. There was about three hot dogs worth of mustard on this hot dog with strangely chopped slices of onion and very little relish. There was no sign of celery salt on this hot dog and no hot peppers.

It also came with fries, the fries included were salty, crispy out the outside and didn&#39;t have a particularly flavorful potato paste on the inside. Overall, I&#39;ve had much better fries.

Based on my food on this experience I wasn&#39;t particularly fond of Stav&#39;s Kitchen. While I&#39;ve certainly had worse food, I wouldn&#39;t recommend the hot dog or fries here. Two stars."

A favorite place that whenever you go, the food is consistent and never disappoints. For a while, I was coming here so often that the gal behind the counter was already writing out my usual order before I even spoke: Greek salad with extra feta, an extra pita and medium diet coke. 

The salad is always fresh (even when I&#39;ve come in after 8pm at night). The Greek dressing is always served on the side--perfect since I don&#39;t like drowning my salads in dressing. I love their feta--soft and crumbly with great flavor. Their pita bread is fresh-baked, fluffy and warmed on the grill. 

My other go-to dish is the lemon rice soup. Great citrus lemon flavor and thick and creamy--perfect when I&#39;m feeling under the weather or just need a pick me up. Bright and yellow, its like a bowl of sunshine. 

The gyros is good--tender tasty meat. I don&#39;t care for the tzatziki sauce they serve with it--it might be that they use a different kind of Greek yogurt? Dunno, I like the gyros meat and when we&#39;re talking meat, it should be flavorful to stand alone, no?

Stav&#39;s has many reasonably healthy options and of course your fast food options when you crave them.

I&#39;ve tried a few dishes as has my husband.  The only reason I&#39;m giving 4 out of 5 stars is seasoning.  I think they need to amp up the salt (if they use any at all) in their chicken dishes.  Chicken alone can not carry itself so a bit of salt would help.  The ka bobs and the lemon rice soup were both needing some salt in my opinion.  Nothing I can&#39;t add myself but there is a difference in taste with grilling a properly salted piece of meat, and then adding it after the fact.

Things I&#39;ve tired......

Chicken Ka Bob Plate
Grilled chicken with pepper &amp; onion, rice pilaf, oven potatoes, and pita with tzatziki.  All good.  Love the tzatziki and who doesn&#39;t love a warm pita.  The rice pilaf is simple.  A heavy meal with all the carbs but at least not horrible for you.  A lot of food.

Chicken-Ka-Bob Sandwich
Much like the plate... chicken, peppers, onions with a side of tzatziki on a pita.  Got it with fries.  I LOVE THEIR FRIES AS DOES MY HUSBAND.  They are awesome.

Gyro Sandwich
My husband got this but of course I tried the meat.  Hard to mess up a gyro really but I do like a good browning of my meat after it&#39;s cut and they do that well.  Got it with teh heavenly fries.

Lemon Rice Soup
I only got this once as I was not impressed with it the time I had it.  Not much flavor and a bit watered down.  Could of been a bad batch.  Can&#39;t imagine they would not make this well.

Oven Roasted Potatoes
These are good.  My sister doesn&#39;t eat meat so got her an order of these and she liked them a lot.  Simple but taste homemade.

Me and my girlfriend went here for the first time the other day and were quite pleased.  I ordered the lemon rice soup and a gyro, and my girlfriend had the lemon rice soup and the chicken kabob plate.  The soup was pretty good, nothing to die for but better than a lot of others.  The gyro was good and just the right size.  Now I know it&#39;s nice to order a gyro and have enough meat for 2 people or bring some home, but for the price this sandwich was just right.  As for the chicken kabob plate, she seemed to enjoy it and it seemed quite plentiful.  As far as the staff goes, they were very friendly and went out of there way to make it an enjoyable dinner.

Overall I would definitely come back."

I started just getting gyros sandwiches and gyros plates, then I expanded to their chicken and salads.

Gyros are pretty damn good, and even good reheated when you can&#39;t finish all of it in one sitting!  That&#39;s a hard thing to accomplish as many times reheated gyros are chewy and basically inedible.  Now their chicken.. holy moly!  The meat falls off the bone.  The Grecian spices or their BBQ flavors are terrific, albeit once in a while the skin is a tidbit on the burnt side.

Now, the trumpets herald the excellent Greek salads they offer.  You can have a small or an ultimate salad... always crispy lettuce, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, crisp and slightly potent thin slices of onion, green pepper slice, dolmades (rice in a grape leaf), feta cheese, and kalamata olives, all can be covered in their spiced vinaigrette which is in a separate container so you can dose it out at your own convenience.  

Make sure that you phone ahead to place your order if you&#39;re going to the drive through window because this place is NOT fast food and you&#39;ll end up waiting if you just show up.

The restaurant area is always clean, and has a flat screen television, but I&#39;ve never dined-in."

I too am in love with the chicken leg special. It&#39;s unbeatable for 5$ that you can get that much (good) food. The chicken is tender and fall off the bone but they must finish it on the grill because it has some charcoal flavor. 

The greek salad too is amazing....very fresh, awesome dressing. The dolmades are interesting, I don&#39;t  think I&#39;ve ever had them on a greek salad before, but they are very tasty.

There&#39;s Dappers, I guess. There&#39;s every fast food place that lines Lake Street between IL-53 and Addison Road. Meh. And then there&#39;s Stav&#39;s!

Personally, I love the food at Stav&#39;s. Everything that I&#39;ve had there has been good, especially by takeout standards. The kabobs are great. The chicken is great. Fish is great (the salmon is just &#34;ok&#34;, but the tilapia is perfectly seasoned/grilled whenever I order it). The sides (soup, rice, potatoes, garlic bread) are always very good too.

I ran the 2010 Chicago Marathon and Stav&#39;s was my regular joint for carbo-loading. I&#39;d alternate between the grilled chicken breast plate (two grilled chicken breast fillets, potatoes, a shitload of rice and a slice of pita bread) and the grilled tilapia special (huge piece of grilled tilapia, shitload of rice and a giant piece of garlic bread). Both were in the $7-8 range. And both were perfect options for me to gobble up after a long day of working and training. The last thing I want to do on a weekday night after working 9-10 hours and running 5-10 miles is prepare a meal! Stav&#39;s was my answer.

The service is impeccable. It&#39;s family-owned and family-run, so you can tell that the people behind the counter (most of them, anyway) care about your food and experience. I regularly call my order in and then pick it up through the drive-thru window. Service with a smile...every single time. 

Gotta love this place. Five stars."

My previous experience with Stav&#39;s, I didn&#39;t actually go there, but my brother went out and got me a gyros salad, an interesting combination or something delicious with something boring, and the result was something amazing. But that was then. Spending a week in Addison looking after my sister&#39;s dog is a time for exploration. Why not check out the place I heard so much about? 

I spent a lot of time here in high school. It hadn&#39;t been around that long, you say? Well... I went there when it was Wendy&#39;s. And thank goodness Wendy&#39;s is gone. I went in and ordered a gyros combo, which comes with fries and a drink. While waiting I watched an inning of horrendous Cubs baseball on one of the television sets and trying to ignore some chick having a loud discussion on her cell phone. Right as one of the Cubs batters was thrown out trying to stretch a single into a double, my eyes met those of the guy working there and there was a feeling of mutual understanding. We both shook our heads, and thus began our discussion of how disappointing baseball has been for us. Nice guy, and it just illustrates the friendliness of the service.

The gyros was great. It was browned on the outside with minimal use of oil, so it didn&#39;t have that slippery consistency a lot of gyros sandwiches often have, and it wasn&#39;t drowning in tatziki sauce. I always found gyros sandiwches difficult to eat. Overstuffed. Everything falls out and you end up eating it with a fork, defeating the purpose of the pita. This one held together pretty well. I wasn&#39;t too crazy about the fries. It seems like almost every grease pit in the area uses the same fries. It gets redundant.

I think my gyros loyalties have changed, at least while I&#39;m in the burbs."

They mainly specialize in Greek-style food but they do have other options such as hot dogs, beef sandwiches and pastas. 

Dined here on a rainy Friday evening and the place wasn&#39;t too busy. They do offer a drive thru so I think most people choose that option. We ordered 2 chicken kabob dinners which both came with a side salad. Everything is cooked made to order so you can guarantee that your food will be fresh and hot. Like typical Greek places, you order, get your salad (or whatever side you choose) and sit down. They will call you when your main dish is ready. You eat on regular plates and use silverware, not plastic. The salad was really fresh but a very heavy hand was used with the oil/vinegar. I didn&#39;t mind but it wasn&#39;t necessarily healthy when it is drenched in dressing. Our chicken kabobs were really flavorful and came with rice pilaf, pita and potato wedges.

This location used to be a Wendy&#39;s years ago but Stav&#39;s have made some nice renovations to the inside for a cozier feel. They have a nice TV mounted on the wall which was playing Wheel of Fortune and Shark Tank (my fav). I believe the owners were working when we visited and you can tell they really care about their business. Will be back to try something else."

I am not going to say it&#39;s a HUB&#39;s  but at the same time, for us it gives you that authentic grease pit gyros feeling place.  The gyros passes the test.  I would like the cucumber sauce to be a bit   more thined down.  The portion size was average on the gyros.  I got a large fries and it was enough for a week so no complaints there.  The half chicken and potatoes passed the authentic test and so yes whenever we get the feeling for some fast food this place will be up there.  Oh one last thing.

The lemon rice soup they serve with their dinners is salty and delicious!  The owner is super friendly.

Honestly, if they had more people working, and a better system, this place would be a five star place. 

Now on to the food....I had the Pad Thai with shrimp, and it was seasoned well, and not spicy. The shrimp was cooked...I believe, there was one piece that seemed a little cold, but looked cooked. Since we both had lunch specials, we got a cup of their house soup, and a plate of crab rangoon . The soup was delicious and light, and the rangoon was crispy, but still light and not greasy. 
Overall, as I said earlier, if you want to wait three moon cycles to get a sip of water, then this is the place for you. Maybe try delivery or carry out for quicker service."

Thai House must have had a different location because the menus are old and beat up. The layout for a restaurant is pretty bad as 50% of the space is kitchen or an eyesore. 

The food is average at best from what I had. The spring rolls had dry and chewy fried tofu inside and a giant dried out green onion on top. The Tom Yum was ok but had zero heat to it, odd as it&#39;s supposed to be a spicy soup. The Pad Thai had the slightly wider noodles which I like but it was oversauced and sort of gummy, flavor was ok. Also tried the mixed seafood, a sweet but bland sauce. This was also supposed to be spicy and was not. 

Out of 4 items not one stood out as great, average at best (the Pad Thai). Everything seemed cooked properly but that only gets you so far. Portion size is also less than what I get at other places. I am not sure if I&#39;d go back to try other things (I know I should and probably will) which is too bad as it&#39;s the closest Thai spot to home...YMMV"

After an appetizer of spring rolls, I chose the Pa-Nang Curry with Chicken for my entree. I was worried that the curry would be too spicy for me but it was just right and delicious. It was served with white rice. My wife enjoyed her meal as well. It was a bit hard to communicate with the hostess because she didn&#39;t have a firm grasp on the english language yet but I won&#39;t let that keep me from going back."

The food is most certainly delicious. It&#39;s a cut above the other Thai options in the area. I will definitely be ordering again. I can only vouch for the two menu items I tried, but they were both great. Everything seemed very fresh. The delivery was speedier than expected too. (Thai delivery in Palatine. Who knew?)

They don&#39;t have a website out since they&#39;re new so I had to call. I wanted to place a to go order since that&#39;s faster for me. I wanted a lunch special tofu pad Thai easy on the tofu but the girl who was taking my order didn&#39;t seem to understand me very well but maybe it&#39;s because we were talking on the phone and not in person. I also asked how much it is and its $7.25 plus tax which includes your portion plus an appetizer. No one asked me which appetizer I would prefer so I guess I was hoping they would still put something in.

Upon arrival, the people working here seem to be very nice and the place looks cozy. But they do have an open floor kitchen which isn&#39;t the best thing for a casual Thai place but that&#39;s just my opinion. I came home and checked out my entree. I know it was a lunch portion but the pad Thai was tiny. Im not expecting too much but this was definitely smaller than I&#39;m used to and it didn&#39;t even fill up the container part. They did include two Thai egg rolls which were very tasty so that was at least nice of them. The pad Thai itself was delicious and I would definitely try them again if I&#39;m in the area but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to visit them again. They have nice people, and tasty food but the lunch to go portion was tiny in my opinion. 

I hope they do well and if you live by and maybe if you eat in you will have a better experience."

We had to request condiments and the jasmine tea that my son ordered never came although we were billed for it along with a Coke that we never ordered was also billed. The food was nothing great but just OK. We eat at a lot of restaurants and are definitely supportive of our local neighborhood restaurants. I want them to thrive. This attracts people and trade.

I ordered the lunch portion of Thai Cashew Chicken, preceeded by a spring roll. I was served a small portion of noodle soup that tasted like canned chicken broth. No flavor at all. The spring roll was also completely void of flavor. Tasteless.  When the entree showed up I was hoping for something with flavor.
What I got was the saltiest chicken dish I&#39;ve ever eaten in ANY Asian restaurant. It was so over salted it was inedible PLUS the rice was cold.  The waitress told me they could make another, but what I had tasted left me with no appetite. They had the nerve to charge for a terrible, uneaten meal.

I finally get over the bad service, low food quality and less portion and request my check.

Because I&#39;ve been about 7 x already.  Thanks to this delicious affordable Thai place near my house-- I make less dinner.  

Price: very affordable.  People who complain probably only eat Fast Food.  Cheaper than Siri.

Diet:
My boyfriend and I are vegan/vegetarian glutenfree.

Food:
Excellent.
Moving to palatine from being spoiled by the many amazing diverse ethnic restaurants in Skokie/Evanston before, has been hard.  The food here has delicious and original and addicting flavors I&#39;ve never tasted.  I&#39;ve had Thai food all across the country, and this place is an authentic gem-- that is distinguished.

Vegetarian bonus points:
They make their food from scratch not prepackaged like the other places, and don&#39;t lie about fish sauce, like the other Siri Thai places in town.  They&#39;re willing and happy to cater to your needs and requests--not many places do the way they do.  Their food is authentic and flavorful--just how it would taste in Thailand.  

Favorites meals:
Panang, Pad Thai, crispy noodles!  I honestly couldn&#39;t have pad Thai at other places because of their use of eggs, but these guys make it delicious with a flavor I&#39;ve never tasted before.  Crispy noodles are just as good as Thai Garden in Schaumburg.

Extremely thoughtful:
They are the only Thai Restaurant that uses special cookware and serve with separate utensils and dishware for vegetarians.  

About the owner:
They&#39;re a small business owner family, that&#39;s there every single day, with smiles on their faces that greet everyone genuinely.  Ask the owner his story.  And he&#39;s open for suggestions on improving.

Patience: 
Have some, they&#39;re new and figuring things out and becoming more coordinated each time! They&#39;re a little understaffed but awesome.  

Ambiance:
My boyfriend and I love it.  There is a cheery vibe, and the fireplace in the cold is awesome!!!!!"

The food was mostly bland.  Do not know if it was an off night as others seem to rave about this place.  Panda Express has more flavor - I expect depth and complexity from good Thai food.

Portions were meh - suppose that was a good thing as nothing really demanded to be saved for lunch tomorrow.  For sure not a value buy.  3 pieces of overcooked shrimp in a dish we paid over $12 for - come on.  Spicy beef looked/seemed boiled (looked very pale) - not stir fried and there was ZERO spice to the SPICY beef!

Overall, we don&#39;t go for the ambiance, but we go because it&#39;s the best Thai food around!"

Ordered it to go and only took about 10 minutes to get my food. I thought it was really good! I had the chicken pad thai and they gave me a container of the thai chili sauce so I could make it my own heat level.  I thought the portion was OK for lunch.  But for dinner, it probably could be bigger than it was.  I also ordered the Golden Triangle appetizer.  The filling was tasty from what I could tell, but there was so little of it in the wanton it was hard to really say for sure!  So, food was good, but 4 stars for portions and I felt pretty ripped off by the app, actually.  Plus, there was NO air conditioning - it was absolutely sweltering in there; I don&#39;t see how anyone could dine in."

Excellent Thai food! I had it delivered through Grub Hub (wish they delivered on their own) and was very pleased!! Very fast delivery! My only issue is that I paid and tipped ahead of time and   asked to have the food left on my porch because I have two very loud dogs that are difficult to calm down and he not only rang my doorbell, he also went around back to my sliding glass door and knocked on that door before I even had a chance to answer my front door! Excellent shrimp yellow curry and shumai. Generous portion sizes! The yellow curry was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had, and that is what I ALWAYS order for Thai food so I&#39;ve had it tons of places. I also had the Rama noodle, but probably wouldn&#39;t order it again. It wasn&#39;t bad at all, just a bit rich and creamy for my specific taste and I would like to try their other noodle dishes. If you like a creamy and peanuty (not a word lol) sauce, you&#39;d probably love this. I had it with chicken, and it also has big broccoli florets. I thought the prices were very reasonable and on point with other Thai places. Very happy they are open and love having a local Thai place!! Definitely would recommend to anyone! Excited to try other dishes from them and I will definitely be ordering regularly and hope to dine in soon. Yum!"

Didn&#39;t realize how new it was.  The decor needs some work, but the food was just fantastic.  It may be the best Thai food I&#39;ve had, certainly the best in the suburbs.  My daughter had Pad Thai and I had Panang Curry.  Both had lots of good complex flavor - I never order Pad Thai because it tends to taste sugary - this did not.  The Crab Rangoon and Spring Rolls were also great.  And the prices on the lunch special were perfect :)  I can&#39;t wait to go back!"

If you can&#39;t decide then get those. They also have good hotdogs and gyros. In fact most of the food here is good. 
My only issue is that the wait times for food can get a bit lengthy. Probably due to being short staffed. Especially during the week. Thankfully though it doesn&#39;t get too busy unless it&#39;s the weekend. Weekends can be a bit faster. 

If you are in Bartlett or nearby I recommend this place for anything hotdog, burger or beef related. Yum! Just be prepared to wait a bit."

My chicken gyro: It had a generous amount of chicken, it was flavorful and juicy. The tzatiki sauce completed it perfectly. There was lettuce and tomato on it too.

The Fries: were hot and salted, nothing out of the normal. typical wavy fries 

The hotdog: I took a bite out of my boyfriends hotdog. It came chicago style with onions, mustard, tomato and relish. The bun was soft and had poppy seeds on it. Overall it was a good dog, Id order it next time."

Just picked up 2 Dogs with everything, These were the two skimpiest hot dogs I have ever purchased from here. On both dogs 1 thin slice of tomato, 1 sport pepper and barely any onion or relish. I know its only a hot dog but if that&#39;s what you are selling make the effort.

Ordered the garlic cheesy beef. Didn&#39;t notice any garlic at all, and beef didn&#39;t have any kick to it.

My husband and I have lived in Bartlett for four years now and finally decided to stop by for some food. 

He ordered the hot dogs and a tamale, while I got a burger no bun and fries.  I was a little disappointed by the tamale as it was one I could buy at jewel. We were very happy with everything else though. 

The best part, it was a Tuesday, so the hot dogs were one dollar.  Thus, making our bill with tax, 10 dollars.  

Win in my book!"

- hot dog prices VERY fair (Tuesday&#39;s .99 all day. M-F .99 between 2-4 pm), especially compared to Portillo&#39;s ($2.85 before tax) and Scooby&#39;s ($2.99 before tax. If you want peppers that&#39;s .60 extra before tax).  Note:  Hotdogs are almost identical to Scooby&#39;s.

- Fries are good and you get a TON.  However, they can be a little salty.  Note to restaurant:  Just add a pinch or two less of salt.

- Italian beefs - potential is there, but like many have said - served on the wrong bun. I even professionally asked the owner this on his fb page, and he replied in a friendly way stating that they chose to use &#34;rolls&#34; instead of Turano bread for their own reasons, most being a freshness factor.  I believe the rolls they use are homemade and made right at the restaurant.  The beef IS GOOD, but I don&#39;t like the soft hoagie-type doughy rolls.  I simply think they should be using Gonella or Turano french bread.

We will return."

The $.99 hot dogs were really good, the fries were crunchy and salted just right, and like others have said, there were enough in the large bag for three people. We decided to get a hot dog each and split a large garlic cheesy beef. Now, let me just say that Johnnie&#39;s beef will always be #1 in my book. Buona is a close second. But the Dogfather&#39;s beef is INCREDIBLE! From the first juicy, cheesy, spicy bite, we were instantly hooked! The bread is so fresh and flavorful (it said said that they make it there), the beef is not too dry and the mixture of the spices along with the melted cheese is just right. We will definitely go back there, and we&#39;ll be looking forward to it."

I must say, it was no Portillos (I don&#39;t know what kind of crack Portillos puts in their food to make it the greatest food EVER but no one can beat it.  NO ONE) but it was a close second.  

We got some hotdogs and a cheesy garlic beef with some fries.  The hotdogs were pretty darn close to a Portillos perfect Chicago Red Hot.  I could go here for hotdogs any day and not actually miss Portillos at all.  The large fries we got were crispy crinkled and delicious and were honestly big enough for 2-3 people to share. (P.S. No one needs that amount of fries.  That said, I ate half the bag myself...for shame.)  The beef was great too with its crispy garlicky spicy yumminess at the top and gooey au jusy goodness at the bottom BUT I definitely prefer the dipped gooey bread and fall apart beef (doused in hot giardiniera) that Portillos offers.  I guess it&#39;s a matter of preference really.  If you want your beef to be more like the old Garibaldi&#39;s with its crispier baked bread and its tougher but more flavorful beef, come here.  If you want your sandwich to be a drippy gooey fall apart mess that melts in your mouth, go to Portillos.  Honestly, I wish that I could have the best of both worlds and have Portillos make my beef on their garlic bread and call it a day because I do like the garlicky touch that the Dogfather puts on their beef.  

Overall, this place was excellent if you live in Bartlett, like a nice cheap meal, and don&#39;t compare it to Portillos."

So far have visited multiple times since we moved to Bartlett.  Is your standard selection of food...hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken etc.  Everything that I have had is delicious.  Why am I giving it 4 stars and not 5?  Tater tots.  They have them-and they are awesome...but they only give you a couple.  If you order the fries (which are also good, if a bit salty) you get enough to feed a small army.  The TT you get enough to feed an infant child.  What&#39;s the deal between the two?

We popped in for a quick bite and to meet up with a friend. I went with the Garlic Cheezy Beef, which is an Italian beef on garlic bread, and it was pretty good. I wish it wouldn&#39;t get wrapped up in foil if you&#39;re dining in because the bread became soggy, as did the Tater Tots, while waiting for my friend&#39;s order. Still, the sandwich had good flavor and my fiancé says their Combo Beef-n-Sausage is better than Portillo&#39;s version.

We showed up on a Saturday right when they opened, so it was a bit chilly inside. Hopefully it warms up in the winter as they get things cookin&#39;.

The tables weren&#39;t very clean, so I ended up wiping one off with napkins before we sat down. It would have been too tight a squeeze for five in a booth but they have stand alone chairs available and a counter with stools."

I finally did on Memorial Day (hey, lots of places were open!) but sadly they weren&#39;t. So today while sort-of in the area, I decided to stop by. 

I walked inside and noticed every table was taken (probably a good sign), so I placed my everything Chicago Style Hot Dog and small fries to go. I wasn&#39;t acknowledged as I browsed the menu, and I felt as though the cashier subconsciously was trying to rush me to order. This nameless cashier clearly had better places to be. Besides the scowl she wore and the look of boredom on her face, my entire interaction with her consisted of a conversation one might have with a child. 
 
&#34;What would you like?&#34; &#34;A Chicago Style dog with everything, small fries, and a small drink, please.&#34;  
*Writes my order on the bag; &#34;name?&#34;  
&#34;Heidi&#34; 
*types in order on iPad.* &#34;$3.91&#34; 
*hands over money*
&#34;It&#39;ll be ready in a few minutes. *hands me my cup for my drink*&#34;

So I get my drink, and less than five minutes later, the girl calls my name, puts the bag next to the drink machine, and that was it. No &#34;Thank you, have a nice day&#34; or anything along those lines. Nada, zip, zilch.  As a first time visitor, I was put off by her attitude. Maybe I caught her on a bad day, but regardless I felt like a burden and not a valued customer. I grabbed my order and made my way out to the car, not looking back.

The fries were crinkle cut, piping hot, and perfectly salted.  The hot dog came on a poppy seed bun, a good sized pickle spear, two thinly sliced tomato wedges, onions, mustard, celery salt, relish, and sport pepper. All ingredients accounted for. I was disappointed that there was only one sport pepper and the celery salt was applied to the pickle and not the hot dog itself (I usually take the pickle and eat it separately from the dog). The hot dog was good, but nothing spectacular. 

Their menu consists of the typical items you&#39;d find at other hot dog joins; burgers, Italian beefs, Gyros, Maxwell Street Polish, pizza puffs, mozzarella sticks, etc.  The prices for their items are fair, if not cheaper than you&#39;d expect. They do have a menu for kids called &#34;Little Pup meals&#34; which includes the item of choice with a drink and tater tots. 

The restaurant was clean, despite all the people dining in. The only exception would be the extremely sticky floor by the pop machine, although that&#39;s a given at nearly every establishment. It was also rather warm inside, so I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t stick around to eat.

Overall, the food is okay and the prices are reasonable, so it&#39;s worth stopping at if you&#39;re in the area, but don&#39;t make it your destination, as other reviewers have said."

They use rolls that immediately turn to mush instead of French rolls.  I don&#39;t understand this decision.  It renders what could be a good sandwich an inedible mess.  Strange.

The staff was furiously trying to clean tables and counters; I&#39;m guessing  large group had just left. Coming straight from the driving range, I headed into the bathroom and it was moderately clean. The floors were a little wet, there were some towels on the floor. I guess one of them should have checked the bathroom too. 

I stood alone at the counter for a good two minutes before someone stopped cleaning and helped me out. I guess I admire their dedication. Anyway, I ordered two dogs and a drink. I went with lemonade as I never drink Pepsi products. The dogs was of good quality, as it was steamed well and the roll was warm. There was a good ratio of toppings as none of them overpowered any of the others, which sometimes happens. Two complaints: the dogs are steamed and I prefer grilled. Also, there was only one piece of tomato. Maybe that&#39;s for budget reasons, but dog gone it, I want my tomato all the way through my hot dog! I would consider returning as it was an ok experience. Not bad, not great. Just good."

Ownership was on their game choosing a location, the only hot dog joint around. Also a brilliant marketing tactic selling .99 cent dogs on Tuesdays and between 2 and 4 weekdays. Sell average food by &#34;Volume&#34; and they will come!

I am a living testimonial, a repeat customer for over 5 years. If I happen to be in the area, it crosses my mind. This is strictly a convenience stop and definitely not a destination. I do not wake up in the morning, jump out of bed, scratch, open the curtains to view a perfectly cloudy morning and proclaim &#34;This is a Dogfather kinda day&#34; Nope.

Now for the details. Granted this is a &#34;Nit-Pic&#39;, but one of substance. The Dogfather considers itself an upper echelon Dog Joint. Such a place would be consistent with prep and detail of food and not focus on the Black and White pictures on the wall and the paint color behind them.

Serious Hot Dog Joints know this, thus the focus on detail: Upon ordering a Chicago Style Hot Dog, I may ask &#34;What brand of dog do you serve&#34;? I&#39;ve received answers that run the gamut. The best is the &#34;deer in headlights&#34; cashier interaction &#34;don&#39;t know&#34;.

I have been eating Chicago Style Dogs enough to know that hot dog reviews on Yelp are over the top, or just plain boring. This is my best rendition:

&#34;The poppy seed bun is steamed properly however the Vienna Beef or Red Hot Chicago Dog was placed a tad off center in retrospect! Ouch! Quite possibly a result of yellow mustard drenching the northern portion of the bun exclusively.  The vegetable garden presentation raised an eye brow. The sweet onions where chopped small allowing the scant relish population to remain competitive. Such a battle. The two tomato slices were thin and a bit withered. I actually felt some compassion. The thick pickle spear complemented the single over sized sport pepper, an unwanted comparison&#34;. Yes, a compelling read.

Lets talk about the Beef Sandwich. Good thing, they offer the option of serving on garlic bread. Bad thing, served on a thick bun tasting like dough. Your first bite of a classic Chicago Beef  should taste &#34;Pure Beef&#34;, not bread!

Bottom Line, It&#39;s tough to be a little dog."

I absolutely hate crying and try to avoid it at all costs, but the tears poured when I saw the finale. Oh, Al Pacino.. http://vimeo.com/62591294

So it was fated that I would try this place out just based on its name.

10&#34; garlic cheesy bread ($6.95) - 4.25 stars. 4 stars for taste, 5 for value. Colossus of a beef sandwich. Way better value than Portillo&#39;s, free sweet &amp; hot peppers if desired (which I always do haha). Bread that stands up to the weight and breadth of all that meat. The meat wasn&#39;t as juicy/tender as I remembered when I tried it last (June 2013).

Chicago-style hotdog ($1.99, or $0.99 on Tuesdays) - 4.5 stars, 5 stars on Tuesdays haha. Very good, but not the best hotdog I&#39;ve had or among my top favorites. I&#39;m more into dogs with a snap and/or char. Other than that, pretty darn perfect for a Chicago-style hotdog. Soft bun &amp; well-proportioned toppings.

Overall, an affordable neighborhood fast food joint good for if you&#39;re in the area."

Simple, affordable, clean, fast, tasty , and to the point. This is a no frills fast food place with a funny owner and fast as hell service. 

I drove by this place noticing something peculiar: The quiznos and chinese restaurants next to it we really empty and this place had a line and a crowd packed inside. This was obviously a good sign so I stopped in for a bite. 

Standard portillos style fast food joint: Beef, hot dogs, fries...etc. 

Prices were great and the place was clean. 

I got the: 

Garlic Cheesy Beef sandwich 6 inch (6 bucks): COMPLETELY worth the price. This thing weighs in at like 2 pounds!  Its basically an Italian beef sandwich (dripping wet with au jus), with cheese. I got sweet and hot peppers (WHICH WERE FREE BTW!) and it came 4 minutes later. The cheese was totally melted with chunks of sweet peppers in it. Hot peppers were on the side which I like. Though I couldn&#39;t taste any garlic this sandwich kicked ass nonetheless. 

Fries: Skinny crinkle cut fries. If you like portillo&#39;s fries these are basically those but skinnier and thinner. Really crunchy though. 

Drink: Fountain drinks..nuff said. 

Overall I&#39;m definitely going to be a regular here. They have daily specials which are unbeatable like 99 cent hot dogs on Tuesdays!

If you want a fast, high quality, affordable bite this is your place!"

The positive - 
1.  the owner is awesome and friendly, always remembers my boys and I when we come in;
2.  My boys like the gyros and they have lots of meat on them;
3.  Prices don&#39;t suck, too bad.

The negative - 
1.  The entire place needs to be scrubbed with a Mr. clean wall eraser.  The tables are sticky and dingy, there are visible dark marks from hands on the white restroom doors... So what does the kitchen look like?
2.  The cheese sticks, what the heck?  No sir, we don&#39;t like &#39;em!  
3.  The fries are REALLY average.  No taste unless they&#39;re buried in salt;
4.  Nothing special about the hot dogs, I make much better at home... Not worth it, even at 99 cents"

My son can&#39;t get enough of the mozzarella sticks.  They aren&#39;t &#34;normal&#34; sticks.  They are sooooo much better.  It&#39;s a flour tortilla rolled up with cheese inside and deep fried.  He doesn&#39;t even bother with the marinara sauce.  (Don&#39;t worry, it doesn&#39;t go to waste around here.)

The gyros are at the top of my hubby&#39;s Must Have List.  He rarely finishes the sandwich because it is so large.  He also likes to nibble on the french fries.  Nothing extraordinary - BUT, they are fried correctly.  They aren&#39;t overly greasy or overly salted.  They are crisp and just right.

Finally, my favs...  The Italian sausage and beef combo sandwich is delicious.  The sausage is seasoned really well.  I thought it was possible that they make their own sausage, but my husband insists that I am wrong.  Honestly, I can&#39;t bring myself to ask.  It&#39;s good.  That&#39;s all that I know for sure.  The onion rings are beer battered, not breaded with that crumbly, crunchy stuff.  Those are mighty fine, too.  Finally, I am a fan of their burger.  I like it cooked a bit on the well side with crispy bacon.  It&#39;s a good size and I usually don&#39;t finish it.

We visited at approximately 1:00 PM.  There was a bored-looking girl at the counter who barely acknowledged our presence when we arrived at the counter to place our order.  We gave her our order, which she wrote on a paper bag. She rung up our order and when we paid via debit card, she did not provide a receipt, say thank you or anything else.  She just picked her pen up again and looked at the person behind us.  

We decided to eat in the restaurant, which was a mistake.  All of the tables were dirty and there was a general mess on the floor in front of the beverage machine.  It did not appear that it was in anyone&#39;s job description to keep the dining area clean.  I was afraid that I was going to slip in the spilled soda in front of the beverage machine.  

The straw that broke the camel&#39;s back was the women&#39;s restroom.  The soap dispenser was broken. To me, this was a red flag as far as the cleanliness of the restaurant as I began to worry that the staff may not be washing their hands.

The final issue was that the bored-looking girl at the counter was also texting on her phone as we left.

I&#39;ve had a cheesy garlic beef sandwich, their fries, and their gyros here. It is very easy to go wrong with any of those things. The fries could be greasy and floppy. The beef sandwich could be flavorless, or sopping wet. The gyros could be dry and forgettable.

But none of those things apply here. The fries are always hot and crisp. The cheesy garlic beef was flavorful and meaty. And the gyros the last time around were moist. Plus, they always get my order right.

At some point I&#39;m gonna try their dogs, since it&#39;s in their name. But I&#39;m more than willing to rate them highly based on what I&#39;ve already had. As far as I know, it&#39;s the best fast food joint in Bartlett."

The restaurant was incredibly clean, even after an entire day of business. The owner/manager was also present, and he was chatting with his employees and the customers. I could tell that everyone working there enjoyed his company, and he appeared to genuinely care about his employees- even lending a hand during the closing. We each had the gyro, which was delicious and tons of food- didn&#39;t even need to sample the fries because I was full. We&#39;ve been by here on other days- and when there is nice weather the line is out the door. Seating is limited, but it is definitely a location we will try again in the future."

 The only thing about the place I didn&#39;t like was the system they use to give you your food. They ask your name and write it on the bag. Then they call your name when your food is up.well there happened to be someone else there with the same name causing major confusion , and the girl behind the counter needs to learn her job better. After waiting for twenty minutes, I asked where my food was and she said it is place here in the pick up area on the bottom .

They have a fairly wide menu of available menu items, but being the hot dog critic I ordered a hot dog. 

The hot dog I received came on a nice soft poppy seed bun, it had a noticable amount of celery salt, well applied relish and mustard, sport peppers, and two little tomato slices. The pickle was sliced thinly though was still a bit more sour than I like. Everything was applied well, it was a little light on onions but they were definitely present and their flavor shined through. The dog itself had a nice flavor to it, it was well cooked with all the flavor intact. This was a textbook example of how to make a Chicago style hot dog well.  Everything had a great flavor and I have no real complaints about the hot dog, only noticing slightly less than usual onions, a little more celery salt than most places, and a long and thinly cut pickle.

I also tried the tater tots, the tots I received were nice and crisp with a good flavor. I didn&#39;t grab a menu but my total for two hot dogs, tots and a drink was around $6.50. Considering the price this place earns five stars. This is also the best example I&#39;ve found of Red Hot Chicago branded hot dog served by a restaurant."

Even though they do have a brisk lunch business I never felt rushed. The staff is cheerful and the service is quick. Our food was ready lickity-split and our fries and Chicago-style dogs were piping hot. 

Their menu is small but they are a hot dog place so it&#39;s to be expected. They have a specialty and don&#39;t venture far. I like how you can get a small side salad instead of fries. A nice option if you don&#39;t plan in wolfing your meal down in your car. And any place which has Diet Mt. Dew as a beverage choice gets extra points by me. Oh, and they have free refills."

It was a pretty solid meal.  I would say it&#39;s comparable to Nana&#39;s and Portillo&#39;s.  We ordered our food to go.  I got a chili dog and onion rings and a side salad, and my husband got a chicago dog and fries.  Our total came to $13.

My husband said his Chicago dog was good (just like Portillos) and the fries were just ok.  He wasn&#39;t expecting crinkle-cut fries, I think.  

My chili dog was solid--I liked the chili they used on it--flavorful without being psicy, just how I like it.  The actual hot dog seemed very small, though.  It did have a good snap when you bit into it, though.  The dressing used for the side salad was really good, and the salad was decent sized as well.  Now for the onion rings.  They had a good flavor, but they didn&#39;t have that crunch I usually like in my rings.  Also, when I bit into the first one, hot oil came out and absolutely scalded my tongue.  I&#39;m not even exaggerating--it&#39;s RAW today.  It hurt SO badly last night, too.  So boo for that!

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try their chicken gyros, though!  There were also some other things on the menu I would be interested in!  It was really hopping in there, too--lots of little leaguers who must have just gotten done with their games.

But I do hope this place stays around for a while.  It was pretty solid."

We got there around 530pm and the trays of food seemed to be dry on top as if they haven&#39;t had any customers in a few hours. We ended up with just egg rolls and Adobo. The Adobo was pretty standard fare. If you&#39;re filipino and your Adobo isn&#39;t good,  you were probably adopted. The egg rolls on the other hand were pretty nasty tasting. It had a very distinct sour, celery and pepper taste to it. Probably the worst filipino egg rolls I&#39;ve ever had. The entree and egg rolls were both small order but the total ended up being around $15 which I think is a huge ripoff. The Adobo didn&#39;t even come with rice. 

Service: we walked in and didn&#39;t even get a hello. The lady behind the counter had this stare as if we were life long enemies. Her brows were angled like she was ready to send out a small army after us. When asked about the prices she replied abruptly pointing at this small sign covered by other paper. When we were done ordering she handed the food to the cashier who didn&#39;t know how much things cost because he had to ask the lady about the price. He probably didn&#39;t see the sign either. When getting our change he didn&#39;t have enough coins so he decided to not give it to us. We said something and he went into other registers to scavenge the rest of our change. He gave us some more coins and said &#34;can you see if that&#39;s enough&#34;? It wasn&#39;t. But we had enough of this place and left with our food and being short  changed.

The way they make Dinuguan, Menudo, Fried Lumpia, Rice, Barbecue Pork, and Pancit are all perfect.  It&#39;s not just a place to get cooked food, but this is also a Filipino Market that sells ingredients.  This is the place I come to when I have a craving for the food I grew up on.

Customer service is very important and it&#39;s what will help keep customers coming back.  When I visited to order food two times recently, the cashier or the person who attended seemed annoyed and she made me feel unwelcome.  Although, luckily they have this old lady who I think is the cook and is super sweet and seemed very attentive.  Because of this little old lady, she made the place that seemed cold, warm.

This is another place where I will have to suggest:
*  if you want to try awesome Filipino food in this area and don&#39;t care whether the person serving your food looks annoyed or doesn&#39;t seem to care whether you are there or not, this is the place to go.
*  if you know what to order and are very quick about it so that you don&#39;t annoy the cashier, all because the food here is great, this is the place to go.
*  if you are okay with come in and out, no smile, no fuss kind of service, but want to eat the best Filipino food, definitely come here.

Overall, the food is great but the customer service just needs a lot of work.  My rating is 1 star for customer service and 4 stars for the food."

I used to live in San Diego where there was Filipino food galore &amp; one of my dear friends out there is a Filipina so I have been spoiled in the past with some amazing food.  

This is a small restaurant with some Filipino grocery items as well.  It seems like they do a brisk take-out &amp; catering business.  The buffet was on the small-side with 15 items plus rice &amp; soup, but for such a small restaurant I wouldn&#39;t expect much more.  Everything we tried was quite good - but I couldn&#39;t tell you what we tried aside from lumpia &amp; pancit as I&#39;ve never learned the names of any of the other dishes &amp; there wasn&#39;t any signs indicating what was what (which might be a good idea just from a food allergy perspective for them to add).  My favorite items were what I would pot roast in a slightly spicy sauce with bell peppers &amp; potatoes and then this amazing chicken dish that was in a coconut-milk broth with potatoes, bell peppers &amp; carrots - wow, the coconut broth really made this dish so very delicious.  I also really enjoyed the tapioca-custard type of dish that had an interesting fruity note to it &amp; had cooked carrots in it.  For deserts in addition to the tapioca there was also mashed sweetened purple yam (yum!) &amp; some sort of salad that was a cross between a pasta salad &amp; a fruit salad that was mayo-based.

We had no idea what to do when we first arrived as all the employees were either in the kitchen or quickly shuttling dishes to &amp; fro from the buffet.  We kind of stood around for a minute, then sat at a table for another when I noticed an older couple talking &amp; the wife gesturing towards us.  Finally my husband walked up to the register area &amp; the husband of that older couple came up to tell him we can go ahead &amp; eat &amp; then come up to pay afterwards.  Glad they took pity on the only non-Asians in the place because the staff was too busy to notice."

The taste was pretty good. There was some rice, noodle, meat, and seafood dishes. There was some salad and dessert too.

Since it was a buffet, I won&#39;t comment on the service but a worker asked us about the food and said everything was made on site from scratch.

Price was $10.99 which I thought was kind of pricey for lunchtime but not over the top expensive since it was all you can eat.

The other half of the dining area is a store for Filipino groceries.

Vultures wouldn&#39;t even fly over the Lechon (Pig) since basically there were only bones left, and yes, the Lechon was cold. The Caldereta was decent but cold.

I came in at 5pm and bought some food to take home. I ordered rice and they said they did not have it coz it was already late but they don&#39;t close til 7 pm. I asked for sauce for the egg rolls and the lady gave me an attitude about it coz they did not have it either. What&#39;s the point of having a restaurant not having the most basic items for their customers? And their attitude towards me did not help at all, it&#39;s as if they couldn&#39;t be bothered one bit. Am never going back to this place again.
You walk in there all hungry only to find out you have to go to another restaurant to get your rice. Rice being the staple food of Filipinos."

There are other reviews here that mention a lady with attitude and that is exactly the main problem.  The staff is really rude and not friendly at all.  I don&#39;t know how they stay in business if they treat their customers with attitude.  We tried the Sunday buffet lunch.  Which is pricey for the type of food they serve.  As soon as we walked in though, we were just ignored.  We sat ourselves and the staff just sat around looking at us.  I had to go to the cash register and ask how we are supposed to get our lunch.  That&#39;s when the attitude elevated.  She sneered at me and punched something in the register and said it was going to be $22 for lunch and then asked me if I wanted drinks.  I said yes and she came back with $24.  I said OK and I paid.  I asked if she would bring the drinks to our table.  She rudely said yes and went to the back to do something.  She didn&#39;t even tell me what was available at the buffet or give any type of direction.  We had to figure things out on our own.  The food at the buffet was OK, which is why I gave it one star.  If I could give it zero, I would.  The presentation was terrible and there was food customers dropped between all the trays and mixed into the other trays.  The floors had food and looked like nobody swept them all day.  The restaurant is also over crowded with tables, so you have very little room to walk around when going to the buffet.  Only half of the tables were occupied when we were there and people were bumping into each other and the tables all the time.  Remember when the lady said she would bring drinks to the table, she never did.  I waited ten minutes for the drinks to be brought to our table and I finally went up to a staff member who was restocking the silverware and asked about our drinks.  He ran to the back and asked someone about it.  I was told to go to the refrigerator in the back and get the drinks myself.  What???  Why didn&#39;t the lady who charged me just tell me that in the first place?  Instead of BS&#39;ing me about bringing the drinks to the table and walking away, she should of just told me to go get my drinks and I wouldn&#39;t have gotten so mad.  Anyway, after that ordeal, the staff basically ignored us the rest of the time we were there.  I only had one plate of food and my wife, who is Filipina, had two.  She didn&#39;t really want to get another plate, but she was hungry.  After eating, she said the food is not worth the price we paid for it.  Obviously, we are never coming back.  I&#39;m not sure how long this place has been around, but I don&#39;t see it being around much longer if they continue to treat customers with subpar food, an unclean restaurant, and unfriendly staff."

My family orders from here ALL the time!  Good selection and good home coming.  We&#39;ve used them for everyday meals and catering events.  Every time, I&#39;ve gotten attentive and helpful service and awesome food. 

Their weekend buffet has a lot their typical menu items that are featured during the week but its quality and the value is fair for the number of choices.  I would say there are about 3 tables of food and probably only 10 tables to sit at.  So, try to get there early.

Besides their take-out foods, buffet and catering service, they also have a small food pantry store stocked with soup mixes, snacks, and common Filipino cooking essentials. 

Overall, I think  it&#39;s a good &#34;ma and pa&#34; place to support.  So, if you&#39;re in the area and looking for Filipino food, you should stop by!  Sarap!"

The food is never hot at this place and to be honest compared to other Filipino restaurants their food is below average. The calderetta is bland and the lumpia shanghai is not freshly prepared. The people who work here are not friendly at all especially (the female and male cashier). 

Couple of days ago I spent $6.95 for 20 pieces of lumpia because the unfriendly lady told me it is cheaper for me to buy 20 pieces than to buy 10 pieces ( for 40 cents each  even though it was 20 minutes before store closing).  I came home and even my 3 year old son wouldn&#39;t take a 2nd bite.  The lumpia shanghai was not only old but completely dried out from sitting under the heat lamp for several hours.  I don&#39;t trust this place for quality food and the service is very bad. They make you feel like you should be thanking them for giving them business. No thank you."

I have to say that while the food is pretty awesome, its still not as good my mother&#39;s cooking. For me, I feel that this is the suburban equivalent to Ruby&#39;s Fast Food. It&#39;s much larger though and you can fit a ton of people in there.

Dessert&#39;s good too...whatever that was that was made out of ube, it was delish.

So, every once in a while we have to &#34;try&#34; one of these Filipino restaurants in Chicago area. This time we took my 2 older kids from my previous marriage. I think my kids and I were the first white people to ever come in here, as we were noticed the second we walked in. Then, everyone that came in the door after us all had the same, &#34;Hey, who left the lights on?!&#34; expression on their faces.

We had to wait a few minutes for 2 tables to come available, as there were 5 of us. They had 2 tables pushed together and were cleaning them when a Filipino couple decided to sit at one of them, causing us to wait another minute or 2...but not long. For shame on some of the Filipinos in the Chicago area, for losing their hospitality and manners...which I have read runs deep in the Filipino culture. I SAID &#34;READ&#34; NOT &#34;WITNESSED&#34;!!!

A lot of other reviews stated this place fills up fast, this is true for a reason. It&#39;s small. Really small, only 12 tables. So, there isn&#39;t really much room the breath in here let alone move to the buffet.

I led my 12 year old daughter to the buffet as I have been to enough &#34;pot luck&#34; meals and &#34;Fil-AM&#34; parties to know what is what...or so I thought. NOTHING was labeled. So, my daughter stuck with egg rolls. She asked me&#34;Why are their egg rolls here? Where is the lumpia?&#34; hmmmm...good question.

To make a long story short, there wasn&#39;t much to choose from. And, what I did eat was of medium flavor and quality. The food did not remotely come close to my asawas cooking.
She was not impressed either. But, don&#39;t worry. We have decided that when we win the lottery, we are going to open our own Filipino restaurant.( Manners and appropriate attire are a must! ;0)"

One of our favorite things to do is make lumpia for the holidays and for a potluck I wanted to share that tradition with my family.  However, I knew I simply didn&#39;t have the time to get the lumpia from my home in Oak Forest to my work in Bloomingdale hot and delicious.  I knew Manila Fiesta existed so I called them up *literally* the day before gave them my order and they had no problem having the food ready the next day.  When I picked up my order (one tray of traditional lumpia, and 10 shanghai) I noticed the ladies in the back preparing and cooking the food.  There is a good feeling knowing that everything is made fresh.  I also discovered their hot bar and couldn&#39;t resist the pancit as well as a few personal favorites from their extensive grocery section. 

The gentleman ringing me up didn&#39;t believe I was Filipino so I shared my family history with him and came to find out that he was born in the same place as my Mom.  We conversed a little and I was invited me to come back again to try other items from the hot bar.  My coworkers are a tough crowd when it comes to food and even they were very impressed.  The size of the shanghai lumpia was as close as you could get to what my lumpia look like when I cook them with my family.  It made me laugh because my cousin is always arguing with me that I wrap my lumpia too large, but after visiting Manila Fiesta I know that they are just the right size.  There was a great deal of traffic from locals so it did take a while to get rung up, but it was so worth it."

I had a $25 certificate from Restaurant.com, I thought I should give it a try.

First of all this is NOT a restaurant.

Manila Fiesta is a grocery store where customers can order food from the small deli section.  There are a few tables where people can sit.  
Back to my Restaurant.com certificate, the conditions stated on the certificate are that minimum purchase of $35.  We (there were four of us) went there on a Saturday.  We were a bit surprised with the setting/seating arrangements, but we were willing to give it a try.  We decided to try a few different dishes (they came in a take away Styrofoam container).  When it was time to pay, we presented  the certificate.  The certificate was not accepted because it was only good for Sunday buffet with a minimum of 5 guests (buffet costs around $11/person, which is actually less or about the same than our bill - back to this later).  No where on the certificate nor the Restaurant.com site for that specific restaurant states either those conditions.  This is an absolute bait-and-switch tactic.
This is the 2nd place that I tried using the certificate from Restaurant.com that changes the acceptance policy.  I have contacted Restaurant.com and their only response was to exchange the certificate with one from another restaurant.  I feel cheated by both Restaurant.com &amp; the restaurants.  They didn&#39;t take into consideration the travel time and money that we spent under a false promised of $25 certificate.  I don&#39;t think I will ever buy another certificate from Restaurant.com.  
Back to our bill, it was $57 for mediocre food.  Remember there is no menu, so these food are not cook to order.  No idea how long these foods had been sitting in those hot plates."

Menu changes every weekend and the desserts are absolutely delicious.

However, if you have a real sense of adventure and love delicious &#34;mystery&#34; food, then you will love this place!!!!  Don&#39;t be afraid to ask anybody there what certain dishes are, they&#39;d be more than happy to help your sheltered ass.  

Chances are when you get there, they will have a few of their delicious stand-by&#39;s like crispy mini eggrolls, fried crispy pork, beef stew with red peppers and potatoes, and seafood spaghetti noodles topped with crushed up pork rinds.  Crazy I know, but ohhhh soooo good!  A true meat lovers, pork lovers paradise!!!  Not very vegetarian friendly nor should they be.  Want a salad?  Then take your candy ass to Subway because Filipino food was created for carnivores like myself.

When I first opened the door, the aroma was saying &#34;welcome to home cooking&#34; and it felt like walking into mom&#39;s kitchen!  

The place was very clean and I was impressed that there was a little grocery area and that helped me killl two birds with one stone by picking up a few last minute ingredients to make Beef Steak that night.  

I wanted to have a few FILIPINO catered dishes for a birthday dinner that my husband and I were hosting at our home. Here is what we ordered and what everyone thought of:

1. Lumpia shanghai, not greasy, seasoned very well and not salty! Everyone was asking if I made them, I wish I could say yes... but that was an open door for me to promote this place. 

2. Bihon, cooked just right; we reheated it at home by adding a little bit of lemon juice. The flavor and taste was really good and it smelled &#34;fresh&#34; not overcooked or old. 

3. Pork BBQ - everyone&#39;s favorite, it was cooked tender with tangy flavor! 

4. Leche Flan - This had to be the ICING on the cake!  Excellent!!  This was devoured even before the birthday cake itself! 

Finally the place also has pan de sal ready to go, along with ensamada and hopia of all sorts. 

Set back, catering was bit high on the pricey-side.  Next time I&#39;ll just bring my friends in for the buffet. The staff is VERY FRIENDLY and because of my huge purchase, and that they are  focused on customer satisfacationI was offered an extra leche flan to take home.  They DO TAKE CARE of their customers!

We have yet to try the buffet for 9.99 and no doubt - we&#39;ll expect a line at the door because as I said, the food is as good as everyone writes!

We stood at the door for a while until we realized that we weren&#39;t going to be seated, it seemed like we were supposed to claim the table we wanted and bus it ourselves. 

Once we found seating and moved the dirty dishes to an unoccupied table we kinda sat around waiting for a server or some sort of acknowledgment but nothing happened so we grabbed drinks from the little grocery section and started the buffet.

The food was actually really good. It would have been nice to see labels on the dishes to know what we were eating. And it didn&#39;t seem like a lot of the choices were ... staples. I noticed that when one food would run out it wasn&#39;t always replaced by the same dish... sometimes a whole new dish would take its place. It was all tasty though.

I&#39;d love to see more desserts but the choices we had were delicious. 

When we finally finished we waited around for a check... but, nothing ever came so we went up to the register to pay.

Dishes in the buffet change but the ones that I can remember is they always offer some sort of soup, shanghai eggrolls, bistek, lechon, kare-kare, diniguan, basically the typical popular filipino foods.  There are a lot more dishes but those are the ones I usually keep getting a new plate for.  Ooh you can&#39;t forget the desserts and sago to drink.  The buffet is a great way to taste all of the popular filipino dishes.

I love how they have fried fish already made.  I think it is a bit expensive but I&#39;d rather buy the cooked fish then cooking it yourself and stinking up your house or even the neighborhood if you cook it outside!"

Yesterday my husband and I wanted taco bell so we went to their drive thru. I almost ran out of gas waiting in this line. It took us 25 minutes to get thru the line. I ordered at the speaker and the kid talking to me asked if what was on the screen was correct and it was not. I told him what it should say again and a woman took over taking my order. We finished that pretty quickly then proceeded to wait in line. 

I got to the window after 20 minutes and was not greeted by a young boy. He took my card and did not say hello or thank you even after I said both. Then we waited another 5 minutes. We had ordered 2 drinks and the boy did not give them to us. Instead we watched him twiddle his thumbs while we waited. After 5 minutes he handed us the bag of food and no drink. I told him we needed our drink and then this is what really got me. &#34; What kind of drinks did you order?&#34; Seriously, you have a screen that says it. He made the drinks and we left. 

I give 2 stars because the food was the right food, it was not good but it is what we ordered. Also they give you mints and moist towelettes. Otherwise this Taco Bell is pretty bad. I haven&#39;t really had a good experience here ever but I am a glutton for punishment I guess."

Don&#39;t understand the point of being late night if you aren&#39;t open late night. It was definitely frustrating, not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but as this is the closest TB to us, it is really poor to close that early. If you&#39;re not going to stay open for what your signs intend, then update your store open and close signs so that when people drive up to a completely shut down store and see that it&#39;s supposed to be open till 3, but clearly closed before 1 am on a Friday nonetheless, they won&#39;t be completely pissed off at why it&#39;s not open.

Today, I still enjoy stopping by and having a meal at Taco Bell. Fortunately, the frequent cravings for this crap has subsided. Within the past year, when I feel the urge, this is where I find myself ordering from the most.

Tonight, I had the opportunity to dine at an authentic Mexican restaurant, Senor Taco, which is literally within walking distance from this Taco Bell&#39;s location.

I don&#39;t like the new menu. It&#39;s colorful with too many pictures. One may think it&#39;s designed for the illiterate. I have a hard time locating what it is that I&#39;m craving for..
 
I decide on the #8 which are three hard, soft or both shell tacos and a drink. As far as fast food places go, this is the only one that offers all four food groups in every item I order. That&#39;s how I justify passing the McDonald&#39;s across the street and paying a little more for something &#34;healthy&#34;."

The nacho cheese is sometimes way too spicy and yet today it was beyond bland. The meat usually disgusts me yet today it was tasty. The inconsistency has me undecided about returning but the service gets me coming back... That and my kid who begs for it.

I ordered a large meal for my family and didn&#39;t think to check the bags when I got them. Well I drove out of the drive thru and into the road to get stopped at the red light. As I was sitting there I saw a Taco Bell man flailing his arms and running to my car. I rolled down my window and to my utter shock he had come just to hand me my burrito that they forgot to put in the bag. That was the only thing I ordered so he literally saved my dinner!!

Good mashed potatoes, awesome corn bread, stuffing was out of this world (tasted just like mom&#39;s). The Sunday special was $17.95, and so worth it - I couldn&#39;t even finish half the plate! We ordered the pistachio gelato for dessert and it was a good choice. Nice and light and not too sweet, and that nutella crust was really tasty.

Decor - So beautiful. The lights, the Christmas decorations, the music...it was all perfect. It felt like a very romantic and cozy setting.

Service - That&#39;s where the one star got knocked off. We waited for awhile in the lobby because there wasn&#39;t a receptionist there to attend to the crown of people building up. Our waitress got distracted in the middle of our order by a customer behind us, so we were interrupted for a little bit during that process. I think I was expecting just a touch more of better quality service to match with the Millrose concept.

They are closing for renovations after dinner service on Christmas Eve. I&#39;m glad I got to make it there before then, and I&#39;m looking forward to visiting the new space!"

Decor:
A very clean and neat place first of all when you walk right in.  Has a woodsy look to it which gives it that pure country Americana feel to it.  It is a wonderful looking place that has a very cozy feel to it.

Service:
The service was impeccable and impressive. There is nothing that I could complain about when it came to the service.  The wait staff was kind, polite and down to Earth. When you needed something they brought jt out right away. Absolutely excellent service. 

Food:
The food was fantastic.  I had the oven roasted chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I could tell the chicken was well seasoned amd had been cooking for a good while before being served.  I always like places that care about quality over profits.  Also the portions are extremely generous since they give you half a whole chicken.  There had to be rosemary, pepper, salt and butter in the chicken.  Can&#39;t go wrong with this dish here!

Price:
I can&#39;t tell what the price was since I went here for a wedding party.  However, you can always call in and ask for the prices.  

Overall experience:
A very good place with good food and excellent service.  I had a wonderful time!"

The atmosphere is the selling point here because the enormous barns that make up the restaurant are beautiful. 

On a side note: The blonde hostess (probably in her 50&#39;s) is a real sour-puss. I was taking a look around the beautiful restaurant and sour-puss kept glaring at me like a mother goose and making me uncomfortable. Stay away from that sour-puss."

I went here on a Friday night recently with a group of friends: 5 gals who get together every month in the suburbs. It was picked by one woman because, as many have noted in other reviews, it used to be great. It also had live music, a certain Tony Ocean. I read the bad reviews but figured, it will probably be good enough, so let&#39;s just go.

Issue #1: the service. In addition to yakking our ears off about how she can&#39;t keep beer lists straight because she works 3 jobs, our server literally disappeared between drink and food ordering. I&#39;m talking 15-20 minutes. When she finally returned, we had gotten one order in when the food was being &#34;dropped&#34; (as she kept repeating) at a nearby table of hers and she needed to go over and assist with that before taking the rest of our orders. She also reeked of cigarettes, and while I understand many people take smoke breaks in food service, clearly others have figured out how to not come back smelling like it. Lastly, when we asked about our food (which was mostly ordered off the pub menu and were not complex dishes) she said, &#34;Yep, it&#39;s cooking. It&#39;s gotta be cooked before it comes out.&#34; Perhaps not their best hiring decision.

Issue #2: the music. It was extremely loud, and very tacky. It gave the whole place a vibe that I think, unfortunately, it&#39;s going for: a restaurant and bar for empty-nested suburbanites looking to &#34;let loose&#34; on a Friday night. Everyone there over 55 looked like they were having a great time dancing and singing along to the oldies but goodies that Tony Ocean kept churning out. Literally, there was a guy that looked like Rod Stewart, who at first was just dancing with all the ladies and then, at the end, turned out to be another singer in the &#34;band.&#34; Wow. We usually close down a restaurant when we get together, sitting around talking, but we left when we couldn&#39;t handle the volume anymore.

Issue #3: the food. What&#39;s one thing that&#39;s pretty hard to screw up? A BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Well guess what, this, too, was sub-par. My sweet potato waffle fries (the best part!!) came in a quantity of five, which was deeply disappointing. I was only happy to note that the sandwich wasn&#39;t too expensive, I had waffle fries as an option to sub in, and they had bottled Angry Orchard cider. Thank god for small favors.

All in all, I highly discourage anyone who is not from the NW suburbs and over 60 to go here. If you do go, order off the less-expensive pub menu, and get ready to never see your server."

An incentive that brought us back was their promotion for a full slab of ribs for $10 and I was glad to take advantage while the deal was valid. I usually don&#39;t order ribs out, which is a shame because I love them, but they require a commitment and a dozen or so moist towelettes, but here I didn&#39;t care.

Go rib or go home.

Millrose has a real, classic, country feel; this is made so with their wood grains and antler chandeliers which adds nicely to their charm. We didn&#39;t have reservations and the wait was substantial, so we decided to sit in the bar area upstairs. It was fairly dark so it was a little challenging as far as a dining experience, but if we were just there for drinks and apps it would have been great. 

After ordering, our drink orders came, however the beers we received were incorrect. Our server was apologetic and very quick to correct the error so there was really no harm done. I did note that the bartender was spending some time chatting up the (seeming) regulars, but didn&#39;t get the beers right; I would have docked a star for that typically, but our server handled the situation seamlessly. 

Ultimately, ribs were good; I ate them all and my fries. I wouldn&#39;t get them again probably, but just so I can try something else on the menu. I&#39;d probably have to wait for another promotion or coupon/groupon  to come around, but I&#39;ll certainly keep my eyes peeled for it. I&#39;d also like to check out the country store but I&#39;ll have to leave that for another time...but don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll review that too. 
Enjoy."

Before homecoming in high school (and I don&#39;t remember it because it was that long ago)
During a pub crawl (and I don&#39;t remember it because there were three other stops before that one...so....whoops)

So when the in-laws wanted to celebrate two family birthdays here the other day at their Sunday brunch, I was curious to see how it would be.  Since my last two times were...unmemorable.

There were ten of us (including two kids) and each adult is $20.  The kids are $12, I think.  In any case, it was definitely not worth it.

They have a good concept set up (non alcoholic drinks are included, and your waitress will get those for you) and you tell your waitress what kind of omelet you want or if you want sunny side up eggs.  Five people ordered omelets, and they took FOREVER to come out.  At least 30 minutes.  And they weren&#39;t even very good, that&#39;s the worst part.

And my poor husband was waiting to eat his other food because he wanted room for the omelet, so he was really sad the whole time.  Sad and hungry.  Not cool at a buffet.

The rest of the food was lackluster.  The ham was dry, most of the food was cold, and it was just a dreary experience all around.  Definitely not worth the hefty $20 price tag.

Our waitress was really nice and attentive, so I will give her that.  She definitely did the best she could, but it just didn&#39;t really impress all that much.  I definitely wouldn&#39;t go back for brunch.  They seem to cater to an older crowd, but it was even sparse at 11:30 in the morning."

Tough call for dinner but went with the octoberfest special. I went for the prime rib but decided to try the special, Pork schnitzel with sour cream mashed potatoes and sliced beets. Great flavor over all.  I would of liked the pork to be a bit more tender but still good.  German sausage soup was awesome.  My husband had 1/2 rib s and chicken and the ribs fell of the bone. He is pretty picky and thought it was great.

5 stars for ambience. Outside had a fireplace and the courtyard was beautifully decorated for fall. The whole restaurant is rustic and decorated for fall.

We had our wedding reception (second marriage for us both) at Millrose in 2008, and everything was exceptional, from the food and drinks at the bar, to the service. And we chose it for its warm yet casual atmosphere, and the fact that dinners there had always been wonderful.

Fast forward to 2012. I was looking for a place to host meetings for an organization I belong to. It was a big request, because we need volunteer vendors to hold our events - we don&#39;t have the funds to pay for it ourselves. (We aren&#39;t non-for-profit, but pretty darn close.) I thought, having spent $1000&#39;s there in the past, they might be able to accommodate us in someway. We are willing to run our meetings during off-hours to stay out of the way of staff, and we also are willing to do in on-hours, and have ale cart services for members who DO want to eat. And of course, it brings potential customers through the doors every month, who might stick around for lunch.

The reception I got was extremely cold. Evidently another women&#39;s group that bears no resemblance to ours had been a bad deal for them, so the woman in charge (who clearly sounded like I was wasting her time) would have none of it. Really wouldn&#39;t even hear me out.

That was NOTHING like their customer service in the past. And as I read more recent reviews. sounds like the food is taking a nose-dive as well. Sad."

Met a friend for lunch today and we were one of the few parties in the place at 1130am on a Sunday (and no offense, the only party under 60), and it stayed that way until we left at 1:00pm.  After our experience I am guessing I know why:

Service - our server seemed new, yet it appeared he was one of the only servers in the place.  He was handling the patio and inside tables adjacent to the patio. He did not know the menu when asked very basic preparation questions. We had to flag him down to order drinks, replace a drink that was wrong, order our meal, get refreshes and ask where our food was 40 minutes later. (we ordered very simple breakfast plates - nothing crazy fancy here).

Our server said that the &#34;kitchen has been messing up all day, they are probably still sleeping back there&#34; which made me want to leave immediately.  He said the food would be out &#39;I think probably in about 5 minutes for sure&#34; ??

Finally received breakfast one hour after ordering it and it was correct. It was eggs, bacon, toast for me and waffle w syrup for my friend.  Nothing worth waiting an hour for.  

4.  After consuming the meal, the server came back to tell us that he was leaving soon, that the restaurant closes from noon to 2pm on Sundays (??) to prep for dinner.  I guess this is a Supper Club now but they are open at 9 - noon on Sundays...maybe this is why people aren&#39;t here, they don&#39;t get the hours and the concept.  He said we could stay as long as we wanted, which we did, but we won&#39;t be able to get anything until the restaurant reopened at 2:00. 

My suggestion to this restaurant - 1.  update the decor - people want to eat good food in a pleasant atmosphere that does not smell musty 2.  upgrade the service and cook staffs - teach your servers to be mindful of the customer, help them understand the menu, remind them they are &#34;servers&#34;.  and 3. market yourself the way this restaurant used to so that you can bounce back, attract new and existing customers - otherwise it does not appear you&#39;ll be in business much longer and that would be very sad."

Appetizer: bacon and jalapeño shrimp - 3 large shrimp that were cooked perfectly and wrapped in bacon that was just the right amount of crispy, all glazed in a teriyaki glaze and served over chili cilantro sauce.

Entree: I had the pot roast - it was very tender and pulled apart so easily. It was served with vegetables, garlic mashed potatoes and gravy that helped offset the slight dryness to the meat.

Dessert:  kahlua chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream on top. They offer small portions of each of their dessert options which is awesome, the small portion was the perfect size for me!"

Because I was with friends, I did not want to make a fuss, so I took most of it home.  Another friend at the table had the ribs which he also mentioned were cold.

The host did not escort our party to the table, he simply told us our table was in the back of the restaurant and pointed.  The funny thing is everyone else that walked into that establishment was escorted to their table.

Our server was notified of our displeasure and told &#34;management&#34; (I use that term very loosely) and instead of coming to speak with us the &#34;manager&#34; sent out three free appetizers.  In an effort to make my aunt&#39;s big day joyful we disregarded the rude service we&#39;ve received and ordered dinner.  We ordered the prime rib, roasted chicken and a pasta dish with red sauce.  The prime rib was awful.  We&#39;ve been to Gibson&#39;s and other steakhouses before and have had prime rib before, but this meat that was served was just absolutely awful.  We asked that the server please send &#34;management&#34; to our table and replace the Prime Rib meals with roasted chicken.

One of the waitresses found it appropriate to yell across the restaurant that there was no more chicken and that she was going to have the chef cook the steak longer.  The temperature of the meat wasn&#39;t the problem, it was the taste or lack there of.  After not being accommodated and growing more and more angry we asked again for the &#34;manager&#34; and to remove the prime rib meals from our bill and to bring out the birthday cake that we brought to the establishment for my aunt.  We were then told that it would cost $1 per slice to cut our cake.  Needless to say we opted to use a knife at the table and cut our own cake, but we couldn&#39;t do that because the &#34;manager&#34; came and put the icing on the cake of ruining our joyous moment.  She came to the table very rude and defensive of our displeasure with her establishment and the food.  She proceeded to act very inappropriately in front of her two assistant managers and spoke in a very condescendingly to the party.  

Instead of coming to the table with apologies and solutions.  She came, I don&#39;t know about an hour after she heard our first complaint and continued to say this was all a mishap because we were all confused about what Prime Rib was.  My aunt and I proceeded to tell her she was being rude and also let her know why we were displeased with the service we had received.  We gave her examples and again her remarks were inappropriate excuses.  We didn&#39;t yell, never rose our voice, didn&#39;t speak an ounce of Ebonics or vulgar language.  That didn&#39;t stop the &#34;manager&#34; from getting riled up, she asked us to hurry and finish up so we could get out, told us to contact her boss and it didn&#39;t matter if we did because she was the VP.  She and assistants then left the table to call the Barrington police on us.

I rarely use the race card, but I can say as of that night I know what it looks like to be racially discriminated against.  I would have received a better meal and service at Ihop across the street.  When we left this HORRIBLE place we had dinner and laughed at the comedians on stage at the Schaumburg Improv.  This lady and her staff may have ruined our dinner, but they did not ruin our night nor my aunt&#39;s milestone moment."

I admit its been a year and a half since my last visit which typically was about once a year. But where are the high backed chairs? Where are the king crab legs that were cut open for you so all you had to do was enjoy those huge pieces of sweet seafood? And oh my god where is the Beer!? 

Not only do they not have their own labeled beer anymore, what they do have is not up to the level of a place that once cared so much about beer they either brewed or commissioned their own beers!  Dark Star where have you gone, our nation turns its thirsty eyes to you!

It&#39;s as if the old generation retired and the next generation got rid off low margin options in order to squeeze every penny of profit out of that joint.

He&#39;s where I&#39;d put my review of the actual food (vs. just writing about what the restaurant used to be), but honestly it wasn&#39;t worth reviewing.  I&#39;m not even going to mention how my Prime Rib order wasn&#39;t taken because they ran out. This happens, but the chef didn&#39;t get that news to our waitress until 20 minutes after we ordered.  I don&#39;t get it. You have x pounds of prime rib.  You have two size orders.  You have computers the waitresses enter the orders into. Order goes in, subtracts the order from the remaining inventory, if greater than what&#39;s left... Reject.  Annoying.

If I&#39;m around and hungry, I&#39;d consider, but I am no longer going out of my way to eat here again.  In fact, I may just try the place across the street if in the area next time, they seem to get good reviews.

Bye old Millrose Restaurant &amp; Brewing Co., ol&#39; pal ol&#39; friend. Hello Newman, I mean Millrose Banquet and something. (Did I mention the name change?)"

We started with a shrimp cocktail, the sauce was good the shrimp fit their description...shrimp.  Meh.

The free bread was good, the drinks were served in larger glasses but were only half filled....again Meh.

We both ordered ribs the price was not bad but then the server mentioned that they used to be more expensive...probably meant they used to be a lot better as well.   The taste left behind a very nasty after taste and the sauce at first wasn&#39;t bad but as it cooled off it just became this over sweet paste.

I asked the server about the hours of the market and I ended up waiting a half an hour for that answer and wouldn&#39;t have gotten one if I didn&#39;t say something to remind her.

Overall we loved the decor but will not be going back for the dinner again..."

I always liked the beer samplers and basic bar burger food, but thought it was a little pricey for a big piece of meat that I probably don&#39;t want and if it was really a special occasion I probably wouldn&#39;t go THERE, but not bad for the burbs, AND well located off the tollway and Barrington Road. So when we had some company in town, who I know often goes for the big piece of meat, I thought of Millrose. Of course we show up so late on a Thursday night at 8:59 (found out LATER the kitchen closes at 9). You could tell the pretty hostess wasn&#39;t thrilled but SHE was leaving as soon as she seated us, and then everything was very good. Alfredo was our happy to see us server and did a great job with everything, including a couple good BYOB bottles, $15 corkage, no problem, and we were LATE.

We had everything from fajitas to ribs, greek chicken &amp; a panko pork schnitzel, and it was all very good. Quietly perfectly served, decent fries and salad/sides.

So we are moving them up from the &#34;beautiful day OUTDOOR burger&#34; forgotten list to the &#34;late snowy lunch or dinner by the fireplace&#34;. It IS a gorgeous place, and just ignore the fact that you ARE now turning into your parents eating here instead of at the hipster Lucky Monk (very good).

While the menu was diverse, it was extremely over-priced. Trying to compete near Morton&#39;s or Ruth&#39;s Chris prices, I expect more. The steak was tough and not quality. I believe the Mahi-Mahi was the cause of my violent &#34;rejection&#34; last night; however, I am not a clinician. 

As noted earlier, drinks were over-priced as well. 

The management needs a major make-over with quality and pricing."

This is definitely a place that appeals to older folks: when we walked in the door, everyone in the lobby was at least 80 years old -- it was like you had to be on Medicare to get on the waiting list for a table. I felt positively like an infant next to this crowd.

Once we got past God&#39;s Waiting Room, we were seated in a large, dark dining room. This place is very large overall, lots of seating but not a lot of light. 
Our waitress was middle-aged, brisk and peppy, and had clearly worked there for a while. She gave us time with the lunch menu, which consisted largely of salads, sandwiches and burgers. 

I chose the Mini Trio, three sliders composed of different fillings: seared beef and onions; pulled BBQ pork; and crab cake with remoulade. The crab was good; the sauce on the pork was too sweet, and the beef had a good taste but was tough (I had a hard time ripping it apart with my teeth; not very successful as a burger). The fruit cup that came with it was good (particularly the pineapple), and the cream of mushroom soup I ordered (the Soup du Jour) was excellent. 

My grandmother&#39;s friend (who&#39;d picked the restaurant) had said the place was known for pork, but I didn&#39;t really see it reflected too much in the menu, until we went to the &#34;country store&#34;. This was more than just a Cracker-Barrel-type shop; they had meat-to-go in here (ribs! steaks! bacon! more!), plus gourmet goods of all kinds, an impressive selection of wine, and then various gifty items (my mom bought a pretty necklace -- not exactly what you&#39;d expect in a place that also sells bulk bacon). 

People clearly know this shop well -- again, this was the week of Christmas, and they were stuffed into the shop, going for the meat in particular. We filed past the cooler with the pork in it and it was full of  packs of thick-cut bacon; when we walked back 10 minutes later a guy was stuffing every package (at least 6 or 7) into his basket! I bought some of the thin-sliced (not being a fan of thick-cut bacon -- I guess I&#39;d have been out of luck anyway, though!) and made some the next day; it had a great, maple-y scent and a woodsy flavor. They definitely know what they&#39;re doing with the pork! 

Though I might not rush back to the restaurant, I&#39;d certainly swing into the store the next time I&#39;m in the Schaumburg area. Millrose meat can&#39;t be beat!"

So after a long day at the Arlington Million we decided to head on over to the Millrose. For a Saturday night we had no problem being seated immediately, the hostess was very nice, and our waitress was prompt and informative. I was surprised at the menu. It was very toned down from what I remember and I am one that likes selection. We ordered some appetizers that included sweet potato tater tots. The tots came out and were very small portions. Let&#39;s move on to the main course - our party of 5 ordered the pot roast, dinner salad, etc. They were prepared to our standards but still we were not impressed.

We were not impressed with the variety of their offerings - just the basics.  The french toast was like rubber, the smoked salmon looked unappetizing (a color smoked salmon should NOT be) and the sweets table looked like they had just run to the local supermarket and picked up some donuts, etc. to put out.  The sausage, potatoes and carving station were decent, but that&#39;s about it.  You&#39;d be better off just going to a regular breakfast restaurant and ordering off the menu."

Absolutely none of the food stood out.  It&#39;s a very comfortable, well run restaurant.  The breakfast brunch selection on Sunday is good - carvery, custom made omelets, and lots of very pedestrian choices in warming pans.  Biscuits and gravy that were completely tasteless.  Smoked salmon, but no crackers or thin sliced bread, just pathetic looking bagels.  Desserts are there for quantity, not quality.  Good sausages, decent waffles, and plenty of omelet ingredient choices.  

If you want to have brunch in this area, it&#39;s a good choice.  As long as you&#39;re very hungry and not very picky."

I remember back in the day when going out for a steak meant heading out for a thinly sliced cut of mediocre meat doused with tenderizer.  This is the emotion that the Millrose evokes.  
We went for a prime rib dinner at 7:30 on Saturday night. Lo and behold, they were sold out of their weekend specialty at this &#34;late&#34; hour of the evening.  They up-sold us to the rib-eye which is the same cut of beef but at at twice the price.  The steaks are Choice grades - not the better graded Prime cuts that most steak houses in the city offer. 
Damn you Gibsons!  It looks like you have spoiled me with your prime cuts, fine service and massive deserts."

The decor and warm ambience alone is well worth the trip. Food = amazing especially the half chicken dish. My favorite dish however is the mini lava cakes.

Nothing else. The ribs had very little meat and tasted like they had slathered them in ketchup, not bbq sauce. There was no crispy, carmelized top on the ribs like what I am used to. They seemed like they were just boiled and then some ketchup thrown on them and stuck in an oven. Not very tasty. I barely at 1/4 of the slab. My daughter had the chicken franciese which was good, but waaaaaay overpriced. It was $20 for this dish and the portion was small. We also ordered the fried calamari which was breaded with cornmeal. Although the calamari was very tender, it had no crisp whatsoever and was served in a small soup bowl and then sat in the grease so it made it even soggier. These were priced at 9.95 again, for a tiny portion that weren&#39;t even worth 1/2 that. My husband opted for the burger. It was good. We were told that their &#34;steak burger&#34; consists of the scraps from all of their meats which are thrown together and then ground down for their burger. Ewww! They should call it a &#34;scrap burger&#34; not a steak burger. But my hubby did enjoy it. I had a bite and found it very fatty and grizzly (sp?). The only reason for two stars is for the ambiance and warm homey feel you get here. Love the fireplaces, all the wood and the servers are pretty good.

They never hurry you out and the hosts are always friendly.  They run entertainment specials from time to time, like dinner and a show.  This is a family place good for grandma, grandpa and the kiddos.  

I like the prime rib ladies cut.  Served with a soup or salad, potato and veggie of the day.  Hubby likes the chicken cordon blue with marsala sauce and also served with soup or salad.

We then went to a well-run Prime Steak restaurant 7 miles east and spent the money we had planned to spend at Millrose on a fine drama free meal with great service.

On the most recent visit, however, we were a bit surprised to see how few cars there were in the parking lot and how few patrons were in the restaurant.   After our dinner arrived, I began to understand a bit better.

During the entire dinner, we swatted gnats, fruit flies, and a large house fly.   This is inexcusable, particularly because there are plenty of safe and effective ways pest control companies can fix this problem.

The food was okay (not great), the drinks were watery-tasting, but the absolute worst part of the experience was the many different types of flies.   I&#39;m sure there&#39;s an excuse for this, but the best excuses in the world don&#39;t prevent unsanitary conditions ... or bring once-loyal customers back to a restaurant, which judging from the many lackluster reviews, has had better days in years past."

I feel like I should only review this place if I had a full meal here, but oh well, still gonna rate my drink experience here.

First of all, drinks are WAY expensive here.  I was not expecting to dish out $9 for a martini here--I know that can be a typical price for a martini in the burbs, but this isn&#39;t a fancy place to me.  I feel like $9 for a martini should be spent at a steakhouse where they are going to use top shelf liquor, not Smirnoff.  My boyfriend&#39;s beers were about $5, so not terrible, but they weren&#39;t amazing to him.

Anyway, we were not directly at the bar, we were seated at the little tables and our waitress was just terrible.  First of all, the bar is like an arms length away and it still takes her about 15-20 mins to get our drinks.  Also, since we said we were just drinking, she felt that she didn&#39;t need to come up to us at all and ask how things were, if we needed water, etc.  And when we wanted our check, it took FOREVER.  Let me put this into perspective here--my boyfriend and I got two drinks each and we were there for 2 1/2 hours.  Service was slow and not worth the money."

Yeah, not anymore.

Wednesday night, 7:30, we were one of maybe three parties in the place. And we *still* had slow service. Greeted by a waitress we never saw again. Had to walk from our table in the bar to the actual bar to get a beer.

Accidentally grabbed a dinner menu instead of a bar menu and about fell off my chair. There wasn&#39;t an item on the whole menu for less than $25. Prices ranged upwards toward $40. A *baked potato side dish* was $5.50. Bad math, guys: 1/3 the customers x 3 times the price does not = same profits. Sheesh.

Bar menu ended up being much more reasonable and the food was actually pretty good. I split a &#34;flight&#34; of little sandwiches with my pal: little prime rib (x2), little hamburger with chipotle mayo, little pulled pork. Green bean fries were yum. But lack of waitstaff and customers added up to a disturbing ghost-town atmosphere and slow service... can&#39;t say I&#39;m anxious to return soon."

The bartender and the waitress was talking and the bar tender finally took my drink order and asked if I wanted a menu. Uhh, yeah. I wanted a bone-in rib eye which was $34.95 supposedly 21 days dry aged. They also had a &#34;special&#34; Delmonico boneless rib eye but I wanted the bone-in for the flavor. It eventually came and it was a boneless. When I called them on it they came up with the lamest BS story of how some bone-in rib eyes have bones and some don&#39;t. This was hysterical. I happen to know the anatomy of cows and the various cuts of steaks and Instead of going all Gordon Ramsay on them, I just laughed and went with it. I&#39;ll just vote with my wallet and never go back. There&#39;s a reason guys why it was a ghost town at 8:00 pm on a holiday weekend and the Funky Monk across the street was packed (I went there afterwards) and could barely get a seat at the bar. Wise up! The flavor on the steak was good, but that wasn&#39;t the point!"

Finally, on a Saturday afternoon we decided to make a special trip to try the beer at this place that proclaimed itself a brewery on the sign by the street.

The atmosphere was nice. The hostess sat us inside by a window as we requested. There were also nice tables outside in a shaded courtyard, but we preferred to observe from air conditioned comfort.

The first thing we asked the waiter was of course what beers they had on tap. There was no beer menu with detailed descriptions of the beers as I am accustomed to seeing at places that brew their own beer.
The waiter quickly went through the list:
pale ale, pilsner, amber ale, dark lager... commercial brew #1... I stopped him there to save time.

It was interesting that he described the dark lager as being &#34;not too heavy even though it is dark&#34;. My hopes were starting to sink at this point, because it started to look like this was not a beer lovers place.

I ordered the amber ale and my wife chose the dark lager. They were both served in tall pilsner glasses.

There was no noticeable aroma as I brought the glass to my nose. My first sip of the amber ale left me disappointed, but that wasn&#39;t my final judgment. I soldiered on and kept trying it. I wanted to like it, but there just wasn&#39;t any flavor to this beer. The watery character and carbonation reminded me of the typical macro brews, although this beer was amber colored rather than the typical macro yellow.

At the same time, my wife was having a similar experience with the dark lager. I tried her beer as well (just for research purposes of course) and I was surprised at how similar it tasted to my amber ale. Other than a slightly more bitter flavor, I would be hard pressed to tell them apart in a blind taste test.

We gave up on the beer at this point. We just didn&#39;t have any confidence that the other two choices were going to be significantly better than what we had already tried.

While all this disappointing beer tasting was going on we did order food. The macaroni and cheese with crab and asparagus was very tasty and was served at a good temperature. We paired that with a lemon oregano chicken wrap. The wrap was fair, but the flavor was very mild for something with lemon and oregano in it.

I am unlikely to return to Millrose any time soon. The beer was extremely disappointing to me. The food was pretty good, but a little on the expensive side. I guess prices are going up everywhere, so this isn&#39;t surprising, but since I am looking for good beer, that is the deal breaker."

My wife finds it offensive when the maître d&#39; greets us with &#34;Hi guys&#34;.  She is clearly not a guy.  When seated we were only given appetizer menus, we saw a couple leave as there was nothing they wanted from that menu and they were not even offered a dinner menu.  An ad in the newspaper listed a mid-week rib special was not on the menu, not on the special list and we probably would not have gotten had we not asked for it.  The ribs were great, our server was excellent, attentive without hovering.  They need to bring back lunch service, at least during summer hours during the week."

So my wife and a couple of our friends ended up at the Millrose after visiting Goebert&#39;s Farm.  Although we all dress funny and we&#39;re from the big scary city, we know how to act in public.  

We ended up here because there were few options that weren&#39;t totally disgusting, such as the IHOP down the street.  We thought it was going to be a little less classy and little more... Cracker Barrel. Come on, they have a country store.  You&#39;d make the same mistake.

When we walked in, we realized this was the type of place grandparents go on wedding anniversaries and people visit after services at Willow Creek.  Whatever, we like food and we all have jobs and we&#39;re productive members of society, despite being a little goofy looking.  We were seated and our waitress was less than pleased that she had to serve us.  When I&#39;m in this situation, where I know I&#39;m being judged, I tend to be really polite and out going.  Kill the stereotype that punks are shitty people.  

We all order burgers, not because it was the cheapest thing on the menu, but because holy crap, the burgers have cranberries on them.  The waitress was really bummed that we got burgers and cokes, rather than entrees and drinks.  Sorry, half our group was straight edge and I didn&#39;t feel like drinking.  

The burger was fan-freakin&#39;-tastic.  Perfectly cooked on PUMPERNICKEL.  Seriously, that&#39;s why this place got stars.  The bill came and instead of putting the $100.00 bill on our card and collect the cash, we asked our waitress to put the difference on our card.  Yeah, it&#39;s a pain in the ass and if you don&#39;t want to do it, say so.  We&#39;ll be big kids and suck it up and deal.  Nope, she takes the pile of money and our card, comes back with a smaller pile of money and our card.  Not noticing that the pile-o-cash was shorter, we look at the receipt and realize she put the whole bill on our card.  No big deal, we&#39;re adults.  We&#39;ll make the trip to the bank with the cash.  Whatever.  What we realize on our drive home, that our waitress had possibly pocketed a chunk-o-cash, because there was less in hand than what our friends contributed.  

Here&#39;s the thing, I don&#39;t stiff people on tips.  No matter how good or bad the service is.  Really, the service was alright, despite disapproving looks from waitress.  The atmosphere was even cozy.  But don&#39;t pocket money as a tip without asking.  Especially after you mention that you added an 18% gratuity.  Had you played ball, you would have gotten 20%, or we would have even left you a couple bucks, despite the added gratuity.  

If that&#39;s how they do business, well, I&#39;d say I&#39;ll never go there again, but seriously, when am I going to end up in Barrington?  Sure, it was probably our mistake for assuming she&#39;d be honest and for complicating things, but seriously, communicate with your customers.  They might surprise you."

The place was pretty busy thus we were seated in their banquet hall.  We were eating on a plastic fold out table and chairs that could have been taken out from a high school cafeteria.  The rest of the place looked really nice.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come back for the food, maybe just to have a couple beers in the bar.

The food was sub par I had the Tilapia with crab and mozzarella cheese on top.  All I could taste was the cheese and who knows maybe it wasn&#39;t Tilapia because I couldn&#39;t taste it!  

The good news is, is that all of their beers were from my favorite Illinois brewery.  Two Brothers!!  I was able to order a beer for my entire family which I think they enjoyed more than the food."

It just wasn&#39;t good at all. It tasted like they were boiled and baked. Way too tender. The meat fell off the bone and you were able to swallow it without chewing. The meat was complete mush. The coleslaw was just nasty. Dessert was the Kahlua Lava Cake. It didn&#39;t taste like there was any Kahlua in it. For my wife and I, the bill was $90.00. I want a refund!

We came back a few years ago (because I had a entertainment coupon, or restaurant.com or some such) and it was disappointing. It was so expensive for okay food. Bummer. And they tried to argue about my coupon. However... I wrote the restaurant and the manager was very apologetic and sent me a gift card... so we tried again. Three drinks in the bar... $25 gift card.... $27 for the drinks. Really? Agh!

Fast forward to last month. Four of us stopped in for a cocktail after dining out at Wildfire in Schaumburg. The bar was not very crowded...at all. There was a band (blues mostly) and we really enjoyed them. We also enjoyed the fact that they had $4 margaritas and decent priced upscale beers. 8 drinks for under $40... nice. We didn&#39;t eat, so I can&#39;t comment, but it was nice to see they had some reasonable specials. 

The upper balcony area and side area in the bar were closed off (as is cloth draping) which was weird.... made it feel small in there. It&#39;s such a large, beautiful, ski-lodge feeling place usually. I guess I might give it one last try since they are regularly on restaurant.com (which usually says something in my book) for dinner. I do remember loving their french lamb chops (just not the greasy potato side dish that accompanied it). I know they were supposed to be famous for their meats (pork particularly?) but I gotta say, I make better ribs.... any day. Not sure if that&#39;s still their forte, but it never should have been.

So, what you really go for is the atmosphere... ski-lodge, fireplaces, lots of wood. I&#39;m holding my opinion on the food until we try dinner again."

I remember this place as crazy busy where you needed reservation to get a table. I also remember fantastic selection of food. 
Let me tell you - this was nothing like what I remember! Place was almost empty at ten in the morning on Sunday. But I am not surprised - the food was just what you would expect in a cheap neighborhood diner - very limites selection and completely nothing worth mentioning. No choices for people on any kind of diet, two bagel choices, nothing you would consider healthy. But the icing on the cake was the price - it was ridiculously high - even though we had nothing from the special menu - just plain smorgasboard serve yourself deal - we got charged like for a fancy dinner in a fancy restaurant - I certainly got a sticker shock when it came to paying.
So, if you want a toast, an egg, and a sausage link for the price of filet mignon that is your place. What the hell happened to the Milrose from ten years ago!!"

I have been going there for years and the food has been consistently good.

It was pretty decent, alright selection of food. Definitely could use more vegetable and meat options. They had some nice desert choices too. It wasn&#39;t really &#34;stellar&#34;, but it was acceptable enough that you&#39;re not forcing yourself to eat.

The one thing I did enjoy was that they will make you omelettes any way you want, on the spot. That is something I enjoy, as rudimentary as it is.

Now, the other side. Holy crap this place is expensive well beyond the quality! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come back here again unless my family chooses to or something."

We sat in their outside/porch area... the sun was in our eyes for about 10 minutes, but then it was quite pleasant. The awning works, but the umbrella tables don&#39;t have tilting umbrella, or staff who knows how to tilt them, so for an hour or two before sunset, you should be careful which table you accept.

Our waiter was friendly and made good suggestions about his &#34;Top 3&#34; favorites from the menu. A manager, I assume, tried to come over and strike up a conversation with us, but we were kind of deep in our own at the time... but points for trying, I guess.

I had a Fish and Chips (Friday special) which was really good... and I&#39;m happy to report that it kept me from feeling starved for the next 12 hours (fasting for some blood work the next morning). We also had the Pot Roast, a Ribs &amp; Chicken plate, a burger and I think the Prime Rib. Everyone enjoyed their meal quite a bit.

We were fairly full, but decided to get a few of their &#34;mini&#34; desserts anyway, and they were really excellent. I know one was a vanilla creme brulee, but I did not try that, as I believe it disappeared before I could. I don&#39;t remember which one it was that I had a bite of, but it was good stuff."
millrose-south-barrington,Amanda R.,PwC84RQuc3KtSSn8-TnL3A,"Villa Park, IL",0,1,0,4,28,keGj9glH7OO9fnU6T050wQ,2.0,2012-07-01,"The first thing I noticed about this place was the great atmosphere.  It&#39;s all wood decor, with so many different levels, which makes it nice and cozy.   The second thing was &#34;it&#39;s Saturday dinner time.  Where is everyone?&#34;  We had a large group, about 30 people, but didn&#39;t need to worry about a reservation.  They could&#39;ve fit five more of our groups in there without worry, it was that empty.

Then we got the menus.  I wish I&#39;d taken my hostess&#39; advise and checked this out on the website before I came, because I was not expecting the prices for a place so far out in the suburbs.  There were very few dishes under around $25, and this did not seem to be the sort of place to justify the expense.  The menu wasn&#39;t very extensive, and while there seemed to be one of each kind of dish (with a more extensive steak menu), if you didn&#39;t want to spent $25+ for your meal your options were VERY limited.  I pretty much had to choose between a burger, a pasta dish, or the tilapia.  The description of how they prepared the tilapia sounded bland, but the pork sounded yummy, with an apple glaze, pecans, a sweet potato, and vegetables.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t like pork.  So, at my request, and to their credit (although I got disapproving stares from the waitress and she asked me several times if I was sure), they gave me the tilapia with the pork glaze on the side to give it more flavor (unfortunately, they forgot the pecans).   The resulting tilapia was pretty decent, but the sweet potato was tiny and, along with the vegetables, surprisingly flavorless.  I&#39;ve had far better elsewhere, and for less money.  And MUCH better service.

On top of the meal, I had a gin and tonic.  That is the most I&#39;ve ever paid for a G&amp;T, despite the fact that I&#39;m often at clubs in the city, and it was in a tiny glass.  Also, when I asked the waitress if she would recommend a white or red wine with my meal, she had no idea.  She was nice, but definitely would&#39;ve fit in more with a breakfast diner than a $30+ per plate restaurant in the suburbs.

So, bottom line... Overpriced far-west suburban restaurant with great atmosphere, okay food, expensive drinks, and mediocre service.  Just a few miles east, there are far better restaurants that, despite their location, have better prices and more extensive menus."

The restaurant has a warm, cozy feel to it and seems wholesome and family oriented. 
The food is very Americana. Its the kind of food an American mom would make for you but upgraded. They also have a great selection of drinks. 

However, for the prices, I was expecting a bit more of a presentation of the food. I ordered the tilapia but you&#39;d never know it from just looking at it. It just seemed like everything was thrown on the plate-my sauce was running everywhere. The Tilapia was buried under the sauce, crab meat and cheese. It seemed the same with the other dishes my guests had. In their defense, I guess it does play to the &#34;feel at home&#34; theme. Though, the quality of the food did seem alright.

Service was great. My Uncle is usually a difficult person to deal with at restaurants but they handled him gracefully. Our server seemed very friendly and patient with our large group.

Overall, it&#39;s a very nice place, but not usually my cup of tea."

Had the $25.00 per person option on the menu. Sampled both appetizers and the shrimp bruschetta was delightful while the Italian sausage stuffed mushrooms only edible because they smothered in a red sauce.  The black bean cuban soup was good but lacked spice. The pan-seared chicken and veggies with gnocchi was great! The espresso martini out of this world.  Dessert.....ordered the waffle with gelato.....had hope.  Since it was nearing 7 we asked for our bill and desserts to go.  Got our bill.  Never saw the desserts 10 minutes later....had no choice but to leave.  Hope someone ate them.  The waitress was nice but must have had a million tables because we barely saw her.

Our server was horrible. She had three tables, including us, in her section and she couldn&#39;t manage it. It took her a long time to get our drinks out and then she brought out the bread after the appetizers right before we got our meal.

My boyfriend and I both got the burgers and she didn&#39;t even know which temperature was which. We had to send back the one because it wasn&#39;t medium rare, but more medium well. She then brings it back and says I think it is much closer to medium now. Uh what? Well that would be fine if medium was the temperature we ordered. We didn&#39;t want to deal with it so we just shut our mouth and ate it. Burgers sucked, the appetizers weren&#39;t anything special. Overall blah.

I&#39;ve stopped in for drinks a few years ago, but was very curious about the food.

I put in for reservations earlier in the day, and got seated right away.  It wasn&#39;t very busy at this point, but our server took some time to get our drink orders.  After our drinks were served, the server mentioned that we were going to be served by someone else that would take our food order.  15 minutes after our drinks came in, our food order had finally been taken by the new server.  By this point, we were starving.

My girlfriend had the Top Sirloin and I had the Cajun Chicken Penne.  The Cajun Chicken Penne was fantastic!  It was a tangy combination of penne pasta, andouille sausage, well-prepared chicken and a great sauce.  As for my girlfriend, the food was great, but they did not give her the Bearnaise sauce that was supposed to be with the steak.  And of all things, a steak knife wasn&#39;t given with the plate.  The butter-knife hardly made a dent, so after waiting a while for our waiter to swing by, we just asked a nearby busboy for a steak knife.

Overall, the food and drinks were really enjoyable.  The reoccurring problem just seemed to be the service on this particular night.  We did get comped a round of beers after the server noticed our small frustrations, so it was nice to see that they noticed and cared about the customer.  Either way, with the prices on the menu and the service, it may be sometime before we stop back in."

My wife and her mother,my daughter and a close friend went to this establishment on the night of the snow storm February 10, 2012.  We traveled an hour and a half for the entertainment that was offered that night along with a limited menu, wine included.  We had no idea what the food was going to be like.  We were pleasently surprized to find that the beef shortribs and the olive,artichoke stuffed chicken breast were 5 star quality.  The wine chosen to fit the meal was excellant.  The Millrose had this event in a private diningroom, but I was able to see the main room and the bar as we entered the establishmnet.  Cozy describes this place, sound does not travel far in their rooms. The bar was interesting to say the least.  The private room was complete with fireplace and deck out for Valentines Day.  Our friend said that it reminded her of a Vale Colorado ski lodge, mountain rustic I would call it.  It was very pleasent to me.  The staff were exceptional and more than willing to please in their service. I have no qualms about recomending this establishment for its food and circuses.  The entertainment that night was Opera and Love Songs by Diva Montell and Jerge Holmes.  The food and entertainment were worth that horrible drive in the winter storm.  We were all glad we attended this event.

I did notice a Country Store attached to this restaurant.  It was closed, but I think it would be worth the trip to check it out.  I have read the other reviews and beg to disagree with them.  I have no reason to doubt others experience here, so the likely situation is that this restaurant has improved its self and deserves a second look for them and a first look for those of you who have never been here to eat and drink.  By the way, I understand that Diva Montell will be returning here to sing in a few weeks.  That is when I plan to return and will be better for it, too."

I have never heard anything good about this place. I was &#34;delighted&#34; when I was taken here against my will. 

It was post-lunchtime, on a Saturday. There could not have been more than 10 other people in there. The hostess was busy talking to someone about how she needed her break, while we were ignored for a few minutes. We were seated, eventually, and had plenty of time to peruse the short, uninteresting menu. 

I decided on the ELEVEN dollar club. I was delirious and overheated....please cut me some slack. 

The server was adequate. Nothing more, nothing less. 

This eleven dollar joke of a club sandwich comes to the table. Tomato slices so thick you wonder if they just cut the stem and halved the darn thing...2 foot stacks of lettuce, uneven piles of not-great-turkey, and ONE piece of bacon....TOTAL. I am sorry, the word bacon got me, not bacos. Please, dont try to sprinkle a dash of bacos or beggin strips or what ever that was on a sammich and call it bacon. No. 

Dry bread. No offer of mustard, or mayo, or even a warning that this &#34;artisan&#34; bread will be so dry that it will julienne slice your esophagus. Sweet. 

There were 10 or so french fries on my plate. They were good. Go figure. 

Bastard sandwich + tomato halves + non-bacon + 10 fries + razor bread =/= 11.00

We&#39;ve been on a mission to only eat at places we haven&#39;t been to yet, so we decided to have the Sunday brunch. I drive by this place all the time and a lot of people in my family love it, so we figured, why not. What is it with hostesses lately who are too busy to look up and greet you? Uh, this is your job! I don&#39;t expect a red carpet roll out or anything, but how about a nice &#34;Hi! How ya doin&#39;?&#34; when I approach the hostess stand? I swear! We seriously waited at least a minute until we were even acknowledged and it wasn&#39;t like there was a ton of people waiting to be sat. 

The atmosphere was country farm house. This seems like a place with mostly older clientele. We were seated overlooking the outdoor patio and it looked really nice. Lots of fireplaces in here....I bet it would be nice when it&#39;s cold outside. 

The food was average at best. I know when we go to an all you can eat buffet, our expectations are low, but come on! At least keep the food looking nice when the tray is half empty! There was just one guy overlooking the whole room and he was also the meat slicer at the carving station which had ham and turkey.  Normal breakfast fare - eggs benedict, corned beef hash, waffles, french toast, country potatoes, cheese blintzes (made with large curd cottage cheese!?!?!), and scrambled eggs. There was a toaster they put out with a bread basket and some of their homemade jellies and a platter of lox, which I always look forward to, but it was all slimy and looked like it had been sitting out a long time. There was also oatmeal, a lot of fresh fruit and boxes of cold cereal and the pastry table of which nothing even looked good. I tried a &#34;cannoli&#34; and it was soggy and sad.  At $20 a person, I think they could have done a much better job.

Our server was nice enough, and I can see this being a nice place to come for a big family event or something, but I would not recommend it for the Sunday brunch."

On a Sunday night it was mostly empty and we were able to choose where we wanted to sit.  The food here is fairly standard, and we both chose the Prime Rib, a weekend offering.  This came with a baked potato and a side of green beans (not the Broccoli listed on the menu - a good thing as they were great).  We tried both sizes, and the meat was done perfectly.   Service from the &#34;sweet older lady&#34; was both competent and effiicient.  We finished with a 3 part &#34;Mini Deserts&#34; plate that was a good selection.  Prices can be rather high - the large Prime Rib is about $32 including the 2 sides."

I have to admit, being a beer guy, I was a little disappointed to find out they no longer brewed their own beer (it had been a couple years since we had been there), however, the rest of our experience made up for that.  My wife and I waited in the bar area for the rest of our party to show up.  They had some sort of special going on, so there were a few people waiting in the host area.  We thought we&#39;d get a drink and wait for everyone.  We were greeted by Allfredo, the friendly bartender.  The bar wasn&#39;t too busy, so we chatted at the bar for awhile, and Allfredo mixed up some great dirty martinis, with bleu cheese olives, my wife&#39;s favorite.  After the rest of our party showed up, we were escorted to the table, which was in a perfect location, away from most of the patrons. We had the pork tacos and the sampler platter as appetizers, and everyone thought the tacos were unique and tasty.  For our entrees, I ordered the pork chop, and it was divine!  My wife had the whitefish, and had plenty left over for the next day.  My in-laws had the ribs, and they said they were some of the best (although I didn&#39;t get a chance to try them). It was my mother-in-law&#39;s birthday, our great server, Laura, made sure to bring out a complimentary piece of cake, and that of course made my mom-in-law feel special!  Both the service and food were excellent! This was a great time had by all, and we will surely be back for the next family get-together!"

I was at the bar with a friend during the weeknight, so it wasn&#39;t too crowded.

The bar tender was very friendly and let me sample a few drinks before buying it.  I also enjoyed some of the live music being played in the background, set a nice vibe.

For food I ordered the sampler platter of appetizers  (forget the exact name).  Overall food wise, I was not too impressed.  The only thing I liked on the platter were the potato skins, everything else was either too dry or did not have enough flavor.  I was especially disappointed with the ribs.

Despite the food experience, I would definitely come back here again and try another meal."

I had the veggie fajitas. Limited vegetarian options- but still I can see myself going back. Had a classy feel to it, prices definitely on the expensive side. I should probably take off 2 stars for the crappy server and the horrible job at packing the food she did. But whatever-I had great company so the horrible server didnt bother me as much. If I wanted crappy service, I would have eaten at Burger King. This place needs to do a serious make-over of their staff."

Maybe my recent move to the Chicago area is giving me sticker shock at the prices of eating out here.  The lunch menu is essentially the dinner menu. They have a breakfast buffet when we were there on Sunday. But we wanted to eat the real fare so we opted for the dinner menu instead.

The ambiance of the Millrose is rich and cozy. And the patio is charming. Wicker chairs sit facing each other by the fireplace. There&#39;s even piano music on Friday and Saturday nights, according to their literature.

Prices start at $9 for appetizers. We had the Taste of Millrose appetizers that contain 3 coconut shrimp (not bad), Italian sausage and bratwurst (nicely herbed and flavored), meatballs, spicy wings, ribs, potato skins, and onion straws. It&#39;s definitely a good sampling of what Millrose has to offer. 

Our table had the jumbo lump crab cakes served with roasted pepper-corn relish and spicy remoulade sauce. The presentation is pretty and the crab cakes delectable. But not the best I&#39;d eaten. I thought Ted&#39;s Montana Grill&#39;s was better. 

The husband had the Rose&#39;s Ribs and Chicken. He opted for the bbq chicken instead of the herb-roasted chicken. He enjoyed both. And we all loveddddd the mashed potatoes. A little lumpy and oh so smooth.

I had the pot roast. I wasn&#39;t too excited when I tasted the tomato-based jus. It must be a regional flavor. I&#39;d never had pot roast cooked in this manner until arriving here. Ritzy&#39;s had the same treatment to their pot roast. But I was willing to overlook that and dissect the rest of the pot roast. The meat was tender and flavorful. You can certainly tell the difference between their meat and the hormon-injected ones sold at supermarkets. The sauce has hints of a good red wine. The carrots are hit or miss, in terms of texture. For $20, it was steep. 

Eating at the Millrose is not cheap, and I won&#39;t be returning anytime soon because of that. I may, however, be picking some of their meats at the country store should the husband and I plan to indulge in a good cookout at home.

*Photos shot

It&#39;s a great experience. Just be prepared to spend.

You can buy most of the meats in their country store, and the prices run high."

I ordered the medallion stake with potatoes and broccoli. The stake was very grey. Poor grade of meat I&#39;m guessing. It was very squishy! The potatoes were like paste. Very starchy.

We brought out of town visitors, hoping to have an entertaining evening; it was anything but. We waited twenty minutes just to have a drink order taken, yet the server had time to get dessert orders and bring checks to the remaining three tables in the dining area. Asked about a children&#39;s&#39; menu which she said she couldn&#39;t give because they were out - only wanted to know what FOOD was on them. She had to go look to see and came back ten minutes later and STILL didn&#39;t know. Manager came over and didn&#39;t do much, no apology, nothing. Tried to order wine. Of the three we picked out, server told us they were out. Would have been nice to know BEFORE we opened the list! Food was lackluster and the menu has become boring and bland.

Menu was pretty plain and simple and everyone in my party seemed to enjoy their nice, standard food.  The fries were fresh and tasty - to my personal disgust, I ate them all.

I, however, was very surprised when I had my lemon chicken.  It was very tasty, and it had a ton of flavors and ingredients that I would not have expected in a place like this - ex. tzatziki, hummus, cracked wheat. 

Extra points for surprising me!"

Its old and outdated and their food isnt great. Had a waitress once that was a nightmare and very rude. I believe that&#39;s when I stopped coming here. My company has held meetings here in their meeting rooms - OLD AND OUTDATED. Almost has a cigar smoke smell to it...I dont know. I cant stand this place anymore. Its really hit or miss and I got tired of missing. They did have a nice outdoor area when I came here for drinks."

They just make it too hard.  I made an Open Table reservation for 6:15 on a Sunday night.  They were not crowded yet it took a good five minutes to be seated.  The host just plain seemed lost.  He asked if we would like a wine list.  My wife said she did.  Yet no wine list ever arrived.  We had to ask three times for children&#39;s menus.  I had the NY Strip and my wife had the grilled jumbo shrimp.  Both were very good.  My eldest had the children&#39;s chicken strips.  The child portion was large and he liked it.  My youngest ordered noodles with butter sauce and cheese. When they came, no butter, no parm.  Not to worry, our waitress provided the same butter they use for rolls and we got to melt it ourselves on the noodles.  Aside from that, our service was good but not great.  This was our second attempt at Millrose, I doubt there will be a third.  It is really a shame because the food is pretty good."

Foremost, they are NOT a brewery, a fact which would have deterred me from purchasing the gift certificate to begin with.    

Given my apprehensions, the food was better than I expected, but still decidedly NOT very good, especially at this price.  Sampled fare was a smoked pork chop special and the burger.  Given it&#39;s origin in meat-packing, I was kind of surprised that the burger was as flat as it was.  The smoked pork chop was juicy and flavorful, but that burger was just sad (in addition to not being cooked as requested).

On the other hand, the space (especially the bar)  was well decorated with autumnal stuff and they feature other microbrews on the menu, just not their own.  I might consider it a place for a big event.

If I lived in the area and didn&#39;t have other actual breweries or places for great meat / ambiance I would go back.  But for now I consider it to be a case of bate &amp; switch :("
millrose-south-barrington,Bill G.,EYJ7QoGr8sQxc8G7QaH2AQ,"Elk Grove Village, IL",0,1,0,0,10,SI9fROvew5TqXGY-Ls4ZXA,1.0,2011-06-16,"I agree with Bill T and Brian&#39;s review . What happened to this place? This used to be a great spot to eat a few years back. We wanted a nice dinner after my son&#39;s graduation and I thought of Millrose.

 When I worked out this way, I&#39;d eaten here both for lunch and dinner. They had great food, a friendly busy bar and the place was packed. We get here on a Sunday late afternoon/early evening and there&#39;s nobody eating in the place. I had thought we might have had to wait for a table.

We get a meager paper type of menu and I don&#39;t even see the roast pork dinner that they were known for. The breadholder is cute and dainty but only held about 5 pieces of bread and there were six of us and hungry, so as we ordered drinks and appetizers I asked for  more bread when he bought the drinks. My ex-wife also asked him for bread as well, not having heard me ask....she&#39;s learned to tune me out long ago. Anyway, back he comes with the drinks - no bread. I asked him about it and he replied. &#34;Oh, you&#39;d like more bread?&#34; Now the kid was nice, but he wasn&#39;t very competent. Besides that he was giving each person the others drink. It happens sometimes, but not a great sign.

 The calamari appetizer was good but tiny. We had some kind of chorizo taco thing which was actually bland. How do you make chorizo bland?
I saw that they offered prime rib blackened which I&#39;ve had at other places, and it can be very good. When it came, it was a flat piece of shoe leather. I&#39;m serious now. If someone told me that they had accidentally cooked their shoe and put it on my plate I would have believed it. I asked for it medium rare and it was well well well done - toast. He explained that it was due to me ordering it blackened. Apparently th chef didn&#39;t study in Paris, as I explained the process. Honestly, I&#39;m 59 years old and that;s the first time I remember sending a dish back immediately. To their credit, they brought me out a new one (unblackened per my new request) in like two minutes. It was satisfactory. My daughter asked that the giardanera for her spicy chicken sandwich be on the side, but nope. It was plopped right on it. My son and ex-wife said their chicken dinner was not bad except for the stuffing.

IMy son and I saw the pistachio cake with gelato dessert and we ordered it. My daughter had the carrot cake and enjoyed it, but neither me or my son could finish the cardboard that was our dessert. How do you screw up gelato? It tasted like they gave us a wax demo model.

My only thought after this was....very obviously different owners from what I remember. It was a huge disappointment on a special occasion. I prefer to write the kind reviews, but I hope to save some other poor soul from a bad evening."

I went there a lot when I was younger, but then my family stopped going.  We went, probably for the first time in 5 years, for old times sake for my mother&#39;s birthday.

I&#39;m probably still too angry to write a coherent review, so I will simply relay my experience.  Keep in mind this was early on a monday night and we were probably one of ten tables in the restaurant. 

The experience was as follows:
6:00: Arrive for reservation and our group of 6 is seated at a huge circular table that should have seated 10-12.
6:10 waitress takes drink orders, runs away before entrees can be ordered.
6:25  drinks come to the table, entrees are ordered
6:50 salad arrives
7:10 entrees arrive
7:50 waitress finally picks up and returns check

We were seated right outside of the kitchen door (yet another terrible choice given that we could have been seated anywhere in the restaurant) so I don&#39;t know where the waitress was hiding.  

This is why we had stopped coming before, and why I will never go again (if a manager read this review today and called me to offer a free repeat dinner I would decline).  Food was good, not great, and the ambiance was a pleasant upscale rustic.  So I had to give it more than 1 star.  But like I said, I&#39;m never going back, not even if they were giving it away for free."

The wife and daughter both got the pork tenderloin..now..a typical tenderloin weighs less than 1lb.,which means it came from a market weight(225lb) hog,and thus does NOT produce a medallion that is 4 inches in diameter.tenderloins that would are typically cut from sow or boar kill 3-4 year old animals!!! and THEY ARE TOUGH AS NAILS.this is what you&#39;re getting here.As for myself,i got the ribs. Same as the$10 special during the week i guess,but for double the price.small rack small side.I just dont know how anyone could like these.They were made the day before,baked,then baked again and who knows maybe 3 times,tasted old. The meat fell onto my plate as i picked them up. covered in an overly sweet wallpaper paste of a BBQ sauce.PATHETIC!! Made sweet baby rays seem bland.From top to bottom,this place needs someone with knowledge to purchase product,someone to design a menu,AND SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO COOK THE MENU!!!"

Took my son out after Graduation on a Sunday evening at 4:30pm and the place was dead! There were only 2 other groups. Our reservations were for 5pm. They had us wait so they could set us up at a different table since we were early. Not sure why when the place was empty. We only saw 2 other groups come in by the time we left.
So let&#39;s start with the seating, there were 8 of us. They put us at a long table that seated 10. One side was a booth type set up so those that were there had to get up and move all 4 of us to let the first one in , out! Not very accomodating for chatting.
The appetizers they brought to to the table, crudites, were dried out. The radishes looked like there were there for days, even brown around the edges. I didn&#39;t taste the bread.
Equally disappointing was the food. Not worth the higher end prices. I had parmesan crusted chicken. The meal came with soup or salad, I chose salad. Nothing to write home about. The garlic mashed potatoes were good however there portion was huge! The food order seemed to take way too long (we were there over 2 hours). I will say there menu was not impressive. Maybe thats why it took us so long, everyone was trying to decide what to have since it consisted of a legal sized one sided menu. 
The service was no overly great, average I would say. Had it not been for the saving grace of a $75 gift card, I would have been angry. My son was not thrilled either. 
Definitely will not be coming back here."

We were seated by the large windows that lead to the outdoor seating. At first I was hesitant to sit by the windows because it was cold, but, it was snowing those huge beautiful snow clusters that slowly drift down... it really added to the overall ambiance and I&#39;m glad I had the view.

I went here with my husband and my 3 sons, along with my parents. We enjoyed the decor and our waitress was friendly, however, there were alot of things that turned me off about this place. First off- the rest rooms are located right off of a main hallway that leads to where our table was. The entire time we were there, there was a STRONG odor of poop wafting through the hallway. It was absolutely disgusting. When I got up to actually use the bathroom, it was so intensely awful smelling that it reminded me of a very full cat&#39;s litter box that had been left I scooped for too long.  The food was not very good at all. Not horrible, but nothing special. The beer that they brought out in tasting glasses from their brewery was not very flavorful. A few were like a stronger version of a miller lite. All of them tasted like mildew. My husband thought that perhaps they weren&#39;t cleaning out the lines often enough. Either way, gross. This place is huge. It seems to go on forever and there is ample seating for hundreds of people. So here is what really sealed the deal and ensured that we would never return again. As we were getting ready to leave, a hostess (I&#39;m assuming that was her job title) approached our table and said, &#34;Hi, I don&#39;t usually do this but we&#39;ve had a group of people waiting for about half an hour now for this table&#34;. Are you kidding me. The place was empty! There were at least 60 other tables that these people could have been seated at. Not to mention, we werent even there for that long! It wasnt lkle we were hanging around for hours. I was in total shock. We left and vowed to never return again. So avoid the mediocre food, crappy tasteless beer, shit fumes wafting across your table and beyond rude service..... Go somewhere else. Anywhere else. Haha."

Martinis came and I thought they had brought us doubles by mistake...big!
Wine list had decent selections. Seemed like the less expensive wines were marked up higher than more expensive ones. Some good values at higher end if you want a nicer wine. Coppola Rose was  wonderful dry Rhone style rose with our mussels.
We had no beer at the brewery.
The food:
Seafood chowder was nicely seasoned and not starched into sludge. But seafood was overcooked and chewy. Their version of Caesar salad wasn&#39;t so great. Canned artichoke hearts and seasoning of tomatoes didn&#39;t go well with the ordinary Caesar dressing.
Special was Prince Edward Island mussels. Outstanding! Tender, sweet mussels in herbal broth with scallions. The base of tomatoes and bread, my wife and I split over...she loved and I liked but thought it was a some unneeded flavors.
Pistachio gelato tart(?) was marvelous. Tons of pistachios on gelato with right amount of chocolate in graham cracker -like crunchy crust. Much better than I&#39;ve described.
Enjoyable dining with a couple weak spots."

They&#39;ve closed down their outdoor bar (pity, it used to be a lot of fun!). Their &#34;re-configured&#34; bar/banquet hall area is terrible--dark, enclosed, feels unfriendly.

For many years, Millrose used to be one of our weekly spots for lunch, and for the occasional after work cocktail. After some management changes a couple of years ago, their food declined to sub-standard, their menu shrank, and their service was appalling. So, we vowed to never again step inside... Fast forward to today, Thought, &#34;well, it&#39;s been a couple of years, let&#39;s give Millrose another try...&#34; Here&#39;s the story of that experience:

It was 75 degrees outside, preferred to sit outside anyway, so we moved from the bar to the &#34;restaurant&#34; section to be seated alfresco. They did not honor their 1/2-priced appetizer special--apparently their &#34;computers&#34; were not programmed that way... Manager was a clown. Decent and attentive waitress service (until the end). Ironically, my friend tried to pay with credit card, but after a long wait and mounting attitude from the servers, we ended up going to the bar to pay with cash and then move on to the next establishment for dinner.

We did enjoy a 1/2-priced bottle of wine from their expensive wine list. The $28 dollar Pinot Noir was had for $14 (which usually retails for less than $12, so no favors, there).

There are many great restaurants in Chicagoland--this is not one of them. Save your bucks and go somewhere else!

Once home for the evening and knowing that their manager was not interested in our lack-luster experience, tried to send upper-management my comments directly from their website; I guess  the &#34;contact us&#34; page was also not interested in hearing our story as it was giving error messages!"

It turned out to be a good venue for this kind of thing. Although the room we were in was dark, it had a warm and rustic feeling. The service was unnoticed (which is just how it should be at an event - not intrusive, but available and you rarely have to ask for anything). The food was above average for this kind of thing. Tender chicken with a nice gravy, great roasted veggies and fresh mashed potatoes. Great cheesecake as dessert. 
Not amazing, but couldn&#39;t find significant fault with anything."

       Wow, Right! I Can certainly be found in bulldogs on a tuesday feasting on amounts of wings that were meant to feed an army, and $3 jack mixers, NOW THATS WHATS UP! A solid second choice At this fine establishment is the Memphis sandwich, the memphis is a bbq pulled pork sandwich which features the usual LTOP (lettuce,tomato,onion,pickle) exquisitely golden onion rings which are battered to perfection, exploding like tiny flavor crystals of sweet deliciousness in your mouth with an initial crisp of perfection in each bite, topped with cheddar cheese as well.  As you dine,drink,watch the game, and socialize at bulldogs you could ask for a man could life get any better than this? Well my fellow diners it can, Bulldogs offers a pool table, a juke box so you can hear a music selection of your own preference, and last but not least gaming (video gambling). The staff at bulldogs is always friendly and accommodating with smiles on there faces adding to the over all up beat vibe this over grown man cave has to offer its patrons. Bulldogs also features an outdoor patio where smokers can gather in peace without harass and enjoy a cigarette after a beer, HAS THIS PLACE NOT THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING!?
 
The Bad

       To be completely honest there is not much bad i can say about this establishment that isn&#39;t in the realm of personal preference the only complaint i can make is that the noise level in bulldogs can get a bit obnoxious but on a game day with high energy passionate fans filling bulldogs from wall to wall that is to be expected and at times even enjoyable and enthralling.


So in Conclusion

        In this critics opinion bull dogs is not just worth a visit, but bulldogs is a fine establishment worthy of yours and my business, Before i leave you to your dining i would just like to note that THE ONLY THING holding bulldogs back from a five star rating is that it is not a white tablecloth establishment, which i reserve 5 star ratings exclusively for. SO YES YAY I&#39;M A FAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS WITHOUT BEING A WHITE TABLECLOTH ESTABLISHMENT!"

Time of my visit: Within lunch period

So I have decided to come here for lunch, today.  Most of lunch trips, I try to keep closer to work, so I don&#39;t waste too much time traveling.  The place was spacious inside.  I was seated immediately and my waitress came by shortly and promptly.

I ordered an ice tea and asked for recommendations.  She suggested chicken fingers, wings and some other dish, but I stopped at wings, I was sold!  I asked for 10 wings (5 sweet BBQ and 5 medium Buffalo) drumsticks only (yet again, I was told they couldn&#39;t guarantee drumsticks only, but my waitress promised she would try) and a side order of fries.

My came out very fast.  Fries were nothing special, just about what you&#39;d expect anywhere else.  Then I started on my wings.  I was not expecting them to be that good.  Medium Buffalo was not over spicy, nor too weak, sweet BBQ was not too sweet, like you would normally expect with honey BBQ.  But here is where the best part comes in, the way they fried the wings, the skin was crispy, but the inside was tender.  I thought it was awesome!  And in case anyone wonders, the waitress kept her promise, my order did look like she genuinely tried to make it all drumsticks.

Here was another tell-tell for me, the service was exceptional!  My waitress checked in on me periodically, brought out my ice tea refill without me asking!  Great service!  It was a little chilly inside, but I managed.  Overall a solid A!"

I get that if you want both ranch and blue cheese, but for ANY sauce at all? Come on! At least one should come with the wings.

Also not happy they decided to stop offering tator tots on the menu. Like it was that hard to keep them?

Located about mile from my hotel I decided it would be a good walk round trip to this joint. My walk there built up my thirst, and my walk home was trying to burn off monster beer and burger belly!
Ordered the alehouse burger medium well...burger was perfectly prepared and topped with a spicy BBQ sauce, onion straws, onions, and the other standard accoutrements! I tried the sweet potato fries which was a $2 up charge. They were average.
Sunday beer specials are 32oz domestics...which are aplenty! I chose the Leine&#39;s grapefruit shandy and did the best I could for a school night...

Staff was a bit impersonal and lacked attention. Ambiance is draft house and prices are in line with expectation.... I&#39;ll give this another shot if I&#39;m back in town, but at first visit this joint does not make the list...."

I came in for the all you can eat wings and was pleasantly surprised. Wings were super hot and tasted very fresh. Sauces were decent too.  I enjoyed the garlic parm the best.

Got the pot pie, which is just a hot can of Campbell&#39;s cream of onion soup on a thin thin layer of uncooked dough. Aaand the chicken and waffles was so dry and unflavorful it tasted as though a dementor had sucked the life out of it. Atmosphere was nice, very nice outdoor space, but the indoor space was kind of gross and floor was sticky. Waitress acted like she has no idea.

Every bar seat and every other table was occupied, it was as if the entire city of Carol Stream came out on this Thursday night to...well, it was either to apparently watch the Bulls game, or because there aren&#39;t many other options in the area.  Oh, and Thursdays are $2 pint night.

I grew up in the area, and there weren&#39;t many options back then.  Obviously, much hasn&#39;t changed.  Bulldogs is a breath of fresh air in comparison to the still sparse options of chain restaurants and craphole sports bars.

But beware - the mood changes at Bulldogs around 9-10pm.  Earlier in the evening, I was one of the younger people here.  When I left, I was one of the oldest.  The later it got, the pulsating music was cranked louder, as if they were transitioning into a dance club.  But nobody was dancing.  Ugh - identity crisis!

The beer list is respectable; I honestly didn&#39;t expect much from Bulldogs, and I&#39;m not sure why.  I went with a Green Line, I&#39;m not sure what my friend was drinking, but there are enough options on draft or in bottles to satisfy even the pickiest beer snob.

I wasn&#39;t super hungry, so I thought I&#39;d just order an appetizer.  I had the pretzels with cheese, which turned out to be EIGHT quite large pretzels.  My friend had a burger, which was massive, and ordered a dessert which was big enough to serve 4, at least.  The pretzels were good.

Bulldog is a welcome option in an area that doesn&#39;t offer much, but it&#39;s not a destination."

The place is very big &amp; even bigger than it looks.  When you walk in they have a large bar area &amp; tables around the bar.  However if you don&#39;t want to sit by the bar they have an area to the back with regular tables &amp; booths.  The area around the bar is filled with flat screen tv&#39;s.  This place has a huge menu of food &amp; their beer selection almost seems limitless.  

The staff here has always been friendly &amp; the service has always been fast.  My favorite dish that they have here would have to be the shrimp po boy &amp; in second definitely the shrimp macaroni &amp; cheese.  

This place also has a digital jukebox &amp; a few video poker &amp; video slot machines.  Besides the favorites that I listed they also have some delicious appetizer platters.  The potato skins are pretty good &amp; so are the buffalo wings.  They can put a few high top tables together which works very good especially if you have a large group.

After receiving our drinks and waiting another 5 minutes, we finally ordered our entrees. Once the entrees came (I ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich), they were mediocre at best. The shrimp on my sandwich tasted like it was frozen shrimp that got put in a store bought breading with no spices and then deep-fried. The rest of my group thought their entrees were just okay.

Hubby allergic so we called manager Josh, and he proceeded to apologize and got us a new burger and took care of bill &amp; gave us gift card for dinner on him.

They have a huge menu of different types of bar foods. They have specials everyday, too. I know Mondays are dollar burgers, and Wednesdays, the night I was there, they feature 1/2 price pizza.

My mother ordered 5 boneless bbq wings and a side salad, and my sister ordered the El camino burger (a Mexican themed burger with tortilla Strips, bacon, cheese, sour cream, etc.) with waffle fries. They have plenty of sides options, and like I said, a huge bar menu.

Bulldogs is a cool place. They offer specials every night and the atmosphere is laid back. There is a bar section and a restaurant section, but you can order food and drinks at both, obviously.

There are plenty of tables and the atmosphere is nice. It was dimly lit in the dining room, which is standard of course. The bar probably gets rowdy, as everyone one does, when there&#39;s a major sporting event of any type, but there was nothing big on TV that night. I will note there are plenty of TVs in the venue too.

The service was okay; our servers weren&#39;t on the same page (one was a trainee) and they kept coming back and asking the same things and actually forgetting simple requests. Oh well, maybe just an off night.

I won&#39;t go out of my way to get bulldogs, but it&#39;s a nice place to have as an option in Carol Stream. A solid 3 star joint!"

The waitress, Kristina, was very kinda and attentive. The kitchen messed up our appetizer order and she took care of it almost instantly. 

The food was outstanding overall. Huge menu to benefit most people! I also liked that the servings were not abnormally large but a nice meal that didn&#39;t leave me feeling gross or food coma-like. 

My Dad had a burger, Mom had the pot roast sandwich and I had the southwest panini. We were all VERY satisfied with our meal. 

Drinks, Food, Service, Ambiance... all great!

What did it for me was their beautiful patio area with a fire pit!! Perfect for summer nights. They have darts, pool, and video games. It&#39;s lively, large, inexpensive and fun. Can&#39;t go wrong. Next time I&#39;ll try the food. :)"

It&#39;s notoriously bad - you frequently have to track down your waitress and it can take forever to get a drink. They also added video poker recently which is a huge turnoff for me.

When we got here we ordered Queso Dip and Buffalo Wings instead, because I DO WHAT I WANT, YO. Also, Pregnancy cravings change at a moment&#39;s notice, because your body is your enemy.

The queso dip is filled with lies. There is no cheese and salsa mixture, it&#39;s cheese and also cheese. I&#39;m thinking next time if I order it ( which is pretty unlikely), I&#39;ll just get a cup of the chili and mix it in. There are no rules in outlaw food. 

For the wings we ordered 3 different sauces - Cajun, Sweet Chili, and Inferno Buffalo. 

The cajun sauce didn&#39;t really taste like anything at all. The Inferno buffalo had some heat. The majority of the time when a place has &#39;inferno wings&#39;, they&#39;re usually pretty tame. These had a good level of heat. The Sweet Chili sauce was awesome. I would definitely get the wings in that sauce again, it was the favorite of both the man and I.

Afterwards I ordered an Ultimate Grilled Cheese, it comes with a couple of different cheeses and some bacon. How could that possibly go wrong, right?

They bring my grilled cheese out, cut in half, and the cheese is very obviously not melted whatsoever. So whomever made it, cut it and looked at it and said &#39; Yeah, that looks about right!&#39;

Now, i&#39;m not a cooking expert,  there&#39;s a lot of stuff I can&#39;t make, but a grilled cheese is a relatively easy thing to master. Slap cheese between two slices of bread, heat until melted - BAM! 

A couple reviews had referenced the waitresses walking around in outfits similar to Tilted Kilt, but all of the waitresses I saw were in either normal-sized t-shirts or jerseys, and they all had jean shorts. There was nary an ass cheek in sight. 

I&#39;d go back for wings, I loved the sweet chili sauce. It&#39;s what&#39;s saving this from being a 2 star review. I&#39;d probably just avoid the rest of the menu besides the appetizers. If you mess up a grilled cheese, i&#39;m not going to feel adventurous enough to try out the rest of the menu."

Beer:  They&#39;ve got everything from trash to treasure.  The treasure end doesn&#39;t have as many choices, but there&#39;s some good ones on there to choose from.  Plus, we came on $3 draft night so it was cheap too.

Food:  Not bad.  I got a burger and it was cooked perfectly and loaded with toppings.  Just the way I like it.  It seems like there are awesome deals in this department as well...although I passed up the 1/2 price pizza.

Service:  We had an awesome server but I can guess it&#39;s not always that way in the bar judging from the looks of people around us.  This one&#39;s a draw.  I guess you can always sit on the restaurant side if you&#39;re really worried about it...though I can&#39;t vouch for it.

Atmosphere:  The place looks nice, it&#39;s pretty big, and there are two sides to choose from.  If you want sports bar, you&#39;ve got a side with a bar, tables, pool tables, darts, blah blah blah, and if you want restaurant, they&#39;ve got a side for that too.  The clientele on the bar side is a little annoying (as is the crappy music they play all night on the jukebox) but if you don&#39;t mind screaming over said crappy music at the people around you, then you&#39;re alright here.  Obviously, it gets louder and more annoying as the night gets later, but maybe I&#39;m just old and crochety.  Bah humbug."

How can you beat $2 ANY DRAFT pints on Thursdays? (They have 32 beers on draft) Or $3 U-Call-It&#39;s on Wednesdays? 

On the other thand, the service is horrible. I have been there several times since moving back into the area a few months ago, especially after learning about their Thursday night draft special. When I have sat at the bar, I have struggled to be served by the bartenders even when it wasn&#39;t very busy. The bartenders would just randomly disappear for 10 minutes. When I have gone to Bulldog with my fiance and had a meal at a table in the bar, we have consistently had to wait for service. We have finished our drinks and wanted another, and had to wait forever for our server to come back. By then we normally pay our bill and go.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I really don&#39;t mind the place. If the service was even average this place would have easily earned 4 stars from me. But the service really has proven to be sub-par over many visits. I still go there every other week for a good beer on the cheap. Also, the food is average- I would never go there for a meal by itself but I definitely order food after having a few.

I recommend checking out their website, looking at their specials, and checking it out on a night that suits your tastes."

Recommend to: not even my worst enemies.

I really do not get it.  Bulldog Ale House took over Buds, in Roselle, and turned it into a place you want to be. Lively, dare a I say a bit upscale and with a wonderful beer selection.  When it came time to entertain some family from out of town, I suggested this location, as it is a bit closer to my house. 

What was I thinking??

First, good luck trying to find your way in.  There are half a dozen doors, and they are not marked, and tinted.  Some extremely smart people I met up had the same comment, of not being able to find their way in.  Matter of fact, I went to the same door that I came in on, and 3 of us wrestled with it, to get our way out ....ugh.

Second, we all felt guilty taking up our servers time, as she clearly had better things to do, than to provide service.

Third, they must have caught a Denny&#39;s-going-out-of-business sale to furnish this dump.

Fourth, the food was drab, they got orders wrong, twice, pizza is laughably overprices for being so mundane (the large and medium are the same size, but priced differently).

Fifth, you will not find the awesome beer selection here, that you might find in Rosellle.  There was only one beer that I found to be drinkable, but nothing else ...yawn.  Ale house?  How about Bud Light house....

Sixth, they went to the slutty Scottish whore store to get the servers uniforms, which seem out of place at a Denny&#39;s. (yeah I do not go to Tilted Kilt either)

Seventh, I cannot tell you how embarrassed I was to suggest this place.  How could they have gotten one place so right, then the other so wrong???"

Service:
I have been here twice and have been disappointed twice. Waitresses here seem to not give a damn about doing a good job. I been here on a moderately busy day and didn&#39;t get my order until about an hour and a half later. It was All You Can Eat Wings Day.... My final time, service was still bad and our order took close to an hour to come out. How much time does it take to cook up 10 wings? You shouldn&#39;t have to walk up to someone else to get refills on drinks either. Friendliness is lacking from the waitresses as well. You are supposed to be having a good time at a bar! Not getting frustrated over serving yourself.

Food:
Probably the least exciting food I have had in awhile. Fries were lukewarm and not very flavorful even with Ketchup. And the All You Can Eat Wings might as well be All You Can Eat Bland. Every sauce I tried from their limited selection was very lackluster. It always ended up just tasting like the blandness of the chicken meat. At least the food didn&#39;t make me sick. I don&#39;t want to bother with trying other options considering the service.

Atmosphere: 
Not my sort of crowd. Literally all the creepers and dropouts from my High School go here. As biased as that sounds, I am not even the least bit exaggerating. Place feels devoid of the typical sports fans or young people. You go here if you were part of the awkward social outcasts or you&#39;re over 40 in the lonely suburbs. This isn&#39;t Bulldogs fault by any means, but be warned. I highly doubt you will find your one true lover or best friend here. Unless you are the type who excessively swears and talks about sticking it to the man as a hobby. 

This place depresses me and felt like it sucked away a bit of my youth. The food, the crowd, and the service all tell me never to return."

Had read mostly good reviews, so decided to give Bulldog a try. Mostly positive; excellent service at the bar; good beer selection. It was &#34;all you can eat&#34; wings night, so I tried both Spicy Garlic (pretty good) and Caribbean Jerk (okay).  Stomach woke me up about 4 am, can&#39;t pinpoint the wings, (I didn&#39;t have THAT many) but I&#39;ll probably skip them if I visit again. Lots of TV&#39;s, but not the channel selection of other sports bars. If you want to watch a national channel or a local Chicago team, it&#39;s a good spot."

The tap list consisted of 31 beers tonight with 11 of them being craft beers. The rest of then were your typical Bud, Miller, Coors fare. That&#39;s fine if that&#39;s what you are looking for, but a self-proclaimed ale house should hold itself to a higher standard.

I had their wrap and an appetizer which was fine if just typical sports bar food. Service from the wait staff was good, with only one bartender appearing to be a bit annoyed. I don&#39;t see why as the place was maybe half capacity.

It&#39;s not what I was expecting, and I&#39;d likely not come back.

I tipped generously, knowing it was going to be the last time they would see me."

We started with the mini corndogs which were fresh out of the oven, but nothing special. Ordered the wings and didn&#39;t like them much. Got three different flavors, none of which I really liked, and they were not hot coming out of the kitchen. The ribs didn&#39;t taste very good and the bbq sauce didn&#39;t even cover the whole slab. The popcorn shrimp tasted fine but much better could be found elsewhere. The seasoned fries were cooked well, but lacked seasoning. For dessert, we ordered the apple crumble a la mode. That was actually pretty good even though the ice cream melted too fast. 

Overall, the service was really slow and our waitress didn&#39;t smile.  For our first time there, it wasn&#39;t really impressive. We probably won&#39;t be going back anytime soon unless we get another coupon."

Turned out we made a bad decision going to Bulldog Ale House. While the beer selection was OK, everything else about our experience was fair to bad. Drink orders were frequently screwed up, the food was bland at best and service was terrible. For example, someone in our group ordered a personal cheese pizza and got a meat lovers pizza instead. They apologized and brought out the correct pizza but it was drastically undercooked and inedible. Despite the plethora of mistakes, the manager was only willing to comp the pizza, saying, &#34;that&#39;s all I can do.&#34; No, dude, you can do more.

Watch out Flip Flops, there&#39;s another bar on the strip.

Grand opening was on Feb 25, which I missed but heard they packed the house.  I came during the week to check out their happy hour menu that they advertised online.  The waitress didn&#39;t even offer me their specials and I had to ask for it.  Even then, she didn&#39;t really know what they offered for happy hour.  They also offer daily specials, which is included in the menu.  The $1 burgers on Monday sounds like a good deal!

The inside is very nicely decorated, spacious and clean.  They have both a dining area and a bar area.  There were 2 pool tables and some arcade games near the bar area.  The Ale House burger I ordered was tasty and came with a side of my choice, which was crinkled cut fries.

Service was the only downside to this place, but perhaps it&#39;ll get better once they get into the swing of things."

We called ahead to ask if we could make a reservation for 10 people around 6pm, they said don&#39;t worry about it you&#39;ll be fine....fast forward 1 hr 15 mins we finally get a seat.  My friend tells the host/manager ? not sure who she was that she should get a free shot since it&#39;s her birthday and since we had to wait, the girl says Sure...but how about ALL your friends buy one and then I&#39;ll give you a free shot. Um, right. 

So, we order our food and it takes quite a while to come out and once it does 4 out of 5 of the people on my side of the table&#39;s orders were messed up- no chili on the fries, no sauce on the wrap, wrong sauce, NO sauce and I got 8 wings and a bonless one when I ordered 10 wings.  YIKES, not sure about how the other half of the table&#39;s came out.  One plus is when we pointed out the wing situation the girl we told did bring me a free beer. 

When we were wrapping up, tons of people kept coming to the table trying to get us to leave...but at the same time to buy more stuff.  We had planned to stay the night there, but after all that decided we were done.  I have no plans to frequent this establishment again. Get it together Bulldog!"

They had a bloody Mary special for $5 on Sunday, which was tasty. My only complaint was that the bloody Mary should have a pickle spear, instead of a pickle slice. Always a spear, people!

I spent Mother&#39;s Day here (sans mother, but with my brother and my wife) checking the place out.

In a sense, Bulldog is sort of a Tilted Kilt knockoff, but with short shorts or green skirts and less in-your-face cleavage. I got a Bulldog Burger, which has bacon, mushrooms, cheese, and possibly lettuce and tomato. It alleged to come with a bleu cheese sauce and hot sauce, but I don&#39;t remember the burger being hot or getting bleu cheese on the side. I did get onion rings, which were nice and crispy.

The burger itself was well cooked, and the bacon was a nice touch. It had a nice hint of charcoal, too. It&#39;s not the best burger in town, but I don&#39;t regret getting it.

My wife had a ham and pineapple pizza, which was every bit the definition of average. Thick, chewy crust, canned pineapple, ham of unknown origin with unassuming tomato sauce and cheese... it&#39;s not terrible, there just isn&#39;t anything &#34;signature&#34; about it.

My brother had fish tacos, which I didn&#39;t try, but the spiced mayo that went with it was quite good; something I wish I&#39;d gotten with my onion rings.

Overall, I&#39;d probably try this place again. Maybe I&#39;ll make a run at the nachos or wings next time, though."

I just think that the staff needs to work on their personalities and this place would be much better.

If you want to watch some sports this is a good place to go! They have a lot of TV&#39;s all around to watch and the prices don&#39;t seem too absurd to me.

Read this review based solely on Thursday night specials however, since those are the nights I go to Bulldog Ale House.

Thursdays are awesome because it&#39;s $2 pint night! Any beer (or beer combination) is only $2! By beer combination I mean one of my favorite beers, the Black and Blue (half Blue Moon, half Guiness). Their boneless hot wings aren&#39;t half bad neither, and their kitchen is open fairly late.

Service here is not too bad, but, as mentioned before, this is based on Thursday nights, which are super busy. If you wish to find seating for your party, I suggest you show up a little early, although there is plenty of seating.

I parked in the lot and thought I had scored a pretty good spot because it was right next to the patio.  Then I realized that the door is on the other side.  The walk didn&#39;t kill me, but I was puzzled for a second.

When I entered I was surprised to see that this was another bar with girls wearing short plaid skirts.  I had been to Tilted Kilt and was not particularly impressed.  I did not think my chances for good beer were good.  Girls hired for their looks and willingness to wear short skirts are not typically about the beer.  Don&#39;t get me wrong... I like pretty waitresses, but good service is still the most important thing

This place is big.  I was seated in an area just beyond the hostess station, and there were tables in all directions.  I didn&#39;t feel overly crowded.  There were far too many TVs, with one on practically every surface.  I guess people like that.  I don&#39;t.

There was no beer menu on the table, but I didn&#39;t know whether there was supposed to be one or not.  When the waitress stopped by, I asked what they had on tap with a preferance for something besides BMC.  She then realized I had no tap list and retrieved one from another table.  Leaving me to look it over, I noticed that there were indeed a few possibilities.  Rogue Dead Guy caught my eye for one.  There were also listings simply stating &#34;Goose Island&#34;  and &#34;Leinenkugel &#34;.  As soon as I started asking the waitress for some details on these selections, I realized that she knew nothing about beer.  Looking around at the other patrons, I noticed a lot of Bud Light.  What a shame.
So long story short, the Bulldog does have a few good beers on tap at a reasonable price per pint.  I sampled a few and despite being served in a Miller Lite glass, I don&#39;t have any real complaints about the beer.

I ordered some food.  It was typical bar food.  Nothing that stood out for me.  It wasn&#39;t great, it wasn&#39;t bad.

The service was fair.  Our waitress did not really seem to be trying.  She wasn&#39;t rude, but just because you are wearing a cute little outfit doesn&#39;t mean you can skip the personality.  In fact, I think it may even set the expectation that you are an outgoing person that may even like your job a little.  Sell the fantasy a little or go work at Denny&#39;s.  At least there I expect the waitresses to be wishing for death.

So overall, The Bulldog Ale House was big, clean and had some good brews.  The sports bar atmosphere was not quite my style and the pretty girls are a nice gimmick but not enough to make me rave about this place.  I might stop in again if I was in the area, but I wouldn&#39;t make this a destination."

Yes, they have the same menu, but the service here was amazing, and that is really important to me.  Lately, it seems as if service has gone downhill lately, and Bulldog Ale House goes above and beyond.

First of all, it was $1 burger night.  Yes, a $1 for a 1/4 lb burger.  AWESOME!  Mind you, it&#39;s not Kobe beef or anything, but it definitely gets the job done!!  We also ordered nachos, salad, fries (crinkle and seasoned) and the brownie bottom pie dessert.

All of the food was good!!  Especially the dessert (they were out of the apple dessert I wanted, though, so that was kind of sad, but the brownie made an acceptable substitute!).  The only strange part was that the nachos came out, and then our salads came out WITH the food.  So you were compelled to eat the salad while the fries got cold.  So that was a little strange.

Our server&#39;s name was Jordan, and she was SUCH a sweetheart!  Very attentive and friendly.  And a dirty dish never sat on our table for more than 10 seconds before it was whisked away, even if it was by the manager.  The manager was even very attentive--she was checking up on things, making sure the meal was good, etc.  You could tell she cared about the restaurant!

I will definitely be returning soon!!"

Time of my visit: Lunch

Well, I think, I have reviewed all, but one place in that strip.  I could not decide on what I wanted to have, so I figured I would go for a burger.

Well, I arrived, I was told to sit anywhere and the waitress came by promptly.  I have asked about the special and her recommendations.  She told me the burger were pretty good, especially chicken burger, any other day, I would have opted for that, but I had chicken yesterday and was not in the mood for it.  So ended up ordering Hawaiian Burger (it came with a pineapple on top and a side of BBQ sauce), I was sold.  I took homemade chips instead of fries.

Both my water and food arrived quickly.  Let me breakdown the chips first...  They were pretty good!  There were not stale (which is a case with a lot of place), nor oily (again a case with a lot of place), pretty good!  Now, on to the burger...  Oh boy...  Disappointing...  First, a piece of advise, when you offer pineapple on a burger, ring form is usually better than chopped...  Second, I get it&#39;s pricey to keep fresh pineapples in stock, but I can tell a difference between a shitty canned pineapple (which it was) vs. fresh pineapple...  The pineapple took away from the taste of the burger, which was not all that bad.  It was not anything over the top, but about what you&#39;d accept from a bar burger.

The service was a bit inadequate as well, but friendly.  Barkeep was nice and either had a lot on her plate with the bar or was just short staffed, never had my water refilled, until I asked for a refill with my check.  I ended up going up to the bar to pay my check.

Overall a C-, could have been worse, chips and barkeep friendliness kept it from falling further down."

We walked in around 7:30 pm and there was maybe only about 5 people there. We sat at the bar and started looking at the drink menu. We were greeted almost immediately and since we weren&#39;t sure what we were having we asked for water. Bartender brings us the first and only waters of the night. Never refilled them, never asked if we wanted more, she just took our waters away after we finished. 
It was nice to see they have a variety of drinks and drink specials. My friend got the $3 Coronas and I had the $4 margarita, frozen. My rita didnt smell nor taste like one. I kept hoping it would get better so I ordered a total of 3. I really think the bartender made them virgin, no alcohol. 
The place was not busy but the bartender ignored us most of the time we were there. After we were done with drinks, rather than ask if we want another, she looked our way and went about her business, eating at the end of the bar! 
Not sure if the poor service was due to the fact that we aren&#39;t regulars, everyone else was waited on except us. A group of guys came in later and their beers were still kind of full and she was asking them if they were ready for another. My glass was completely empty, I pushed it away from me, she saw but didnt ask if I wanted another drink until like 10 min later. 
I will give them one more chance in the future and see if the service is better and I will NOT get the margaritas. The bar itself is ok, like that there is outdoor seating and its close to home. I  curious about the fruity drinks on the menu. 
Hopefully we miss last nights bartender who did nothing but stare us down, make weak drinks and stuff her face at the end of the bar."

Was miss charged for the garlic pretzel bites which were advertised as $3.99. Had a double burger for $2 which was well well well done (i guess you get what you pay for). my coworker found a piece of HARD Plastic in his burger! we were trying to have a value lunch yet my individual bill was $12!

Immediately, upon walking in, I felt as though I was at a tiki bar in the tropics! The décor and atmosphere is really fun! We sat indoors and had a wonderful view of the park across the street! It was not very crowded so you could hear every conversation from guests at the bar. Our waitress was nice but rather slow at greeting us or taking our order; however, she was also the only one working so we can&#39;t blame her. We got the pickle chips for an appetizer and they were excellent!! Our dad ordered the BLT wrap, my boyfriend got the burger with waffle fries on it, and I got the jerk chicken. Our food was okay, but nothing spectacular. The service was, again, friendly but extremely slow. I think having someone else step-in to help at the bar or delivering food would be a good idea when it gets busy and there&#39;s only one server.

Granted she was a new server but definitely not ready to help tables by herself. After taking order came back to table with random food questions. Also couldn&#39;t get a drink order straight. After multiple times getting things mixed up enough was enough already. Either she isn&#39;t met for the food service industry or poor training. Then made a comment like wow when I asked her not to remove two appetizers from our table. Over all the service was terrible.

The food is good.  We enjoyed the atmosphere when we went and the owners have always been nice.  The servers have been nice as well.  Two complaints with the place:  one: when you order food it seems to take a long time for your order to arrive and two: when they have music, it is almost always way too loud.  I think they may have fixed problem number one based on my recent experience.  My last order was almost delivered faster than I wanted.  I had an salad before my sandwich and the salad came very quickly and within a few minutes my sandwich was there too.  

Problem number two isn&#39;t a Flip Flops problem alone.  I get really tired of going to places to meet with friends and having to shout to make ourselves heard.  It might make some sense if the people in the place were dancing or something but everybody is sitting and trying to talk and these places seem intent on blasting out music.  I don&#39;t get that.  I recommend Flip Flops as a place to eat and hang out with friends.  You should try it."

We had a coupon so even though it was kind of a drive for us we wanted to give it a try. (And we saw they have fried pickles on the menu and we are big fans of fried pickles!) We went on a Wednesday night around 6:15. (It got a lot more crowded at 7:00 and on). 

This is a really cute place with a thatched hut bar and a beach-y wall mural. The bar is big and many people sat at it and ate and drank. They have high tables and low/regular tables. 

We were treated GREAT by Dion. She gave us excellent service and was down to earth and positive. We loved that they bring you free popcorn- that&#39;s a fun touch. 

The fried pickles were good- pickle chips- and a generous portion served with a side of ranch.

I ordered the bottomless soup and salad- it&#39;s $8.99. The salad came in a huge bowl and was way too much for me but very tasty- iceberg lettuce, carrots, radishes, green olives, hot peppers, and a delicious oil and vinegar dressing. I appreciated that it didn&#39;t have cheese on it. You can order any of their soups or chili and I was hoping to try several but the servings were so huge that I only tried two. I LOVED the chicken rice soup- it was creamy and comforting and tasted just as I hoped. I wish I lived or worked closer so I could order it regularly. I also tried the minestrone which Dion said is a favorite- it was also good but I was really too full to eat much of it. I think next time I&#39;ll see if the soup could be served in cups rather than bowls- then I could try their chicken noodle soup or chili too. The soups were impressive to me (although probably not what most people think of ordering at a place like this- I encourage you to try them!) 

My husband got a burger and thought it was pretty good but a little dry. The fries were on the thick side but he thought they were good. Next time he wants to try a wrap and the spicy chicken soup. 

They have a funnel cake fry dessert which sounded clever but we didn&#39;t try it. 

They seem to have a lot of food and drink specials here and also a lot of events. I bet this is a popular place for locals. I didn&#39;t feel like I was eating in a bar- rather a casual restaurant with great food. 

I have to say that I was struck with how clean the bathroom was! Spotless. 

I think there is a jukebox thing on the wall by the bar- I didn&#39;t try it but it&#39;s a cool addition. 

I was surprised to see that they had &#34;live video gaming&#34; in the restaurant- that kind of bummed me out as we left- seeing the gambling machines. I&#39;m a therapist so sometimes have strong opinions about things that I&#39;ve seen people struggle with. So I guess that&#39;s why I took one star off (and that my husband didn&#39;t love his burger). But for my food alone and the cute theme, free popcorn and Dion&#39;s great service I would have given Flip Flop&#39;s 5 stars."

They have good food AND DRINK specials everyday.  If you sit at the bar you can get a little bit of better service, because you&#39;re right in front of the bartender.  Some nights they are so busy that unfortunately it takes awhile for your order to be taken, but the servers at least acknowledge your presence.  

The boyfriend and I go here a lot for the hawks games, and they make the night very enjoyable with ALL the t.vs including the larger projector screen with the game on, and the audio.

The drink itself was pretty good (light and fruity) and surprisingly strong.  The popcorn helps curb my appetite while I waited for dinner.  The music plays too loudly.  The food is okay.  The  Caribbean-themed decor isn&#39;t as inviting as I would have thought.

The food at Flip Flops has been progressively getting better and more diverse which I love, however I still think that they are overpriced on their drinks. 

The fact they have never had weekend drink specials floors me. I worked at a bar for several years and that is the biggest day for specials, you have more of a draw, especially now with competition from Bulldog Ale House right across the street.

So food I would say 4 stars, Drinks prices 3 stars and the service 3 stars as well."

The first time I went with two friends on a Thursday evening and it was a great time.  Other than us, there were only about 4 or 5 other people there, all sitting up at the bar.  Our service was very quick and the waitress was very friendly and attentive.

After having such a good first experience, I took my girlfriend there.  It was the Friday before St. Patrick&#39;s Day, so we were expecting it to be pretty busy, simply because they do sell booze.  When we got there, it was filled with a lot of bigger parties, but we managed to find the last two-top open, near the entrance.  It took about 15 minutes before anyone came up to acknowledge us.  Once our waitress took the drink order, she was very fast at coming back with it, so that was nice.  But then, it was about another 20-30 minutes before anyone else walked past our table.  I had finished my beer in that time, so I actually walked up to the bar to get my second drink from the bartender, who was also busy, but doing a great job of managing all her bar patrons.

A gentleman, who I believe was a manager, came by the table and asked how things were.  He was the first person to come by us since our waitress had brought our drinks nearly a half an hour earlier.  We were able to place our food orders with him and he must have said something to our waitress because she was much more attentive after that.

To be fair to the waitress, from what I saw, there were only two servers, one bartender, one busser, and this manager working the entire front.  Being that the entire place was filled, they didn&#39;t do a bad job.  But I would hope that management would better prepare for the future.  Not sure if this was an unusually busy night that caught them off guard, but it&#39;s St. Patrick&#39;s Day weekend...you should expect to be pretty busy (even though you&#39;re not an Irish pub) and bring in extra staff to handle to high capacity.

The beer selection is pretty good.  The food, while creatively described on the menu, is nothing really special.  Not bad, but nothing I am craving the next day.  However, the prices are pretty decent."

My wife wasn&#39;t jumping for joy with the chicken sandwich either and the nachos were mediocre agreed to hit this place again after an afternoon of golf at Glendale Lakes but not for the dinner fare.

The drinks are horrible, they are ridiculously over priced, the bartenders are rude, the food sucks, it&#39;s constantly over crowded because they let too many people in at a time, and it&#39;s so loud in there you can&#39;t even think straight, let alone order a friggen drink!

It was an ok place to watch the game.  Fun atmosphere, but the service was subpar.

My friend and I sat down at the only available table left--score!  We picked out what we wanted to start off with to drink right away based on the specials posted above my friends&#39; head.  And then we waited...and waited...and waited some more.  Finally after about 20 minutes of no service, I went to the bar to order....and then I got ignored there for about 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, our waitress finally came over.  We ordered our drinks, and luckily, they came out very quickly.

We got the &#34;Jamaican Me Crazy&#34; rum bucket for $10.50 on special.  It was delicious and the run hit you HARD after that, so it was definitely a generous pour.  They know how to make a good drink here!

The food that we ordered (pretzel and fries) were typical bar food and did their best to soak up the alcohol!

The service is friendly and the food/drink isn&#39;t at the price of &#34;Suburban Rip-off&#34; just yet. This is a tiki-type place (bar is a gigantic grass hut) that has island inspired type menu and drinks available. I&#39;ve had the Friday fish fry and find worth a try. The Blue Moon outta the tap always kinds of tastes funny to me but let me know what you think. I found the pizza to be pretty tasty. 

Place gets a decent crowd in it for the area. Wednesday I believe is karaoke night and was a pretty good time. I saw one live act (I think they have a couple per week) that sang hits of old and new that I really liked. 

I haven&#39;t gotten really loaded here even though even its pretty close to my house, but it&#39;s on my list of to-do&#39;s."

Went here for the first time last night with my boyfriend. Being our first time we needed to look over the menu but were attacked by mamma meannie our waitress the second we sat down. When we didn&#39;t know our drink order her green tentacles were quickly extended and followed by the look of death. When she came back foaming at the mouth we decided we better order quickly or she was going to send us to the chamber of death. I ordered the cheese fries and my boyfriend ordered the jalapeno cheese stix for Appetizers. I must admit the jalapeno cheese stix were quite tasty and almost as hot as the fire that was breath out mamma meannie. The cheese fries were also good and had ample amounts of cheese. For dinner we each had an individual pizza. These pizzas are small. Seriously don&#39;t order this alone and expect to be full. My other complaint is getting a refill on a soft drink is harder then winning the marathon on two broken feet. If you have beer they are right on top of refills but if you have a softdrink better step aside. All in all the service here was the biggest let down. The food was ok and probably worth 3 starts but the service is some of the worst I have ever had. Should have checked Yelp before going here!!!

It was not crowded at all, but what do you expect for a Tuesday night.  Anyway, it should be more crowded.  The atmosphere is very nice and the food was delicious.  It is such a cute place, very festive and makes you want to go to the Caribbean - cute tiki bar inside.  They start you off with some complimentary popcorn, which we found to be a nice change of pace.  We ordered some sort of garlicy bread appetizer which the waitress recommended.  It was really good and the price was reasonable.  Kudos to her for that recommendation.  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad for $8.99.  The salad was huge - I couldn&#39;t eat it all.  For the soup I was given a choice of a cup or a bowl.  I chose a cup because I wanted to try several.  I started with the chili - it was quite good.  Unfortunately, after that I was full so I couldn&#39;t try the rest.   Also came with some fresh buttered breadsticks!  My husband ordered &#34;flippy&#39;s dinner salad&#34;  (name could be wrong) with added popcorn shrimp.  Again, the portion size was huge and he couldn&#39;t eat it all either.  They were extremely generous with the popcorn shrimp.  The service was great. This also  would be a nice place to watch a game.  They have quite a few tv&#39;s including a big screen.  They also have drink specials for the game and other specials as well, including a really good burger special.  There is an outdoor eating area too, away from the street which would be nice for lunch or dinner.  We often go to bulldogs, but this was a nice change of pace.  I often see coupons for this place - check it out!"

Their patio is great if you want to kick back and down a rum bucket (or two). The pizza is okay. Macaroni &amp; cheese bites are good when they actually cook them all the way. $10 for the rum bucket isn&#39;t a bad price. The projection screen tv inside would be better if it was actually a dark bar and you could see what was on the screen. They&#39;d be better off getting a flat screen. All in all not a bad little spot to grab some appetizers and a drink or two.

Mine was so delicious that I actually cleared my plate -- a rare event for me.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a lot of solid seasoning.  The bun was fresh and the fries were tasty.  

The wait staff was attentive and the bar was pretty busy -- not packed but definitely hopping.  It will be interesting to see how well the clientele holds up in the winter months."

For early on a Saturday night the place wasn&#39;t too packed but still had a decent sized crowd, with people streaming in all the time.  My GF and I sat ourselves to a table and quickly had someone come over and give us menus and get our drink orders in.  

The food &amp; drink prices weren&#39;t expensive, and were inline with what you&#39;d expect from such a place ($8-9 for a sandwich/burger).   I&#39;d have to say the service was really good &amp; friendly(maybe because it wasn&#39;t crazy crowded yet?) ... our waitress came over to our table several times to check up on us and see how everything was.  She even offered to reheat our appetizer after we had gotten our meals.  

We got the artichoke/spinach dip appetizer, which came with plenty of chips and a good amount of dip.   I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich - good, but a bit overwhelmed by the spicy sauce and my GF got the burger with pineapple, she liked it and normally she&#39;s a bit picky.

Negatives - I could see parking being a problem (but wasn&#39;t that night) and I&#39;m not a fan of the whole Jimmy Buffet thing, so music-wise I would put something else on the jukebox.

Will definitely give this place another visit!!"

Their opening was delayed by over two months but no explanation as to why. I hope they didn&#39;t miss the mark. 

I went last week on Monday night, hoping to beat the MNF crowd. I went with a large group and a few kids. We did get a table right away, but a roll of the eyes from the waitress when we asked to put two tables together. She did move it and her attitude did improve a little. We ordered a multitude of food, including burgers, kids meals for the little ones, some beer and milk for the kids. I also ordered some wings as appetizers. 

A few minutes later the waitress came back and apologized that they didn&#39;t have any milk, but they were running to get some, which was fine. That was one big plus for me. The owner/manager even came over and apologized which was a nice touch. Then it went downhill. The wings never came (I wasn&#39;t charged either so they were never ordered to begin with). My medium burger was charred, as was everyone else&#39;s. There was no ketchup to be found. They have those little 6 packs on the table to hold utensils and condiments and the three tables nearest didn&#39;t have any either. The waitress came back with one that was about 1/8th full. The milk did arrive safe and sound. 

I substituted onion rings for fries which were great. The men ordered the burger with BBQ sauce and &#34;onion rings&#34; on it but were sad to find out there was only one ring per burger. The men also complained that the TVs were too small and not enough of them for a football crowd on the weekends.

Overall, I was not impressed. I know they spent a lot of time working on the painting of the interior and the bar (which look like copies of any Jimmy Buffett bar between here and Key West), but I wish they would have spent more money on their food quality. I think the burgers would have been a lot better had they not been burned. All 4 were charred and not tasty. 

I think if you were purely going into the bar to drink rather than dine and you like the laid back atmosphere of the tropics and don&#39;t expect too much out of that type of bar, you won&#39;t be upset. However, if you are going to eat, stay away from the burgers until they get them done right. 

I&#39;ll go back and try something else next time and hopefully it&#39;ll be a better experience.

ETA: We went again, this time on a Sunday afternoon during football. The burger was still horrible. Burned on the outside and raw on the inside. My husband had the pizza and said it was bland and somewhat cold. 

I hope they get a better cook before summer comes. Otherwise, I won&#39;t go there to eat again. 

It&#39;ll be awhile before I go back there."

We placed our order and was offered free popcorn, which i thought was weird. For some reason, my friends and i lost track of time and 30 minutes later we realized we didn&#39;t even get our food. I guess our waiter&#39;s shift changed and he decided to sit at the bar while a new waitress asked if we wanted to order anything. What the hell.. ?!

When we got there around 7:15, the patio was understandably full. However, my wise &amp; observant BF had noticed that there was a table outside that happened to be 2 smaller tables pushed together and only 2 people were seated there. So he made a simple request to the waitress handling the patio area that maybe they could seperate one of the tables. She abruptly brushed us off, could not be bothered with the request and was not interested in accomodating us. We were a little caught off guard by the treatment but  were unwaivering in our perservance. We headed back inside to find a table where we were thoroughly ignored by the waitstaff and after 10 minutes of waiting patiently, stomachs growling, we walked out. Never having been there before they certainly put a bad taste in my mouth. I was really looking forward to trying their drinks &amp; their pretzel bread &amp; cheese dip &amp; their Toucan chicken sandwich...Big disappointment!

I have tried almost everything on the menu and have been extremely satisfied with everything. 

They have a very large selection of appetizers. The boneless wings were large, meaty and the sauce was very tasty with just the right amount of spice. The nachos were huge (I could have had them for a meal) with lots of toppings. The jerk chicken is to die for! The bean dip, beer cheese, and onion rings are very good, but my favorite are the Fire Crackers.

The burgers are HUGE (almost too big), 10 ounce Angus beef and have been cooked exactly the way I wanted each time I ordered. The pizza was very good with just the right crust, not too crisp, not too chewy. The chicken sandwich is also very good, a large chicken breast with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise (I prefer it with the honey mustard sauce).

The servers and bartenders were all very nice, friendly and polite. The food and drinks were all served in a timely manner with a smile!

The atmosphere is what I like best. All of the bar is built with real bamboo and thatch roof. The tables were all hand made with various inlaid carvings. The wall sconces, signs, and  hangings give it a very cozy, laid back feel. The two wall size murals were custom painted and give a Caribbean feel which is nice in the middle of Chicago&#39;s cold winter! There are T.V.&#39;s in every corner of the restaraunt/bar, and a large screen on one wall. I was able to get the T.V. station changed to the program i wanted to watch with one simple request. The juke box holds over 30,000 songs, and the place really gets hopping on Friday and Saturday nights. I can&#39;t wait for summer to enjoy the beer garden which is just next to and across the street from Carol Stream&#39;s parks. The restrooms are very nice, neat and clean.  

The owners are extremely nice. They genuinely seem to care about all their customers and would go out of their way to make sure your visit is a satisfactory one.

The prices are all very reasonable. 

Overall I&#39;d say this by far my best restaurant experience, and I will definitely be coming back again and again!"

Time of my visit: Lunch

A buddy of mine recommended I try this place.  So today, I figured I would give it a shot today for lunch.

I ordered fried chicken dinner with two sides.  I was not sure which sides I wanted, so they helped me choose.  I ended up getting mashed potatoes and coleslaw, but they also gave me some corn!  I decided to eat inside.

After I paid, I got my food and started eating.  I ate the mashed potatoes and corn first.  A combo was pretty delicious.  Coleslaw was good as well.

I had my chicken last.  I must say, it probably was one of the best fried chicken I have had.  For me, it&#39;s all about the skin.  There are so many ways to f* it up.  Usually, the skin is rough, but not this one, the skin was soft and did not feel fried. It was excellent!

Overall A+!  The service was also friendly.  I would highly recommend it.  I&#39;ll try to be back for some ribs."

I ordered the fried chicken and again was really disappointed . My pieces were so dry, and wings were so small, practically had no meat on them. The pieces obviously sat for some time.  Corn was just out of a can nothing special. Corn bread again, just ok.  Besides being very pricey. 
The food being so disappointing again was not the reason I don&#39;t want to go back though primarily.  
I needed a carry out container and as I stood in line for that a lady brought her plate back up to the counter after having already been seated and her party had started eating. She informed the cashier/ server that she did not get her correct order... She asked for thighs or legs ( not sure ) but had been given wings.  The server apologized and then proceeded to remove wings from lady&#39;s plate and put them back in the serving tray... I was appalled !!  Any other restaurant would have thrown the 2 wings out ... And Not used the same tongs to mix them back into the tray that would be used to sell to others. I don&#39;t know if the woman ate them or not, seasoned them or not , or touched, spit or sneezed on them ( ok that&#39;s extreme and I&#39;m probably sure she didn&#39;t ) but still I was just really surprised she recycled them ...

Now the food. Good lord the food! This is the definition of soul food and I&#39;m really surprised this place doesn&#39;t get the amount of attention it should. I usually go with the mixed fried chicken (white/dark) with two sides and corn bread. The fried chicken is fresh, crispy, and just tastes homemade.

Here&#39;s some additional pre-review advice: Pack a pillow or a huge caffeinated drink for the trip back home. You will be in a food coma if you manage to finish this hearty meal. 

Every now and then I find myself desirous of something you rarely find in most restaurants. Inexpensive, flavorful veggies and something fried just right. At one time, I thought I would have to drive to the south part of the city to eat this good. Lucky for me, I can bask in this type of goodness close to the nest. 

Priscilla&#39;s is near and dear because it is seriously akin to a Sunday dinner at my grandparents place. Fried food, items smothered in gravy and lots of starches. That said, I grew up feasting like this regularly and indulging on occasion, reminds me of them and they wonderful conversations during those meals. 

Admittedly, it has taken me a few visits to remember the need to share this great find.  I have tried the mac n cheese, fried chicken, fried fish, smothered chicken, collard greens with turkey, collard greens with pork, green beans, corn, candied yams, cornbread and cabbage (over several visits of course). I seriously enjoyed every single item but if obliged to choose, I would say the fish, collard greens and candied yams are my favorites.  

Each dinner comes with 2 sides and cornbread which means in 2-3 visits you can easily have tried as many things as me. 
Happy Eating!!!!"

Pros:
- Collard greens were delish
- Smothered pork chops were tasty
- Portions are nice and large
- They try to make things fresh for you when items are out
- Very friendly!!!!!

Cons:
- Can get costly quick
- I am a spaghetti connoisseur &amp; this didnt meet my standards
- They might run out of fresh items if you come to late

Next time Ill come in and try their fried chicken!"

I love soul food, especially Southern soul food. How anyone could criticize the fried chicken is beyond me. I have not yet tried any of the other entrées, but the oxtails on Thursdays are very tempting. The fried chicken is wonderfully spiced, obviously not frozen, and made just like someone would make it down-home. The candied yams are the most incredible I have ever tasted, and you can even taste the molasses in them. They are just exactly how they should be. The corn is corn, and you can&#39;t say too much about that. The mac &amp; cheese is obviously not for the box, and it&#39;s very tasty. The cornbread is good, but I&#39;m usually too full from everything else to really enjoy it. I always enjoy going to the counter because they&#39;ve always got something nice to say and really smile at you, which you don&#39;t see very often anymore.

Oh soul-la-mio, is what I can say!

From its come hither lighting, to its friendly wait-while-we-pack-it service, to the friendliest workers complete with hair nets, what is not to like? It&#39;s also super clean. 

It matters not what night of the week you intend to stop in. The food is fresh, plentiful, and offers countless choices to mix and match the soul food sampler of your dreams.

When my niece is in from college, we always get 2 dinners to go. Her fave: the baked chicken with olde time corn bread stuffing, and the &#39;greens&#39;. Ya gotta try the greens.

For moi: the fried chicken, not greasy and covered with spices, with candied yams, and green beans. 

Each night of the week, the menu entrees and desserts change, based on availability. And speaking of dessert; the coconut cake with light pineapple filling should not be missed; we also swear by the bread pudding.

Whether it is take out or dine in, you will not be disappointed. Priscilla&#39;s wonderful take on down home, deep country, good ole comfort food is the ultimate."

A strange hankering for fried chicken prompted me to get a fried chicken meal (3 pieces with 2 sides and cornbread) to go. I am sorry to say the meal was pretty dismal. The fried chicken (breast, drumstick and a very small piece of thigh) had soggy skin and a few feathers from the bird still remained on the thigh. The skin was salty and the breast meat very very dry. The red beans were salty and the candied yams were sickeningly sweet (which is not unusual for candied yams though). 

Everything was pre-cooked and sitting under heat lamps at dinner time, including the fried chicken. 

I can take a great tasting meal at the expense of my waistline or heart health once in a while but a bad meal ain&#39;t worth risking nothing.

But all I saw was dried chicken that looked like it was cooked from lunch and sat there all the way to dinner under a heat lamp.

I asked the cashier what was the best there and all she did was read the menu to me . If I wanted the menu read to me I could read it myself I just wanted to know but she recommended and all she gave me was a blank stare so I ended up ordering the last thing she said which was jerk chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.
 
The mashed potatoes were good can&#39;t screw that up.

The mac and cheese was really hard on the top and that part was uneatable. I ended up eating just the bottom half and throwing away the top. What a waste of money.
 
The Jerk Chicken was not jerked but chicken with jerk sauce on the side. The chicken was moist and delicious and was the only redeeming quality of this visit. The jerk sauce was way too peppery and hot it was mostly peppers and just a little bit of the other stuff to make it jerk sauce and I ended up not eating the jerk sauce and having the grilled chicken alone and if I order the grilled chicken alone it would have saved me a dollar what a waste that&#39;s two dollars now I wasted.
 
Overall this place is overrated then I will not be going back again because there are better places right next to it."

Everyone else ordered the fried catfish.  They said it was delicious and they each came home with enough food for another meal.  You go to the counter to order your food and you pick it up like a fast food chain, but the quality of food is much like grandma&#39;s home cooking.  I would go there again.

So when my girlfriend and I saw that Priscilla&#39;s was opening up a spot near my old house, I knew we had to try it.  We&#39;ve since come back several times, and we&#39;re always satisfied with our meal.  

I suppose I should probably start with the fried chicken dinner I always order here.  They offer you a choice of white or dark meat.  It&#39;s always dark meat for me, and they usually offer three pieces (sometimes I&#39;ve gotten four though). The meat is flavorful and you get a good-sized serving of chicken.  It&#39;s not the best fried chicken I&#39;ve had -- it&#39;s not crispy -- but it&#39;s still very good.  I&#39;ve also tried Priscilla&#39;s smothered chicken and smothered pork chops, and those are also very good.  

Each of their dinners comes with two sides.  I go for the mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  They give you a very generous scoop of each, and thank God they do because those are some damn good sides!  You also get a piece of cornbread with your meal.  Frankly, I&#39;ve never come across a piece of cornbread I didn&#39;t like, and their cornbread was no exception.  

On one visit, we decided to try their peach cobbler.  Sadly, we weren&#39;t fans of it even though we really wanted to like it.  Something about it was just a bit &#34;off.&#34;  It&#39;s OK though because we come here for the chicken (me) and catfish (my girlfriend).  

We&#39;ll keep coming back to this place.  The prices are reasonable, the portions are big, and the staff is friendly."

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place since it opened because 1) I&#39;m not a soul food expert but have loved it when I&#39;ve had it and 2) there is always something comforting about fried chicken.  

So finally a situation presented itself to give it a try.   Stopped in on Sunday and got an 8 piece chicken dinner with one large side.   Ordered the mac and cheese which was awesome.  The chicken itself was tasty albeit a touch spicy for my group (kids) and I was disappointed they didn&#39;t have any chicken breasts on a Sunday at 6 but also understood it was the end of the run.  They made up for it by adding extra legs into the batch.   Also ordered the candied yams which got a mixed review due to the inclusion of a baking spice (nutmeg perhaps?).   The cornbread muffins were good but as someone mentioned, Boston Market&#39;s were better.  Also got red velvet cake which was good but not mindblowing.

The service was great - she helped me through the menus and talked about what she liked there.   Everyone was so darn friendly.

All in all, I will add this to my rotation of local carryout places and looking forward to trying some new dishes as well like the fried catfish."

This is probably my 2nd time eating here and I must say, I wish i tried it earlier. 

Not sure how the menu works, but I believe that there&#39;s different options for everyday. So obviously I looked at which day it was and just went from there. Had to go with the fried chicken dinner. 3 pieces of chicken, 2 sides, and a bread. Some may think it&#39;s a little pricey at 8.99 but I feel like it was pretty good portion. 

Though my personal opinion is just that Boston Market corn bread was better (still a little bitter). But yea, the big factor for me for giving this place 5 stars is just that the staff was very friendly. I came it and took my time while ordering and the lady behind the cash register wasn&#39;t impatient or anything. Then when I got my food from another lady, she told me to enjoy. Then before leaving, a third lady told me thanks and to have a nice day. I love good service."

In Chicago, it&#39;s hard to find good places.  There are some gems, but few and far between.  So imagine my surprise and happiness when Priscilla&#39;s Ultimate Express opened right across the street.  Not right across the street for you stalkers, but close enough.
It&#39;s kinda set up like Boston Market, where a lot of the food is already prepared and you choose what you want.  3 of us went, one had the fried chicken, one had the half broasted chicken and I had the beef short ribs.  The short ribs were doused in some sauce.  Pretty yummy but a tad salty.  The chicken dishes were both good. 
The sides.
I think the sides are excellent.  The mac and cheese is delicious.  The candied yams have some nutmeg I think in them.  It gives it a little kick.  But those are saccharinely sweet...
The collard greens are yummy and you can get it with either turkey or pork.  I got the turkey and it had a nice smoky flavor to it.

Southern food isn&#39;t exactly a commodity in the area, and no, Popeye&#39;s doesn&#39;t really count.

So I stopped in over lunch to see what they had. What really surprised me was... they didn&#39;t have a lunch menu. All that was there was dinner prices. Which is fine, but I picked up a baked chicken entrée meal. This set me back $10.99, plus tax, without so much as a drink!

The 8 pieces chicken meal (with one large side and possibly some corn bread) was a more reasonable $9. I thought about going with that, but that would be far too much food. As it was, I had leftovers, so $5.50 / meal isn&#39;t bad.

So I had the baked chicken, which was wonderfully moist and very well flavored, with candied yams and rice with gravy. Avoid the rice with gravy, as there was nothing particularly special about the parboiled rice or white gravy. But the candied yams tasted nice and sweet; a good example of what I was looking for when I went there.

The whole thing was accompanied by sweet cornbread (I thought you weren&#39;t supposed to use sugar in cornbread in the south?), which was buttery and very good.

Take a group here if you&#39;re going to go; they give you a ton a food, but there is a bit of a price premium to it, too."

Please see my review of the Streamwood location for my background  and love of Soulfood.

The basic premise: you get a main meal (options rotate daily), 2 sides, a cornbread muffin, and a drink. The prices are a bit high for me -- hence the 4 stars instead of 5 - but as I said, if you&#39;ve got a craving....it takes care of it. 

This location is like the cafeteria, except smaller and more compact. I mainly go for the fried chicken and the red velvet cake when I&#39;m not training. 

Around here, your options for fried chicken mainly consist of KFC and Popeye&#39;s, neither of which do anything for me. Tonight I tried the baked chicken, and it was just as good as the fried. The sides we all shared tonight were mashed potatoes, corn, candied yams and mac and cheese. My kids ate all the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. They love it. 

Topped it off with Sweet Tea. Yum.

It&#39;s in an odd location, where the Boston Market used to be. I wish they had breakfast and lower prices. But it&#39;s worth the trip, and if you are craving fried chicken -- GO. Go right now. Get the chicken.

Amazing Fried Chicken... it does not compare to KFC, Popeyes, etc.. It is homemade goodness. Plenty of seating inside.  I wish the sauces were lableled so I knew which one was ketchup, bbq sauce, hot sauce etc.

Mac and Cheese was delicious and is a MUST SIDE.  Cheesy crust on top.  My 2nd side was the candied yams.  They were good, but I was not a fan.  There was a weird spice in there that I did not care for.  I would guess nutmeg, but I still ate it.

Corn Bread was okkkkay.  A tad bit cold.  If it was hot, it would have be real good.

Overall, very very good.  i wish the food was a bit hotter (tempature wise)  I was there toward closing, so maybe the heating lamps weren&#39;t enough at that point.

Went in to pickup carry out around dinner twice.  The fried chicken was pretty disappointing.  The Chicken was super oily and the batter was very bland.......hate to say this but popeye&#39;s flavor blew them away.  I did order some fried Catfish and that was excellent.  I&#39;ll prob try them again since I live up the street.

And her sides are simply amazing.  The fried chicken (all white meat for me, but they offer mixed and all dark too) is tender and juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  The fried catfish is the meatiest filet of catfish I have ever seen and the purest white in color (not grayish like some catfish).  It is also juicy on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside.  And I love to add the hot sauce to both for  little extra kick in flavor.  

And my husband has tried almost everything on the menu now  - from ham hocks to smothered pork chops to ribs to baked chicken  - and loves it all!  The one area of the menu that we weren&#39;t particularly impressed with were the desserts but that&#39;s probably because we&#39;ve always been so full after eating the hearty entrees.

Priscilla will make a soul food lover out of almost anyone with her delicious food!"

I used to go to the Boston market in this location so I figured I&#39;d give the new restaurant replacement a try. I was pleasantly surprised. 

The menu is basically classic &#34;soul food&#34; i.e. collard greens, fried chicken, smothered food...etc and just like classic soul food, its great for your taste buds and your &#34;soul&#34; but bad for everything else haha. Lots of sugar, fat and salt in most of the menu items but then again most restaurants are moving in that direction these days (see KFC double down sandwich) so I don&#39;t really mind.

The Pros: Great tasting great quality food and side dishes. 

The Cons: Not great for healthy eating or people dieting. 

The Price: Very reasonable, should be under 20 (around 9-15) for a full meal. 

Come here for a great filling meal at a reasonable price!...but not too often if you care about your health."

The catfish was crispy and savory with a little kick, but I thought it was kind of cold like it hadn&#39;t been fried to order. The beef short ribs were braised in gravy. They were tender, but very greasy and kind of had a gamey liver taste. I&#39;m not a beef, chicken or pork eater, so they weren&#39;t my taste. My honey thought they tasted good but again, were greasy. The mac &amp; cheese was delicious! Very cheesy, creamy, and had that oven-baked crust that&#39;s makes the sun shine brighter. The greens were good, not great. A little pepper vinegar made them much tastier. The corn bread was the BEST I&#39;ve ever had. The sweet tea is pure syrup and oh-so-delicious.

My fried chicken dinner:
3 pcs of chicken (dark, white or mixed selection)
1 hunking scoops of dense mashed potatoes and gravy

1 medium sized corn bread muffin

all for $8.99

Compare that to a KFC dinner for $6
2 pcs of fried chicken
1 small portion of coleslaw
1 biscuit

I think Priscilla&#39;s is a pretty good deal!!

I loved my fried chicken - not oily at all. Very crispy and moist. 
the dense mashed potatoes were soooo good. I loved them! and the collard greens were cooked with ham and turkey so very flavorful and not too salty.

Dressing is usually savory, and they don&#39;t have it on display probably for that reason. The short ribs sit out so long that they are just burnt to a crisp but they will continue to serve them and be selfish while doing so.

I don&#39;t even care that they sell ribs and pizza at the same time. Who does that? Who cares!

Look, I visited Chicago a few years ago and tried one of the most popular deep dish pizzas they had to offer but it somehow did not compare to this pizza here. It looked ugly as hell but boy did it stand up good by itself (bruh, double crust! DOUBLE. CRUST.)

We even had a crying baby in the car waiting on this pizza. IT WAS WORTH THE CRYING BABY.

They are the only joint in the area to get food at after midnight. (delivered) 

I had just settled into my new apartment and wanted to order some grub from Mug&#39;s as I didn&#39;t feel like cooking after a long day of unpacking. 

I placed my order right after midnight on 6/26/15. 

I ordered: 

(1) Rib and Chicken Dinner (w/ Fries + Salad w/ House Italian) 
(1) 1/2 Slab Rib Dinner (w/ AuGratin Potatoes + Salad w/ Ranch) 

This totaled $35.91 w/ delivery, tax, and a generous tip. 

My food finally arrives around 1AM and the driver calls my phone to announce his arrival. 
The guy could barely talk he was so intoxicated. The smell of alcohol and MJ were extremely obvious. The entire bag reeked as if he was smoking in his vehicle. 

I shook my head and went upstairs to eat my food. I open the bags and all that is there is a slab of ribs, a half order of fries, and a cup of Italian Dressing. Obviously, not what I ordered. 

I called the store and was immediately placed on hold after the girl answering yells &#34;Pizza Place!&#34;. Ten minutes go buy and the manager ERNIE (also franchise manager, more on this later..) answers the phone. I explained that my food was incorrect and I would like redelivery or to refund my money with GrubHub. 

As soon as I mentioned the issues, he decided he could no longer speak english. He also got a nice case of the giggles. He told me in &#34;broken english&#34; he would not redeliver and wouldn&#39;t issue me a refund. I asked him his info. His name is Ernie and he is ALSO the franchise manager/director for the entire &#34;chain&#34; of Mug&#39;s locations. (Des Plaines, Schaumburg, Arlington Heights..etc) I noted this and informed him I would contact GrubHub. He said he didn&#39;t care, and told me what is in the bag is what I get. Regardless, of WHAT I PAID FOR. 

Fed up, upset, and losing my appetite, I called GrubHub customer care and explained the situation. They told me this isn&#39;t the first they&#39;ve heard of this. They called the location and were demeaned, laughed at, and threatened. Needless to say, ten minutes later the rep gets back on and said he finally gave in and credited my money. I did receive my refund from GrubHub. 

Interestingly, GrubHub no longer lists Mug&#39;s AH on their list. It may change, but I&#39;m hoping not. 

As a customer who used to order 3-4x a month, I&#39;m truly disappointed. 
I&#39;m shocked at the attitude of the location, as well as the franchise manager Ernie. 

DO NOT order from here, you will receive whatever they decide you will get. 

*Plus, I do not condone or support a business that allows their drivers to drive while under the influence of alcohol or any other illegal substance.* 

Will post proof photos under the main business page for this location."

Lately, the food quality really has slipped, at least at the A.H. location.

Their pizza used to be agreeably spicy with a flavorful crust. Now, it&#39;s just bland. This may be a combination of altering the original pizza recipe, and not being properly prepared. My last pizza was overcooked (as this location tends to do), not warm and the cheese wasn&#39;t sufficiently melted. It also lacked tomato sauce and just wasn&#39;t tasty. The nondescript crust also seems to have gotten thinner (not a positive, in my opinion). Some of the chicken wings that I also ordered  tasted like they had been cooked well in advance and left lying around (maybe left over from the last order).

I&#39;ve stopped ordering from Arlington Heights, but might consider the Des Plaines location in the future (if convenient)."

We ordered via grub hub and the pie arrived in about 30-45 mins which is quite acceptable for a Friday night. The pizza was a large sausage and pepperoni and the pizza was pretty true to Chicago style thin crust. The cheese was bubbly  and good, the sauce was only the very slightest bit sweet and the sausage was savory while the pepperoni was about average. I&#39;d say this pizza stacks up well with other northwest suburb pizzerias like nino&#39;s. Two distinctions are that the 1. prices are a little bit cheaper than most and 2.the crust is a little bit thicker than most Chicago thin. Imo, true Chicago thin crust should have a slight &#39;crisp&#39; quality to it. This crust was not very crisp and this may be important to Chicago natives so choose wisely your pizza pie...."

May seem normal, but it&#39;s actually not as most pizzas today arrive in about 40 minutes.  Driver asked for tip.  (And be aware, by the way, that tipped employees ARE, in fact, required to make minimum wage...   if they make less then this in tips, the employer is required to give them enough to be equivalent to minimum wage.)  
    
This driver asked for this tip in fact right as I was about to notice he looked tired and apologize for not being able to tip due to being homeless and having paid $7 for this over PayPal without which I would not be able to read or carry things due to physical weakness due to lack of food because using PayPal money and these coupon codes in various places is the literally the only possible way for me to get food now, until the food stamp office decides to do it&#39;s job. Of course my explanation to him would have been shorter, but I wanted to make an exception and mention it because he looked tired.  When I called the restaurant at 2:50 because they close at 3 and my pizza had not arrived nor a call, and I wanted to make sure they did indeed have the order, they did not even answer the phone.

In addition to this, the pizza was cold. Had a weird, not-even-remotely BBQ-like taste underneath the cheese of the BBQ pizza.  Crust is dry, and neither crispy nor soft.  Chicken tastes like it came from a bag of frozen chicken pieces which have been been refrigerated as leftovers, and then reheated, twice, and is also incredibly dry.  The ONE and only thing this restaurant did right is that there is a lot more cheese...    slightly more then the amount you&#39;d expect to be on every pizza if you&#39;d never had pizza before but knew what pizza was.  (That was not the reason for giving 2 stars; it&#39;s still not as bad as Little Ceaser&#39;s or something - although Little Ceaser&#39;s DOES usually actually do what they are supposed to do, such as having the meat be either meat-like or burned.)  There is also only a very, very, very tiny amount of green herbs visible on the pizza.  (I know not all pizza&#39;s herbs are visible, but this one&#39;s clearly are and there is a very tiny amount of them.)  

As anyone knows without reading any review if they are looking at the menu to consider ordering, they are also very expensive."

I ordered delivery at 1am and after a hour and 45 minutes decided to call back to get an eta on delivery and was told the driver already arrived but all the lights were off so he left.  All my lights were on, including the porch light so it was a flat out lie.  Then the rude lady on the phone began to laugh while she informed me that she called several times, another lie because the phone never rang.  Their excuse of the lights being off so they didn&#39;t knock doesn&#39;t fit with them saying they called several times, why would you be okay with waking me up with excessive phone calls but be afraid to knock?  I accidentally called the Schaumburg location back to asked for management&#39;s info and was told that they constantly receive complaints about the Arlington Heights location."

I used to order their cheese pizza all the time but this time it was thin, instead of fat &amp; glamorous with loads of gooey cheese. The greek salad was missing kalamata olives and maybe a pepperoncini, or two?  

I&#39;m clearly saddened by the pizza. I used GrubHub to order, maybe they have a grudge against them.  :("

To begin, the phone girl was extremely rude to me upon placing my order. After being quoted an hour delivery time, I received my order about an hour and a half later, at which point I wasn&#39;t even hungry anymore. The delivery guy didn&#39;t offer me change, instead leaving my house before I could protest. 

My pizza was cold and ultimately wasn&#39;t what I asked for. I called back to voice my concern, and the phone girl was extremely rude to me in return, not once apologizing, but instead attacking me, even going so far as to call me a liar about my pizza being late. 

I&#39;ve worked in the pizza industry for years, and I&#39;ve never had such a horrible experience with customer service before. I didn&#39;t even bother eating more than one or two bites of my cold, uncooked, wrongly delivered pizza. 

I&#39;m hoping that the GM will resolve my issues tomorrow, but until then, I&#39;ll leave my review as is. Please don&#39;t waste your money when the staff is so rude to the customers!

 I will never order from here again, which is a disappointment considering it&#39;s one of the only late night delivery services in our area. After the attitude I&#39;ve received after receiving a screwed up order, I&#39;d rather order from a chain restaurant, where customer service is actually valued."

I love thick crust.  Yet Mugg&#39;s is the only place where the crust and the pizza itself is thin yet I can DEVOUR it.   Some places just sprinkle the toppings on but Mugg&#39;s COVER the pizza and are fresh.   
My large 3 topping pizza with a $1.50 off coupon is about $20.  But it&#39;s so filling because of the toppings that I stay full longer after I&#39;ve eaten.
This is TMI, but because the pizza isn&#39;t greasy I don&#39;t get an upset stomach after eating.  I don&#39;t know why but store bought, frozen, Ninos, Ginos, and other major pizza restaurants upset my stomach...  Mugg&#39;s is the only place that doesn&#39;t.   
I&#39;ve sent 5 people here and they&#39;ve all been very impressed considering from the outside looks run down...  and did I mention that they deliver all the way to Milwaukee Blvd?

However unfortunately all the reviews I read on this place are true in one way or another. I cannot comment on the food being that I had to cancel my order before it even arrived. when my boyfriend and I tried to order from a new place The female I spoke to was very short, cutting me off when trying to place my order. Before I could get another word in wanting to make sure she got an apartment number she said have your card ready followed by a click. While waiting for the food to be delivered which I placed the order at 10:45 PM I was working away on one of my many projects. Not realizing how much time had gone by since I placed the order until my boyfriend interrupted me saying where are they at? I looked at my phone to see what time it was and it was now 12:00 AM and had been an hour and 15 minutes and mind you it was only a Thursday night. So I called there and it took about a minute for somebody to answer the phone. The rude girl that I had spoke to previously was the one who answered the phone again and I said that I had ordered at 10:45 and I was kind of wondering where the food was at. No response from her yet just she just put me on hold. She then pick up the phone said the delivery drivers five minutes away and hung up on me not even giving me the chance to say one thing. So we bared with it because I know working in the industry stuff happens. 12:30 AM rolls around and we had both had had enough we had given  them plenty of opportunity to deliver this food given that we are no more than 10 minutes down the road and An hour and 45 minutes had gone by. So again I called back having the same girl answer the phone this time I only had to wait about 30 seconds for someone to pick up and I had said I want to cancel my order because I ordered at 10:45 it&#39;s been almost 2 hours now you told me the delivery driver was five minutes away which clearly wasn&#39;t true. And her response was OK and hung up on me. I was Very disgusted by the customer service and definitely would never recommend them nor order from there ever again. I had mentioned my experience to someone and they had said why didn&#39;t you call there and talk to manager. I laughed and said well given the yelp reviews I&#39;ve read that doesn&#39;t get you very far. Also for a place to allow continuous bad yelp reviews to appear on the same issues with the same  individuals it&#39;s clear to me they don&#39;t care. Being a manager of a restaurant myself having to deal with issues like this on a day-to-day basis it&#39;s sad to see a place being one that doesn&#39;t care about their customers and value their feedback being good or bad."

I&#39;ll give this place a try again in the future, though Tortorice&#39;s will still get the majority of my thin crust pizza business.

The last time, well ... I didn&#39;t get to eat &amp; here&#39;s why. I called them yesterday (Friday), ordered ribs &amp; pizza for delivery. Girl on the phone put me on hold a few times, took my order - rushed me through it by asking &#34;is that all&#34; each time I said something. She said, ok... it&#39;ll be an hour. Gave me a total. I ordered at 6:20. Waited, waited and waited some more. At 7:50 I call them saying I ordered for delivery over an hour ago, where is it? 

Stupid girl said &#34;The caller (who was me) said it was a pick up.&#34; Uh NO! I said delivery. She insisted &#34;the caller&#34; said pick up. So I asked her... Pick up takes AN HOUR because you told me it was an hour??? I think her stupid brain kicked in at the moment and she thought... crap! 

They offered to deliver my food, the cold (it&#39;s not cold, it&#39;s been on a warmer) nasty food to me within 30 minutes or so (the OR SO is probably like an hour or so). 

Then they offered to remake me new food and redelivery it within the 30 minutes or so. Gave me a new total of $39 something! 

Seriously... you people screw up, offer to delivery me cold food and then reoffer to deliver me food after 3 hours and NO SORRY, NO DISCOUNT, NO FREE DELIVERY!

Guess what... NO MORE! 

Beware ordering from here. Read the reviews... Food may be good, but don&#39;t get delivery!"

The chicken was super tasty and was still crispy when I got home.  The ribs were meaty and finger lickin good.  The dinner roll was frickin awesome and I wish I had more of that instead of the somewhat soggy steak fries, but fries don&#39;t usually hold up well unless theyre separated.  

The highlight of the experience was while I was waiting for my order (I didn&#39;t call ahead, just showed up so I expected to wait) I ran my battery down and the darn thing died on me.  A Mugs delivery guy was kind enough to give me a jump and I was on my way home to rip into some tasty food.  extra star for excellent service!

I grew up in the area and I had never even heard of them until a friend just recently recommended them to me. I am not going to lie.... when my husband and I found out that they were open til the wee hours of the morning, we figured it must taste like crap and must be a pizza that you eat when you are drunk. :) To our amazement, the pizza was delicious! We have only had the thin crust, so I can not comment on the deep dish. We have had it several times now- pepperoni, sausage, green pepper and cheese. I would say it is a cross between a Barnaby&#39;s and Rosati&#39;s. ( A good rosati&#39;s, because as you may know, not all rosati&#39;s are the same.) The cheese is very fresh! love it!"

YOU COULD NOT CUT THE MEATBALL IT WAS SO HARD!!!!!!!

I&#39;ve tried to think through why that meatball was so hard and all I can think of is either the food is microwaved or the meatball was sitting in a pot for days.  Either way, I don&#39;t think I want to ever eat at this place again!!!!!!!"

We were then told about 30 minutes later that they now had a driver and we could place an order for delivery. I ordered the chicken gyros and I feel like I got ripped off. The fries were cold, the lettuce they gave me was brown, the tomato they gave me was sour (gross), and they gave me a mountain of gyro meat with only one small pita.

We ended up singing Karaoke for the 1st time as it was Karaoke night. We had a good time and the following week, we told our co-workers to join us. This was the start of a weekly get together in which the United Airline employees would pack the place thus making them A LOT of money. To this day, United employees pack the place. Their food is really good and they have a decent selection of beer. They have daily specials as well. Jimmy, one of the owners, is very friendly and customer oriented. (END OF YELP OR PAPS EDIT) 

***seems as though someone went in and edited my review for this establishment! How did that happen Yelp??

Let&#39;s try this again....with the business my buddy and I brought to the place, they treated me like a POS when my cousin from Colombia forgot his passport (ID) at my place. Upon leaving to get his passport, George proceeded to talk badly about us. Not a good way to treat long time customers. The only reason I found out was because the same people I introduced PAPS to let me know when we got back 15 min later. I guess it&#39;s his way of saying thanks to all the business I helped bring to his establishment."

The rest of the food (burger, fries, soup, sandwiches) is a definite hit and miss. $2.35 for a simple order of fries, and some of them are inedible. Their prices are a bit on the high side as well.

The place was very clean and well kept. I have to take a couple stars off because the food seemed to be worn-out and mushy looking and tasting as if it was originally prepared a week ago and frozen and reheated a number of times. I had the meat lasagna. This was on special for around $10.50, but was only worth around $6.50 or so. Some entrees include soup, which mine was good, but I would suggest that they give a smaller portion of soup with an entree. I filled up on soup (and so did my friends) before the entree showed up. I think they have to bring down the prices and improve the freshness of the food to succeed. The owner introduced himself to us at the end of our meal. That was nice.

I had one very bad experience where the meal served appeared to be leftovers-stale bread and a cold main course that seemed to have been prepared hours earlier.  I recently had a ham off the bone omelette with cheddar cheese and broccoli. It was quite good, ample in size, fresh tasting and well cooked (perhaps a bit too salty). The hash browns were slightly undercooked but still tasty.

Subsequently, I had a patty melt, fries, onion rings and cream of mushroom soup. The word that best describes this meal is BLAND. It seems they serve the cheapest and least flavorful frozen french fries on the market. Same with their onion rings. At times it appeared there was some kind of actual string under the batter and not onions. The soup and sandwich were decent, but again bland tasting. I don&#39;t go to a restaurant for this kind of food no matter what the price.

We tend to favor &#34;greasy spoon&#34; family restaurants opposed to expensive chains. We thought that the establishment would be decent since it is located in downtown Arlington Heights--it looked very quaint from the outside. Unfortunately, our dining experience was very disappointing. 

For starters, upon entering the establishment, we had to wait a long time to get seated. There was no sign of a host or hostess, and a waitress was too busy making senseless conversation with other elderly guests. She made eye contact with us several times, yet she never paused to greet/seat us.  After a few minutes of waiting patiently and mumbling profanities under our breaths, we were finally seated.

The decor and ambiance was very confusing. On the walls were amateur oil paintings that could be purchased for ridiculously high prices.  Perhaps they were attempting to support the arts in the area? The color blue was everywhere and created a drab mood and made us feel as though we were dining in a hospital cafeteria or nursing home during the 1980s. Our conclusions about the decor were confirmed when we scanned the dining room; other clientele included local elderly patrons that appeared to be regulars. In fact, my partner and I were the youngest ones there!

Our waitress was somewhat rude and intrusive. She did not offer us a lunch menu, but offered it to other tables.  We waited a long time before she came to take our order.  In fact, she walked up to our table, asked us if we knew what we wanted, we replied with a yes, and she yelled &#34;GOOD!&#34; and walked away to help other guests.  My partner and I were shocked.  I&#39;m not sure if she was trying to be cute by acting all snarky, but that just doesn&#39;t work in the service industry.  Sorry.  Also, she gave us a hard time about sampling the hollandaise sauce. She claimed that their Eggs Benedict was the best and assumed we would take her word for it. The hollandiase sauce was average at best. When the food arrived, it was abundantly clear that the cooks had no idea how to poach an egg; in fact, the eggs were hard boiled. Interesting. Overall, the food was edible, but not of the greatest quality. 

We will not be dining at this establishment again."

i sat down and noticed a smell i didn&#39;t like. not sure what it was - maybe the food at the table behind me? anyway, i ordered the corned beef hash as planned and it was the mushed and then fried kind. not too salty though, which was good. but it was terribly greasy. i mean even more than necessary. also, i ordered my eggs poached and they came over medium. not sure if that&#39;s normal for them.

people here were nice though. my waitress was sweet and the cashier was too. i just don&#39;t think i could be back on account of the food. if i were a regular here and knew others, like everyone else seemed to, i&#39;m sure i&#39;d be a good place to hang out."

I remember my highschool days, where I&#39;d go to a IHOP after watching late night movies, and getting into riftrafting and troublemaking.

In any case, this IHOP is right next to a hotel in good ol&#39; South Barrington, and not so far from the AMC 30, so I would think its a pretty prime location. On the Monday evening, this place was deserted, to no surprised. Upon entering, we saw boes of Kraft Mac N Cheese on the counter -- cool that IHOP uses the same Mac N Cheese that I make for the kids, weird that they don&#39;t homemake their Mac N Cheese, although I guess we are talking about IHOP after all.  

I ordered the steak tips and eggs, that came with pancakes. IHOP boasts several flavors of syrup, and my fave is the strawberry. Super good and tasty. The steak was made to what you want it (medium for me!) and it was cooked just right. Pancakes were nice and fluffy, like I like my pillow (actually no, I like my pillow rather firm) and service was on-point

The staff is always nice and comes by often to ask if we need anything.  No complaints with the food but they did have the biscuits and gravy combo which not all IHOPs carry nowadays so it was a plus.

Kid silver dollar pancake meal a steal at $6 with a drink. My Colorado omelet with bacon, sausage, ham, green pepper, and cheddar was ginormous. I now have a second breakfast waiting for me with the amount I brought back home. 

The bathrooms sucked, so my rating went down. I mean totally sucked with non working toilets, some chick throwing up in the only working stall. So bad I chose to hold it. Man do I have to pee..."

You would think the waitress would have picked up on the fact that most of the food was still on the plates and we didn&#39;t even want to take it home that it might not be a good experience. So when the manager asked how it was we told him.  He took the charges off for the meals and we paid for the tea we ordered.

There was a hair next to my omelet. Right there on the plate in plain, obvious sight. Just hanging out.  Like Garnish. I have a picture.  I won&#39;t post it, but the picture exists as evidence.

The hair clearly did not come from anyone&#39;s head.  To quote my cousin who was dining with me on this day, &#34;look on the bright side, it could be from someone&#39;s armpit and not necessarily from &#39;down there.&#39;&#34;

Okay, so the hair was there.  What next?  I flagged down our server and pointed to my plate.  Her eyes opened wide, then she muttered something, whisked the plate away, and disappeared for a while (probably 15 minutes or so).  So, we sat there and waited, a little dumbfounded. 

My cousin debated eating her food.  She only took a couple bites before she realized it bothered her too.  I didn&#39;t let my kids eat their food (though they sneaked a few nibbles at the pancakes).  I know that it was just my plate that was affected, but still...I was thoroughly grossed out.

So we waited.  And waited.  Our server came back to tell me the manager would be out in a minute.  The manager appeared after another 5 minutes or so.  Said that my meal was on the house.  I should hope so...since you just took my plate away and I haven&#39;t eaten anything!!!!  But, I was still charged for the rest of the meals.  The meals that we didn&#39;t eat.  That&#39;s fine.  I paid it.  Then I went home and emailed IHOP corporate and provided them a picture of the offensive omelet hair.

They responded within a few days.  Gave me three complimentary meals at the same IHOP.  I wasn&#39;t really expecting anything, really.  Most especially, though, I wasn&#39;t expecting that I&#39;d actually RETURN to this IHOP!  But again, I wasn&#39;t expecting anything.  A refund of the other meals would have been nice and ideal, but mainly, I wanted to make a point.  I had no desire whatsoever to eat here again.  A shame since my kids love IHOP and it&#39;s usually a great, quick, kid-friendly, wallet-friendly place for us to eat.

I caved.  We still eat at IHOP occasionally...just not this one.  I wasn&#39;t planning to ever use this comp, but we ended up back here this weekend cuz we were in the area and the kids were really hungry and they saw the IHOP sign and insisted on it. 

Second experience was a total 180 from the above experience.  Meals were hair-free, good, and service was extremely friendly.  The on-duty manager had to register my comp when it came time to pay and once she read the reason for comp, she made sure to ask about our experience this time.  I told her it was great cuz it was.  

But still.  1 star for the first experience."

They always serve the best Breakfast combos, and the food always comes out nice and hot.  Their pancakes are always so fluffy and warm and always a great compliment to my main meal.  

When I find myself at any of the IHOP locations, I always get the Breakfast Combo (2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 pork sausages, 2 pieces of ham, hash browns, and 2 fluffy buttermilk pancakes).  I get to sample all these items and still have my pancakes too.  Another recommendation is their  &#34;Pick-A-Pancake Combo&#34;  (2 eggs hash browns, and choice of 2 bacons strips or two pork sausage links, and your choice of their famous pancake (Chocolate chip, New York Cheesecake, Double Blueberry).   Their Double Blueberry pancake is to die for....ooozing with so much Blueberry goodness.  

IHOP is the best place to meet friend for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.  Some locations are even open 24 hours.  The place is always clean, the wait staff is always friendly (at least on my experience), and the food is always great; not to mention, your not breaking your wallet.

French Toast, bacon and scrambled eggs with a side of B &amp; G&#39;s.  It was delightful and just what the doctor ordered.

They told me that an early morning meeting wouldn&#39;t be a problem as they open at 6am, and have 2 dozen of each kind of bagel made for each day. They also said that they would be able to have coffee travelers made for large parties. This satisfied me. 

Come Tuesday morning, I went to the place at 6:30am. The place was locked, lights off, nobody even inside making bagels. Come 7am, there still wasn&#39;t anyone at the bagel shop. It says right ON THE DOOR, hours are 6am-3pm. No bagels, no coffee, locked door.

Luckily, bagels weren&#39;t the only thing I had on my menu, and I got by with everything else I had bought. But, I had to run to Starbucks on Golf Rd. to get coffee in a pinch. They didn&#39;t disappoint.

Unfortunately they closed down about a year ago.  Since then I have been searching for another one close to where I live &amp; have had to settle for a few other places with terrible bagels &amp; sandwiches.  

Then one day I remembered about this location.  I really enjoy their lox &amp; bagel sandwich.  Each sandwich has an abundance of salmon &amp; it is thinly sliced just the way I like it.  I also get the everything bagel &amp; it is pretty good as well.  

They have a pretty large variety of cream cheeses &amp; bagels here.  I really like the Jalapeno bagel &amp; the salsa cream cheese.  These two selections go very well if you like spicy sandwiches.  

The only reason I am not giving this establishment five stars is because sometimes when they are making my lox &amp; bagel sandwich I notice that the jar they get the salmon from has discolored salmon in it.  They have never put any of the discolored salmon on my sandwich but I wonder why it is in the jar to begin with.  

Other than that this place is big &amp; have plenty of tables to sit at.  The staff here is pretty nice &amp; the service is pretty quick.  I have been h ere multiple times &amp; I plan on eating here again."

Then we went in shortly after the new management took over.  We were blown away that they no longer offered papadum complimentary appetizer.  It was the very first and only restaurant that charged for what is considered complimentary to all other restaurants.   When I asked to speak to an owner or manager about this, I was pretty much told there is nothing that anyone could do and the manager wouldn&#39;t talk to me.  

Then we went a second time, just to give the new management a chance.  Again, I was completely thrown another wild curve ball when I they tried to sneak tilapia in a fish curry which was supposed to contain mahi mahi.  Considering this dish is only made with mahi mahi, it is clear the cook knew what he was doing.  When I shared my disappointment to the waitress, she gave me a blank look, said nothing, and looked powerless over this manipulative switcharoo.  I could tell she wanted to say something, but wouldn&#39;t.  

Consider this a warning to all, make sure you get what you ordered.  Otherwise, you may very well get a primary ingredient switched on your for a cheaper and less tasty substitute.  

This is type of treatment you would expect at a cheap cut-rate restaurant.  I am so disappointed, because the food is usually really good."

The sauce is smooth, rich and intricately layered with flavor from coriander to ginger and cinnamon. I order the butter chicken with the garlic naan every time. The naan is crisp and flaky on one side but nicely buttered and garlicky on the top side. Their standard jasmine rice is al dente and perfectly cooked.

I&#39;ve tried the goat chettinad which was flavorful but crept up on your tastebuds which heat and formidable presence. If you can handle the heat and spice, go for it. India Bhawan takes up a sizable portion of the strip mall but it is beautiful on the inside with nicely appointed adornments. 

Their bathrooms are glitzy to say the least but impeccably clean. I haven&#39;t ventured to the bar area but their house wines are pretty tasty for the money. Be prepared to split dishes because their portions are large. Yelp has a free appetizer (vegetable pakora) if you do their checkin."

I have been here twice now but the food just hasn&#39;t met my expectations.  I would like to give it 2.5 stars.  The service was okay but the food did not taste right overall.  Some items were okay, others weren&#39;t.  For example, one time I went and asked for a spicy Malai Kofta dish, it came out mild and sweet tasting.  And after it was sent back, it came back out with more cumin taste then red chili powder taste.  I am generally not a picky eater and don&#39;t criticize about my food unless it stands out (in a bad way).  I did like their Indian style specialty pizza.  They are not bad.  Some of their apps like Chicken 65, Chili Paneer, and Andhra Cut Mirchi are good.

It&#39;s one of the only things a picky eater like myself likes at an Indian Restaurant. I had a favorite place. It closed. I finally found another favorite place, and then it too closed. I found this place through Yelp a while ago and was finally able to try it a couple days ago! SO happy i did. 

We ordered for carryout. My son went to go pick it up, he said the interior of the restaurant was really nice. I was a little worried, because the reviews are like either 1-star or 5-stars, seems like people either love it or hate it. 

Chicken Tikka Masala: was a little bit more yellow than i like, so i was nervous when i opened the container. But i have to say it was DEEEE-LICIOUS!! My son and i both really, really enjoyed it. It was creamy and buttery and fabulous! Lots of flavor, just a smidge of spice. Based on this first experience, It&#39;s right up there in my top three ever. I was a little disappointed in the size of the serving, when you&#39;re paying $15 for some chicken i guess i kinda expected a little larger container. Ultimately with the extra rice and sides i purchased, it ended up feeding two of us. If we had not gotten sides though, there&#39;s no way it would be enough for two people. 

The Garlic Naan was BEAUTIFUL! Is that weird to say about bread?! lol. See picture. It was truly the most beautiful presentation of naan i&#39;ve ever had. It tasted really nice, as well. Very pleased with the naan. 

Samosa: wasn&#39;t my favorite. I still have one left, i&#39;m going to heat it up and try again, but it just had a little different taste than i&#39;m used to. I usually love samosas. I need to try and put my finger on what I don&#39;t like about this one, and then will update. 

Overall, i think it&#39;s a tad expensive. However from a quality perspective - it was really good food! I am definitely excited to try it again! Looking forward to it.

Tip: per their website, looks like they do deliver! Never seen an Indian delivery place - i think it&#39;s great! Unfortunately, i&#39;m sure we&#39;re too far away so we&#39;ll have to pick it up. But that&#39;s fine. 

Definitely worth the try!!"

Sambhar recipe may need to be tweaked.... It seems mild, and needs more spice and tangy flavors. Service was responsive but key staff seemed extremely busy. 
There was a private party that evening in the main dining area. This created a huge noise factor for diners (family members singing with microphones).

Let&#39;s start with the service. We sat around and waited for a while before we got water, then sat a while again before we were able to place our order. It also took 40 minutes for our food to come out. One of the dishes wasn&#39;t even warm when it came out.

Like many others have pointed out it is a new restaurant and one section of the restaurant was still undergoing reno as we were dining. This was a tad annoying at times with the drilling sound.

We ordered the Medhu Vada, Onion Pakora, Chicken 65, Paper Masala Dosa, Onion Rava Dosa and Chicken Chettinad with Naan. 

What we thoroughly enjoyed :::: were the Medhu Vada, Onion Rava dosa and Naans. The vada was fluffy &amp; crunchy! The Onion Rava Dosa was superb in texture and taste.

The rest of the food items were good but nothing extraordinary. The Chicken 65 tasted like a simple chicken fry tossed with curry leaves. The Paper Masala Dosa was over done on one side. This biggest disappointment was the Chicken Chettinad which was loaded with pepper and other Indian spices. Those flavors were very dominant and did not allow us to enjoy the dish. This was such a shame since the chicken itself was juicy and very nicely cooked.

Food service was a tad slow as well.

An OK experience overall. Am hoping to try the restaurant once they are well set up and hopefully have another favorite in India Bhawan."

On top of this they charge a tip for the buffet, on your bill for 5 or more pax.

When asked the owner says he does not pay his servers and they are paid only by tips.

Who charges you tips for a buffet.

It&#39;s a rip off


I understand Amit., but my concern is, If it&#39;s called a tip or gratuity it must be negotiable. 

My objection was on two levels. First, the mandatory nature of a fee for service that&#39;s generally expected out of a buffet restaurant. Second, I usually tip 10-15%. I could be persuaded to tip by a suggested tipping. But when it comes to mandatory tipping it&#39;s more of a service charge and not a tip which is usually at my discretion."

Spice level is generally on the high side which I appreciate. Tandoori Chicken brought sizzling to the table and Dosa available for asking. Rarely do I encounter Northern and Southern cuisine on the same buffet so expertly prepared. The atmosphere of the restaurant is clubby and cool...Very nice. Large space. Comfortable and friendly. Highly recommended!

It has beautiful chandeliers and colored lighting that changes throughout our meal. Definitely a good idea for a date night! The food was great and came in large portions with 3 choices of naan bread, garlic, butter and herb, but you have to pay extra for it, it doesnt come with your meal. 
The wait staff was very attentive, but we waited longer then I expected to get our food and the resaurant wasnt crowded at all. Also the wait to get our check was longer then expected as well. I like that they have two different menus because they also have a bar section of the restaurant with a bar menu. 
If you choose you can have bar food, like burgers, salads and appetizers. Or if you&#39;d like indian food you can choose that menu in the restaurant. I am going back and this place can easily become one if my favorites."

Starters were pretty decent and they served us hot dosas which was very impressive unlike other restaurants where they just make it beforehand and put it out there. Moving on to main course, I&#39;d say they have very good options for vegetarians. I loved malai kofta, one of the best I&#39;ve eaten so far in US. Everything was flavorful. However, we reached at around 2:30 so couldn&#39;t really enjoy the food as much as we wanted to but it was good. Thumbs up."

There was butter chicken that day, so I was in luck! The servers were better at refilling everything. The tandoori chicken was fresher. I still wasn&#39;t asked if I wanted a drink, though. The servers could be a little more prompt at emptying the table. There were still a few dishes that left something to be desired, the one that stuck out from my yesterday was the hard rasgulla and watery korma. My two lunch buffets experience there demonstrate the buffet items range from amazing to just okay.  Keep up the amazing things, and take out the not so great things! Therefore, I&#39;d like to take my 3 stars to 4!"

Although it was eerily empty, the decor was modern and the staff made us feel quite welcome. We ordered masala dosa for an appetizer and it was sooo good. It was a huge portion and presented with hot Sambhar and coconut chutney. Yum! Then we ordered paneer tikka masala and bhindi amchur. While the paneer was tasty, the okra was amazing. Probably the best we ever had. We had plenty to take home for leftovers. After our meal, we decided that we had to come and try the lunch buffet. So we went on a Saturday afternoon. The options were plentiful and some things were spicier than I could handle but still, the food was great. Hot, fresh naan and tandoori chicken were brought to our table too. We left with happy tummies. 

All and all, the food is a tad expensive but is really, really tasty and we recommend it."

The ambience is great and spacious. Well that&#39;s the only good part of it. Although we were a group of 6 we were crammed up into two tables which could barely fit all our plates and glasses. There was no place for the breads, dosas and tandoori chicken which came in later. We just had to juggle everything between the little space we were left with. When we asked the server if he could add another table so that we could ease out he bluntly replied that it&#39;s Friday and we have lot of folks coming in. Well the place had quite a lot of tables vacant and they remained the same till we had left.

Now coming to the food, there was a lot of variety and almost equal options for both veg and non veg food items. But unfortunately just having lot of options is not good, it also needs to have some taste. The goat curry, chicken curry and tandoori chicken were very low on salt and not very tasty. Tandoori chicken had almost gone dry, probably was sitting on the sizzler for a long time. Other items were ok, didn&#39;t find anything that caught our attention.I have had better Indian food in the vicinity. Most of the folks on our table were visiting for the first time and were not too impressed with the experience. I think the place is still new and has a good scope to improve."

This place is absolutely the best. There is not a dish on the buffet that was not amazing. Even if it&#39;s not your kind of thing, even if you think you would never like it, try it, because you will either like it, or you still won&#39;t like it because it&#39;s not your thing, but you will try to like it because you want to because it&#39;s so damn good.

I would have taken photos of the food, which I like to do, but I ate it too fast and I couldn&#39;t stop myself, so no pictures. Just go eat it. Don&#39;t even take a picture of it. Just eat it. Today. Do it. Go.

Spouse and I have lived in many places where Indian food is ample and wonderful. This is the best Indian food we&#39;ve had in nearly 20 years. Why are you still reading this review? Push the button for directions and go."

When you walk in, though, it has a large spacious, beautiful interior - with a large bar area to the right, an even larger dining area to the left, and a small party room in the back. The decor is what I loved most about this place! It&#39;s sparkly, a modern touch, just beautiful - very different from what you would expect from an indian restaurant - word is, they kept the decor from the italian restaurant that was going to open there prior to them - LOVE it!

We went for the lunch buffet to try as much as we could. There were plenty of items to choose from - Chaat, fruit, salad, samosas, pakoras, gobi manchurian, rice, idli, sambar, chutneys, raita, 5 veg entrees, 5 meat entrees, gulab jamun, ras malai, and fruit custard. They bring fresh masala dosas, naan, and tandoori chicken to the table if you want any of them. The food was decent, not the best I&#39;ve had but definitely not the worst. The samosas were small and delicious! Chaat was pretty good. I really enjoyed the gobi manchurian so I looked past the extreme oiliness. Idli, sambar, and chutney were fine - nothing to write home about. The dosa was a decent size, yet contained maybe half a cup of the masala, which itself was pretty tasteless to begin with. Wednesdays are dosa night, and judging from these dosas - I wouldn&#39;t want to go out of my way for that. The veg entrees were palak paneer, dal makhani, mushroom muttar, potato fry, and navratan korma. I absolutely loved the navratan korma: Extremely flavorful! The mushroom mutter was pretty good. The palak paneer is usually my favorite, but didn&#39;t have much flavor other than the spinach and paneer, the dal makhani was extremely tasteless, and the potato fry was nearly inedible due to how extremely spicy they made it. Another table heard me talk about the spice after downing a glass of water and they agreed that they couldn&#39;t even finish one bite. The fresh naan was great. Dessert was pretty good.

Overall, food was decent - not the best, but there were definitely items I enjoyed. I have never heard of sit down indian restaurants serving pizzas, but they do - and I&#39;m intrigued - I will probably come back to try those at some point when visiting my parents again in the suburbs!

If the owner reads this - seriously, do you know where all that decor is from?? LOVE! :)"

After reading the reviews I was hopeful that India Bhawan would not disappoint, but sad to say I was terribly disappointed.  

From the beginning we waited in the entrance for longer than one would expect for a restaurant that was pretty slow for that time of night on a Friday.  When we were seated the waiter (didn&#39;t have a name tag) kind of tossed the menus in a pile at us and walked away.  We ordered as soon as he appeared, which took so long the hostess came to our table to see if anyone had taken our order.  The chickpea bread with the sauces was very good, but when it was 30 minutes and we STILL hadn&#39;t seen any food we grabbed a server and asked for more and also asked that our water glasses be refilled.  That took 10 minutes and STILL no food.  Took about an hour for our food to arrive and I can&#39;t speak for the rest of my party (though they probably would have eaten the tablecloth they were so hungry) but my Aloo Gohbi (cauliflower and potatoes in a creamy spicy sauce) was probably some of the worst I have ever experienced.  The sauce was hot but the cauliflower and potatoes were warm at best.  The cauliflower was noticeably scant in this dish that had an over abundance of UNDER COOKED potatoes.  I thought the price $13 for a mostly potato dish was over the top.  Again waiter MIA so I asked the hostess if we could get our bill and a takeout box (thought I would take my potatoes home and cook them).  After a few minutes our waiter appeared from the bathroom reeking of smoke and offered to box my leftovers, I declined, paid the bill and left."

We ordered the Baingan Bhartha, Appetizer Sampler, Mango Lassi and Okra Stir Fry, plus Onion Paratha. Everything was AMAZING!!!

The decor and dining room are surprisingly grand and spacious. It is not what you would expect to find in a strip mall....nor is it a carry-out kind of place. The colored lighting is slightly odd and would be better suited in a night club...but it&#39;s also kinda fun. Be prepared for a doggy bag because the dinner portions are large. The Chicken Tika Masala is my go to dish and is always spot on. My only complaint is that you have to pay an extra fee if you want/need another serving of rice.

The restaurant is a new one and all my visits have been just great when it comes to food and service. I have had their executive lunch buffet about 7 to 8 times and all the times I&#39;ve just been impressed with the quality and the spread. Also, I have dined in 5 or 6 times including their dosa  night on Wednesdays and have nothing but great things to talk about this place from the ambiance to food to service. 
Lately, I have seen some reviews which are not that great but then we can&#39;t be rating a place on just one visit. It took me few times to realize that they have been getting better and better day by day as they are getting busier too.  We all have our days and so does a new place. Give them some time and if they are consistent in what they are doing they will do well.
I wish you guys at India Bhawan all the very best and much success, we needed a good restaurant in this area and there you are.
Get some more specials like your dosa night and try harder.

The buffet was out of this world, not only in terms of taste, but in variety of dishes.

This place is huge and very beautifully done, high ceilings, well lit, classy interior and the washrooms were just wow.. I got a chance to peak inside the kitchen and just to tell you all, unlike other Indian places their kitchen is spotless clean and again huge. I was surprised to learn that they are a Indian restaurant but their amazingly beautiful bar had a totally American menu and we tried some stuff from the bar too and gosh!!! One of the best burgers I&#39;ve ever had. Fresh and juicy with lots of sides. 
Now coming to the Indian food which I found one of the best in the U.S. Their portions are huge like the restaurant, kid you not. Every Indian place I&#39;ve been to give you 16 oz bowls or copper handis, this place each entree is 24 oz and you get basmati rice on every table. Chicken tikka masala and Kadai chicken were to die for, chilli paneer and mix grill top notch, dal panchratni was flavorful and one of the best soft naans. Prices are comparable to other upscale Indian places with double the quantity of food. Overall 5 stars and the servers were so friendly and knowledgeable that added a cherry to the icing. A must visit if you want to enjoy some hard core Indian food with classy setup."

The food itself was filling and flavorful. I especially enjoyed the chicken makhani, with it&#39;s nice thick gravy. Naan was hot, soft, and moist.

This place is unlike a typical Indian place from a standpoint of interiors,  service and is very classy with terrific authentic food.  They do a lot of other things like concerts and bands on Saturdays, they also have a huge classy bar where they have Karaoke nights on Fridays.  Have to check it out this Friday as they are open late till 3 in the am. At least some Indian place is thinking outside the box rather than the typical lunch and dinner. I wish them all the luck and success and hope they do well as we needed a good Indian place in Chicago. Highly recommend and if you don&#39;t give this place a try.... Your loss."

Being a punjabi, let me tell you that it was an insult to call whatever you guys prepared as chicken tikka masala. And yes, it&#39;s not cheap if you compare the price with other Indian restaurants, $13.99 for lunch buffet.

Tandoori chicken and naan were brought to the table - piping hot.  My favorites among the entrees were the goat curry and the navratan korma, a delicious mix of vegetables in a wonderful sauce.

I had this misfortune of ordering from this particular Jimmys on 2 occasions. The first time we experienced Jimmys, our order was horribly incorrect.  Due to the fact that we ordered Carry-Out, we didnt realize the order was incorrect until we started ooening the containers.  We ordered a Family meal with 2 quartered chickens, fettucini alfredo and mash potatoes and gravy.   Upon opening we discovered our chickens weren&#39;t quartered, no big deal just an annoyance.  We then opened something i would call mostaccoli alfredo.  No fettucini? Lastly, we did not receive any gravy for our orders of mashed potatoes.  At this point, it wasn&#39;t feasible for us to go back, so instead we called and spoke with the manager Tom.  He was very empathetic and offered us very generous gift cards and he delivered them personally to us.  I felt extremely satisfied and vowed to give them another chance.  I was told they had only recently moved a bit further up Devon, so i chalked the experience up to &#34;the move.&#34;   Mistakes happen.

Well, we waited a while to allow them the opportunity to get situated and such before ordering again.  A few weeks went by and we decided to order from them again (yesterday.)  We placed our order with a lady named Helen.  We asked Helen to repeat our order to confirm everything was correct.  She repeated the order perfectly and, given our past experience, we figured all would be in order this time around. We picked up the order and proceeded back.  We were celebrating a co-workers retirement so we wanted everything to be nice and smooth.  You can&#39;t imagine how incredulous we were to find some of the same glaring errors as before!  No fettucini,  only &#34;mostaccoli alfredo.&#34; No gravy for the 4 or 5 orders of mashed potatoes.  The chickens were quartered this time, thankfully.  We made the best of a bad situation and improvised the best we could.  Of course we were chagrined when we heard repeated requests for gravy.  We also had to field a lot of questions regarding, &#34;whats that mostaccoli dish called?&#34;  Not a fine dining experience whatsoever.

We called amd spoke with the same lady that took our order originally.  Frankly, it seemed she couldn&#39;t care any less.  She stated, &#34;We dont have fettucini alfredo..., ...our mashed potatoes don&#39;t come with gravy (cereal no milk?).. you can come pick up some gravy.&#34;  Absolutely unacceptable. Highly incompetent and unempathetic staff. She seemed unconcerned and even bothered by our complaint.  Mind you, we maintained absolute professionalism and courtesy while interacting with her.  Her responses weren&#39;t a result of an unreasonable or beligerent customer. She seemed to want to say &#34;is that all u called for? i got work to do.&#34; We pointed out that we spoke to her originally and that she repeated our order to us twice.  Why didnt she say anything about gravy not being included with mash potatoes (what respectable restaurant does that?) Why didnt she advise they dont offer any fettucini alfredo?  The reason she didnt do this is because she simply didnt care and lacks professionalism. 

We did not bother escalating any further to Tom, although perhaps we should have, but no matter the conversation or offers, we will never visit this place again, nor will we allow our family and friends to support this place.  Had they delivered quality and accurate service, they would have earned increased business and promotion from our work group.

The drink menu is ok, not great. The food menu is much better. They have the typical apps, salads, chicken, fish, beef, pastas. We started with the potato skins. The portion size is insane! they gave us like 3 whole potatoes! And they were well made. I ordered the chicken piccatta special and my table also ordered a steak and the pork chops.

The Mashed Potatoes were terrible and they were not whipped and fluffy and also tasted full of margarine instead of butter.  There was definitely a change with the potatoes.

Onion soup a little too salty, but still good.   Also served with bread, fresh and warm!  Service was great  the decor a little too &#34;upscale&#34; for my taste.   Would like to go back to check out live music tho"

I came from the far south side of Chicago  (50 miles), so when I pulled in and saw a different name, I was worried.  
The folks at the front desk said they would honor it. Cool.
The decor is classic upscale steakhouse,  not old looking or anything,  but just nice. A little darkly lit for lunch time,  though. 
My server was polite and had good timing (there when you need him, not obtrusive when you&#39;re eating).
I ordered a 22 oz. Rib eye bone-in, mashed potatoes,  a chowder soup and wedge salad. 
The soup was terrific, flavorful and had enough seafood taste without being overbearing. 
The wedge salad was BIG! Bacon bits, Bleu cheese crumbled on it, a hard boiled egg  and Bleu cheese dressing. 
Garlic croutons would have elevated either soup or salad, but the were both great tasting dishes.
The main course came and it looked and smelled wonderful. The classic char smell, beautiful look on the plate. The steak tasted every bit as fantastic as it looked. Potatoes and sauted green beans... just great. 
It was a long drive but we&#39;ll worth it."

The baked potato was between cold and warm and not fully cooked. If fact it could not melt the butter. As others mentioned it is an older crowd and I think this may have contributed to our slow service. Only good thing was 10% discount because we stayed next door at the walkable Country Inn &amp; Suites eunuch does get an above average score.

Reasonable prices for what you get. Our only issue was that we were somewhat ignored our first time when we got here even though we had a reservation. The owner seemed kind of snotty to us but we talked to him a little and he was much friendlier this time. Definitely worth a try.

I replied with &#34;Are you sure?&#34; She said yes...I took the bag in hand and started toward the front where the host had greeted me looking to pay him, no where to be found I started towards the door and a gentleman that had greeted from a seat at the bar when I walked in, motioned towards me to have a good night! This was the owner of Jimmy&#39;s and he payed for my entire meal just on a whim. I cannot describe the gratitude and how much I truly appreciate this act of kindness.

Hubby had Blue Moon and i had red wine.  Didn&#39;t care for the Copper Ridge merlot but the Dark Horse cab was really good.

The music was so fun.  Johnny&#39;s fingers flew across the keyboard and they played so many of our favorites from the 60s and 70s.  The band engaged the audience and that made it even more fun.  People danced (me too) and we sang along with the songs you just had to.  Can&#39;t wait for the next time."

The Food:
I&#39;ve been here on weekends and weeknights. I&#39;ve been here for Valentines day. I&#39;ve had private parties here.  The food is just....eh.  It&#39;s basically a classed up standard greek diner.  The steaks are not Prime and I would question even Choice.  They&#39;re not bad, but they can be dry (especially on the outside) and lacking flavor. Not nearly enough salt on them prior to cooking which makes for a dry crust.

Other food is a little better than your average Greek run family style restaurant.  It&#39;s not a bad place, but you&#39;re paying Wildfire prices for about two steps down in quality and maybe three or four down in flavor.  It seems like they&#39;re stuck on Greek inspired family recipes and don&#39;t really have any POW on the plate.

But it&#39;s not bad and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m getting ripped off.  For us, we go there when we can&#39;t get reservations elsewhere.

the Bar:

Love the bar.  Good drinks and a fun crowd, although on the older end of the spectrum.  Great people watching for middle agers like us, but I think a younger crowd would feel like they&#39;re seeing Grandma dancing at the bar.  Very fun time for us though, we always end up having fun conversations with random people and the live entertainment is a blast.

So, in short...

It&#39;s not a BAD place for a date night dinner, but I wouldn&#39;t take your girlfriend there to propose nor would I say it&#39;s your &#34;once in a life time&#34; date night. It&#39;s not bad for your kids first communion party or a nice meal out with the kids.  I don&#39;t think patrons would be offended by children and it&#39;s spacious enough where you can request a secluded area if you&#39;re planning for the worst with them."

It was almost 10 minutes before anyone came to ask us for drinks.  We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer and there were no tenticles...very disappointing because that&#39;s the best part. I ordered the lamb chops and everything was less than room temperature. Nothing was hot. I think the mashed potatoes were from a box...very loose. A couple of pieces of broccoli and some carrot chunks. The salad looked old. My husband ordered the prime rib that came with a baked potato to go. The meat was raw and cold too. I asked for the Bernaise sauce on the side and that was fine. Took the carrot cake to go and ate that later. That was very moist! Great.
Awesome waitress personality wise but the food was very disappointing. Jimmys charhouse has been in business for many years so I thought it would be a perfect place to go. How can u go wrong with lamb chops at a Greek restaurant but I guess u can. Very disappointed. Can I get a refund please?!"

Worst prime rib I&#39;ve ever had. Tough and chewy, no flavor. My husband had the $26 New York Strip, also not very good.

The other people got steaks.  None of which were cooked to what they were asked to be cooked at. Then when server brought food out, he brought no condiments. So everytime someone needed something, that should have been brought out in the first place, they would have to ask. Lets see alcoholic beverages.............no consistency what so ever.  It is a shame that this place turned into this from Charlies.  Real disappointment.  I will never go here again and feel sorry for the people that do and spend the money and food and service are horrible;"

When we finally got serviced there was a table behind us and the waitress to a couple I was holding this table for you (we were told they don&#39;t hold tables in the bar) This will be the last time I will ever go here and we live two miles from here and we will avoid it and we will tell every one we know not to go best thing for this place now is close and lock the doors and walk away (the manger did nothing) This is a bad start for them ..LIKE I SAID NEVER AGAIN !!!"

The front half of Shelby&#39;s has the vibe of a nice, inviting lounge similar to that of a Caribou, Starbucks, etc.  but that&#39;s where the similarities end.  They have a menu of appetizers, sandwiches, breakfast type foods, and in addition to standard soda/coffee selections, serve wine and beer as well.

I had a chance to sample a grilled cheese on sour dough bread as a snack as I was passing through and was pleased.

Where the biggest twist is... The back half of Shelby&#39;s actually hosts about 6 slot machines/video poker machines.  The machines appear to be penny slots and are multifunction machines, where you can switch between a variety of slot and video poker games on the touch screens, which is nice, so you can play a variety of different games to spice things up.

The service was great, as Robyn was pleasant and sociable from the get go and explained how everything worked.  Sodas are comped while you are playing slots which is a nice little perk. 

From what I hear, more of these types of establishments are going to be popping up in the Chicagoland area.  When you think of slot machines, one often conjures up seedy images of smoked filled rooms.  But, this environment was clean, warm and inviting which was a nice surprise.  It&#39;s not a casino by any means, but you can have a quick bite/drink and entertain yourself with some slots and get your small dopamine rush in a friendly place at the same time.

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s due to regulations, it&#39;d be nice to see a few more machines maybe.  But, I give the extra star due to the very welcoming and excellent service from Robyn for my first visit.  

Will stop by again.  And maybe win back my $20 next time...haha"

These dogs seem worse than the lowest cost ones you can make at home.  I&#39;d rather get a hot dog from Steak &amp; Shake next door.  Or if I feel like driving a couple miles, of course Portillo&#39;s.  Probably won&#39;t get food from here often.

They look nothing like the pics posted thru out the restaurant. The bun had no seed and the actually hot dog was about half the size of a Vienna you purchase at the grocery store. 

The topping were sparse and poor quality. 

For $7 I expected better quality and bigger portions. The fries were a very small portion and the drink is also a small cup.

I think I will take a pass next time.

Called the owner to give him feedback on how i was just in his establishmet and was so disgusted by the food all over the floor and the way his front counter guy handled the situation and all he said was thankyou.

Yesterday my cousin went there and ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and requested grilled onions with some tarter tots.  Chicken sandwiches tasted fresh and flavorful.  Next time I&#39;ll remember to ask for BBQ sauce.

~wide variety of foods, not just your typical hot dog &amp; hamburger options
~clean &amp; spacious place
~fair prices
~clean washroom
~open fairly late
~large menu on the wall
~a lot of photos of the food covering different walls (I once regretted studying all the photos before ordering because I realized there was so much I didn&#39;t know about that I wanted after I placed my order)

One thing they have that I have never seen at another hot dog place is their &#34;cheese logs.&#34; They are basically mozzarella cheese wrapped in a shell that is similar to an enchilada. They seemed to be fried and crunchy with a melted cheese filling. 

They also have plenty of side likes mac-n-cheese nuggets (mac-n-cheese fried into pieces), sweet potato fries and tater tots, not what every hot dog joint has. 

I always get cheese dogs with grilled onions. The dogs are beef and possibly Vienna brand; really good. 

Only thing I was totally happy about was the charge for a cup to get ice water and one of the guys at the cash register seemed to be having a bad night or maybe wasn&#39;t friendly. The second time I went in and he was on the register, he was in a much better mood and more friendly, but I had to wait a half a minute until he got off the phone to place my order. It seemed to be a personal call, but I could have been wrong. 

I have yet to see Big Sammy himself, but he looks like the kind of guy you want to order with; really happy-go-lucky and funny. 

I will definitely return because I don&#39;t know of any other places in the area to get a hot dog at a somewhat late hour and I am in this area a lot. Oh, and for the mac-n-cheese bites and sweet potato fries. And for the cheese logs, too. 

Sometimes when I drive by, I get cravings for the food! Wish this place was closer to my house."

I don&#39;t mind waiting a few extra minutes for hot off the grill food. Cheeseburger is always on point. The gyros are popular. Recently I got hooked on bbq chicken with onion and pickles.

A few small tables, and bar/window seating.  no nonsense, to the point, short and sweet. I like that.  The guys are friendly and quite jovial, which always makes an experience better.

The fries are crisp and delcious, not too salty at all, the cheese they give is on the side, and ample for the fries you order.  My hot dog (with everything) had onions, tomato slices halved, relish, and a big slice of pickle.  It doesn&#39;t need anything added on..

The fries were also just okay. What I did like about them is that they were not overly salty which is a problem with many hot dog places&#39; fries. Drinks are refillable which is a plus.

They don&#39;t pack any napkins or ketchup with your to-go order, so be sure to squeeze your own ketchup into a little tub. 

The service was good here and it&#39;s a nice, clean place to have a meal. They have a big TV which is good for people dining in and eating.

It&#39;s a basic Chicago food joint so there really isn&#39;t much out of the ordinary.

The gyros here are very good. They are also very large. Be prepared to be stuffed for the rest of the day if you eat an entire one.

When I first walked, the room was a fair size. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a restaurant, but they have enough tables for you to sit in. They have one GIANT main board menu full of food options and combos. My dad usually orders their double cheeseburgers with fries. From what I remembered, I ordered a pizza burger (burger with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce), onion rings, chicken gyro, and fried mushrooms (not in one day. Haha).
Their burgers are actually good and cheap. The only complaint I have for them is that the burgers are too greasy for me, and that all the grease ended up making my buns a little more wet... but not extremely soggy. A pizza burger was something unique to me, remembering that burger king had one too. But this place has a really GOOD, different pizza burger! Their onion rings and fries were great sides! I fell in LOVE with their gyros! The sauce is my favorite. What&#39;s great about this place is that they cook FRESH in front of you. I like places that prove to me that they cook fresh once you&#39;ve ordered.
What I hated though were their fried mushrooms. The appearance looked appealing, but the inside had the worst batter. The batter made the mushrooms so wet (no, not grease) that it gave the mushrooms such a gross texture and taste. Will never order that again! 
Otherwise, I see why my dad loves going here."

I got my soda, a Dr. Pepper and the flavor was totally off. So I went back up to the self service machine and got myself a Pepsi instead.

I have to say, I disagree. While it wasn&#39;t the end of the world...it&#39;s still part of the experience. Plus, I don&#39;t drink soda, so I was looking forward to it! The little things in life...

Enough of that though. I split a gyro and two hot dogs (which came with fries) with my mom. The gyro was pretty good...your typical gyro. I got an extra side of tiziki sauce because I can never have enough (for 40 cents, whatever...no biggie). I kinda wish their hot dog buns had poppy seeds but other than that typical hot dog joint."

As for the prices, these are general prices that you can find at most places.  

As for the service I mentioned in the beginning?  I was ignored for around 5 minutes as the guys behind the counter were talking to each other, and I was clearly in view.  I probably should have left, but like I said, if the food is good, I&#39;m willing to put service aside.  This was not the case.

They toast the buns for their burgers on the grill, same for the gyro bread. They even crisp up the gyro meat on a flat top before serving it. Fries are perfect. Crispy but soft inside and not greasy. Contrary to other reviews I&#39;ve always enjoyed their hot dogs, but then again, when I order a hot dog that&#39;s all I expect. Not sure what everyone else expects out of ordering a hot dog.

So, good quality food and a solid serving size.

The staff here is always good to me as well. The guys are polite, have never messed up an order, and the place is always clean. In this type of establishment that is HUGE to me.

I got the 2 hot dog special last night for my daughter because she insisted on hot dogs and fries and Big Sammy&#39;s was the closest place and I didn&#39;t feel like driving any further.  I got the bag of food (2 dogs with everything and fries) and it weighed like a half pound.  Most other places when you order the same thing the bag weighs at least a pound.  Their hot dogs are small, their fries are small, and their prices are high.

Go somewhere else."

The plain buns are like fluffy pillows.  The small wieners are skinless and overcooked but the condiments are applied properly.

I ordered the daily special, which was crispy chicken fingers with fries and a drink.  I was going to order a hot dog, but saw their sign boasting how crunchy and juicy their chicken strips were.  I&#39;m a total sucker for advertisements.

The chicken strips were seasoned well, crunchy, and very moist.  They have a few dipping sauce choices and went with some hot sauce &amp; honey mustard.  The honey mustard was really good, with a creamy mayo-based consistency.  The fries weren&#39;t anything special.

The service was quick, interior was clean, and they have cheap daily deals.  I&#39;ll be back for sure whenever I feel like some chicken strips and maybe try some of their bbq."

The dogs are good, fries tasty. The food isn&#39;t going to blow you away, but it&#39;s a hot dog place. The specials are good to snag 2 dogs, fries and a drink for $5. I saw a review about their soda machine and will agree. I had root beer and the ratio must be off.

Never paid much attention to it despite having past it a hundred times.  Last night we were hungry on the way home from mom&#39;s in Roselle.  Guy behind the counter was nice, and bragged about their food.  Sorry I can&#39;t say I agree.

I had a steak sand that sarted off OK, but the last part of the steak was inedible - hard.  Not even chewy - couldn&#39;t bite it.  I don&#39;t think a dog could have chewed it.  Guy @ the counter suggested my wife order the veggie burger, said it was &#34;great, not like the other places&#34; (or soemthing like that).  It was NOT GOOD.  Just out of a freezer, nothing special.  BLAH.  We should have toosed our food and gone some place we know to be good.

Overall a complete disappointment.  They get an extra star for being nice.  Their food is terrible.

A clue that we should have walked out was all the ads on the walls for products supplied them by various purveyors.  Chili, soup, sides, etc.  Pretty much everything is bought frozen from Sysco or some place, then tossed on the grill or in the fryer.   Nothing is fresh.  I guess I just expect more from the little places.

I won&#39;t return."

If I had been paying attention on the way driving to this dump, I would have noticed there is a Steak and Shake close by.

Always liked the pork sandwich here and this time was no exception.  Tasty and tender.  Hot dogs are consistently good...typical dogs.

We carried out, but waited for our food inside.  Seating area is kind of small, but it&#39;s clean and they have a TV to keep you entertained.  We didn&#39;t have to wait long, even though there were 2 people ahead of us in line.  We waited less than 10 minutes for all our food.

I got here a little before noon and it wasn&#39;t too crowded at the time. As I waited for my food though, it was a different story as there were a ton of people lined up.

The hotdog was average which confuses me. The sign states &#34;Big Sammy&#39;s Hot Dogs&#34; so I would think that their hotdogs would be above average, if not superior to other hot dog joints. Dog had your typical tomato, mustard, onion and I think relish. The weird thing was it had one of those flat stacker pickles, not a regular spear like most hotdogs. I love pickles so I still ate it! Oh, and no sesame seed bun, just a plain ol bun that you can buy at Jewel. And, no celery salt which a lot of &#34;Chicago Style&#34; hotdogs have.

The fries were pretty good. I noticed that they weren&#39;t too greasy which was a plus. My order was to go and they did give me ketchup packets (another yelper mentioned that you had to pump your own ketchup). 

I also ordered the beer battered mushrooms. I love breaded/fried mushrooms...these, not so much. I am not a fan of beer (shocking, I know) and these tasted very strongly of beer. You are probably thinking, &#34;then why did you order beer battered mushrooms, stupid&#34;...I&#39;m thinking the same thing. I&#39;ve had many &#34;beer battered&#34; items before and you can never really taste beer but these shrooms must have had an overnight beer bath because they were kicking. They do charge extra for ranch sauce.

I may try Sammy&#39;s again for lunch but I definitely won&#39;t get a hotdog as it wasn&#39;t anything special."

So my girlfriend took me here down the street from her house and boy was I surprised. Big Sammys opened up not too long ago so was a new place to try and convince me the suburbs had a decent gyro spot. It did not disappoint. First they give you a large portion that is worth the price of the meal. That&#39;s rare with smaller food chains but the actually give you the bang for your buck. Second most gyro spots in the burbs try to imitate the city but not here. Its  there own kind of gyro that makes it unique from all the other spots out in the suburbs. Big Sammys is really a pleasant surprise.

This past weekend my husband &amp; I hosted an all out &#34;Tropical Pool Party&#34; in our home where we catered/served an array of Caribbean food to our attending 50+ guests. Prior to the party we had diligently searched around  for local restaurants to cater our main dishes - we were trying to avoid ordering from the inner city usual locations and wanted to support local suburban businesses. And I must say we are so glad we did. 

We ordered Jamaican &amp; Puerto Rican cuisines from two separate restaurants and I must say they both delivered Exceptional Dishes. 

1) Montego Bay Restaurant &amp; Grill - Bellwood, IL 
We ordered a medium tray of Jerk Chicken &amp; a medium tray of Jamaican Rice &amp; Beans. I had initially called in to place an order for just the rice &amp; beans, then personally visited that same evening and ended up ordering the jerk chicken as well. 
Mr. Curtis was extremely nice and very attentive &amp; helpful  to us while deciding on the portion sizes for the amount of guest were were expecting. During this time there were 2 other younger gentlemen behind the counter attending customers and I could not help but notice how respectful, polite and courteous they were (oddly we don&#39;t see that very often from the younger generation working in restaurants) Much respect for that!! 

O.M.G.!!!! The portions in these trays were so much more than expected - I can only imagine how much food comes in a large tray. The food was absolutely delicious, the rice &amp; beans was amazing, cooked just right with  lots of flavor &amp; seasoning - I could not stop eating the rice, it is so good that you can eat it alone. The BBQ&#39;d Jerk Chicken was cooked to perfection, full with aromatic &amp; smoky flavors, extremely juicy with an awesome Jamaican kick to it - the taste just filled your mouth with delight. We were also provided with extra jerk sauce to add to the chicken - that sauce was &#34;Fire in a bottle&#34; and although it was spicy it had you wanting more. Our guest were completed delighted with the Jamaican food as many had never had it before. Mr Curtis - Thank you so much for catering your delicious food for our Tropical party. We will definitely be back for more. 

2) Santiago&#39;s Puerto Rican Restaurant Sabores Latinos Inc. - Des  Plaines, IL
We ordered a large tray of Pernil (roasted pork), Medium tray of Maduros (fried plantains) &amp; a tray of Pastelillos (fried meat pies). First off, my husband (who picked up the food) said the Pernil smelled so good in the car on the way home that he was tempted to pull over to eat some. 

Again, the portions were much more than expected which is a big Plus when catering for an event. The pernil was extremely juicy and flowing with flavor, the seasoning was perfect, the pernil was cut up into nice sized portions  - just what you expect for a great tasting pernil. We were provided in a separate tray with the cuero (pork skin) which was crisped to perfection  (that we saved for our enjoyment the next day...LOL).  I am guessing and totally speculating that the pastelillos (fried meat pies) were absolutely delicious because they went so fast I didn&#39;t get a chance to have one but the guest sure made it a point to tell me how delicious they were as they were savoring the taste. The maduros (fried plantains) were a big hit as well, after all who doesn&#39;t like fried plantains to compliment a nice piece of pernil/ Right?!?!! 
Santiago&#39;s I must  say you provided some Absolutely Delicious Food!! 

In addition your attention to detail &amp; customer service is exceptional, the fact that Mr. Santiago called me the following day after our event to see how everything went and if the food meet our expectations is by far going above and beyond for your customers satisfaction. That was completely priceless!!!

Thank you once again Mr. Curtis from Montego Bay Restaurant &amp; Grill and Mr. Santiago &amp; his beautiful wife Marisol from Santiago&#39;s Puerto Rican Restaurant for providing our guests with an ultimately delightful cuisine experience that I am certain will be 
talked about for a long time to come. 

I wish both of these restaurants much success &amp; prosperity!! Many Blessings!!!"
santiagos-des-plaines-2,Miss D.,1YYurgfPyaSgI1lOuB7zsQ,"Elmwood Park, IL",0,1,0,0,321,BMuDUXDwuiex5fH4QlgyQg,1.0,2016-11-09,"I REALLY wanted to love this place, I really did. It&#39;s disheartening to have to write this review but I feel it is necessary so that people who have families and have busy lives do not waste their time.

Firstly, the food is good. No complaints in that department. What I don&#39;t like is that my family and I have wasted time driving to Santiago&#39;s (during business hours) and they&#39;re closed. Very poor business practice and rather unprofessional. We let it slide and never even brought it up on one too many occasions but tonight, we just had enough.

Since we&#39;ve made multiple visits in the past (6-8 roughly) where they should be open but for whatever reason they&#39;re &#39;closed&#39;, we decided today to call hours ahead to make sure they weren&#39;t closing early or closed in general. We call 3 hours ahead of time and ask the owner what time they close. She stated &#34;8pm&#34;. Wonderful! I, being weary because we&#39;ve had so many issues regarding driving there to find out they&#39;re &#39;closed&#39;, decided to call in my order at 7:35pm. No one picks up and we called atleast 6 times.... At this point, we really don&#39;t care about how good the food is or how nice the staff is, this is inconsiderate to customers ESPECIALLY when we called 3 hours ahead of time to make sure we&#39;d make it before they close. And you close earlier anyway. They have caller ID. At the very least, CALL the customer who you told you&#39;d be open til 8pm and let them know you&#39;re closing earlier, again. I get you have a family but so do the rest of your customers. We&#39;d like to manage our time just as efficiently as you do yours so when you tell us you&#39;d be open til 8pm and that&#39;s what we planned for our family dinner yet you close earlier, it just shows me that you have no regard or consideration for your customers. And as good as your food is, it&#39;s not worth all the hassle of trying to plan around your wavering &#39;business hours&#39;. 

Consistency is key and this establishment is lacking. We shouldn&#39;t have to call EVERY SINGLE TIME we want to dine in or order out. Business hours are there for a reason. I honestly don&#39;t even know why you have business hours to begin with when you hardly ever adhere to them.

I&#39;ve ranted and raved to family and friends about your food and recommended it to everyone. Can&#39;t say I&#39;d do that anymore. Last visit we had there you closed early and when we left, a gentleman walked up to your restaurant and disappointingly shook his head. He told us he was from out of town and that someone recommended this place to him. That night was his 2nd attempt but left in disappointment because he also has wasted 2 visits since you closed earlier than what your business hours state.

This review is not intended to bash Santiago&#39;s. It is more of a duty I feel is necessary to make to the public so that they are aware that although they&#39;re craving that Jibarito or what have you, that they may just be wasting their time just as we have TOO many times. Gas isn&#39;t cheap and time is valuable. Please take that into consideration when you decide to close earlier than what your business hours indicate.

Please either change your hours completely or don&#39;t have them at all. It&#39;s very frustrating. And I&#39;m sure if this consistently happened to you and your family while trying to plan a family dinner, you&#39;d be just as disappointed. Please be more considerate of your customers and their time. We are just as busy with our own lives as you are with yours and this is nothing short of a HUGE inconvenience and disappointment.

Sincerely,
A Once Loyal Customer"

I found it where else on Yelp.  As I was coming back towards Sweet Home Chicago I was hungry (so what else is new). I looked on Yelp for something on my return path what should I see, but Santiago&#39;s a 4 1/2 star Puerto Rican Restaurant.  

I was in a rush as I had another meeting scheduled so I grabbed some food on the fly.  The shredded pork carnitas  looked delicious.  I ordered this with Puerto Rican rice and red beans.  They gave me a very generous portion.  Ummm ummmm excellent choice.  I scarfed down about half of the serving and figured tomorrow is another day.  

If I&#39;m ever in the area again I plan on going back and trying some of the other dishes and dining in a more leisurely way.  The one dish I had was very good"

Be prepared to wait a long time for your freshly made food (like 40 minutes), or better yet, call well in advance if you already know what you want.  The interior is not big, but nicely decorated and there is some seating available.  It seems like a lot of the proprietors&#39; friends and family members like to hang out here, which frankly I think is nice.  That&#39;s how a real family-owned business should be.  

We chose to bring our food back home with us since the six of us felt too cramped in the restaurant and the music, while peppy and thematic, was a bit too loud.

I had the steak jibarito.  I had never had a jibarito before, and now that I can check it off my bucket list, I don&#39;t think I would order that again.  It was just TOO much for me, with the fried plantains, plus the steak, plus the tomato, onions, and especially the MELTED CHEESE.  I split this dish with my sister (and it was certainly big enough to do so), and she hates mayo so we didn&#39;t get that, hence some calories were saved.  If you are a fan of messy, over-the-top, calorific foods, you will probably like this.  My brother-in-law devoured his jibarito and practically licked up the crumbs, so surely they are doing this dish right.  And if you already know you like jibaritos, they have a variety of different types available so I&#39;m sure this will be a worthwhile stop for you.

My mom got the beef stew, which was awesome.  We also got the rice, which was equally good; they use some kind of tasty spice to season it and that really made it outstanding.

We got tostones (fried plantain) as a side.  This was similar to what was already on my jibarito.  Next time I&#39;d probably go for the maduros (sweet plantain).

The highlight of this outing was probably the pasteles (Puerto Rican tamale).  My mom LOVES pasteles, and used to get them homemade all the time from a former co-worker.  My mom has since been on the hunt for a good one, and with the first bite of Santiago&#39;s pasteles she proclaimed how dangerous it was to have this place so close to home, because now she will have access to great pasteles all the time!  The only glitch was that Santiago&#39;s forgot to give us our pasteles in our to-go bag, so we had to drive back after we were done eating our main course to pick them up.  Luckily it was all worth it!

The food here is really good and the family seems very nice, so I am hopeful that the efficiency of the restaurant will increase over time.  Either way I strongly recommend a visit, and I am sure that my family will become repeat customers."

The staff is very friendly as well.  I live about 45mins from Des Plaines but my husband works out there so we order from there from time to time.  My last visit I ordered the Lechon dinner &amp; when I got home I noticed they had forgotten the lechon!  I only had the arroz con gandules.  When I called to notify them of their mistake, the owner was very, very apologetic.  I explained to her that I lived far &amp; wasn&#39;t able to return right away but would be heading back out that way to pick up my husband from work at 11pm. She went above &amp; beyond to make sure I received a new dinner, with some soda too, even though they would be closed at that time.  Then she called me the next day to make sure I received my dinner &amp; that I was satisfied.  I thought that was very thoughtful of her!  That is great customer service &amp; is greatly appreciated!  I highly recommend them, not only for the food, but for the service.  Wells done Santiago&#39;s!!"

I recently went back and ordered the same dish which was the lechon dinner.  I was very disappointed, the meat was dry and over cooked  with meat juice over it.  I asked for some skin and OMG I could not believe what she gave me.  It was a black, burnt piece of skin that was so bitter.  I kid you not, I threw it in the garbage.  It was nasty.  I could never serve anyone something like that.  I was pissed because the food is not cheap.  I will not be coming back.  You might have a different experience though.  Try the place out for yourself."

There were a few tables in the place and in the background was Latin music. As you approach the front you can actually see the different types of dishes they serve in warming trays behind a glass pane. Their menu board is handwritten. At the time we were there they ran out of there to go menus. Basically you place your order upfront and seat yourself and they will serve your meal. They serve fountain drinks and we ended up getting Horchata. It was refreshing and really sweet you can definitely taste the cinnamon. We both ordered the beef steak and onions with Puerto Rican rice which has bits of pork in it and we ordered a side of sweet fried plantains. The plantains was enough for us to share. Crispy on the outside and nice soft and sweet on the inside. Serving portions were pretty good the beefsteak was not at all tough and chewy but perfect that I was able to separate it with my butter knife and fork. There was a little sauce that I soaked my rice with really tasty I would get this dish again. The one thing that we didn&#39;t like was that we found a couple of pork bones in the rice. I&#39;m sure that made it flavorful but you have to be careful not to chip a tooth.
The staff was friendly and they also asked us how was our meal.
Overall a nice experience I will definitely come back again because we don&#39;t have a good Puerto Rican restaurant around us unless we go into the city."

I&#39;m a big fan of Café Central in the city and have never found anything close to it.  My favorite meal is arroz blanco con habichuela y bistec encebollado (white rice and beans (kindey) and steak with onion).  This is a meal that my grandmother and mother have made and for me, is a staple of growing up Puerto Rican.  

First, they weren&#39;t open on time, but they explained what happened and so I didn&#39;t let that discourage me.  I was willing to wait for food while another customer came in to get a jibarito.  The other customer really got me excited since they had food there already and they were a big fan.  

So I got my plate, took it home to not let customer service or friendliness or anything impact my meal.  Let&#39;s just say that no pictures could be produced because the minute I smelled and tasted it, I couldn&#39;t stop from digging in.  Once I started, I could not stop.  The food took me back to growing up....I&#39;m extremely happy this is in DP!

As for customer service, the cook in the back and the lady at the counter (assuming husband and wife combo) were awesomely friendly.  It isn&#39;t a walk in order your food and go, people here are willing to have a conversation with you.  Love the vibe of the place, the service, the food...would love to go and take my wife for some good PR food.  Would love if they did some catering!"

You mean, I don&#39;t have to drive to Humboldt Park through the Kennedy traffic??? This place is so cute with the Puerto Rican paintings on the wall, the domino table set up, and the lively salsa music playing in the background. I was a little apprehensive about this place because the previous restaurants in this space did not do so well. However, the food was delicious! I loved the jibarito de bistec and the relleno de papa. The steak was juicy on crisp garlicky plantains and the potato mash ball was soft and filled with a delicious meat mixture. I especially loved the pique on the tables. The flavor brought me back to my visits to Puerto Rico. The mofongo was so flavorful, one of the best flavored mofongos I&#39;ve had, but the temperature could have been warmer. The alcapurias was delish and the pastelillo was just okay. The ground beef in the pastelillo was a bit overcooked, but I would definitely try it again to see if that was just a one time thing. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the morcilla and the pasteles. Yes! They have pasteles! If you never had Puerto Rican food, you should definitely try this place out!"

Went there yesterday with a good friend that&#39;s PR and I&#39;m Cuban. We&#39;ve both lived in our respective islands, been spoiled by great food made by our moms and replicated by the numerous quality Latino restaurants in Chicago. Having said that, this place is not good. 

The place is small, a little musty, service was mediocre at best, and the food was sub par. We ordered the arroz con gandules, pernil and a side of maduros. Thank God my buddy caught the server trying to dump the juice from the pernil on the rice. Wtf??? Who does that to rice? The actual meat had no flavor, seemed undercooked and smelled foul. I ate the maduros and the rice, but threw away the meat. 

For the people that live in the area this is probably a good restaurant, but make no mistake about it, this place is NOT authentic PR food."

Very moist and abundant in serving portion sitting in its own juices. Every bite was delicious. The pernil dinner came with a side of Arroz con gandules which was tasty but it was a bit dry. It was probably because we went 10 minutes before closing. My wife had a steak sandwich which was also moist and delicious. The horchata wasn&#39;t the same as I had at Mexican  restaurants but it still satisfied.

Definitely will come back."

I was glad they finally opened a puerto rican restaurant close to work. As a Trained chef and foodie, I also, work part time in the food industry i didnt care for their alcapurrias -fried dumplings or thier relleno de papa-stuff potatoes with meat., it was over seasoned and burnt.  My other coworkers didn&#39;t care for their meal either. The horchata was,horrible, and the pastry had too much filo dough and not enough filing  While you provide good customer service !
Your establishment needs structure, like answer phones that is what is advertised on your menu for take out.  People stationed  where the need to be in order to have everything run smoothly.

Grew up in Humboldt park and then moved to northern suburbs a few years ago. The move was the hardest because all my favorite places to eat at in the city are now an hour away. Enter Santiagos! I now have a DELICIOUS PR restaurant a short drive away from my house. I went on a Friday night and they were very busy. Always a good sign. Ordered pastele, alcapuria, jibarito de bistec and lechon dinner with a side of kidney beans. The flavors were all SPOT on from my childhood. The food was hot, and fresh! The service was amazing. Truly a family joint that welcomes you into their Puerto Rican Household. And after the doors closed and we were still eating, the workers all made themselves a plate of food, and all sat down together and are together enjoying each other&#39;s company. Another person (assuming family member not in uniform) came in after closing and made a plate and joined everyone else. This is a hidden gem, and furthermore it&#39;s this small family business that I love to support!! I enjoyed their pastele so much I bought a dozen frozen!

All their food is prepared fresh and full of flavor. I have tried many things on the menu and have to say all taste great. Would recommend to anyone wish they stayed open a little later but that&#39;s ok. Great Puerto Rican food at a great price. To many more visits here!

The only food I know that is Puerto Rican is Jibarito.  So i ordered that and was surprised that they also have lechon which is the same food back home. The place looks new and clean. The people are friendly. For the dinner it already pre-made and it is on the see through counter. The sandwiches are made to order. The service was fast enough. They just need to organize on how to take orders and pay and get food. The food smells delicious. My jibarito is awesomrly yummy. The plantain outside is crispy, thr steak is thinly sliced and tender. Everything that is inthere is tasty and i love te taste of garlicwhich is just the right amount. The lechon is good too. They serve it with rice and beans but you can order it as appetizer for $6/lb. definitely will be back"

Her and I went to Santiago&#39;s for the first time together and found our experience a little different from everyone else&#39;s. 

I&#39;m used to the Puerto Rican restaurants in Chicago and was recommended to visit Santiago&#39;s by a friend. Our friend found their lunch menu to be perfect as she expected. 

We went to visit for dinner and was greeted by who seems to be the owner/manager. We looked at the menu and knew exactly what to order. Unfortunately it took us almost 10 minutes to even place an order because of the people coming in after us that we&#39;re getting served before us.. Not sure how that happened. We made eye contact with the girl leaning against the wall by the register to take our order but she walked away.. Eventually after standing in front of the register we were greeted by the owner/manager again who asked the same girl who walked away from us to place our order. She walked away again and another girl took our order. After we placed our order we were instructed to have a seat and to wait for our food. My girlfriend and I were a little confused because of how different the ordering process was for us compared to how we&#39;re used to in the city. The same girl who took our order dropped off our food and checked up on us throughout our visit. At the end we grabbed our plates and since we paid in advance we left. Don&#39;t get me wrong the food was awesome and the restaurant was as I expected. Had a great Puerto Rican atmosphere. I understand every restaurant is different and I plan to visit this restaurant again. 

Pro: The food was rich in flavor and was really good. The restaurant was clean and the manager was very attentive. Food time and portion was good. 

Con: Seems there were a lot of employees but not enough service. I felt the person who I approached at the register could have taken my order without walking away. I was also asked to grab my own food when the tables next to us were served by someone."

So I decided to try it out. I heard it gets really busy during lunch time so We went around 1:30pm. It&#39;s a nice small, friendly place. The young girl who took our order was very friendly and polite. I ordered the arroz with gandules and an alcapurria , I have tried better but this is still good puerto rican food. I will definitely come back . I need to try the jibarito. The only thing I would recommend is that they have a better system when people order , because I witnessed them trying to figure out who ordered what,  because it started getting a little busy."

Really wanted to try the jibarito but was told that the wait would be about 45 minutes (I couldn&#39;t wait as I was there on my lunch break). The waitress recommended the lechon dinner said it&#39;s a popular item also I wouldn&#39;t have to wait since it was already prepared. I went for it and also ordered a relleno de papa and alcapurria along with a pastelillo de guava for dessert. After waiting over 35 minutes I finally received my order. The relleno de papa had a weird taste, the alcapurria was dry, the lechon was too salty also the pastelillo didn&#39;t have enough guava. The one good thing I have to say is the staff was friendly even though they were very disorganized and they kept getting friends name wrong! If I do go back I will try the jibarito as a fellow coworker said it was good."

Also, we ordered a jibarrito which is a steak sandwich with plantains as the pieces of bread. That was so good and we ordered the tostones and Maduros.

If the place opens at 10 some frituras should already be ready. Jibaritos should not be made with American Cheese. The food needs a lot more flavor.

First time I went just so happen to be good Friday. They were closed, I was bummed because it&#39;s not an official holiday for business&#39;s but whatever. Went  a second time, ordered a jibarito &amp; side of rice. They explained they ran out of rice! Who runs out of rice? That just tells me, that no one is truely paying attention to the establishment &amp; it&#39;s needs. I waited 30min for my jibarito&#39;s, with no rice to be done within that time. I was never given my drinks I paid for. I had to ask for them. The girl giggled with a &#34;OMG I forgot!&#34; Look on her face. They had prob like 4-5 young employees in the business shirts &amp; hats but not working what&#39;s so ever. They were lounging around, just talking. Maybe they were on break. Not sure but All Tables were dirty, full of empty plates just sitting as they all talked. Mind me, it was only me &amp; 1 other couple in the whole joint. Finally got my Sandwhich, which was decent but it wasn&#39;t the same with no rice. I insisted to my boyfriend he must try the food with the full experience of the Puerto Rican rice! I convinced him to go again. We walked in a lil after 7:00, it was an hour before close (so the door states) and I order the same thing. So they inform me the kitchen is closed! I can only order whatever was already cooked. Are you kidding me? My boyfriend said he&#39;s done with this place! So today, 04/29/2016. I said ok! I&#39;m giving them another chance! I&#39;m going to phone in my order &amp; just pick up to bring to him! I call, no one answers. I keep getting busy signals. I try again &amp; I finally hit a voicemail saying that they are closed due to going to Minnesota for their daughters volleyball competition. What kind of inconsistent business is this? You can clearly tell that this is a first time experience running a business cuz they are doing a horrible job! It&#39;s a little hole in the wall business with a not so clean looking inside. The one sandwhich I tried was good. I never got to try anything else due to all these obstacles. I&#39;ve never written a Yelp review &amp; for this I felt I def had to! Maybe I just have bad luck but I have given this place one too many tries. No longer waisting my time! I&#39;ll just drive to humbolt park for good Puerto Rican food, I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t ever deal with situations like these over there!"

4 adults and 3 little kiddos were on our way to Santa&#39;s Village on a Sunday afternoon and decided to fill up on some real food instead of the junk at the amusement park.  Having a hankering for Indian food, we settled on Thumka for the variety and speed factor.

The restaurant has absolutely zero wow factor, but the glorious buffet is what one comes for anyway.  Today&#39;s lunch buffet was full of EVERYTHING that was uber-delicious!  I can&#39;t personally say much for the vegetarian dishes, but from what I  could see, a couple in our party were enjoying theirs.  But my oh my, the meat options were ah-friggin-mazing!  There was the always-present tandoori chicken, hot and flavorful.  But let&#39;s move to the curries: lamb, butter chicken, achari chicken, and a catfish curry...I just couldn&#39;t get enough!  Hats off to the chef, because everything listed above, plus the raita and the desserts were off the hook!

I feel as though this Indian spot will appear more to the ethnic palate. Don&#39;t expect your Americanized, diluted down versions here.  The spices are spicier and packs a stronger punch than from other Indian places I&#39;ve dined at. And that&#39;s not in a bad way!  In that sense, i feel that dishes here lean more authentic, and for the Indian-food-familiar crowd.

Ordered to go.  Chicken tikka masala/butter chicken. Sauce was flavorful. Thicker than what I&#39;m used to (chunkier, not creamier), and darker, rather than the creamy-sweet I&#39;m used to having. It was pretty flavorful, and the chunks of chicken were hearty. (In a Thai food analogy, more red curry than panang).

My friend ordered the chicken vindaloo. Also really delicious, and definitely deserved to be ordered on the spicy side. 

We opted out of the plain basmati rice. I had the basmati with mushrooms, since I&#39;m a mushroom fanatic. These slices were hearty. She had the basmati rice with cumin, although I didn&#39;t try it.

We also added in an order of buttered naan bread. I&#39;m used to garlic naan, which is pretty flavorful.  However, this naan&#39;s flavoring leans more on the mild side, and can be lost when eaten with the flavor-infused entrees. by itsself i notice its faint essence more, but... overall, it can be easily forgettable. Also on the thinner, burnt side. May not order the naan again, and instead try roti on a different go."

On entering, it is impressive. Very modern, clean, with linens, and wall treatment that reflects the Indian motif. A video of Indian pop music plays quietly on the TV.

The service was very slow. We came in just after opening for the evening, and there was only one other occupied table. It took over 30 minutes for our food order to arrive. I&#39;m not sure if there was a delay putting it in, or some problems with the kitchen. We did come in upon opening, so maybe they were not set up yet. And there was a mix up on one of the dishes, which came blazing hot-spicy. The waiter spoke very softly and we often had trouble understanding him. We did go over the spiciness of the 3 dishes when the order was taken, but this dish was very hot instead of mild. They no-costed the $8 beer and apologized. 

Our chicken biryani was OK, very mild flavored. We have had tastier. Our spice-loving diner will try to dilute the high-heat spinach saagwala when using up the take home. The goat curry was good, and moderately spiced. We expected it would be the hottest thing on the table. Servings are very large: the biryani in particular was immense. The take-homes would not fit in 3 boxes.

They serve Indian beers (incl Hayward 5000), which are in a league of their own. I recommend them. The menu offers a long list of dishes, and nearly all are offered vegan or egg, and for added cost, chicken, goat, lamb or shrimp, and at various spiciness.

We may have hit an off time for Thumka, but our original high impressions were not representative of our overall experience."

However, in the past 3 months, we have tried to dine here on three different Saturday&#39;s only to find out the restaurant is closed for a private party. We don&#39;t live in the area, and drive past many great restaurants to get to Thumka and we are always super disappointed to see it closed. 

We are now searching for a new Indian restaurant to dine at that either has a private room for parties so their restaurant won&#39;t be closed to the public, or perhaps an Indian restaurant that has an updated webpage so the customer (me) knows it will be closed before driving all the way out there."

That is meant as a high compliment. 

Comfortable, friendly, no frills tables and booths with non-descript Bollywood playing on T.V.

Pakora&#39;s and chats are nice..Samosas, onion and potato pakoras, make your own bhel puri and pani puri.

Very nice and varied selection of main dishes -goat curry, chicken curry, butter chicken, 3 types of rice and biryani, channa masala and mixed lentil dal all had nice flavors and did not lack for spice (heat). 

Tandoori chicken was good quality and tasted good but suffered from being covered up and steamed so it lacked that nice dry outer texture that comes from the tandoori oven-like a dry barbecue. 

Desserts were good..Kheer was especially nice. 

Choose your own Naan is a nice touch. I chose plain-a little dry but still very good. Could have used a brush of ghee. 

Overall a nice experience and very good value."

The service was pretty good about filling our water and clearing our plates.  We found out that the buffet does not include naan, so we added two pieces of naan.. because Indian food is not the same without it!

The buffet was just okay.  There were quite a few options, but the food just wasn&#39;t; that great.  It tasted powdery like everything came from a mix.  I did not have much of an appetite after the first round of food.

The food tastes really good and authentic although a little on the spicier side. But hey.. That&#39;s what good Indian food is supposed to be. The buffet has the most options that I have seen in Chicagoland area. And their bread menu is huge!! Both vegetarian and non vegetarian options are really good.

Nothing too great, but not revoltingly bad either. We generally avoid buffets like the plague. Usually the buffets have stuff sitting out there for long time, rice is dry and in general the quality of food is sub par. We landed here on a Saturday night, we didn&#39;t have a choice but to take the buffet. It was ok... there was a variety of dishes, vegetarian and non vegetarian. I stuck to vegetarian mostly - the dal was tasty. The other dishes were ok. The best part about the buffet is their choice of bread. Usually, restaurants serve regular naan on the table. But Thumka gives you a whole menu of breads, that you can choose from, and it is made fresh to order. That, I thought was a nice touch. The service is nothing great, we had glasses empty on our table multiple times."

I went there in 2013 Feb and came out licking my fingers.  That time lunch buffet used to be $6.99 which has hiked now.
Oh my today I was utterly disgusted by the quality of food.
Quantity of appetizers has reduced. 
Yogurt was sour, felt like weeks old.
Kadhi was sour as well. Gulab jamun were made out of bad milk I think. Daal makhni tasted way too sweet. Only good things were paani of golgappa, the service and the naans. 
Its not worth it at all now.
Clearly those $13 of dinner buffet went to waste.

I don&#39;t understand how indian reviewers can possibly give this a good rating. We went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The buffet of course. The goat and lamb curries were like water. Not even salt in the samber. The rice dry. The buffet in general was dirty and if tandoori chicken doesn&#39;t get served on a sizzler plate...it&#39;s a fail. Desserts were just terrible ...gajjar ka halwa made with oil. Never going there again. Sticky floor. I felt gross afterward. Blaring news on the tv. Only good thing is the parking.

Signs on the windows are all about the buffet, but we have a 10 year old who likes the flavors of Indian food, just not the heat.  We asked if they have menu service and the waiter told us no, just buffet, which was a bummer, but we decided to see if we could locate something that would fit our daughter&#39;s heat-phobic palate.

I went up with her and picked out items that she usually likes at other restaurants (Chicken Makhani, Paneer Pasanda, and Tandoori Chicken).  Unfortunately all three had a high spice level- they were even spicy to me and, as such, were completely inedible to her.  My wife and I kept eating and promised her we&#39;d stop and make it up to her on the way home.

At this point, the manager came by and asked how everything was.  We told him about the spice level being so high and he said we could order off the menu and ask for particular spice levels.  We were both shocked and told him that the waiter said they didn&#39;t have menu service, he apologized for the confusion, brought us a menu and the waiter came by to take our daughter&#39;s order.  (Chicken Makhani, mild.)  When it came out, the manager apologized again and said he hoped she would like it.  She did - she said it was some of the best she has had and really liked the smoky flavor to the chicken and that the sauce was really creamy.

All the dishes on the buffet that I had were really good, but also really spicy, ot the point that, after a while, all I could taste was heat and the individual flavors of the dishes were lost in the flames.

Before we found out about the fact that they do have menu service, we vowed we wouldn&#39;t be back...but after finding out that they DO have menu service, we will be back and give them another try."

Good variety of naans, paratha, etc.  Salad was fresh.  Chutnies, both sweet and savory, were also good.  Tandoori chicken is always better if it comes to your table sizzling which it did not.
  Here are the &#34;no no&#39;s&#34;; Undercooked rice that actually crunched when bitten.  Bland sambhar, I think they forgot the salt.  And, as stated earlier, no one likes skimming through watered-down shorva and bones, desperately in search of a boti that ends up being bland.  There were dishes that deserved a thumbs up.

Priced at $11 and $12 for lunch and dinner resp, they always have a bread special meaning you can order any kind of naan/paratha, the bigger your group the more varieties of bread you can probably taste. I think the BEST place for chat items for sure and they do have a big array of choices.

Chat Items: 1. Samosa &amp; pakora.
2. Pani Puri -- This has to be made. For all the non-indians out here, who probably have not had this, you guys should make this. Its very simple to make. You have these small puri (small crunch oval shaped -- next to samosa/pakora), take some of those, make a small hole, with say like your thumb only on top of the puri, fill it with the POTATO (this is in the salad bar), then put the mint water in it [this is different from both the chutney - mint and tamarind, this is on the left of those two] and gobble the entire thing. You can probably google it if you want to see how they look. 
             Innovative items to make: 1. Having gone there a couple of times, I did get the idea that, we could also make SAMOSA CHANNA. So take the samosa (and pakora if you like those), crush them (if you want Indian style - just use your hand), put lot of channa masala , to cover the rest of bowl, then add both the red and green chutneys to it, you can add onion, tomato and small corriander leaves as garnish. It is by far the best thing that can be SELF-MADE on the menu.

Starters: Things that were good -- Chilli Chicken, Fish Pakora and the Chilli Babycorn (if you consider that as a starter)

Entrees: As far as they were concerned, I think everything was just ok.  The dal was good, paneer butter masala was good. butter chicken was just ok (it was good the first time I went, not the second time). 

Naan: Guess you could try something different always - Lachcha paratha was pretty good. 

Rice is also there, but I didnt take it.

Dessert: I think Gajjar halwa (Carrot halwa) and Payasam (Rice Pudding) were both good. But for my taste - Gajjar halwa would have been so much better if it was as sweet as Payasam. The gulab jamun was a let down both times. 

[ P.S. Anyone from restaurant seeing this, I would recommend the following : 
1. Please make the gajjar halwa a little more sweet
2. Gulab jamun more soft - which can be done by not letting it cook for as long as you have
3. Have instructions to make Pani Puri 
4. Tandoori Chicken has to be improved.
5. Please make butter chicken masala better, paneer masala and butter chicken masala should not be tasting the same way.
6. In my opinion, you can remove one of the main entrees, there are too many things and maybe put something similar to idli (I know you have this) - another solid item to eat is what I meant. ]

right out of the gate I got a giant samosa. I mean, baseball sized. That was awesome. 

There were several other very tasty entrees, mostly vegetarian. Oh except the butter chicken, which was very good. I&#39;m a big fan of the HOT food... none of this was but the flavors were great so I didn&#39;t mind. 

In the middle of all this, they brought out some naan and a sizzling cast iron plate of chicken with fresh white onion and lemon slices from somewhere in the back. Yum. Free refills on that awesome sizzling chicken too. Very cool.

The place was not that crowded, maybe four or five other tables of people on their lunch break....I hope they have enough business to stay open for a while. Staff was very nice and attentive at the right times.

I got a diet coke that tasted flat/strange and cost me $2. That was probably the only thing I could really complain about."

They try and not let you know the same so they can keep the original clientele but to me that was very deceiving. The food is way different than what original Thumka owners served. I don&#39;t think I am ever going back.


I usually don&#39;t review places we eat at, but this place made me sign up with Yelp!
May I start by saying, that there is no one form of Indian food but several depending on the regions it comes from/how it is cooked. Thumka serves north Indian food, and is very close to what you would find at various restaurants back in India. 
Few things on why we love Thumka:
1. The main course dishes,(like dal makhani and paneer) always taste the same, every time we go. 
2. The number of dishes on his buffet is good for the price charged compared to other Indian restaurants in nearby area.
3. Not just the main course, but his appetizers(samosas, chaat, pakodas) always taste fresh and are really good. Oh, did I mention the pani puri (gol gappe) is AHMAZING!?!
4. My MIL  loves the desserts here, especially Gajar Halwa.
5. I really like how many different types of Naan&#39;s are offered.

My husband is a vegetarian but just by looking at the meat items I can tell they are good too.

 Things that can be improved:
1. Idli and sambhar? They just don&#39;t taste good here.
2. Service? It&#39;s a little on the slower side

Nothing else to complain. It takes a lot for a restaurant to bring me and my husband back, but Thumka serves the Best dal makhani and paneer in Schaumburg area, amongst all the places we have tried. We come here a lot often, for these two items, oh and Gol Gappe!

Must try!!"

We were both taken by surprise- it is by far the best Indian food we have had anywhere in America. The best part being that each dish had its own unique flavor- (usually a lot of indian restaurants will end up using the same gravy for more than one dish)
We loved everything we ate there and also made sure we told the owner (a very pleasant man ) that the food was great! I will definitely recommend this restaurant for its food.

LOCATION
Tucked in the Barrington Square Mall, a little deeper in past the old Garibaldi&#39;s Pizza location... 

VIBE
I would agree that the initial ambiance is not particularly impressive... tables amd chairs are hokey, and all the taped up signs are not helping. Menu has blatant typos. Am I a pedantic spelling sheriff for getting annoyed? *SHRUGS*

SERVICE
Accomodating if not the most smooth or professional, the initial waiter on Friday was non-Desi and had NO clue about the menu. Lame! After like 5 &#34;Let me ask...&#34; responses, we eventually got an informed one... and I told him the tip was for him alone.

FOOD
The food IS pretty good... even the initial basket of chips were extra spicy. 

Recommend ordering from the &#39;Appitizer&#39; section, as those are pretty substantial and come with naan or rice... for the same price range of the Entrees... which illogically, comes al a carte.

Thumka Sampler... Veg &amp; Non-Veg Tandoori is good... except that the fish portions included, were LITERALLY the size of a pair of dice. I asked what the dealio was, and the response was a sheepish grin and shrug.

C&#39;mon... seven.... ;-)"

I feel like they have just the prefect balance of &#34;spice&#34; and &#34;flavor&#34;. 

Their buffet food doesn&#39;t have that mass-produced taste that many of the other restaurants do. Also, a LOT more variety than any other indian restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to in the US. Something for everybody. Be it idlis, dosas, tandoori chicken, samosas, chana, daal, pulav, etc.

The staff is also friendly and competent. Which is very rare for indian restaurants.

In terms of decor/ambiance, its not like a fancy steakhouse but its definitely decent and well kept."

We do order from the menu from time to time but no matter what is on the plate, its delicious. My personal favorite is the Goat but I also ador the spiced cauliflower. Every single time we have been there is a steady crowd.

A previous review spoke about the wait staff in a negative manner. I have to say they have always been friendly and very attentive. One even let us take some Naan home (which is considered part of the buffett so the usual answer is no)

Let me start of saying, I got trapped into buying Groupon deal (should have read the reviews before buying it). Anyways, bought the groupon, went to Thumka with 6 people for dinner. One of the worse place to eat food. Service was terrible, lady/manager/server (only 1 person doing everything) didn&#39;t bring bread/naan on time, by the time I got my plate @ the table, I had to wait over 20 mins to get Naan. And when she brought the Naan, they weren&#39;t cooked well, it was very doughy, told her try one and she walked away. Their RICE was not cooked @ all, it tasted like it had been sitting in the same pan for days. Their desert was the worse, I believe it was rice pudding/kheer but had the taste of burned milk in it. The server only came once to our table to fill up the glass (water). @ the end, when I asked for the check, ofc it came with over $16 something included on the bill as a TIP for her. Called groupon and complained about it but they told me that I should have read reviews about it before buying the groupon deal."

It was a wednesday night and as we parked our car and started walking towards the restaurant in the strip mall, we began to regret our decision for choosing Thumka.
The restaurant is almost not visible from the front of the mall strip, just the name shows and is cornered to the side next to a hair saloon.
We entered and .......&#34;crickets&#34;......IT WAS EMPTY!!
They had a dinner buffet set up and we cringed..
For some reason our lazy behinds decided to give it a shot (It was freezing cold outside and no one wanted to take the effort to research another place).
I did not fancy the decor and ambiance. Open dining hall with tables spread out with some wall decor or paintings, not worth mentioning.

We summoned up all our courage and decided to go for it.

No Buffet for us....A la Carte

Spoke to the server to recommend a good indian beer. (While at an Indian restaurant ,why not try Indian alcohol). He suggested a light indian beer : Royal Challenge and a strong ale : Old Monk.
For appetizers we went with
Tandoori Sampler
Jhinga Lasooni

First off both the beers were different, can&#39;t compare to any american beer...but we freakin loved both of them. The old monk beer was either quite strong or we all were weaklings, gave all of us a slight kick.
The Royal Challenge beer was refreshing.
The tandoori sampler.....so well marinated and flavorful. Loved all of it. The fish and the meat.
The Jhinga Lasooni (Shrimp), this one had a nasty spice kick to it. All of us had a teary eyes and running noses...BUT....WE JUST COULD NOT STOP EATING IT.!! :) YUMMY SPICY....not for the weak stomach.

Second round of drinks...more beer!!

For the main course
Entrees
Sharabi Kababi Tikka Masala: This is supposed to be similar to the Indian Butter chicken but with a twist of brandy. I could not taste the brandy..not sure if they flambed it. Not anything like butter chicken. I&#39;d say this was good.
Konkan Prawn Masala: I expected a more coconut based dish as it is a &#34;Konkan&#34; prawn masala. I could not get those spices. Regardless very good.
Yellow Dal: Simple lentils with some tempering, not spicy just cooked right.

Breads
Nan, Roti, Laccha Parantha, Reshmi Parantha
Always loved these Indian breads baked in a clay oven. My pick was the Laccha Parantha with the layers.

The food we ordered was good enough for about 5 people, we were 4 so had a few left overs.
No desserts, were too stuffed.
Spoke to the server, who happened to be the owners brother, and commended the food. They happen to hail from Himachal Pradesh - Northern Part of India.

Give it a 3.5 stars....
Stellar food.....buck up your ambiance !! Service was good....but we were the only table that night :)"

We went for the dinner, dang they have a buffet, well we could order from the menu, but I have never seen this to work out well as in ordering from menu when they are serving buffet, so we went for the buffet.

Delicious Samosas, stunning Gajar Halwa (Carrot desert) took me back to Delhi, wow that you can get a real and fresh Paratha rather than a soggy Naan, The best Fish Pakora I have had outside of Amritsar, awesome Aloo Bhindi, Nice Indo Chinese Dish.  But Meat dishes looked stale and just bad.

Service:  Warm service, good location.  Owner personally stopped by and asked around people for their opinion, he cared.

My critique:  Place lacks ambiance.  Chairs are covered in some sort of a cloth, table cloth is a weird colored, water glasses are humungous, different size glasses on same table, water tasted bad, small things like this add up.  This is all very Delhi styled things I know, I grew up there but when going for a decent dinner, these things matter to me.

I will definitely go back and order from the menu next time."

Its very difficult to find this place because its located quite in the interior. The place looks small and its very easy to overlook. 

So, here we were to eat indian food. The staff was friendly and nice. We were in the mood of some nice bhajias (pakoras) so went ahead and ordered pakoras and our friends were extremely excited to have it because there aren&#39;t much indian restaurants in the place where they live. We were disappointed. The pakoras were very oily and they tasted okay. The veggies had too much batter coating. Next was the shami kabab which was good and tasty. This made my hubby &amp; me happy.

For the main course, our friends ordered paneer pasanda (they are vegetarians) and we ordered chicken saagwala. While our dish was okay, paneer pasanda seemed more like a dessert than an entree. While the description on the menu suggested it had mango gravy, we had expected it to be a little sweet. But, this was 100 times overly sweet and could be served as a dessert. Our friends were totally disgusted with their dish. They literally had to forcibly put it down their throats unwillingly because we didn&#39;t want to waste our money on this. 

For the dessert dish, the rasmalai was good. 

Our friends will definitely not come back here for sure. If you do visit this place, please stick strictly to the non-veg menu."

Waiter explained bread options and off we went to buffet.  Large array of selections but selections did not seem in order of dining experience, suggest the line up be looked at.  Soups were watery and very salty, very.  Salad selection was good with outstanding dressing/condiments. A bit disappointed in meat in sauce selections as the meat was minimal. Wanted to try the lamb but there honestly wasn&#39;t any piece of lamb to be located. Tandoori chicken was good. 

All that said, for this non-Indian diner, the service was great, atmosphere good and food OK.  We did use a groupon but would probably go back hoping that more protein was in the sauce!"

Most of the items are very salty or very sweet. In the buffet, there are so many variety of Naan breads, but they are of poor quality. For example when we ordered coriander Naan, they just gave a plain Naan with coriander sprinkled on it. it gives a poor and cheated feeling. Same goes for Chilli Naan. It would be great if they concentrate on just plain Naan and make it good. The buffet is not arranged in order. So, people not familiar with Indian food would not know the order.

My in-laws came to town wanting South Indian Cuisine,  when we got there, we were told they were out of dosa mix.  How do you run out of one of your major dishes.  

We had a Restaurant.com coupon and they would not honor it stating its only good from Mon- Thurs, even though its not specified anywhere on the coupon.

We served 2 curries, bread, appetizer and rice into the box. There were gulaab jamoons (dessert) which we wanted to pack separately; we asked for a smaller box, but this guy refused to  give us one. He said if he gave another box, he would consider it as 3 orders! Very surprised by his rude response, I asked him how would I carry out gulaab jamoons if I did not want to pay for the 3rd box (full price of carry out order just to pack a dessert).
He bluntly replied to make partition &#39;using&#39; the rice and pour the jamoon and sugar syrup in the middle (use rice as a water well).

Lastly, we had to wait a very long time to get our  check.    My advice is don&#39;t use a groupon, pay with cash, and eat all the bread you choose, even if you decide you don&#39;t like it. They need a course on good customer service.  It was totally not worth waiting the three hours for the restaurant to re-open, and the long drive we had to endure to reach the restaurant.  Ambiance and customer experience is the other half of a good dining experience.  I hope they improve, as they get their feet wet in the business, I know I will not recommend this place, to the many people I know, and I will never return myself.

Just scared that they might not be doing so well financially since there was no crowd. I can&#39;t go there often because I live in downtown Chicago so hope its still there when I go there again.

I had a chance to go to the buffet a couple more times. I honestly have to say they have maintained their quality consistently throughout. 

I did go one of their &#39;special/grand&#39; buffet which I think was only a dollar extra (from $8.99 to $9.99) but did noticeably have a lot more dishes. The day I went,  in addition to their traditional fare (of an already expansive menu) they did have mini uthappam , masala dosa, bhel poori (you have to make  your own with the chutneys, bhel etc). 

If you are in the mood for trying something new I would recommend their salt lassi. It has got its unique blend of mint,ginger and other spices. Perhaps more suited  to be enjoyed after a long summer day but a refreshing fare nevertheless."

We eat here as often as possible, usually at least once a week if not more!  The food is outstanding and the service is great! Everyone is really nice, humble and eager to serve you. We normally go to the lunch buffet which has an amazing variety of great food for under $10! The Grand weekend buffet is wonderful too! It is only $1 more than the weekday buffet, but includes more dishes and deserts. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting good high quality Indian food at a great price!"

I would definitely go back.  

The only drawback to that meal was it got very croweded and they were understaffed, so we had to wait a good bit of time before they refilled our water and brought our lassys out.  Other than that I would go back, just not on Mother&#39;s day.  lol"

Chicken tikka had 1/2 inch cubes of meat and they were chewy and hard. Tandoori chicken was also not fresh very blend.  Lamb was also very boring. Also Biriyani boring. All the meat items needs some new touch. I did loved the fresh Dosa they made and naan.

With tip I invested $6 on this lunch, a rather low risk gamble.  Well I kind of got what I paid for.  I went for the buffet, and like most buffets it was rather junkie.  They did make you fresh these two small portions of a whole chicken piece and a kabob type chicken.  Both of those were decent, but all in all,  this wasn&#39;t good.  These people were nice, I&#39;m not in the mood to massacre them too bad, but I know a 2 star place when I see it.  Maybe I should of just ordered a menu dish, but if they are serving up this buffet, then they are fair game to be judged on it.  I&#39;ll say something nice now, the naan bread was made fresh and very good.  They also have what looked like a full bar.  I saw about 8 Johnny Walker bottles sitting there ready to go.  So if you want to really blast off and drink some whiskey with naan bread, then I say go here."

We were there on Friday night.  -The service was attentive and good.  The food was just OK.  There are much better Indian buffets to be had in the Chicagoland area.  The buffet was a mixture of Indian food and Chinese food.  I was more interested in the Indian food.  The samosas were mini samosas and bit rubbery.  The butter chicken was good, but probably more sauce than chicken.  They didn&#39;t have a lot of vegetarian Indian choices.  They had a califlower dish which was OK.  No Saag Paneer.  The Galub Juman dessert had smaller mini balls (like the samosas) but were a bit crusty and not very tasty.  They also had a carrot dessert (which I&#39;ve had before at other places) which wasn&#39;t very tasty.  There wasn&#39;t any mango kulfi or rice pudding.  No Rogan Gosh either or Tandori chicken (the guy from Gaylord India tells me it isn&#39;t a buffet unless there&#39;s Tandori chicken.)  There weren&#39;t a lot of people, but a lot of buffet choices.  I always think that&#39;s a bad sign.  A good buffet keeps the food moving.  The more the food has to be replenished, the fresher it is.  Fewer options and more people usually results in a better buffet.  If food sits out under the sterno for too long, it affects the quality of the food.  I might be inclined to try this place for lunch or brunch if it were convenient (I don&#39;t work around there).  Friday night might not be the best time to visit this place.  For a better buffet, try Cuisine of India (Mt. Prospect / Naperville) or India House (Buffalo Grove / Downtown)."

Honestly the place is pretty damn good, it just has the unfortunate circumstance of being located less than a mile from a Mexican place that is absolutely superb in Cantarittos and it just does not measure up by comparison. That said, this place is a solid stop in for &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican food without question, and it&#39;s always nice to mix things up. 

While we are on the subject of the whole &#34;authentic&#34; thing, I am not sure if there is any actual measuring stick for what constitutes this trait, but it is a descriptor I see thrown around a lot. To illustrate this point, at Pancho&#39;s virtually every time I have shown up there I am about the only white guy in the joint. The guy behind the counter speaks almost no English and my Spanish skills do not extend much farther than being able to order beers and lap dances in Tijuana. Ordering is sort of a case study in non-verbal communication. I have stopped in a couple of times on the weekends to get carry out and they have non-stop Karaoke in the attached bar. It&#39;s is wall to wall Mexican dudes in cowboy hats and boots. Yup, I would say it qualifies as a authentic then. 

The menu here is quite long, and it has options to suit about anyone&#39;s taste buds. It&#39;s also handy to swing by if I am on the go with client meetings and need carry and eat food. Both the Burritos themselves as well as the Tortas are tightly compacted and can easily be polished off while blasting down the highway. I have tried most of the accompanying meats they have here at one point or another though I recommend you stick with either the Carne Asada or the Pastor as they are both excellent. Fresh tortilla&#39;s are also kicked out nice and hot from their press. I have tried the Tacos and Gorditas here as well but I always gravitate back to the burritos. They are always a safe bet. The really disappointing aspect here is the sauce and salsa they have. It is pretty weak. I admit I like really spicy food but this stuff is to the point my Mom could eat it. It needs to pack at least some punch. 

There is no table service here. You just go up to the counter to place your order and they throw it up in the window for you when it is ready. No shortage of places to sit as the inside is huge and is recently remodeled, though this was mostly done to accommodate the aforementioned Karaoke/bar crowd. 

Overall this is a solid option for Mexican grub and food comes out quick which is handy when I am pressed for time."

My Combo #3 was a tender pork-filled tamale, a greasy enchilada topped with sliced cheese and a gooey, cheese-filled quesadilla. There was a nice little nest of bagged tortilla chips, a dollop of spicy guacamole, a nice smear of cheese-topped refried beans and cold, dry rice - all for less than $9.00.  Sadly, my chili relleno was ready and plated far earlier than the rest of the freshly-prepared meal, and the guy at the grill opted to reheat my perfectly fried pepper on the flat-top, pressing it down so flat it was almost unrecognizable. A three-star vote for authenticity and price,  but the whole meal felt a bit greasy."

Didn&#39;t get them because of this. My husband ordered a steak burrito with a side of fries. The fries were very dry - tasted like they were basic frozen fries that ended up sitting a while after they were cooked. The prices are a bit higher than I&#39;m used to paying for mexican takeout - $7.50 for my burrito and $3 for a side of rice. They do offer a burrito combo with a side and a drink for cheaper, but only certain fillings were included (and not chile relleno)! All in all, it was good. I&#39;d go back."

I had a taste for tacos--not the taco-like food at Taco Bell, but authentic tacos--, and decided to do some digging for another place after a not-so-awesome visit from a certain card-ripping entity.  And I found that Pancho&#39;s Burritos is not far from where I live, so off I went.

As soon as I went in, I noticed the very extensive menu.  I decided to try Combo #1...3 tacos (I got chicken), chips and guac, refried beans, rice, and a fountain beverage.  I waited about 5 minutes for my order.

The guacamole is delicious and fresh, with nice chunks of avocado.  The beans and rice were pretty good.  The tacos didn&#39;t skimp on the meat, and tasted great, but needed a little extra flavor.  Each table has a bottle of red sauce and a bottle of green sauce, so I decided to try each of them.  The red sauce has a nice kick to the food.  The green sauce...watch your mouth.  It is so spicy that my eyes and sinuses were cleared (not a pretty thought, I know).

It was about halfway through my meal that I noticed that they have Mexican Coca-Cola for sale.  I was thirsty, seeing as I swallowed the juice of Hell on my tacos.  I go to ask the cashier if there are refills on the fountain beverages, she says no.  So I decide to order a Mexican Coke.  She charges me $2, and offers to open it for me, which is very nice of her.  I hand her my credit card (which I used previously to pay for my lunch) and she says, &#34;Even for $2, you don&#39;t have any bills?&#34;  No, not even for $2.  If I had the bills, I would have given them to her.  So, instead, I use my credit card, which, last time I checked, is allowed.  I simply say, &#34;No, I don&#39;t.&#34;  So she replies, &#34;Well, I&#39;m going to have to charge a tax then.&#34;  A tax?  Otherwise known as a fee for using a card?  I say, &#34;That&#39;s fine.&#34;  She then hands me my receipt without acknowledgement.

Aside from the rude handling of the Coke transaction, this place wasn&#39;t bad.  I know that it costs businesses money to accept credit cards, and I am happy to pay a small fee to use my card for good food and service.  I&#39;m happy to come back for a burrito someday."

My son and I were looking for a night of cheap eats.  After reading a few of the reviews of Pancho&#39;s, which is only a couple of miles from our home, we decided to give it a try.

First of all, the place does not look like much from the outside.  And, when you walk in, I have to admit we had a thought or two about staying.  That is, until we realized that more than half of the place was shut off for a private party.  It was someone&#39;s 70th birthday party - lots of people and a pretty good Beatles cover band.

I&#39;m not sure if this is the way it always works there, but we ordered at the counter.  The menu is on the wall next to the register and it is VERY extensive.  The menu covers the more traditional meats and veggies to the more exotic (for Gringos like me) such as Lingua.  Since it was the first time I was there, I went with a Chicken Burrito to be safe.  My son ordered a Pork Burrito.  Neither of us had beans or rice, which was fine since the Burritos were so large.  You are given both green and red salsas in condiment squeeze bottles. After tasting both (which were really good), I used the red which was pretty spicy.

For $15 we had two large, fresh, home-made burritos and two cokes with live music.  I&#39;m not so sure we&#39;ll expect a band the next time we&#39;re there, but we will be regulars here."

They have vegetarian options on their menu, but what do you think they consider &#39;veggies&#39;??Answer- lettuce and tomatoes. Really!?? No peppers, onions, squash, etc etc. They don&#39;t even have those veggies in the restaurant! Their Enchiladas have no sauce on the top and are literally impossible to cut through with the plastic knives they have. One of our friends spent nearly 2 mins to cut a piece with the plastic cutlery. He finally gave up and ate the enchilada with his hands! That hard. UGH!

As for the music, they play mexican/ salsa music. And if this isn&#39;t your thing, you might seriously want to try somewhere else.

The two stars is for the server who was friendly."

Highlights:

Tacos- very good, not skimpy on steak (other meat options available)  
Salsa- Wife really enjoyed the salsa de verde (green)
Tortas- Bread was super soft.  Lots of meat, whole slices of avacado w/ lettuce, etc.

This may very well be a regular spot for me on the way home from work!

The Torta has a nice slice of avocado which I absolutely adore - this really is the closest thing to eating in Mexico that I have had anywhere.  YUM!

Pancho&#39;s is fairly solid.  I tried the taco combo.  Pork taco, 2 steak tacos, rice, beans, and a little guac.  Call me a gringo, but steak tacos are my standard for judgement.  Pancho&#39;s steak tacos are pretty basic.  Coulda used a little more seasoning, even though I do like my steak tacos not overly seasoned.  
Rice, beans, &amp; guac were also pretty basic.  
No real standouts, but nothing subpar.  For the area that seems to be lacking in the cuisine, Pancho&#39;s will certainly suffice.  I&#39;m not a regular to the area, so not sure I&#39;d make the effort to get back.  I&#39;m one that likes to try new places more often than not (gotta get places to get my yelp on, ya know).
Pancho&#39;s does appear to be prepared to throw a killer party.  They have a stage with speakers, ready for a band.  Party lighting and all..."

I made the mistake of not trying the chicken because I prefer steak, but MAN the chicken is flavored very nicely. I&#39;d say I like it better than the steak.

The place is small and decorated nicely.  Very basic inside, but what do you really need at a quick mexican food place?  There is a TV that plays Mexican TV programming all day in the dining area, so that&#39;s good if you want to watch TV.
Service is quick and efficient.  The place is open until 9 PM Mon-Sat...not sure about Sunday. 
On to the food...  
The Torta Milanesa was alright, but needed more flavor...maybe a little more salt &amp; pepper on the meat and breading would help.  
The steak torta and steak burrito are not good.  The meat that they use is vile.  It&#39;s gritty, fatty, and unappealing.  I do not suggest anything with their steak.  
Horchata was really good.  
Would possibly try something else from there, but was turned off from my last visit."

The food was always great. The last time I went I asked for Cilantro on the taco. It came with none. When my friend took it back and asked for Cilantro the cook gave him a dirty look but put Cilantro on it. The Cilantro was all browm and yucchy! When my friend took it back to the cook, the cook said, &#34;Well, you wanted Cilantro!&#34; My friend explained that it was bad, the cook said, &#34;It&#39;s all bad&#34;. I am sorry - but get a dollar from the register and go next door to the grocery store and buy some fresh Cilantro! That was the last time I was there. I refuse to eat (or shop) where the staff has an indifferent attitude towards the customer. I understand a bad day - but this staff was always kind of like that. I see they now also have a bar, I wish them all the success in the world because the older gentleman and his wife (presumably the owners) seem very nice. I think they let their kid manage too often - and he doesn&#39;t do anything but sit and play on his PC and ring the register when a customerr comes in. 

They do have a TV - but I quickly figured out it is for the staff - not the customers. The tables don&#39;t get cleaned very often and the place was never real clean - wasn&#39;t dirty - but wasn&#39;t clean - if you know what I mean.

The Great: 

- The cheese fries amaze (yes, you heard me right). Who would think at a Mexican place? Try it to believe it. 
- Charred jalapenos. They are lightly salted and grilled to perfection, but not for the weak-hearted. Super spicy, but I find myself addictedly chomping away tiny bite-after-bite in hopes I don&#39;t fall over...
- Super steak burrito - great value and bountiful ingredients.
- Chicken tostadas are yum. Seasoned well. 
- Their homemade green and red hot sauces
- Horchata 

Room for improvement: 

- It would be nice if they offered free chips &amp; salsa like many Mex establishments for dine-in customers
- The chorizo taco is very yummy but wish they would drain the oil a bit more because it gets soggy after a while. 


Overall value is decent, food is good/consistent, and it is pretty clean compared to some of the other like-joints I&#39;ve been to."

I&#39;d possibly go to 3.5 stars if I could and maybe 4 on the steak burrito itself, but the place is what it is and really does not warrent more than a flat 3 star rating.  There often seems to be disorganization between making the order, delivering the order to the grill, then wrapping up the order.  They&#39;ve never messed up my order because when I see this going on in a place I hawk them and make sure I get what I ordered.  However, I&#39;ve seen other people&#39;s orders in pretty much complete chaos.  I live about 2-3 miles from this place, and this misplaced south sider hasn&#39;t found a better local burrito yet.  In the south burbs this would be all around not as good as most places, but I&#39;m glad I have it here. It also should be mentioned the prices, especially for the large burrito, are fair.

Then today the &#34;owner&#34; she says ( name starts with an N) came out after a delivery came in, grabbed a knife off the sandwich making station, opened a bunch of boxes with it, then put it back and came to make my sandwich!  Horrified I asked if she could use a different knife, you know one that didn&#39;t have shipment germs all over it, where she looked at me funny, wiped it on her apron and said it was clean.  Um, no. Im in healthcare. It&#39;s NOT clean. Needless to say I made her rip the bread. Id rather have a messed up sandwich than a dirty one!!! Omg!"

I arrived to find a line 6 people deep, with only one unenthusiastic employee assembling sandwiches and ringing up orders.  I waited about 15 minutes for my turn to order when another employee came up front and served me without the slightest hint of a smile or eye contact.  I wasn&#39;t looking to have my ego stroked, but I could have chosen to go anywhere for lunch.  They should be appreciative that they have a long line of customers that are interested in giving them business.

The food was exactly as I expected: unremarkable.  It is Subway, after all.  It certainly wasn&#39;t worth the wait, though.  I&#39;m just grateful that I have a job with flexible schedules, or I&#39;d be pretty damn pissed about a ruined lunch hour waiting for one sandwich.  Without so much as a &#34;thank you&#34; or a smile.

Get it together, Subway, and next time I&#39;ll look forward to spending lunch with you."

While the person was repeating back our order to confirm who we were, we realized they had a portion of the order wrong. We had ordered through Grub Hub and since you simply select what you want, there shouldn&#39;t have been any errors. They said it would take another hour to get the order corrected. 

We asked them to take the incorrect item off and send the rest. Supposedly the guy was already on his way. These guys are 2 miles from us. 40 minutes later, still no guy. We called again.  They started to say the guy wasn&#39;t coming, then changed it to that he should be here soon. By this time we we&#39;re starving. 

We contacted Grub Hub who refunded the entire order. (We only asked for the incorrect portion to be refunded, but they really wanted us to be happy)

I wish I could give them less than one star - maybe have a negative rating system installed huh, Yelp?"

I was riding down Algonquin and decided to stop in. Based on the number of reviews and being somewhat high, I decided to give it a go.

First impression- place was in a run down strip center and inside was not very appealing. Floors and tables had food particles but ironically the place smelled like bleach. Large menu with standard choices. Nothing out of the ordinary.

I ordered chicken lo mein. As I ordered the clerk said it would be a 10 minute wait. As I began to wait, I decided to actually review the pictures from the Yelp reviews. To my surprise(not really) I noticed that one mentioned of cockroaches. As I starred around me, I was not surprised yet for some reason decided to continue. 

I came back into the store , I stood watching the clerks unload boxes. The lady was wearing latex gloves, purple to be exact, and as she was opening a box that appeared to be for soy sauce packets, she shrieked ew and jumped back. The gentleman beside her, seemed non bothered and looked inside the box and moved it to the floor. After seeing the reviews and what I witnessed, I decided that I couldn&#39;t do it. I kindly accepted the food, only for the sake of this review. 

Food- From the looks, it&#39;s standard. Not greasy as you may find at other places. Lacked chicken. Large vegetables with a light sauce. Sorry I did not taste it.

My recommendation would be to proceed with caution, unless you want to risk extra protein in your food. I would hate to taint a restaurant reputation, but when there are red flags, I do not proceed.

Maybe someone else had a different and better experience. Good luck

Good luck!"

All three flavors tasted markedly similar even though they were all what I would consider vastly different items. Each lunch special was marked as spicy so I can&#39;t say they didn&#39;t warn me on that! Their eggrolls are not as big as some other Chinese places but their lunch specials are HUGE in size.

They delivered the fried chicken pieces, but no sweet and sour sauce for the sweet and sour chicken.  Fried foods very greasy, obviously not drained before packaging.

The interior was a little sketchy and snug but served its purpose. It had a broad menu and when asked about their favorites they pointed us towards the Sesame Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, General Tso&#39;s and Seafood Delight. 

It was a sad and tragic moment for me. After spending a year in China I was hoping for the Mandarin host to point me to dishes that could be found in the mainland. Instead we were instantaneously shown Americanized-Chinese dishes -- those that are filled to the brim with proteins coated in deep fried dough and slathered with gravy, and lest we forget the 6 slivers of carrots, the 1&#34; by 1&#34; square of green pepper, and 2 dying sprigs of broccoli that we fought over. 

We ended up ordering a Large order of General Tso&#39;s for approximately $10.45 Post tax. When in Rome. 

The description above does the dish justice. The staff was very nice, and our food was ready in less than 10 minutes. Overall it was pretty good, yet not great. The spice level was like a slap in the face which was delightful after our tragic jaunt into The Indian Bistro later that night (see other review). Andy states that &#34;it is the spiciest General Tso&#39;s that [I have] ever eaten&#34;. Especially since those little &#34;spicy chili peppers&#34; that they place next to food dishes are typically misnomers.

We will not be returning, especially when The Wonton Gourmet is a stones throw away. We gives this place a 2.5/5 because honestly, when you think of Chinese take-out this is the place you should envision. And if you&#39;re intrigued, their Lunch and Dinner specials sound like fantastic deals."

We stopped in memorial weekend for early dinner (6 pm). Service was super friendly and helpful in working through the many choices on the menu.  We started with a couple of the house made empanadas made with a crisp buttery crust and served with a marinara sauce.  One is big enough for two people. They were crispy and really good.

For dinner I tried the Diablo chicken which was a half chicken cooked flat and smothered with a thick red somewhat spicy sauce. The waiter warned me that it was spicy but I felt it wasn&#39;t too bad-it was similar to a Mexican Mole sauce. My wife had roasted salmon that she enjoyed and we also tried the gnocchi (apparently a lot of Italians immigrated to Argentina back in the day) that was light and creamy.

They were really busy on Sunday night, we were on the waiting list when we got there. The service is pretty good and staff is pretty friendly. The decor in the restaurant is pretty nice but there isn&#39;t too much space between the tables, so no privacy and you can pretty much hear other tables talking. My two buddies who came with me, were complaining about the noise level, it was quite a lot.

We started things off with each of us getting an Empanada - I got the chicken and other two got the caprese (veg). There are 4 other choices of the filling - spianch, green onion, ground sirloin and ham &amp; cheese. Total 6 choices - 3 veg and 3 meat. The pastry was hot and crisp with cheese and whatever choice of filling you ask for. It was really good. I really liked my chicken empanada. 

For our entrees, my friends got the lamb ravioli and the authentic grilled steak. I tried the lamb ravioli it was pretty good and the steak I heard was good too. I got the Pescado En salsa dealmendras (tilapia with almonds in a white wine sauce along with veggies and mashed potatoes), that was really really good. Oh wow, fish was cooked well - really soft and sauce was not over-powering, almonds topping it with a crunch and texture. The mashed potatoes and grilled veggies just there to neutralize the rich taste of the dish. I highly recommend this dish.

We then finished it off with a flan de leches which was pretty good. Overall food was really good, dining experience besides the wait and slightly high price was good. We paid almost $35-40 a person just for an appetizer + entree + one dessert to share.

P.S.  They have a section for seasonal appetizers/entrees and the regular appetizers/entrees. They also have a huge section of wines. In the regular appetizers - there were a couple of bread options which were non-meat based. (veg). The entrees had italian dishes which were veg but no authentic food which was Veg. Probably for meat eaters - this is a place to TRY :)"

I stumbled across this place because of its decor..... Very festive! The music however did not flow with the season and it&#39;s really really small maybe 14 tables max. The servers were very pleasant however the Diablo chicken I ordered was not that great. It was heavily smothered in sauce that over powered the flavor of the meat. The chicken was uncooked and fatty in some spots, and the veggies were over cooked....
Wish I had a better review to write."

They took over 20 mins to take our order.  About 40 mins later one dish came and they forgot the pizza.  So we had to wait another 15 mins. 

It took over an hour and a half for everyone to get food. I though that was pretty bad.  

FYI this isn&#39;t a very kid friendly place.  They make accommodations but the space is really tight and menu not kid friendly.  Not a negative but something to keep in mind."

My main course was the pot roast and it exceeded my expectations. It was super tender, served with a blend of grilled peppers, asparagus and zucchini, mashed potatoes as well. I tried two empanadas - caprese and beef and these were super soft and delicious.

The empanadas were delicious! Full of meat inside, perfectly seasoned. Unfortunately, everything else we tried after this was either bland or unseasoned. The crispy calamari appetizer is big enough for 2, and so was the entree featuring different meats, all of which lacking in flavor. We expected bold flavors...we grill at home quite often, and achieve better results in flavor. Not worth coming back as much as we wanted to like it."

I had a work lunch here today, and though it&#39;s pretty far from where I live, if I was in the area again I&#39;d come back for sure. I ordered their special that comes with a cup of soup (tomato-basil) a light side salad, and an empanada of my choice (spinach and cheese). The soup was loaded with flavor. A burst of tomato with ground up chunks of basil to give it a bit of texture. What I loved about my salad was the fact it was simple with light dressing. I typically only have olive oil on my salads, so I really appreciated that the dressing was barely noticeable and not too strong. The spinach and cheese empanada was packed with cooked spinach. Take note, it was super rich and fried (I think) and reminded me of biting into a slice of veggie quiche. So, if you like crust like I do, you&#39;ll really enjoy these.

It was crowded and loud in there, which is why I only gave my review 4 out of 5 stars.  I honestly couldn&#39;t hear a word my dining partner was saying across the table - only a few words here and there. Additionally, I&#39;m on crutches right now, so maneuvering between the close tables was a bit tricky. 

The service was excellent, though it seemed like we waited a bit for it to come out (maybe because I was super hungry). Dishes were cleared from the table right away, and my iced tea was filled up 3-4 times without having to ask. That&#39;s a major win on a nice summery day. 

A delightful experience overall."

I knew we had made the right choice as soon as I got out of the car. The aroma of the food hung in the air made me instantly hungrier.

This place is tiny. Like a hole in the wall might be an overstatement. They squeeze tables in there, and there isn&#39;t a lot of space to spread out. Don&#39;t let that deter you though. Once you start imbibing and snacking on some breadsticks and empanadas, you will be in your own world. 

The food is Argentinian which coincidentally is all the best stuff from Spain and Italy based on my knowledge of global cuisine (almost none). The empanadas were amazing. My wife and I split 3 of them to try different flavors (chicken, sirloin, and caprese). All 3 were great, and I may even order more next time. 

For my entree, I had Vacio A La Parilla. A delicious steak with plenty of flavor served with roasted potatoes (ok), and grilled vegetables (excellent). 

My wife had Pollo Al Mattone. A half chicken cooked in a brick oven with the same potatoes and grilled veggies. The chicken excellent. Juicy, tender, and flavorful.

The portions were also huge. My wife and I each took home leftovers. 

This is a great place, and I am reluctant at letting anyone else in on the secret. I don&#39;t want this place to get so busy that I can&#39;t get a table anymore."

It&#39;s been months since I&#39;ve been, but I still recall the creative menu, cozy interior and awesome tomato basil soup I pummeled through. As mentioned, the menu is super diverse, so AC is a great spot for those with varying tastes. I was much appreciative of the Chef&#39;s trio in which you can choose three varied menu items for an affordable price tag. I went with the rag tag options of chicken parm sandwich, salad and the aforementioned tomato basil soup. Each was tasty but the standout was the soup - very flavorful, creamy and tomato-y perfection.

Best restaurant heading in the downtown area is a must to go to. Their menu features amazing Argentinian items and classic Italian and Hispanic fare. 

The empanadas were made from an amazing dough, but the fillings were ok. 

The gazpacho was well made and fresh as it should be.

The Salmon seasonal entree was delicious but the salmon was slightly overcooked

The homemade lamb ravioli was outstanding and the sauce made it even better. 

The panna cotta dessert was extremely light and delicious, but the chocolate chip cookies that accompanied it did not go well with the panna cotta and ruined its flavor. 

The service was slow, but the server was very interactive when he came to the table and we enjoyed it.

At first we weren&#39;t sure about Argentinian food or the name of the resturaunt, but got over the odd name pretty quick. The food is perfect! They serve freshly baked bread sticks before your meal (tastes like they&#39;re made from the pizza dough, and I love it). Favorite apps are baked goat cheese dip and the empanadas. The beef empanadas were delicious. My boyfriend got the lamb ravioli the first time we went, and we went back because they were so good he was craving them for weeks after. I tried a more traditional chicken diablo dish the first time. A little too spicy for me personally, but very good and very flavorful. Second time I had a pasta dish... you can tell all pastas are home made, and it was very good.

This was definetley a great find in downtown Palatine where food options are limited to mostly bar food. Be prepared for slow, but very professional, knowledgeful and friendly service. They have a very small dinning room, which can feel a little crowded at times, and typically only one server and a busser. But just be patient and enjoy the dinning experience. You shouldn&#39;t be disappointed.

I&#39;ve been eyeing the pizzas when we go, because they look and smell delicious. And the to go menu as well, which is different than the dinning menu and offers sandwhiches. We&#39;ll be back soon!"

I have worked really hard on keeping an open mind about different foods. For those that have been reading my reviews,  you can vouch for me. I even eat spicy food now. That&#39;s a sentence I thought I would never say (write to be accurate for the sake of this review). 
So I came here on a Wednesday night and brought my two very foreign friends. One from Bulgaria and one from Georgia. Three funny little countries combined and it&#39;s a recipe for disaster. A bit of a vague background information. Most people from the eastern European realm (even Georgia) tend not to get out of thier comfort zone. We eat our stews with feta cheese,  lots of bread and tomatoes and we rarely eat anything else unless it resembles our culture. We usually tend to suggest that all other countries should do the same. Thank god my mother does not speak English. Either way I didn&#39;t care I was determined to try this place out and take it off my yelp bucket list. Well needless to say we all loved it and can&#39;t wait to return. 
So we sat down and they were very skeptical about the menu but the server was very helpful with everything from wine suggestions to the food. We had the steak the tilapia and I had the salmon and the baked goat cheese for appetizer. Well I tried everything and they were all great. I am in love. I wanna take the chef/cook home.

I&#39;ve had this quaint Argentinian eatery bookmarked for two damn years and I&#39;m rather embarrassed to say that I only just recently popped in. It&#39;s really a shame because I&#39;ll bet I would&#39;ve been a much more pleasant person if I&#39;d spent some of that time entertaining my diet with Artistic Cuisine&#39;s immaculate empanadas instead of some of the other crap I eat. 

The place is pretty darn cozy in terms of size, but they do have a nice little outdoor patio and the front vestibule where they do pick-up and catering orders is largely out of site once you enter the dining room. 

I&#39;d never had Argentine food before, so I did a little research beforehand and based on what I read, it&#39;s apparently very reminiscent of Italian food, and while the AC menu did carry a variety of unique things, the overall Italian-vibe was present and I did hear other tables ask about the similarities as well, but I&#39;m sure if you lived somewhere where Argentinian food was more common than Italian, you might say that Italian food seems a lot like Argentinean food. None of that really mattered to me either way. Good food is good food and I&#39;m always down for some delicious eats. 

We started with a couple of empanadas, which were much bigger than I was expecting and came in a variety of flavors like sirloin, spinach, chicken, ham &amp; cheese, caprese, cheese &amp; green onions and more! They came with a red sauce that was like a marinara, but we preffered our spinach and caprese empanadas straight, no chaser and they were divine. Next time I&#39;ll probably just get a million of those bad boys. 

I wasn&#39;t super hungry so I got thier grilled octopus appetizer. The octopus was in a really rich, delicious broth and was served with crunchy bread, but I did feel like the octopus was tad rubbery. I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d order this dish again with so many other stars on the menu. 

My partner got the veggie sandwich, which sounds super boring, but that was hardly the case. It was definitely a family-size sandwich and you practically needed a third hand to lift the entire half-loaf of in-house, freshly baked bread that it&#39;s served on (pita style). It was made with beautiful and colorful fresh veggies, marinated perfectly and priced rather nominally for how large and well-done it was. 

I left really happen to now be in the know about Argentinian food, sad that I wasted so much time not eating here in the past and excited to come back (like, every week) for their special lunch and dinner menus."

The previous review is right, the aroma spills out the door and draws you right in. 

The actual restaurant is very small, and they squeeze as many tables as they can in there. This did not bother me, and don&#39;t let it bother you. The food is that good. In fact it added to the ambiance of the place. Everyone seemed to be really enjoying themselves and even joined in conversations from table to table. 

I had the Estofado De Carne (an Argentinian style Pot Roast) and my husband had the Pappardelle Caseros Con Frutos De Mar A La Plancha (seafood w/a pasta in a spicy tomato sauce). 

Both were the best dishes we have had in a long time. My husband raved about his, stating it was fresh and had a good kick to it!  The Pot Roast was super tender, flavorful and beyond perfect. Everything tasted super fresh and was served nice and hot. So many restaurants I go to have served dishes lukewarm, not here! 

Palatine is often passed over for it&#39;s larger neighbor Arlington Heights, but I am telling you, you must add Artistic Cuisine to your short list. You won&#39;t be sorry. It&#39;s a true gem."

My friend and I came here for dinner on a weeknight. It is a small, intimate restaurant with about 15 tables (this fills up FAST - get here as early as you can!). There really isn&#39;t a waiting area either, so if you can&#39;t get in right away, I can&#39;t imagine it would be fun to wait here. It also gets a little loud after the room fills up. We were seated right away. There are murals painted on the wall and pictures of people dancing scattered around. It is dimly lit with flickering candles lit on every table.

The menu was surprisingly similar to many other places I had eaten, and to many cuisines I have had before. There is pasta, soups, salads, and meat/fish entrees. Nothing crazy or out of the ordinary. I ordered the Vacio A La Parrilla and sangria. The sangria was awesome - and you get a full glass. They also bring out small bread sticks to munch on while you wait. The steak was cooked perfectly, not over seasoned, and the mashed potatoes and vegetables were tasty as well. The meal took a while to come out, but if it ends up tasting good and the quality is there, I don&#39;t care. From what I noticed, they really play with the natural flavors of the food and don&#39;t try to cover it up with salt and other seasonings. I appreciate that.

The only downfall was that the service was a little slow. We didn&#39;t see our waiter much (although he was very nice), and we only got a refill on our water and drinks once. It took a while for them to come to our table too, before it was even busy. However, the atmosphere and the food made up for the lack of attention."

A small place so allow time to sit. Very quaint and a little noisy. You will find yourself talking over people to be heard.

We started off with a bottle of Catena Male 2012. Little pricy for a bottle but very nice and recommended for a medium bodied, smooth red. We ordered appetizers Corian Con Salsa Criolla, Viera Glaseadas, and a steak and chicken Empinata. The apps were good. First Empinata I have had. Very light and fluffy. The best app was the scallops wrapped in bacon. But everything is better with bacon. I would eat my toe if it was wrapped in bacon. 

For the entrees, we had the steak and potatoes, pot roast and vegetable, and the seafood pasta. I had the pot roast and must say it was good and I would have it again. However I must say I am the type of person looking for the extra. I can&#39;t say anything bad about the dish, but it tasted the same as other pot roasts. No extra spices or kick. The comments on the steak was again very good. Good taste, prepared well. The seafood past from what was left was again enjoyed.

I would say for people trying Argentinian food for the first time is not to worry. The food is excellent and you will enjoy. Everything seems to be prepared well and seasoned on the conservative side. ENJOY."

Artistic Cuisine may not have the fanciest menu but they use good ingredients such as Revolution brand for their hot tea and fresh greens instead of lettuce in their salad. The use of good ingredients and fresh preparation is evident in their dishes through superior flavor and aroma.

I can say that I am pleased with every item I tried, but several items really stood out.

Soups -- Tomato basil and roasted red pepper were my favorites. Creamy, thick, and robust flavors make these truly a joy to consume (the bread is home made and excellently compliments the soup).

Empanadas - These are kind of like large fried pot stickers filled with excellent fillings. I especially liked the chicken offering.

Gourmet pizza - Thin crispy crust, slightly sweet tomato sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. This is my favorite thin crust pizza of any local restaurant. Perfect if you&#39;re a Lou Malnati&#39;s or Giordano&#39;s fan but don&#39;t feel like eating deep dish that day.

Vacio sandwich - Few people can make top sirloin as tasty and tender as ribeye, but AC does it. Full of flavor and a great deal.

The Chef&#39;s lunch trio is a steal at $8 (soup, salad, and either a half sandwich, slice of pizza, or empanada). 

This has replaced all my trips to Giannis and Biaggis and is a serious contender to Toscana."

Recommended by co-workers who rave about the food. And I concur, excellent lunch, sat down, ordered, ate and done in an hour. Food freshly prepared, great quality with excellent service. Portion was enough for two meals (eating moderately). I had a skirt steak with grilled vegetables, extra portion of veggies and skipped the mashed that came as a side. The steak was perfectly prepared, juicy, tender and absolutely delicious. Definitely a new lunch fave! Although I&#39;d certainly enjoy dinner there as well. Pleasantly atmosphere and clean environment."

If you were blindfolded and had a plate of their spinach gnocchi and a plate of Chef Boyardee you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell the difference. Literally tastes the same. Brought me right back to my childhood memories of spaghettios. Service is good and friendly but BOY is the food blah and for the prices; I expect way more. Goat cheese appetizer is a bowl of Chef Boyardee tomatoes sauce with a plop of goat cheese in the middle. Underwhelming at best.

Chef Zee  was the key to this place,  since his departure the service and atmosphere has gone down.  There is no doubt that the food is good, but if you want to request any change to your order be prepared for them to tell you it is a $2.00 fee.  I asked if they would substitute a Bowl of soup instead of a salad and cup of soup in the lunch trio (cup of soup, salad and half sandwich or Empanada) and they wanted to charge $2.00 extra.  My order total for a Bowl of soup and 1 Empanada (had they made the change) would already have been $10.50 (which I feel is expensive). I would hate to see what they would charge to accommodate a person with food allergies.  It is a shame.  Thankfully there are a lot of local restaurants in downtown Palatine and I would suggest supporting one of the restaurants that want your business.  I hate to be nickel and dimed when I can go to across the street and get a bowl of soup for $3.65.  Maybe I should have given 1 star..."

I should have redeemed my certificate somewhere else. The food was unimpressive and pricey (I spent over $40 for dinner even after using my gift certificate) and I left with half a dozen mosquito bites from dining outside on the patio.

I have to admit that I had no idea what &#34;typical&#34; Argentinian food was. I assumed it was just meat dishes but was surprised to learn that it includes pasta as well. The boyfriend and I ordered both types of dishes so we could get a fair sampling of the menu: the most popular steak dish (Vacio a la Parrilla) as well as the seafood pasta special. We also tried the empanadas as an appetizer.

The meal started with some complimentary breadsticks that were cold and a little stale. The empanadas had a good crust but the fillings were bad. The spinach &amp; cheese had way too much flavorless cheese and the beef tasted like sloppy Joe meat. The Vacio a la Parilla was disappointing as well. First off, the waiter didn&#39;t even ask how I wanted the steak cooked. That&#39;s a bad sign at any restaurant that serves steak. Even Denny&#39;s asks if you order steak &amp; eggs.  I would have preferred the steak to be a little more rare. Our dish had no flavor and was too chewy. The pasta was also a little too &#34;al dente&#34; for my taste and the sauce was really overpowering. We didn&#39;t even bother ordering dessert. Instead we went to Spunky Dunker to cheer ourselves up with some donuts."

It seems as if you are torn between being a great pizza place &amp; a great higher-end dining location.  In the end, however, your service needs to greatly improve in order to pull anything off beyond a pizza take-out place.

We don&#39;t normally dine out for Valentine&#39;s Day but after being cooped up for a while with an illness I really needed to get out of the house.  We made reservations for Friday night &amp; the place was jam packed with plenty of people waiting.  We were 15 min early for our rez &amp; were told it would be a slight wait.  Okay, fine. Though there was a table for 4 open the entire time while we, and others, waited...I guess they were hoping a group of 4 would wander in.  After 10 minutes they went ahead and sat us at that open table.  By the way, they have no actual waiting area so we were all crammed in the small area in front of their to-go pickup counter which also doubles as the area where they keep the wine &amp; some shelves &amp; the vacuum, etc.  Ugh.  I had a clear view of the kitchen and saw the servers regularly bring back breadstick baskets (from the tables where the diners had left), dump the uneaten breadsticks in the trash, but didn&#39;t&#39; bother switching out the parchment paper lining the baskets.  I don&#39;t know, maybe that&#39;s a normal thing but I thought it was kinda gross since I know other people had touched the paper.  I also overheard someone picking up pizza say to one of the staff, &#34;Oh, you added more tables!&#34; to which they replied, yes, they put in 5 additional tables.  That&#39;s all fine and good IF you have the staff (both servers &amp; in the kitchen) to accommodate this extra activity...which they did NOT.

We were seated and sat for about 10 minutes before our server came over to take our drink order.  He brought our drinks back and we ordered a couple of Empanadas to share (cheese &amp; green onion and the ground sirloin) to start.  Placing our order was the last time our server even stopped at our table until he finally dropped of the check....no stopping by to make sure everything was good or to see if we wanted more to drink (we did).  The Empanadas were both delicious!  About 15 minutes later our entrees came out.  By this time I had one tiny sip of wine left &amp; The Hubs was done with his beer but no one noticed &amp; our server never came back so we drank water the rest of the evening.  My meal, the lamb ravioli, was very good (though for 5 average-sized raviolis I&#39;d say it was overpriced at $20).  The Hubs ordered one of their specials of the night, which was Sweet Potato Encrusted Salmon w/grilled veggies.  The veggies were fine, but the salmon was bland and had no seasoning and the sweet potato was not cooked enough so it was partially cooked shredded sweet potato around the salmon and whoever &#34;encrusted&#34; it had a hard time getting it to stick.  The salmon wasn&#39;t bad, really, and it was a huge piece, but it certainly was lackluster.

We were done eating and sat there waiting for our server to come by with no luck.  We sat there for 15 minutes when a someone came by to refill our water &amp; we asked him to bring us a boxes.  We sat there another 15 minutes with no one stopping by.  Every time anyone walked by our table they were always looking the other way and it was so noisy in the crowded place even giving a loud, &#39;EXCUSE ME!&#34; didn&#39;t help until we pretty much had to yell &amp; literally grab someone.  It was one of the owners, I believe, or at least a manager, and we asked her if we could please have our check as we&#39;d been done eating for a half-hour and our server hadn&#39;t once come back.  No apology, just a nod.  Our server comes back a few minutes later (FINALLY), no comment at all, no apology, and just drops the check on the table.  WTH?  The manager lady comes back a few minutes later and takes the check for us.

In the end we were there OVER 2 hours.  We had intended to have dessert &amp; coffee there as well but by then we just wanted to get the hell out of there.  We stopped at Mariano&#39;s instead on the way home &amp; picked out desserts &amp; enjoyed that at home.

They may be better any other day of the year but how they handled Valentine&#39;s Day was a big FAIL in my opinion and we will not be back...and based on their attitude I really don&#39;t think they care."

The fillings were mildly flavored but the crust was fantastic.  That pretty much sums this place up.  Really nice dishes, but nothing really wowed us.  We will return and see if we just missed their best offerings.  

We had a mixed seafood platter for two that was straightforward and fine.  The appetizer scallops were, again, mild.  We enjoyed the butternut squash soup--delicate.  Service was very good.  Next time, the Diablo Chicken calls.   Something with some &#34;pop&#34;."

What can I say except that all the food was fantastic. Fresh and very flavorful. I appreciated that the salad was actually beautiful mixed greens and not just a pile of iceburg lettuce and that the dressing was a light balsamic vinaigrette.

We waited almost 30 Min., which is too long in my eyes if you have a reservation. They should organize this way better. The problem is also, that they don&#39;t have a bar, so you are standing in the entrance while you are waiting, which is very unpleasant.

You  can tell that they use the freshest ingredients and quality cheese. Although it&#39;s really only at its best went you dine in and get it really hot right out of the oven. Takeout gives it just enough time to steam in the box which causes the crust to loose some of its molecular structure.  Also I think the sauce they use is olive oil based and sometimes to oily.

They make my favorite pizza in Palatine. On the rare occasion my husband and I order pizza we always argue about whether to get it from here or Pizza Bella. Pizza Bella is good, but AC&#39;s pizza is better, fresher, more creative, and more flavorful to me. I love the Napolitano pizza with fresh oregano, garlic, fresh tomato, mozzarella, and parmesan! The garlic on here is heavy, but I love it. Just don&#39;t go planning on kissing anybody unless they&#39;ve had a slice too!

I&#39;ve also tried their empandas and gnocchi, and both were pretty yummy.  And the good news is they deliver everything, not just pizza. So if you&#39;re feeling like relaxing at home but eating good food definitely call AC."

First, the main course was very good.  We had the steaks and vegis.  Very tasty.

But, we are not wine drinkers and were both disappointed that they didn&#39;t have a full bar.  The restaurant is small and we were in the center aisle.  So, about every minute, a waiter or guest was walking on either side of us (not large aisles). 

But, probably the most disappointing was this... We arrived early for a Saturday so we weren&#39;t rushed..  We had a very friendly waiter who promptly took our order.  Our appetizers arrived quickly.  And, when we were about half way completed with the appetizers, our main course arrive and they took away my wife&#39;s unfinished plate.  

When we finished with our meal, they brought the check and never asked if we wanted coffee or dessert.  Seemed they had more bookings and wanted to turn the table (55 minutes form start to finish).

We left for another restaurant for dessert.

Again, very good food and very friendly... but just not for us."

They give you breadstick twists with herbs to start off, probably could have skipped the appetizer because I ate a ton of the breadsticks and was full before my meal came. Started off with choripan con salsa criolla which was pretty good. The bread didn&#39;t seem very toasty though. He had the lamb raviolis (ravioles caseros de corderos) which was very rich but he thought had excellent flavor. I had the tenderloin medallions (lomo con champignones) which were absolutely delicious. The potatoes and veggies were so good, grilled to perfection. From the outside it doesn&#39;t look like much but inside the atmosphere is very charming. My only complaint is our server was a little rude in the beginning and not helpful with menu selections.

The dining room is small and intimate which I loved especially for a romantic dinner. The server (Jimmy: brother-in-law of the owner) was very attentive &amp; knowledgeable. He recommended all the right things and we were very happy with everything we ordered.

We had a bottle of Los Vascos Cab which was perfect. We shared the goat cheese appetizer which was fine (nothing spectacular). He ordered salmon off the seasonal menu which was cooked to perfection w/a nice potato crust. I ordered the sirloin which was juicy and flavorful. If I had one complaint, I would say it&#39;s a bit misleading to claim the entree comes with &#34;grilled asparagus&#34; and only one shows up on the plate.

I was really looking forward to the dulce de leche cheesecake that I saw on the website BUT that dessert menu was outdated--we went with flan instead which was a great alternative.

All-in-all a great first-time experience. I definitely plan on going back to try their pizza and a couple of their other Argentinian dishes."

I was surprised at their lunch menu.
They have a great selection of unique salads, sandwiches, pizza and more substantial fare.

We sat outside on a beautiful day and started with two excellent soups; the butternut squash and the roasted red pepper.
Both really hit the spot.  The roasted red pepper was particularly good.  And the chunk of bread served with each was delicious.

We had the Patagonia Salad and a Prosciutto and Arugula pizza.
The salad was a great combination of citrus and shrimp on a bed of baby greens.
The pizza was not your standard Italian pizza.  The sauce was more of a fresh tomato puree than a classic Italian pizza sauce.  It was light on spice but full on flavor.  It was different, but I really enjoyed it.

Pizzas range from $8 for a personal size (plenty for one or two) to $17 for an XL.  Pastas are $9 -$10 and sandwiches, hot and cold, run between $7.50 and $9.00.
The entree dishes are in the $12 - $15 range.

This place is great for dinner and now I&#39;m glad we tried it for lunch. I suspect it will become our new favorite lunch joint as well."

We got the baked goat cheese and spinach and sirloin empanadas for appetizers. The goat cheese swimming in some kind of tomato sauce was excellent with the crostini it came with and their soft bread. We didn&#39;t even use the sauce that came with the empanadas, they were so good by themselves! I had the Argentinian pot roast and my husband had the Pappardelle Caseros Con Frutos De Mar A La Plancha which was a spicy tomato sauced pasta with lots of seafood in it. Both of our portions were huge and ended up being our dinners, as well. I even love the grilled zucchini that came with my pot roast and I&#39;m normally not a fan of zucchini. The only minuses were that they forgot my tiramisu, luckily I checked, and we didn&#39;t see lobster in my husband&#39;s pasta, but there was a ton of seafood in it, overall, which is why I still have to give them 5 stars.

Really good food - You might think it&#39;s basic boring Italian but there are little hints of something different. Empanadas. Argentinian specialties. 
Lively atmosphere - In the summer we sit outside. In the winter, we jam into the little dining room. It&#39;s lively - maybe even noisy at times - but you get that sense of a neighborhood gathering place.
Stable, AWESOME staff - They&#39;ve had the same basic small wait staff for years - Jimmy, Junior, Carlos and the fantastic Salvador. They aren&#39;t anonymous people who just work here for a few months and bail - they are here for the long haul. They&#39;re personal. Super friendly. They even do my favorite lunch dish for me even though it&#39;s not on the menu anymore. 

So if you want same same same standardized fare, go to Schaumburg and jump in a chain. Leave this gem to us. It&#39;s our joint and long may it continue."

Krystyna&#39;s Deli (KD) is a Polish deli/grocery store that my family and I have been going to probably every few days for over 20 years. In the past few years they have completely renovated the place and expanded it to twice its original size. They have added a sushi bar, increased and diversified the staff to include people other than those only from the mother land and have included more American products. Back in the day, I would do half my grocery shopping here (meats, bread) and half of it across the street at Jewel (produce, snacks). Now I can get ALL my groceries here. Love that! 

When you enter, you&#39;ll find: 

-decent fruit and veggie produce section
-large fresh deli section
-great raw meat section
-fresh made breads and if you get your timing right....WARM rolls
-small but good sweets bakery
-sushi area where they make sushi on the spot and often have free samples
-hot lunch/dinner bar;  $5.99/meal  for 3 HUGE items. It was so much food, I shared it with 2 other people. 
-full salad bar with two different kinds of hot soups
-aisles of usual &#39;grocery&#39; crap you may need such as shampoo, creams, soda  (I love the spice section since it is so different from most US grocers)
- small but enough international beer and liquor selection

I&#39;m really happy with KD now, I do hope they stop Americanizing (is that even a word?, ha!) it because currently it has the perfect combo of European, a splash of Asian, and just enough American in it to make me a very happy girl and like a good grocer should....meets all my daily food needs."

I was a shoping at this location last Saturday and their credit card system was down. I had no idea that the system was not working but they knew. The cashier asked me to swipe my cc  and we were waiting for like 3-4 min for the transaction to go trough. Well a receipt came out saying transaction not completed, but my money was taking out of the account. So one of their employees asked me to pay at another register and he charged my CC again!! So my account got charge twice $ 185.60.....
Since then I have been trying to talk to them to provide a refund or credit. I called to speack to a mgr and they said the banck has to refund not them!!!

This is a local Chicago area chain. Unfortunately, the store recently changed its name and became more internationally focused.

Fortunately, the store still offers a very large selection of Polish foods, and their other offerings are pretty interesting as well. The deli is very large with many types of European based meat product and other cheeses. I definitely appreciate their kielbasa and kabanos very much.

The bad thing about this store are its prices, which tend to be pretty high, for items that you could find for cheaper prices in other stores, even smaller ones. Also, there are a lot of expired products in the aisles so be on the lookout for the expiration date before you purchase anything!

The staff has always been friendly to me and everyone in there speaks both Polish as well as English.

Every time I come here, the checkout process takes 20 minutes for just 2-3 items I may be buying; it&#39;s caused me to visit Jewel [across the street] a lot more often now.

Krystyna&#39;s management, please note the following:
1) You need an Express Lane... &#34;10 Items or Less&#34;
2) Your cashiers need to tell people who have been waiting in line for 15 minutes that THEY are next, not the person who just joined the single open lane with a full cart. This is one of the worst things about your store and the patrons are never ethical in allowing those who have waited the longest to go first. It sucks!
3) Get rid of the sushi section. This is a deli and nobody buys this stuff here.
4) Add more employees to the Hot Food Bar. This area takes forever if I&#39;m willing to wait and waste my time."

I have driven past this place hundreds of times and always wanted to go in, but never have. My mom brought me some prepared chicken soup from this store. My husband and I shared it before dinner one night recently. As we were eating it, we both looked at each other and said how much we loved the soup. It was so flavorful and had beautiful pieces of chicken!

When you first walk in, you will be happily surprised to find what&#39;s behind that automatic sliding door! Its a whole grocery store. I had no idea. Where has this place been?? Or better question, why have I not found this store until now?

There is a complete produce area, it&#39;s not the size of Tony&#39;s, Caputo&#39;s or Valli, but it&#39;s a decent size and has everything you need! Fresh chives, grapes, potatoes, apples, oranges, peppers, onions, ginger, you name it! The pricing was excellent on their sale items. Gala apples, for example, were $.79 per pound and a 3 lb. bag of Yukon potatoes was $1.50. 

They do not have a meat section with packaged meat like you find at your regular grocery store, all their meat is at the meat counter and you purchase as much or little as you need. They have the basics in the poultry area...chicken breasts $2.99 per lb., whole chickens, leg quarters $.99 per lb., ground chicken $2.49 per lb. and that&#39;s about it with the poultry. The beef and pork was also pretty limited, but they have the basics. Pork, Beef and Veal meat for stew cubed up. Ground veal, pork and beef. The ground beef was $3.49 per lb., while the ground pork was $1.79 per lb. They also have a full deli with a lot of Polish items but also some American basics like Munster cheese and ham. I sampled Krystyna&#39;s Baked Ham which they sell for $6.99 per lb. and it was FANTASTIC!!! 

If you are looking to grab lunch or dinner, their prepared foods area is next to the deli and you can select one main dish such as cabbage rolls or breaded pork loin and one side like potato pancakes or cabbage. A meal is $5.99 for one main dish and one side. Not bad for a complete dinner.

I briefly walked the aisles and found that a lot of items are European but most items have a label on the back side explaining what the item is and it&#39;s nutritional information. If I know anything, a lot of European items are better than some of our American products. For example, they have a chocolate cake mix that looks like it would be delicious!  I might have to pick that up next time I visit.

Speaking of cake, they have a small bakery near the back of the store across from their prepared foods area that sells Pączki&#39;s, sweet rolls, small cakes and cookies. Nothing looked particularly appealing to me they day I was there, but they had plenty of options. 

I also found an entire section of Milka bars...I&#39;m a big fan of Milka bars and there are a zillion kinds, and you rarely find more than a few flavors in a candy aisle but Krystyna&#39;s has almost every kind Milka makes!! I was impressed. I&#39;m still on the hunt for a Milka bar I found in the Amsterdam airport that had milk, white and dark chocolate all in one bar and have yet to find it in America. I searched here and sadly, they did not have this one here but they had plenty of other options!

You are not going to come here and get everything on your grocery list, but you can certainly check a majority of items off and trust that they are fresh from a store like this. I look forward to getting back to Krystyna&#39;s soon!!!"

It&#39;s a local (Chicago area) chain and the deli is huge with every kind of European based meat product you could possibly be interested in, at fair prices. The sausage is the best available anywhere. The Keilbasa is perfect,the bock and wiesswurst as excellent the chicken/pork is very fresh and the blutwurst is ...........well, it&#39;s blutwurst, not much you can do with that. Every bit as good as it can be. 
The grocery side is a fully stocked store with everything you remember from the old country. The bread comes both from outside bakers and is baked fresh (daily, and on busy days every four hours) in store. 
While the meat counter has a limited selection of fish, they have a good selection of both dried and pickled fish on the shelves. There is an entire row dedicated to pickled vegetables-mainly cucumbers but also cabbage, radishes, mushrooms etc.
There are two wooden drums with self serve sauerkraut and herring in the produce area. WOOT!
The attached wine section in addition to a small but high quality stock also has extremely high quality vodkas and spirits, however the beer is all polish with a few domestic options. 
Assuming you are not interested in cooking the deli has a full range of items ready to go ranging from soups (borscht) veg and meat dishes. 
Just about everyone speaks polish, but everyone also speaks English as well. The only tricky part is when a line is present for the deli meats and the numbers are called out in polish. Usually they figured out that my blank look indicated that I&#39;m not a polish speaker and compensated accordingly. 
Be advised that the grandmothers and grandfathers in line will dispense advice freely on your deli selections. It comes across as charming as opposed to annoying. 
This is a seriously wonderful European grocery."

So...I&#39;m not Polish. Let&#39;s just get that out of the way. However, a few of my close friends are, so I kind of feel like I am. 

Anyways, at first I thought this place was just a deli. Um, no guys. It&#39;s a grocery store, deli, bakery, and wonderful heaven of a place. You can literally get all of your grocery shopping done here. I don&#39;t know what my favorite part was. The mass amounts of meats, or the bakery with all of the freshly baked bread (that smelled amazing!!). They have all different kinds of Polish goods - from candy to kolaczkis to pierogis. You name it, they have it. And everything is really decently priced! And of course there is the barrel of, what we like to call, dirty pickles.

A big must for a large Polish Immigrant community in the the Schaumburg community. My girlfriend is Mexican and she says she lives this place as well because when she cooks, she needs vegetables and spices and they are cheap and very fresh there. Plus they are a block from my apartment. My whole family is from Poland, so I grew up with Polish beer, kielbasa, and Pierogies. Good selection and the alcohol section is unique. The alcohol has wine from countries you never heard of. Have u ever had Wine from Moldovia? Of course they do have popular wine brands as well. Zywiec.....of course they have it. No matter what your nationality is....this place is good to go too if u need fresh produce, inexpensive food, and good alcohol. Boom!"

Nevertheless you really have to watch expiration dates, freshness of food and most of all watch the cashiers at the check out. I went there yesterday and was ripped off of seven bucks. Having the whole conveyer belt loaded with items and paying $  200 worth of groceries it was hard to keep track of what the cashier ( Karolina ) was doing. I had a bag of apples ( which didn&#39;t have code number and name stickers on - another cheat ) which happened to be Honey Crisp according to the cashier. The price was around $ 7 for the whole bag. I told her I picked Gala ( at least that&#39;s what the store&#39;s price and info sheet stated underneath them ) she changed the name of apples and the price came to $ 7.18. I said I did not want the apples then. She put them aside without subtracting the price off of my bill obviously. I&#39;ve learned it at home upon checking the receipt and would&#39;ve returned to KD if I didn&#39;t live an hour away. Another issue I had yesterday was with their meat counter. I&#39;ve purchased pork fat that happened to be a pork skin you cut out and throw away anyways ( there was literally a quarter inch fat on it ). They have it rolled up in the cooler so you can&#39;t see. 
So there&#39;s NO $ 100-200  trips to KD Market in Schaumburg for me anymore. I&#39;ve warned my family and friends as well."

While combing the locale for a decent source of kielbasa, I came across Krystyna&#39;s and instantly fell in love.  

The deli section is always crowded and if the tag system is inop, get ready for mayhem. Somehow everyone stays in order, unlike the death pit at Valli&#39;s deli.  Service is friendly and served with a smile from the ladies who aren&#39;t hard to look at.

Check out the aisles for some unique Polish groceries.  I tried an Apple Mint drink that was strangely refreshing.

The liquor section is small but has a decent selection, including 90%+ alcohol spyrytus. Extensive Polish beer selection is available as well.  

They have prepared food and a bakery as well but I haven&#39;t had the chance to try either.  The food on display looks good though.

Picked up some of their house brand frozen pierogi too. Couldn&#39;t find a potato/onion pierogi like Grandma used to make, but I&#39;m sure the potato and cheese is just as good.

I liked this store and I was valuable costumer because I spent a lot of money in this place but I won&#39;t be the customer any more. When I was shopping last time the manager stopped me after I paid and told that he knows I am a good costumer and spent a lot but  that I not always pay for my groceries. Then I said that I don&#39;t  understand what he is talking about. Then he said I steal some staff and I put it to my pockets. I was shocked, humiliating and I asked him for some evidences. He said that he has videotape with me but he can&#39;t show me it.  Then I showed him my pockets and my purse to proof I didn&#39;t steal anything. I asked him to call police but he refused. He even didn&#39;t  want  tell me his name and name of owner of this store. He tread me like a shit ! I was crying and shaking, and then I called Police. When the Police officer came the manager  refused to show him the videotape and said  if I will come to this store again they will arrest me.  I am a woman in middle age and I am exceptionally honest person, I have never been arrested, I have never stolen nothing in my life and I survived trauma. I am sick because of this , they hurt my civil rights, and I don&#39;t know why, they should show me some evidences and I am sure that I could to proof that it was not me on this videotape.

The restaurant itself is very well hidden, in a strip mall and it&#39;s on the small size. I hear that it gets very busy at peak times and that there can be a wait. I came for dinner during the week so it was not too busy. 

I ordered the grigilata, which has calamari, octopus, and shrimp broiled with balsamic vinegar. It is served with eggplant and zucchini.  It tastes like it comes right off of the barbecue. It is so delicious and I highly recommend it.  It is my favorite dish on the menu. The portion is also very generous. I usually share it with friends as an appetizer.  My friend had the brilliant idea of ordering it with pasta next time so I will have to do that.

This time, it didn&#39;t have the smokey flavor that it usually does so I was a little disappointed about that.  It was still very good.  

I also ordered the spaghetti noodles with bolognese.  I like my pasta al dente and kind of chewy and this pasta was cooked just perfectly.  I also enjoyed the bolognese, which was sweet.  My friend who tried it was not as big of a fan.  I think because she does not like sweet spaghetti.  

Also, the owner stopped by our table to say hi, which I appreciated.  Our waitress was also very friendly.

Great Italian food. Highly recommend."

Sat at 745 and check given at 945. We got one appetizer , the mushrooms that were the only thing about this meal that meant anything, and still 2 hours to get our meal and check no thank you.

Service ; terrible. We literally saw our waitress three times. No water no service no anything. To say we felt like an afterthought means they at least thought of us and they did not. 

Her meal with chicken with asparagus and forget the fact that it was served in hour late The chicken looks like any of the process chicken that you get at McDonald&#39;s and asparagus was overcooked.

I get the risotto with the basically it was just a seafood Medley and it was equally awful. Pretty sure that was just rice and not risotto the clams and mussels her over cook the shrimp was tough. I was thinking this is what I see a white based milk in it was tomato-based which is fine it doesn&#39;t post to be but it also taste like rague.

After waiting an hour before we get our meal and you cannot tell me that they sat there for 2030 minutes and we&#39;re just microwaved. The fact that one have to play the sauce look like it was cold and then when you cut into the chicken in it was steaming hi kinda tells you it was microwaved.

I&#39;ve been here for take out a few times in and out in 20 minutes in the food was good. Take some way here in a day for a sitdown meal in the service is terrible and the food is all over cooked. And I like to eat. Not happy

They give you complementary powdered cakes that taste like carnival snacks and even those felt old.

All in all, it took 2 hours to get one appetizer and two entrees. Unacceptable at any venue. Much less here."

The first time I came at around 5:45pm for dinner on a Tuesday with a friend who recommended it.  Everything from the service to the food was excellent. The waitress was super friendly and we were seated right away. We ordered the grilled seafood appetizer (grigliata) and I ordered the fra diavolo with minestrone soup on the side. 

The bread that comes with the meal was roasty toasty, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. The minestrone soup was flavor and the vegetables were nice and mushy.  The grilled seafood appetizer was superb. If I had to order one dish at this restaurant, this would be it.  The pasta actually had a bite and was spicy, which I was surprised by because I have a high tolerance for spicy food.  The only complaint I had about the food was that the shrimp was overcooked and tough. The restaurant is also a bit pricey. 

During our visit, Italian families started piling in so I thought it must have been authentic Italian food.

The second time I came back for lunch with friends. I could smell the grilled seafood from the parking lot. It was actually pretty busy. The waitress let us choose our seats. We ordered the grigliata, the gnocchi with marinara, the eggplant parm, and the lobster ravioli. Lunch was slightly less expensive than dinner.

Again the grilled seafood was wonderful. It was seasoned well, the portions were generous, and it tasted like it had come straight off the barbecue. Everything else was just meh. With my side salad, I ordered garlic dressing. It was overdressed and kind of sour.  I wasn&#39;t a fan. 

I&#39;ve made eggplant parm before so I know how time consuming and labor intensive it is. The one at the restaurant was just ok. A little on the mushy side and not flavorful. The lobster ravioli was very sweet and the filling kind of reminded me of a crab rangoon. The gnocchi was bland.

I noticed the owner making rounds at all the tables but he did not stop by our table. I don&#39;t know if it was because he knew the people at the other tables or if it was because we were not Italian. This kind of upset me. I know he saw us. He just didn&#39;t take the time to say hi.

The bathroom was not wheelchair accessible.  A wheelchair cannot fit in it. It&#39;s also a bit hard to maneuver around because the restaurant is small and the tables are close together. Luckily we sat at a table right by the door.

I would definitely go back for grigliata but I&#39;m not so sure about the other dishes."

The food made up for the so-so service.The bread was excellent and the olive oil was fresh. The food came out piping hot. The chicken marsala was excellent and I highly recommend it.  The owner came around and was very friendly.  The portions were a good size so as to not overwhelm you, but not to leave you hungry either.  My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our meals and will certainly be back.  Authentic Sicilian style Italian food!!!!  I only wish they could serve hard liquor. They serve beer and wine."

My mom and I went for lunch. We started with a bottle of wine, of course, along with the portabello mushroom appetizer which was very flavorful and to die for!

We ordered 2 entrees and decided to split them both so we could both have different tastes. We got the lobster ravioli which gaff a delicious shrimp sauce with little pieces of shrimp in it, and the chicken ortalano which included artichokes and asparagus with a light lemon cream sauce. Delicious. I highly recommend both entrees.

Aside from the great food was the great owner who kept checking on us and even sang and danced as he delivered us fresh watermelon for dessert. He sat with us and talked with us for awhile. He was very friendly and professional!

Ill definitely be back!"

She declined an offer of something else.  Smart move. The lasagna was warm, at best, with a runny, orange sauce. The service was abrupt and impatient.  The patrons were loud and rough.

Wouldn&#39;t know what the food tastes like, because we walked out of the place when we saw that the prices were up to $7 more on the dine-in menu, than the menu on the website. The menu online was apparently only for take out, but doesn&#39;t specify that at all, nor is there an alternate &#34;dine-in&#34; menu on the website. When we brought it up to the host, she didn&#39;t seem phased by the issue or the fact that we were leaving, so we didn&#39;t bother to stay. 

Reservation system was a hand-written list on a scrap sheet of paper and there was really nowhere to wait for a table. Waitstaff was running around and after 5 minutes sitting at our table, nobody had said a word to us... overall seemed rather disorganized. If the front of the house is disorganized, can&#39;t imagine what goes on in the back. 

If you have patience, maybe check the place out - food might be decent (but likely not worth the ridiculous upcharge for &#34;dine-in&#34;). If not... probably a good idea to stay away from this one.

Also, I guess a word to whoever makes or types the menus... it&#39;s Chicken Piccata, not Chicken &#34;Picante&#34;... unless you&#39;re using Pace in an Italian dish."

Comes to take our order and does everything at one time, drinks, dinner, the whole thing. Food comes out and it was just so-so and barely any pasta with the chicken parm. About 7 pieces of pasta.  I guess I should of just ordered pasta alone because that was better than the Chicken parm. Seemed like if you weren&#39;t a regular here you didn&#39;t fit in. We probably won&#39;t be back.

The good- the people were wonderful. Sweet , attentive and helpful. The bread was delicious.  The place was packed with an over 65 set. 

The Bad- the food. My chicken Marsala seemed to use canned mushrooms a flavorless sauce and the chicken was full of gristle. The seafood risotto was a sloppy smelly mess. We sent it back. We got a serving of their homemade lasagne. We ate half to be nice and threw the rest away at home. 

The food was flavorless and unappealing.  There is nothing traditional about this place.

The specials haven&#39;t changed once in the last 3 years and the only two soups that are offered are ALWAYS minestrone and escarole.  The service has been dicey the last few times I went, stupid things like running out of bread,  and portions have been getting smaller and smaller over the last two years. Well, I went with my friend and husband earlier this week and it will be my last time ever. I&#39;ll elaborate...  

Since, a soup or salad comes with each entree, I ordered the minestrone soup. Something was off because it had a bitter metallic taste. My husband decided on the chicken Parmesan and my friend ordered the clams with linguine in a white wine sauce. I asked the waitress what was better, the stuffed gnocchi or regular. She recommended the stuffed. Well, they brought mine out and I had exactly 15 gnocchi on my plate. My friend noticed right away what a skimpy amount it was. I asked the waitress if they accidentally gave me a half order. NOPE. That was the normal amount. When Pasquale (the owner and head chef) came out from the kitchen and asked how everything was, I mentioned this. He told me &#34;you should have told the waitress&#34;, when I said &#34;I did on fact tell her&#34;. His response: &#34;well.... (Long pause) ...stuffed gnocchi is more expensive.&#34; Oh really!? I spent 16.95 on this order that has no meat based or seafood in it and you are telling me it&#39;s to expensive? Well, I value my money and not being cheated and if you as a restaurant owner are going to try to pull my leg like that, then I am no longer a customer. I am DONE. My husbands parm chicken was soggy and tasted of old oil and my friend&#39;s seafood pasta had a small lake of watery white wine sauce in the bottom of her bowl. When I want Italian food from now on, I&#39;ll be bringing my business to Toscana Restaurant. Goodbye Joe &amp; Giuseppe restaurant forever!"

It was life changing.  The clams were the best I have had in over 25 years.  The breading was so tasty and the clams the CLAMS were tender and succulent.  Then I had the lobster ravioli and again YUM that vodka sauce will be in my dreams.  If I was a prisoner this would be my last meal!

Very good service, but very cramped space.  If you can get there on a weekday you&#39;ll be less crowded.

We have dined at the restaurant and also ordered to go.  We noticed that ordering to go is actually quite a bit cheaper than dining in -- not really sure why that is, since the portions don&#39;t seem to be different at all.  Either way, the prices aren&#39;t bad (but the to-go prices are TRULY a steal, so if you live close and want a good Italian meal at home, Joe and Giuseppe&#39;s is a great pick).

My favorites are the grilled calamari (SO tender, fresh, and delicious) and the linguine with mussels in red sauce.  They are both fantastic dishes.

The service is great too -- when we dined in our waitress was extremely helpful and attentive.  They bring you a little freshly fried pastry dish dusted with powdered sugar at the end of the meal.

I would definitely recommend trying this spot out for a romantic date night (either in the restaurant or bringing it back home)."

Heading into this place, my expectations were way off.  I had expected an upscale Italian bistro type of place.  That&#39;s not what this is.
We arrived around 6:00-6:30pm on a Satuday and were surprised that the place was already packed and there was a substantial wait.
The good thing was that the place turned over pretty quickly.
The folks leaving were older and clearly been there for an early dinner.  I suspect that this is typical.

What Joe &amp; Guiseppe reminds me of is old, homemade Italian dishes.  We had veal Marsala, pasta with mussels and eggplant Parmesan.
The veal was quite good with just the right amount of seasoning.  At other places I&#39;ve noticed that Marsala can get overly salty.  Not the case here.  
The mussels were excellent. Large and fresh, they swam in a light tomato sauce with some traditional Italian spices like oregano, basil etc..
The eggplant parm was a bit disappointing.  Overly bready and a bit soggy with a tomato sauce that verged on orange versus red in color.

So, here&#39;s the thing, everything was good.  Not exceptional, but solid.  The tomato sauce is not the bright red, tangy, &#34;just picked&#34; kind of sauce you will get in more upscale restaurants.  And that&#39;s actually good too.
J&amp;G is really more like what you would have been served when visiting your friend&#39;s house and his mom invited you to stay for dinner.

So, I&#39;ve recalibrated my expectations and really do recommend Joe and Guiseppe.
Go in expecting home cooked Italian fare that will make you think back to your childhood.

Good stuff, we&#39;ll be back."

First, don&#39;t even think of trying to get a table in this tiny restaurant without a reservation. You will be stuck standing outside or crushed near the front door waiting for a table if you don&#39;t have a reservation and on weekends they&#39;ve actually told us a table was not a possibility. Second, this is not a quiet restaurant. On a recent visit we inquired twice about the incredibly loud banging that never stopped and were told it was the dishwasher. Between the banging dishwasher and your fellow diners in a small space, this is not a restaurant for easy conversation. 
However the food is consistently good and the service while not attentive is friendly. They will not rush you through your meal and portions are large. There is no bar but glasses of wine are poured generously. Owner Pasquale is often found mingling with his customers and is easy to talk too when he&#39;s not in the kitchen.

The owner, Pasquale, is Sicilian  so the menu consists of more southern Italian dishes. The restaurant itself lacks ambiance and its location in an ugly strip mall on an industrial part of Arthur is less than ideal. But it more than makes up for these negatives in its food and warmth. My husband always orders the &#39;grigliata&#39; (grilled seafood) and really likes it. He&#39;s Parisian so is very particular about his food. I&#39;ve had various chicken and pasta dishes and found all to be &#39;ottimi&#39;. They serve complimentary fried dough dusted in powdered sugar and its really light, not at all greasy. They sell this dough at Mariano&#39;s but Pasquale&#39;s is so much better. We had an Italian neighbor growing up who used to make batches of this and call all the kids in the neighborhood over. Pasquale&#39;s reminds me of that. They also grow their own herbs out back and Pasquale has brought us samples of soups with some greens he grows.

It&#39;s getting rarer and rarer to find owner vs. corporate restaurants and we try to support these assets to the community. You leave Joe and Giuseppe&#39;s feeling good, not empty as you sometimes do after going to some chain ethnic restaurant."

Come early or make a reservation, it gets crowded quickly on a Saturday evening and it is not a large place.  Definitely good value  and nice dinner for the money."

Took the waitress 10mins to greet us (not even with a smile) and she basically through us the menus.  Then another 10mins went by nothing, no contact, no drink order nothing.  Ended up getting up an walking out.   Hopefully the owner is reading this.  You just lost probably a $150 tab by your awful service.  Really need to improve this because your food is good."

It is family owned and the size of the restaurant is relatively small but that is why it is comfortable as we can &#39;talk&#39; (some restaurants are just too noisy to talk and enjoy atmosphere.)

I&#39;ve been there 3 or 4 times over the last 2 years and I&#39;ve yet to have a good experience with a waitress. 

On my most recent visit we had some bread and had our water glass refilled before I had to ask someone if we had a waitress. If I want my dining experience to last 2 hours I want to do it on my own accord, not because it took the waitress 20 minutes to bring us the check (and 20 more minutes to run the credit card...)

I feel bad giving a 2 star review to a neighborhood restaurant but terrible service is too hard to overlook."

The location was kind of odd for a restaurant. It seems to be mixed in with a business district.  

The inside was cozy.  There were a fair amount of people there and it was not too noisy where we sat which was nice.  

We all came to the conclusion that the food was just ok.  It was fresh, but the taste could have been better.  

I checked the website menu before I went there and it does not seem to match the one we had at the restaurant. The choices are different and the prices are higher.  

The service was ok.  The food did not come out very fast, but that gave us some time to talk.  

At the end they do give you complimentary fried dough with powdered sugar.  

Overall it was ok, but I would not rush back."

It was a wonderful event and one of the most glorious parts was the delightful smell that came through the house when the catering order arrived.  Lasagna, spaghetti, meatballs, all kinds of delights!  The smells and tastes reminded me of the homes of friends/family with Italian moms instantly bringing me back to my childhood.  Flash forward to yesterday.  My cousin and I decided to go to dinner.  I just had to check out the restaurant.  What a great place!  We got there around 8pm on a Thursday so it was not too crowded.  We were immediately sat down and brought water and menus.  The waitress informed us that some fresh baked bread would be out shortly.  Oh boy, this was going to be great!  The place is small and charming.  It seemed like the kind of place where everyone kind of new each other.  Also, someone Pasquale (owner/chef) knew was on the XFactor, America&#39;s Got Talent or one of those kind of shows so everyone was drawn to the TV which made the evening more interesting.  We enjoyed many delights...
Fresh baked bread (complementary with our meal)
Bruschetta
Minestrone soup
Cheese ravioli with bolognese
Cheese ravioli with spicy marinara
Meatballs
Cookies with powdered sugar (complementary with our meal)
Hazelnut gelato
Tiramisu
Cannoli
I know this seems a little excessive for two people but, I really wanted to try all the delights.  We really chowed down and took home lots of leftovers.  Already ate them for breakfast!  If I wanted to save money I would skip appetizer, dessert and the side of meatballs and would still have a full meal.  That being said with all we ate and one glass of wine our bill was $62.02 which I thought was very reasonable.  This did not include the Hazelnut gelato which Pasquale gave to us complementary as he knew my cousin.  Before we left he said a very friendly good bye and I could not help but, give him a hug for such a wonderful dinner.  I can&#39;t wait to go back with my husband for date night.  BTW-if you have kids who are picky eaters like mine, they do not offer a kids menu.  My kids are super picky but, I probably still could take them here and have them fill up on bread and dessert.  They would just rather go to a place that offers chicken fingers.  Those silly boys."

It was a pleasant experience. But for the 2nd experience...not so much. I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and  we got greeted at the door and sat down at our table. No one came to ask us if we wanted drinks or anything,my boyfriend had to ask a waitress to get him something to drink. Then we waited for OVER 20 MINUTES and NO ONE came to serve us. I had to get up and tell the host that we haven&#39;t even ordered our food yet. She apologized and got someone to serve us and then mentioned that we would get free desert. Now the waiter that served us walked by our table a handful of times and ALWAYS turned her head..then had the nerve to say that she &#34;didn&#39;t&#34; know that we were her table! Ha! Now, my boyfriend is African American and I have NEVER EVER HAD SUCH BAD SERVICE IN MY LIFE. It shouldn&#39;t matter the skin tone of someone, we came to YOUR restaurant to eat and YOU should serve us. I have never ever experienced such a thing..to wait and have a bunch of waiters walk by our table. I am completely disgusted and will never consider coming back to this place nor will I ever recommend this place! This wasn&#39;t our first time and will definitely be our last!

They serve it with a cocktail sauce and I would have preferred marinara. Our server suggested a great red wine and our meals were straight-up awesome! Both of our entrees were so huge there were about 4 portions for a moderately hungry person. Eggplant parm was great and fettuccine siliciane was also fantastic! The pasta was cooked perfectly. 

The downsides: it&#39;s a really cramped, tiny dining area. We felt like we were at a big family dinner which was fun but not a romantic place. I also saw several of the kitchen staff go into the bathroom with their aprons on which is pretty gross to me but the food and wine were so good I can overlook it."

We love to take our friends here because they love the home made food.  My husband always gets the giambotta (Italian sausage, peppers, onions and potatoes).  I love to get the eggplant parmesan.  
It is always tender and delicious. Sometimes I get the Sicilian appetizer and have that for my meal since it is so big (and still take home half of it).
One of our friend&#39;s favorite dish is the chicken ortolano.  Another friend loves the lasagna.  The bruschetta is to die for - though the home-made bread that comes with the meal is great, also.  The minestrone soup is so tasty.  And the desserts are delicious - though we rarely have room. The owner, Pasquale,
comes out when he can to greet people but his tiime is very limited since he is the chef.

We had a large anniversary party and had it catered by Joe &amp; Giuseppe.  I am SO glad we did. We ordered lasagna, sausage with peppers and meatballs.  Everyone raved about it.   It was such a highlight of our evening.  They do a HUGE take-out service."

It is in a small strip mall off of the main road, but pretty easy to find. Once you walk in, you see that there are only a few tables and the the crowd was definitely quiet and over the age of 40. We were told to seat ourselves.

There were two waitresses working (it was a Thursday night), but you could not tell because the service was great. The meal starts with freshly baked (or in my guess, rewarmed) bread with oil on the table for dipping. The bread was great!

We skipped appetizers this time because were in a little bit of a hurry. I had the Fettuccine Giuseppe, which is chicken strips (not fried) in fettuccine with a great white wine and what tasted like broth sauce. It was SO good. My wife had the lobster ravioli and not only cleared her plate, but was dipping bread into the sauce afterward because it  was delicious! Also, they each came with soup or salad. She got the salad and I got their minestrone (which was also very good).

There were several other dishes that we were deciding between, which means we are definitely have to go back. I do not know much about wines (yet) but they had a two-page wine menu attached to their regular menu.

It was a nice touch when the chef came out to talk to us. That is always refreshing in any restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back again. Our total bill for the two meals (soups and salad included) and a glass of wine was $43ish."

I don&#39;t know why, but I go in expecting the worst.  I was very pleasantly surprised by Joe and Guiseppe.

The menu is mostly basic Italian comfort food - pastas, as well as several meat and seafood dishes.  Two of us had pasta with marinara and a side of Italian sausage, one had the lobster ravioli, and I had the eggplant parmesan.  Entrees come with soup or salad, and we all opted for salad with creamy garlic dressing (note: they don&#39;t normally have the garlic dressing, but the waitresses will whip it up for you - and it&#39;s great!).  All our entrees were generous portions, and very well done.  We were far too full to order dessert, but they served up a complimentary plate of cookies.  

While the place was VERY busy starting at like 5:30 on a Saturday night, the service was great, and the staff never made you feel rushed.

We started out with the calamari ($14.95 which I thought was a little high). A couple of bites into the dish I thought it was very fishy tasting. My boyfriend agreed. We debated sending it back ( I always feel bad!) but the chef&#39;s wife (owner maybe?) came by and asked how our dish was.  I told her that I thought it was fishy. She asked if we would like something else.  We declined (my stomach was upset now). She took the dish away and came back to tell us she was taking the dish off our bill. She said her husband (the chef) had tried it and said it tasted fine. She than said &amp;quot;I just think it&#39;s you.&amp;quot; I was in shock that she would say something like this to her customer.

Went there last night for the first time in years and was not impressed. When we get there it was busy at 8 pm we did get seated right away but then the host thought it was more important to talk to a freind about a stiry then give us menus. So we were brought water and bread before the menus that came 10 mins after we git there. The waitress didn&#39;t show up until 5 mins after that.  I had the garden salad with the &#34;house&#34; dressing which consisted of evoo and red wine vinegar. There was a pool of rwv at the bottom. Way over dressed. There was no other seasoning to the dressing at all no pepper or any other herbs.  I got the chicken parm with mosticcoli.  There was more breading then chicken it was so thin. Salernos is way better u can tell there is chicken. The pasta was fine but there were no ridges on it so the sauce doesn&#39;t stay on. My husband got the chicken vesuvio and i did like that but not a big portion of chicken for 15.95. Our bill was $46 with tip with 1 soda. Overall not a pleasant experience and i doubt i will go back.

Their were also two boys that were part of the family that were arguing/fighting quite loudly for such a small place. If you&#39;re looking for some good Italian food in the suburb area I&#39;d say this is the place, as long as you don&#39;t mind on lookers. I&#39;ll definitely venture back here one of these days."

This was the first sign that they don&#39;t know how to manage a restaurant. Once seated we waited almost 20 min for a waitress to even take a drink order. We asked the hostess/manager after 10 min but that didn&#39;t seem to help much. While our waitress was very nice, I&#39;m not sure if she had too many tables, was distracted, or what the problem was. Clearly she wasn&#39;t being supervised.  We waited nearly 30 min for our check when we were finished and had to ask multiple people at least 3 times for it. Meanwhile people are lining up outside waiting for tables. The hostess should have been on top of this situation - this was a case study in How Not to Run a Restaurant 101. It took from start to finish over 2 hours for a fairly simple meal. The food was ok, some big hits some misses, but after such poor service I&#39;m not sure we would come back. Hire a new front manager and we might be back, until then we&#39;ll take a pass."

When we arrived at the restaurant and I looked at the menu, the prices averaged $5.00-$6.00  higher on each entree than what was listed on the website.  Yikes!

ramen-misoya-mount-prospect,Anthony K.,uwavnlkvnttiDEbrNXYgvA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,9,46,pW3OvjIgmoShAbV-UTjUOQ,5.0,2016-11-17,"I have been to this establishment many times. This past time I brought my significant other. We had been watching an anime where the main character eats a lot of ramen, so we both had a taste for it. My partner had never had actual ramen (just top ramen) and I wanted him to experience what I can actually be like. I have been to a few ramen places (like Slurping Turtle in Chicago) but none of them compare to Ramen Misoya.

The restaurant itself is a chain from Japan, so it&#39;s safe to say it is at least a little more authentic than the posh ramen restaurants you&#39;ll find in the city. Whenever I have gone there&#39;s been at least a 10min wait to be seated. The inside of the restaurant is a little different than most places one might be used to. There are the typical table seating areas, but then there is also bar seating. The bar in this case isn&#39;t alcohol related, but instead you&#39;re sitting around the area where the chefs are cooking the food. When you walk in to be seated the chefs all yell to welcome you in as a Japanese tradition.

The menu is not extensive but you don&#39;t need it to be. There are 4 different types of ramen, and every once in a while they will have a special ramen that isn&#39;t typically on the menu. As for the different types of ramen, you can&#39;t really go wrong. Each one of them tastes delicious, but you&#39;ll want to read the ingredients to make sure you&#39;re getting something you want. Some come with potato wedges, some with clam, others with corn. The main attraction in each dish is the broth. Each ramen choice has it&#39;s own flavor of broth. I personally prefer the Hokkaido ramen which has a rich savory miso flavor. The Kyoto ramen is good if you prefer a sweeter broth, and the Tonkotsu is good if you like a fishy broth (from the clams). I&#39;ve only ever had the Nagoya once, but I can&#39;t remember how it tasted. I know it was good and not at all bad like I was expecting (the flavor on the menu is described as bitter) so do not be afraid to order it.

My tip is to 100% get the extra noodles option. It&#39;s a cheap add on, but it makes a big difference if you&#39;re looking to be stuffed when you finish the ramen. Adding other ingredients to the ramen off their list is fun too, but I prefer to just order the ramen as its &#34;Cha-Shu&#34; version. This adds 3 pieces of extremely tender and very delicious pork to the soup. It makes the price more expensive, but I find that it is worth it if you really want to enjoy the ramen to its fullest.

Overall I love this restaurant and if it was closer to me then I would be eating here weekly. Nothing beats coming here on a cold day to be warmed up by some delicious ramen. I hope that Ramen Misoya starts to open up locations elsewhere. I think this place could be a mega hit in the city."

Got the spicy and it was powdered spice instead of paste this time. My last visit was during the winter so I&#39;m not sure when the spicy version changed. It packed a punch regardless. 
I was excited to see that they had Tsukemen. However, asking the waitress a couple questions, it doesn&#39;t sound like what I&#39;ve had before. I didn&#39;t see it on any tables so can&#39;t be sure. The waitress said that it was the same noodles as the ramen, didn&#39;t know if the broth was prepared differently and didn&#39;t come with lime. 
I&#39;ll give it a try on a future visit but was in the mood for a proven winner with the Shiro miso. Side note: despite putting my name down twice, they crossed my name off without calling my party. Had a 15 minute wait at 12:30 Wednesday."

I say try something different. It a great shop with lots of options and pricing is killer. Not gonna break your wallet type of price. 

I always get extra pork because i love the taste.

Misoya has locations worldwide and Michelin recommended. For around $12 a bowl, it&#39;s no wonder this place has 45 minute wait times. 

All of the broths are miso based hence the name, Misoya. Each broth varies with the use of white, yellow, and red miso so be prepared. This is a thicker broth that tends to be stronger in umami and overall saltier than your lighter clear broths. For added toppings, make sure to get their famous cha-shu which is thinly cut marinated pork belly that&#39;s been grilled. 

Get the tonkotsu ramen. It&#39;s a broth cooked with pork bones for 15 hours that produces a rich creamy unctuous broth. It&#39;s so rich that you&#39;ll be able to taste pork fat on the top of your mouth afterwards. You won&#39;t see this type of ramen broth often since it takes a long time to cook and intense piggy flavor. 

Be healthy and eat your miso."

I ordered the kyoto style ramen and takoyaki. The food came pretty quickly and I started enjoying my meal. But I think they&#39;re A/C was broken that day because it was veryyyy hot inside. And as I was eating the piping hot ramen it started to become uncomfortable. The ramen was delicious and the soup base was flavorful and not too salty. I didn&#39;t like the chashu as much...it wasn&#39;t as tender as other ramen joints. I ate about half my bowl due to the heat and couldn&#39;t eat anymore without feeling sick. 

The takoyaki had more filler than actual octopus. The flavor with the sauces were good though. 

Overall, not a great experience but I attribute it mostly to the A/C not working..and I couldn&#39;t fully enjoy my meal."

I&#39;ll state my reasons below. Again I&#39;m writing as someone from out-of-state and have the privilege of enjoying a good bowl of ramen anytime in LA. I can&#39;t help it but be really critical. 

Located in a very dark neighborhood with not much street lights. The night was drizzling and cold. Perfect moment for ramen. Waited for over 30 mins to get seated. 

Comment by stars: 
-the Asian lady host was so friendly with every customer. Her smile and hospitality are probably why many pple keep coming back. (4 stars)
-Got the Hokkaido Ramen: was pre-warned it&#39;s very salty. Heck, the soup base was rather salty. I was upset by the thickness of the chasu pork. I noticed the grilled marks may have led the meat to taste a bit tough and not as tender. (2 stars)
-Potato wedges in the ramen: I&#39;m not a big fan of potatoes, but still why would you want to ruin a bowl of ramen by throwing in 2 large potato wedges?? (1 star)
-Chicken karaage: I actually like this dish as it did taste like chicken. Many places tend to over deep fry it. (3 stars)

Parking: small lot."

This place was one of my many bookmarks for the area so decided to swing by around 11:10 on a Sunday and saw around 10 people in line already for their 11:30 opening.  At 11:43 the restaurant was about 90% full.  

 If you&#39;re not familiar with ramen just know that this restaurant has a few different ramens for those who aren&#39;t exactly sure what to get.  Want more vegetables in your ramen? There&#39;s a bowl for that.  Want more spice and extra chashu? There&#39;s a bowl for that.  The broth is salty goodness and the noodles are just the perfect chewiness.  Ramen to me is one of those mystical food items.  I&#39;ll know when it&#39;s horrible but for the most part, I love every kind and don&#39;t over judge such a simple dish.  Once you start dissecting it, you&#39;ll miss out on the food experience.  Just eat the damn bowl and accept the fact that the magical bowl of ramen that a lot of critics are comparing every bowl to is probably doesn&#39;t exist.  Or they were really drunk when they ate it and you know, everything tastes awesome when you&#39;ve had one too many IPAs.  

I ordered the spicy Tokyo ramen with an added egg (a must) and a small order of chicken karaage. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I was starving at this point but the chicken karaage had lots of flavor.  It was salty and perfectly fried with a light batter and served with a delicious creamy sauce to dip it in.  Definitely paired well with my bowl of ramen, which you can guess was also perfect. I&#39;m excited to take ramen noobs here just because there is a variety to choose from.

My whole lunch was $17 and it was sooooo worth it.  I wasn&#39;t expecting a wait when i pulled up but understand why there was one."

This place specializes in various types of miso ramen.  There&#39;s actually a store location in NYC around Saint Marks that I&#39;m aware of, but unfortunately I haven&#39;t had the chance to visit that one.

I ordered the Kome cha-shu ramen.  The portion was extremely generous (3 large slices of cha-shu) and the noodles were cooked just right.  However, the broth was simply too salty for my palette.  Just for reference, it&#39;s definitely not the first time that I&#39;ve had miso.  I get that it&#39;s naturally salty, but this was just too much for my taste.  The cha-shu was also too tough and salty as well.

I actually only ate less than a quarter of the bowl and had to abandon ship after that...  Maybe I&#39;m just not cut out for miso ramen...

If you like your food on the salty side, perhaps this place would be good for you..."

I was pleased to find pages worth of miso ramen here. It took me and my husband 10 minutes to decide what to order (most of it was because I was being indecisive, but still... lots of options!). If I was rating this place solely on their ramen noodles, it would get an easy 5 stars. The noodles are a bit thicker than the usual, but has great consistency. Now the broth is where things got a little disappointing for me. I ordered the &#39;Spicy Tokyo Miso Tonkotsu&#39; which was not quite spicy for me, but more on the salty side. The broth was also a bit greasier than I had liked. Maybe the other ramen choices are better? Not sure if I would come back to try out the others... It&#39;s close enough to Mitsuwa (less than a 5 minute drive), but if I had the choice, I would choose Santouka Ramen at Mistuwa food court instead.

We also ordered a side of gyoza which was also a disappointing &#39;meh&#39;... ramen shop gyozas are my favorite, so I do tend to get a bit picky especially with its crispy-ness. I can tell you this place had no crispy-ness but a lot of soggy-ness. 

FYI... the cha-shu (pork) slices are HUGE here, unlike other ramen shops. I saw that the &#39;Tokyo Miso Tonkotsu&#39; came with one piece of cha-shu (seems typical for most of the ramens to come with one), but I ordered another slice thinking one wouldn&#39;t be enough. I was SO wrong!! The slices are not only big, but also thick so one should fill you up very quickly!"

My husband ordered their Chicken Karage and pot stickers with a side of steamed rice.  I had the miso ramen with vegetables and ground pork.  While he didn&#39;t care much for the pot stickers he did love the chicken a lot.  My ramen wast really tasty - a touch on the salty side... But just a touch.

They have a very specialized menu focusing on miso-based ramen.  There are a variety of sides and appetizers, but for mains it is ramen and nothing but!  You can get Hokkaido, Kyoto, or Nagoya-style broth with the same four basic ramen dishes, or you can get tonkatsu ramen if you don&#39;t want any of those.  For our first trip we stuck with the more basic Kyoto ramen.  My husband is the bigger ramen fan between the two of us and he described it as amazing and as good as what we had in Japan.

Went here with the love of my life, on a date, when I went to go visit him. Now the only type of ramen I&#39;ve ever had is maruchans top ramen (which is not only super bad for you, but its shit compared to this).  We had an itch lately to have ramen: first, because it&#39;s one of his favorites; and second because we&#39;ve been watching Naruto and that boy eats a lot of ramen - and makes it look so damn good.

This place is a little pricer, but not by too much. I suggest getting everything in your ramen, and ORDER EXTRA NOODLES! I know it&#39;s a whole $1.50 more, but then you get a shit ton MORE noodles, which makes it soooo much more worth it! I also got the eggs, for extra, and they tasted good - nothing special, but it adds another element to the soup.

Now the thing I enjoyed about eating ramen, for the first time, is all the variety in the bowl!!!!
1. the potatoes are SO FREAKING DAMN GOOD!!!!!!!!!!! (you get them only with select ramen bowls)
2. the eggs (additional cost) are good too, and add an element of taste and texture
3. ground pork is OKAY, not a huge fan - didn&#39;t add or subtract from flavor to me
4. bean sprouts are DA BOMB, love em love em love em
5. ramen itself was delicious
6. pork chops taste so wonderful - try eating these slowly

See, variety! Lots of variety in one bowl.
Perfect for dates. Service is good (though there&#39;s a preference for asians - they get speedier service). Prices are good. Wait times are good, first come first served. Small restaurant, so there&#39;s usually a line - sign up when you walk in and they&#39;ll call you after a short while.

Definitely a favorite, and I highly recommend!"

Reading material while I sit at the communal counter bar waiting for my food to come out with an atrocious cold and runny nose. (I am terribly sorry for the couple sitting next to me if they got sick later that week.)

Point 6. Green onion miso soup is effective in fighting the cold by allowing excessive heat to be released. Perfect!

Other health benefits:
- eliminates those pesticide coated foods we eat
- reduces allergies (No more sneezing, itching, watery eyes, stuffed sinuses)
- miso is good in digestion (I feel a bowel movement going...or maybe I&#39;m just too full)
- prevents cancer?! (another reason to eat more)
- miso fermentation = essential vitamins (No more popping multivitamins, kidding!)
- strengthens immune system (I feel like this cold is neverending...)
- removes heavy metals from the body, including radiation? (Detox. detox. detox.)
- antioxidant - prevent dementia &amp; Alzheimer&#39;s (Maybe it&#39;ll help with my forgetfulness.)
- increases metabolism and blood flow (Sweat it off. Less working out. Reason to be lazy.)

Order&#39;s up!
Tako yaki app:
6 crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside ping-pong sized balls stuffed with an octopus cube topped with shaved bonito flakes and seaweed sprinkles dressed in mayo and a sweet takoyaki glaze. Yum!

Hokkaido style (Kome miso) chashu ramen for him:
Stronger/fuller bodied broth. That pork! So divine! Perfectly charred on the grill, more meat than fat, 3 slices medium thickness. Crispy potatoes gave it a nice texture. Very generous portion for under $13. 

Kyoto style (Shiro miso) yasai ramen for me:
Lighter/natural broth. Ground pork with lots of veggies (although, I think they forgot to put a scoop of corn in mine like the menu says, now that I look at it!) Love the tofu puffs which soaks up the miso broth like a sponge. Cabbage, I could pass on. I highly regret not getting the chashu with it at this point. I thought it was going to be flavorless, fatty, mushy pork like I&#39;ve had at other places.

Note for next time: Get extras like the miso egg with the perfectly cooked yolk, crisp tofu, and butter. Those few $ are totally worth it.

I had pretty average expectations for Ramen Misoya since the menu seemed so limited and it was out in the burbs. Proved me wrong for sure. Looking forward to our next visit!"

This place has some of the best ramen I&#39;ve tasted. I hate that you have to pay like $1.50 extra for a freaking egg but it wouldn&#39;t be the same without it. We also got an appetizer or calamari and the fried chicken. We dashed a little bit of curry powder on the chicken (which they charged us an extra $0.50 for) but it was so good! Lightly battered but fresh and crunchy. The calamari was lightly battered as well, tender and flavorsful. Not too chewy. The noodles in the ramen were so fresh and the broth in it was amazing. A little of the salty side but not over powering. 

It definitely gets hot in this place. Not sure if they have AC? So when it&#39;s hot outside, you can bet it&#39;s hot in here and humid. Seating area Is small, very small. They have maybe 5 tables that seat 4 at each and of course the bar top. Very little room to move in. They have a little waiting room with chairs to sit at while you wait for a table to ready for you. Of course, a fan blowing in case it&#39;s hot haha! Definitely worth the wait though."

My friend got the spicy broth and that was quite delicious. The noodles were a bit thick and very chewy but the pork, bamboo shoots, and egg were delicious.

The atmosphere is great though. I love the bench around the bar/kitchen area.  It reminded me of a traditional restaurant in Japan. The server is incredibly nice and helpful too.  

If I go back, I would try the tonkotsu ramen since I&#39;m hoping the pork bone based broth won&#39;t be as salty."

When we yelped ramen and I picked out this place we were singing hallelujah. The spicy ramen tonkotsu is the best! Their ramen bowls are truly worth the money you spend! For the first time ever my husband took home leftovers, yeah, they serve you that much! 

The servers are also very nice and are helpful, they could tell it was our first time and helped us choose. The space inside the restaurant could get cramped but we went on a Saturday around 2 with no wait. 

I feel like I would be able to eat their ramen everyday! Now only if it was more closer to Kenosha :("

I&#39;ve only had &#34;real&#34; ramen a handful of times. There were 3 different styles, so we asked about the difference, and were told that the first two pages were what we should probably go with.

I ordered a spicy ramen (Hokkaido style I believe), which was okay, but perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have stirred the chili in, since the spice ended up overwhelming every other flavor. The pork was good. The three pieces of tofu were good. The two eggs I ordered were good. There were very few veggies: a few pieces of bamboo shoots and green onion (where are the bean sprouts and corn?). The only plus is that I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day.

As far as appetizers, my +1 had mentioned something about some sweet potato fries offered at Japanese ramen places.  I didn&#39;t see them on the menu and asked (nope), so we ordered the fries as they were listed on the menu. I was thinking they&#39;d have some interesting twist:  maybe battered in tempura?  Side of Qupie mayo? Turns out they were nothing more than plain wedge fries served with ketchup. Skip those. Totally, totally skip french fries! Why are normal french fries even offered?!  Madness; gahhhh!

The octopus balls were plentiful with drizzles of eel sauce (?) and something else.  They were very hot and pretty delicious, but the octopus inside was very tiny. 

The guy (owner&#39;s son?) who took our order was friendly and personable when he was at our table, but that persona immediately switched off as soon as he left.  I like when service isn&#39;t overbearing, but he wasn&#39;t even checking on patrons: I never once saw him scan the dining room to see if anyone needed anything.  I was looking in his direction multiple times to see if I could cue him that we needed boxes and the check, but nothing.  I ended up having to catch him - before he walked by again - after he was at the table behind us.

The seal of this 3-star deal was the dirty bathrooms. I can understand a toilet maybe being defiled by a previous patron and going unnoticed, but the floor was dirty.  If you don&#39;t mop your bathroom floor, how can I trust you&#39;re cleaning your kitchen?

I had such high hopes for Ramen Misoya based on all of the glowing reviews and pictures, but feel I got the short end of the stick.  So disappointing!"

The service and food was just superb. The staff was all smiles and came to check on us at the right times. The Ramen broth was the perfect saltiness to my liking. The broth, pork, noodles and veggies complimented one another that it was hard to put down my fork and spoon. I added shrimp which I took out and placed to the side right away to avoid it was getting soggy. It was a nice touch since it added a slight crunch to the savory soup. 

I was a bit skeptical since the waiting area wasn&#39;t the nicest, but my mind quickly changed upon walking into the restaurant. While it was rather small and simply decorated, it was very   clean and welcoming. 

A few tips: go a few mins before it actually opens b/c a line forms rather quickly. They have a sign in sheet right past the first door. Review the menu ahead of time to save time once seated.  Seating is limited and the largest table only seats 6, so limit your party size. Come hungry as the bowls are fairly large and very filling.

Excited to go back and try more."

My favorite order is shiro miso spicy with extra spicy with 3 peice pork for ramen, and a large side of chicken karage.  Another good suggestion would be go during off peak hours, however if you considering going during when its busy the wait is never more than 20-30min atleast in my experience.  If you know of these very good little restaurants, there is a good reason why they are busy and that there is a wait. The staff is incredible, a must visit if your in the area"

They didn&#39;t disappoint.  Absolutely the best Ramen I&#39;ve had stateside.  I&#39;ve had dozens of different places and styles and this is the best.  

One thing of note is the choices.  It&#39;s only about 5 different ways.  But the add-ons make it customizable, but be wary adding too much destroys the taste and will up the price significantly.

I had the spicey, and for me it was perfect.  Just remove some spice paste before stiring, you can always add more if it&#39;s not to your liking.

It is a restaurant with limited seating. I think I only got a seat so quickly because it was right after lunch time and it was just me. The waitress was very pushy to get me to order and I found out she didn&#39;t even give me a whole menu because she gave a complete menu to the older Japanese couple next to me (mine didn&#39;t even have a cover and was tattered). She asked me 3 times what I wanted to order and then u didn&#39;t hear from her again until she gave me my check. 

I was talking to the guy next to me and we didn&#39;t know if it were due to the meat sweats or the fact that we were literally right next to the kitchen (over the counter) that made it so hot while eating. Made the experience almost uncomfortable. 

Food was comprable in price to what I&#39;ve experienced at similar locations. It was decent tasting food  although it did come a bit salty. 

Tbh, I wouldn&#39;t mind eating here again if I were in the area, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat here."

So one cold night in  January, my husband and I dropped the baby off at my parents&#39; and off we drove to Mt Prospect to see what the fuss was all about.  I was prepared to wait but I did not expect the wait to be in a cold (no heat), cramped, fluorescent-lit hall with folding chairs.  (At least there were chairs). The wait was around 45 min which normally I would skip and go someplace else, but since we made the trip to Mt. Prospect, we stuck it out.  When we finally got seated, we were attended to quickly but waited awhile for our ramen bowls.  I ordered the Kome Miso spicy ramen with an egg.  It was pretty spicy and real salty which I&#39;m not a fan of but I read that the high sodium in ramen isn&#39;t bad for you. I slurped mine within minutes since I was so hungry.  
The restaurant is small which explains the long wait.  They may want to consider expanding the space to accommodate more people.  Overall, the ramen is good, but expect to wait up to an hour if you go on a weekend night."

And a tip, the first time I came here, I ordered the Hokkaido style, not really knowing what&#39;s the difference...but apparently that&#39;s the saltiest. I still gave them another shot and tried again. Second time around I ordered, Nagoya Style and BF ordered Kyoto Style, although not as salty, still leaves you feeling like you need water.

I was pretty impressed with my lunch. I ordered a vegetarian ramen. The potatoes on top of my ramen were amazing. I could have just ate a bowl of that and I would have been perfectly happy. The portions here are very generous. Way better than going to Mitsuwa, it puts them to shame.

I guarantee that when I am in the mood for some ramen I will definitely be trekking to Ramen Misoya as opposed to any other joint for some of that delicious diaretics  (I&#39;m not being gross, guys, ramen really is awesome for you to eat when you are not feeling so great if ya know what I mean).  

Speaking of, Ramen Misoya had many signs posted around the restaurant, informing people of the several benefits to eating ramen.  Although a benefit is that ramen cleanses you, just remember &#34;cleansing&#34; means you&#39;re gonna be lettin&#39; some rip...so make sure you&#39;re not in a confined space.  

Aside from the practical benefits of ramen it&#39;s also just damn delicious!  I don&#39;t think that it particularly matters which kind of ramen you order, especially since all of the three variations of ramen are similar and equally good.  For me, I honestly couldn&#39;t identify the major difference between the three types of ramen that could be ordered but I promise you will be satisfied with whatever you order. Apparently the primary difference is the way the ramen is prepared - I&#39;m still clueless as to how this preparation differs from one to the other but just ask someone who works there.  

Now I feel bad but I can&#39;t remember the actual variation of ramen I got, but I do know that I got shrimp instead of the famous pork in my ramen.  I will admit that in person the pork looks good, but seeing as how I didn&#39;t get the pork in my ramen I can only talk about the shrimp which was amazing.  I&#39;m a shrimp fanatic and will most likely enjoy it in any meal, but it&#39;s quite tastey when mixed with the ramen.  I loved this ramen, though, because there was so much to enjoy in just one bowl...it took me forever and a day to eat, or rather slurp.  The flavors all mixed together was amazing and the ramen was perfectly salty...and hot! 

Also, we got the octopus appetizers which was amazing!  They were rubbery with a perfect twist of crunchiness - so perfect!  The appetizers and two large bowls of ramen was only about $35 which is quite good considering the enormity of the bowl itself!  You get a great deal for the amount and quality of food  you&#39;re getting.   

The only complaint that I may have is that there is very limited seating and the space is quite small.  I believe that this place has grown in popularity which is why the space is too small for all of it&#39;s frequent flyers.  and this place truly does have frequent flyers -  a testament to how good and reliable Ramen Misoya is."

The ramen noodle had a nice texture and bounce. The grilled pork topping was flavorful. The egg was perfectly cooked. Rest of the toppings including corn, bamboo, bean sprouts, seaweed, etc. were pretty much standard. The problem was the broth. Kome was SO SALTY that the complexity of the miso was lost. The rest of the ingredients simply tried to dampen the blow without success. Salt was simply mistaken for flavor. Shiro was a little less salty and taste did shine through. Best of the three was the Tonkotsu. Still salty, but not enough to totally hide the complex mix of pork fat and miso. Unfortunately, I did not try the Mame. This ramen shop is definitely worth a try. I wanted to love it, but the extreme saltiness downgraded what could have been an awesome bowl of ramen."

Cha Shu Ramen: What I really enjoyed the most was the noodle. Not sure if it&#39;s house made or not but it&#39;s great! This ramen came with a lot of things inside of it. Compared to other ramens I had, their portions of meat is greater which it better. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to enjoy the broth like I was hoping too. My taste buds are sensitive to salt and I felt that they broth was too salty to my tasting.

Ramen in it&#39;s nature is salty so be sure to drink a lot of water, and the waitress/ waiters are quick to attend to you. The place is very small as well so I don&#39;t recommend for groups and you most likely will have to sit bar side.

I came years ago and didn&#39;t care for it the first time. I&#39;ve had a few more bowls of ramen since then, so thought I&#39;d give it another go. Definitely better this time now that I know what I like and what to order.  

We ordered the chicken karaage (fried chicken app) and the fried shrimp app. I loved the shrimp but the chicken was plain. It was better with sauce but I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again. 

I forgot what ramen I ordered the first time I came, I think it may have been the Hokkaido style, but now I know that I love tonkotsu broth so I got that this time.

I lived in Japan for three years and my favorite restaurant was a Hokkaido-style ramen shop not far from my house. The kome ramen here at Misoya has theirs beat, and that&#39;s no easy feat. I&#39;ve never had anything like the chashu here -- they grill it and it comes out with nicely browned grill marks that impart an extra level of deliciousness to what&#39;s already a scrumptious, melt-in-your mouth meat. As an extra touch, they also add a wedge of fried potato to the top. Don&#39;t forget to add the miso eggs -- perfection!

Now for some cons: as others have said, there&#39;s frequently a wait here. Our party of four arrived just after noon on a weekday and we ended up waiting nearly an hour. Part of this was due to a clerical error on the part of the hostess. You have to write your name and number in your group in a book at the entrance. Somehow, she skipped us and seated a party of four that came in about 30 minutes after us. When my wife asked, she acknowledged the error and gave a hurried apology, but made no concessions for us. As others have noted, this place is small, with counter space for individuals, but only a few tables that seat larger groups. So we had to wait our turn. This would have been enough to turn me off from coming again, but the quality of the food did a lot to make up for it.

Another issue is the parking: they don&#39;t have enough and many of the spots are reserved for the other stores in the small strip mall. I think the key is to come here during off-peak hours if you want a chance at getting a spot and getting seated in a reasonable amount of time.

Some folks think the ramen here is too salty, but I tend to prefer my ramen on the salty side, so no complaints here. My wife and daughter were in the &#34;too salty&#34; camp. If you want a less salty broth, order the Kyoto-style shiro miso. You can also request extra broth to make it slightly thinner and less salty.

I&#39;ll definitely be coming back here... hopefully when it&#39;s less crowded."

My one piece of advice: do not come here if you are starving, like I was. We waited a long, long time in the small waiting room before we were called into the dining room. I was really hungry when we walked in the door, which was a huge mistake. I was told there is always a wait here, and usually quite a long one. We arrived around 11:30 on a Saturday and waited a good 45 minutes or so, to give you an idea.

Aside from the long wait (which is the sole reason that I knocked off a star), the food was just fantastic. We went on an especially cold day and the ramen warmed me to my core. It was the perfect blend of salty, spicy, and savory. I couldn&#39;t eat the whole bowl, but I wanted to. I know I don&#39;t have any other basis of comparison for ramen, but I just can&#39;t imagine eating better ramen that I had that day. Not possible.

I hate long waits, but I know that I would gladly head back to Ramen Misoya and wait just as long or longer for more of this ramen. It&#39;s just that good."

Ramen Misoya specializes in three types of miso-based broths with various toppings.  The Nagoya is medium brown in color and opaque.  I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s salty but maybe has a hint of sweetness?  The flavor was definitely different than I&#39;m used to.  I also didn&#39;t enjoy their grilled pork as much.  It&#39;s leaner and although pretty tender, I much prefer fattier pork belly cuts that melt in your mouth.  Also, the ramen noodles were on the thicker side, kind of soft, and curly, like they came fried in a package, and then dunked in the broth to rehydrate.  I&#39;m suspicious of whether their noodles are good quality.  They have some &#34;seasonal&#34; ramens like curry and tonkotsu (pork based broth).  My fave kind of ramen remains the tonkotsu broths at Santouka/Mitsuwa and Wasabi and the chicken paitan at Ramen Takeya.

Their appetizers were all good, though.  Takoyaki (6 octopus/potato balls), 3 grilled whole squids, and chicken karaage (fried chicken pieces).

Surprisingly, the wait at 1:30 PM on a Saturday was an hour, so we didn&#39;t get seated until 2:30, and by the time we finished our meal at 3:30, there was still a line of people waiting to eat!  Also, there are only 4-ish tables that can seat 4-5 people.  The rest of the seating is along the counter, so don&#39;t come with an entourage or wait for a very off-time (weekday?) to go.

Lastly, the parking lot kind of sucks.  Certain spots are &#34;reserved&#34; (via hand written poster board signs) for the dry cleaner and convenience store."

I finally did last week, and it was worth the drive. I got something like a tan-tan chasu ramen (?? I can&#39;t remember the name), for $9.90 and it was pretty good! Broth was savory and noodles are on the thicker/cheweir side (as other reviews had mentioned), but I didn&#39;t mind it. I generally like thinner noodles, but these were like excessively thick.

Service was super nice. The venue is small, maybe like 15 tables plus bar-like seating at the open kitchen area. There is a waiting area right outside.

I would recommend! And I would come back."

I&#39;ve been to other delicious  ramen places before but this definitely beats them. I got the Hokkaido style cha-shu ramen. I added the miso egg into it. I&#39;ve never had corn in my ramen before and it was awesome, it added a little sweetness to the ramen. The waitress told us what the styles meant. She said Hokkaido style is salty, Kyoto style was less salty, and the Nagoya style was bitter. The Hokkaido was salty but not overpowering. The meat was thick and not like a melt in your mouth meat but it was great. I love the char flavor it added to the soup. This was so delicious and I will definitely be coming back."

I am glad that I didn&#39;t order an appetizer because the toppings and noodles made me really full, I couldn&#39;t even finish it.

Misoya is a cozy little place with very nice staff. 

As for the ramen, my boyfriend loved it. He said it was flavorful, not too rich, and the spiciness wasn&#39;t over the top. But the reason why this is a 3 is because although it&#39;s good, their ramen just didn&#39;t wow me. I couldn&#39;t finish my bowl because there wasn&#39;t enough balance in the flavor for me. 

Bias comment: As someone who is hypersensitive to salty food, I did find my food too salty. That was prolly what threw off my taste buds.

I really was excited due the plethora of stars. Sometimes i wonder if i should trust them. 

This weekend i decided to go early. After freezing to death at the cubs game, misoya just sounded like heaven but I thought it was ok. The broth was good but a bit salty, the pork was just tasteless and the service of the place was just awful. So the soup warmed me up but not so much to write a 5 star review."

I ordered the Spicy Ramen, with vegetarian broth and chicken pieces instead of pork. Next time I&#39;m going to go all vegetarian. I would have preferred the chicken pieces to be smaller. The four stars is for the flavor and the spicy dish. Loved it. 
We also ordered spicy potatoes in appetizer which was a disappointment. They were just simple potato wedges served with ketchup. We expected &#34;spicy&#34;. 

There are couple of reasons that I took off one star: parking is an issue, eating Ramen made me tired...all the swallowing of noodles!  You just have to bend over the dish, in order to avoid the liquid splattering on your dress."

First thing we noticed was that even though there is a fairly large parking lot in front of Ramen Misoya, nearly half of the spaces are reserved for other businesses in the strip mall, it made parking a bit of a challenge for us, and we didn&#39;t see much in the way of other parking options nearby.

I feel that the menu could be intimidating for first-timers; it is in three sections- 1st you pick your style of ramen noodle (kome, mame or shiro), then go to the page for that noodle and pick a preparation, then pick any add-ons (listed in the back of the menu). There are also pages in the menu for appetizers and beverages; I was disappointed that they only had canned green tea, and I didn&#39;t see an option for hot tea (but I could have missed it). Our server took the time to help us understand the menu even though they were busy- we appreciated that. I tried to find the menu on-line ahead of time to get familiar with it but wasn&#39;t able to find it.

Although &#34;vegetarian menu available&#34; is printed on the menu, it simply means that they can prepare the miso without pork on request. Ask your server about this if you&#39;re interested.

If you are seated at the bar/counter, you can entertain yourself by reading about the health benefits of miso. I believe that there is a photo of the health benefits of miso card that someone else posted here on Yelp.

Other reviews mentioned that their miso broth was overly salty- I seldom add salt to my meals and I thought it was not too salty for my taste. I did order the vegetarian broth so that might be the difference?

I tried the hachi seasoning (Japanese pepper) on a small part of my meal and really didn&#39;t feel that it changed the flavor a lot. Probably was due to my &#34;round eye&#34; taste buds?

The portions are quite large but the servers are more than happy to package any leftovers for you to take home.

When a customer is leaving, the cooks in the kitchen seem to say something to the people that are leaving in Japanese- I never did figure out what this was all about or what they were saying. (Added note: an Asian former co-worker told me that they were likely saying &#34;Thank you and Good Bye&#34;)

We had a great experience and look forward to visiting again."

At first I had no idea what I was reading... but I asked the kind lady to give me a soup that she would recommend and ended up getting a spicy Shiro bowl with an egg. I also got fried squid. I received my squid and it was lightly breaded and not too salty, I actually had to squeeze lemon on it. I got my bowl of ramen, and was astonished by the size! This bowl is huge and hot! It was so flavorful and delightful. I ended up getting full around half the bowl, a little less, which is a surprise because I am a pretty big guy.

This was a Zagat-rated place so was expecting an experience deserving of a Zagat rating. I called before coming to inquire about group reservation. I was told they don&#39;t take reservations but assured me that they could accommodate our large group (12 people) if we come within the next 15-20 minutes. We arrived within 15 minutes and introduced myself as the one who called earlier about our large group. The person who greeted us, who was our eventual server replied with a condescending attitude saying, &#34;you&#39;re call doesn&#39;t mean anything!&#34; That gave a sour start to our dinner. We were seated shortly and our orders taken. We didn&#39;t know anything about the kinds of soup served so we asked. Our server hastily answered and kept pointing us to the menu like we should have read the menu descriptions in the first place. She got our orders and we waited and waited and waited - for a long time - for our food to come. Many customers came in after us and table after table, their orders came before us and we were still left wanting and waiting. We finally asked our server what took so long for our food to come. To our dismay, the server immediately threw the cooks under the bus, saying she has nothing to do with the delay and that all she does is put the orders in, while making faces as if it&#39;s our fault for being impatient to wait. Customers who came after us left way long before us. This is utterly unacceptable! We contemplated of not leaving a tip but we still did only because the food was good. The service sucked and maybe it was because of that one girl! This establishment should train their personnel better.

A couple of friends and I have joined together to create a group called &#34;the dinner club.&#34; In said group, we try out places we haven&#39;t been or we go out to eat something we&#39;re all craving - luckily, Misoya was both. We made the trip out to Mt. Prospect because we heard Misoya was some top quality ramen.

When we entered, we were seated right away. It wasn&#39;t super busy; there must&#39;ve been three other people there other than us. We were given menus right away and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I just had a soda. I like salt ramen, and the lady was very kind in answering some of my questions. She directed me to hokkaido style ramen which was spot on for my taste. I ordered the cha-shu ramen, (kome) hokkaido style w/ egg. The broth was full bodied, but not too salty. It had corn and potatoes, but the pork is what I want to talk about. The pork in the ramen was delicious! I even saved a piece of pork for last because it was so flavorful. It&#39;s nice and tender but not too chewy. 

The only thing is that this ramen is a little bit pricier than what I&#39;m used to. It is a generous bowl of ramen, but still, $13 is a little much for one bowl. Although I won&#39;t be a frequent goer, I do recommend this place! GET THE PORK!"

How often can you make such a statement when ranking a restaurant in the burbs? Almost never.

Rather than add a redundant review of their ramen offerings I&#39;d prefer giving context to greatness by saying this ramen spot isn&#39;t highly rated by suburban standards, it really is this good.

4.5 stars only because I couldn&#39;t tell if I got extra noodles and a fully side dish menu would make perfection. More room as opposed to being in a small unit within a tiny strip mall would be nice but at least it isn&#39;t in a hipster village or buried in downtown."

If you&#39;re feeling risky like my lunch date, there are other parking lots available nearby. I just wouldn&#39;t stick around too long or you might snag a ticket. Regardless, this ramen is worth the hunt for a spot - just wanted to forewarn you.

There will be a wait. At least there was the Friday at 12 pm when I was there last. Nicole W and I waited about 15 minutes before we were seated. The service was quick though and our food came out fast so that helped.

This time around I ordered the spicy ramen. When I asked just HOW spicy it was, the waitress said it&#39;s not too bad. She said she doesn&#39;t ever get any complaints from people sayings it&#39;s super spicy. Sounded legit to me, so onward I ordered.

She was right! HOWEVER, I maybe should have gotten further instructions to be sure to mix my bowl so avoid overheating in a single bite. Not sure what ingredient was the &#34;spicy&#34;, but at one point I put a whole spoonful of it in my mouth and almost choked on the heat. Am I a wuss? Maybe. Did I keep eating it? Well of course. But in all seriousness, it wasn&#39;t that spicy and super delicious! I would just suggest mixing up your ramen a bit. 

Luckily I ordered their iced green tea to wash down my yummy spicy ramen. The tea was super refreshing (green tea has kinda been my jam lately).

Anywho - still a 5 start joint in my eyes. Can&#39;t wait to come back :)"

Even the location on Ohio has nothing on Mt. Prospect. You will have to wait to be seated no matter which you choose, but it will end up being one of the smartest decisions you&#39;ve ever made. I recommend the hokkaido but they&#39;re all incredible."

As part of my #ramentrail2015 quest, it definitely is a contender for first place.

We tried the chicken karaage with the lemony mayo sauce first and that was perfectly fried and tender. For our ramens we tried the Kyoto style and the popular Hokkaido. 

Kyoto Style with Cha Shu Pork:
I was going to get the Hokkaido but the server said this was lighter and slightly sweeter than the Hokkaido. She was RIGHT, and I absolutely loved this ramen. It was still creamy and rich and not as smokey as the Hokkaido. The noodles were also the perfect al dente texture. I only wished it came with corn and I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the fried tofu since it got soggy. This is a perfect bowl of ramen folks. 

The grilled pork belly in the ramens:
I wish I could marry it. 

PRO TIP: 
If you have extra soup left, get a side order of noodles for $1.25 and package that baby home for another meal 

Parking situation:
Really stupid, you just have to be patient (I was not) and wait until someone leaves in the world&#39;s tiniest parking lot. But put your name on the waiting list by the door first! 

Overall, Ramen Misoya delivers an extremely solid, well rounded bowl of of ramen. I&#39;m sad it isn&#39;t close to the city, but will definitely make the trek again!"

My hunny was craving some ramen &amp; we decided to drive the 30 minutes here. I ordered the Kyoto style chasu ramen &amp; he order the Hokkaido style chasu ramen. We both added the miso eggs with ours, which are the bomb.com! Our bowls were big &amp; had an assortment of fixings already added to it! The bowls are quite pricey but the ramen is delicious. 

We also order takoyaki as an appetizer it was okay, quite fishy tasting, which makes sense because of the pile of bonito flakes &amp; the chunk of octopus pieces inside. I wasn&#39;t too keen on it but I&#39;m sure other people would like it more than me. Although, I thought it was unusual to receive our appetizer half way through our meal but I get the takoyaki needs time to cook. 

But come here for quality service &amp; food! Just a heads up, the restaurant is quite small &amp; does get packed at times! Parking lot is small too!"

It was very good and I would have it again.  The different in my opinion from some of the other versions I have tried is more vegetables and 3 huge pieces of grill marked chasu.

But what makes it really stand out now is the remodeling which gives it a feel more like the trendy fast-casual restaurants but with fast food prices. This will probably become the norm in the next few years as consumers look for great values that they can bring friends and family too -- especially since more expensive sit-down full-service restaurants don&#39;t cook burgers, fries, or gyros better than fast food specialists do.

What makes Dengeos really stand out for me is how they salt their food less than restaurants that serve similar food do and don&#39;t seem to use as much oil. This is not to say that their food is flavorless, but they don&#39;t overseason items and the textures of their food are good (fried foods are crispy, vegetables are juicy, meat is not overcooked, etc.). My favorites are the gyros and skirt steak sandwich if you&#39;re looking for something simple and delicious."

I spend one night A week in Buffalo Grove and this is always my headlight. The hummus is fresh and the perfect blend of spices  and chickpeas.  Served with fresh warm pita game over. Well the hummus by it self alone I could have like this for dinner!

I&#39;ve had a few things for dinner here from my hamburger, chicken Greco style, and of course the famous gyro plate. The dinner plate you could really get two meals out of there is that much meat with it. Always fresh always and full or flavor it&#39;s like eating a fine steak at a portion of the price. A tomato and a huge portion of onions. The tiZieke sauce is great and always ask for extra and they never charge you. If anything the fact they  don&#39;t charge me for the extra to Zieke sauce is just shows great customer service.

The value and the amount that you get do not compare anywhere else."

The menu here is quite expansive. You place your order, get a number and when it is ready, they call out for you. Drinks are self service.
We ordered an Italian Beef sandwich, Tilappia sandwich, and a Greek salad.
We staked out a booth and waited for our number to be called.
Upon getting our food and digging in, we agreed that none of it was very special. The Italian Beef was kind of blah. I also did not like that they cut the sandwich in half and was sparse on the giardinera.
Tilappia fish sandwich was also kind of bland. The Greek salad was just that, however the dressing that accompanied it was not the best. 
The flavor of everything seemed under seasoned. It was not terrible or anything, just flat.
Lunch was also not cheap for this kind of restaurant. I can only give it about 2.5 stars but I always like to round it up. Others may like it more than me

Cheers to all"

They have great desserts and you can get them to go which is even better. They do get busy but there is ample seating. If you are coming for lunch, I recommend coming here early (11:30) to avoid the rush. You order your food and then seat yourself (similar to portillos)

If gyros are not your thing, they have many other options from Italian beef to grilled cheese. They have salad and other Greek food. Everyone in your party could find something to eat."

One evening I was craving a chicken gyros and since I live directly across the street the place is easy access for me to get to.

When I placed my order there wasn&#39;t a long wait and I requested Tzatiki sauce a few of them at that. I wasn&#39;t charged extra for the sauce and I was given a few. I also love the fact that they keep lemons out in their beverage area. I love putting lots of lemon on my chicken gyros and pita so instead of driving the people who work there crazy with requesting that as well I&#39;m able to take as many lemon wedges as I&#39;d like. AWESOME!

I ordered my food to go and when I arrived home everything was warm, flavorful and fresh! I also added a side order of their delicious Greek potatoes where I squeezed additional lemon juice on. This lemon addict feels you can never have enough lemon especially in yummy delicious Greek food like this! I&#39;ve been dining at Dengeo&#39;s for many years so this review was long overdue!

There are plenty of tables in the dining room so it&#39;s nice to come here for lunch even at noon when it can get crowded. It&#39;s similar to Portillo&#39;s where you order food at the counter, pick up your food when your number is called, and then someone comes around and picks up your tray at your table when you&#39;re done.

The two girls went back and forth about their favorite dishes and how fun it is to work here. NOTHING gets my vote more than enthusiastic people at the job their are at. 

We settled on the meatball sandwich and the gyros plate with greek potatoes. It was all very good. Everything tasted fresh, was delicious, and was plenty of food. We had fun sitting out on the patio and loved people watching. It was fun to see all the families coming to the restaurant after baseball, soccer, and dance practice.

Ordered Italian beef, ask what can I have for the side dish, he offered some, I ask what is Greek stile potato, he sed it&#39;s wedges of potato baked in the oven. For me it&#39;s sounds good, in front of my eyes something like in KFC. And for drink I ordered  small soda. So after some minutes he called my number and I took my tray. I was disappointed. About beef sandwich it&#39;s ok, size is ok, taste is ok for Greek restaurant, but potato, my my , so or they lie or they don&#39;t know what they talking about. I had in front of me boiled potatoes in some liquid ( I think it&#39;s just lemon juice with something) no taste at all, and the they put it in oven for 2 min so u can see some born on top. I worked I Italian restaurant before, and baked them avery day. Baked potato crispy on avery side , spatially on the bottom, because of an oil, or marks from the racks . no nothing. So i had for $2.25 boiled middle size potato in some lemon juice and baked for 2 min. 
Plus I ordered small soda , in receipt I checked it&#39;s middle soda for $1.99.
If u don&#39;t have small soda  just say it , maybe I will take some think ales, a don&#39;t want to  pay $1.99 for small soda( because I will not drink much) plus they bring ice from ice machine and put to soda machine.

I believe I&#39;ve had take-out from them in the past, but to be honest, couldn&#39;t remember.  After having dinner last night, I think I know why.  It&#39;s just not memorable.

I ordered carry-out because my man is sick and we were just stopping in on the way to pick up his prescription.  I ordered:

Dengeos steak sandwich (comes with grilled onions and bbq sauce) also comes with fries.
Gyros plate, which comes with fries, and all the fixins.

I did order the fries well done, as I know any fries tend to get soggy when being transported.  They did a great job with that.

The gyros was just kinda, there.  Kostas at Dundee and Hicks is much more flavorful, and not as soft... the meat has more of a bite, which I like.  The tzatziki was very acidic but not extremely flavorful.  The tomatoes the are currently serving were a bit pale... but the only thing they can really do to avoid that is to say that they&#39;re not serving tomatoes at all, which I doubt would fly.

The thing that really pissed me off was that I was waiting in line behind two high-school aged girls, to order.  There are three registers to order at.  If you&#39;re not familiar with Dengeos, you order at the counter, and then your number is called when your food is ready.  So, i was waiting in line behind these two girls.  It was OBVIOUS we were in line.  Then, these two older people walk in the door, bypass right past us, straight up to the counter and order (the register they went to had JUST become available.)  I mentioned it to the girl at the counter when I got up there, and she just shrugged.  Sure, if they were THAT hungry that they needed to go ahead of me, fine, but that&#39;s not good customer service, Dengeos.

Overall, I wasn&#39;t too impressed and will probably continue to go to Kosta&#39;s for my Gyros fix instead."

My family eats here almost on a weekly basis. They have so many options, and all of them are good quality. My favorite is the BBQ chicken dinner, and the Dengeos chicken salad. I can make 2 meals out of both of these entrees, which is a plus. Most importantly, their cheese fries are AMAZING. I have also had them cater a few parties, and the food is always a big hit!

The chicken pita sandwich is usually my go to but pretty basic/plain tasting.

I want to give this place a better review because food that is actually prepared looks great.

 That was not my experience, I ordered the chicken fingers plate with fries and what I got was frankly insulting. 

The entire meal was what your lowest expectations would be from a dorm cafeteria. It&#39;s almost as if the fries and chicken was microwaved.

Upon coming in, it looked nice and spacious and clean, which is always a plus. You order what you want up front and then they give you a receipt with a number and then you go and pick a table and wait for your number to be called. 

It literally took about five minutes and all our orders were ready. I wasn&#39;t super hungry to get a whole gyro plate so I decided to get the gyro sandwich with extra tziki sauce and it came to about $6.50 and even for the pita sandwich you get a LOT of meat so the portions for the prices are definitely fair. Okay, so the gyros were very yummy but they weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve ever had and since this isn&#39;t just a fast food joint, even though it does carry lots of fast food items I was hoping that the emphasis on delicious gyros would prevail. They were okay, not the best I&#39;ve ever had but certainly not the worst. Now, the tziki sauce which makes the gyros was a little thicker than I prefer as I like it to be more of a dressing instead of a white gob. You get veggies with it like tomatoes and onions which I get on the side. The pita was also good but not the best I&#39;ve had. I usually want to go get a second pita, but not here.

Overall, we had a nice time. The place is spacious, there&#39;s plenty of booths and regular tables, the food consensus amongst all of us is that everything tasted okay but nothing special, however, I don&#39;t think I would go out of my way to come here just for the gyros even though the place is Greek and known for them."

We didn&#39;t know what to expect from the outside, it looked very nice so I expected a sit-down restaurant. It was actually very similar to Kosta&#39;s on Dundee and Hicks, except a little nicer and definitely more crowded! Their menu is large and covers all the traditional Greek bases, with some American classics. 

I ordered the chicken kabob plate with Greek potatoes and pita bread. My boyfriend ordered the salmon dinner (comes with rice and vegetables) and pita bread. Since it was so busy, I expected our food to take a long time, but they called our number in about ten minutes. The servings are very large, so you are getting your money&#39;s worth! My chicken was perfectly seasoned and the potatoes were incredible. Their tzatziki was really good! Very different from most other places, it was a little thicker and slightly more savory. The pita was cut into quarters, and I usually like a whole pita with my chicken, so I will have to ask for a whole one next time. But obviously, that did not detract from the food! My boyfriend really liked his salmon and rice (no veggies for him!), and I thought the salmon was great as well! I was pleasantly surprised by the food at this restaurant and I hope to go back soon!

The Super Bowl party that I attended this year had catering from Dengeos and it was super delicious!! They had gyros, chicken, a couple of salads and excellent rice. It was so good that my fiancé and I decided to come back here again and grab some food on a weekend evening. I had the Greek Salad with gyro meat and it was amazing especial with the warm pita bread. My guy had the 1/2 Grecian Chicken with Greek potatoes and he also enjoyed his meal very much. 

I am honestly surprised with all the negative reviews. Dengeos is constantly busy... the restaurant is always packed and the parking lot looks even worse. We walked in on a busy night and ordered for carryout, and we only waited 10 minutes or so. If you are in a hurry, I do recommend calling your food in ahead of time, otherwise, it&#39;s really not that bad of a wait.

It&#39;s a gyro/hot dog/burger joint that is very similar to Portillo&#39;s and other locally-owned Greek/hot dog joints. Although I don&#39;t eat these things anymore, I still love going to the restaurants.

Dengeos doesn&#39;t really have vegan options (aside from a salad and some sides) so I asked for a pita with grilled vegetables in it. The only vegetables they have are onions and peppers, so I said that was OK. I also requested some tomatoes and lettuce on top of it. I explained to the cashier that I don&#39;t eat meat, blah blah blah. After I placed my order, I realized the price was a bit high. I checked the receipt and noticed the girl charged me for a chicken pita. Baffled, I asked the guy behind the counter why I was paying so much for a simple pita with some vegetables in it (&#34;Why should I pay for the price of the chicken if I&#39;m not getting chicken in it?&#34;).

Apparently the girl thought I wanted a chicken pita and had asked for extra vegetables on top of it. And this is after I explained that I don&#39;t eat meat and made a big deal about wanting on vegetables. Really?! How can you mess that up? (And why do places keep messing up my order these days? Is it my fault?) Fortunately, the guy was willing to refund me for the extra cost and switched my order around. Yay!

The pita with vegetables? Delicious! They stuffed it with a good amount of vegetables and the crinkle french fries I got on the side were as good as any other place. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was that my vegetables were not cooked at all, as I had requested, but I was tired of being picky so I ate it anyway. I felt satisfied.

My friend and I ended up staying there nearly two hours, just catching up on life. When we arrived, there was barely anyone dining, but by the time we left (6pm on a Monday night), the place was getting busy. That&#39;s a good sign that this is a good place to go."

I ordered the Italian Beef and a baked potato with BUTTER and a side of au jus for pick up. I got to the restaurant and went to the counter. The gentleman asked for my name, and gave me my total, and I asked if I could add a slice of chocolate cake. He said no problem. I paid, and he brought my order up to the counter. I asked him if the BUTTER was inside. He searched through the bag and said, yes.

I got everything home, and it&#39;s still hot (I live about five/ten minutes away). I opened everything up and the sandwich is huge and stuffed to the brim with beef. Very tasty, but the au jus is way too oily/greasy. It really should be more of the beef drippings, not the fat and oil, so half a star off for that. The potato is good, but very small for the price they charge. I would expect a bigger potato. Not huge, mind, but more a medium sized, and what they give you is a small, so another half star off for that.

Now, to the BUTTER. Notice that every time I write the word, BUTTER, I capitalize all letters. This is because I asked for BUTTER, not MARGERINE!!! So, I am not happy that when I asked for BUTTER, and even checked at the counter to ensure the BUTTER is in the bag, and I get home and see MARGERINE, I am not happy! If I&#39;d wanted MARGERINE, I&#39;d have specifically asked for that, but I asked for BUTTER. Country Crock is NOT BUTTER. There is no substitute for BUTTER!!!!!!!!! So, one full star off for that.

Still, as I said, Dengeos is otherwise a good place, and I&#39;ll go back for another Italian Beef, and to try other items on the menu.

And I know some people will read this and get to the butter part, and laugh, and I get it, but sorry, it&#39;s not funny to me. Also, I can&#39;t say anything about the cake yet, because I&#39;m still eating the dinner part. I&#39;m going to assume it&#39;s good. It certainly looks good, and while a small piece, it cost less than $3 while at other places for the same sized piece, they&#39;d charge $4 or $5, I&#39;m not complaining about that."

He enjoys the gyro plate, 8 bucks can get you gyro and fries. The meat is juicy and tender and their tzatziki sauce is fabulous. His other favorite is the half bbq chicken, 8 bucks can get you the chicken, a potato of your choice, coleslaw, and garlic bread. Everything that we have had here is delicious and we have not had any complaints about their food. 

The place is very clean, the service is great (they take away your trays if you&#39;re done and still chatting away), and there is plenty of seating. But even with the seating, this place gets jam packed on a Friday/Saturday night and sometimes you can&#39;t find seating very easily."

This is one of the places I would go out of my way a little for when we lived in Palatine.  I almost went with 5 stars just to offset the 3 star reviews.  The Philly Chicken is freaking awesome and all of the food we&#39;ve had here is really good.  Cheeseburger - Good, Chicken Cesear Salad - Solid, Skirt Steak Sandwich - Delicious.  They give you some warm pita or garlic bread with your salads and I am always greeted with a friendly welcome when we come in.  The cashiers are always ready to take our order and we never have to wait that long for our food.  

As a place that brings us Vienna beef, Kronos gyros and Gonnella bread I can&#39;t imagine why they aren&#39;t getting more love.  Maybe it&#39;s because we are all so used to the hole-in-the-walls around town, but they really are offering up the same exact food in a nicer overall location.  It is always busy at rush times and we&#39;re always treated nicely.  Great place for a family dinner.  You can stay for 15 minutes or stay for a couple hours, never hassled and always a nice time when we&#39;re there.  I can highly recommend Dengeos to anyone because they have FREAKING EVERYTHING!!!  Enjoy the deliciousness that my family and I so often do."

It&#39;s all about that double bacon cheeseburger. I would advise against going with their meal that comes with fries and coleslaw.

Their coleslaw sucks, there&#39;s no sugar coating it. Every time I&#39;ve gotten it it&#39;s room temperature. Cabbage is limp. Juuuust shy of flavorless, and the bit of flavor that you do get is like a watery Miracle Whip. Not for me, I guess, and I love me some coleslaw.

I&#39;ve also substituted the fries that come with the meal for Greek potatoes twice in the past. Eh, I prefer the fries.

The potatoes are okay, I feel like if they toned down the butter a tad(kindouv a lot), and threw some more lemon flavor in there they&#39;d be fantastic. Until then I&#39;ll leave them with a solid &#34;Meh&#34;.

Onto the burger, ohhh man. Any burger you get, get it with bacon. The bacon is thick cut and always crispy. Flavorful as hell. &#34;Everything&#34; is lettuce, dill pickles, tomatoes, onions, ketchup, mustard, and mayo. Good portion, really gotta open the mouth to get a solid bite. Have napkins handy, it&#39;s a messy beast.

Been eating here 2-3 times a month for the past two years or so, and as it&#39;s so close to work I have no intentions of stopping."

I ordered the greek salad and the HUGE disappointment was finding a long black hair in my food.  Thank goodness I didn&#39;t eat any of it yet as the long black hair was right on top of the feta cheese.  I took it back immediately and the cashier was apologetic and it seemed it was the manager that demanded I be given a new one.  I thoroughly inspected the new one and enjoyed it. While I appreciated their promptness regarding getting me a new salad -- we won&#39;t be back.  Perhaps the girl at the counter whose job it is to double check the food before it goes out could spend less time on her iphone and more time doing her job.

It&#39;s a great place to get a pizza puff if you want a fix. My personal favorite is the pork kabob sandwich, served skewered on a pita. Very lean cuts with a slice of lemon, plenty of raw onions, tomato, a kosher pickle and yogurt sauce.

I personally love the hunan beef and chicken. This spicy and garlicy concoction is making me salivate right now. Fried rice is delicious, and their spicy pork is always a hit. Let&#39;s not forget about the portion sizes.

After reading all the positive reviews I finally decided to give it a shot. Usually I&#39;m not one for Chinese takeout but this place was literally 5 minutes from my house so why not. I ordered:

The egg rolls: Just about every review raved about these things and I can see why. They are like a quarter pound to half a pound per egg roll and are stuffed with Chinese barbequed pork and vegetables. I would say 3 is enough for a full lunch for me. (1.50 each)

The Beef Chow Fun: At around 10 dollars, this seemed a little pricey for Chinese takeout but I admit I was wrong...wanna know why?

 CUS THEY GAVE ME 5 POUNDS OF FOOD!!!!

I&#39;m not joking, the dish weighed literally 4-5 pounds. After 2 giant egg rolls l could only finish like 1/6 of this massive pile of beef, noodles and veges. The flavor was good but nothing special.  The quantity of food is just absurd.

So to sum things up, this place makes great egg rolls and giant dishes of food. If you want to get your money&#39;s worth, give this place a shot, I&#39;m sure your belly will hate you after you stretch it like a water balloon with tasty Chinese takeout."

The Beef and Broccoli is great, but their Sweet&#39;n Sour sauce could use some work.  It&#39;s way too sweet and loaded with pineapples.  The fried rice is full of bean sprouts, which I like, but you may not.  You have been warned.

If the answer is an enthusiastic yes then this place is for you. From what I have seen, this place basically runs and thrives on its many many variations of the breast of chicken. 

Examples:

Chicken Sandwich: fried chicken breast patty. 

Chicken Nugget: clearly cut pieces of chicken breast fried the same as the patty. 

Chicken breast soup: Its in the name.

Grilled Chicken Nuggets: same as fried nuggets but grilled. 

Chicken strips: Made from chicken breasts. 

Tortilla soup: probably made with chicken breast too. 

I&#39;m sure there are more stuff that include the chicken breast on the menu. 

Some of the other stuff on their menu include waffle fries and a unique lemonade. The waffle fries I really have no opinion on, they aren&#39;t amazing nor bad. The lemonade is quite good and tastes fresh if super sugary drinks are your thing. The diet lemonade isn&#39;t as good  because one must imagine how much artificial sweetener they need to dump in to match the sweetness. 

What really stood out about this place are the service and the sauces. The service was really good for a fast food chain. They had a lady going around asking if you want your drinks refilled and the speed they crank orders out is phenomenal. 

The two sauces I tried both surprised me:

The Chick-fil-a sauce: Very similar to honey mustard with more spice added and kinda of reminds me a little bit of horseradish. 

The Polynesian sauce: I imagined it would be generic sweet and sour sauce but again, like the chick fil a sauce, has an added spice kick to it. 

These 2 condiments really stood out for me. Too bad I don&#39;t really like chicken breast that much.  

So again, if you like chicken breast, let this be your new fast food destination. I tried to be objective but personally, breast just ain&#39;t my thing. 

An above average fast food chain."

This place just opened up a few weeks ago and the whole place is spankin&#39; new. Staff were polite and wonderful as always. However, the place is a lot smaller than the east Schaumburg location near Woodfield. The whole interior felt cramped and crowded.

This was my first experience here and I had heard so much about this place and how they had respectable values so I decided to come here with a guy I met on Grinder.  We went through the drive through, and there was no one behind us but they were awfully pushy to get my order, I got the number 2, crispy chicken with American Cheese, and a root beer. (Never heard of american cheese on chicken it intrigued me) We could hear a bunch of woman talking to each other through the head set which made it hard to order.  We then pulled up to the window where the window woman was laughing and laughing and I&#39;m not sure if it was at me or not but I felt like that was very unchristian of her.  I gave my money and left.  When we got home and started watching Golden Girls and opened the food and this crispy chicken was soggy as hell.  My only question is who the hell puts American Cheese on a chicken breast on general it was gross.  The fries were not that great, and my root beer didn&#39;t taste very carbonated.  I was not at all pleased with my food. Not to mention both me and my date got the runs from the food all afternoon.  I literally was making spin art all afternoon in the bathroom. And he went home and had to stop off twice to flush the demons out of him.  This was not at all good. I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t live up to the hype. I was truly hoping for a great meal for the price to bring back to my AA group  but instead I found a new way to cleanse my insides.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be back.

I do have to give my server some props for the friendliest service in town. She brought some water while I was deciding on lunch. I ordered some Thai iced coffee which she brought over to the table fairly quickly. I ordered the spicy beef meal which is a part of their lunch special menu. Mine came with 1 eggroll (you can opt for a vegetarian eggroll), a small cup of vegetarian tom yum soup, and some veggie fried rice (or plain steamed if you wish). The tom yum soup was good and had enough veggies as well as flavors, however, I have to say that the eggroll lacked any sort of flavor. The spicy beef had a good flavor to it but it was fairly tamed when it comes to the spiciness.

The place is clean and well-decorated.  The booths are sizable so if you have 2 people sitting on each side you won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re too close to each other. The restaurant from the inside definitely does not reflect what greets you from the outside. The staff were polite and they provide efficient service. For example, my waitress brought over my bill after she delivered my main dish which I appreciate because I hate having to wait for my bill for a long time after finishing my food.

Overall, I feel like I&#39;ve been to a more authentic Thai place than this. It sort of reminds me of a fusion restaurant. Maybe I just didn&#39;t try the right menu items but as it stands, I think it&#39;s a 3-star at best mostly because of the fantastic service."

Luckily, this one was and it was nearby. 

For appetizers, we ordered the Egg Rolls $4.25 was not bad, the pieces were cut in halves. I liked the glass noodles inside and they had this nice savory, sweet dipping sauce which we cleaned out. The Tom Yum soup was $4.95 but the bowl was a bit small for the price. They did have the option to go with a larger size for more money so perhaps that will have to do next time. Also, I asked for mild spice but I should have gone with Hot because it was a bit too mild. Normally, at other places I haven&#39;t been given a choice for the level of spicy-ness for the soup so I didn&#39;t know what to chose. I chose Chicken as the meat but it&#39;s probably better to go with Shrimp next time just to complete the taste. They have many pieces of Chicken but it doesn&#39;t quite beat the Shrimp. 

As for entrees, the hubby and ordered the Pad See Ew $10.45 which was delicious and we finished it all. The Panang Chicken $10.95, came with a rice bowl and was good as well and tasted mild. I could use a little more spice so may try for a Red Curry dish next time. We bagged up the curry because we were so full. For a dinner for 2, our total came out to be $34 before tip so not a bad dinner date. Overall service was polite and courteous and the bathrooms were clean. We will definitely be back again for more Thai eats."

I asked for medium and it was Midwest medium high spiced, good for me. Egg rolls ok, smaller variety in size, quick to cook, easier to eat."

But this time I was really disappointed with the portion size. I usually come here and can never finish my plate and look forward to left overs! I came with a group of friends this time and they all got the same dish but different meats, and I think they might of given me the last bit of the noodles or something bc all of their plates were still pretty full after mine was already half done and my plate looked pretty empty compared to there&#39;s too before eating.... I didn&#39;t say anything bc it wasn&#39;t worth it but I don&#39;t think il be coming back here again after this experience. I left feeling ripped off, still hungry, and very unsatisfied."

My son and I both thought the noodles were awesome.  My husband loved the curry.  It was good, but a little too spicy for me.  So to summarize, I have never gotten anything from here I did not like.  They have also averaged 10-15 mins for take out, even when they have a counter full of take out orders.  We always get take out, but the people with have that short interaction with are super nice too."

Dining in after so long was definitely not the same and I wish we had just ordered to pick up. In addition to that the owner decided to say she remembered us and claimed we were &#34;the restless group.&#34; This was completely insulting and started the evening off on a bad note. Then the server did a poor job as well. The peanut sauce was not even a sauce, it took forever for the food, checking in to make sure everything was great was nonexistent, and when we needed something it took forever to get the server to come to the table. After today&#39;s experience the chance of us going back is very slim."

I&#39;ve been here numerous times before I had discovered Dan. Each time was a charm. Perhaps I didn&#39;t notice, or perhaps the times are tough in the garden. Everything we ordered tasted watered down.  It was as if they were trying to cut corners in every aspect of their business. The tom yum tasted of dandelions instead of Lemon grass. Loaded with cheap veggies which were difficult to eat and not cooked. The broth was basically water. No flavor. The two main entrees we ordered (1 tofu something and 1 spicy pork) had more nasty fillers than an Oscar Meyer wiener. What I mean by that is they loaded the plate up with a watered down sauce and enough cheap veggies to make a green smoothie. Honestly, I maybe had a handful of pork in my plate. Unacceptable! If I wanted veggies, I&#39;d go to subway. Perhaps that&#39;s all is growing in the Thai Garden lately. Freaking onions and green peppers. No thanks. Never again. See you all at dan Thai.  

P.S. &#34;Spicy&#34; here is equivalent to Taco Bell verde sauce. Not even the mild."

Each restaurant brings a little something different to the table. In this case, I really like the Thai style spicy fried rice at Thai garden. Many of the other entrees on the menu are excellent as well however I generally go to Thai garden for my Thai style fried rice fix. It&#39;s excellent and I usually get it with shrimp. They don&#39;t skimp on the shrimp and they are well cooked. Their sauce is a little sweet a little spicy and just perfect for me. My wife generally gets the pad si yu which is excellent as well. Tom yum soup is delicious. Lunch specials are a great value and service is quick and courteous. The ambiance is actually quite nice for dinner as well."

My friend and I go to a lot of Thai restaurants in the NW SUBURBS. we always order crab rangoons as an appetizer. Theirs had the best &#34;crust&#34; ever! Light, not oily, very crisp and beautifully shaped.

My entree, basil chicken was delicious. Ground chicken, basil, onions, peppers and straw mushrooms. It could have been a tad spicier - next time I&#39;ll say hot not medium hot. 

We rarely get dessert but we got &#34;baby bananas with chocolate sauce&#34; - SO good. Kind of like a banana cannoli! Really delicious.

The server was attentive. The atmosphere was pleasant though not exceptional. 

We split the Bill - it was $23 each (we each had tea as well).

I waited forever for a seat, even though there were plenty of empty spots. The host told me he&#39;d get me a table &amp; then disappeared for a long while. Not sure where he went. I was waiting for people anyway, so I guess it didn&#39;t matter that much.

Our server was nice &amp; friendly. Other than that, the service was super slow. Super slow to the point we all noticed. 

We ordered spicy beef, tofu panang, &amp; combination pad thai. It wasn&#39;t good, it wasn&#39;t bad. I got the combination pad thai (chicken &amp; shrimp) &amp; there were like 4 pieces of shrimp. For the extra charge, I thought there would be more. I ordered the pad thai spicy, but it came out only really sweet. Not sure if that was a mistake on my part for asking it to be spicy? 

Their food was mediocre. There are def better Thai places to go to. Plus, they&#39;re pricey for the portions, but I think most Thai places are like that anyway. 

Whenever I get the urge to eat Thai Garden, I always order tom yum seafood &amp; sometimes the squid salad carry out. The tom yum soup is probably the best thing on their menu. I can&#39;t find any other Thai place that does tom yum soup like they do! I always order it extra extra spicy with extra cilantro. Yes, it burns, but I love it."

Big family with grandparents totaled 8 of us and still very nicely seated with enough room and a big table for all the great food! 

Tom Kha Soup with chicken was such a great call- the chicken and vegetables were AMAZING and FRESH! Honestly the freshest chicken I&#39;ve tasted in any Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very fresh too as well as the beef satay that finished the apps. 

Pad Thai is a must, along with Massuman curry and Panang noodles. But the Basil Mussels caught my eye this time around. Great choice! Good amount of veggies and sauce. Spicy beef along with a seafood dish accompanied the carbs very, very well. Everybody got a huge portion of everything and were already stuffed- before dessert! 

Sticky rice was great!!! And you can have any kind of ice cream flavor on top! So many choices! (that&#39;s rare for Thai places!) we tried green tea and jackfruit and mango.... Along with the Thai custard was delicious. And don&#39;t forget the Thai herbal hot tea to finish off. 

After this whole dinner, the part that really was the cherry on top was talking to the owner Tom. What a great guy. A nice family business with genuine owners that spend their life at work. Nice to see the quality control and very good customer service. He stopped by the table to see how the food was and ended up talking about everything!!

Veggie egg rolls, tom kha soup, fried rice (pineapple or plain old, both are delightful). All my favorites. We used to live within waking distance, and this was our go-to meal. In the weeks after my son was born, it was all I wanted to eat. 

We have since moved out of the area, and we can&#39;t find a replacement for our dear Thai Garden. Waaa. So we go whenever we&#39;re around.

The biggest ding I can think of is that they don&#39;t accept AmEx. Their bubble tea is also nothing to write home about. But neither of these factors dim the shining star that is Thai Garden."

We had the Tom Yum soup, which was a tad spicy, right amount of tanginess and vegetables and it definitely hit the spot. The spring roll was a little over done but not too bad for a strip mall Thai food. 

I had the Penang Chicken with fried rice which was actually one of the better ones I have had. it was right amount of coconut in the curry but there was something missing that didn&#39;t develop into its full flavor, probably lack of salt or some seasoning.

We also had the Spicy chicken which was also pretty good just not as spicy as i thought as well as the gravy was on the sweeter side. 

Overall this is a pretty good place if you want a quick thai lunch for a decent price. The ambiance is good, and is tastefully decorated also area is clean and is more upscale looking than its outer simple appearance. However, the service seems rushed and and might need a little  more work on customer service."

Came here for dinner, ordered the vegetable wantons for appetizer.  Contents were quite good and the crispy wanton shell contrasted nicely with the texture of the filling.  The accompanying sauce was also quite fitting, although a little on the sweet side.  

For meals we tried the staple pad thai in both chicken and tofu varieties.  The chicken and tofu were well cooked, however the noodles for both dishes were slightly overdone.  The sauce was applied a little too liberally and the sweetness of the dish was slightly overpowering.  

I also prefer a more traditional style of separating the ingredients for the pad thai, but here the bean sprouts and peanuts were pre mixed.  The dish was accompanied with fresh lime which was a nice touch, however the limes were nearly dry.

Ambiance was clean and pleasantly a bit on the formal side, with interesting art adorning the walls.  Service was very friendly, almost overly respectful, unfortunately it was not attentive.  We never had water refills and after finishing it took about 10 minutes for the server to notice, despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty.

All in all, not bad.  The food was decent and the staff was nice, but with a plethora of Thai food in the area, this one doesn&#39;t start at the top, but probably warrants another try to see if their more traditional Thai food fits the bill a little better."

We ordered the Panang tofu lunch, spicy tofu lunch, and pad Thai lunch. The lunch specials are $7.75 each and they come with rice, egg roll, and soup..... An AMAZING bargain. They huge a huge quantity of food leaving you thoroughly satisfied at the conclusion of your meal. 

As far as taste..... I was blown away by the spicy tofu lunch special. It was spicy, light, and had a wonderful combination of vegs and flavor. The tofu was well marinated and sautéed perfectly. The Panang curry had a light coconut cream sauce that was also wonderful. 

Overall the service and food were excellent. They constantly checked on us keeping drinks topped off and kept the table clear. On top of that....the food was awesome. Definitely will be back again."

I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t given my review for this establishment, maybe subconsciously I don&#39;t want the whole world to know about how good the food taste here, LOL!
Thai Garden is located within a strip mall so there&#39;s plenty of parking.  I&#39;ve been going here for years and when we try out new Thai places, we compare our dishes with this place.
When you go into the restaurant, it&#39;s a pretty good size.  There are some sections of the place that are divided with half walls.  It&#39;s pretty cozy with booths and tables, even for a big group they are so accommodating and they have a very nice staff.  One time I had my GNO (Girls Night Out) here and they put us chatty gals in the back of the room so it felt like we had our own private room, so nice of them.
The dishes are served like family style, enough to share and have leftovers.  Unless you brought a BIG appetite  It does get busy during the lunch rush hours and weekends, so I usually come here for dinner during the week.  
So here are the dishes we usually order again and again...
We start off with a tall glass of Thai iced coffee or Thai iced tea which both is sweet and creamy.
For appetizers, we order their fresh Spring Rolls which is steamed soft rice paper rolled with rice noodles, fresh cucumbers, basils, cilantro, and bean sprouts. You get 3 pcs with hoisin sauce on the side which includes crush peanuts.  
Sometimes I order a small Tom Yum Chicken soup which is a traditional Thai lemon grass soup (spicy and sour) with chicken, straw mushrooms, and tomatoes. It&#39;s a good alternative of the old fashion Chicken Soup if you&#39;re under the weather.  I highly recommend if you make this as your main meal, ask for a large with noodles (thin noodles like pad Thai) which makes this a spicy chicken noodle soup, good stuff sniff, sniff!  
For our main meals, we order Curry Fried Rice combinations with chicken and shrimp.  It&#39;s one of their chef&#39;s special fried rice with yellow curry sauce, coconut milk, eggs, onions and carrots so good. 

For a noodle dish, I&#39;d order Beef or Chicken/Shrimp Pad Thai.  It&#39;s a platter of delicious thin rice noodles stirred in their homemade sweet and tangy Pad Thai sauce, with eggs, ground peanut, fresh bean sprouts, and green onions.  If I wanted a little bit of heat, I would ask the server to get me some Thai chili sauce which comes in a little container that you can see the red sauce and pepper seeds with a little spoon making my Pad Thai sweet and spicy

My husband&#39;s favorite dish which he can&#39;t find it made like this anywhere!  It&#39;s a traditional Thai yellow curry blended with coconut milk, potatoes and onions with chicken or a combo chicken/shrimp.  It comes with a side of white rice.

Another dish my friend introduced me (I&#39;d order this when I&#39;m in the mood to eat with my hands) is called Larb Kai.  It&#39;s a made with ground chicken breast seasoned with lime juice, onions, Thai herbs and spices.  It&#39;s so good to eat this with an order of Sticky Rice.  With cleaned hands, I would take some sticky rice and roll it into a size of a golf ball and eat some of the Larb Kai the then the sticky rice ball I created, and then repeat.  Of course you can use a spoon and fork but it&#39;s more fun using what God gave you, natural utensils...your hands and fingers, lol!

Overall, if you want good authentic Thai food come here, you won&#39;t be disappointed at this place!"

My favorite dish is the Popeye Tofu. It&#39;s a pretty simple concept--tofu, spinach, and peanut sauce--but their version is AMAZING. The tofu is crispy and flavorful. It&#39;s like it has its own flavor. The spinach is fresh. The peanut sauce, orgasmic. And they give you a LOT of it. In fact, I think this is the only time I ever get enough peanut sauce at a Thai restaurant :). Have to give &#39;em five stars based on this dish alone.

Sometimes I get the Tom Kha soup and the Tofu Pad Thai. Tragically, I can&#39;t recommend the Pad Thai, it just doesn&#39;t measure up--especially compared to the flavor bomb that is the Popeye. It&#39;s a bit tart, a bit savory, a hint of other flavors, but in the end, bland.

The place has a nice quiet ambiance and good service. One time though, they misheard me and initially served me the Pepper Tofu instead of Popeye. So make sure you enunciate :P. I&#39;ve never had the smoothies because Coffee Haus, the place with the best smoothies, is just a few doors down."

The decor is typical of most Thai restaurants I&#39;ve been; we felt comfortable here. The menu is extensive, covering any type of meat or flavor you would want in Thai food. I had such a hard time deciding, nearly choosing to blindly land my finger on any choice. Luckily, I thought it through and ordered the Basil Tofu. I wish I had gotten broccoli to replace the onions and peppers, and I hoped for more sauce to dredge my rice in. However! This was a great dish with fantastic basil-y flavor. I was perfectly pleased to scarf this down. My sister got one of the house specials with salmon (forgot the name), which was really great as well. I would definitely go back here next time I find myself out at Woodfield Mall. I think there&#39;s curry in my future.

My only negative, which is more of a comment than a complaint, is that the portions are smaller than I&#39;m used to at a Thai restaurant, though the prices are the same. This may be because it&#39;s near Chicago and is competitive to the area? Or I&#39;m a spoiled fatty who loves too much food? Doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;m still heading back here. Flavor over price in this case."

I ordered a lunch special that came with soup and egg roll. I chose the Tom-Yum soup and could not eat it because it was so oily the grease was sticking to the side of the cup. The egg roll was your standard out of the box, drop in hot oil and serve. Nothing special about the egg roll.

My entree was Tiger shrimp in a ginger sauce. It was to come with onions, mushrooms and red peppers. I cannot eat peppers and was about to ask if they could substitute a different veggie but I realized before I asked that the menu said no substitutions. I understand the policy and just requested it without the red peppers. Well, I admit I like stir fried onions but not when it becomes the most dominant feature on the plate. Perhaps they were trying to compensate for me requesting no peppers but to load me up with a plateful of onions was not the way to do it. Perhaps maybe a few pieces of broccoli or carrot would have been nice. The garlic sauce, shrimp and rice were good so perhaps I will give this another try in the future."

Ordered the salmon ma hog house special. I asked to have it mild but she said it&#39;s pre made and that it was just little bit spicy so I went with it but it was too spicy for me!!! Plus the salmon was very dry and flaky. I&#39;ve had this dish much better at other Thai places.

Tom yum soup was delicious and generous on the jumbo shrimpies!

Beef salad had waaaaay too much onions. It was 90% raw yellow onions and 10%bf and qcumber n tomato. Otherwise tasted pretty good.

Everyone was just standing around.  We had to ask to order.  It was also sticky hot in here... and I am the type of person who is always cold!

We both got the lunch special which comes with tom yum soup and an egg roll.  The soup was like spicy water with some cabbage thrown in.  Not the Tom yum I love.  The egg roll was a tiny probably from the freezer version.

My dish was pretty good.  I got the Curry chicken with fried rice.  The fried rice was a pretty lame excuse for fried rice if I have ever seen one.  My dining partner did not really enjoy his spicy beef.

When we were leaving, we ordered two Bubble Teas to go.  I started drinking my Honey Dew Bubble Tea in the car and it tasted off.  First of all, they did a crappy job blending it.  It did not taste like Honey Dew.  Then I got to the tapioca balls and they tasted metallic.  I was afraid of getting food poisoning, so I chucked it.

The staff always recognize us when we come in.

I will admit, the service can sometimes be unpredictable here, it has fluctuated through the years. Sometimes it takes a little too long for the food to come out. But in my opinion, I&#39;m able to overlook that from time to time because the food is SO delicious.

Our favorites at Thai Garden include the Tom Kha soup (with or without chicken), Panang Curry, Garlic Chicken, Garlic Tofu, Chicken Satays, Popeye Tofu, Pineapple Fried Rice, and /of course/, the Pad Thai. My mom swears by their Pad Thai, and has never found the dish anywhere else that could compare.

Thai Garden is also great for lunch. Their lunch specials are really reasonable, and come with a lot of food. You get soup and an eggroll in addition to the dish of your choice served with fried or white rice. A very good deal.

The food is at most OK....nothing all that impressive.  However, the food was not really the reason I stopped coming. 

Last fall I was at the restaurant when, ate my food and paid my bill.  I left a decent tip but the waitress did NOT do much at all.  However, at the end of my dinner she comes up to me in front of my friends and she asks me if she did anything wrong that warranted her a small tip.  That was not only unnecessary but also very embarrassing.  I got so angry that I wanted to talk to a manager, but decided instead of doing I&#39;m just gonna walk away, never show up and warn other people who decide to go there and get embarrassed by the waitresses who may do to you what happened to me.

NO single place will allow their waitresses to do what she did to me that night.  I paid a very fair amount for the work she did and she had the nerve to call me out in front of all my guests.  That is very non-business like and extremely rude.

Only complaint? It was a tad pricey. For the two of us, it ended up being about $50, for an appetizer, two meals, and two drinks (non-alcoholic). More than I expected for Thai food, honestly. We&#39;ll come back, but not as soon, because of that."

Seriously spicy. Like, they&#39;re not f*cking around and you need to have your god damn game face on. As a practically professional heat-seeker, I always opt for the highest spice level at restaurants and then on top of that I ask for it extra, extra whatever that spice number is. Today, I met my motherf*cking match. 

I frequent the Korean CoffeeHaus just a few doors down from Thai Garden (Duchess status, yo!) but had yet to make it in to Thai Garden because my usual CoffeeHaus date has some sort of inexplicable beef with them. So for the past year I just drooled as I looked across the parking at Thai Garden and thought about all that spicy basil tofu going uneaten by me. Today, I decided to take the necessary steps to go forth with my personal goal to get some Thai Garden in my gubby, despite the (IMO unwarranted) badmouthing by my coffee mate. 

I dined alone, which has become the norm for me since my boo hates going out to eat (weird, right?) and I usually eat at off hours so when I say that I dine alone, I mean I&#39;m almost always the only one in the restaurant who isn&#39;t employed by said establishment. I don&#39;t mind eating alone and for the most part, I enjoy doing most things in life by myself just because I know it won&#39;t involve any sort of compromise on my part. Seeing movies, going shopping, exercising, etc-- Lone wolf status is how I like to play it, but today, well... today I wished I&#39;d gone in with some sort of buddy system after getting a taste of Thai Garden&#39;s spice level. I could have used a friend to coach me through my nose running into my mouth and my lips burning and swelling from the heat but because of my hermit habits, I was left sitting in an empty restaurant with my face on fire, envisioning how badly my butt was going to pay later for what my mouth was feeling now, but I still tried to play it off like a man while mentally chanting a monk-style mantra to get me through the pain.

I made it about a third of the way through my absolutely GIANT extra, extra spicy basil w/tofu dish before I asked for a box. I think I did pretty well considering I&#39;d started with a bowl of Tom Yum soup with tofu as well. The soup was delicious and as a person who is pretty much addicted to lemongrass, I would say the flavor of Thai Garden&#39;s tom yum was one of my favorites, though I do wish the portion was a bit bigger. And again, that spicier-than-a-motherf*cker basil w/ tofu was a giant-ass dish. Defo enough for 2.5 meals. My one critique for the spicy basil would be that the tofu was cut in long strips about 1-inch by 2.5-inches and was awkward to eat and wouldn&#39;t cut well with just a fork like at most places, also, I love to be able to pour or scoop some of the juice from the dish onto the rice, but the way theirs was plated made it very difficult, at time making the dish taste a bit drier than I like. 

Overall I&#39;d say that both my dishes were good, though beyond the spice level of the basil dish, there wasn&#39;t anything that I&#39;m ready totally gush about. But again, I got to give it up to them for having the balls to spice a dish up like that for an unfamiliar to them gringo. Normally when I ask for the crazy spices restaurants take one look at this pale white girl and give me some sissy sh*t, so I LOVED that Thai Garden stepped it up and set my ass on fire.

This Thanksgiving, I&#39;m thankful that I get to work from home on the day after eating at Thai Garden. The &#39;Ocupado&#39; sign on my bathroom door will be working overtime tomorrow while my butt plays the crying game."

It wasn&#39;t anything spectacular and it just seemed like I was spooning a somewhat-spicy soup over rice. And for the price, it just didn&#39;t seem like a valuable meal. I had a lot left over, but I didn&#39;t even think it worth taking home for leftovers.

My date had some sort of shrimp plate over vegetables, and I think if he had been any hungrier than he was, it would have been severely disappointing considering the price and the tiny size of the entree."

We&#39;ve all developed a dangerous taste for the spicy fried rice  I can&#39;t even remember what else on the menu I&#39;ve had at this point, which isn&#39;t much. 
My only complaint might have to be the pricing/portion. While I will agree with the saying, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; I&#39;m sometimes left feeling I didn&#39;t. Though the flavor is outstanding, I&#39;m sometimes left feeling like i want more because the dishes tend to be heavy on rice and minimal on the substance. At a few dollars more than most Asian restaurant lunch specials, you also get more than just a few bites less. Though I struggle to give this place the 4, I&#39;m a sucker for great flavor.

I was in the mood for Thai, and since it&#39;s so close to my home, I decided to take the S.O. here for dinner.  SO is not an adventurous eater; he likes burgers, pizza, fried chicken, Taco Bell, Doritos, and other assorted boyfood.  It&#39;s not common that he lets me take him out of his comfort zone by coming to an ethnic restaurant, so I was hoping that he would enjoy himself.

The atmosphere was a little dim, but also cozy.  Our server couldn&#39;t have been nicer or more attentive; I never had to ask for refills of my iced tea or flag her down for the check.  I ordered the Tom Yum veggie soup and the shrimp/chicken Pad Thai (medium spicy, because I&#39;m a wimp), and he ordered the beef Pad Thai (mild).  All of our food came very quickly, in less than 10 minutes.  The Tom Yum soup was pretty good, with just enough spiciness to tickle my throat.  I would definitely order it again, especially if I had a cold.  The Pad Thai....wow! :-)  It was a nice blend of spices, veggies, tender sliced chicken, huge shrimp, and just a smattering of peanuts.  I&#39;ve been to other restaurants, even Thai restaurants, in which the Pad Thai was covered in peanuts like a sundae.  I&#39;m not much for peanuts and can only tolerate them in small doses.  So I really appreciate that Thai Garden focuses on the meats and spices and not so much on the peanuts (thank you!)

And the servings are huge!  So huge that I could only eat half of my order.  But at least I have the other half for lunch tomorrow!  (Yayee!)

My SO enjoyed his beef Pad Thai, and cleaned his plate.  He still has his preferences, but he enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and service enough to want to return again.

As for me, I will most definitely come back.  Especially for the lunch specials!  Bravo, Thai Garden!"

I love onion and don&#39;t mind eating a little more of it. But the proportion was just too much. Duck, not that good either. Tough and chewy. Only 1 or 2 pieces were okay. Basil flavor wasn&#39;t really there. The other dishes we ordered were way too sweet. Maybe just one of those chef&#39;s bad days. I will come back but maybe just for the curry dishes. Panang chicken is one of my favorites here."

Tom Yum Vegetable Soup: still great, still fun to look at (See picture). Sweet, tangy, sour, salty, and light. 

Lad Na Seafood: if you like Chinese Ho Fun this is basically the same thing. Wide rice noodles cooked with squid, shrimp, broccoli, and scallops and covered in this thick gravy. (see picture) It tasted pretty darn good and wasn&#39;t short on tasty bits of seafood.  

Overall I&#39;d up  this place from my last review of 3 stars to 3 and a half for consistency in good food. If your into Thai food, definitely give this place a go!"

This place may not be tops as far as making the best pad thai, or spicy basil chicken , but I think they do a good enough job at everything to earn themselves 3 stars.

Today we got the usual - Shrimp roll app, extra spicy pad thai chicken for me, extra spicy basil chicken(sliced not ground) for Mel, and ordered the spicy chicken fried rice as an extra, just because.  When I got home, the first thing I saw was the clear top of the container of fried rice, which had ground chicken on top of it.  Almost flipped my lid, because I thought they put ground chicken into my wifes dish.(I hate that more than she does).  But I called and asked them to describe the fried rice&#39;s appearance, and that was what they gave me, apparently.  Turned out to be pretty good, it just didn&#39;t look like was I expected

One thing my wife noticed when I got home from ordering out was that on the receipt my name was spelled Keigh.  That was one of the funnier spellings of Keith we&#39;ve seen, and we&#39;ve seen a lot. 

Just like Yelp says, A-OK."

We were beyond disappointed. I asked the waitress for recommendations and she suggested the fried red snapper and any of the fried rice. She said pad Thai also popular. 
My tiny potion of fish was swimming in a red sugar syrup. Really. I have never had such a sweet entree. I ate a lot of plain rice to dilute the sugary taste left in my mouth 
My husband tried the pineapple fried rice. The rice was undercooked and the whole dish had absolutely no flavor. It was as if they were cooking for picky children. We returned pineapple rice and requested the pad Thai. Hubby took one bite and was done. Had zero flavor and was mushy. 
We threw down some money and made a beeline for Wendy&#39;s for a quick bite. 
I don&#39;t know what happened. Maybe the regular chef was not there. But it was so terrible that we won&#39;t give it another try."

One dish, Popeye Chicken, uses the peanut satay sauce and chicken and is served over spinach and rice. It&#39;s a great combination for those who like Thai peanut sauce. The other dish is one in particular that I highly recommend is their Spicy Fried Rice. The name will be misleading because you won&#39;t think anything of it but it&#39;s definitely distinctive. They took traditional Thai fried rice and topped it with ground chicken which has been stir fried with a chili sauce. It&#39;s a sweet and spicy combination that&#39;s really good. Both of these dishes cannot be found anywhere else. 

Save room for dessert because there is one dessert at Thai Garden that you won&#39;t see often at a Thai restaurant, Coconut Ice Cream with Sticky Rice. The combination sounds crazy but you have to try it. It&#39;s ice cream made from young coconut served alongside Thai sticky rice which has been cooked with coconut milk and sugar. It&#39;s the perfect complement to finish the meal since it isn&#39;t too sweet. 

Thai Garden does a good job of offering good customer service and a Thai inspired atmosphere that keeps customers coming back for more. The interior is decorated with a lot of traditional Thai art pieces. Their weekday lunch specials are a great option for lunch meetings if you work around the area."

A huge plate of yummy noodles mixed with tender chicken, chopped green onion, crunchy bean sprouts, ground peanut and egg.  I&#39;ve tried to recreate it at home but there&#39;s something unique in their sauce!  The lunch special includes mild wonton or spicy soup and a regular crispy pork or vegetable egg roll.

I will admit that their seasoned ground beef for the tacos is quite tasty, and I like the fact that you can use as many sauce packets as you like. For those with dairy intolerance you can substitute the cheese from Pico De gallo on some of the offerings. Value meals are usually no more than $6.

Only thing I would improve is the speed of the service. Sometimes it takes as long as 25 minutes to get an order out. Other than that, recommended place for inexpensive dining."

Laura: Around 12:40pm today, we went to the drive-thru.  The cashier, Dominick, was very friendly and took our order accurately.  The food took a little long to prepare, but our order contained many items (a #3 combo for Ash as usual, as well as a Mexican Pizza and 2 tacos for me and Pedro). We went home, and I gave Ash his food.  He asked if I checked the bag to see if his combo was &#34;supreme&#34;. I said &#34;No, I didn&#39;t check&#34;.

Right away, he fumbled frantically through the wrappers and yelled &#34;GOD DAMN IT, What the hell is this shit!?! Again. Again. AGAIN?! You gotta me kidding me, dog!&#34;. 

 I gave him the receipt, and he looked at it and saw that it was indeed the supreme combo I ordered.  He just said &#34;We gotta tell Yelp about this cuz they keep doing this to me&#34;.  Anyway, Pedro and I enjoyed our food just fine.

Ash:  Disrespected by Taco Bell AGAIN.  Look, at #3 combo is Supreme (has tomatoes and sour cream on them). The #8 is the one without tomatoes and sour cream.  Why do they keep doing this to me? This ain&#39;t the cashier&#39;s fault, but why can&#39;t the kitchen do it right?  I yelled at my half-sister and I regret that.  It ain&#39;t her job to have to check the accuracy of my order.

I am hurt and angry.   Thank God they included my side of avocado ranch, or I woulda confronted this situation directly.

Then tonight, when pizza sounded like a good dinner choice I picked up another pizza from them. It was as good as last time.  It was tasty, fresh, and consistently good.  So I guess I need to get with the program and readjust my thinking!

TIP: It&#39;s not much of an eat-in kinda place. They have two tables.  It&#39;s really more for carry out.  Either way you can&#39;t  park near the entrance on Northwest Highway, so drive around the back.

Wayne&#39;s is a small takeout/delivery spot that has been a favorite in Arlington Heights and surrounding suburbs for MANY years. 

We usually order Wayne&#39;s when the craving hits, or if we&#39;re too lazy to cook. Usually, the craving hits. :)  

Their thin crust pizza is thin and crispy with a slight chew to it which makes it simply irresistible. The sauce is flavorful, yet light so it&#39;s not overbearing. Their cheese blend is ooey-gooey goodness. At Wayne&#39;s they&#39;re not afraid to pile on the toppings. We usually order a Medium Thin Crust with extra cheese, pepperoni, black olive, and spinach. The ingredients are fresh and plentiful. 

Whenever I call for delivery, they know exactly where to deliver without needing to provide any info. That&#39;s great service in my book! Delivery is crazy fast and the pizza is always piping hot. They&#39;re delivery is super fast, to the point of being a little bit of an inconvenience. ;) (I was finishing my shower and they were at the door)

If you&#39;re looking for the best thin-crust pizza in the suburbs, look no further. Wayne&#39;s is what you want...what you crave!"

I had an Uber driver tell me this was the best pizza in Arlington Heights so was excited to try it.

It was all right but I think he oversold it.  The ingredients were good but just average overall.

I enjoyed everything about the pizza with the exception of the bread. I was messaged by the owner and he suggested that the double crust might be more up my alley as their thin crust is just that, very thin. 

  We ordered the exact same pizza, with the exception of the crust. Boy was Tony, the owner, right with his suggestion. The double crust is exactly what I was looking for. It was spectacular. Wayne&#39;s Pizza has stolen us as customers from Rosatis!"

They do a great job.
Crunchy crust that&#39;s a baked correctly, nice, well balanced sauce and their toppings, including the cheese, where fresh and full of flavor.

Skills, that is.

No frills. All pie.

Worth picking up to go, fo sho. 

I&#39;ll edit this after I finish eating.

Ok and here we go...

The crust (ordered well-down) is almost a pretzel. So twisted, crispy, and not over powering. It was dense and firm so it held the juicy toppings of onion, green peppers, sausage, and spinach effortlessly. 

The fresh tomatoes on the top were so sweet and herbed. They melted like sauce. Sweet, sweet sauce. 

The toasted, gooey cheeses were so delicious. Not too much but definitely enough.

The veggies were fresh and tasty. I LOVE THIS PIZZA!!!

Even though they don&#39;t deliver to me, 3.3 miles away, I&#39;ll definitely be ordering more frequently. I&#39;m sorry, now, that I&#39;ve waited so long to order from these masters of pizzaology. 

My pie was ready in 30 minutes, or so they say, for pickup. I got it fresh out of the oven and uncut so all the juices stayed in the pie and not all over the box.

On the passenger seat next to me it sat all the way home, still piping hot as I rolled my cutting wheel through the caramelized cheeses and crust.

What to order:

Appetizer:
Good ol&#39; French Fries
Mozzarella sticks
Chili Pepper and cheese bites

Main Dish:
1. Thin crust sausage - Keep it simple if you&#39;re a first timer to this place, their known for their thin crust sausage. Don&#39;t attack the pizza with salt and pepper, red flakes or Parmesan until you&#39;ve tasted it and THINK that it MAY need it.

OR

2. Deep Dish Pan Pizza - Wayne&#39;s is known for their thin crust but employees and fans will tell you that their Deep Dish is just as amazing. I order Sausage Bacon or Sausage Giardinera.

For the adventurous:
Try a BBQ chicken pizza with onion, and some cheddar cheese. ;)

Their thin crust and double dough pizzas are only fair. The cheese is rather hard tasting and they are not generous with toppings except for the less expensive items. There is very little tomato/spicy taste.

Some of their side orders can be good (onion rings, breaded cauliflower, seasoned fries, and chicken wings when they are hot and fresh tasting. They do not travel very well however and this is a pickup or delivery restaurant only. If you order these items for delivery watch out.

Their delivery service is reliable though the food doesn&#39;t always taste freshly prepared (including the pizza). However if you pick up when they&#39;re crowded you can be ignored which can cause delays in getting your already prepared food.

This place is substantially overrated."

I&#39;m from Michigan originally where we have delicious Detroit style pizza or normal pizza. I don&#39;t understand why normal pizza isn&#39;t an option in Chicago, it&#39;s either deep dish or thin-crust cardboard pizza with no flavor.

The crust is like cardboard, the sauce is ok, the cheese is bland (is it unsalted?). We got a veggie pizza (spinach and mushroom) and there was pretty much no flavor. I&#39;ve never wanted to put salt on a pizza before but I did on this one. The meat pizzas are better since they actually seem to have a little sodium in them. The yelp ratings of this place baffle me.

Right now I&#39;m eating their deep dish which is also excellent.

The place is located right off of Northwest Highway by Arlington Park.  
Take-out and they do deliver.  
Pizzas, that&#39;s all I have to say.  You can tell the ingredients are fresh and made to order.  When you walk in to pick up your order you can even see them making the pizzas like a well oiled machine.
The thin crust is so good, it&#39;s crisp, but not too hard.  It&#39;s chewy, but doesn&#39;t get soggy.  
The deep dish is great to.  Not like normal Chicago deep dish where you&#39;re full after 1 piece.  This, you can eat 2 or 3 pieces.  Which I love cause I love eating.

If you&#39;re in the Palatine, Arlington Heights, Rolling Meadows area, definitely go there for pizza.

This place was a disappointment on an epic level. I have a five year old boy so we visit our fair share of these quick serve type places. It looks very modern and bright and they are going for a New York loft look with a West Coast vibe. They have salads, soups, and sandwiches/ paninis. I ordered the pick two combo with a panini and salad (similar to panera&#39;s you pick two deal). The sandwich was underwhelming and not crispy enough for a panini, and tasted underwhelming. The salad..... oh Lordy that&#39;s a whole other story. You can opt to order one of the salads from the menu or a make your own, which I opted for. They pre dressed the lettuce to the point where the entire heap of lettuce was sliding around the bowl in an unappetizing pile of gloppy soaked greens. Also, they must have been told to be very exact about the portions, but there&#39;s something so bothersome about watching them literally count out 5 cherry tomatoes and three minuscule pieces of chicken. I watched them actually pick a cherry tomato OFF my salad because it was one too many, and that was very unappetizing. I also really love olives and asked for a few extra and they absolutely refused. This REALLY irked me. A few extra olives isn&#39;t going to make or break your M.O. When I go to NafNaf or Chipotle and ask for a few extra veggies on my salad, it&#39;s never an issue, and why I continue bringing my business there. Also, I was supposed to get one protein and 5 toppings, but they insisted that the chicken was part of the five and I wasn&#39;t about to argue.  They had to remake it because of too much dressing and I never send food back. 
Lastly, the guy came by to take our trays and when he asked how everything was, I told him- kindly but honestly. I was shocked when no manager came out to speak with us. 
For my first time trying this chain restaurant, I&#39;ll never, ever go back. Stick to your old fast casuals and save a trip."

We headed over the same night, so expectations are running high!

Super friendly people that were very helpful and super fresh high quality food.

If you do a single item (sandwich, soup, salad) it is very filling. Doing the 2 combo item is having a FULL sandwich with half soup or salad, it&#39;s a lot of food and you get bread with the soup and everything comes with a Chocolate covered Strawberry. 

Roasted Pepper and Lobster soup - it&#39;s a bit of a kick with nice little pieces of lobster. I truly enjoyed dipping my soft bread into the soup and eating it. It was soooo good, very creamy, slightly salty, a little bit of spicy, and some nice lobster taste even without eating the lobster pieces.

Pesto Chicken sandwich - I used the artisan whole wheat bread, it was nice, crusty, and had some good pops of wheat grains in there for texture.  Nice strips of chicken and good pesto. I enjoyed it but it was overshadowed by the soup, which is odd because I am not generally a soup guy. I totally could have just had the soup by itself.

Chocolate Hazelnut Creme Brulee - so apparently these things are 50% off after 8. It tasted like nutella creme brulee, it was soo yummy. The chocolate on the top was the best, rich thick and creamy and just the right amount of sweet to remind you that it&#39;s dessert time!

Drinks: I tried all 4 of the drinks, a cucumber green tea, coconut something, orange and berry something and lemonade. I enjoyed a mix of 2/3 lemonade with 1/3 orange and berry. I will probably pass in the future since they are lightly sweetened with raw honey (very good for your health) and I didn&#39;t want to add more sugar to it. So I&#39;ll stick with nice healthy water.

The decor and bathrooms are all so relaxing and very nicely detailed. I am very pleased.

I&#39;ll be back for sure!"

Update: 11.12.16
Not so impressed this time around. Got the &#34;crab and avocado melt&#34; sandwich comes with artificial &#34;krab&#34; meat salad and unfortunately mine arrived without avocado. Super disappointing. Then I ordered the Wisconsin cauliflower cheddar soup, tasted wonderful but was served lukewarm. I know that they were busy thanks to just opening and sending out coupons. But I was absolutely bummed. I would have said something but due to the busy hour and fast casual atmosphere I wasn&#39;t even able to attempt to speak to anyone. Maybe I&#39;ll give them a chance again, but avoiding that faux crab sandwich like the plague."

It is right down the street from my work and we are always interested in new lunch options, so we went to check it out.  Cafe Zupas made a great first impression.  The space was clean, bright, and modern-looking.  Plenty of fresh ingredients and custom fruit juices were immediately on display.  The whole thing kind of had a &#34;Whole Foods&#34; vibe to it, but for the Woodfield area the prices were actually fairly reasonable.

The staff was very friendly and perky for the grand opening.  There was even a staff person in line to help new customers with the menu and provide recommendations.  I myself did the Pick 2 Combo for about $9, along with a drink.  I usually don&#39;t order that much for lunch, but I wanted to get the full experience.  I got the Honey Cilantro Carnitas sandwich, which was very tasty.  It wasn&#39;t exactly a warm sandwich, so you know, but it was flavorful and the meat was very tender.  They gave me the option of ancient grain bread, but I went with the standard bread this time.  Even the regular bread was rather good.

For my soup I got the Roasted Red Pepper &amp; Lobster.  It was very flavorful, but did not have large chunks of lobster - just some ground up bits.  Overall it was pretty good, if not amazing, but for a cup of soup from a sandwich shop, it did the job.

The Pick 2 Combo came with a small chocolate-covered strawberry, which was a nice touch.  It also came with a plain roll, in case you need more carbs in your life.  And finally, a tempting assortment of desserts was on display near the cash register, in case that little strawberry is not enough to sate your sweet tooth..

I mixed a few of the fruit juices from the juice bar and found it refreshing and not overly sweet.  It seemed that most (all?) of the juices were sweetened with honey, so there is a distinct honey flavor.

All things considered Cafe Zupas shows great promise.  I really enjoyed my sandwich, the customer service was great, and the menu has an intriguing variety of options to try next time.  We are sure to be back here again."

Yes, there are a many fast casual places in the &#39;burg, but Cafe Zupas appeals to sole eaters and family alike, healthy and &#34;splurging&#34; eaters, and keeps the prices super affordable for all. 

Let&#39;s talk about the good:
-The tomato basil soup was deeeelicious. A bit salty but really flavorful! 
-Kid&#39;s grilled cheese was on point, albeit basic 
-As mentioned, very affordable combos at $8.99 per adult (includes a full sandwich and a soup or salad) and $4.19 per child
-Local and regional ingredients aplenty
-Chocolate strawberry included in all combos 
-Staff was very, very friendly and welcoming
-Interior is modern and ridiculously shiny clean

The few mehs:
-Ordering for multiple people (at once) can be complicated as you first order sandwiches, then salads, then soups, then dessert. So if you have four meals to order (for one family) you have to remember the matrices of each meal as you roll along. 
-My salad was over dressed (but I&#39;m a bit sensitive to soggy lettuce), so next time, dressing on the side 

I&#39;ll definitely be back...can you imagine if they did curbside pickup? Cafe Zupas, can you help a mama out?"

It has a very clean vibe and the prices are all reasonable. Once people find out about this place, it&#39;s gonna blow up. It&#39;s like a mix between whole foods and panera.

So we ordered literally everything on the menu. Honey cilantro carnitas, turkey bacon avocado, both sandwiches with the ancient grains bread, garden chicken cobb, asian citrus chicken, wisconsin cauliflower soup, new England clam chowder, creme brulee cheesecake, salted caramel creme brulee, rockslide bar, and 2 of the raw honey infused drinks.

Yeah, a little of everything. The half salad and whole sandwiches were $8.99. For the quality, I think that&#39;s a bargain!

And everything was so good. The soups they let you sample before you get so you know you&#39;re gonna like it. 

The raw honey drinks are AMAZING. Plus raw honey has awesome health benefits, with aiding in digestion being one of them so get it!! You can taste the honey in there but not overwhelming. So good! I recommend the orange berry infusion. Yum!

The sandwiches were good. The honey carnitas one was the better one of the two. My salad was amazing. I&#39;d come back just for the salad and drinks,  for a light lunch :)

Each meal comes with a roll and a freshly dipped strawberry. The strawberry is sweet and a really great touch. 

Omg the creme brulee is so good. I&#39;m a huge creme brulee fan and they have so many options (salted caramel, berry, and chocolate hazelnut). It makes me so happy.

The cheesecake is really good too. I&#39;ve been craving cheesecake so I had to get that too. 

The rockslide is very chocolaty and has tons of caramel on top. It&#39;s good if you like chocolate!

Everyone there is friendly and courteous. They want to help you. 

I think I ordered too much and I ended up being way too full for lunchtime but I had a lot of to go boxes.

I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll be coming back many more times and bringing people here.... as long as they never change :p"

The lobster bisque tastes like anything you&#39;d find in Maine (minus the chunks of lobster meat).  The chicken pesto panini oozes goodness.  The salads looked intriguing, I will be back tomorrow to try one.  Brownies are heaven.  

They even give you a chocolate covered strawberry!  Woohoo!  

Everyone provided top notch customer service with friendly attitudes.

Now that Sweet Tomatoes is gone, this is certainly a nice alternative (a step up in my opinion!).

The only disappointment for me was the lack of a chicken noodle soup option.  But, I guess that will just keep the flu-ridden and contaminated customers away, so that is good.  They can go infect Panera people instead!

Check this place out.  It&#39;s pretty cool."

The guy at the line was very helpful and friendly. I&#39;m only giving it 3 stars because of the cashier. My boyfriend ordered a soup and was asked if he wanted cheese. Without knowing that it would cost 69 cents extra, he added parmesan. When we got to the register, goat cheese was also added and charged on the ticket. Before he paid he explained that he didn&#39;t ask for the goat cheese and the cashier was just like &#34;sorry about that&#34; but still charged us for it. I know that it&#39;s only 69 cents extra but it&#39;s the fact that it should have been taken off and he should have only been charged for the cheese he asked for. After that, we spoke to another person in the store about it and still, nothing was done."

However, the poor service and B grade food cause us not to frequent Chandler&#39;s as often as we would prefer, despite the reasonable prices.

We have been forgotten about while outside on the patio more than once. During our last visit, after the waitress never came to pick up the check, I actually had to take it to the bar to pay for our meal.

While the ribs are very good, most of the food is B - grade.

However, the food and drinks are reasonably priced and the patio experience can be a very pleasant setting."

It is located on the golf course, so of course we saw many golfers (most of which seemed intoxicated). We decided to sit outside, which ended up being an alright choice. It was a very nice day out, and later when I went inside I wasn&#39;t impressed with the atmosphere. It is very dark and has an old school lounge feeling...but not in a good way. The bathrooms were disgusting...I&#39;m not sure when they cleaned them last.

Our server was very nice, but they didn&#39;t have enough staff that night, so we barely saw her. Or anyone for that matter. She was gracious that we were patient, so we did get a few drinks off of our bill. However, the management either needs to hire more people or make sure that they have enough people on staff. 

When I looked at the menu, I was surprised at how reasonably priced everything was. I decided to get the steak/potato special, which also came with a salad and bread. The bread was very good, but the salad was pretty plain. They brought the wrong dressing, and had to go back. Then my steak was very well done...I ordered it medium. The presentation wasn&#39;t anything to brag about either.

The one good thing - they make strong drinks. Kudos to you bartender. Needless to say, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it and I probably won&#39;t be returning."

The whole process of working with chandlers was a complete nightmare.  Kim was our &#34;planner&#34; and she was terrible in every way. Her communication skills are the worst I&#39;ve ever seen and she acts as if she&#39;s never planned a wedding before.

During our rehearsal dinner, which she was suppose to be in charge of, she just kept leaving with no warning and was gone for 20 minutes at a time.  We ran the rehearsal ourselves. 

Our outdoor ceremony site was a complete mess. It was under construction and extremely unsafe. Chandlers offered 0 support to get that fixed. We had to spend all night getting our florist up to date with fixing it and had to pay her more money. Chandlers refused to split the bill with us. 

So we sent the florist out early to set everything up and chandlers ripped them all up and threw everything in a corner. Because they had a booked a party til 430 when our wedding started at 5. So we couldn&#39;t take our pictures because the place was packed with a bunch of over served people who were wasted.  

Luckily our vendors that we choose were amazing and we all worked together to get this going, no help from Chandlers.  The wedding started and Kim was suppose to be there all day setting everything up and getting people in the right spots. She did nothing of the sort. She set up nothing, I was scrambling around at 515 looking for programs and the bouquets and everything else she was suppose to do. 

During the reception Kim was supposed to be there all night. I never saw her after 6pm, she is awful. We had requested stations but instead we&#39;re given a buffet.  The floor plan showed one thing and we got something completely different. There were people that we didn&#39;t invite and didn&#39;t know hanging out in our lounge area and dancing in our lounge area.  

The night was a big hit due to the DJ and the way we designed everything. But absolutely everything Chandlers had to do with they failed completely.  They didn&#39;t follow through on anything they said they would do. Kim is impossible to work with and she is very bad at her job. Bob Whitehead is the manager and he is a complete jerk and needs to be fired. He not only refused to help us, but was a complete jerk about it. 

I would never recommend this place to anyone and if you&#39;re getting married there be prepared to do everything."

Kim was my wedding planner and minister ;-) 
I have no complaints and had a great experience during my wedding planning. The ceremony area is beautiful!!! They have a nice fountain and flowers along the isle. 
Kim was very helpful and accommodating to my needs. Any linen color you want, Chandlers has it.  They throw in a lot of extra stuff too.  I didn&#39;t have to bring any decorations.  Kim had all the center pieces for me already.  There are a few different options for food.  We went with the buffet stations.  Everyone favorite was the sirloin steak.  The mashed potato bar served in martini glasses was a huge hit.  Everyone raved about the food and went for seconds and even thirds. The prices are affordable and you get the venue, food &amp; entertainment all in one lump sum.  Everyone had a great time and I would definitely recommend Chandlers to others. 

I like Chandlers during summer the most.  They have a nice patio overlooking the golf course. Clean and a very friendly staff.  I had the chicken strips with tater tots.  The chicken was very moist.  My husband had the Filet sliders and said they were excellent.  My son had the burger and tater tots.  The burger was huge and very filling."

He did a fine job trying to be the waiter,the bartender, the chef. The food was presented nicely but had no taste. I must say for 63.00 I should be reimbursed. The calamari was flat. The filet sliders had no taste they were dry.  The chief cook and bottle washer just can&#39;t do it all. All the food was just bad tasting. We didn&#39;t want to complain because he was trying.

Eh this is rather a average restaurant located in a golf course. My father always had raving reviews from his monthly chapter meetings here and we decided to give it a try during rib-eye Saturday. 14.99 for 10 oz ribeye, veggie, potato, and soup or salad. I was excited that this would be similar to Omega another diner type experience. I believe that the restaurant can do better with the hostess... the greeting did not feel at all welcoming or friendly. We were quickly seated and the ordering process was painless. Clearly there were a bunch of regulars here as well having dinner. The bread was top notch, fresh from the oven and our waitress even brought seconds. My main meal was less than eventful with a very thin cut ribeye which made a medium rare taste well done. The sides were your run of the mill potato options (fries, etc.). I will have to think about if I will return in the future with so so service and food that could be improved upon.

Pro- daily dinner specials. low prices compared to other restaurants

Con- unfriendly service, very thin cut ribeye (it would be better if the 10 oz was with a thicker cut steak)

Hidden deal- Daily dinner specials"

I have been here several times and it is the same story.  I wouldn&#39;t go back if it were up to me but my family insists on returning all the time.

Your dry run, after remodel, was the worst ever.
Only allowing 4 people per table and splitting up our family and not even allowing us to sit in the same section or near each other.
Giving me a OBVIOUSLY filthy glass. FILTHY !!!! 
Have a new waitress who is clearly NOT ready to do it alone. My mother order a Araretto stone sour and she said we don&#39;t have a blender to make that. WHAT??!!! Really. 
Waiting an hour and 1/2 for our food, watching several people who came after us eat. We had them bag it as at that point we weren&#39;t hungry anymore.

It was one of the worst experience I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant. 
The manager wouldn&#39;t know this as they were NO where to be found.
Kind of strange as this was a dry run to re opening, you&#39;d think they&#39;d be visiting tables."

Food was very mediocre though. Came on a Wednesday night for burger night, had a wonderful waitress, but again the food was super average, nothing to rave about. We went there tonight for my fiancés birthday and we had to wait to be seated even though there were 20+ tables open. We waited at the bar and I had a glass of wine, I was very unimpressed with the wine selection. My fiancé had the strip steak &amp; enjoyed it. I had the twin filets and ordered them rare and stressed that I prefer my meat extremely rare if possible. When I got it, it was medium. I told our waitress, who by the way was very friendly but flustered because she was so busy because they were clearly under staffed, and she apologized &amp; took it back. When I got my new steaks they were medium rare :( I didn&#39;t send it back though because we had already been there for a while. We really wanted to come in on a Sunday because we heard the chicken special was really good, but I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll just be disappointed again:/"

The seating could use a little updating and this is more of an older crowd.  A good place to bring the family, grandpa and grandma too.

I was here this time for a wedding shower for a dear friend. The space was decorated beautifully, the servers were wonderful. My only complaint is that they kept mixing up the diet and regular pop on the table at the front of the room (they did it several times) which frustrated a few people. Overall though, the experience was great. My friend was treated like a princess, and they held the meal for awhile as several guests were running late without complaining. The food was served family style, and I enjoyed all of it- especially the mashed potatoes. They also allowed the family to bring in an outside cake for the shower which I thought was very nice. Someday I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll visit here for something other than a special event- but they do a great job with special events. I would definitely recommend this location for a bridal shower."

I assumed it was only for the golfers. I&#39;m glad I stopped by.

I usually dont order a strip steak due to it&#39;s chewiness and less quality flavor as compared to filets and ribeyes. However, the bartender suggested their Tuesday night special, &#34;steak and bake&#34; for an incredible price of $12.99. I was truly amazed by this juicy, tender, amazingly tasty, and surprisingly thick strip steak. No A1 steak sauce was required. This had just enough fat to melt in your mouth without getting chewy. It had such a juicy flavor that I recommended it to the couple sitting across from me. They ordered it as well and loved it too!

I will definitely stop by on another Tuesday hoping to get the same tender juicy steak over and over again..."

Spoke recently with a friend and neighbor who asked if we had been to Chandler&#39;s recently as it had been a while for her and she had taken a gentleman friend who hadn&#39;t ever been there.

We had the most horrible experience  with their customer service and they are very unprofessional.  Leading up to the wedding, we had signs that they were disorganized and dropped the ball, but once you book the venue you can&#39;t really change your date/venue.  During our walk through three days before the wedding, I took extra caution in being OVERLY descriptive and step-by-step in a list of all the items for them to set up, along with labeled boxes of everything (and even pictures of how it should be set up).  The day of the wedding was a extremely disorganized - there were so many things that went wrong.  Nobody took control even though they promised that they would &#39;own&#39; the timeline for the night.  
* We were told there was another outdoor wedding at 4:30 pm which would not interfere with our cocktail hour on the terrace at 6 pm.  Upon my wedding party arriving at 6:15 pm, all my guests were crammed in the lobby while the other wedding had just started at 5:30 pm (we were told this would not be a problem/conflict).  My friend arrived at Chandler&#39;s early to take control of everything, since she got married at Chandler&#39;s and was cautious about making sure nothing went wrong.  She was guiding guests from the other wedding to go upstairs to their reception, since Chandler&#39;s staff was not taking control.
* The cocktail terrace was not ready until 6:30 pm, and my friend had to demand that the guests from the other wedding leave the terrace. Meanwhile, their guests wandered into my ballroom, confused and thinking that was where their reception was. This set back the entire timeline on our wedding, causing our guests not to eat dinner until 9 pm (with many complaints from the guests).  There was no manager or direction from anyone at Chandler&#39;s to tell guests to go inside to the ballroom when dinner started.  I was assured that Chandler&#39;s would coordinate with the band to make an announcement and take control of the timeline.  We did not know who was in charge throughout the night. 
* One of the boxes with all of my decorations was not set up. The candy buffet was also not set up, and Chandler&#39;s outlined in the contract that they would set up the candy buffet. Again, my friend set out all the jars and filled them with candy and refilled throughout the night.  
* Per the contract, my florist was providing a cake topper of flowers. Chandler&#39;s could not find the cake topper and was scrambling. Again, my friend found the cake topper in the fridge.  It was outlined in the contract that the florist was providing a floral cake topper.
* We paid $250 extra for the video montage slideshow. Before the reception, my friend made sure the DVD was set out and reminded the staff. After the dinner and toasts, Chandler&#39;s staff forgot to play it. I had to remind them, and they played it over the dinner music with both the slideshow and dinner music blasting over each other (dinner music was not shut off). 
* The staff took my mother&#39;s plate away while she was visiting guests at tables and she wasn&#39;t done eating.  When she asked for her salmon, they said they only had beef left. As the mother of the bride, this was upsetting that she could not eat.
* Finally, there was confusion on my cylinder vases post-wedding. My parents picked up all of my belongings after the wedding, and Chandler&#39;s had demanded that we call our florist to come pick up the vases, otherwise they would toss them. It was written in the contract for both the florist and Chandler&#39;s that I had provided 54 vases, yet Chandler&#39;s did not pay attention and the vases were lost (over $200 worth of glassware).  After much runaround after my honeymoon, my husband and I showed up at Chandler&#39;s to look for the vases ourselves.  Sure enough, they were locked in a closet by the bathroom.  
We met with Chandler&#39;s in person to explain our dissatisfaction and demand answers. They took accountability for nothing and NO apologies.  They gave us a run around for about another 6 weeks with excuses on why they couldn&#39;t meet with us again with an explanation.  First they had to pull the Park District tapes to understand the timeline. Second, Bob had fallen and was in the hospital. Then they lost electricity. Finally they got back to us and said there was no problem with the timeline, and the reason they got behind was because of our band. They BLAMED our band. Our band came up to us after toasts and explained that we were way behind on timeline and needed to move things quickly, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t get a chance to play. They certainly were in tune to the timeline.  Chandler&#39;s is awful, and the way they handled all of our mistakes was by complete denial and no accountability. They are not wedding professionals and I would never recommend a wedding here.  We had a big wedding of 250 guests, and all of them noticed the disorganization and know that they also would never use Chandler&#39;s."

Chandlers- where can I begin.... only with a warning to NOT host your wedding at this venue if you are potentially considering it.  

My brother&#39;s wedding ceremony and reception was held there on 5/17/2014.  What a mess.  From the beginning when we walked in there was no assistance provided by Chandler&#39;s coordinator Kathy-- she popped in  to the bridal suite for about 5 minutes at the start to tell my sister in law she &#34;looked great!&#34; and then was nowhere to be seen for the rest of the evening.  

There was no communication as to what was to take place, and everyone was left on their own.  For the bride and groom&#39;s &#34;first look&#34; there was a Chandler&#39;s employee showing someone around on the gazebo area and NOT MOVING even after I said, &#34;hey! they are going to do the first look now!&#34; (something that should have been Kathy&#39;s job)  Clearly they care about trying to rope in new business, but did not give a crap about existing customers.  

Grounds were terrible-- bright orange tape running all over the greens--No flowers, tons of construction, nothing being done to hide the work during an OUTDOOR CEREMONY.  Also there was no direction on where we COULD take pictures, (again, Kathy was not present) but plenty of notice from Bob, the manager at Chandler&#39;s, about where we could not stand.  Any location we walked to, we were quickly told by Bob in a rude tone that it was a &#34;danger zone&#34; and to get out, but not given any alternatives on where we could stand for photos.  Adding a joke about the bride being hit by flying golf balls does not make your rude comments to move  funny, or OK.  Not even close.  You would expect a lot more from a manager, but not Bob!  Total nightmare!! The coordinator was nowhere to be seen.  Thanks Bob and Kathy for ruining the photographs and the mood of the bride right before the wedding ceremony! Super Job!  

On to the dinner- food was good, but the kitchen ran out of prime rib for some of the guests.  Not acceptable when you are running out of the higher priced dish that has already been paid for.

Highlight of the evening, the DJ Marty-- he was excellent!

WARNING to all brides-- DO NOT HOST YOUR WEDDING AT CHANDLERS.  Will be posting this review to as many review boards as possible so that future weddings will not have to  deal with the mess my brother and sister in law did.  

Brides:  Do yourself a favor: DO NOT HOST YOUR WEDDING AT CHANDLERS"

Amazing ribs, and the half slab of ribs with chicken fingers is a tasty combo. Anything fried here is superb: chucken, fries, kalamari, onion rings, zucchini, etc. always a golden brown. 

My favorite is the crab legs. My wife knows its going to be a long meal when I order them on account of how much you actually get. Verrry good all around. 

I haven&#39;t been there for burger or steak night but have heard rave reviews. 

They have a set menu but alternate between specials and seasonal things. It keeps my favorite restaurant fresh (and even after I try something new and delicious, we&#39;ve got to go back soon bc the crab is amazing!!)"

The back half of the remodeled area was PACKED.Let me add that it was 7pm. Past the typical dinner hour. The inside had 2 tables with people. The man seating us (we thought he was there playing golf they way he was dressed) sat us in the furthest corner under a cold vent at a teeny tiny table. We then sat almost 15 min before someone came. I was on call for work so we told our waitress that we may have to leave quick. She asked us for our drink order and we gave her our entire order. It took 9 min for her to bring our drinks and our salads. She showed up 2 minutes later with the bread. When our entrees came (I ordered well done and if I can figure out how to get the pictures here I&#39;ll show you what they think well done is.) there was no where on the table to put our dishes. I had to give up my salad before finishing it. My plate sat 1/3 off the table. The waitress asked twice if we wanted her to remove something from our table for more room to let her know. I don&#39;t know what she could have taken away to make more room. The food was decent. The salad was also on a tiny plate, no way to move the lettuce around without it falling on the table. This is where my husband and I got married in &#39;05 and every once in awhile we go back. We also had my sister in laws baby shower here. Seriously debating if we will ever go back with the way it is now."

Good:
- Prices were the most reasonable I&#39;ve seen in Schaumburg.  $17.99 for a good steak, $12.99 for pastas, $7.99-$9.99 for sandwiches with lots of daily specials
- Most entrees included a salad and a choice of side
- The rustic pasta was delicious, and generously sized
- Ample space, nice views of the golf course

Bad:
- Service was horrific until more tables got seated near us, and then the server had to come around to us
- Definitely more of an older crowd
- Don&#39;t get the rosemary chicken"

We went for the fish fry (Lake Perch) since we enjoyed it so much at Snuggery. Very disappointed however. The fish was  overcooked and dry and had WAY to much batter on it. The service was terrible. Took 20 minutes just to get our check. Managers were standing around BS ing at the bar instead of taking care of business and their customers. Not sure if we will be back.

When the waitress finally came to take our order, we asked if we could get some bread and crackers....she replied, yes that will come with the soup or salad. Very rude in the way she answered.
We also never received the crackers, when we asked for him the waitress informed us that she would have to go in the basement to get them.....ummm, ok, what kind of reply is that?  What place that serves soup with your meal, does not have crackers on hand??!!??  So we ask again,can you get them? and she replies, well they are in the basement!!  Anyways, she comes back 10 mins later with one pack of crackers and doesn&#39;t say anything to us.

We had a reservation and were promptly seated. Overall, the service was fast and friendly even though it was getting busy for a Friday in Lent.  We went for the fish fry 2 yrs ago and really liked it.  This time all was very good except for the fish itself. Last ime it was moist and tender, this time kinda dry. Service was great, price was good, and by the way...

If you like a good garlic salad dressing - THIS ONE ROCKS!

So... Everything was good about this experience except for the fish.  I&#39;m willing to give it one more try sometime, but kinda disappointed in this trip."

I immediately thought of Chandlers for the fish fry.  I&#39;d had their fish fry in the past, and told my friend that it was very good.  
We made a reservation for 7:00 pm and off we went.  We both ordered the fish fry dinner, and it was not what I expected or remembered.  The plates came out and the cod was served in skinny strips which resembled calamari.  I thought they&#39;d brought us the wrong food until I tasted it, and it and found that it was indeed cod.  It wasn&#39;t very good, and we didn&#39;t finish our fish let alone ask for the second helping that comes with the dinner.
The waitress was borderline rude.  When she asked for our drink order, I asked her what was on draft.  She replied that nothing was on draft.  I then asked for a beer list, and she said they didn&#39;t have one and proceeded to rattle off a list of bottled beers.  It was surprising that nothing was on draft since they had a full bar.  Where were the taps?
After a mediocre dinner, and mediocre service, we decided to go elsewhere for dessert.  I&#39;m glad we did.  I was embarrassed to have recommended Chandlers for the fish fry."

There are tv&#39;s, a bar, and a fireplace in this clubhouse type restaurant.  My gf and I both got the Butt Steak (actually is part of the shoulder, not the ass) and that came with soup or salad and two sides.  We each got the minestrone which was Gluten Free or not depending on if you wanted noodles (awesome), my gf also got the salad for 1.99 extra (just typical salad, but good value), then we each got steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes with our steaks.  OH MY GOD.  The steak was divine and so were the sides...there was actually a good taste to the broccoli which is shocking because sometimes it is bland.  The cost of the meal? $35.  Yes, $35 + tip.

But heavens, they do not know how to train their wait staff.  Last summer, after a round of golf, we sat down and I asked the waitress what brands of scotch are available; specifically, do they have McClelland 12?  She had no clue.  After a wait, she came back and said they did so I ordered one, neat.  After another even longer wait, she came back and told me the bartender wanted me to know the drink would cost $12.  Un-friggen-believable.  After another even longer wait, I actually got my drink.  Fast forward to this past Wednesday night.  I told a different waitress I wanted a McClelland 12 and please let the bartender know that I know how much it cost.  She came back and told me they are out of McClelland 12.  Oh well.  Almost an hour later the restaurant was emptying and we still had no food.  When asked, the waitress said the kitchen was &#34;slammed.&#34;  I got up and asked to speak to the manager.  The waitress had lied.  She had forgotten to turn in our order.  Like I said, the food is good."

It&#39;s located at the clubhouse of the Schaumburg Golf Course on Roselle Rd.  We first ordered drinks, but they really didn&#39;t have much of anything on tap.  Even the waitress said there was nothing good and she recommended the bottled beers.  I had a Beck&#39;s Dark which was good and my gf had the house wine (only $2.75/glass) and it was decent.  We ordered the sliders as our appetizers and they were tasty so we were looking forward to dinner.  I ordered the London Broil, which was really an 8 oz filet sliced up w/ a mushroom sauce on top.  I ordered it medium, but it was much closer to well done.  It was really nothing special.  For a &#34;Chop House&#34; I expected much better.  My gf ordered the mixed grill which included 1 dry piece of &#34;rosemary&#34; chicken (came with a sprig of rosemary, but no flavor of rosemary on the chicken), a 4oz filet which looked and tasted like something you would get from Ponderosa or Old Country Buffet, and some decent sized butterflied shrimp, which was cooked well and fairly good.  We both ordered the mashed sweet potatoes as our side since it is one of our favorite things to eat when we go out.  This was the first time I didn&#39;t even want to finish eating my sweet potato.  It had your usual spices likes cinnamon, sugar, along with some marshmallows, but there was something else that just really didn&#39;t go well with it.  Despite the food, the waitress was very friendly and seemed to be pretty attentive.  I would only go back for appetizers and maybe a burger."

This is just another one of those places that I happened to stumble upon when we were on our way to go to cascade outdoor movie theater. 
  You are not going to see billboards, flashy lights, etc. in order for you to find this place. Just a yelp review : )
  When my wife and I were in the area, she happened to suggest checking out yelp to see if there was any places located around us to eat.
 That is how I had located Zenwich. So thank you fellow yelpers. 
 When we entered their location. Again nothing flashy just a order menu with some pretty interesting sandwiches. 
 I ordered the Korean cheese steak. When I took a bite into that sandwich, I noticed my mouth like one of those cheesy commercials you see on tv, going crazy with excitement. 
 This sandwich is #$*@ Good!. It was so good I had to order another. And then also one to go. Don&#39;t judge me ; ) 
 What can I say.  When you find something you like, you seem to buy more : ) 
 So if you are in the area, I can only advise to stop here and try one of their sandwiches. I am quite positive that you will not be disappointed. I know that we were not. 

Thanks Yelpers!"

I LOVE bahn mi sandwiches but have had a hard time finding a good / fresh bahn mi in the suburbs (and the city too sometimes). This place is perfect when I get a craving for bahn mi, even though it&#39;s a bit more asian fusion. But don&#39;t let that discourage you! The outside is very unassuming (it&#39;s in a strip mall) but these sandwiches are some of the best bahn mi style sandwiches I have ever had. I tried the shrimp one and my mom tried the chicken satay one. We were both blown away. The sandwiches were warm, bread was so fluffy and soft, and tons of fresh veggies. The shrimp looked fresh too. 

I almost forgot: they have these homemade &#34;chips&#34; with an amazing seasoning on them! YUM!

The flavors will knock your socks off! Prices are not bad either - about $8 bucks for a sandwich. Think outside the box and try this version of bahn mi. You won&#39;t be disappointed!"

I&#39;m so sad to report but, Zenwich is NOT all that... :(

Yes, they have a wide variety of Vegetarian and Vegan options which is a total plus and made me want to eat there but...The meal was mediocre at best. 

Kinda felt like the excitement was gone from the space and whoever was cooking, was just &#34;going through the motions.&#34; :(

Sandwich, was barely warm and the fries we&#39;re not freshly cut, seemed like diner fries and we&#39;re 100% soggy. :(

When I heard about the spicy garlic sandwich it sounded like an Asian style po boy and I knew I had to try it.  Everything about it was great.  Lightly battered, plump shrimp smothered with their sauce in some incredibly soft ciabatta bread.  I also had half of the mu ping sandwich and while it was also amazing, the shrimp did have the slight edge.  I ALMOST went back for dinner and got another shrimp sammy but decided against it.  The chips and ginger cole slaw were pretty decent but weren&#39;t anything that really stole my taste buds away from the sandwich.  The chips were plain for me and the slaw was a little too sweet and saucy.  It would be cool if they could do sweet potato fries.  Regardless, the sandwiches are definitely worth everyone trying and are my new food obsession!"

From the outside, Zenwich is very unassuming. I would say the inside as well. It is quite small--would probably fit 20 people max. When I looked at the menu, I knew this place had to be great! Zenwich offers Asian fusion in the form of sandwiches. They range from Thai, to Chinese, to Japanese, or even Korean! 

We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was moderately busy. I chose the Spicy Garlic Shrimp while my boyfriend had the Spicy Basil Chicken that was a special that day. I subbed the chips for cucumber salad, while he subbed his chips for wasabi coleslaw. To sub, it is 50¢ extra! The total for two sandwiches was around $20. Our sandwiches came out within 5 minutes and everyone is so friendly there!

Overall, we really enjoyed our visit and would definitely come back. I like that every sandwich comes with a side and a pickle (: My boyfriend and I both agreed that our sandwiches lacked some sort of crunch or sourness--I guess that&#39;s what our sides are for! My Spicy Garlic Shrimp was delicious, especially with its arugula; however, I would have really enjoyed if they seasoned the batter for their shrimp. The sandwich was chock full of yummy shrimp with spicy aioli, but the shrimp itself was in desperate need of seasoning."

Well not exactly Italian bread, but it&#39;s probably how I would describe it to anyone that hasn&#39;t been here yet. I tend to like places more when no one knows anything about it vs. places that have 200+ reviews simple because I&#39;m usually disappointed as it seems more overrated. 

As of this moment only tried the Crab Cake Sandwich, Pork Katsu Sandwich, and Spicy Garlic Shrimp Sandwich. Would order all three again. $8.50ish sandwich that now comes with chips. (use to be $7.50ish with no chips) I came on Saturday afternoon possible around 2 and although not standing out the door. Had to walk out as there was no place to stand without being in front/behind someone that was already eating.

I got a delicious tofu-katsu sandwich. No problem there. The issue was my wife ordered first and had to repeat her order three times to the woman at the register. My daughter then ordered her sandwich with unseasoned fries. I then ordered my sandwich, also with unseasoned fries. The woman stared blankly at me after I gave her my order and said &#34;sorry I just totally spaced out. What did you want?&#34; So I repeated it.  Five minutes later our orders are brought to the table. Both my daughter and I get our sandwiches with seasoned chips, not unseasoned fries. Shouldn&#39;t be a big deal, right?

We let the server know and she took away our sandwiches with the chips and the woman behind the counter asked what was wrong and we both said we ordered unseasoned fries. She was confused. We reminded her we had to repeat our orders multiple times and she just must have made a mistake to which she replied &#34;fries will be $2 extra.&#34; Okay. So I get out my wallet and she says it&#39;ll be $5.50 or some amount close to that. I was now confused and asked &#34;but you said the fries are $2 extra. She replied that it&#39;s $2 extra per order IF we get the fries with the sandwich but if we order them after, they&#39;re $2.50 each. Huh? We did order them with our sandwiches we said. &#34;Well that order is closed now, so I have to put it in as a new order.&#34; She saw nothing wrong with this crazy logic.

I gave up and said, please just give us some chips, at this point our sandwiches are getting cold. 

I noticed as we left that there was a Help Wanted sign in the window. I hope the management gets some better help or at least can do some very basic training for the help they already have. The sandwich was good but the service was laughable. And we were the only customers there, so it&#39;s not like they were busy."

I went with my friend Courtney C., who&#39;s been here a few times and said everything was delicious.  I ordered the Pork Katsu, a fried pork cutlet with coleslaw, watercress, a tangy sauce and mustard, served on a toasty bun.  This sandwich was so flavorful for...a sandwich!  I don&#39;t know if the bread is homemade, but the bread is yummy and the ideal size for containing all of the sandwich ingredients.  I like the Asian-inspired spin on the food here.

Sandwiches are served with chips &amp; pickle, but watch out - those chips are spicy!  I like spicy food, but these were a bit much for me.  

You can eat here, but there is a limited amount of tables.  It was super busy when we were here, on a Monday, at 2-3pm!  I&#39;m not sure what this looks like during the lunch rush, probably a lot of to-go orders.  Food comes out fast, but not super fast, since they cook your food as you order it.

I ordered the third most popular item on the menu (didn&#39;t know that at the time)

I read a review about the Satay Sandwich and and have been jonesing for it ever since... I was sure that it couldn&#39;t live up to my expectations. I&#39;ve been talking about going there and that sandwich for so long that my wife Lisa was just as stoked.

Approached with trepidation...

Exceeded expectations... That was one of my (and Lisa&#39;s) favorite sandwiches of all time. Awesome , The owner came over and talked to us for a while, his newplace in downtown Chicago is doing well.. a really nice guy.

So my sandwich came with some spiced potato chips (sure I&#39;d love fries, but the chips were really good) and a regular pickle.

Even though it&#39;s only the third most popular.. I can&#39;t see myself getting anything else I loved it so much.

For those that would like to know the even more popular sandwiches.. The Garlic Shrimp and the Crab Cake Sandwiches are the ultimate big sellers..  but I&#39;m feeling pretty good about my third place explosion of flavor.

4.  Food -  this isn&#39;t your average sandwich shop but it also isn&#39;t extreme.  Anyone can order food here - it isn&#39;t complicated but it also isn&#39;t subway.  Talk to the staff, read through the well described menu- I have to return because there are several sandwiches I&#39;m interested in.

We stepped up to the counter and had a few ideas about what we wanted. We ordered a Chicken Satay sandwich and a Garlic Shrimp sandwich. Both came with homemade chips. Prices were $8-$10 per sandwich. 

Garlic Shrimp: This little pocket of heaven was delicious, very garlicky, very generous amount of perfectly seasoned shrimp 9/10 

Chicken Satay: This sandwich fell WAY short of the garlic shrimp offering, the flavors were bland, there was no pop to this bad boy at all. It needed more curry and some sort of cilantro aioli. 4/10 

Homemade chips: the chips were nice and crunchy but the seasoning salt was very unevenly distributed, some of the chips were salt licks and others had very little flavor. 

At the end of the day I probably won&#39;t be back to Zenwich, but if I do find myself back there I would try different offerings for sure."

Everything looks sooo good but the spicy garlic shrimp sandwich in the rice paper (like a spring roll wrapper) is so delicious I can never seem to order anything else. The menu is great for gluten-free folks and vegetarians, too. Chips have a great spice blend on them that you won&#39;t find anywhere else. This is not going to be drive-through speed and it&#39;s not supposed to be, so keep that in mind if you&#39;re heading there during a busy lunch hour. I love this place!"

Of course it is located in a tiny hole of a restaurant in a strip mall. Enter, order at counter, get number, be seated. I got the pork sandwich, which was basically a take on a bahn mi. It was excellent. Husband got the curry beef sandwich. It had great flavor but was very messy. The shrimp seems to be a really popular option, will probably try that next time. Seating is self-serve and very limited. During peak times the tables are all filled, but they seem to turn over quickly. Will definitely be back!"

Usually I&#39;m not a big sandwich fan because they typically don&#39;t fill me up and I&#39;d rather get something meatier for the price. However, Zenwich did have an interesting menu with an Asian fusion approach to their sandwiches. 

Just like other suburban gems, Zenwich is in the middle of a random strip mall. The space isn&#39;t that big, with maybe 3 or 4 tables and then a small counter space against the wall with around 4 more stools. It seemed like most of the people were taking their orders to go. You order at the counter and they warn you that every sandwich is made to order, so it could take 5-10 minutes to prepare. The guy who rang me up seemed to the be the owner and he was pretty cool. He was giving suggestions about the menu and was just generally making some small talk. He hand delivered all the sandwiches to the tables and I noticed him checking up on everyone to make sure they enjoyed the food. 

I ended up getting the spicy garlic shrimp zenwich. Seeing the words spicy and garlic next to each other on a menu is usually a sure-fire sign of a solid choice. Although I didn&#39;t think it was really that spicy or even had a strong garlic flavor, I still thought it was pretty tasty. The first thing that jumps out at you is the sauce that came in the sandwich. It was kinda like a mild Asian styled ranch sauce, and it was super creamy with just the slightest kick of spice. The shrimp was lightly breaded and fried, and surprisingly there was a decent amount of it in the sandwich. Even though there was a ton of aioli in there, the shrimp flavor still came through. The ciabatta bread was soft in the middle with a crisp crust, while the arugula and cilantro added a nice freshness to the sandwich. Together it kind of had that salad sandwich vibe going on. It also came with homemade chips, which were a nice surprise. Whenever I have a choice between fries and chips, I always go with the fries. These chips though were crispy and had a unique spice seasoning on it (with just the slightest hint of sweetness), which I really liked. 

Overall, it was a pretty solid sandwich. I was slightly disappointed that it was a little weak in the garlic department, but maybe I&#39;m the oddball that wants garlic so strong your breath stank. The total came out to be around $10, so it&#39;s up there in terms of price for a medium sized sandwich, but they do have quality ingredients and original flavors to make it worth it."

Or maybe it&#39;s because, living in Chicagoland, we are spoiled with having so many great sandwich shops on top of all the other amazing dining options...that I guess I just wasn&#39;t amazed. 

What was good? The cheesesteak sandwich was very good. They make a coconut milk based salsa for the sandwich that they mix right there when you ask for it. So the sandwich did have a very fresh taste to it, and it was moderately filling. Good stuff. My wife had the chicken teriyaki sandwich which was good. It was mostly cucumber and other vegetables, but it was a good, light, sandwich. 

What wasn&#39;t so good? The fried calamari appetizer. It isn&#39;t fresh calamari. Take it or leave it. Also...the price. I&#39;m not a cheapskate when it comes to dining out. I have no problem dropping serious coin on a seriously good meal. Two sandwiches, an appetizer, a bottled water (yes...you have to purchase water here) and a root beer was $30. Again...don&#39;t get me wrong...$15/pp isn&#39;t a bad price for dinner. That&#39;s not the problem. But again...in Chicagoland where we are spoiled with amazing delis that will get you a great sandwich &amp; soft drink for $5...it&#39;s just hard to pay triple that and not come away feeling like, &#34;meh&#34;. 

If I&#39;m in the area and hungry I would go back. There is a beef curry sandwich that sounds good. Nice people run this business...and that&#39;s a plus. I like giving my business to nice business owners."

I had heard of Zenwich before, but really did not understand the hype until I walked in there for lunch - the line was out the door! Now, it&#39;s not a very big place to begin with (a lot of people seemed to be placing orders to go), but luckily my group snagged a seat in the midst of the hustle and bustle.

Their menu includes a load of delicious options so choosing one was definitely hard. But hey, more reason to go back and dive into the rest of the menu, am I right?

I ended up going with the ROI (Chicken Teriyaki) sandwich (or shall I say ZENwich) and it was AMAZE-balls. The delicious-ness between those two pieces of bread included grilled chicken, lettuce, grilled onion and mushroom with wasabi infused teriyaki sauce and honey mustard. Need I say more?

They have a few different sides to choose from to accompany your sandwich. I went with the cucumber salad which was excellent - fresh and delicious to say the least. I of course also welcomed a pickle spear on the side (for good measure of course). 

If you&#39;re looking for a whole new foodie adventure, these asian inspired sandwiches are the way to go!"

First of all, if you haven&#39;t figured it out from other reviews, this place is teeny tiny. Yet don&#39;t be dissuaded if you can&#39;t grab a seat at one of the five tables. Just snag your sandwich and get the hell out. Second, I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with whatever you order. I personally went with the Chicken Satay Zenwich with my side of choice being the cucumber salad. To say it was delicious is putting it mildly. Twas just the right mix of flavorful chicken, shredded carrots, tons o&#39; veggies and thin (housemade) peanut sauce. 

You can grab a bottled beverage while you wait for your surely awesome Zenwich. Nom-namaste for everyone (h/t to Danny W)."

Driving past, you really wouldn&#39;t think to maybe stop here.  The sign is faded, it&#39;s located in a little strip mall and seating in limited.  But don&#39;t let that stop you from tasting this hidden gem. Asian inspired ingredients paired perfectly with fresh bread will always have your taste buds going for a ride.  Highly recommend the Famous Remus, Bryanism and the Crab Cake Sandwich.  My friend who is vegetarian, tried the Tofu Ping and said the tofu was prepared perfectly. Their Wasbai coleslaw or seasoned chips gives you the perfect crunch and heat that your sandwich needs for a sidekick.  I&#39;m actually okay with the fact that they don&#39;t offer a lot of options on their menu - it&#39;s just enough to showcase their undeniable craft and passion.  

Highly recommended."

Their sandwiches are the most satisfying lunch you could ask for. HIGHLY recommend the Spicy Garlic Shrimp, Pork Katsu, and the Mu Ping. And the Korean BBQ beef!! I absolutely adore their home made chips, as well as the wasabi cole slaw. I could go on for days. I usually have to save half of my sandwich for later in the afternoon - which always gives me something to look forward to around 3pm. They also have Thai Iced Tea in cans - just as delicious as the real thing :)"

It&#39;s so sad because this place used to be so amazing; dare I even say life changing. I&#39;m going to send an email to let them know, but things have definitely changed in the quality of the food. They upped their prices - which I could care less about since their sandwiches are pretty gourmet and extremely filling. However, their quality went down as they upped their prices. That don&#39;t make no sense to me.

I have no problem paying $9 for one of their sandwiches - I&#39;m just so saddened by the deteriorating quality they&#39;re currently putting out.

I always get either the crab cake sandwich or the spicy shrimp. Before the shrimp used to be so fresh and CRISPY. Now it&#39;s just soggy breading around cold shrimp. I&#39;ve ordered twice since I felt like the quality went down and each time it&#39;s been poor. 

I can&#39;t leave a one star review because I truly do love this place. I&#39;m just really sad to see - from what is seems - that the owners have abandoned their Elmhurst location. Please don&#39;t let that happen Zenwich!

EDIT:
They gave me a free meal. It was still kinda cold, but I love zenwich so much that I can&#39;t just leave them a mediocre review. They really are a one of a kind asian infusion sandwich shop - AND I&#39;M ASIAN."

The location is in a strip mall and has a smallish interior.  It seems most folks took take out orders, but a few - like us - stayed and enjoyed our dinner.  The owner was very nice - he not only explained the menu to us, but showed us sizes that helped us decide what to order/what we could share.  He also chatted with my +1 at the end of the night and, even though we accidentally stayed a little past closing - was chatty and welcoming.

We ordered the calamari strips to share.  I really enjoyed the crust and how large they were (I&#39;d only had calamari slices before).  The sauce was delicious!

After much deliberation (and some apprehension about just HOW spicy the tofu might be..), I ordered the Crabby Yola (crab cake) sandwich. It had a nice blend of flavors, especially with the baby greens and basil sauce.  Knowing it wouldn&#39;t keep well without getting soggy the next day, I forced my +1 to finish the rest of it with me! :)  

My +1 got the ROI (Chicken Teriyaki). The flavors were good, but I think the chicken was a tad on the dry side.  The ginger slaw was OK (a bit runnier than I like), but I really enjoyed the home made chips - they had a great spice!

The owner gave me a stamp card for my next visits.  I&#39;ll have to come back and try the Wasabi Coleslaw and also see when they have a special on Spicy Tofu, since I&#39;m feeling brave! :)"

I&#39;m not a fan of anything too hot and this was the perfect balance of sweet and heat. The other sandwich I tried is nothing to sneeze at. I got the pork katsu and that was seriously delicious. My one complaint was that the place was way to small for the amount of customers they receive, so be careful if you are planning on eating there; avoid the mad lunch rush.

I was looking for a place near O&#39;hare to eat and couldn&#39;t resist checking this place after reading all the great reviews.  The restaurant is located in a small strip mall next to a convenient store.  The inside is small with enough seating for about 20 people.  When the weather is cold, it&#39;s a bit chilly inside.  I guess you can say, it&#39;s a &#34;cool&#34; place to eat.

The boards on the wall showed weekly specials and soup of the day.  There are also pictures of the sandwiches on the other side of the wall.  There&#39;s a sign that says the shop is a gourmet sandwich shop and the food is made to order.  I&#39;ve been here a few times and tried the following:

CRABBY YOLA - $8 - &#34;Japanese style panko crusted homemade crab cake and baby greens topped with homemade creamy garlic basil aioli.&#34; This was pretty delicious.  The crab cakes had great texture (slightly crunchy on the outside) and flavors.  The sandwiches some with a pickle and a choice of a side.

ROI - $8 - &#34;Grilled chicken, lettuce, grilled onion and mushroom with wasabi infused teriyaki sauce and honey mustard.&#34;  I tried a bite of this and it was good.  Rarely am I in the mood for a chicken sandwich, so this is not something I would order.

Famous Remu - $8 - &#34;Grilled caramelized pork, shredded carrot and daiko, cucumber, red.&#34;  This one reminded me a lot of the Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi).  It was fresh and delicious.

SEASONED CHIPS - Kinda BBQish and some other flavors.  Pretty addicting.
PORK SESAME MISO SOUP - $2.50 - Pretty good, has characteristics similar to beef stew with a miso twist.

VEGETABLE TEMPURA -  I&#39;m not sure what kind of vegetables were deep fried, but it was good.  The sauce was on the sweet side, which I normally don&#39;t like, but it went very well with the vegetables.

CALAMARI STRIPS - $4 - This was good with the dipping sauce that came with it.  Crispy on the outside and not so chewy on the inside.

The service was fast and friendly!"

So order ahead.  Ordering online is sublime - great easy system.  Here&#39;s the good:  sandwiches  are very tasty. In fact, the first time I tried the Chicken Satay it was like to die for. I went back a week later and tried another sandwich, and while it too was so good, I thought the sauce tasted pretty much the same which disappointed me. Here&#39;s the not so good: their signature seasoned chips are not all that great because they seem a bit damp or something.  I have had them several times and would pass them up in a heartbeat. Next, $2 for a 12 ounce bottled water? WHAT? That is just wrong!  Kids meals - pass them up.  YUCK - they cut off the crust on WHITE BREAD and plop on chicken and some sauce which gets soaked up in the bread.  I wasted $9 on two kids sandwiches that came with soggy cold french fries. Never order the kids meals.  I thought they would be smaller versions of the full sized sandwiches but not true.  Finally, while the sandwiches are really overall really nice and tasty @ roughly $9 that is just too much to pay.  I would prefer to go up the street across from Mariano&#39;s and get real Thai take out for the same price."

The place is no frills, small (maybe 20 seats) and slightly pricey, but you are getting great quality and freshness here.  The homemade chips were really addictive and had a very tasty homemade seasoning (sugar and cinnamon were amongst the flavorings I tasted).  The aioli sauce on the sandwich was surprisingly a little runny but didn&#39;t really detract from anything.  I found about all the homemade stuff from chatting a little with Nate, the friendly Thai owner who started this business 5.5 years ago with his wife.   They just recently opened their second store in the city on Van Buren.  If you&#39;re looking for good Asian fusion sandwiches, I would highly recommend.

Great seasonings and sauces, great calamari although different from what you are used to. I have never had anything I haven&#39;t really enjoyed. Pretty cheap too."

You can really tell that he takes pride in his food, and is very hands on in all aspects of the restaurant. Very friendly.

We got the spicy shrimp sandwich and the korean beef sandwich. Both were $9. The korean beef was a little lackluster. Not bad at all, don&#39;t get me wrong, but imagine some beef stir fry between some bread, and you&#39;ve got your korean beef sandwich. 

The spicy shrimp sandwich was spectacular however. Have you ever had the bang bang shrimp at Bonefish? It kind of reminds me of that but better. You get some nice big shrimp and this zingy aioli that just sets it over the top. An absolute must have. 

All sandwiches come with a pickle spear and house made chips, which are fantastic. They put some sugar and spice on them, a very good touch.

Don&#39;t sleep on this place! Its great!"

I ordered the chicken satay and my husband had the tofu satay. We both enjoyed our sandwich very much - it was fresh and flavorful. I tried a bite of his sandwich and felt that mine had a better flavor overall, however. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the difference in how the spices and sauce get absorbed by the chicken vs the tofu or what. He agreed mine tasted better as well.

The pickle spear was fresh and the homemade seasoned chips were definitely different than just regular chips. I tasted a hint of cinnamon and sweet potato in them.

Since this place is so small and busy we took our meal to nearby Wilder Park and had a little picnic lunch. I highly recommend doing this on a nice day.

But on Friday night, my wife was hanging out with some friends in the western suburbs.  So on Saturday around lunchtime I was planning to meet up with them for lunch.  I suggested somewhere in Elmhurst as it was close enough between our houses.  The first place we looked into was closed so I suggested Zenwich.

When we got there I was surprised it was a little store front in a strip mall.  But I wasn&#39;t going to judge that.  So we enter the restaurant and look at the menu.  It was really hard to come to a decision/conclusion on what we would order.  After spending a few minutes it seemed like my wife and I were going to split two sandwiches.  We did the Korean cheese steak and some braised pork sandwich.

The Korean cheese steak was amazing.  There really is no easy way to describe it (it tastes like bulgogi and a cheese steak at the same time).  Just get it"

Order the Italian sub and you&#39;ll immediately notice the cuts of meat are strategically folded offering a nucleus of dense compaction That&#39;s a visual ploy, or if anything, just try to chew that mass of confusion.

Speaking of confusion...the &#34;Bread&#39; is soft and fluffy. That would be spot on if served on a New Orleans Beef or Shrimp Po&#39; Boy! Not Here! The soft bread has no substance at all. The &#34;Brick&#34; of meat gets continually squeezed with every bite and eventually compressed as a projectile in any direction you desire!

Everything about a deli should be upfront and in your face. Not here...your sandwich is prepared behind a secret wall. That&#39;s a visual screw up for a self proclaimed deli.

Ordering at Mario&#39;s really tests your patience.  From the time you order until the time it actually makes it into the bag, your life flashes before your eyes... I remembered when I first learned to ride a 2-wheel bike; I remembered learning to drive a stick shift; I remembered slamming my first can of Old Style Beer; I remembered walking in the door over 20 minutes ago!

The fact that your written order is handed off to someone hiding behind a wall to prepare it &#34;secretly&#34; is disappointing and frankly annoying.

Mario&#39;s employees walk around casually with smiles on their faces as they fill lunch time catering orders while you do a slow burn...waiting for your sandwich."

Their macaroni salad is made with the pasta shape that I think is called dialetti  (?) And has some corn, green peas, and a little red onion or shallots in it and it is good. I&#39;ve had it on both visits and will make it my regular side.
The sandwiches are also very good. Nice bread, fresh ingredients and they don&#39;t skimp on them either. Very solid sandwiches. I am looking forward to trying other ones here.

You&#39;ll find it in the strip mall below a condo building near the Bensenville train station.

My favorite is the Joey sub.

They recently added a members club through your email which can provide discounts. Wednesdays in the summer are packed for Bensenville&#39;s &#34;Music In the Park&#34;, so you won&#39;t find parking for blocks. 

Come grab a sub and enjoy the festivals."

Love the new pulled pork with coleslaw (you can order it without the bun). So delicious! Staff is friendly and genuinely likes to get to know their customers. So, if you&#39;re an impatient person who dislikes small talk - not sure if you will enjoy Mario&#39;s Deli. You can probably pre-order your sub and then just pick it up if you are in a hurry to get your sandwich made and handed off to you. Mario&#39;s has a booth at Music in the Park every Wednesday night in Bensenville (thru August) - so be sure to check them out there also! They&#39;re open until 7pm most evenings! Love this place and its rare to have owners who actually seem to genuinely care about you as a person. You&#39;re not just a number at Mario&#39;s!"

We usually stick with our favorites which are:

*Meat Lasagna
*Cheese Lasagna
These trays are HUGE and heavy and just awesome.  He gives a ton of food and its really good.

*Meatballs
Everyone goes nuts for these.  MUST try!

*Italian Beef
The beef has a definitive spice in it that makes it really yummy.

I will have to go in there for lunch one day and order just an individual meal as we always just cater from here but Im sure its just as good!"

Also, I have not had better gnocchi than the gnocchi at Mario&#39;s Deli II.  That alone is worth the drive.  

The subs come in to different sizes 6&#34; and 10&#34; with plenty of meat and cheese to satisfy even the hungriest of appetites.  The pastas and sides are all excellent and you get a good amount of food for your money!

Anything to move faster would of been nice. She had zero customer service skills. After all the nonsense we went through, Alex made everything great.

I took my plate to the front where we ordered and the manager apologized a few times and remade our entire order. She also gave us two gift cards to return. There&#39;s no way I would ever go back there. Absolutely disgusting.

This was the worst experience I have had. I am very familiar with what the taste and consistency of their sauces should be, so you can imagine my surprise when I requested a 20 piece, boneless, hot and got a batch of grease-laden disgustingness. I have attached a picture of the grease (I removed the wings and literally patted them down with paper towel, they were so saturated) to prove my point. The sauce was flavorless and awful. The wings themselves appeared to have been incorrectly prepared as well, having a color so bright in redness it matched nothing I had previously seen from Wingstop or any other wing joint. To make matters worse, Im guessing the gentleman in the back that prepared them is the owner.

We took the food to go, but once we get home, the second order is still wrong! Entire order of food was cold and hardly had any flavor due to lack of sauce. I understand being understaffed as I stated I am a manager of a few retail salons and know the pressure of being busy, but treat your PAYING customers correctly. A simple apology and correcting my order would have helped alter my review on this location, but after calling to speak with a manager when I got home to be told &#34;THE FOOD IS HOT AND YOUR ORDER IS CORRECT&#34; from a &#34;manager&#34; when it clearly wasn&#39;t(read previous reviews-obv. I&#39;m not the only one) is just awful management. This location lacks everything needed in order to run a successful business. Do your self a favor and drive to the location on lake street in the Hanover park/Roselle area, SO much better!"

This was the first time at this new location.  Stopped in at 5:00 pm with one person in front of me.  Ordered 6 wings and fries.  The cashier told me it would be about 9-10 minutes.  At 5:24 my wings were finally ready.  Definitely not worth the wait.  The worst wings I have ever had.  Basically overcooked and hardly any sauce - basically if I had not purchased an extra cup of sauce for $0.89 there would have been no sauce at all on them.  And on top of it the wings are probably the smallest I have ever seen.  I will never go to this location again.

I can&#39;t speak for the restaurant itself, as I sent the husbo out into the cold to fetch our meal.  He&#39;s not a man of many words when it comes to things like decor, ambiance, etc.

The husbo did comment on how nice staff was. They gave him a free pop for whatever reason. He didn&#39;t have to wait long for the carry out order.  

We had been wanting to try their $1 pork or chicken tacos, so we got 5 of each. They did mine and the husbo&#39;s auténtico (onions and cilantro) and gringo (lettuce, cheese, tomato) for the tween.  We also got an order of chips and salsa.  

Both meats were good, the seasoning was not overpowering. I was able to give the miniature some chicken without worring what I would deal with on the diaper end.  The flour tortillas were fresh and thick.  

The chips were good but a little greasy.  The salsas, picosas!!  The tomatillo was probably the spiciest.  

Everything was of good quality and freshness, especially considering the cost. You&#39;re spending $1 for a taco!  These ingrediants are fresher than anything you&#39;d find on a fast food dollar menu. 

A $13 meal for a family of 3.5 is not a bad deal.  We can&#39;t wait to dine-in and try more stuff on the menu...which we will probably do soon, as mi cocina está cerrada most of the time. 

Check it out, keep the place open!!"

Right off the bat the place was in great shape. You could tell that they were just setting up but for the most part the place was well put together. Well anyways my husband and I had some Delicious chips and homemade salsa really good. It was one of those homemade salsas where the spicy of the salsa doesn&#39;t kick in until later. So well after we got our Mexican cokes and decided on what to eat my husband and I decided we both would try the burrito dinner with steak. OMG it was really,really good. The only thing my husband said was they didn&#39;t really give you a lot of rice and beans and I said well hon did you see the burrito...it&#39;s not small. :) And honestly people in my opinion they give you just the right amount of everything and it does fill you up and it&#39;s not expensive at all. And also they are  going to have a karaoke. So for those people who love great Authentic Mexican Food this place is for  you."

I was not disappointed i ordered a medium thin crust pizza with sausage and ricotta and some cannolis. We ordered delivery, the man on the phone said it would take an hour and the pizza arrived before that, not bad for 9pm on a Saturday. The delivery man was so nice, made small talk and was very polite.  

I think i found my new pizza spot. Our pizza arrived warm. The crust was perfectly crisp, the pizza had the right amount of cheese and sauce. Our cannolis were the perfect ending to our meal. 

Maybe next time ill try double dough and review that."

I don&#39;t know what it is about having a baby, but we have been getting food delivered more than we used to.  And its not like she is a newborn or anything, I think its just pure laziness on our part.... Anywho, not the point.

Ordered a basic Sausage thin crust and we devoured it.  Loved the sauce, loved the crust, and the sausage was amazing, tasted super fresh and packed a ton of flavor.  With the delivery charge and tip it was more than I would like to spend on a regular occasion, but it was worth it.

Next time, we are going for the pan pizza :)  Wish us luck."

At the first time I asked him he was in the car and was able to move easily, but instead he left the car and went to make the delivery and after couple of minutes of waiting I went inside the building to ask him again, his respond was wait, nothing will happen to you. But the main thing happen when he came outside, he starts yelling at me and of course he did use all the bad words he knew (and I am a 26 year old woman).

They make their own sausage which is delicious, but I never get to have it because my entire family is full of mutants who hate sausage (hate America while you&#39;re at it family).  The pepperoni is very good too though.  Since I&#39;m weird too I always get the pizza bread with the pizza which I love.

The pizza&#39;s are not made like your loumalnatis or giordano&#39;s where the cheese is on bottom and sauce on top. They actually do the reverse where the cheese stays on top, which doesn&#39;t bother me. The pizza was a decent price for a stuffed 12&#34; pizza. 17 bucks I believe for it.

As far as I am concerned for a thin crust pizza there is zero reason to ever call anyone other than V&amp;V. The sausage is homemade and the sauce is awesome. The topping are always flavorful and thus must be fresh. There are a few things to know..which as far as I&#39;m concerned do not affect the review.

From time to time orders will disappear...not that often but it does happen...I think what happens is that they tell you they will have a pizza to you in an hour when the wait time is actually 2 hours. You heard it right... Friday and Saturday nights can be on a 2 hour wait...delivery or pickup doesn&#39;t matter. So Plan ahead!"

V&amp;V has a nice sturdy crust that didn&#39;t flop over when he ate it. The sausage was good, but a little scarce. The sauce had a nice flavor and consistency.  It was a little greasier than we would have liked, but it was still delicious. I tried the chicken vesuvio (boneless) for our first carryout order and it was surprisingly nice for a meal that arrived in a plastic container rather than being eaten in an Italian restaurant somewhere. There were two decent sized chicken breasts and about six large potato wedges. The potatoes were cooked just right. Not mushy or underdone. I was pleasantly surprised. We also tried the onion rings and mozzarella sticks. Both are frozen and then fried. Typical and not homemade. $9.95 for 12 mozzarella sticks led me to believe they were going to be something special. It&#39;s my fault for not asking first though. 

A couple things to note...  It&#39;s very loud when you call to place your order. They can barely hear you, so make sure they repeat the order (and credit card number if you gave it) back to you. Also, the reviews that indicate it&#39;s a little pricy for what it is are right. We will not be frequent customers, but for a nice pan pizza less than five minutes from home, we will be back."

If you have grown tired of V &amp; V&#39;s thin crust pizza and outstanding homemade sausage after ordering it at least once a week for the last five or ten years -- which, admittedly, is highly unlikely because it is so unbelievably good -- then I would recommend experimenting with some of their other crust options.

I&#39;m always down for a slice!!  So we waited until the &#34;thin crust&#34; mood struck, and it brough our appetites to the likes of V&amp;V!

It was snowing out.  Badly.  Like the first snowfall of the year where people forget how to drive. By the way, in case you were wondering, it goes like this: ease on the gas, ease off the gas and brake slowly and steer, Jeebus...it&#39;s not rocket science, guys.

That being said, we were fully ready to pick up our pizza, but we found out that they deliver to our area!  *fist pump* YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!

BTW, they missed out on seeing me in my VS PINK sweatpants, but that&#39;s their loss...

But now onto the most important part of the part of the review...ME!  And what *I* thought about the food ;)

It was delightful!!!  So here&#39;s the rundown of what we got:
A thin crust SAH-SAGE well done with extra sauce 
Dinner Salad w/ Ranch
Garlic Bread
Chocolate Cake

And our total was $23 and some change.  $33 if you include what we gave the driver for foraging through the snow to give us our noms.  It&#39;s over a 40% tip, but it was well-deserved!

OK, so onto the somewhat bad (and it&#39;s not even that bad).  The salad was $2.95 and all it was was some chopped up iceburg lettuce and two sad little slices of tomato.  I wouldn&#39;t order it again for that price.  it wasn&#39;t worth it for the size and quality.  The garlic bread was pretty good, but standard.

But the pizza and the cake--WOW!  They were my shining stars of the meal!  Everyone who raved about the sausage was absolutely correct.  They know what they&#39;re doing here!  And I liked that I ordered my pizza well done, and it ACTUALLY CAME WELL DONE!  Shocker and a half right there!!  I don&#39;t know what the pizza would be like with regular sauce, since we ordered ours with extra, but it was a great amount.  And the sauce is very sweet.

And double wow for the chocolate cake.  Yummy, gooey, delicious, and everything I want in my dessert :)

I know this is going to be one of our go-to places from now on for delicious thin crust and great service!!"

I wish they were open on Mondays

Update 11/17/13

Their simple fare such as the Italian Beef Sandwich and Their Grilled Chicken Pesto is wonderful. 
The Cheesecake is good hearty slice, enough for two.
My sinful order includes the fried mushrooms and a thin crust saus, mush, gp and onion.

Update 11/18/13

Ordered fried mushroom appetizer, its the traditional fried mushrooms that are sold in wholesale packs to restaurants, but still good.

BBQ chicken wings are also traditional, and they use Open Pit BBQ sauce which has 

Caprese Salad,(  had fresh mozzarella,roasted peppers, tomatoes and seeded black olives.)

Thin Crust , black olive and onion .

Order arrived hot. Polite delivery."

For all those bad reviews out there wow... are you sure you ate at V&amp;V?  Frozen pizza crust?  A pizza from the grocery store? Are you kidding me?  This place is so good.  From the crust to the cheese and everything in between.  I order mine well done and it reminds me of my childhood and eating pizza in Chicago.  I have tried several places in the West Burbs and this is my favorite Mom and Pop Pizza joint.  Love it!

If I had a con it would be that it is only a take out place.  But this place is always good.  We moved out of their delivery area and we still make a trip to get our pizza from here.  Love it! Love it! Love it!  

p.s. when we have ordered for a party everyone is always surprised as they are coming from the city and always give compliments to how good the pizza is.  Before we discovered V&amp;V we would get pizza from another place for parties and never got a compliment.  Same group of people and no they weren&#39;t just hungry.  Its just good.  So I think it boils down to people have different tastes but give it a shot.  Try a small see how you like it and you may just discover your new favorite pizza place.  I did. So happy I did."

There is one trick though and I dont like mentioning all the secrets to the trade.  :)  Well........I cant, maybe later!  haha...Anyways, the pizza is great here.  They do not use cheap ingreds or even on top of it they do not skimp on anything either.  Pizzas are PHENOM!  Other menu items are great as well!  I would recommend if not the pizza to go w/ their manicotti.  It comes piping hot, baked w/ a nice mound of nicely melted mozzarella on top of  their homemade cheese manicotti.  This is there Sunday special and its be known &#34;by me&#34;  :) to cure any type of hangover possible.  So H or H (hungry or hungover)  you like that I just made it up myself!  haha...Manicotti is great.  Back to the #1 item here.   Fresh ingredients, great sauce, good cheese (not cheap stuff).

I have good memories of the chili mac supreme. Haven&#39;t had it in a few years, but I stopped in here today. I asked for, and was charged for, double beef. When it came out I looked at it and thought, &#34;um, I said double beef, not half beef.&#34; I told my server and she took the plate back to the kitchen. She came back and told me that they said this IS double beef. ??? It&#39;s almost nonexistent. They charge an extra dollar for as much beef as about a quarter of one of their little burger patties? She looked sorry and said she&#39;d ask if they could put more on, and I said thanks, and she did. And they did put more on. But, um... gosh. Disappointing. She had to see me sitting here taking pictures of this plate and she knew I wasn&#39;t happy, but the poor kid still came back to ask if everything tasted okay. I bet she was dreading coming back to my table. Totally not her fault, though.

In better news, my turtle shake was good. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come back here though."

If you&#39;re looking for a great place to get something quick and fill that comfort food void then don&#39;t think twice, stop in and enjoy a jalapeno crunch burger with a really big iced tea. It&#39;s my favorite and will keep me coming for years to come.

We wanted a little something better than fast food but not the lengthy time of a sit down.  This seemed to be a good compromise.  It&#39;s been a couple of years since our last visit to a steak and shake. 

First off, let me start off with why a drive thru.  These burgers are made to order, not a production mode like McDonalds or BK. Your not going to get quick service in a drive thru in a place like this. Just not going to happen. Which leads to my complaint about slow service. Drive thru gets priority and bogs down the sit down portion of the business. 

Now for the food...pleasantly surprised!  We all ordered melts and they were very good. Much better choice than McD and BK. The price was right in line too. The reason we haven&#39;t been to SnS because we thought it was a pricy burger. With today&#39;s places like 5 Guys and pricy burgers,  it&#39;s nice to see SnS staying in line with a realistic burger price.  

We will be back, but make sure we know what to order right away to save time."

The food is greasy and good, prices are super cheap, service was super friendly, not too far from work...all in all a good experience.

They have a bunch of lunchtime options for $4 which is awesome~! I had the Portabello and Swiss Hamburger meal which came with fries which I got cheesy and covered in bacon. See picture. Nomz. Now this was a one time heart attack paired with a double chocolate milkshake but man was it all good! It was a big amount of food, too, so had to take fries and half the burger home!

Pro Tip: If you&#39;re going to get a milkshake, opt for the regular size. I got a small and my friend got a large. His was at least double the size of mine for like 50 cents more!"

I came in with my 3yr old expecting to wait, but not expecting to be ignored. Three servers walked passed me completely ignoring me standing there with my son waiting to be seated. They saw me, and even though semi-occupied, (like bringing silverware to someone) they didn&#39;t even acknowledge me. I dress decently, I don&#39;t look like a hobo, I try to smile and my cute son is hard to miss. Why would you ignore me and look for ways to stay occupied to avoid seating me??

So the manager comes and helps me out finally. We seat and for another 10 minutes the same treatment! One waiter literally walked by, sees me ready to order, and goes to the table behind me to ask how everyone is doing then leaves. I stood up and vocally told the waiter to get the manager. Another waiter came to me immediately and I reprimanded her on how completely disrespectful it is to be ignored.

Its one thing to be busy, thats understood. Another to be completely IGNORED!!!

She said the meal is completely free, anything free...Ok...Then she properly apologized. Ok, deep breath, I&#39;m cool...Forgiven.

THEN THE MEAL COMES OUT, there&#39;s hair in my boy&#39;s plate. YGTBFKM. I held the plate in the air and motioned to the waiter to come look. Wow. She was as shocked as I was and says, &#34;When it rains, it pours.&#34; Then goes back in the kitchen and yells at everyone about what happened. That made me feel better.

The manager was urgent at making sure this was reconciled, came out to me and got down to my eye level and genuinely apologized. &#34;Its normally not like this&#34;. She is right. It isn&#39;t. &#34;Please take home whatever you like, order more, everything is on me.&#34; She and the waiter both encouraged me to order extra.

I don&#39;t know, the waiter and manager both were genuine in their apology and handled it well enough for me to not completely write this place off. I may give it another try. Just not at peak time!!  - Nicholas  visited: 11/09/2013, 6:15pm"

First of all the service was quite terrible. Very slow and we waited a good 15 minutes for our check. We went to the counter finally to pay our bill and we had to wait since no body was at the register. We hand the lady in a gray shirt and headphones our 100 dollar bill. It was one of the older looking bills. She gets her counterfeit marker and marks our bill. The mark on it turns yellow and she then holds it up to the light. She then tells us that our bill is fake. We are shocked at this. She holds up a newer bill and tells us that our bill doesn&#39;t have the blue stripe. Now she&#39;s comparing two different bills. Me and my family work in the resturant business and we use the same marker to mark our bills. If the mark turns yellow then the bill is real. If the mark turns brown or black then the bill is fake. Maybe she should read the instructions about the marker and she will do it right. She tells us to take our bill back to the bank because it was fake, we were embarrassed so we hand her a different bill. Now if her logic is to compare the old bill with the newer bill then use the marker wrong then she needs to learn how to handle money the right way. After our experience we took the bill to the bank and it was accepted with no problem. Never trust the lady in gray with the headphones."

We came here on a Tuesday around 12:30 to eat lunch (an 8th grade &#34;treat&#34; on a band tour). The food got to our table fairly quickly, but almost no one got exactly what they ordered! Now onto the real problem at hand, I had ordered their spicy chipotle grilled chicken sandwich and it came to the table with chili cheese fries I had neither ordered nor could eat. I alerted the waitress and she moved them off the plate. I go to take a bite of the sandwich and I see none other than melted cheese on the sandwich. I again called the waiter over (took several calls from all 10 of us at the table to get her back toward us) and alerted her to the fact that I am allergic to dairy. She takes a look at it and says &#34;Oh honey that&#39;s not cheese, it&#39;s just &#34;stuff from the grill&#34;. Now i&#39;m thinking &#34;What is &#39;stuff from the grill&#34;?! She then STUCK HER FINGERS IN MY SANDWICH and pulled off some of that mysterious cheese-like substance, and looked at me, expecting me to eat it. I did, against my better judgement. There was indeed cheese on it. I then had an allergic reaction. $9.70 I payed for that meal...

In summary, if you&#39;re going to  pay $9.70 for a burger, perhaps you should go to Meatheads. You&#39;ll get less &#34;stuff from the grill&#34;."

Since I was in a college and visiting Illinois, I&#39;ve tried to make a point to visit Steak N&#39; Shakes when the opportunity arises because of the quality experiences I&#39;ve had.  This visit was even better, and exceeded the expectations I have had for the past 10 years.  The folks at Steak N&#39; Shake have done something exceptionally brilliant, they&#39;ve lowered their prices.  It&#39;s the same delicious hamburger(s) and specialty sandwiches and fries at a lower price than I recall paying before.  Combo meals were between $3.79 and $5.79.  It appears to me that Steak N&#39; Shake is going after the jugular of mediocre burger chains by delivering a superior product at a better price.  The 3 of us in our party were stuffed, and raving about the experience at $21.09.  How often can you say that these days?

This location in particular was very clean and well maintained, and it had a sit-down feel at lower than walk-up prices.  The manager also made a point to visit our table to make sure our needs were being met.

Not only that, the coffee was so good I think I drank a pot by myself.

We went for breakfast so I can&#39;t comment on what lunch is like but the omelettes my husband and I had were fluffy and full of flavor!  I had one that was stuffed with chorizo, jalapeno, cheese, &amp; green pepper; my husband&#39;s was the meat lover.  I didn&#39;t taste his because, well, he never offered because it was so good and to be fair, mine was so good I didn&#39;t offer a taste of mine either.  And the pancakes!  Moist, light, fluffy... YUM!  I was recently at another area restaurant for pancakes and they were as dry and tasteless as the Sierra.

The servers were very attentive with refills and we never had to flag someone down to refill our cup.  That&#39;s one of my pet peeves.  Nothing&#39;s worse than sitting there with your food getting cold because you&#39;re waiting for a drink to wash it down with.  Also they were very good at honoring my swap-outs.

I started with the seaweed soup which was delicious and only a dollar, so there is no reason you shouldn&#39;t try it.  We then ordered the vegetable tempura for an appetizer. It was much bigger than we expected for $5.50. I was pretty much full after that, but we had 4 rolls on the way. All the rolls we ordered came with 8 pieces.

What a disappointment! The chicken was tasteless and that special sauce doesn&#39;t really add too much. Their rice was tasty and those sweet carrots were really good!  I guess if I were a vegetarian, I wouldn&#39;t mind it. But I&#39;m a meatatarian ! Now what?

I guess it&#39;s not fair to give this review since I only tried 1 thing off the menu but I really doubt that I&#39;ll be back to try again."

Service was fantastic! Combo platters and sushi were great. They even had sweet iced tea, which is a plus! 

I ordered the soba noodles with steak. I asked for the steak to be prepared at a medium temp, but many pieces were well done. I also tried the red dragon,  jasmine, and Hollywood rolls. Everything was delicious!

Everything was fresh, except the wasabi. It was dark and didn&#39;t look appetizing at all, so I didn&#39;t eat it. That was really the only negative. 

Price point, quality, and service were all spot on."

This used to be a Burger King, and it shows; they changed the wallpaper and lights, but left the tiles and front counter. So I walked in with my daughter expecting to buy something at the counter and take it to a table, but instead we were sat down and served.

I have no idea what the drive thru is being used for right now.

Weird vibes aside, I got a flounder plate, and a kids&#39; shrimp plate. The flounder was excellent; a very crispy exterior around flaky white fish, while the shrimp was cooked properly. Both had good taste, and were served with flavored rice, practically candied carrots and broccoli.

Plates come with a spicy (but not hot) mayo sauce that&#39;s best used sparingly.

Lunch ended up being about 3 meals for $20, tip included. Not bad!"

Maybe the greatest impact was the experience of wonderful food juxtaposed with &#39;fast food architecture&#39;...when this place is anything but fast food.

Easy, it is in an old Burger King when I am used to Japanese restaurants being in shopping centers or something more authentic looking. Also, the prices! Yeah, seeing rolls for $5, a large Sashimi plate for $20, scared me. So, going in &amp; thinking this was going to be a bad experience all around, I was quickly surprised by the quality of the sushi I got for the price. Volcano Roll, oh my delicious. Granted, I have had better, however for not $10 or $11. Spicy Tuna Roll, pretty darn good. Once again, I have had better, but not for $5/$6. In the area, I prefer their spicy tuna over the competitors because they do it old school &amp; don&#39;t use a spicy tuna paste, they use a nice piece of tuna with a wasabi ball on the inside.

I have had better, so why 5 stars? A few reasons. 1) the price is really good &amp; they have food pretty much your entire family will enjoy. Habachi style food is there as well, and crazy cheap, like a full meal for $7/$8. 2) the flavor &amp; quality of the sushi. It might be priced like Jewel Sushi but it definitely doesn&#39;t taste like Jewel Sushi, pretty darn good and the bang for the buck is good here. 3) the staff is very friendly. After talking to the owner, or one of the owners, it became apparent to me that people think like I did before I went in there, however others don&#39;t give the place a chance. Seriously, if you have been considering a decent local place or want to be introduced to a Japanese cuisine, then you really should try this place out. I can say it has been almost 24 hours since I ate there &amp; had not a single negative effect, so that is a plus :D

I will definitely go back and if my experience changes at all, I will update this. Oh, one negative...their chopsticks! They are the ones that are already separated and are round &amp; really slick. I prefer the ones you break apart and are more square. Of course, personal preference, but just a heads up ;)

UPDATE: 10/25/2016 - almost a year later &amp; I still love this place! I have yet to be disappointed there, and visit a few times months, and some times a few times a week."

I was expecting a quickly prepared hibachi style meal (by hibachi, I thought high temperature grill cooked like Benihana&#39;s) at a reasonable price.  What we experienced was more like mall court food served by a wait staff. 

It was mid afternoon on Sunday and there was nobody else in the restaurant.  I would soon find out why. My wife had the Teriyaki chicken and I ordered the Hibachi chicken.  The meal was served on  a small oval dish and was not very appealing visually.  One chicken came with mushrooms the other with broccoli. Both had a side of carrot slices. We both found our chicken to be dry and bland.  The only seasoning to stand out was the salt. The carrots were sweet and very soft.  Tasted as if they just came out of a can and were mixed with honey. Very unremarkable.  My wife was not happy with her white rice but I thought it appeared like any other fast food Asian rice. The broccoli was tough. My meal came with fried rice and it was the most unappealing and bland fried rice I have ever tasted.  We did not finish our meal and left the restaurant feeling ripped off and hungry.  

I have to say though that the gentleman who waited on us was very pleasant and professional. 

So if you like bland tasting dry chicken with a kick of salt then this place is for you but as for me I will not venture back. I will stick with Joy Teriyaki!"

From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by our server who seemed nice and professional.  Her friendliness was just enough and not over the top.  Because it wasn&#39;t busy and still early in the day, we had a choice of a booth or a table.  I thought that was really nice.  

Our host/server was very attentive and constantly asked us if we were ready.  If I was to give her advise, it would be to ask us if we have been there before so that she can give feedback on what most patrons found to be very good on the menu.  For first timers, it&#39;s always good to give suggestions on what is good or ask what we were in the mood for.  Plus it shows that she knows her menu.  If anything, I hope the owners highly encourage her to try the food so that she has more knowledge on what the food taste like.  Otherwise, she was friendly and attentive.  

I ordered the Dragon Roll and that was just perfect.  It may not seem like it was enough but it definitely hit the spot.  I think I found my favorite sushi.  I also ordered the house salad with the shrimp dressing.  I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect but the dressing was good.  However, it did have a taste of Thousand Island.  Maybe it&#39;s just another version of Thousand Island?  My fiancé ordered the Soba Noodles and he loved it.  He&#39;s typically weary of stir fry foods as for some reason he feels that it&#39;s just too bland and not enough flavor to them.  However, he really enjoyed the food here.  I also was able to try it and I thought the balance in flavors was just right.  The seasoning wasn&#39;t overpowering and it definitely was not bland.  I didn&#39;t feel the need to put any soy sauce to his dish.  

Thank you for a great meal and wonderful service.  We would definitely want to come back here again.  Good luck, Tokyo Grill.  We sincerely hope the best for your restaurant.  :)"

Lots of parking is available in their private lot.

The decor reminds me of a fast food place, which is probably what it was before. I personally didn&#39;t care, but some people might be turned off. &#34;Stark&#34; would be the word that I would use to describe it?

The sushi rolls we ordered were tasty and well presented, on the other hand, the entrees have a monochromatic gray-ish look to them with the exception of the carrots which added some color. I ordered the seaweed soup- it was OK but seemed on the bland side.

I wish that they would have left a pot of tea on the table rather than having to call the waitress each time we wanted a refill. The teacups were slightly on the small side too.

We were at Tokyo Grill for around 2 hours and NO ONE other than ourselves and the waitstaff were in the dining area for that entire length of time.

I was surprised that they brought us fortune cookies with our check- isn&#39;t that Chinese?"

I like to see places like this succeed as it is an alternative to the typical burger/sandwich fare that is in the area.  I had the soba noodles with chicken and a soft drink.  It was oily... as in so oily I was wiping my lips over and over driving down the street after I left.  The portions are not huge but adequate for a lunch.  Still, my total reached $12 and I had to leave a tip so it went to $15 and it is just not worth it in my opinion.

I usually get the &#34;Imprial&#34; combo dinner. It&#39;s hibachi steak, chicken, and shrimp with a mushroom/broccoli mix, fried rice, and boiled carrots. Though it&#39;s one of the more expensive meals, the portion is very generous; at least 2 meals.

The only downside to this place is the boiled carrots. They are too sweet and boiled to death and super soft.  They give you a ton with practically every meal, so I started replacing the carrots with more mushroom/broccoli mix (but you can sub any side). The mushrooms and broccoli are amazing, very delicious and cooked perfectly, but the fried rice could use some more flavor.

Finally, the food is ready extremely quickly and the service is great. Definitely a great place to have for a quick hibachi meal."

Eggrolls- average. tempura dish- the tempura was very heavy, like beer batter, not light with panko as I have experienced in other Japanese restaurants. Combo chicken and scallop dish was nothing special. The chicken was overdone, scallops fine. Veggies- boiled sweet carrots and broccoli somewhat overcooked. Fried rice- nothing special. &#34;Special sauce&#34; didn&#39;t really matter. (best sauce was the teriyaki for the tempura) Would rather have spent a little more and gone to another place for sushi.

I thought the value was very good in proportion to the food you receive.

We had all sushi the night we went.. about 8 rolls in total.  I tasted their seaweed soup, I enjoyed it.  All rolls were very tasty and made to order.  Be prepared to wait awhile, as they take time to make and I think only one, maybe two people were making them.  I did not mind the wait at all, just a FYI for you.   My only gripe is a lot of the rolls had the same &#39;spicy&#39; mayonnaise on them.  The &#39;spicy&#39; rolls were not very spicy, but maybe you could ask for it more spicy??  Management - do not water down any authenticity of your dishes if you think catering to sensitive tongues is better!!!  Make spicy... SPICY!

The wait staff was very friendly and I can tell they are still getting their feet wet a bit, which is not a problem at all.  

I really hope this restaurant does well in Roselle.  There are not a lot of sushi restaurants in the area and being off of Lake St. is a big plus.  It is very easy to access and leave.  The light they are off of is never busy.  I hope the population supports them here."

I&#39;ve been here twice now; once carry-out, and once through the drive-thru. It&#39;s close to my house, and I love the idea of being able to grab a quick Japanese bite on the way home when I&#39;m exhausted and don&#39;t feel like cooking. 

But it&#39;s left me underwhelmed both times. For one, it&#39;s about as authentic as Benihana (which is to say, not very). For two, holy salt lick, Batman! 

No TL;DR-ness tonight, I&#39;m afraid. I&#39;ll simply unpack these two experiences with some star points:

Plus column: 

* The people working here are nice, if a little frazzled. 
* Proteins were prepared well, both times. First time there, I had teriyaki chicken and my SO had hibachi steak (without the sauce, since he&#39;s gluten intolerant and their glaze uses soy sauce). I also had an eel roll. Second time there, I had salmon. All those proteins were good.

Minus column:

* The fried rice that comes with every entree is pretty meh unless you dump the &#34;shrimp sauce&#34; that also comes with every entree over it. It&#39;s not good-quality rice, and the seasoning is meh. 
* The &#34;sweet carrots&#34; that come with every entree are simultaneously cooked to death and WAY too sweet. Just tossed those both times I ordered here, and I hate wasting food. Still, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to eat them because the threat of cavities from all that sugar wouldn&#39;t have been worth it.
* The sauce on the teriyaki chicken I had the first time was apparently very liquid, and didn&#39;t stick to the chicken at all. I know this because the chicken was flavorful and well-seasoned, but the rice (which was under it, and which sopped up all the sauce as it dripped off the chicken) was basically an inedible salt lick. Since my SO had the hibachi steak with no sauce, I was able to taste his rice and determine that it was probably my sauce that made my rice inedible. His rice was just bland, but with the aforementioned addition of the shrimp sauce, was made merely OK.

*****************************************

If you have two sides that come with ALL your entrees, they should really be good, wouldn&#39;t you think? Since the people working here seem really nice, and also like this might be their first time running a restaurant, I wanted to give them another chance. Everyone can have an off day. That&#39;s why I waited until I&#39;d been here twice to write this review. I want to give people the benefit of the doubt because I&#39;ve worked in this industry for awhile, and I know that ups and downs happen. 

But it&#39;s just not good. It&#39;s inexpensive, definitely, but since I often cook at home, and don&#39;t depend on take-out for the majority of my foods, I&#39;ll probably spend a couple more bucks and go elsewhere when I&#39;m in the mood.

There&#39;s much better legit (and even better Americanized) Japanese food to be had out there. Sorry, guys."

I&#39;m surprised the trend reviews don&#39;t reflect the drop in service and traffic we have recently experienced, and it had been falling off before. The trend charts show a stalling 3 but of course it&#39;s 3 1/2 stars for some reason. Falling 3 at best.

We&#39;ve been here many times and find lunch below average so we only do dinners off the Chinese menu. If you come here at 8pm (open till 9) the place is completely empty on a weeknight. Somehow we managed to also get the worst service we&#39;ve ever had. The server kept trying to rush our order so she could go eat her meal with the staff and stare at videos largely ignoring us.

So we started out with a pot of lukewarm tea, and when we later asked if they had any hot tea she essentially said she would have to make some. I&#39;m not going to beg, I&#39;m just not coming back, and I guarantee that she could care less and probably wasn&#39;t surprised at a less than stellar tip. I can&#39;t justify rewarding or encouraging that terrible service.

Song Fish Soup appetizer always good, this time we got it with about a bonus 1.5 x 1.5  inch clump of undissolved rice starch. Still tasty. Stir fried green beans good and the spicy cumin lamb not spicy at all, chilis not blackened or even toasted looked like, pretty sure they just threw them in at the end but at least it wasn&#39;t over salted. I got some chili oil and boosted it.
I shouldn&#39;t have to.

I&#39;ll be amazed if this place is open in 6 months. Beware. 
And if all that wasn&#39;t bad enough they&#39;ve dropped their very reasonable wine and beer service.
This was where I would send people instead of the very below average non alcohol Jaded Thai another ugly strip corner over.
Can&#39;t recommend it anymore. 
The chinese dinner menu IS good if you want to be ignored in an empty restaurant, and rice starch clumps aren&#39;t going to kill you. Kind of play doh in a sinking chinese restaurant on the far NW edge of a shrinking Schaumburg. And Chili Oil cures a lot if not over salted, but screw that, YOU can do better.
We&#39;re not coming back. Yu&#39;s in Schaumburg does a better cumin lamb now.
We will miss the SongFishSoup, but easy enuf to find in the city. 
We&#39;ve met the owners kids and like them, too bad. RIP"

So this place is located in a strip mall, near the center corner. The waitress gave us two menus. The &#34;normal&#34; menu with your Americanized dishes, and another menu, that literally has the title &#34;Authentic Chinese&#34; food menu.

I went with my white-boy side, and ordered the Mongolian chicken, light sauce, and it was pretty good. It came on them fancy deep-fried Singapore noodles. I remember when my Dad had his Chinese restaurant, I would love watching him make those noodles. Anyways, chicken was delicious, I&#39;d estimate about 6-oz worth of protein on that plate. Note, unlike Mongolian chicken/beef that I&#39;ve had in the past, this dish was not overly consumed with green onions, but there were plenty of white onions on it. Very tasty for me.

Service and staff were OK. I&#39;ll need to come back here to try out there Authentic Chinese food menu"

Ordered the beef chow fun, it was pretty good, nice flavors on the rice noodle and the beef was succulent and tender enough. A bit greasy though but so are most beef chow funs at other places.
The other party in my group ordered walnut shrimp. The shrimp were big, but the coating on the walnut shrimp was kind of a turn off for me. Looked like a thick layer of glue. It also came with white rice, and a good amount of it too. The honey walnut shrimp came with steamed broccoli. Presentation was good. 

I would come back to see what their dim sum menu has to offer. Service was not bad but the interior of the restaurant was super cold. Please turn on some heat, this is Chicago! Pretty clean and spacious, however when we were there during late lunch on a Saturday, it was just us and another table."

Previously, we grabbed a groupon to give it a try and went early in the evening to beat the rush....which we definitely did. It was fairly empty. 
They&#39;re slightly tucked away, but I learned that they do a lot of carry out (no delivery) and they get busier later in the evenings. Fair enough.

What initially caught our eye was the fact they have two menus: American-Chinese/Asian food &amp; Chinese-Chinese food (the authentic stuff). 
It seems like a great idea for those craving more traditional Chinese dishes versus what we &#39;gringos&#39; typically go for. 

We opted to get several dishes to share and wash it down with cocktails and beer. (Note: If there was ever a sentence to sum  up what I&#39;d like to do at every restaurant ever for life, that would be it.)

During our second experience, we did carry out, and had an equally pleasant experience with everything we ate.
The beef was once again tender; the fried rice was spot on; the egg rolls were egg-y and rolled.

This is currently our go-to Chinese/Asian restaurant in the area. 
I do wish they had delivery but it&#39;s really not a deal breaker in my book. There are closer restaurants to us in the area who do offer delivery, but so far, none have matched the quality of iChef.

As Yelp would say, Yay I&#39;m a fan."

While there was enough sauce, it was sweet, and definitely not spicy.  I did not finish it, and was happy to see the server asked why.  My dining partner had the iChef Lo Mein.  It was a tad oily (as are many), and while the shrimp and beef were good, the chicken was dry and had an odd taste.

IChef fits the cliché-ish profile of authentic Chinese restaurants in the states: most patrons are expats, two menu system, efficient service, etc. 

The weekend brunch menu offers some quintessential Shanghai-style dim sum items such as pan-fried buns, fried dough sticks, sweet rice ball soup, which I have yet to try. The fish congee was average to me. 

Tofu salad made with smoked tofu -- very refreshing and tasty. It should convert most non-believers of tofu. 

Braised duck with tofu skin: tofu skin is one of my favorite ingredients in Chinese food for its show stealing ability. If you are leery about the texture of tofu, give tofu skin a try: in my experience, it tends to be the most fought-over part of any dish it&#39;s in and always disappear before everything else on the plate. The duck pieces in this dish could be cut bigger, and not so bony though.

Song&#39;s Fish Soup: I only know it&#39;s a classic Hangzhou dish but never had it before, so I can&#39;t attest to its authenticity. It contains lots of fish bits, clean tasting with a little vinegar flavor. Overall it was just ok to me--perhaps it&#39;s the kind of fish used? I might order it again, but not in a hurry.

Shanghai Fish was 2 long boneless fish strips that was battered and deep fried. The fish quality was very good. The fish was smothered with a dark sauce with peas and carrots.

Their menu has some pretty diverse items for the suburbs. They don&#39;t simply have the typical Lo Mein, Chow Mein, Mu Shu, Sweet and Sour and General Tso&#39;s. There are two menus - one the more traditional Americanized Chinese fare, and another with more traditional Chinese.

While there were a few items on the traditional menu that looked interesting, we tried something I&#39;ve never had before called Yu Shang Pork - spicy with julienne vegetables. It looked a little like Mu Shu Pork, but tasted very different. It was really good. We also ordered Szechwan Beef and had an order of dumplings.

Before I finished ordering, I asked the person on the phone if they had any specials or coupons and was told for this sized order I could get either egg drop or hot and sour soup for free. I chose the hot and sour.

We also had some soy bean milk (sweetened) which I haven&#39;t had since I was in Taiwan. This stuff was great! I mean, it doesn&#39;t compare to the stuff in Taiwan but it&#39;s rare that I find stuff like this.

We also had the hao gao (shrimp dumpling) dim sum which is hard to find in the suburbs. They were rather small but tasted just fine.

Another dish we had was the Shanghai style noodles that are a flat long noodle that is curried with some beef and vegetables in there. This is AMAZING. They cook everything with vegetable oil which is fantastic, and the green onions are fried just long enough so that they are crunchy. The carrots and bean sprouts are the same and make a great compliment to the beef.

The last dish we had was the black garlic beef, which I felt didn&#39;t complement the other dishes well. This was the one reason I didn&#39;t give it 5 stars. It came out super buttery (too buttery for my taste buds), but the beef was definitely super tender. I didn&#39;t think they would use this much butter in Chinese style cooking, but I guess that&#39;s what they did.

There are a lot of Chinese people that visit this place and they service is pretty good. I would definitely come here again though it is a little bit pricey."

Tonight I wanted to try some different offerings so I went with sweet &amp; sour chicken, sesame chicken &amp; honey chicken. The honey chicken wasn&#39;t on the menu so I just asked about it and she said yes, it can be done. Score! I have a minor obsession with honey chicken and I use that and sweet &amp; sour chicken as my gauge to see how good a place is. The honey chicken was AMAZING! I will be ordering that everytime I order now. Everything I tasted was quite good!

One good thing about this restaurant is how it offers simple healthier authentic Chinese food in addition to the common staples. For example, fish or beef congee is very difficult to find in the suburbs (I think Hong Kong Cafe is the only other place in the area that makes this item). Hong Sue beef noodle soup and pork noodle soup with preserved vegetables are other dishes people usually go to Chinatown for (Yu&#39;s Mandarin and Chef Ping offer more Northern style noodles).  The stews and authentic soups (not always on the menu) are great to eat during the winter.

There is also an authentic weekend brunch menu with delicious Shanghai favorites (all in Chinese unfortunately). Hopefully they will have a translated version soon so the English speaking clients will be able to enjoy these wonderful dishes as well.

Great place if you live around Palatine, Schaumburg, Arlington Heights, Buffalo Grove, Barrington, or Hoffman Estates, not too far away from Harper College or Northern Illinois University - Hoffman."

The interior looked nicer than we expected and we were eager to try some of their food.  We were sat in a booth, which was very comfy and cozy.  We ordered a couple of Tsingtao beers and looked through the menu.  The menu is divided into two parts: american chinese and authentic traditional chinese.  We looked through the authentic chinese section and chose the honey walnut shrimp, double cooked pork, and the king mushroom and egg tofu dish.  
The honey walnut shrimp was extremely delicious.  The sauce was on point and there was enough shrimp to justify the price.  The double cooked pork was a bit weird.  I didn&#39;t know what to really expect, but I was at least hoping for a good spicy dish(as indicated by the chili pepper graphic next to the dish in the menu).  The dish consisted of strips of thinly sliced pork belly stir fried with bell peppers, scallions, and onions in an extremely mild chili oil sauce.  I really think the dish would have been much better with the addition of actual chili peppers, whether fresh or dry.  The chili oil just didn&#39;t do it for me.  The king mushroom and egg tofu dish was made with a tasty sauce, but the whole dish seemed like it was lacking something.  It was just sliced king mushrooms, extra soft tofu battered with egg, and some scallions.  Maybe the addition of some vegetables or something might have been good.  
Well, that&#39;s how I felt about the food.  I didn&#39;t really feel that the authentic chinese dishes were actually authentic, but maybe a little less americanized than stuff like chop suey and general tso&#39;s chicken...?  The service was good, the ambiance was better than expected, and the food was mediocre.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be returning unless I was in the area and hungry."

Thankfully the chicken was fairly good so I didn&#39;t ask for a replacement. The orange sauce was great. Our scallion pancakes needed more scallions, salt, and pan-frying. The house special Mai Tai tasted like Hawaiian Punch. 

Hopefully the service is better next time, as I&#39;d really like to try the faux beef."

When iChef opened a few years ago, taking over Lily Garden&#39;s spot, they served semi-decent Chinese American food. Prices were a bit high, but that seems to be the norm nowadays for Chinese. Haven&#39;t eaten there recently, so we decided to order take out on Saturday at 5pm - not only did the hot and sour soup taste like &#34;end of the day&#34; soup from the bottom of the pot, but the large Mongolian beef was mainly crispy noodles, and I had around 5 whole shrimp in my small cashew shrimp. The egg rolls tasted undercooked too. Everything was just so... bland. 

I found the tinsel the next day when I reheated the shrimp. It didn&#39;t arc or spark in the microwave, but it was clearly not edible. The woman who rung me out told me the menu was new, but I&#39;m guessing tinsel wasn&#39;t supposed to be part of the revamp. Boo.

Just noticed Barb Z&#39;s review - we are not the same person, but obviously feel the same about the current menu."

We arrived early in the evening on a weeknight and found only 3 other tables occupied. A member of the wait staff promptly seated us and gave us a specials menu as well as the regular dinner menu. We didn&#39;t even bother really looking at the regular menu as we had our hearts set on something different. Dong Po Braised Pork and Hot Wok Chicken is what we ordered and was told the pork would take just a little bit longer than other dishes which was fine.  

The chicken was nice and spicy and came out in a ceramic bowl still sizzling. I really enjoyed the presentation and concept but unfortunately I found the sauce to be overpoweringly salty which forced us to eat large amounts of rice in accompaniment. Another issue was that the chef cuts a whole chicken up in to bite size pieces without taking any of the bones out. I was told that most traditional dishes are made with bone in which I can understand except there were tiny little pieces of bone EVERYWHERE and it was really difficult to eat. I was glad nobody was watching us eat because we were constantly spitting out bits of bone with every bite. When I spoke to the waitress about this at the end of our meal she said it might be possible to request the dish sans bones which is exactly how I&#39;ll order it next time... also without any salt.

The braised pork was ultra rich and a perfect match with the little steamed buns that come with it. The actual amount of meat may seem small but the rich nature of the dish paired with the buns is enough to satiate any appetite and we had trouble finishing the entire dish. It was a very unique and tasty change from the shrimp fried rice/battered meats with different sauces that we&#39;ve grown so pathetically accustomed to.

I want to give this place 4 stars but I&#39;m going to have to go back again and try a few more dishes before I can honestly raise the rating. I had nobody to coach me through this experience so I&#39;ll have to stumble my way around until I really discover my true opinion about iChef."

They serve both American Chinese **and** traditional Chinese.  I came for lunch on a weekday when no one was there.  Although the server did not seem to know the menu and was not the friendliest, I was willing to overlook it because there aren&#39;t many Chinese restaurants in the suburbs trying to do something different.  

I am so glad I did.  I ordered the Singapore noodles.  They are thin rice noodles mixed with vegetables, shrimp and pork.  It was cooked to perfection, the bean sprouts must have been picked the same day - super fresh.  The noodles were lightly flavored with curry rather than drowning in gravy.  I added some chili peppers because I like my food spicy, but anyone else would love it as is.  

The server told me ingredients are brought fresh from Chinatown each day, including some live seafood items.  I think the Chef must be brought in from Chinatown, too, because I just don&#39;t find this type of **real** Chinese food in the suburbs.

Bottom line, don&#39;t let a bad experience with the wait staff deter you from experiencing the wonderful food here.  Maybe there are better authentic Chinese restaurants in the Chicago area, Chinatown included, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find one within 15 miles of this place.  Come and enjoy!"

IChef replaced the Canto gem, Lily Garden.  The sign is bright and the English name is nonsensical.  The Chinese name &#34;chuan zhe hui&#34; means a fusion cuisine between Sichuan and Zhejiang - two of the eight main regional cuisines in Chinese cooking.  

The menu was divided into two halves -  first half with items written in English only (your standard American Chinese food such as egg foo yang and crab rangoon), and second half with items that have Chinese translation (these are traditional Chinese dishes).  Since it was a family dinner, we ordered from the second half exclusively.  

Dongpo braised pork was pretty spot on - tender pork belly with a nice sweet and savory sauce.  If they skim the sauce, it would have been a great dish.  Water-boiled fish, which might sound super bland and boring to people unfamiliar with Sichuan food; but it&#39;s actually a spicy pot of soup with tender fish and napa cabbage.  It&#39;s a classic Sichuan dish, and IChef&#39;s version was pretty good, with a nice kick, but didn&#39;t have enough Sichuan pepper.  Satay beef with noodle casserole was flavorful - the Satay was actually Taiwanese-style, which was a nice nostalgic moment for me.  But the beef was old-school Canto-style, which means it was tender to the point of mushy, likely the result of marination in soda-water.  Pine cone fish came highly recommended by the waitress as their signature (which was weird considering it&#39;s a Shangdong-style dish, very different from the alleged specialty of this restaurant).  The flavor and the execution were good, but I couldn&#39;t help but compare it to the original version - they used fillet, not whole fish; and they used flounder, which didn&#39;t really taste like yellow croaker.  

Decor was rather nondescript, but pleasant enough.  The gender on the bathroom doors was indicated by  either Ken or Barbie - creative but creepy (check out my pic).  Service was amateurish.  The waitstaff was friendly but obviously not well-trained.  Many rookie mistakes throughout.  For example, the four of us ordered four dishes, thinking it was more than enough, but the waitress (who I believe is also the owner) asked if that was all, to which I said yes.  Then she said &#34;are you sure you don&#39;t want another vegetarian dish?  You didn&#39;t order any vegetables.&#34;  Um, give unsolicited advice much?  I will eat my broccoli at home, thank you very much.  

In Chinatown, this restaurant will probably not survive.  But in the suburbs, this place is decent enough, with some authentic dishes hard to find outside of Chinatown.  I will probably go back if I&#39;m too lazy to go to the city or Naperville."

Crab Rangoon: Very yummy and fresh tasting.

We went there for lunch today and were the only 2 people in the restaurant. First off it smelled like Raid..ok we should have probably left then but because of the overall good ratings and Yelp decal on the window decided to give it a try.

Started out with egg rolls and order of pot stickers. Egg rolls tasted commercial and pot stickers had a flavorable filling but way to doughy.

Hubby ordered shrimp in garlic sauce and I ordered pan fried noodles with shrimp.

Our server brought out the dishes and realized that the chef made a mistake and brought out a different shrimp dish then what he ordered so his went back to the kitchen. Ok pan fried noodles should be pan fried. I saw a little browning on a bit of the noodles but the rest looked like they were boiled and heaped on the plate. The real turn off was the sauce. It was your typical white sauce that you would get at your takee out place for chicken chop suey. For color they threw on a few pea pods and then topped it off with the shrimp. I have had wonderful pan fried noodles at other places and believe me this was not the way to serve it.

Hubbys shrimp in garlic sauce is now served and as server is walking away I ask should his not come with rice? Oops she forgot rice:) Neither of us cared for the sauce on his dish. We both ended up doctoring up both of our dishes with the sauce they served with the pot stickers and the sweet sour sauce served with the egg rolls.

Ever since I saw their Chinese brunch menu and discovered this place serves Shang Hai style food, couldn&#39;t hold myself back.  I tried google translator in attempt to translate their chinese menu, but no success.  I just went hoping a server would help us out.  And Voila! They made the weekend brunch menu in English now.  Below is the list of dishes I tried today.  Onion Pancake (scallion), Potstickers, shrimp dumpling, Pan-fried Pork Bun, Shang Hai stir fried rice cake, Shanghai Spring Roll, Beef Congee, Orange Beef and sugar buns.  Orange Beef was very good, congee was wonderful.  Green Onion Pancake was the best I ever had.  Crunch outside, and had lots of layers with no overwhelming green onion.  I love sugar buns. I thought you could only get these from Chinese Buffet, but you could get them at Ichef. 10 for $3.95, sweet deal.  Shrimp dumpling was so yummy.  It&#39;s about 1/2 size of usual Ha Gao, so it&#39;s cute and easier to eat at 1 bite.  Shang Hai Stir-friend rice cake was yummy, but rice cakes were stuck in big clump and not that easy to separate.  If a few were stuck together, OK, but when 8 or 9 are stuck like that, it&#39;s not easy to eat.   Potstickers and other meat filled buns had tasty fillings, but dough was much thicker than my liking.  However, overall, we enjoyed service very much and food.  I live 3 minutes from this place and we definitely will become regulars.  Can&#39;t wait to try other Shang Hai style dishes."

The choices for toppings was much bigger than I anticipated. The food was ready in minutes. I was almost expecting it to be more like Pizza Hut where you place your order and it takes 15-20 minutes. I had my pizza within 5 minutes.  
I was also impressed with the fact that the person who made my pizza was not the same person who took my money. I dislike it when I order food and see them make my food, take off the gloves, take my money and then put on a new pair of gloves without washing hands to make the next order. This time it was two different people. 
They have the new Coke machines with all the varieties of drinks! So I could get a Coke Zero with lime.

Who TF wants bbq marinara? He was nice enough to start over though. 

As for the toppings, they don&#39;t have a lot of the gourmet options. No fresh mozzarella, arugula, etc. Pretty basic toppings.

The crust itself was super super thin. The pan one is too thick. They need a better middle ground. They also don&#39;t use a wood-fired brick oven like Blaze. Boo. 

We also got the chocolate brownie pecan thing and they refused to warm it up for us because it would &#34;infect&#34; the oven... what? Not only did they give us a stale, dry last slice but refused to help make it better. smh.

Overall, okay place to get quick pizza, but go to Blaze and then you&#39;ll know what you&#39;re missing."

I also wanted to avoid getting back on the tollway right away because of the traffic that I saw coming in. So, I did a quick Yelp search and found this place. 

Set up similar to Subway, where you can choose your toppings, there are quite a few to choose from. You can also choose your crust type, sauce, and cheese. The price is set regardless of the pizza you choose, so if you like a variety of toppings like I do, this can save you some cash. However, if you&#39;re like to keep it simple with just cheese or one or two toppings, this may be a tad expensive. 

Once your finished directing the making of your pizza, it gets put in the oven. By the time you finish paying, grabbing your drink, and finding a table, the pizza was ready. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of pizza for such a fast turnaround."

Tonight my friend and I stopped in and tried the pizza for the first time. The guys behind the counter helping create a pizza were very friendly and offered many suggestions. If they didn&#39;t know an answer to a question about an ingredient they were happy to check for the answer and didn&#39;t seem put out at all. The cashier said they are supposed to start carrying a vegan cheese option soon! Hope that&#39;s true!

**updated review on 4/18/16**

They now carry Daiya vegan cheese shreds!
I&#39;m very glad the company decided to offer a vegan cheese option. Stopped in today and had a &#34;create my own&#34; pizza which was delicious! My favorite toppings included the kalamata olives, basil, and cilantro. My only suggestion is that the vegan cheese be kept with the veggie toppings instead of next to the dairy cheeses because it would be very easy for some dairy cheese to fall into the vegan cheese in a cross contamination situation. 
Also, a tip for vegans make sure you ask for a clean cutting board and clean pizza cutter!"

In walks Pie Five....YAY!  The gluten free crust is slightly crunchy and chewy...

The cost is pretty good.  A pizza is $6.99...add $2 for gluten free.  For $10 total ($12 GF) you can get pizza, dessert, and drink.  For $11 total ($13 GF) you can get pizza, salad, and drink.

They have a rewards program.  Sign up for the Circle of Crust.  You get half off on your half birthday.  You also accrue points for a free pizza.

The line gets rather long during lunch time.  Plan for extra time!

If you do gluten free...do not get the alfredo sauce....do not get the alfredo sauce.  I did that on my first visit.  Big mistake!  I wish someone working there would have alerted me.  Oh well, live and learn."

I had the BBQ Pizza and he had the Windy City Works.   The classic pan crust on my pizza was awesome and didn&#39;t have that too much bread vibe that many deep dish pizzas give you.  Temptation gave in, so we had the chocolate chip pie and turtle pie as dessert.  Both were delicious, I highly recommend trying at least one.

So while driving by I decided to stop in.  I got their thin crust pizza with marinara, mozzarella, cheddar, sausage, ham, green &amp; red peppers, and sun dried tomatoes.  

First off, like I mentioned I have not been here before.  I mentioned this to the guy taking my order and he was super helpful!  He explained everything the whole way through and it was very easy to place my order!  

The pizza &amp; soft drink was about $10.  Not cheap, but not very pricey either, considering all the toppings I picked.  How was it?  Well, it was great!  Tasted super fresh and really good!  I order pizza often (at least 3 times a month, probably more); usually from Lou Malnati&#39;s.  Now, I may say Lou&#39;s thin crust is slightly better, but, who wouldn&#39;t.  I mean Lou&#39;s is a Chicago pizza king, everyone knows them and they are awesome.  But, for a fast food pizza, Pie Five Pie Pizza Co is ahead of the curve!  This tastes nothing like fast food pizza.  It actually tastes and looks like quality!

1. We want a delicious hot pizza, but we want something fresh instead of a slice that may have been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.
2. We want pizza, but we&#39;re trying to be more adventurous and eat something different instead of having the same standard combinations all the time.
3. We&#39;re going out with friends, but with a large group it&#39;s hard to get just one or two pizzas that will satisfy everyone&#39;s dietary needs and food preferences.

Fortunately, Pie Five Pizza Co helps to solve all of these problems. While it&#39;s not the most amazing pizza you&#39;ll have in your life -- it is surprisingly good for something that&#39;s made in 5 minutes, with lots of customization options, fresh ingredients, and is a lot of fun. I enjoyed the classic pan more than the thin crusts (maybe it&#39;s the Chicagoan in me) and felt that overall the pizzas could have used a bit more ingredients. But did like the fresh taste and not-too-salty composition of all the pizzas I tried. The cooks were very friendly and the service was excellent (very well kept and clean tables).

The decor is modern and trendy, which is especially noticable in the washrooms. The salads were presented with a well-composed gourmet look to them, although the flavor wasn&#39;t anything special and it could&#39;ve been a bit lighter on the dressing. The cookie pie with a nice rich chocolate touch was a perfect way to end the meal.

Overall, a really cool concept with relatively good food and a great place to take friends. I&#39;ll definitely be back again."

When I saw a new shop go in on my way to work, I had to do some investigating online to find out what this Pie Five place was. Pie Five Pizza Co officially opens April 10th but I was lucky enough to go a special preview event for lunch today. And I&#39;m so kind and generous, I brought along my lunch crew of five fellas to chow down, as well.

When I found out another pizza place was opening, I thought to myself...is this really necessary? But Pie Five has a slightly different twist on the normal pizza experience. It&#39;s more of a fast casual pizza dining spot and their whole schtick is your pizza will be done in five minutes (pie FIVE). So basically Pie Five is the Roti/Chipotle/Potbelly&#39;s of pizza. 

You can either order one of their speciality pizzas or make your own, you can pick a salad (why would you do that!?), or try one of their three desserts which all sound mouthwatering. Many of their speciality pizza combos sound mighty delicious to me like the Chicken Carbonara pizza - alfredo sauce, mushrooms, chicken, bacon &amp; parmesan?! Yes, please. I actually loved this pizza. It&#39;s normally $6.99 and the ingredients went together quite well, fabulous tasting alfredo sauce, solid crust. My coworkers were saying they wished their pizza choices had a bit more meat though. The personal pizza completely filled me up!

They have a Coke Freestyle! I never get tired of these things. I think they are an essential for a fast casual spot like this and I&#39;m very happy they have one! Locked myself up some Mello Yello Zero Cherry baby.

I really wanted to try all three of their dessert options but settled on trying just one as to not be the gluttonous monster I truly am. I went with the Chocolate Chip pie, with the other options being brownie or turtle. They do their desserts in the same round pizza style format in which you can get a slice for $1.69 or the whole shebang for $9.99. I actually loved my slice of cookie yumness. I&#39;m dying to try the other desserts on the menu.

Our overall consensus is it&#39;s definitely a place we&#39;d come back. We&#39;d all like to try some of the different menu options but were happy with the prices, the food, the drink options and the service was great. Of course it&#39;s pre-opening but it&#39;s still kind of funny hearing managers remind employees to smile. These were some super happy employees though I must say. One guy in particular who was taking the pizzas out of the oven, he should get a gold star for friendliness and happiness, he could light up a room! ha! 

Welcome to Schaumburg, Pie Five Pizza! You&#39;re going to be a great lunch option for us business folk in the area."

They only serve personal-size pizzas or kids personal pizzas. The price for any type of crust and any ingredients are the same for all pizzas, which is nice, and the price is reasonable. You&#39;re going to pay a little more than normal to feed your family than you would if you just got a single pizza, but the variety of options allowing each person to get exactly what they want make it worth it. I&#39;ve tried a few of their pizzas and all were very good.  The kids pizzas are smaller and cheaper and only one ingredient but just as delicious.

My only complaint is that the process of telling the workers what you want on each pizza is very slow. This is not really a problem if you&#39;re showing up outside of a rush time but since we often show up a little earlier than the average person eats, we would always be treated to watching a very long and slow line barely move when 3 or 4 families showed up around the same time. You&#39;ll wait about 1-2 minutes per person in front of you in line.

Thank you to yelp event, they opened their doors to yelp elites to sample their menu the night before their grand opening.  It was so great that we came back on the day they opened. 

The idea is to make your pizza within 5 minutes so hey, select your toppings and get that pizza moving. You can make your own pizza or if you&#39;re indecisive, they can help with that too. They have a menu of already selected pizza like bbq chicken and Windy City pizza. 

I love making my own and i love their thin crust.  Get creative and get all 3 kinds of cheese or put everything you can think of on your pizza.

I think the two things that works for this place - FAST and AFFORDABLE. The pizza is not that big, a HUNGRY person can easily demolish that. 5 minutes for making a pizza, so you can always go back and get some more. The place has good area and good seating arragements. I think the pies they have here are good as well, though it might be a little hard to eat (with a toothpick - got some samples as well).

This is a genius concept. All pizzas are the same price, no matter how many toppings you put on, what crust you choose, or if you make your own or choose one of theirs. For a few bucks more you can add a drink and dessert or salad. They had plenty of different toppings, sauces, and crusts to choose from (even a gluten free one). Everything is made right in front of you and takes no time at all to make. You can take it to go or eat inside. I ordered the margarita pizza and loved it. Just the right size and delicious!

Pie Five is essentially one of those &#34;build it in front of you&#34; places, like Subway and Chipotle, but specializes in pizza. And *everybody* loves pizza! They even have vegetarian/vegan/gluten free options. 

You can choose one of their speciality pizzas or, if you&#39;re picky like me, you can build your own. As a first-timer I really wasn&#39;t sure what the process was like and the employee didn&#39;t care to explain it, but it was simple enough. Pick your crust, then your base (marinara, spicy marinara, Alfredo, olive oil, and some others I can&#39;t remember) and then your meats - get as many as you want! Get extra! It&#39;s all a set price, so you won&#39;t get charged for double meat or extra cheese.

Then you choose your veggies (and there&#39;s an ample selection of those). Pile on as many or as little toppings as you want before they put the pizza in the oven. When it&#39;s cooked you can choose to add extra Parmesan, feta, and/or mozzarella cheese, oregano, basil, and their signature &#34;Magic Dust,&#34; all at no additional charge. 

A single personal pizza with unlimited toppings is $7, but for $10 you can get a large drink and a dessert pizza/side salad as well. It&#39;s really a great value for the price, although my pizza tasted so good that I wish I got a second one for later.

Peace out, Subway pizza. I&#39;ll definitely be returning!"

You get to pick and choose what you want on the pizza and they throw it in the oven for you. They have preset pizzas if you can&#39;t decide what to put together. 

Yes it&#39;ll cost more and is smaller than a Little Ceasars pizza but they have better ingredient."

everything was clean and fast... the amount of toppings you can add on was awesome, i almost didn&#39;t know where to start. my ONLY &#34;complaint&#34; is i wish there were labels on/above each topping. i know-it&#39;s pretty self explanatory but with the variety of options it just would&#39;ve been a little easier on the eyes.

the pizzas were in and out of the oven within 5 minutes... PERFECT. me and my bf both got the pan crust and were impressed by how soft BUT crispy the crust was (always a pain when the edges of a pizza are a struggle to bite through) and the entire thing tasted fresh! this place is amazing, i&#39;m glad to have stumbled upon it.

oh, the breadsticks were delicious as well as the chocolate chip pie. for the quality of the food here, the price is unbeatable."

The toppings were pretty basic, but mix and matching them you can come up with some pretty wild ideas.  This particular chain does a good job spelling out your options and streamlining the process so you get through the line in around six minutes.  The pie is okay, probably why I&#39;m giving it only 4 stars.  The price is great, a plus for a guy only looking for a simple lunch, especially when I&#39;m tired of eating at Chipotle every day.

The concept is like this: you create your own pizza from the start, and the employees make it in front of you, kind of like a Chipotle or a Subway.  There are the suggested pies, such as the BBQ Chicken, Farmer&#39;s Market, and my favorite, the High Five.  Or you can make your own pizza with as many toppings as you like.  There are also different crusts: I prefer the pan, but there is also thin crust, gluten-free, and whole wheat.  The pizza cooks for a few minutes, and you pay at the counter.  I usually get a combo meal: a pizza, a side salad or dessert, and a fountain pop for about $10. 

The pizza is delicious!  Especially with a sprinkling of the Magic Dust!

The friendly workers are great as well. They know their product, work productively and professionally, and couldn&#39;t be kinder to our two kids.

The pizza looks like a piece of art coming out of the oven and looks beautiful on my plate. BUT the dough, crust, way it is cooked etc. does not work.  Einstein said  &#34;Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results&#34;.I have now tried thin crust about 3 times now and come back with the same feeling. I prefer the open hearth ovens of BLAZE any day.  Those pizzas look good and taste good and the ovens cook a pizza like it should be cooked.  It is more on the lines of a wood fired stone oven pizza.  But then, I am a pizza lover who has to work out 4 days a week to just keep off the pizza fat from places like Moretti&#39;s, Lou Malnati&#39;s, Domino&#39;s etc.  So if you are not that picky about your pizza, celebrate Pie Five&#39;s pizza concept.

Pizza that is...bwawawawaaaaaa--I mean what else would I be referring to---especially at a place called Pie Five Pizza LOL

Smack it up, rub it down, flip it up----yep the pizza dough.... not too bad---you can get it thin, pan, wheat, or gluten free.

Went with a group of kiddies---perfect place for the picky eater.  The 6&#34; is the kids size and would probably be ok for a kid under 5----any older and might as well just get the regular size--and so glad we did---otherwise there definitely would&#39;ve been a table of hangry kids.

Parking was ample.  Lots of places to sit at around 5pm on a weekday.  Staff was nice enough, most likely a few newbies--but hey they gotta start somewhere.  The freestyle pop machine was fantastic and let me live out my fantasy of vanilla cherry sprite with a twist of lime.

The kids all made their own pizzas and gobbled them up.  I tried the chicken carbonara (suggested pie)---and what was nice was I was still able to add on other toppings--hooray! The folks behind me ordered a side salad--they can in strange pizza crust shaped bowls---looked alright but probably will not be partaking in that.

Overall nice concept, decent pizza, be sure to join their rewards program---because well----why not?  If we go there enough a free pie could be in our future.  Will be back."

This place is awesome, think Chipotle, but for pizza.

Upon walking in, the first thing I noticed was the extremely friendly employees. I was greeted by a girl and guy behind the counter. They were very nice and patient as I decided what I wanted to order. I also noticed that the restaurant is super clean. 
For $10, you can get a freshly/custom made personal pizza, a drink and a dessert. If you don&#39;t want dessert, you can pay an extra dollar and get a salad instead.    

You start by picking your crust: they have artisan thin, pan, whole grain and gluten free crust.  Next you choose your sauce: they have Tuscan marinara, spicy marinara, BBQ, buffalo ranch, olive oil and Alfredo. After that, you pick your cheese: they have mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta and cheddar cheese. Next, you pick your toppings, as many as you want with no additional charge! They have tons of toppings, any meat/veggie topping that I could think of, I saw. They also have specialty pizzas you can pick, like BBQ chicken, chicken Alfredo, margherita, the Athenian, etc. 

I decided on the artisan thin crust, Tuscan marinara sauce, with mozzarella and parmesan cheese. For toppings, I got pepperoni on the whole pizza, and Canadian bacon and pineapple on half. For drinks, they have one of those Coca-Cola freestyle machines. I also saw different flavors of iced tea. For the dessert options, you can get a slice of regular or turtle brownie, or a slice of chocolate chip cookie. I got the turtle brownie.

After you select your toppings, they put your pizza in the oven and it&#39;s ready in about two minutes. I was worried that it wouldn&#39;t be fully cooked or the crust wouldn&#39;t taste right since it cooks so fast. But it was actually cooked perfectly. It was delicious, I have no complaints. By the way, the pizzas are bigger than any other personal pizza I&#39;ve had at other places. It&#39;s a 9 inch pizza, it was definitely filling. The turtle brownie was also delicious. 

While we were eating, an employee came over to our table to make sure we were okay and enjoying our food, which I thought was really nice. I absolutely love the overall concept of this place, all of the employees are very friendly, and the food was delicious. I&#39;ll be back for sure!!"

However it just so happened that I was in the area following a dentist appointment so I stopped by.    I went in during their non-rush hour after 4pm.    The signage and general interior design reminded me of a few other places like M Burger and Meatheads.   Wonder if they are owned by the same conglomerate.    Though obviously that matters not for now.

 I was greeted right away by a couple of the servers eager to get my order going.    After perusing the options on the wall I decided on one of their specialty pizzas, their chicken carbonara.   I went with their recommended crust style and also requested extra mushrooms on mine which they had no problem adding.   I deliberately timed the order and it wound up being close to five minutes when it came out of their oven.    Pretty cool to have express fresh pizza.   I also ordered a slice of their chocolate chip cookie cake.    

Overall I enjoyed the pizza.   The crust was just a step above frozen pizza.   It won&#39;t be replacing my Lou&#39;s anytime soon but for a fast quick option, Pie 5 does hit the spot."

They have a cool soda machine. I&#39;ve seen these before, but I&#39;m still amazed every time I see one.

This place is like a Subway or Chipotle.... but for pizza! 

They have build your own pizzas for $6.99 &amp; salads for $2.99, but the best deal would be to get the meal which includes pizza, salad, &amp; a drink for $9.99. Dont forget to try the Magic Dust!

We walked in and saw a pretty good variety of pizzas. I got myself a veggie pizza with some extra mushrooms (because I am a fan of mushrooms) while my wife got something with chicken. Pie Five offers different kinds of crusts, and I think I got a whole wheat one. 

I also picked up one of the pieces of &#34;dessert pizza&#34;, the turtle one I think. For what it&#39;s worth, it was very fudgy and good. 

To summarize: the pizza is very thin because it has to be, and it&#39;s sort of miraculous that I&#39;m able to be eating a pizza five minutes after I order it. Despite its thinness the pizza isn&#39;t particularly crispy, but this is more than made up by the freshness of the dough, the ingredients and the time it takes to make. 

This won&#39;t be replacing deep dish anytime soon (or ever, to be honest) but as a lunch stop, it&#39;s pretty awesome.

I guess it is pretty new and I am always for checking new plces out.  They have a couple of different selections as far as crust. I was deciding between flatbread and personal pan. I went with the latter. They have a few different sauces. A marinara and a spicy marinara.  There are a HUGE amount of ingredients and you can get as many ingredients as you want on it.  I went with pork sausage, carmelized onions, and &#34;magic dust&#34; which is italian seasoning and parmasean and another cheese or something. The service was quick and friendly (after constructing the pizza, it takes 5 minutes to cook.  The pizza crust (at least the pan) comes out golden brown and crisp.

The concept is great. You do not need to order a huge about of pizza from Domino&#39;s, Pizza Hut, or Papa John&#39;s. If you want a personalize sized, somewhat fresh (I say somewhat as the meat options are &#34;heated&#34; when baked) - go to Pie Five! You can choose what type of crust  you get for any type of pizza! Extra cheese? No Prob. It&#39;s all inclusive in their 6.99 build your own pizza price. 

Oh and they have their own salads there too, filled in a pizza crust! I haven&#39;t tried it yet.. but it looked like a salad?

One downside to it is if you go there at a downtime, there&#39;s only 1 person that will be building pizzas - the line will feel like it will never move. There were about 5 people ahead of us and took us literally 15-20 minutes to finally order something. Then you wait an additional 5 (ish) minutes for your pizza to bake. It was a really long wait. If I was there by myself, I would have left. SO with that said, I would go back when they are properly staffed. 

Staffing can be more efficient. Food is great. I would go back.. but not at like 7pm."

All of the ingredients are laid out in front of you and you just choose whatever and however much you want. You even choose what kind of crust and sauce you want. My favorite is the pan crust as it not only tastes good but has just the right amount of fluff and softness to it. Pizzas take 5 minutes to cook thus the name Pie FIVE.

As their marketing guy told me, they want to be the Chipotle of pizza. Fresh ingredients, and made just for you. The experience here is assembly line: you walk by the counter, and the staff makes your pizza to your specifications. They have choices in crust, sauce, cheese, toppings. Unique to Chicago is Italian beef. The spicy marinara sauce actually has a bit of a kick (they did start in Texas). There are three different kinds of tomatoes (fresh, roasted, sun-dried). Your pizza then goes into a conveyor oven. When done, you are offered a choice of more toppings (pesto drizzle, magic dust). You pay and get your drink. There is one Coke Freestyle machine, which has the potential to cause a wait. (Virtually every other place has two: Pei Wei, Five Guys, etc.). The decor is black and red, with many Pie Five pizza logo accents. Their corner unit has two walls of windows, so it&#39;s very bright. There&#39;s a potential for the line to get tangled up in the vestibule. But you have to have double doors to get through a Chicago winter without freezing your diners!  The staff here is very friendly and efficient. They all seem excited to be part of this new pizza world. Oh, yeah, they also have salads and three desserts. I was particularly excited that they offer a gluten-free crust. It is really good, and blows away any other I&#39;ve had in a restaurant. However, even though the staff is trying VERY hard not to cross-contaminate (changing gloves, using a different metal plate, boxing your pizza at the end, using a separate brush to apply sauce), your GF pizza is still made on the same line as all the wheat pizzas. Know yourself. I have eaten here three times with no problems. But unless they have a separate line and oven...it&#39;s going to be impossible to keep it totally clean. They are right next to BW3 and Five Guys. I&#39;m excited this option is in the greater shopping/dining/working metro IKEA area. Good luck, Pie Five!"

You get to pick as many toppings as you want, choice of crust and sauce, or you can select from one of their many signature combinations.  We went with the Garden Fresh and the Chicken Alfredo Pesto.  Filling, tasty, fresh, and fast... but minus 1 star for the meh service.  None of their employees were smiling or enthusiastic.

Glad I did.  We got the High Five and the Athenian.  Both were very tasty.  Prices were good, especially since you can add toppings at no extra charge.  Staff was friendly.   

My only complaint if you will, I think due the pizza&#39;s being &#34;personal&#34; size, and the quick cooking time (which is great!), the pizza did not stay hot/warm very long, and by the last few slices may have been bordering on cold.  But, I eat cold pizza all the time!  

Definitely will be back."

Fed 2 kids with their own Za, my Chicago Classic (like a beef with giard pizza), 2 dessert pies, three drinks under 25 bucks. 

Work on the red sauce and this could be 5 stars. 

The margherita uses shredded mozzarella instead of buffalo but, still good. 

You could load up a Za with tons of ingredients and easily feed two adults.

The menu is limited its pizza, salad, desert. But I&#39;m all about pizza so I was good with that :) 

There was plenty of seating, could use more than one soda machine. they have frequent diners card, not sure if you have to have it each time as you have to set it up on-line.

For my boyfriend and I, I require Gluten Free crust and he prefers thick crust pizza.  We have different tastes and preferences but still wanted to grab a pizza to go after a long day!

Got the pan crust five star pizza. The crust tasted bad and undercooked. The sauce was very plain tasting, it reminded me of the pizza packets you got in those old lunchables pizzas. The sausage was that kind of tiny gross bits of sausage and the rest of the ingredients were fairly tasteless. Pizza was barely warm and got room temperature in about one minute. I didn&#39;t even finish mine. Got the side salad too, which was served in a stale tortilla bowl for some reason. Garden salad is just lettuce, tomatoes and shredded carrots. 2 stars because they have one of those pop machines that can make any kind of pop."

Even though I know what I told him, I said &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I thought I said no barbecue sauce when I ordered&#34;. I work in customer service, I know how things can be misunderstood. Plus, the music was really loud so maybe he didn&#39;t hear me. He then slammed the ruined crust into the garbage and proceeds to angrily make our pizzas.

A few days later we received another email that said kids eat free every Sunday in July. We loaded the kids into the car and went there, only to be told that they don&#39;t do that. When we showed them the email they said, &#34;oh, that must be a corporate thing. We are not a corporate store.&#34; And how was that our fault? How were we, or anyone else, supposed to know that? We received an email from Pie Five. It didn&#39;t say anything about corporate stores and franchise stores. This was incredibly disappointing and bait and switch.

Visited this place for first time today and it was packed, could be bcoz it was Friday evening. The quantity or size of the pizza felt too small for the pizza. A+ for the toppings and cheese looked yummy to me. My kids said they would love to go back again and they had healthy options and good decor. This kinda reminded me of subway pizza where you choose everything and they make pizza right in front of your while you pay. I recommend to friends to visit this place and decide themselves. Can&#39;t go wrong for one visit in my opinion. 

Only TIP - Honestly unless your kid is 3 yr old the kids pizza is like the size of a stretched pancake, that&#39;s the only con."

Once we finally got our food sorted out and everything, we headed to the dining room to find a table to enjoy our pizza, but not to my surprise, every single table was used and left dirty. Piles of napkins and spilled soda, Parmesan cheese and salt sprinkled about and paper straw wrappers everywhere.

However soon as you  walk inside you feel like you have been coming here for years (my first time there)..

As I was looking at the menu on the wall and deciding what to order... Decided on a couple slices of pizza and a chicago style hot dog..  The owner I assume is very nice, makes you feel like a customer whos been coming there for ages..

Everything seems made to order as I had to wait 5-10  mins for order...No problem was prewarned by owner as he said will be a few mins..

Kind of was hoping they had some lemonade of some sort however is just coke, water, and few others in cans...  Howeever am sure don&#39;t  sell a lot so no worries..

So i receive my food and on way..  Get home everything is still piping hot..

I eat the chicago style hot dog its good, nice flavor there is nothing bad to say about it.. Other  than the pickle was an off brand...  Can tell wasn&#39;t a food brand pickle..  Would order again really want to try other kinds of dogs they sell.

The pizza.  I had to really let this cool down it was hot hot hot.. The  sauce, the cheese, the sausage was all the perfect amount and tasted great.   The crusted tasted reat as well however for some reason it was a little doughy even thou the pizza was so hot..  Kind of undercooked I suppose..  Will I hold it against them no it happens.

Overall I will definitely be going back here..  Tons more on menu I wanna try and prices are great..  Definetely  the diamond in the rough in bartlett."

I have to tell you......YUM!

We have ordered delivery now a couple times and both times received our food promptly from a very chill and polite delivery boy.  The delivery offer is a godsend because now I can order on those lazy weekend days when I&#39;m too hungover to think about driving.

I&#39;ve eaten more or less everything off the menu at this point and it&#39;s all great. The hickory burger and Jalapeno Cheddar Burger are my favorites. and OH MY GOD the buffalo wings are perfect. It&#39;s still all about the Chicken Tandoori and mexican pizza&#39;s though.

On top of everything, Sam is one of the most sincere and kindest restaurant owners I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. He always makes you feel extremely welcome the second you walk into his restaurant.  My only regret of ordering delivery is not getting to stop in and say hi!

- ORIGINAL REVIEW -


I&#39;ve been holding off reviewing this place for a bit because I wanted to try a lot of their stuff, but upon eating the Chicken Tandoori Pizza last night, i can no longer stay silent. 

It was among the finest pies I have eaten in my life.

The fresh cut fries they serve manage to be crispy, not soggy, as so many other establishments do. The deep fried taco is stuff of legends.

I will not stop, nay, I CAN&#39;T stop going here until I sample everything on the menu.

The people here are the friendliest dudes, if you have to wait awhile for food, trust me, it is worth it!!!"

I ordered the pizza and the best way I can describe it is it tasted like a frozen Totinos. The sauce was ultra sweet, the crust was very undercooked with no flavor and the sausage was just so plain and blah! It was like a frozen pizza cooked in a microwave.. Did not try anything else but after that there&#39;s really no reason to..."

Best wings ever, first of all the wings are huge and second they are delicious, we have only tried buffalo and parmesan garlic.

Well, make your way over to Sam&#39;s, introduce yourself to Sam (trust me, you can&#39;t miss him) and tell him you need a fried taco....STAT! Let him be creative, because he is innovative and a wonderful cook!

Seriously, I love Sam, his wife and their son, Nick. They are some of the kindest people I have encountered in years. AAAAAND they know how to cook.

They have a few seats inside but it&#39;s mostly a takeout place and with the sweetest staff at your service, it can def be a place to grab a bite for lunch or a quickie dinner.

I have only had a fried taco and some fresh cut French fries SO FAR but I have to tell you that their food is delish! They obviously use all fresh ingredients and everything is very well seasoned. I cannot wait to explore Sam&#39;s menu further. 

I look forward to my next visit when I hope I can try their Saturday rib special ($18.99/ full slab or $9.99/ half slab) or one of their burgers that I understand Sam mixes with his special combination of seasonings. 

I intend on going back to soon to support our local business owner and get my fix of good food at a place I think I could hang out at for hours and hours."

We got the Tandoori Chicken pizza, which wasn&#39;t really my cup of tea (I am a total baby when it comes to spicy food), it was obvious that the ingredients were of quality and after shuffling my chicken pieces over to my husband&#39;s slice, it was wonderful. We also got some fries, which I did heartily chow down on. I&#39;m particular when it comes to fries. They have to be right. If you&#39;re like me, come here, because they definitely do it right.

The burgers are GREAT! One of my favorites is the Hickory Burger. The man is a surgeon with bacon. It&#39;s cooked well, it&#39;s constructed tightly so the ingredients aren&#39;t sliding out of the burger while you eat it. Something I admire in burgers the same way I do sushi that doesn&#39;t fall apart when you pick it up. The hot dogs are delicious and there is a wide variety of options. Consistent through all meal options is the quality of ingredients and the great skill with which they are executed.

I work at a higher-end restaurant and we serve amazing hand-cut fries.  I will say that the fries here were even better.  Furthermore they (the fries) were beautiful (strange to say about a French fry, but see for yourself)!
Heads up:  they are closed from 2:00-4:00.  Get this: they leave for the grocery store to replenish their stock, ensuring the ingredients are as fresh for the dinner rush as they are for the lunch crowd.  Certainly cuts into the owners&#39;profit margin to close during such a time, but I give them props for choosing quality over quantity.  Who does that, especially for a burger &amp; dog place?

Tonight is the third time in the last year that I tried and failed to get dinner! They do not keep true to their own posted operating hours.  Always closing early. Tonight I called at 7pm to order wings, he said it would be just a few min. I said oh it usually takes longer. I can&#39;t make it that quick. I asked if they could put the order in so that it was ready to be picked up around 745. He said no, we can&#39;t do that and then hung up on me as I was trying to say ok if call back in 30 min to order again.  So fast forward to 7:38 exactly I call again.  They won&#39;t answer the phone. I called about 5 times. Finally knowing they are going to close at 8 my husband runs over there to order in person....doors locked and lights off when he gets there at 745 which is still 15 min before they are supposed to be closed. I&#39;ve had this happen 3 times now!  I&#39;m sorry, but no food is worth that effort and it&#39;s just poor customer service. If you post you&#39;re open until 8, and your answering machine says your open until 8 you need to be open until 8. Or have a well posted disclaimer that says we close when we please because we don&#39;t care about our customers. My husband was in the parking lot at 745 listening to a message saying they are open for another 15 min.  Nice. The first time this happened I called 30 min before closing and the guy said they don&#39;t take orders that late.....I said I didn&#39;t understand because they were open for another 30 min. Apparently when it says they close at a certain time that&#39;s when they plan on walking out the door and has nothing to do with what time they will serve customers. You don&#39;t want my business, I understand. That&#39;s been made clear. I&#39;ll make sure to let anyone I can know not to waste their time checking Sams out anymore, I can&#39;t trust I wouldn&#39;t be making a jerk out of myself recommending."

The Hubs &amp; I stopped by intending to dine in but upon seeing how small it was decided to take it home.  We shared an order of Beer Nuggets and the Tandoori Chicken Paratha sandwich.  The sandwich comes already split in two so it made sharing easy and was enough to share especially with the addition of the Beer Nuggets.    The sandwich was well-seasoned &amp; quite tasty, spicy but not much heat.  The Beer Nuggets could have used some sort of seasoning in the dough as they seemed rather bland but the marinara sauce it came with for dipping was quite good and made up for it in the flavor department.  Our order was ready in 10 minutes.  They have quite a variety of sandwiches, burgers and 11 or 12 different wing sauces so if we&#39;re ever in the area again and wanting take out I&#39;d definitely try some more of their offerings."

Sam, the owner is a really nice guy who would always remember your name and possibly previous order(s) too. 
My husband is a vegetarian so we have tried mostly all vegetarian items here- My favorite would be the pao bhaji and for the fish tacos. For everything else that I tried I always find something missing- that would be the freshness. For example- the paneer tikka roll is served in a frozen parantha and that kind of changes the texture and taste of the whole tikka roll for me(chicken or paneer is actually good, it&#39;s just the bread I never liked).

Three months into our relationship and my family continues to work our way through their ever-changing menu. Lemme give you a few highlights...

Tandoori Chicken. On a pita. On a pizza. In a taco shell...no, not just any taco shell. It&#39;s like the best chalupa shell you&#39;ve ever had but sooo much better. I&#39;ll be honest here. The words &#39;tandoori chicken&#39; scared me at first. I&#39;m picky. I don&#39;t like new things. Except that&#39;s all a lie because every time I try something new at Sam&#39;s, I like it. Basically, tandoori chicken is well-seasoned chicken breast chunks. It&#39;s a little spicy. It&#39;s not &#34;burn-your-face-off-spicy&#34;, but rather, &#34;I-like-my-taste-buds-to-get-a-workout-spicy&#34;. The chicken breast chunks are fabulous and fresh!  They serve it with a homemade sauce that I&#39;ve tasted. It&#39;s good, but I am not a huge fan of dairy, so I get that on the side. The seasoning is not like something that I&#39;ve ever had before...and that&#39;s a good thing. It makes the chicken a bright orange color. I thought it was weird until I tasted it. Now, it&#39;s one of my new favorite foods. 

Speaking of favorite foods, have you tried paratha?  I did a couple weeks ago for the first time (under duress) and now I can&#39;t get enough!  This is a homemade gluten-free bread, like a flatbread made with wheat flour. I loved it plain!!!  I even liked it with sour cream and, as I mentioned, I&#39;m not a dairy fan.  Filled with tandoori chicken, it&#39;s waaaay too filling, but flavorful. I really like the flavors in the onion paratha best (so far).  Again, another thing that I never would have tried back in the day, but Sam, Rachel, Nick and the whole crew have yet to steer me wrong.

BBQ Saturday. It&#39;s a great day to eat at Sam&#39;s!  Try the ribs with the homemade sauce. Talk about finger lickin&#39; good!!!  I still have the BBQ beef sandwich on my list of things to try. Maybe next weekend?

We&#39;ve fallen head over heals for their hand packed burgers, the Bari Italian beef sandwiches and their gyros fresh off the spit. The fried taco is sooo bad, yet sooo good in all the right ways!  And when given a choice between their fresh cut fries and their beer nuggets (made from fresh pizza dough), we don&#39;t usually choose and we eat both. Shhh, don&#39;t tell.

So they&#39;ve added another table and a few more chairs which is good especially for the regulars. I&#39;m a proud regular. Us regulars like to stand around and chat like we&#39;re at Cheers...without the beer...and the bartenders...and we like to share our opinions on our favorite foods with the newbies who&#39;ve wandered in. Don&#39;t worry, they won&#39;t be newbies for long. Thus, the reason for more seating. Almost every time that I stop in, I see someone I&#39;ve seen there before and I usually meet someone new who wants to try what Sam&#39;s has to offer. I genuinely love coming in here! Don&#39;t get me wrong...it&#39;s really nothing to look at when it comes to decor. I know that I come back time and again for the tasty food, the great company and the exceptional service. It&#39;s a true hometown eatery that&#39;s growing every day. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they expanded to offer a comfortable dine-in experience for their growing number of clientele one of these days. 

Stop in and try something new. You&#39;ll be glad you did."

I had the burger and I really enjoyed it.  My husband had the really hot wings (he is a true spicy foods lover) and he was able to finish the 6 wings. The employee told him that they do challenges on Fridays for the wings. I have a feeling my husband will be going to one very soon.  

The only negative- just like the other reviewer said, they also forgot our chili. :(."

As always, Sam was happy to see me!  Noticed a few new things since the New Year.  Sam put up an abbreviated menu of some of his more popular Indian dishes (he&#39;s always made them, just never advertised them).

I got my regular Royal Burger with Jalapeno added (you gotta try this--it&#39;s amazing!).  As always, it was delicious.  I also noticed that he had a 2pc chicken tandoori paratha on his new Indian menu.  I figured what the hell, and went ahead and ordered it.  I&#39;ve never had paratha before, but this was INCREDIBLE.  

Sam was very excited to describe it to me, and from what I gathered, it&#39;s essentially a pita that is cooked with egg batter.  It made it very flaky and flavorful--honestly similar to an egg-roll type of flavor and texture.  Mixed with the already amazing tandoori chicken, it was phenomenal.  

Keeping with tradition, the portion size was also very generous for the price.  

Sam also let me sample his new Hawaiian style spicy pineapple sauce.  I haven&#39;t decided what this is going to be best on, but I think it&#39;s my favorite sauce of his so far.

5/5 as always.  If you&#39;re not eating here yet, you&#39;re making a mistake!"

I finally made it in today and it definitely was all worth the hype. I had the fried taco which was out of this world, and my girlfriend had the jalapeño burger which was also excellent. Ruben one of the owners was very nice and during my visit made us a fried strawberry Twinkie which wow is all I have to say. This restaurant has a great selection at outstanding prices. Not to mention the owners Sam, Ruben, and the rest of the family are extremely hospitable, knowledgeable and are the definition of what customer service is all about. Will most definitely be back."

Enter in Sam&#39;s Grill.

This is a little restaurant located in a little strip in Bartlett (close to Hanover Park).  It is a little difficult to find--especially in the dark--and it just says PIZZA on the roof of the building, not their actual name.  So be on the lookout!!

There are about five seats in this place TOTAL so take-out is probably best!

Anyway, the service here is PHENOMENAL.  I wish there were more stars I could give this place just based on the service and friendliness of the staff alone.  The food was just as good, but I love a place that has a friendly staff and appreciates your business.  You could just tell they were grateful to have the business from the moment we walked in.

OK, so here is what we originally ordered (to be split among three of us)
12 Hell Raiser Wings (for the husband)
Fries
Gyro Dinner
Italian Beef Sandwich
Loaded Cheese Fries
Cup of Chili

Now after we had ordered that, the nice man behind the counter, Nick, brought it to our attention that nobody has made it through 5 of those wings and offered us a taste to MAKE SURE that&#39;s what he wanted (after a burning throat and watering eyes, we determined that NOBODY would enjoy that).  So they made him a spicy buffalo sauce that wasn&#39;t even on the menu.  Talk about service!

But other than that, he was really sweet answering all of our questions and after they saw our burning mouths (yikes), a really sweet guy from the back brought out bread with cinnamon, sugar, and honey on it to calm our palates.  How sweet (literally!)

All of the food was really, really good, too.  There was nothing I was eating that I was thinking &#34;I could use some _____&#34; or &#34;I wish it had _____&#34;.  It was all very, very good!!

My only complaint is that they forgot my chili :(  I didn&#39;t realize it until I got home, so I didn&#39;t want to go back.  But honestly, I am more upset about the fact that I missed out on trying some bomb-ass chili (and I know the chili will be amazing if my loaded fries are any indication!!).

So I can&#39;t wait to go back...and try the chili. :)

(NOTE: They don&#39;t have a menu online, but I uploaded pictures.  I recommend calling ahead since they make everything fresh.  There is also a menu on Facebook on their company page)"

I took a lunch group from work over there to try it out. The menu is written in chalk on a giant chalkboard, ordered by a giant grid that&#39;s about 10 cells tall by 5 cells wide. It&#39;s not the most readable menu out there, so I scanned the paper menu instead.

I ended up getting a Gyro Burger with fries and a drink. I loved the fries... freshly deep fried russets with a good coating of salt. Not greasy at all! The burger itself was excellent. It consisted of a soft bun around a beef patty, shaved lamb (!), lightly grilled onion, tomato and tzatziki sauce. I liked every bit of it.

Really, what tips this from 4.5 stars to 5 is Sam, who clearly has a passion for good food, chatting up the customers, and chicken wings served with ghost chili-enhanced hot sauce. (He kindly provided a sample: Yowsa-hot, but very good. Same deal with the mango habañero!)

So the next time I&#39;m here, I&#39;ll be getting the wings. Consider ordering in advance, since everything is made fresh, and we ended up standing around for 30 minutes while everyone&#39;s food finished. But trust me; it&#39;s worth the wait."

The pita, the prarthana, and yes even the chicken tandoori pizza.  Sams teases with some of the spices and flavors of India on the foundation of the All American Diner.  The combination is WIN!  

I think the name &#34;Sam&#39;s Grill&#34; is a misnomer that evokes the standard hot dogs, burgers and gyros.  Though I would pass by it daily, I had not gone into this place for years thinking it was just another dog &amp; burger joint.  Chicagoland is nothing if not overwhelmed by tons of top notch dog &amp; burger joints already.  

I was astonished to find something so unique and unsuspecting hidden in such a inconspicuous location.  After all, it is small and in an off the beaten path strip mall.  It&#39;s really for pickup &amp; take out as the front doesn&#39;t lend itself to sit down dining.  Although he does have a couple chairs and a stool perched against the wall that is carpet bombed by local merchants business cards and flyers.

The owner and son are very friendly, conversant, and seem to truly appreciate my business.  Though I wouldn&#39;t engage much idle chat during lunch rush.  They do have a steady business to run and the staff is small.

The fusion of flavors I found in this place sets this guy apart from everyone else.  Sam&#39;s Grill delivers on an unusual blend of oddly addictive Indian flavors and spices with traditional American and Greek foods.

I was stunned at how good my first chicken tandoori pita was and it keeps me coming back for more.  I&#39;ve now taken it on as a personal challenge to go down the list of Indian fusion creations Sam&#39;s has to offer and look forward to more creations.  This flavor is unique, weird, delicious, addictive and something I can&#39;t even describe.

I would recommend this to anyone that may think they do not like Indian food due to a bad experience with something a little &#34;too authentic.&#34;  Or perhaps to someone that has an interest and wants to try new Indian flavors but might be intimidated or confused by a completely alien menu at an authentic Indian restaurant that may be a bit much. 
 
I wish for nothing but big success to these guys and hope they expand to another couple more locations soon."

I ordered well ahead of time and was told that it would be 25 minutes.  I get to the place 32.7 minutes later and was told just &#34;5&#34; more minutes before your order is ready...Sure... I ended up waiting another 15 minutes in the shop as the main guy dillywag with his friend.

No apology, no nothing...that kind of irked me, since it was apparent how much bs his estimate of time was.

Anyways, I ordered the chicken tandoori pizza and wings (buffalo/lemon pepper).

Was not that impressed by the pizza.  Indeed, the crust was...fantastic...not sure how to describe it other than pita-ish.  However, the toppings and sauce was meh.  Confuzzle as to why other yelpers raved madly regarding the pizza when it was...alright.

The wings definitely had an awesome crispy texture, but there is a BUT.  Buffalo sauce was leaning too far on the sour side to the point where I would describe that even BDUBs sauce is better.

Lemon Pepper version though was perfect, so I would recommend the wings definitely, albeit, with a different sauce/seasoning other than buffalo."

This is a family owned business...Owners are so friendly and after talking with them for few minutes...I can tell they are very passionate about their food and quality..

1) Friench fries with their secret sauce - they are so crispy and goes good with the sauce....these fries are best in town..not exaggerating...
2) Lemon Pepper wings - wowwwwwwwwww...no words to explain and their garlic sauce along with it...never tasted so good anywhere else till now.
3) Tandoor panner on pita - awesome ..paneer is so fresh, tasty and done with right mix of spices.

First off Sam is a rockstar, makes you really feel like he is making the food for love not for money. 

ok lets start

1.) I had there hottest wings ( forgot the name) I eat spicy but those kicked me in the a$$... but not just heat great taste. 

2.) Pau Bhaji &amp; Pau Bhaji Pizza.. I have been to mumbai 4 times in 2 years and Pav Bhaji might be one of my top 3 street foods, and Sams makes it like Bombay, plus at only 6 dollars a plate. I highly recommend it

3.) Tandoori Chicken Pita or Pizza ... Nothing to say here as a restaurant fanatic I have had Tandoori chicken at every restaurant in 30 miles probably and frankly the 15 dollar plates cant touch his 6 dollar pita , perfectly marinated and just tasty. 

4.) Paneer Roll.... First off this is not paneer you get anywhere you cant buy it , this is proper indian paneer dense and just amazing, I got it spicy and it had just the right amount of burn. 

Sam laughs that he has met half my family cause they have all come in with my recommendation, and not one has told me I was wrong. Our family chef has said his Pav Bhaji is the best she has had outside of Bombay ! 


Thank god for this place."

sams-grill-and-pizza-bartlett,Dan B.,3JEwItoTcx_gWjuFAn2TMg,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,1,1,459,14,dapaO6IxPE0p0-kVlLTldw,4.0,2012-12-19,"Having seen a number of Yelp reviews with outstanding feedback of Sam&#39;s Grill &amp; Pizza, I decided to take the risk and make the journey out from my office to Bartlett to pick up some food here on my lunch break. In looking over their options, I saw they had a Chicago style hot dog and knew I had to give this place a try. They have a fairly diverse menu with lots of different kinds of burgers, hot dogs, alongside pizza, wings and other common to these kinds of establishment menu items like Gyros and Italian beef sandwiches. 

Sam&#39;s is located in a small heavily deserted strip mall off of Prospect avenue in Bartlett. When you walk in there&#39;s a long counter, a cooler with various types of beverages to your right. And a big menu board on the wall to your left. There&#39;s a few tables and a counter if you were to eat in the restaurant itself. A while after stopping in (more on this later) I was ready to leave with the food ordered for myself and my co-workers.

On to the review of the food itself. The hot dog I received came on a Chicago-style poppy seed bun. The bun didn&#39;t seem to be steamed, but was soft and showed no signs of dryness. There was a thinly sliced pickle on top of the dog, this pickle slice was a bit more sour than I would like, but certainly didn&#39;t taint the flavor of the hot dog. There were two long sport peppers perfectly placed on top so that sport pepper could be had in every bite. The peppers were a good balance of being not too hot and providing the right amount of flavor. The tomato on this hot dog was a bit of a downer, it was slightly soggy and didn&#39;t cover the entire length of the hot dog. The big problem with this hot dog was the relish, it wasn&#39;t the brand, it was the amount. There was around 2 dogs worth of relish on this hot dog. As a result the relish flavor was the dominant taste here. It overpowered both the mustard and what onion was on the hot dog. As for the sausage itself, it was a skinless dog, it was properly steamed and prepared. There was some celery salt on the dog, but its flavor was again, overpowered by the excessive relish. Overall, this wasn&#39;t a bad hot dog, but it was definitely a bit unbalanced.

The final subject to note on Sam&#39;s is the time it took for the order to be ready, Between myself and my co-workers there were two burgers, a hot dog, and fries for the two burgers that needed to be made. This took around a half hour from when I placed the phone call to when the food was ready a ways after I arrived. Overall I liked the food and might be back, but for the investment of time it took for my food to be ready I wouldn&#39;t say this is quite a five star establishment. I give Sam&#39;s Grill &amp; Pizza four stars. My opinion on this establishment can best be summed up in the following rhyme.

Good, but not great and be prepared to wait."

I ordered the gyro burger, and it was huge, and as good as any burger I could have made at home.  They use fresh beef in their burgers.  The fresh-cut fries were also great.  I&#39;m looking forward to working my way through their menu."

I have lived in Bartlett for 6 years and I just found this amazing family owned place. Let me just tell you that the owners are such amazingly nice people that I would make it a regular stop just for that. But, the food is out of this world, my wife had the bacon cheeseburger with the beernuggets and some fries, let me tell you that I have never seen her eat her food sooooo fast because it was soooo good. I had a Coney dog, even though it had beans and in my eyes a true Coney dog has no beans, but the sun stated it was a Jersey Coney not Detroit, the Coney was delicious. Then I had the tandoori chicken and it was out of this world. When you get it on a pita with lettuce, onions, tomatoes and their homemade sauce it rocks your taste buds to a new level. One more thing, their BBQ sauce was some of the best I have ever had, we were licking the cup for the last drop. Come from near to far and try out this epic family run restaurant!!!!!! Thank you Sam and family!!!"

I gotta say I agree with the other people -- the place doesn&#39;t have any curb appeal and looks rather beat down from the street.  Not exactly appetizing to look at, but we were desperate for a new food place near us and you can only eat so much TL&#39;s.  Anyway, glad we went in!!!!  First, Sam has got to be our new favorite person in the world.  Talk about personable. This guy is so animated and friendly; he&#39;s got to be the nicest person in the world.  No, I mean it.  Literally.  Secondly, for all his gushing about his food, he wasn&#39;t lying.  We played it safe by ordering a few burgers, wings and loaded fries since it was our first time here, but man was it delicious.  Sometimes a good burger just really hits the spot.  We are definitely excited to try all the other varied foods on the menu now, especially given what we just ate and all the other reviews on here. A+ on food, and A++++++ on service.  We finished our food 15 minutes ago, and I am on here writing a review (which you can check, I rarely do).  That&#39;s how much I wanted to take a minute and give this guy the praise he deserves."

I was offered a medium 1topping pizza for special $10 and also asked to add another extra topping which they gladly did and just charged for the extra topping and very kindly accepted my order.  Not like other places where they do not like to bend ways for the customer. 

The owners Sam and his wife a extremely great couple and are great people to talk to.  

They made my pizza fresh and only after the order. So do expect a little extra waiting time for your awesome pizza to get ready, it&#39;s worth the wait.  And when you have to wait for the food you know it&#39;s getting made fresh from scratch. 

I will definitely be going there again. It&#39;s a nice local joint for pizza."

The food and service were very good, portions large, the prices reasonable for the quality of the food and included all the sides.

I ended up having the pork chops this time, and they were pretty good (juicy, but not very flavorful). The portion size is always more than one person can eat in a serving - everyone at the table had a take home box.
The wait staff was below average though; there was only one other table occupied in the entire restaurant (since we went at around 3), and the waiter only came once the entire meal, so our cups were empty most of the time."

My father and I decided to stop in one evening for a early dinner. We were seated immediately and ordered a cold one. We frequent this establishment often, so we both knew exactly what we wanted. 

We both ordered the 16oz ribeye steak dinner. Now, this steakhouse includes so much with your meal. There&#39;s no ala cart games here. Your dinner comes with a soup, salad, potato of your choice, and a veggie of your choice. A real value for under $30! 

I ordered my 16oz ribeye with the baked French onion soup, the dinner salad, mashed potatoes, and zucchini. A feast that is sure to satisfy the hungriest of patrons. 
The Baked French onion soup here is truly a meal. An overflowing bowl with tons of onions, croutons, and melty gruyere cheese! It is hands down the best soup in the area! 

Now onto the juicy, tender steak. Here, they truly cook it medium rare. I&#39;m talking pink with tons of juice all over your plate. I ordered mine with the blue cheese &#34;crust&#34;. The steak was cooked to perfection, nice and juicy. The mashed potatoes were smooth and piping hot. The zucchini was tender and brushed with plenty of butter! 

The service throughout the meal was exceptional. My glass never ran dry and anything I requested was delivered to the table immediately. Their fresh baked bread is excellent and baked to perfection. 

If you&#39;re looking for the best steak in the area, look no further. Jameson&#39;s is the place to cure your meat craving! 

However, be careful visiting on the weekends, as it&#39;s extremely busy. I recommend a reservation. Also, parking is a hassle, as the lot is extremely small. They usually have valet on hand to alleviate that issue. Check it out, you&#39;ll be coming back for more!"

The two chicken breast were huge and moist, with a ton of flavor.  And to make it even better, the price  of the dish was under $15.

The restaurant was crowded, but we had reservations, so no worries.  Seated, they brought us 5 minutes... and we didn&#39;t get the kid&#39;s menu until the server arrived.  No worries.

Pleasant service, no complaints there, or with the ambience... even crowded it wasn&#39;t loud.

Ordered our food and quickly got our soups.  Two to choose from, all went with the chicken noodle.  Only complaint I have there is that there was barely any chicken, the broth was very good though, so the soup was a mostly win.

Salad, simple, nothing spectacular.

Dinner:  child #1 got a filet and loved it; child #2 got a black and blue burger and enjoyed it; child #3 got a burger with no complaints; husband ordered ribeye and enjoyed it but felt it was a little fatty; I ordered a NY Strip and it was good, but I had a similar issue with fat on mine.  Veggies were perfectly cooked, all around.

Dessert: cheese cake and tiramisu... both were wonderful!

Dinner was very good, better than we get at a cheap, chain steakhouse, and for 5 of us, it didn&#39;t really break the bank.  We will go back."

When the server brought the sole to the table they proceeded to debone the fish at the table. During this process the fish was cut into 3 small pieces and the almondine was removed from the fish. I complained to the waitress and she had the owner come to my table . After I explained my disappoint to him about my order, he graciously had my dinner remade and served me what I wanted.

First, we showed up between 5-10 minutes early for our 7:15 reservation and were told &#34;we&#39;ll seat you as soon as we can.&#34; While waiting we were treated to the bickering between the bartender and one of the waitresses as well as the constant complaining from the host (manager?) and hostess. After waiting for 25 minutes feeling like I was at the rental car desk in Seinfeld (&#34;Anyone can take a reservation...&#34;), I pointed out to the hostess out that our reservation was for 25 minutes ago and the hostess rudely explained something about other people checking in first so they get seated first. Aa side note, the place could use a revolving door at the entrance as every time someone came in or out the waiting area became a wind tunnel.

After expressing my displeasure, we were seated within 5 minutes so a total wait time after arriving at the restaurant of about 35 minutes. Walk-ins were being seated in about 40 minutes.

After being seated things got better. Our waitress, Jenny, was cheerful and helpful and attentive. We had a glass of wine and a cocktail while waiting for our meals. The wine was a generous pour and the Knob Creek Old Fashioned was well made. The food was fine. Not really worth going into detail about other than it&#39;s very reasonably priced and it comes with all the accoutrements. Very good value.

I decided to order the Alaskan halibut special. And the only thing special about it was that it gave me a nice, humbling experience with food poisoning for the next two days.
 
Our soup was a bit cold, the service was slow, and my girlfriend&#39;s chicken was undercooked.

Excellent vibe for a steakhouse. Their team was working together properly helping one another out on orders for the customers.

Minimum wait for our table and the staff was cheery. We ordered our drinks and dinners, stuffed chick breast w spinach/feta cheese for her and I got the 38 oz Prime Rib. Soup and salad came with the meals and were good. The soup was tortelloni in a clear chick broth. Our drinks were good, the wife got moscato which was cool not cold and actually had to take ice cubes from her water to put in the wine.

My wife&#39;s chick dish was delish, she said and my ribeye was great although I was unsure if it was a sirloin or prime rib since I could not see the center piece of fat that the cut traditionally has and virtually no bone. I realize that I was fortunate enough not to get the huge bone since it was supposed to be bone-in. It was charred nicely, had great taste and great texture, not too chewy.

The waitress was great and attentive and I can see why this place is hopping compared to the Skokie location which was a library. We were very happy."

Portions are huge, including the soup. I think soup AND salad are included. Generous to a fault. Seafood sounds just as inviting. This is now on the list for visiting the burbs. I&#39;d recommend coming here as early as possible, fills up fast for good reason."

The pieces were cut very large and they were not tender, they were very chewy. We both ordered the French onion soup which also was a disappointment. There was no cheese melted on top, just some powdered parmesan on top of a slice of a baguette. The broth did not have much flavor at all besides the salt and the onions were not cooked till tender. The dinner salad was of normal size but only contained lettuce and one small grape tomato that still had the stem attached and was over ripe and quite squishy to the touch. I ordered the 14oz prime rib which was just average. It was served with 3 asparagus spears and the run of the mill baked potato. My husband ordered the 24oz porterhouse and was served the 16oz New york strip instead. Questioned the waiter who said that the weight is before cooking, the Manager then came and said it was the wrong steak served and offered to remake the correct one. We were not offered any discount or compensation for their mistake."

I&#39;m from the south so I&#39;m quite picky. 
Mediocre to poor. They were frozen and reconstituted. The hollandaise was pitiful. 
Had a lemon drop martini which was ok. 
I was sitting at the bar. And the seafood odor was wafting and almost unbearable. 
Really was wanting the walleye. But after a guest was unhappy about her ribeye I lost my appetite. 
Orderded a bacon blue cheesburger to go. 
It was. Horrible.

All we had to do was sit and order.....  The service was amazing, there was always a server there to help out.  The food was excellent, the choices that were offered to us worked out extremely well, everyone loved the food, they all raved about the different entrees that were offered with the hot toasty bread.

Poor service,  unfriendly servers, incorrect orders, incorrect food descriptions. 

Upon arrival, the hostesses at the front seemed confused and bored (on a Saturday night). Our server did not greet us, just took a quick drink order, which was botched. 

He didn&#39;t explain the specials, took almost 20 minutes to come back and take our dinner order, at that point we were so hungry we skipped the appetizers (that we would ave ordered had he come back sooner.) i had questions about the menu, as i have a food allergy, my tilapia entree choice was explained incorrectly, and when it came out it was coated in a spicy lobster sauce which the server never mentioned (even though i specifically asked how it was prepared (before I ordered) and told him I could not eat anything spicy or containing peppers) the menu did not mention this sauce, and neither did my server when i asked him.....

When we got our dinners, three other folks in our group received incorrect entrees. II did not bother sending my entree back, I didn&#39;t want the delay, and our server seemed very flustered throughout the evening (1 server for a table of 14!) He completely ignored us after our entrees arrived. 

At one point I could see a gentlemen in a shirt and tie casually going from table to table, chatting with patrons. &#34;Oh good&#34; i thought, &#34;a manager, maybe he&#39;ll get our refills since our server does not care that over half of us have empty glasses and we are in the middle of dinner!&#34; Nope. He glanced over at our group (table of 14! You&#39;d think he&#39;d check on us) but no, he glanced over, then walked away. 

Finally our server came back and brought the check, didn&#39;t offer or encourage desserts, coffee, etc. Nada. Thank goodness the chicken soup (which was tasty) and little salad was edible for me. 

Overall poor service &amp; poorly staffed. Having been a server myself in my teens and 20&#39;s, i know it can be stressful... But i also know an uncaring, over worked, understaffed restaurant when i see one. I&#39;ll keep going to the Jamesons in Bloomingdale though, much much better service!"

Pros:
-The food has always been absolutely delicious.  It doesn&#39;t matter what we&#39;ve ordered it&#39;s darn good.
-Their specials menu is quite extensive, in addition to their regular menu.  There is something for everyone.
-All entrees come with both soup &amp; salad and they put a loaf of warm bread and butter on the table.
-They have a range of price points so you don&#39;t have to break the bank to eat good here.
-My favorite meal here is the Pork Chops because you get 2 huge thick chops along with all the other sides an entree comes with (soup, salad, potato &amp; veggie) all for $16.95.  This typically ends up being 2 - 3 meals for me.
-Love the decor &amp; atmosphere...kind of like an old-school supper club.
-The service has always been good on the many occasions we&#39;ve dined here.
-It&#39;s not loud in here!  You can actually have a conversation with the people at your table and not have to yell.

Cons:
-If it&#39;s cold outside &amp; you are seated next to a window, you will be cold.  Pick a different seat.  The last time this happened I had to use my jacket as a blanket (I didn&#39;t want to make our whole group move just because I was by the window).
-When I make a reservation, I do not want to be offered to sit in the lounge/bar area.  Yes, they do have booths over there, but it&#39;s still the bar area with several televisions.  The host did ask if it was okay to be seated there, so if you don&#39;t want to sit over there, then just say so.
-Their plating can be a bit cumbersome.  My favorite chops meal comes with the pork chops on one plate, the mashed potatoes on another small plate and then my veggies on another big plate.  Uh, there is not enough room on the table for multiple people to have all those plates.  Either get bigger plates or at least put the veggies on the plate with the meat.  As soon as they bring the food I do this and hand the server back the veggie plate.  Even Busia&#39;s crab cake &amp; fried shrimp came with her french fries on a separate small plate when there was plenty of room on the plate with the entree.
-Their French Onion soup is not the baked kind with the melted Gruyere/Swiss on top.  The soup itself was very tasty, but I wasn&#39;t a fan of the toasted croutons on top that were topped with powdered Parmesan cheese."

We started with a fried calamari appetizer and the calamari did not seem fresh.  The calamari was chewy and cut into large pieces which made it difficult to eat.

The steaks were not very flavorful and all of them were overcooked and dry.  Three of us ordered the sirloin, I ordered the larger size thinking I would bring the leftovers for lunch the next day, but when the steaks came out they all looked the same size.  The three sirloins were all pretty gristly and I spent a lot of time cutting out the fat.  I know it comes with a lot of food- soup, salad and potato- but the quality of the food is not that good.  The sign outside the restaurant says that they were voted the best steakhouse and I want to know who voted on that one!  I would definitely choose Outback Steakhouse over Jameson&#39;s."

I made a reservation(mentioned that it was a special occasion) but called and changed the time(mentioned again that it was a special day) as we were running late--no problem I was told.  Arrived and fought through the crowd to get to the hostess and was told you are 20 minutes late give us some time--are you kidding--I called!!  Didn&#39;t want to make a scene and upset mom so let that slide.  Didn&#39;t have to wait long, but really could have done without the attitude.Seriously, what a first impression.

Server was really nice and good.  She brought drinks and bread right away took our order for an appetizer which arrived quickly (calamari) and returned at the appropriate time to take the orders.

Entrees come with soup,salad, potato and vegetable.  Soup was so salty, salad dressing (Greek house) had way too much vinegar, sirloin came out overdone and the vegetable (broccoli) was barely steamed it was much closer to raw.

When the server asked if we wanted dessert or coffee I AGAIN mentioned that it was a special occasion and we just wanted or order a piece of cake so we could sing to mom.   It isn&#39;t like we hadn&#39;t mentioned it before and I also inquired when I called if they had birthday cakes to purchase and was told not to worry they sent a dessert for birthdays.  

This place was packed (it was a Saturday) but I am guessing it is because they give you alot of food and was reasonably priced, but I&#39;ll find another place for next year."

But when I drop $100 for dinner for two, I at least expect a cloth tablecloth, not a wooden tabletop, like I&#39;d get at Brnaby&#39;s pub. The soup was outstanding, but the ribeye steak was very average, fatty and not trimmed well. Then a guy comes in and sits at the bar near us, and starts talking real loud, spouting off about his narrow political views, and dropping F-bombs all over the place. Worse, he was talking to the bartender, who seemed to enjoy the conversation. It definitely put the atmosphere of the whole place in the toilet. Some people just don&#39;t know what class is.

I apologize for that. This review is for the Arlington heights location. Tried to have dinner last night but the evening was a disaster. Started with walking  into the restaurant and saw someone outside smoking. Walked in and sat at the bar and waited patiently for someone to greet us. Waited close to 10 minutes and then the bartender very casually said you guys need anything? Being greeted would have been nice. Oh and the bartender was the guy we saw smoking on our way in. Yuk! There was also a pile of dirty dishes and glasses on the bar. Got our drinks and after that things continued to go south. Ordered an appetizer and after we ordered our dinner, 20 minutes later the cook came out to let the bartender know they were out of walleye. We decided to just share the steak we ordered because it was getting late and we were hungry AND we had already been there quite some time. 20 additional minutes go by and we now tell the bartender to forget about our steak. We need our bill and want to leave. The manager comes out and begs us to &#34;please don&#39;t do this to us&#34;.  We were not the only guests having trouble getting their food. We overheard several other guests wondering what was taking so long. $50 later we had a couple drinks and calamari. We are good customers and like Jameson&#39;s but we will not return to this location.  Note to management learn from this experience. Pay attention to what is going on in your restaurant.  Lack of awareness and the guests feel like no one cares.  Why should we spend money where no one cares. There are many other options for a nice place to have a steak.

Don&#39;t mess around with ordering an extra crust or topping. It doesn&#39;t need it and takes away from the flavor. YOU MUST ORDER THIS STEAK. I have also had the filet which is very flavorful as well! Better then any other steakhouse around for the price. 

Fish - They always have fresh fish specials. They have many different fish dishes to choose from and I have tried most of them. They are always fresh, flakey, not fishy at all, and delicious! They do their fish as good as they do their steaks.

You get Soup AND Salad with your entree! (AND warm Bread) We love that you get both. If you get the house french onion soup, you have to order it with the melted cheese on top which is like an extra $3 but totally worth it. The other soups have been good as well. The salad is a good portion size and the house dressing is very good.

Appetizer - The stuffed mushrooms with spinach and hollandaise sauce are my favorite. Although, we usually only order an appetizer if there are 4 of more people in our group, otherwise it is just too much food.

The Drinks do not disappoint. They don&#39;t give you a little splash of alcohol, they give you a good amount! You get your moneys worth on the cocktails! Martinis are also very good.

The atmosphere is pretty quiet and relaxing. We usually sit in a booth in the bar area because we like the bar atmosphere, but it is very nice, calm, and relaxing.

The Con&#39;s:

The atmosphere consists of an older crowd. For whatever reason, not a lot of younger people come here. They are missing out! I don&#39;t really mind that it&#39;s an older crowd, just something to be aware of. 

If you come on a weekend night without a reservation, expect a little wait. Never anything too bad and usually seats at the bar to wait. I would suggest making a reservation if you have more then 2-3.

The interior could use an update. Looks a little older and outdated. 

TIP-  you must go to this location! I have been to other locations and they aren&#39;t as good. And come hungry! very hungry....."

My family and I went to this location on Sunday, 7/5. I called ahead to make sure they had medium rare prime rib. Michelle told me to hold on so she could check. She came back and told me they did and I said we were on our way. Upon arriving we were seated promptly. Even though the restaurant was not crowded at all, the service was very slow. Good soup and good salad, but oh my when the prime ribs arrived that my husband and son ordered, I about jumped out of my skin. They were not medium rare, not pink at all and actually looked dry (obviously leftovers from Saturday 7/4), without even tasting I could tell! I immediately mentioned to the waitress that the prime rib were not medium rare, she said that is all we have. Wrong answer, because I explained I had called ahead to ask, was told they had it, and we ordered medium rare. If there was a problem why weren&#39;t we informed immediately when order was placed. I asked to speak to manager and he came to table and explained that he understands that I had called, but realized after they did not have medium rare. He literally laughed about it, and when I said I don&#39;t find this funny, he apologized. He never offered to accommodate in any other way. So I told him to take 50% off the two prime ribs. Worst prime rib my guys have ever had. I knew there was a reason we stopped going to this location!!!!! After asking waitress for the check, she told me manager would like to give us dessert, but not adjust the bill. We declined the dessert and demanded the adjustment on the bill. Tipped waitress actual amount due to her for full charges, but overall a very unpleasant experience. Never, ever going back!!! For excellent prime rib, drive a little further to Jameson&#39;s in Arlington Heights on Dundee. The very best! At least they had the courtesy to tell me over the phone they ran out."

We split a batch of spinch artichoke dip, which was OK. The chips they brought were obviously fresh out of the fryer and made from fresh white corn tortillas... so bravo on that.
I had mediocre cream of mushroom soup.
Then I had an OK mix of cajun spiced pan fried [not battered] fish. Some of the pieces were way overcooked. The overall taste was fine.
The side of grilled asparagus was awesome... but only 3 spears.
The fresh bread they bring out is really delicious.

Service was good. Our service understood English, but I am still not sure he spoke it!"

I brought my boyfriend there last week after arriving back in town, and I am so happy after all these years, the same owners are still doing a fantastic job.

Steaks have always been great! My favorite, however, was always the chicken ceasar salad. Since we were craving and smelling steak from the parking lot, we ordered the ceasar salad with sirloin in place of chicken. Excellent! For dessert, they offer some sort of sundae. They call it a gold nouggat sundae or something like that. The ice cream is very good, but the kicker is the chocolate they pour over it. The chocolate sauce has nuts in it and forms a hard shell. I love it! Then they put the whipped cream and cherry on top. It rocks!

The menu is so reasonably priced. They are not afraid to feed you there at all. The most impressive about this restaurant is the cleanliness. We were finishing our dinner as the kitchen closed, but the bar stayed open. They have an open kitchen, so you can see them clean the kitchen very thoroughly. It was distracting how thoroughly because I could not believe the attention to detail the employees gave to every nook and cranny near the food area. Great place."

Server was competent and somewhat knowledgeable.  Drinks were delivered in a timely fashion and the wine was comparable to an establishment of this size.

Decor was sort of mediocre.  Place could definitely use a face lift.  The dinnerware wasn&#39;t classy or upscale, but again, was what you could expect from a restaurant like this.  The lights over the tables did look slightly newer, and were appealing. 

The food was decent albeit a tad disappointing.  The Cream of Chicken Rice was hot when delivered, but lacking in the actual amount of chicken in it.  The bread was also hot when the server delivered it and didn&#39;t appear or taste like it was old or from frozen.  Our table ordered two steaks, two sandwiches, and a chicken parmesan.  The steaks were of correct size and cooked correctly to temperature.  The sandwiches looked, appetizing as well.  The presentation was okay. not bad but not something I would write the pope about.  The Chicken Parmesan was... perplexing.  It was grilled, not breaded or any sort of coating to it.  There also wasn&#39;t any parmesan cheese on it, just mozzarella than had been browned and tossed on pasta.  Overall, as I stated before, pretty average."

My father is handicapped and we made reservations for Easter Brunch and specifically requested a TABLE to accommodate this.  We got to the restaurant on time and the hostess sat us at a booth.  I told her we requested a table and she said sorry they did not have any tables available.  The restaurant was nearly empty, as it just opened and I understand the lunch rush was soon, but she did not even try accommodating his handicap.   They tried to pull the booth chair out and had to get bus boys and it was extremely embarrassing, especially since they messed up on their part.  The booth didn&#39;t move and what was their resolution?!  THEY SAT US AT A DIFFERENT BOOTH.  I am absolutely appalled at the lack of empathy for a handicapped patron.  My father was embarrassed so he left it drop and sat the entire meal uncomfortable, in pain and squished.  The manager came over and did not do anything.  Did not offer any compensation.  Completely insensitive.  Will never be coming here again.  If you or anyone you know is handicapped, don&#39;t bother coming here."

The quantities were huge which for me generally indicates a lack of quality. The lobster tail was decent but also a bit over cooked. Being an American steakhouse there was no attention at all to presentation. The drink I ordered was unknown to the bartender who sent the ingredients to my table for me to mix! (Communard or Red Kir). Unlike the other dinners here, I found the Calamari to be excellent. They were fresh and large cut but not breaded or deep fried, very similar to Portugal or Greece. Perhaps the other reviewer were expecting fast food type calamari."

What made this review bad was the service and it left a bad tast in our dining experience. We were there for lunch. Our server was just awful. It&#39;s either she was having a bad day or she&#39;s new. Either way it didn&#39;t make for a good experience. She didn&#39;t introduce herself..just came to the table to drop off the menus and left. She didn&#39;t even bother to ask us if we wanted anything to drink before anything. She came to the table and stood there waiting for our order. When we placed our order for appetizers and a kids meal to start, again she just left without clarifying any of the orders. When the appetizers came and the kids pizza we had to ask her whether the kids meal came with a drink and of course it did. We had to ask her what kind of drinks do they have for kids and her response was &#34;we have Coke or Diet Coke which one do you want.&#34; Really!! I asked her whether they have juice or milk and she said &#34;we don&#39;t have juice but we have milk would you like some milk.&#34; After we made our main order we had soups and salads after the appetizer....again not even bothering to ask us what drinks we might like aside from the water on the table! We finished our soups and salads and had empty plates from the appetizers, soups and salads on our table she didn&#39;t  even bother to come and clean those up. I had to flag her and ask her if she can clean our table which she did except for one empty salad plate. After our meal was done she didn&#39;t even ask us whether we want any desserts. The server just did not show any interest in serving us a nice meal from start to finish. Oh and when we&#39;re about ready to go that&#39;s when she came by and dropped off a chocolate chip cookie for my daughter for her kids meal...we were leaving! My daughter has been done with her food for a while now if she bothered to check on us. Average food with awful service equals bad experience...unfortunately this is what we had."

It fills a much needed niche between the boring, unimaginable national chains like Outback /Texas Roadhouse and the over-the-top priced downtown steakhouses.

I&#39;ve eaten at the Mt. Prospect location a few times and never left hungry, broke or disappointed.  My steaks were always prepared as ordered and were very flavorful and tender.  Jameson&#39;s definitely uses a much high quality of meat than the national chains so you&#39;re sure to get a better steak!

You don&#39;t have to take my word for it.  The number of people in the waiting area for a table tell you many others feel the same way.

The quality of the food here is always consistent and the prices are reasonable as well. Atmosphere is good, surrounded with crusty people who have probably been eating here since it opened.

Nonetheless, I have no complaints, but a few observations:

1. Lunchtime is busy, and parking can be hard to find, but inside is easy to get accomodated.
2. The seafood combo isn&#39;t really a combo. It has one primary seafood ingredient (chef&#39;s choice), but it *may* contain leftovers from what didn&#39;t sell the previous day (other sorts of seafood).
3. Everyone at the table will not get a specials menu. If you have two people, you get one. If you have four people, you may get two or three."

I had a blackened mahi mahi sandwich or something along those lines, that was really darn good. Nice soft roll and good flavor on the fish with some actual fish flavor instead of just spice overload.

The chicken noodle soup was really good, as were the mashed potatoes. I would have liked more chicken in the soup, though it was pretty tasty and the large noodles made me happy.

Halfway through eating we saw a woman start choking. Her companion, an older gentleman, clearly hadn&#39;t ever done the Heimlich as he started to put the poor woman into a full nelson. Someone from the restaurant was around and quickly took over.

So, kudos to the staff for responding as quickly as they did. I wish more people knew the signs of choking and appreciated the urgency with which one should take action.

Jameson&#39;s is an affordable and reliable place to go for a steak, chicken and fish, too. All entrees come with soup AND salad...and the bread you get to devour before dinner is to die for. For someone like me who gets a little crazy when he&#39;s hungry, this is vital!

The interior is warm, low light, lots of wood, and like Kevin said, the rat pack style booths are comfy and cool. It&#39;s just a classic place that I will always return to. It&#39;s in a very unassuming location and you would never think anything of it when you drive by.

Dinner includes soup and salad, and side.  Sandwich orders  include soup.  You can bring a big group of people  and there is something on the menu for everyone (maybe not vegetarians).

I had driven by many times without trying because I assumed that it was an overpriced steakhouse that I wouldn&#39;t be able to justify for my daily lunches.  On a friend&#39;s recommendation, I one day found out that I was wrong.

Jameson&#39;s is located on the corner of Busse, Algonquin and a small street called Dempster.  It is tucked in next to a strip mall.  I mention this because, it is a little annoying to get into the parking lot.  Coming from the south I find that the best way is to turn left on Algonquin and then right into the strip mall and come around from behind Jameson&#39;s.  Once you get there, they have ample parking in a lot separate from the strip mall.

Walking in, the atmosphere is classy and dark with a lot of wood.  There is a host station as you walk in and we are always seated promptly.  Every time I have been to Jameson&#39;s for lunch, I have been seated in the bar.  &#34;Watch your step&#34;, they have to say as the booths are up a step on a riser above the main floor.

So what about the food?  They start you off with a warm loaf of bread and some whipped butter.  It is tasty, but the crust on the bread is tough and to cut it they give you a steak knife that is so dull you could give it to a toddler without worry.
There are certainly steaks and fish and other higher priced items on the menu, but for lunch I stick with the sandwich type stuff.  The hamburgers are large and cooked well.  I have been enjoying the Cajun chicken breast sandwich lately though.  It is served on a big pretzel bun, nicely spicy, and the chicken is moist and delicious.  It also comes with steak fries and a little plastic cup of cole slaw.  But before the sandwich arrives, the meal also comes with soup.  I have had several of the soups and they are very good.  I have enjoyed the mushroom soup as well as the Manhattan clam chowder.  I am always stuffed when I am done eating at Jameson&#39;s.  In fact I have to make a conscious effort to leave some food behind... it is just too much.  The prices for all this food run around $9 (plus tax and tip of course).

The service is generally good.  The waitresses are no-nonsense, but they get the job done.  The busboy does a good job of keeping water glasses filled and plates cleared.

Overall, I like Jameson&#39;s for lunch.  The service and atmosphere are a step above many of my favorite lunch places, but I don&#39;t think my heart could handle eating this way every day.  I will be back."

(the noodle&#39;s were tortellini with little bits of carrot and pea&#39;s -damn was it good)  The steak was just meh, but the rock lobster - yummy)  I had carrot cake for dessert that was good.

But for me one of the main qualities in a restuarant is their bar.  Seriously, they NEED to get a new bartender.  In the last month I have had 4 raspberry martini&#39;s there.  All  TERRIBLE.  I finally got sick of sending them back.  (but a side note:  if you want really good raspberry tasting nyquil, this is the place)"

To start, I really like cocktails, and I&#39;m not sure who the bartender is, but they are always doing great work. One of the best Manhattans I&#39;ve ever had was from here. They also make a mean Negroni. Ok, sometimes I just come here for the drinks, but that&#39;s fine with me!

As far as pizza, pizzettes, or appetizers go, you can&#39;t pick something bad. The lobster mac and cheese is a solid choice, but the mushroom polenta is outstanding! I could lick the plate to be quite honest. Don&#39;t shake your head at the tuna pizza either, it&#39;s probably one of the best flavor combinations I&#39;ve had. 

Also, not a big dessert person, but my family goes crazy for the salted caramel gelato. And the beignets. Come here. You will be glad you did!"

We sat outside, which was a horrible mistake. The Metra train is right across the way from here, and during dinner time trains come by every few minutes, the horns screaming and interrupting conversation. I would just give up on outdoor seating. 

The waitress was nice and helpful, and the food smelled amazing. I ended up ordering the lobster mac and cheese...and it looked good...but it was so bland. It didn&#39;t taste like lobster. It didn&#39;t taste like cheese. There was no seasoning. Just blah. The prices are high for how bad the food is. And you don&#39;t get bread or anything complimentary with the meal. I just wasn&#39;t impressed at all."

Food: we ordered the cheese plate. For what we got (cheddar, a goat cheese and something we weren&#39;t quite sure of) it was really over priced. We both ordered pasta dishes, which were reasonably priced, flavor was fine, but were a bit on the soupy side.

Service: extremely slow and inattentive. We waited a long time for our server to come to the table. We were not given water until after we got our cheese plate. My husband ordered a 2nd beer and waited for it for 10 minutes. 

We really liked the menu and atmosphere, gluten-free options, as well as location, so we&#39;re really disappointed to say we will not be coming back."

They greet u with bland attitudes and are not friendly. 

When u walk into a classy wine bar with fab food you would expect to be greeted a bit better when u walk into the door. I expected bubbly friendly happy to see u personalities. If your gonna spend the money on putting together this great place .... spend the money on a great hostess/hostesses

Every single thing we ate off the menu was delicious. There are also a lot of good gluten free options (appetizers, main dishes and desserts) for anyone needing it.

We started with the roasted mushrooms on polenta, which was our least favorite of everything we ate that night, but still really good! Then I had the sauteed apple chicken which was delicious- it tasted way better than I even expected. My husband had filet medallions which he said was super good (he&#39;s frequently disappointed in many places when he orders steak but he loved this and was surprised they cooked it exactly as ordered- another thing many places get wrong). Then we had the banana fritters for dessert and I can&#39;t even put into words how good this was. If you go there, you HAVE to try it!! It was our favorite part of the meal.

Service was good and not at all slow like some other reviewers have commented. We went on a Saturday night and the place was probably 95% full with no wait. We will definitely be going back."

Their wine menu was intriguing and I couldn&#39;t decide which to choose.  Fortunately, they gave me a small taste of two I was deciding on.  The vouvray was great! I also loved the Sauvignon blanc.

I ordered The fish of the day which was grilled mahi mahi over grilled asparagus, diced butternut squash,!and a sauce. It was very good. The fish wasn&#39;t dry and the portion size was perfect.  My boyfriend had the steak frites which was also delicious.

Service time was about average for a restaurant on a Saturday.  Our waitress was pleasant and helpful. The price was reasonable considering what we ordered and two drinks each.  This is definitely a spot we want to visit again and to try more menu items."

We have been here twice in two weeks and still look forward to coming back in the future and trying more items. This is a nice sized restaurant space with a more casual feel. Both times I came were on Wednesday  evenings. About 75% of the tables were filled up during both visits. The first time our service was on the slow side, and the second time it was better because we came a little earlier in the evening and it didn&#39;t get crowded until we were almost done eating. I think it is possible that the restaurant is a little understaffed, which accounts for the slow service. Hopefully they are better staffed on the weekend. 

Their wine list was pretty big, and there is also a decent selection of cocktails and beers as well. I enjoyed both the whiskey cocktail I had during my first visit and my glass of wine during my second. 

The food was excellent!  The fried olives had a good flavor and were non greasy. The braised pork shoulder with polenta was savory, but the lobster mac n cheese is my favorite so far. They put large chunks of real lobster in this dish and the cheese sauce was delicious. You must try the lobster mac and cheese ! 

The creme brulee came with fresh berries and was big enough to share. This dessert was a nice way to end the meal"

Food ranges from $11-$25. So not the cheapest, but not ridiculous either. 

I have had the campanile vodka pasta with chicken and it was fantastic! I also really enjoyed the apple chicken. My friends have enjoyed the meatballs, lobster mac, and the short rib. For dessert the banana fritters and the creme brûlée is delicious! Most things you order on the menu will be yummy! 

The things that I do not recommend is the chocolate cake (too rich) and the tuscan white bean dip (similar to humus but really bland). 

My only other small complaint is consistency. I feel like the dishes are slightly different each time I get them but it could be because of whoever is cooking that day."

For Mother&#39;s Day, we ventured out to 1913 which is a new Italian restaurant in downtown Roselle. We were excited when we walked in to see the interior well decorated with exposed brick and dark wood accents. The menu was reasonably priced with a good variety of entrees, pizzas, and pastas.  Our food was decent and everyone left satisfied. 

At the end of the meal, we noticed a tall gentleman with a goatee who I presume to be the manager greeting each table. Oddly enough, he went to each table but ours - he literally greeted the tables right next to us. For a restaurant that just opened recently, this is unacceptable. By being the only minorities at the restaurant and the first diners for the evening, you send a negative message with that kind of service. 

To the manager of 1913, you just sent Roselle back a hundred years."

BUT with that said...1913 Restaurant &amp; Wine in Roselle has a different feel. The décor is simple but elegant, you feel comfortable in a suit, or  jeans, it could be a cozy date night, or a family affair...From  pizza or a four course meal.

 We decided to try two different pastas one with duck and one with sausage each in their own right were delicious... very favorable, the bottle of wine was so full of body and color I wish I can remember the name. 

Our waiter Marc was extremely knowledgeable and he has been with the restaurant since the beginning .....you can tell he was very passionate about his job.

I look forward to returning to try their pizza....the sausage in the pasta was so flavorful , l can&#39;t imagine how it will taste on pizza."

Relaxed patio dining, impeccable service, and very fair prices.  Had a $38 btl of Cab that would have cost $13-15 a glass in the city.  Meatball sliders were lovely with a nice hint of spice. Shrimp, leek, and four cheese flatbread was surprisingly light, crisp, and well-balanced. Mushroom small-plate was amazing.  Want to return for the pork-chop entree and the &#39;shells and shells&#39; pasta.

I would give 1913 five stars; however, we closed out our check, then ordered another round of drinks, and the waiter came back to our table and said that we had to leave because they were turning the table over for another reservation.

Everything I have tried has been good, but nothing stands out to me as much as that one pizza did. I like the large selection of wine here, especially since I like sweeter white wines.

The prices are on the high side and, as has been mentioned before, portions small.  (YES, I get the idea of small plates.)

I started with the Escargot.  The snails were prepared well and tasty.  Unlike most escargot preparations I have had where the snails are nestled in delicate puff pastry, here you get four pieces of toasted French bread.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was good but not great.

As my main course, I ordered the Margherita pizza.  It was not like any Margherita pizza I have had.  No tomato based sauce, just a bit of EVO.  The cheese was good and it was topped with orange and yellow plum tomatoes.  It lacked any seasoning that I could taste and other than the sweetness of the fresh tomatoes I didn&#39;t find it particularly flavorful.

I notice that they have thrown their neighbors, Lynfred Winery, a bone by including three Lynfred wines on their wine list.  I just don&#39;t get their devotion to French and Italian wines."

I&#39;d love to have a plate or basket while waiting, because yes the service is just a bit slow, just a bit, and not to the point I was annoyed. 

Best filet I&#39;ve had in a long while. Pot roast my wife reported as ok. Kids menu is nice and makes it family friendly.  

Price is on the high side, but so far not obnoxiously so.  I do agree with another yelper that the shrimp, although delicious, is a little light for the price. 

Pizza concoctions are not bad and reasonable.

Service was good.  Crab cakes where just ok, tasted a little like tuna.
Came with a side of fries. Which were the shoe string kind.  The waitress up-selled the side of asparagus, because the meal had no vegetable that came with it. Came about 4 min after we got our food, they were which were just ok, kinda sad looking.   not the big think ones,the really thin kind.

I waited months for this place to open. Once it did, it was a few weeks before I finally had a chance to try it during a book club meeting. We were tucked away at a table in the back of the restaurant. It was very dim, crowded, and loud. I was a little bit miserable. I don&#39;t handle dark and loud places very well. Right away, I knew this was not my kind of place.

On the plus side, our waiter was good, the owner came over to say hello, the wait for the food wasn&#39;t long, and the food was absolutely marvelous! The menu is filled with various small plates, so I wasn&#39;t sure how filling my dishes would be -- but they were perfect. I ordered the brussels sprouts and mac &amp; cheese dishes. Both were absolutely divine. My taste buds were dancing. The dishes were large enough for leftovers, which I was excited to finish the next day. Oh, and the silverware? Freakishly huge! I don&#39;t nornally notice the size of the silverware, but they could barely fit in my mouth. It was so weird. My main complaint is how pricey everything was. I realize that the dishes are meant to be shared, but if you order three or four dishes for two people, it adds up quick. Meh, like I said, not really my style.

Overall, not a bad experience, but nothing amazing. I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back with my husband to get a better sense of what it feels like to have a meal here and try some wine, but we&#39;re three weeks away from moving out of state and I won&#39;t be around.

A few weeks ago, we had plans with friends for dinner and didn&#39;t know where we were headed. Being the Yelper, its usually up to me to find something but this time, my girlfriend TOLD ME about this new place in Roselle!! 

WTH? Where have I been? We have a new place in Roselle? Where is it? What is it? What is it called?

1913!! I immediately jumped on the closest technical device I could find and got on their website to make sure it was appropriate for children and found a kids menu right away, so I knew we were headed in the right direction. 

We got all done up for a night out and as we left the house, the 150th storm of this year&#39;s winter decided to hit the Chicagoland area. As we skid our way to Main Street Roselle, we decided that our hunger was more important than our safety so off we went for din-din! Thank you to my hubby for dropping me at the door whilst he hunted for a parking spot!

The signage on the building is minimal. Almost a little difficult to find as it&#39;s unlit and quite small, but don&#39;t let that deter you! You will not be disappointed when you enter.

The raw brick and original floors that make up this building give it such charm and elegance in a subtle but obvious way.

I grew up riding my bike on the sidewalk in front of this restaurant with my friends after we shopped for candy and fun treats at the then pharmacy known as Howard&#39;s at the other end of this strip. Roselle is where I grew up and I love to support the local businesses that make up this town (check out how many times I have been to Lynfred winery)! 

We perused the menu, debated on cocktails, and landed on on ordering a pizzette with prosciutto and giardinara.  When we told the server that we were thinking about this particular pizzette, she lit up and said oh yeah, that was one of her favorites, so we ordered that to share between 4 adults and I have to say, even with our large appetites, it was quite perfect for 4 of us to share. 

The bottled water on the table is a nice touch. It alleviates cheapening the establishment with those plastic water pitchers you see everywhere else on earth. 

The boys both ordered pasta dishes and ate them up!! I selected their half chicken served with stuffing and my girlfriend ordered the scallops. When everything arrived, I immediately noticed my chicken was quite overcooked  (and my stuffing to be cooked on top/burnt on the bottom) but I really enjoyed the pizzette so much that I dug in to make sure it was not just the appearance to find that sadly, it was, in fact, incredibly dry.

As I was cutting into my dry chicken, my girlfriend began to rave about her scallops!! She said they were awesome! Unfortunately, as she started to eat the risotto that accompanied the scallops, she found it to be incredibly undercooked and full of PEPPER. So much pepper it was unbearably for even me who blackens her eggs with pepper every morning. After tracking down our server, she offered to take the entire dish back but she wanted to keep and eat the scallops. I found this to be SO WEIRD! After requesting a different pasta, they took her whole plate back and received her original scallops back with unseasoned, unsalted, undressed, plain pasta in place of the risotto. It was weird and thoughtless.

After witnessing the mess it was to get a replacement side, I chose not to say a word about my meal. I snagged a few bites of our friends&#39; little girl&#39;s pasta and a few of my hubby&#39;s, I ate enough of the dry chicken to satisfy my hunger. 

I decided to mention the burnt stuffing and overcooked chicken to the server at the end of the meal to which she did take it to show the manager. They ended up comping our two meals but nonetheless, there are some major kinks to work out here at 1913. I would tell them to stick to pasta and flatbreads but I know they are trying to do more and I completely respect that. 

I didn&#39;t know about 1913 until a few hours before we came so I truly did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised with the facility, the pastas and the flatbreads and look forward to returning once they have worked out the kinks."

We got to our table just before our reserved time and the server, Tyler, was quick to get our drink order. Their wine list is pretty extensive and their beer list has all the craft favorites as well as a full bar. We skipped appetizers and got straight in to ordering dinner, the crab ravioli that was on special was amazing! I feel like i have to mention that the kitchen was especially accommodating for my fiancé&#39;s meal (he has Chrones disease so red sauce is absolutely out of the question) because they allowed him to make his own dish by taking different parts of different entrees and making his own. I feel like most places wouldn&#39;t have been so quick to agree to that. 

We will definitely be back!"

It needs both more and less: a little more flavor and food on the plate and a little less of those menu prices.  

We ordered the escargot to start followed by the shells on shells and the pan roasted scallops for our main course.  The escargot was good though not great.  The broth was well-balanced but the escargot was chewier than desired.  The shells on shells pasta dish had clams, mussels, shrimp, artichokes, bacon, parsley, and a white wine butter sauce.  I loved all of those things; I just wish I had a little more.  It also just missed the mark on seasoning.  The pan roasted scallops were paired nicely with the white bean ragout, though it was seasoned with more ground pepper than my girlfriend liked.  All in all, the food is pricey for both the portion size and the quality of the meal. 

As for dessert, I&#39;ve tried to get crème brûlée twice here, and each time, the restaurant did not have it.  (Maybe the third time&#39;s a charm.)  If you, like me, can&#39;t get your mitts on that crème brûlée, order the pistachio gelato - it&#39;s delicious!

Aside from the food, the service was great - our server was very nice and attentive.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is surprisingly noisy so it did make chatting a little difficult.  I am glad we checked 1913 out, but it&#39;s not a place I&#39;m itching to revisit any time soon."

We were there for over 2 hours. My mom ordered the Campanelle, and it wasn&#39;t even made right. It said it came with vodka sauce, but it came out with a regular red tomato sauce. Then the waiter told us it was because he was &#34;confused with all the changes&#34; when all she did was take off the chicken and add shrimp. All around- not good at all."

 The Crab Cakes with the red wine butter which was amazing. Also ordered the Arugula Salad with fresh mozzarella, awesome. Finally got the quattro formaggi (Four Cheese pizza) Stole the show.

Wine list was huge, and I did not feel intimidated with the help the staff for recommendations and dinner pairing.

Don&#39;t come in here dressed like the negative stereotype of a travelling American, I don&#39;t want to look at that when spending painful amounts of money for yuppie food.

The whole point of the restaurant is small plates. The plates are small and the food is small that sits on the plates, OK?

It&#39;s fancy, expensive (overpriced?), and I&#39;m going to say worth almost every penny (would be happier if it was 25% cheaper). Service was great, we had Stephanie. Place is clean (including restrooms), lean, and a money making machine. Wish I worked there!"

Beyond disappointed this time too. Really wanted to frequent a neighborhood wine bar with great ambience, good food and a decent wine selection. They hit the mark on the wine menu but food and service missed the target.  We sat in the bar, which by the way has great ambience. The bartender/server was nowhere to be found. 10 minutes later, we were approached for a drink order.  Seriously, we felt that disappointment was imminent. It was.
Let me make it clear, it&#39;s not a cheap tab. But when you spend over $100 for three people for drinks and appetizers only to be disappointed, that translates into a bust. The server Karla does try but fails miserably in providing adequate service.  She&#39;s much too busy conversing with the regulars. As we left, I said to my family  that it&#39;s our last time there. I imagine the manager/owner that walks around really doesn&#39;t care that he lost a repeat customer but Schaumburg has too many choices to spend $$ at this disappointment.  Avoid it!"

My wife and I have frequented this restaurant since it opened several years ago. Some observations:

-the prices are not over the top expensive. Seriously? Have the &#34;naysayers&#34; dined in some of the downtown Chicago restaurants? Perhaps McDonald&#39;s or Subway might be a better choice for future dinning excursions

-the mussels are &#34;top notch. We have dined in multiple establishments in San Francisco, Napa, and Sonoma Valleys since 2001. The BEST mussels that we have experienced were by far at 1913

-the food is top notch (e.g. pasta dishes, salads, pizzas, and nightly specials) and reasonably priced. There is value when dining here

-the wine selection is unique due to a European influence (France, Italy; no California). European wines pair well with food. I love California wines, but European wines are spectacular when looking for pairing selections with entrees

-the service is always top notch. The owner/manager is always gracious and appreciative of our patronage. Does he always stop by our table? No, and it&#39;s ok.....

Bottom line: Roselle FINALLY has a wonderful, exciting restaurant to frequent."

Sometimes you just want to sit in the bar and watch the Blackhawks. And at 1913 you can do so, but just don&#39;t expect to have any food with that beer.  I guess you can order food  Monday through Thursday BUT not on Friday and Saturdays. SO if you are dining alone on a Friday or Saturday, you must sit alone in the dining portion of the restaurant INSTEAD of blending with the chaos of the bar nightlife. 

I enjoy the menu. The value of quantity to price though is something to be desired. The entrees overall are pricy, especially considering they are &#34;tapas&#34; and you are supposed to order several to fill a hungry tummy.

Another annoyance it the wine menu. 1913 is trying to create an authentic Italian/French dining experience; therefore, those are the only types of wine listed on the menu. It&#39;s a neat concept EXCEPT I have no idea what all these wines are like. I am used to seeing familiar titles like &#34;Cabernet&#34; &#34;Merlot&#34; &#34;Chardonnay&#34;... do not expect to see these names in their wine menu. Every time we go here I have to just trust the waitress/waiter that the wine they are suggesting is similar to the Malbec I really want...

We have been to 1913 several times. We have discussed these concerns to the staff. The bartenders are phenomenal and listened to our concerns but no change has occurred. There is a male bartender and a female one whom are by far the most friendly people in the entire establishment. 

Speaking of being friendly, we have never been greeted or welcomed by an owner since the opening week. (Every time we have gone here since, there is an owner present. We know so because they introduced themselves the opening week. I guess they are exhausted at being friendly.)

Our last dining experience: 

My husband and I rolled into 1913 at 4:30pm on a Friday. We are 2 of 5 patrons in the bar, no one in the dining area. Sure they&#39;ve only been open for 30 minutes.... but this is why you SHOULD HAVE A HAPPY HOUR. I was assisted in finding a glass of wine. My husband ordered a beer. What would go well with this? A flat-bread pizza! &#34;Sorry ma&#39;am you can&#39;t order this on the bar side, the kitchen may become overwhelmed.&#34; HOLY COW. We are the only people here?!?! &#34;We are kind of hungry and really want to sit the bar area, if you&#39;re being serious, we will probably leave.&#34; The bartender was professional and apologetic but was unable to allow us to spend more money. SO we paid our check and headed to another restaurant in downtown Roselle where we can drink and eat in the same room. Did I mention there must have been 6 waiters and waitresses just hanging around the bar waiting for business to come in?

Overall, I want this restaurant to thrive. I was very excited when it opened. I hope they begin to listen to patron requests and offer what customers want."

My first trip there, with the group, I had a glass of teraldego that I wasn&#39;t too impressed with.  The food, however, was pretty good.  I got the lobster mac-n-cheese, and it was good and satisfying, but not very flavorful.  My husband had the carne pizza and he loved it.  The rest of the group liked their food quite a bit as well.
For dessert, we all had different dishes and shared them amongst our group.  One friend had the gelato and didn&#39;t particularly care for it, but everyone else loved their desserts.  I had the creme brulee and it was so good that I ordered a second one to split with the group.  

The second time I came here, I had the roasted mushroom small plate and a glass, per the waiter&#39;s recommendation, of the Barbera d&#39;Asti.  The wine was FANTASTIC, especially for the price.  The roasted mushroom dish was good, but spiced a bit too much.  The service was very prompt and, of course, the waiter really knocked it out of the park on the wine recommendation.

I will agree that the place is in desperate need of some acoustical paneling or batting, as it does get too loud when there&#39;s an appreciable number of people in it.
But all in all, the food is good (some minor tweaks to the recipes would make it great), the desserts are for the most part really delicious, and the wine selection is generous.  Also, there are some really good wines on the list, and the prices aren&#39;t horrible."

We each got an entree, 2 glasses of wine, and then a dessert to split. In total our bill was only about $60 with tip. We were very surprised and happy with that! I would&#39;ve thought it was going to be more. So worth it and will definitely be back!

The desert also came out fresh and on point, we got the rice pudding and creme brûlée. Pizza is great, when in doubt here - get pizza! Escargot was just ok, but only because I&#39;ve had better.

My daughter had the angel hair with radicchio. It was virtually flavorless. I had the 4-cheese pizza. It was alright; nothing special.

From the local art on the walls, to the amazing (and affordable) wine list, this restaurant made many great first impressions.
The service was fast, knowledgable, and super friendly. Our server had great recommendations for us regarding wine and food. 
The food was amazing, and the portions were perfect. We had several courses, and left feeling full but not over stuffed.
The owners also made a point of checking in often, and we felt more than well taken care of all evening.
If you are looking for fresh, authentic, local fair; this is the place to frequent."

Those of us who live in the area are well aware of the &#34;good restaurant&#34; drought we&#39;ve had. 

So let&#39;s get to the good stuff...

+ Gorgeous redesign. The space is used far more effectively and decorated in a modern, yet rustic way. Props for the art on the wall being designed by a local high school artist.
+ The owners care. Like, truly, deeply care. They themselves are from Roselle and passionate about their restaurant having great food and a lively atmosphere.
+ The menu has a variety of items - pizzettes, small plates, pastas, flatbreads. You name it, they&#39;ve got it. 
+ Pasta. Pasta. Pasta. I love a light pasta dish that packs bold flavors.
+ Roasted mushrooms were a total plus. 
+ Meatball sliders
+ Great service. 

Mehs:
- Prices on most dishes were kind of high. Especially on the pasta dishes. For $15+ I expect more than a cup&#39;s worth of pasta. 
- The French Onion Soup. If you like good ol&#39; fashioned French Onion, this isn&#39;t the soup for you. It definitely wasn&#39;t bad, there were just nontraditional flavors.
- Mortadella and toasted pistachio pizzette. Just meh. I felt like it was a piece of crusted with a lot of cheese and a sprinkle of fried mortadella and crushed pistachios. 

1913 is off to a great start, and I definitely see a promising future for them in downtown Roselle. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the restaurant grow, trying more food, and finally having a cute, delicious, customer focused hot spot to hit up that&#39;s only a few minutes from home."

First off, I will say this restaurant is definitely meant for couples, or very small groups of people.  There small plate are where it&#39;s at! Each one we tried was great! We got the lobster mac and cheese (phenomenal), braised pork shoulder, medallions, and meatball sliders all of which were great! But, we had 5 people with us so it was very limited with how much we could eat.  The small plates are pricy, so if you want to get your money&#39;s worth, I recommend only going with one other person.  Because there were 5 of us, we got a main dish as well which was ok, but not stellar like their small plates were.  I do not recommend the campenelle (chicken with vodka cream sauce). Plain and dry. I got the Champagne Risotto with pan seared scallops which was fairly good but not great.  Stick to the small plates.

But, don&#39;t get me started with the salted caramel gelato.  A must try if you go here! It was amazing.  I was in heaven while eating it!

Now, they&#39;ve definitely got some service bugs to work out. This is why I would like to give them a 3 but their amazingly sweet and nice hostess makes up for that. She was awesome and made sure we were taken care of while we were waiting for our table.  Which leads me to my next complaint.  We waited for 40 min in the bar area for our table to ready.  Not a big deal with a brand new restaurant opening in pretty much a restaurant desert.  BUT, the bar area is half the size of the restaurant AND has plenty of large tables and the do not serve food at the bar.  Are you kidding me? I saw so many people walk out and go somewhere else when they were told they couldn&#39;t eat at the bar.  Figure that out and you&#39;ll get more business! 

And no Lynfred wine...really? I know they&#39;re sticking with the italian and french theme but you have an AMAZING winery right down the street and you&#39;re not going to utilize it. WHY?

I hope they work their service out because this place has GREAT potential in this area.  The atmosphere is amazing (original hard wood floors, exposed brick)... beautiful, the food was delicious (the small plates at least)! But their service could really turn people away."

Having read the mixed bag of reviews I was hopeful that some people just hit an off day. Instead I found they were spot on. 

No food service in the bar seemed just odd and the TV&#39;s were distracting. 

Our server was ok but the food was bland. Generally with small plates you order a few, then order more if needed. Our server seemed to think this was a strange concept.  

The prices were way too high for Roselle. I&#39;ve eaten small plates in Chicago and our total bill with cocktails was less than we paid here. If we&#39;re going to spend that kind of money, I want an exceptional rather than mediocre, experience. Sad to say we won&#39;t be back."

I love the wine list and we could order a decent bottle for a decent price. The first time we went, we had the scallops, lobster mac and cheese and escargot. The scallops and escargot were amazing. I didn&#39;t care for the lobster mac and cheese. I thought it was a little dry. 

The second time I went I had the crab cakes with fries, which were amazing and the angel hair pasta which was also very good.

I had the gelato both times I went. I have been to Italy and tasted the gelato over there. Let me tell you 1913 was very close to the gelato in Italy.

I love this restaurant and can&#39;t wait to go back!"

My food was so bland i couldn&#39;t even eat it. Im super disappointed and I hoped for so much more. The best part was the fries. Can you believe that?! Plus our server was so concerned about her larger table of 10-12 people that she forgot about even taking our money. All the other servers have addressed their tables around us 3x&#39;s more than our server has come to us. I give 2 stars just for the wine. I&#39;d just go next door to 8000 miles instead of here. Honestly thats exactly what we are going to do. And we just spent $140. Bummer.

The wine was okay, service was decent, the food was pretty good. There wasn&#39;t much else to judge on. I know there are a lot of places out there that want their food to speak for the restaurant, but if your food isn&#39;t mouth-wateringly incredible, have something to tack on to your name that will make you memorable. I would probably come back here, as it is one of the better places to eat when I visit family in Roselle.

I took my dad for his birthday. He&#39;s a foodie, wine specialist, and cocktail connoisseur so it&#39;s always nerve-wracking to dine with him. Aside from a &#34;mediocre&#34; old-fashioned and pork belly that wasn&#39;t cooked correctly, everything else was great. The house-made ricotta with honey was unreal. The creamed corn is the best I&#39;ve had. The star of the meal was the pork shoulder over polenta. I wanted to lick my bowl. He had the same and said it was &#34;wonderful.&#34; The pork is cooked with dried cherries, which adds a juicy burst of tartness every few bites. We were stuck between two different bottles of Sancerre, and asked the waiter for a recommendation. He suggested the Chateau Sancerre; It was delish. We had zeppoles for dessert.  I didn&#39;t expect much but ate three of them. The texture is crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy on the inside. 

Great meal. I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

Ambience: Cool brick walls and lovely lighting; seems to be going for a rustic modern look. Sound seemed to bounce off the walls a bit, though, which made it hard to have a conversation at times. After dinner the bar was way too loud, with the sports channel blasting commercials (they must have forgotten to change the channel when the Hawks game was over.)

Service: our waitress was just so-so. She was attentive and came by often to refill our wine and take more orders, but she looked and sounded like she was bored, and she definitely wasn&#39;t engaging. 

Food: Some good, some average, and one really bad. The mussels were outstanding and came in a lovely wine sauce. The pizzette supposedly came with mixed seafood, but we counted all of five tiny pieces of clams. Then, thinking we were still hungry, we ordered the grilled polenta with mushroom sauce. The polenta was bland, and the mushroom resembled thick, pasty biscuits and gravy that has been sitting around a T&amp;A truck stop buffet for days. 

Overall, I like the concept of nice wines, beers and small plates, but they need to step up the friendliness of the service as well as get some new chefs."

Came here for my birthday dinner, honestly this place is good if you&#39;re just coming to have a few glasses of wine and some appetizers (small plates) in between glasses. But if you&#39;re coming here wanting a nice entree then you&#39;re in the wrong place. There were maybe 3 or 4 &#34;entree&#34; type choices on the menu. And even those did not come with any sides. We ordered these sautéed mushrooms and flatbread for appetizer and that must have been the best part of dinner. For dessert we got the creme brûlée and fruit tart with gelato, nothing extraordinary. 

Like I said before, go here only if you are planning to have a few bites to eat with your wine. 

Also, the owner should really look into putting up some sound absorber panels on the walls or ceiling because this place gets REALLY loud! Otherwise the interior ambience is really nice and the outside seating area is great on a nice day (besides the passing Metra train every 10-15 minutes).

I still have hope for this place since it is a fairly new business. A few changes and additions to the menu as well as doing something about the noise issue and this place can be a hit!"

It&#39;s Chicago-level cuisine without all the stuffiness. Great atmosphere, thoughtful wine and beer selection, and wonderful food!

The space has been beautifully restored and has a nice cozy ambiance. To start off, the wine and beer list are well curated and go well with the menu selections. I had the pinot noir, and my boyfriend was pleased to find a stout from New Holland Brewing (Dragon&#39;s Milk Bourbon Barrel Stout if you&#39;re curious). 

We started off with the mussels which were cooked perfectly and accompanied by the most delicious broth. Only complaint here is that I wish there had been more bread served with the dish to soak up all that goodness! 

On to the entrees. We both chose the pork shoulder which is served over polenta. The pork shoulder was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. The polenta was a great compliment in both taste and texture. I wanted to lick the plate! My boyfriend also got the trout which he was pleased with.

For dessert we split the banana espresso bread pudding. Perfect ending to a great meal! Not to sweet, and served with your choice of vanilla or chocolate gelato.

Service was fine. Nothing outstanding, but I suspect the place is still trying to fall into a groove between the kitchen, waitstaff etc. Overall, our server was friendly, attentive, and any minor details (people have mentioned their water wasn&#39;t poured...really?) were overlooked by the overall great experience of our meal. 

Looking forward to coming back often and taking advantage of this gem that&#39;s so close to home!"

With that said, I only gave them 3 stars because we had a lot of service issues. However, they have only been open for about 5 weeks. When we go again I will definitely update if our service experience is better. 

We had  a large party (was supposed to be 12 but dwindled to 8 before our night out). We called 3 weeks in advance to make reservations and they do not take them. This was very disappointing since we had such a large group. When we arrived the bar seating was mostly empty and they told us the wait would be 1 hour and 15 minutes. The gentleman who seemed to be the owner or manager said they would try to get us in quicker. We also thought he said we could eat in the bar if we decided to but when we asked our waitress she said no. We wanted to experience the dining room since it was our first time there but it would have been nice if we could have at least ordered an appetizer while drinking in the bar. Especially because it ended up being ONE HOUR AND 40 MINUTES for a table!!!!!! So much for the &#34;but we&#39;ll try to get you in quicker&#34;. It would have been good to have had the opportunity to order a little something while we were drinking for almost two hours in the bar! In all that time we sat at the bar people were streaming in the whole time and at one point the bar was completely full. By the time they called us for our table the bar was almost completely empty. It seemed as though they were taking all of the smaller parties that came in after us and it made our wait longer to get a larger table for 8. They definitely need to work out these seating kinks. Also, I would HIGHLY recommend they take reservations for parties of 6 or more. We won&#39;t come with a large group again due to this - the wait was just too long. 

The bar waitress was very sweet and friendly, but she knew nothing about the wine list at all. My friend wanted a glass of wine that was on the &#34;bottle&#34; list and we asked if she could get it by the glass. The waitress said &#34;yes&#34; but then proceeded to bring the bottle to our table. She also brought a glass of wine that no one ordered. When we got our bill she had charged us for the bottle of wine that we returned and several of the other drink orders were wrong on our bill. By then they had called us to our table (finally!) and they told us they would bring the bar bill to our table. They brought it with our dinner check and it was still wrong, but it was actually less than what we ordered so we just let it be. 

The menu was a little confusing because several of the &#34;small plates&#34; looked like they were enough to be actual entrees. The waitress assured us that they weren&#39;t. Had we been eating with a smaller group they probably could have been entrees but since we had such a large group it worked out well. We thoroughly enjoyed everything. The lobster mac and cheese was phenomenal. The Bolognese pasta was delicious as well as the pasta with mushrooms and pancetta. Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t try any desserts but will be sure to next time. 

The wine list was extensive and we really enjoyed what we had. But it would be great if there were descriptions. They were almost entirely Italian and French wines and most were names we were unfamiliar with so it was difficult to chose because we really didn&#39;t know what we were ordering. The waitress in the bar was not knowledgeable so this made it difficult to chose what to order. 

The ambiance is great - they did a beautiful job with the build-out. The food is very good and the wait staff in the dining room was good. They need to work on their seating system when it&#39;s busy and people are waiting and the bar staff needs more training. Lastly, I highly recommend they accept reservations for parties of 6 or more - this was a huge disappointment and until they accept reservations we will never come back with more than 4 people.  But we will definitely visit again."

The egg rolls isn&#39;t that odd tasting egg roll so many area restaurants serve - a serious plus.  The House Special Soup is flavorful and chock full of wonton, veggies, etc.  The garlic chicken was very tasty, a little sweet for my taste and not enough hot to offset.  However, I do eat a lot of spicy food, so I most likely just need more for my palate, as a result.

I always go for their GamJa Tang, and booooy do they deliver. Every time I go, each table has at least one person eating it: now that itself should tell you how good it is. I&#39;ve brought so many friends to eat here because I voucher that their GamJa Tang is the best in Chicago and haven&#39;t heard any rebuttals yet. Trust me, I&#39;ve tried so many in discontent that I always come back.

Instead of dining in, I picked up food after a great workout and knew this is the only thing to cure my meat cravings. The restaurant feels very homey, but doesn&#39;t give off that &#34;cozy vibe&#34; people use to describe a small or old looking restaurant; no this is like eating at someone&#39;s house. The banchan (side dishes) taste just like how mama Joe makes them and can tell it&#39;s truly homemade. It&#39;s guaranteed that I order more banchan when I dine in (banchan=FREE FOOD). The servers are very friendly and check up on you, which is not so normal for a Korean restaurant.

GamJa Tang is literally translated to potato soup, but is quite far from just a potato soup. I&#39;ve been told there is a part of a pig that is called gamja (&#34;potato&#34;) that&#39;s used in the soup. Beats me, all I know is the soup is a MOUNTAIN of meat. So much that the meat is always peaking out like an iceberg. I&#39;ve yet to see the bottom of the bowl because I can&#39;t stress enough how much meat you get. It&#39;s meattastic.

*Side note- the soup gets gelatinous if you put it in the fridge over night. Sure tell sign that they cook that sucker for hours!

The soup does take some work to eat because the meat is still on the bone, but man, that&#39;s honestly the best part. The meat glides off the bone and melts in your mouth. Oh god, meat cravings are coming back... It&#39;s a bit spicy, but you can ask them to tone it down for all you non-spicy eaters who still loves to eat half a pig. I recommend going at lunch, because the GamJa tang is 25% cheaper than the dinner price. I strongly believe they make food for the people instead of for profit at those prices.

Now you ask, how come you knocked off a quarter point on the ratings if it&#39;s that great? Well, only because I&#39;m in a coma every time I eat there. I cooould eat half the meal, but come on, how else does one satisfy their meat cravings: by demolishing it!!"

They give you plenty of food for the price, and the lunch menu is very extensive, so there is ample selection.  Everyone I ate with commented that they enjoyed their meals.

The waitress was friendly.  It was actually kind of unusual because most Korean places seem like they are in a rush to get customers in and out but this place let us take our time.

It&#39;s an unspoken truth and if you ventured to Korean restaurants as a non-Korean, then you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about. Fortunately, Bowl and BBQ is one of the few where I have received the best service and I&#39;m not Korean. 

This is a Korean BBQ restaurant that offers kalbi (Korean marinated beef short ribs) and other traditional Korean dishes. Although not all-you-can-eat, the quality of the meat is noticeably different. I brought my sister here for her birthday recently and we got two full orders of kalbi. After dining at kalbi buffets, I was amazed at how better the meat tasted here at Bowl and Barbeque. We enjoyed a plentiful amount of red leaf lettuce, miso soup, and pan chan (side dishes) that accompanied the meal. I couldn&#39;t help but devour the myulchi (small anchioves) and toenjang (spicy miso paste). 

For the area, this is my kalbi restaurant of choice. I would recommend this place if you are craving Korean BBQ and kalbi (even if you are not Korean)."

Went there twice in the last two weeks, and I can say the food is the best out of all Korean restaurants in Chicagoland. I moved back to the states from Korea 5 years ago, and have been very VERY disappointed with the quality of Korean food here. Although this place isn&#39;t &#34;OMG so good I&#39;m going to cry&#34;, but it sure beats all the other places around here! I have tried the Jokbal (pig hocks), Bossam, Dolsot Bibimbop, Seafood Pajun, and Gamjatang (pork and potato stew) and all of it has been outstanding to say the least. The dolsot bibimbop is hands down the best i&#39;ve had in the states, period. It seems like an easy dish, but many places disregard how the veggies would taste mixed up, and it comes out sub par. Bowl and BBQ&#39;s dolsot is exquisite. Their side dishes were also yummy as well. I think the owner has a case of the Resting Bitch Face, but she is in fact really nice.

ANYWAY, besides the whole kimchee fiasco, they have really good food here.  Most korean places do it right, but there are a few that do it wrong and totally miss the mark.  happily this place hits it right on the mark with prices and taste/quality of the food.

We left the rest of our meal here and didn&#39;t bring it home.  Walked away shocked at the rudeness of it all.  So, we&#39;re done, which is too bad.  A meal is so much more than food.  It is also the graciousness with which you are served.  

The two times in my dining life that I&#39;ve ever been hassled and roughed up (LOL) with to-go containers were both at restaurants that served kimchee.  What&#39;s up with that."

She just had a busy night. I ordered some appetizer, kalbi as usual, and finish it off with cold noodle. Aside from great taste, I was amazed how friendly their attentive service was.  Every thing was cooked for me and handed to me. I felt like I was a king for a moment. I&#39;ll be coming back for another barbecue next time."

Showed up 10 min late by accident, sorry. Got seated in the lovely outdoor patio with my trusty Barefoot of Cabernet and my newest flavor of the week. Julia took care of our magical evening. Even though it was very busy, the food came out reasonably fast, while sipping on our adult beverage.  We split the sampler platter that came with a fantastic four of choices. Steak jiberto was a giant. And we also got pastor tacos. Delicious!

Highly recommend if ur ever in the area looking for a little Latina fever!"

Cons: guac wasn&#39;t worth it.

Tried a lot all in one take. Highlight for me was the PR beans. I can&#39;t emphasize this enough. Cuban was ok. Nice to have as an option where there isn&#39;t that item anywhere else in the area. 

I would have given 3 star except for the excellent and friendly service.

I picked up my order on a Friday night. It took about 30 minutes.  The dining room was very busy and the wait for seating was over 45 minutes. The server recommended making reservations.

More authentic feeling than kitschy in regards to the tropical vibe...as some of these places can be... (like that Tiki place out in the near Western burbs I can&#39;t think of it right now)

The food is really really authentic and good... 

There are different variations apparently of the food it can be 
A) Cuban
B) Puerto Rican
C) Mexican
Styles and flavors... and it&#39;s very fresh.

Shout out to Ah-Mazing Amanda (like the Best Server ever, she has ESP... FYI) who answered questions and read my mind... didn&#39;t have to ask for things, just had to think them... SCARY.

We gave her a 45%+ tip. Yeah she was that good... don&#39;t want to P.O. a psychic... was her accent is pretty impressive for a non Latina too. ;-)

Such service from the kitchen too... I had their first ever attempts at shrimp tacos... good, but their tuna tacos are SO GOOD... and their chocolate flan... YUM.

Try this place for authentic and delish."

I had a smile plastered on my face like quite the fool, but the food was so fantastic that it elicited such a reaction.  El Bistro Latino is a great new addition to the immediate area and I can forsee it being extremely successful because of its modern authenticity.  I love when a dish stays true to its roots, but find a way to put a little zest into it - this restaurant has skillfully achieved this relationship, and it makes me fantasize about coming back again and again to try all the other  items on their menu!  I&#39;ll be straight with you - this is one of new favorite restaurants.  They really do it right, here!

Before I talk about the food I have to give a shout-out to our amazing server, Alissia  (I probably misspelled that).  She was great - she was vibrant, knowledgable about the menu items and attentive without being overbearing.  Our server offered samples of the four kinds of frescas available and she was more than willing to talk with us about the menu items.  I would hope that if we came back again she would be there; usually I&#39;m indifferent to the service so long as it is good, but this time I was very impressed and it would be a factor of why I&#39;d come back.

Onto the food, the very best part!  It&#39;s a combination of cuisines from Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Cuba which is probably why there is a little flare in the food, instead of the same ole, same ole.  The menu is a good size - not too big and not too small - and they serve up about 8 types of meat!  My fiancé and I ordered the jibarito dinner, and we got the sandwich with the carnitas filling - best decision ever!  The carnitas were so incredibly tender that they fell apart (and they werent fatty either) - that&#39;s how I like my carnitas!  The sandwich was out-of-this-world, not to mention huge!!!  You may want to save room for this, but don&#39;t!  

You have to eat, eat, eat so that you can try, try, try everything on the menu!  For appetizers we got the empanadas and the fried plantains with cinnamon sauce..although I loved and would recommend both, the latter is a must-try!  The cinnamon sauce that comes with these plantains tastes like it comes directly from Cinnabon!!!  To round out our food experience we got two orders of flan - the vanilla flan anf the coffee flan.  Both were great, but I&#39;m a lover of the coffee flan for sure!  Now, I gotta give some love to the frescas as well - they offer watermelon, hibiscus, cucumber lime and mango fresca.  All of them are great, but the watermelon was my favorite.  It literally tastes like the juice from a watermelon...it&#39;s freaking fantastic.  The only bummer is that they had run out of the horchata so I didn&#39;t get to try any sadly.  I plan on going back to get my hands on some though.

Yes, it was a little disappointing that they had run out of this, but I&#39;m giving them the benefit of the doubt because they are a new restaurant that&#39;s testing the waters.  Just beware that this may happen, but I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed for them, and you should too!  Despite being seemingly short-staffed and a tiny bit short of food, they served up great quality service and dishes.  I&#39;m a huge, huge fan!  

The cherry on top of this already delicious sundae is the super affordable cost of dining.  We got all of of that states above for $30 or so!  That&#39;s unheard of for as good of quality food that we got.  This is a true gem in Des Plaines!

By the way, it&#39;s a BYOB!  Parrrrttttyyyyyyy!"

We came out of our way to visit and try the buffet.  
There are many buffets out there, but we were excited to find one with a Latin culture! 
The decor is vibrant and filled with a heritage and energy that isn&#39;t overwhelming yet calming at the same time.
Music is piped in and most enjoyable. A multi mix of cuban,mex,and PR.  Not too loud yet voulmed enough to seep into your inner dancer and still be able to have a conversation. 
Now as for the cuisine.
Buffet had all three tastes and offerings ,Cuban,Mexican and Puerto Rican.
You might think ahh Mexcian..yeah yeah..but truly the flavors were an inner mix of delight.
The buffet wasn&#39;t extensive, however most definitely enough. 
I missed the green olives in the PR rice tho. However not everyone likes green olives.
So the owner said she would consider placing green olives on the salad bar!
All in all a tantalizing experience and we are looking forward to coming back for a dinner and try made to order entrées."

Unfortunately, we did not have the same experience. The food was okay: steaks were over cooked and they were out of some side items and beverages. The waitress didn&#39;t know 2 of the 3 items they were out of until someone else reminded her. 

The service was probably the worst part of the entire experience. For an empty place during the time we went, the food took much longer than expected. We were told it was fresh and made aware of the wait, but literally there were less than a handful of customers in the restaurant. We had to remind the waitress to fill our water during our meal since she didn&#39;t notice it on her own. We had to ask twice for extra napkins since she didn&#39;t bring some when we first asked. When we paid our bill, we noticed a few errors and had to get them corrected. 

Overall, I would not recommend this place solely based on service. $96 for 6 people could have been spent at much better places for a Saturday lunch."

We ordered a Jibarito (pork), and a Cuban.

We got the Puerto Rican rice and beans as a side and it was amazing though we missed the traditional olives.

Fresh chips and two kinds of fresh hot sauce are served as an appetizer.

The server gave us a little dish full of meat that I forget the name of. I can only describe it as a thick Latino red curry. Evidently you buy it by the lb.

The place was packed and they told us that if we come back the following evening, it would be wise to make reservations.

Very clean. Amazing team.

My daughter and I went here for lunch today. It was an enjoyable experience. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We had chicken Jabarito, because we enjoyed them last time. We also ordered guacamole, chips and salsa. Gotta say I&#39;m a fan of both their salsas and it&#39;s usually red or green for me depending on locations. We also ordered Yuca Frita and their wing appetizer. The wings were very tasty and the Yuca Frita was the best that I&#39;ve had. I&#39;ve had it at multiple restaurants, this is the first time that I&#39;ve noticed the yuca to be nice and soft inside but crunchy on the outside. Sometimes it can be a bit dry or stringy, but today it was perfect. The wings had a nice tasty  sauce. Overall enjoyed everything and will return. The decor is nice and neat with good spacing. The music was a little loud for my taste, but could have been the acoustics.

All our food was excellent - some of our favorites...

- Puerto Rican rice - flavorful, fresh, savory.  I am going to try to replicate this today, it was that good. Seriously, I might even call the restaurant and see if I can buy their PR rice by the pound.
- Yuca fries - addicting
- Jibarito - get the dinner with Puerto Rican rice and beans, and have the Jibarito made with lechon (pork). I&#39;ve never had anything like this before and it was so good.
- Tacos were great (my kids think they are taco connoisseurs), the asada was really good, not chewy like most. Good amount of onions and cilantro. We also tried lechon and pork rind tacos - everything we had was very good.
- BYOB - no corking fee.
- My kids had Mexican sodas, their favorite.

Our server was very attentive and fast - she was awesome.  Food does take a bit longer to come out than at your typical Mexican restaurant, but it was fresh and good. Prices were family-friendly."

At the time my bday was a week away and I decided this was the kind of place I wanted to bring my entire family to celebrate. 

My family is really diverse both in nationalities and palletes.  We range from Mexican,  Puerto Rican, Irish, Italian and Polish so finding a restaurant to satisfy everyone is always a challenge.  If you have ever found yourself in a similar situation LOOK NO FURTHER.

Let me start with how clean this place is, I&#39;ve been in a position at work for the last 15 years which requires me to look for imperfections; after all if the floors, windows and bathrooms are not clean, the kitchen is likely not going to be either.   This place was spotless, kudos to their team.

Okay, the food is great and I don&#39;t think people understand how incredibly difficult it is for a restaurant to have a chef (s) who can cook different ethnic meals and do El Bistro Latino does all versions very well.  The wait staff is fantastic,  they all help each other out.  Let me repeat that,  they all help each other out.  If there was an empty plate, someone would walk by and remove it. It seems simple right? Because they are walking back to the kitchen but next time you go out to eat somewhere notice how long your empty plate will sit there and how many times countless wait staff walks by including your server.  The type of attention to detail I&#39;ve only experienced at restaurants like Gibsons, Capital Grill, etc.  It takes a lot to get an entire wait staff to buy into working together as a team, but they have it figured out here. 

There is so much &#34;ethnic&#34; Mexican like carnitas or there wide variety of Mexican aguas frescas  (fresh waters). I know these very well, my mother literally makes aguas frescas weekly for us and this makes you feel like your dining at mom&#39;s or grandma&#39;s.  Their Puerto Rican rice and beans is phenomenal,  their shrimp &#34;al mojo de ajo&#34; (garlic shrimp) are crazy good.  

Oh and as if it couldn&#39;t get better, it&#39;s BYOB which only guarantees the bill will be way lower than your normal dinner out with drinks.  The music is loud enough to &#34;feel&#34; as my 1 year old daughter who loves to dance was dancing away in her high chair but not loud enough where you have to scream.

The owner stopped by to ensure everything was good and stated they have only been open approximately 3 months.   I can&#39;t imagine how busy El Bistro Latino will be in 1 year. My guess:  very busy, very clean,  very attentive and very good!"

Jibaritos were monster in size, crisp and fresh off the grill! Ordered the beef and chicken jibaritos as entrees which come with Puerto Rican style beans and arroz con gandules and the Cubano sandwich to add.

The Cubano had a very clean flavor, definitely not game-y like some pork sandwiches can be. All sandwiches were thoroughly hot and made to perfection. This is the most important quality to any dish being served at the restaurant.

Best part of this place is its closer to home and not a drive to the city! Even this is better than the city joints that have been around.

I am super excited about this new family-owned BYOB restaurant, not only because it&#39;s in my neighborhood, but because it&#39;s unique to Des Plaines and the neighboring cities. El Bistro Latino offers Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Colombian food! If you&#39;ve never tried some of these cuisines, you must visit here to experience the perfect bites! We tried the empanadas hecho a mano, yuca frita con ajo fresco (loved), tostones (loved), carnitas estilo Michoacan (loved), lechon, chicharrones en salsa verde (loved, loved, loved), costillas de puerco en salsa roja, chips and salsa (3 different types), the homemade cheesecake, and for beverages we had the aguas frescas de sandia (watermelon-loved ) and sampled the horchata(loved). Everything was delish!!! The service was very friendly, helpful, and attentive as were the owners. The owners were so welcoming; I felt like I was eating in their own kitchen. They let us sample some of the dishes which was so generous of them! The place itself is very clean, with interesting wall decor, and has an outdoor patio. There is also a lunch buffet. Overall, we had the greatest experience here. If you want unique delicious food served in a warm friendly environment with great Latin music in the background, you must give this place a try. Don&#39;t forget to BYOB!"

I did not see any, so I settled on the Cuban sandwich, very delicious and equal to other top Cuban restaurants in Chicago. I hope in the future they will have some traditonal Colombian food such as Ajiaco, Asado Bogotano and Bandeja Paisa. Arepas would be a great addition to the apetizers. Would rate higher if they had more Colombian dishes. One thing to note that put me off was the fact that while trying to enjoy a conversation and meal with my Mom, one staff member insisted on vacuuming!!!"

We can easily find good Latino food in the city, but it&#39;s damn near impossible to find anything remotely good in the burbs. That is until we discovered this place. 

The food selection is phenomenal, presentation is great and the actual food &amp; portions were a delight. Waitress brought out some sampler wings and fruit/vegetable drinks. The owner was even there walking around asking folks if they enjoyed the food. Given our Latino backgrounds, we began talking about the seasoning of the food and he asked us to try some food (i.e. Lechon) his father had cooked. It was AWESOME, despite the fact that we had eaten so much food. 

My buddy and I will certainly be back to try the rest of the food on the menu, as well as bring our wife&#39;s and kids to enjoy the phenomenal food and quaint environment. Did I mention it&#39;s a BYOB"

Their Yuca is unlike any other I&#39;ve had deliciously crispy outside with soft mushy insides you can&#39;t go wrong!!!! Their tacos are big too!

And you totally can since the music there is all tropical and all good! They have Mexican, Puerto rican, Cuban, and Colombian flavors here. I&#39;ve tried everything on the amazing buffet menu. Less than $10 with drink included and what an amazing variety. Lechon, carne con chile, chicken fajita, 3 different types of rice and beans.  You must try the cilantro rice w/a touch of lemon. It&#39;s to die for. You will leave there wishing you could fit more into your tummy! Yuca fries are delicious, fresh and crispy! Empanadas are ...well like sitting at home in the kitchen with your abuelita making empanadas and eating them. They ARE that fresh and absolutely full of flavor. We ordered Cubano sandwich today to go. I will update review after tasting that. I have no doubt, it will blow my mind as all of the other items here have. The owners are kind. Genuinely kind good people who greet their guests and truly value their opinions.  They have their daughter as a waitress and she is just as kind and darling as they are. I wish them all the luck and prosperity in growing their business although no luck is needed.

Since this was our first time, the server made some recommendations.  We started with the Empanadas.  I don&#39;t know what is the flavor they use in there, but they were so good.  We also had Tostones.  These were also outstanding but could have used a little more garlic sauce.  
We knew we couldn&#39;t eat a big dish each, so we had decided to share.  I had in my mind that I wanted Lechon, but the server talked us into a garlic shrimp dish. To compensate for the missed out Lechon, we opted for a Lechon taco instead.  While the shrimp was outstanding, and I would recommend that, the Lechon is the best pork I have ever tasted.  It melted in our mouth.  Next time I will skip the shrimp and just opt for the Lechon.  
We asked for Puerto Rican rice, and the chef was nice enough to also give us Cuban rice to serve with the beans, too.  The Cuban rice/bean mixture was outstanding, and that will probably be my &#34;go to&#34; going forward instead of the Puerto Rican rice.  
The restaurant is BYOB, and we called again to see if it was strictly beer/wine (it&#39;s not), so we pre-made margaritas and brought those.  They were kind enough to provide us with margarita glasses and ice.  We did tip extra for the added effort of providing us with what we needed for our drinks.  
Des Plaines is lacking in good restaurants, and generally go to downtown Arlington Heights for Latin food.  Now that we have found this place, this probably will be our &#34;go to&#34; restaurant, as it&#39;s nice and close to home.  And the food is positively outstanding."

So I came to Yelp and saw all the great 5-star reviews. So, of course, we decided it was worth trying and went for dinner on a Friday evening. Well, the wait for our entrees was 45 minutes (we timed it, something we always do). The manager (owner?) kept apologizing, saying they had just opened four weeks prior and were a bit short-staffed. In fact, she told us that about a week before the wait for the food was as long as 1-1/2 hours! Was that supposed to make us feel good about having to wait only 45 minutes? Well, it didn&#39;t! They did make an effort to make up for that wait by giving us samples of all the specialty drinks and making sure our tortilla chip basket and the accompanying salsas were kept replenished. But who wants to fill up on chips (even warm, perfectly salted ones) when you&#39;ve ordered steaks? Not us, that&#39;s for sure. So, our steaks finally came - and were way overcooked! They did offer to re-do them but by then we were very frustrated and didn&#39;t want to wait any longer. So we ate the overcooked steaks (one Puerto Rican and one Cuban style) and the sides that came with them. At that point we were pretty sure that all the five-star reviews on Yelp were given by friends and family of the owners because it sure wasn&#39;t anywhere near a five-star experience. In fact, we feel it was definitely no more than a one-star experience, if that. So why did I just give it five stars? Read on! 

My husband and I never judge a restaurant the first time there, especially when it&#39;s been open for such a short time. We always give a restaurant a second and then a third chance, and we&#39;re sure glad we did here, too. It was better the second time around (a week later) but we just ordered sandwiches, which came in 20 minutes; the sandwiches were fine and had I rated the restaurant at that time it would have been three stars. However, it was phenomenal the third time (a week after that). Our entrees came in exactly 13 minutes, my steak was perfectly cooked and my husband&#39;s Cubano sandwich was absolutely perfect. We asked about the guacamole and they brought us a good-sized sample - and it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had in years! The service was efficient and friendly despite the fact that it was very crowded, with at least two parties of eight or more people inside the restaurant and a  party of about 20 people seated on the patio. They very definitely earned the five-star rating I just gave them. We intend to return at least once a month and sincerely hope that they&#39;ll continue to earn those five stars but, if they don&#39;t, I&#39;ll let you know!"

Eat at the bar on a regular basis and get outstanding service every time.   We often split everything because the portions are massive and there is no attitude from the bartender.  

Usually packed with suits on weekdays and special celebrations on weekends and a decent bar crowd on a daily basis.

Make a meal out of the sides alone and you won&#39;t break the bank but dine with a friend and split the steak, you wont be disappointed,"

I think I&#39;m still trying to defend this place in my mind, that it deserves more than 3 stars. But $143 dollars later, I&#39;ve decided I can&#39;t give more than 3. For the price we paid, I wasn&#39;t blown away by the food and the service. 

We made a reservation for 7:30 on a Thursday night. Got there 10 mins early but werent seated until almost 7:45 which is fine and I would be more understanding if they were super busy but when we walked in, we saw a ton of empty tables. 

This place is ala carte so you are free to choose as much protein, entree, and sides as you like which can easily add up. I ordered the petit rib eye and my husband got the sea bass. They do warn you that the steak is served on a very hot plate and will continue cooking once served so that&#39;s something to keep in mind. The sea bass itself was nothing special but definitely tasted better with the citrus coconut sauce that it came with. The ribeye was flavorful and huge even though I got the petite one. Our server told us the sides are big enough for 2 people so we ordered the brussel sprouts to share. I was not impressed at all. I dont understand how it could be bad, it has bacon in it!!! But they were kinda soggy and the flavor was just weird. 

I would go out on a limb and say that the steak is comparable to what you would get at Longhorn but twice the cost. Our dining experience was good, but nothing to write home about. I would probably come back if I had a gift card or something."

What makes this place so great, is how accommodating they are. Went there for an anniversary, and the met every request I had for them. Service when you want it, and attentiveness when you need it. 

The steaks we had were cooked to perfection (as always on the 500 degree plates), sides large enough to feed a HUNGRY man, and the BEST sweet potato casserole. Unless you have tasted it, you can&#39;t begin to imagine the mouth-pleasure this dish provides. 

I&#39;ve never left a steak on my plate in my entire life. Now, between the enormous sides and the fantastic steak, this was a feast that made you move the notches on your belt. 

Make this a place to go. You won&#39;t be sorry and will definitely go back."

I know this is a chain restaurant as I have been to the one in St. Louis several years ago. I remember getting the cowboy ribeye and was so amazed by the powerful flavors of it piece by piece!

I kept telling my fiancé I would take him to try as he is a avid steak lover. We have done to David Burke&#39;s and Prime &amp; Provisions in the city recently and loved their steaks and flavors that we knew it was hard to top!

We ended up ordering the cowboy ribeye and splitting it and then getting the lobster mac &amp; cheese. I felt this ribeye did not satisfy or reach the potential of flavors I was looking for compared to the last time I had it and felt the lobster mac and cheese lacked the cheese flavor. 

We have another $25 gift certificate to use that expires this weekend, but have decided to not."

They have so many great steakhouses to consider, but I have been loyal to Gibsons for years. The group we were meeting wanted to try something new in the burbs. I&#39;ve have been to Ruth&#39;s Chris is a few cities, but it&#39;s been years. Unfortunately, they terribly disappointed me this trip. The &#34;16oz&#34; ribeye was so skinny and questionable at 16oz. The service was well below par for an empty restaurant 2 days before Christmas. I had an empty martini for over 15 minutes. I was ready to get into the holiday spirit and I was in no mood to wait. I don&#39;t care if I am downtown or in the burbs, my expectations is the service matches the price. 

The food:
Seabass-amazing, well cooked
&#34;16oz&#34; steak-cut poorly, so skinny. 
Cream Spanish-Good, nothing special
Lobster Mac and Cheese-best I have ever eaten. Unexpectedly light, not overwhelming with cheese. 

Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was below average for the price. That might not be a fair statement since I found a few outstanding dishes, but I was here for a great steak and they severely disappointed me. It&#39;s a steakhouse, screw up on the fish and you will have a good excuse. Screw up my steak and I will not be back."

I&#39;ve been to many  restaurants in many cities but this is my first visit to a Ruth&#39;s Chris... I&#39;ve been looking forward to this for quite some time. Beautifully decorated with white tablecloths thruout the dining room, this is my kind of place! From the service to the décor, this place screams fine dining... Rich in history, the first Ruth&#39;s Chris steakhouse opened on Broad Street in New Orleans in 1965...  All these years later, they have perfected the art of preparing fine meals...

I&#39;m a sucker for baked bread with whipped  butter and this one was baked to perfection. With its firm crust, light body and rich Flavour, this was the perfect way to start the meal...

For my first course, a white bean and chorizo soup prepared in a tomato base garnished with scallions... Delicious!

The aroma of steaks wafting  into the dining room overloaded my senses... Wow!

For my next course... The petite filet and lobster tail with a side of Cremini mushrooms; pan roasted with fresh thyme. First they start the primmest of beef, rub it with salt and pepper and then broil it in an oven at 1,800°... Even the plate is served at 500° to ensure that the meals is warm from beginning to end. Who does this?! Each forkful was like an explosion as the flavour saturated every square inch of my mouth... The lobster, seasoned and grilled was also over-the-top...

One of the things I like about this restaurant along with everything that I like about this restaurant is the fact that they tell you how long each course is going to take before it comes out of the kitchen... Setting the expectation just ensures that you&#39;re going to have a completely wonderful dining experience...

Dessert..., the crème brûlée... Classic Creole custard topped with fresh berries accompanied by my signature cappuccino...

What an amazing experience. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend you come here also! It bears repeating... Wow!"

It was extremely packed on a Saturday night with servers and bartenders running in every direction imaginable. We had a reservation for 7pm and I&#39;m assuming that was the worst possible time we could have made our reservation due to the line of people awaiting to get sat in the front room of the restaurant. The vallet wasn&#39;t too friendly, but hey it was raining so I might&#39;ve not been in the best mood myself. The hostesses at the front were busy as could be, trying to organize everything to get ready for their push of people. Jess, was very nice and wanted to make sure that she would get us seated immediately when a table opened up for us. When it came for our time to get sat, Jess walked us to our table and asked us how our night was going, if we were celebrating anything special, overall just a sweetheart. 

When seated, our server Dario approached us in a very friendly, warm-welcomed manner. He recommended a glass of wine for my wife (which she loved), and a nice cocktail for myself. After trying the fried calamari (which he also recommended), we decided to order entrees. We ended up doing the Ruth&#39;s Classics to be sure to try as much food as possible. Dario recommended we try the Augratin Potatoes along with the delicious Cremini Mushrooms. They were both delicious. When moving onto dessert we had once again asked for a recommendation and he pointed us towards the Creme Brulee, he brought us out quite the elegant array of desserts on a plate reading &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; candle-lit and all. 

Everything was fantastic.. from the warm-welcomes beginning at the hostess stand, to our outstanding service I would highly recommend going to this location for any sort of celebration because they will definitely make you feel at home and welcomed."

- Spending 1200 dollars on crappy Restoration Hardware table showing fading after 2 days
- Spending $300 bucks in this establishment for the worst Steak ever served by man!

I have been to many Steak houses over the years and I know good steaks. Perhaps I am old school but I don&#39;t use A1 sauce. In my book, a good Steak should be able to stand on its on flavor and declare to the world that its great..That said, I&#39;m not going to waste your time even talking about the meat served to us and the lack of flavor. It was just terrible.The sides, not much better ) - :

I wish I could say nice things about the staff but I cant. For the most part, everyone was dry and behaved as if someone just shot their dog. The waitress was slow and not helpful. I still gave her a good tip in hopes she would smile at some point later that evening after we left. I will give credit to the ladies at the front desk and the valet service as they all seemed to be very nice.

There are only five of us, so this saved my mom a lot of stress from the usual week long prep. 

Dinner was excellent. My dad and I enjoyed the Thanksgiving dinner price fixe. It was $40. I got the Caesar salad, it was excellent, and he got the lobster bisque which he enjoyed. We both raved about the turkey and the gravy. I thought the gravy was amazing! He ordered the creamed spinach, I tried it and it&#39;s not my cup of tea, and I order the mashed potatoes. They were excellent, garlicky and so smooth. There was also stuffing and cranberry on the plate. Both were good. We got our pumpkin cheesecake desserts to go, I liked it very much two days later. 
My son also did the kids thanksgiving, he loved his turkey. We got him Mac n cheese as a side, that was a bust. It had jalapeño flavor. He hated it, and honestly, I didn&#39;t really like it either, I would ask to substitute fries next time. He loved the vanilla ice cream part of the dessert. 

My mom and husband ordered the other fixe. She the 11oz filet and thought it was delicious, he the 6oz filet and shrimp. There were three shrimp and the portion was small for him. He wished he would have gotten what she did because he enjoyed the meat so much. They both did the house salad and the same sides mentioned earlier. Their dessert was different: a turtle cheesecake with a cranberry bark. The bark was good and the cheesecake was okay. The pumpkin was more to my liking. 

We all liked the bread and butter, but tried not to overindulge on it. I had the moscato, very good if you like a sweet wine and my husband and dad got cocktails. They were appropriately stiff. 

The atmosphere was loud. Not very easy to talk to, but spirited with lots of families filling the dining room. Our server, Tiffany, was so pleasant. She was helpful and attentive. 

I enjoyed my time very much. It&#39;s an expensive substitute to home cooked Thanksgiving, but enjoyable at the same time. Next time I want to do happy hour in the bar. That&#39;s looks affordable and tasty."

This last visit on Christmas Day was no different than any other visit. We had reservations at 12:30 and were seated promptly after we arrived. I had the Ruth Classic filet and shrimp combo, it came with a salad and side of mashed potatoes. The steak was seared and grilled perfectly! For dessert I upgraded to the bread pudding which was enough for 3! Service was on point and what you&#39;d expect at a high end steak house. What surprised me was that the server said that had reservations for more than 700 on Christmas Day! I guess no one cooks anymore!"

Ambiance: We were seated in their special event room, which had the tackiest decor, and made us feel like we were at a cheap buffet instead of an upscale steakhouse. Our table was also in the main walkway for all the staff and patrons to walk through. Of our party of 4, 2 of us were being constantly knocked into every time someone passed us (every 2 minutes). 

Service: Decent service from the waiter, until we requested to change tables because we kept being hit by people walking by, then he cared less about us :/

Food: This is where I was truly disappointed, because we have been here before, and the food was memorable. We ordered the chicken, steak, lobster tail, lobster mac and cheese, crab cakes, creamed spinach, and potatoes au gratin. Chicken was flavorless and dry, steak was good except we ordered it medium well and it came medium, lobster tail was dry and overcooked, lobster mac and cheese was bizarre (it seemed to have canned Rotel green peppers or jalepenos and tasted more like bad velveeta queso dip instead of mac and cheese), crab cakes were mostly bread/filling and not enough crab, creamed spinach was a disturbing puree of green goo, and the potatoes au gratin were dry!!!!! Why!!!! :/ 

This was a birthday celebration, and it disappointed us. The food should have been outstanding instead of turning into a bad Yelp review. Save your $$ and go elsewhere."

The good: helpful and knowledgable waitress, delicious steak and sides, yummy chocolate duo dessert. 

The bad: waiting area is FREEZING! We arrived a few minutes early and waited by the host stand. The door kept opening and blowing cold air in. The bar was just as cold! There were several young kids in the restaurant, but nothing too disruptive.  Many people were taking pictures during their meals, with flashes. That was more disruptive than the kids. After dinner, we noticed that every other table got a rose for the woman at the table- everyone but us. That was kind of a bummer. 

I&#39;d return for the food, but wouldn&#39;t stay if I had to wait for a table. I&#39;d probably pick another steak restaurant over this one."

I came for my second time, both on Chicago Restaurant Week.  This year they seem to have a focus on profit, and not quality.  For the low price of $44 a person you receive a small nearly tepid warm lobster bisque that makes you wish it was a full serving.  The steak, a filet in my case, was an end piece that was rolled together to resemble an actual filet.  This mangled mess that was presented would be fair for a steak worth $10, it did however come on a hot sizzling plate.  Wow, well I guess a hot plate is worth the up charge?  The dessert came, a little puck of chocolate that had no feeling of quality to it.  I would have been happy to pay $15 for the meal.  

Stop doing Restaurant Week since you have clearly given up on a real enticing menu for it.  I&#39;m disappointed, the point is to gain customers by showing them what you can do.  Instead, I will not be back unless someone else fronts the bill."

Starting out right away I did not like several things.  Choice of napkin color?  Huh?  How am I supposed to answer that?  Choice of water?  Really?  Who cares? It was also a bit too dark inside, hard to read the menu.  The prices are astronomical.  My scalloped potatoes were hard and covered in so much cheese, it was so globby and hard in areas I choked on it at one point.  Just not a good dish.  I have had way better steaks at many places. The dessert, a chocolate torte or cake with graham cracker crust, was too sweet and a weird texture.  I had to squint to find any graham crackers, which was the main reason I ordered this.  Normally chocolate + grahams= good but not in this case.  
Service and drinks were excellent and stellar!  Great job there.  Although I didn&#39;t need the server to keep explaining where things were in the menu.  I can read! I have only been here twice now because I had gift cards and would never return."

What I can tell you is that for me, this is one of those restaurants that is for special occasions only. The other high reviews are spot on. The ambience was classy and sophisticated. I was glad I wore a button up shirt and dress shoes and didn&#39;t go with anything too causal, as I would have felt out of place.

The service was personal, professional, and informative. Our server was confident and knowledgeable and it felt like he was being genuine and not just selling himself for a good tip.

The food was excellent. We both had the filet with shrimp combination and we agreed that this could be some of the best meat we&#39;ve ever sampled. Even our sides (mushrooms and mashed potatoes) were well portioned and flavorful.

So why not 5 stars? Well, the price point of this restaurant makes it one I will not be able to visit very often. If I can come again and verify that another item on the menu is of the same quality, and the service is consistent and not just a lucky surprise, I would easily bump this up to a 5 star experience.

I just need to save up, and give Ruth&#39;s Chris another shot... hope it&#39;s sooner than later."

First time dining in Ruth&#39;s Chris some years back, I was really impressed. It was the first time I got that Ritz Carlton treatment at a restaurant. Everybody called me by my name and they ushered me to my table like I was the Queen of England. It was pretty cool. 

Service has always been the number one thing here and I always received stellar service. I visited this location the most because again it was close to my work at the time and we did tons of business dinners here. Christi was my go to gal and she was more than awesome in handling our private events here. She remembered me even after awhile and if I were to tell her I was coming in for a personal dinner, she with no fail would send a surprise treat. It was so nice and very memorable.

The steaks itself are definitely delicious in general but it is not my all time favorite. They serve the steak on this really hot plate with melted butter and they warn you profusely about how hot it is. You can see it sizzling literally. However, it gets cold like in a flash. It&#39;s the weirdest thing for me. How could it be?

I did like their panzanella salad and the calamari as well. They also offer a pre fixe menu with three courses that&#39;s pretty reasonable in price. You get tons of food as well. It&#39;s not a bad choice if you&#39;re dining on budget and would be happy eating a standard smaller cut. If you&#39;re aiming for the grand daddy porterhouse, then go the a la carte way. Oh, they also have good mints. Not sure why but I really love their mints. 

I took my parents, sister, and niece here the last time I dined here. It was such a great time. With the abundance of choices for steakhouse, Ruth&#39;s Chris is definitely one of the nicer ones with guaranteed good service. At least, my experience here had always been great and that&#39;s why I still come back here once in a great while."

This is pretty much a special occasion restaurant seeing as everything is ala carte unless you opt for the Ruth&#39;s Classic Dinner starting at $43.95.  When it&#39;s just me for a girl&#39;s night out, I would splurge from time to time for this price, but for my family of three with all of their upgrades/substitutions, I think we will keep this to a special occasion spot.

Both visits were for dinner and the restaurant is dimly lit - very romantic actually.  The large booths are walled in so you are not listening to your neighbor&#39;s conversation...although we did smell their delicious menu options a few times on the most recent visit.  Everything is just very nice.  White linen napkins are on the table, but when you are seated, the host or hostess will immediately offer you a black napkin in the event you are wearing dark clothing to avoid the white lint.  It&#39;s a nice touch.  

There are many options on the menu to suit pretty much everyone I know.  We tried some of their calamari and it was tossed in a sweet &amp; tangy sauce with roasted red peppers.  Of everything we tried, this was the least exciting dish to hit the table, but it was still good.  I&#39;ve tried their chicken and tortellini soup as well as their corn chowder.  I love a good soup and both of these hit the spot.  The chowder boasted crispy bacon, fresh corn, chunk of potatoes (or maybe cauliflower, but I don&#39;t think so) and a wonderfully luscious base.  Their steaks are served on 500 degree plates...don&#39;t touch that!  About halfway through my steak, I usually flip it over on the plate to distribute the heat.  It&#39;s probably not doing anything, but I like to think it is.    We&#39;ve had their mashed potatoes, the loaded baked potato and the lyonnaise potatoes.  I enjoy the sautéed onions in the lyonnaise potatoes.  Plus dessert is always a winner!  Their chocolate cake is light and fluffy.  It&#39;s absolutely scrumptious!

Overall, for a chain steakhouse, it is very good.  The wait staff are trained very well and I truly don&#39;t have any complaints."

What&#39;s even better is that service was top notch.  Ginette was our server for the night and she was spot on with her service for our dinner.  She was super nice to us and very accommodating, even our 1 year old daughter liked her.

Our steaks were absolutely delicious, but what else would you expect from Ruth&#39;s Chris?  My wife&#39;s steak was over cooked and the Manager Chris fixed the problem for us immediately.  she had ordered a Medium and it came out Medium well to well done, yuck!  He actually bagged up the steak for us and sent us out a new steak, which was slightly under cooked this time, but better than being over cooked!

Probably the only downside to the dinner was that the sides weren&#39;t all that amazing, but they were still quite serviceable.  We ordered mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and mushrooms.  Nothing spectacular, but we were there for steak.

Overall, I was quite impressed with the service here at Ruth&#39;s Chris, and the steak I had was awesome.  This place is quite pricey for steaks, but you&#39;d definitely be pleased after the meal is done.  Thanks again to Ginette and Corey for absolutely wonderful dinner service."

We love this place so much that we incorporated celebrating our anniversaries at Ruth&#39;s Chris into our wedding vows!! Everything was on point. From our drinks to our dinner to the anniversary message written on our dessert plates. 

We each got the Ruth&#39;s classics and it&#39;s a great deal considering all that you get. My husband got the larger filet and I told him it would probably be an 8oz filet; wrong!! He was pleasantly surprised when we were told it was 11oz. I got the filet and lobster tail and the only problem with it was that there wasn&#39;t more! The sides were awesome and plentiful. I do wish that I had ordered my filet medium rare instead of medium but now I have something to look forward to next year.

Jovandi was our server and he was incredibly attentive without being overbearing. From the time he greeted us and told us Happy Anniversary to the very end of the meal, he was an amazing server. I can&#39;t write more positive things to say about this restaurant. I just wish that our anniversary could be monthly instead of yearly!"

Our server was awesome, however the food left a lot to be desired. The steak was overdone and not seasoned and the potatoes that came with it were also not seasoned. We told our waiter that we weren&#39;t very impressed with the food and he gave us a complimentary dessert of a little fruit sorbet and that was fine. The real problem here is that if I&#39;m going to be paying that much money for a steak, it better be damn impressive! The whole meal, really, should surpass my expectations if the bill is going to be that high. I was hoping for much better things at this restaurant."

For our anniversary, I booked a table through Yelp/OpenTable and put in the notes that we were celebrating our anniversary. Sure enough, the hostess and our waitress (Ana) congratulated us on our anniversary. Very nice touch! We were seated in a quiet booth.

Service was excellent, Ana was very attentive and even made some good menu suggestions. Drinks (French martini and New-Fashioned) were excellent. My wife and I both ordered the petite filets (both perfectly cooked, mine with peppercorn sauce), au gratin potatoes (very good), and asparagus with hollandaise. Everything was perfectly cooked and hot.

We ordered the creme brulee, based on our waitress&#39;s suggestion, but also because it&#39;s one our favorite desserts. They surprised us with writing Happy Anniversary on the plate! 

All around a very nice experience and definitely something we will consider for our next anniversary or special occasion!"

We had never been to this location, but I definitely think it&#39;s my favorite. The decor was very nice and more modern than the other locations. Our server was friendly and acknowledged we were celebrating a special occasion. I got the Ruth&#39;s classics; I started with the steak house salad which was VERY good. My filet and shrimp was delicious as well. I got the special side as my side, which was fire roasted corn, but I hated it. It was more like a salsa and not at all what I expected. We also got the Lyonaise potatoes, which were good but not as good as Perry&#39;s or Joe&#39;s. My fiance enjoyed his filet as well. We upgraded the dessert that came with the classic for $4 to get the chocolate cake and it was awesome. I was surprised we were not offered a free dessert or that the fee was waived since it was a celebration because they usually do that, but oh well. We came because my fiance loves it here and we had a gift card, but I definitely think Ruth&#39;s Chris has dropped on my list of steak houses."

My husband and I have been working SOOOOOO hard lately that we have spent very little time together. Earlier in the week he asked me &#34;What are we doing Friday?? To which I decide that we are having a date night. We have barely seen each other and I have missed him.

While at work the day before, I asked the guys where I could take the hubby for dinner that he might enjoy? I know...the irony that the resident Yelper is asking others for advice. After talking with a group of guys with appetites similar to my husband&#39;s, I hopped on Yelp to see if I could make a quick reservation at RCSH which was one of their recommendations and wouldn&#39;t you know it...a few moments later, we had a dinner planned.

I honestly hadn&#39;t even looked at the menu and I don&#39;t like to read other people&#39;s reviews before I go so that I allow myself to form my own opinions so I really kinda went into our date night blind. We pulled in to the Arboretum. Damn, I know it&#39;s in here somewhere. You may need to drive around a bit but head toward the center of the Arboretum and find Mago...it&#39;s behind Mago facing 72. Being a Friday during Lent, we found parking pretty quickly right in front of LL Bean. A short walk and we made our way into this simple-looking building. Greeted by the valet holding the door for us and two lovely ladies at the hostess stand, we were seated immediately. 

I immediately loved the whole feel of Ruth&#39;s Chris! The lighting, the polite staff, the comfortable chairs, the WALL of wine, and the scent of beef filled the air. The hostess promptly mentioned that the white linen napkins can leave lint on dark clothing and offered us black napkins instead. Both wearing black and dark jeans (yes, you can wear jeans here), we gladly accepted the black napkins. Thank you RCSH for your thoughtfulness. Its these types of things that make me fall in love with a place. She mentioned Stacey would be our server and moments later, Stacey appeared at our table, smile in tact.

We breezed through the menu and quickly decided on their Ruth&#39;s Classic dinner. Although we chatted thoroughly with Stacey about their menu and cuts of meat, we still opted for their special dinner options because you were able to get a little of this and a little of that so we could mix it up and share. Starting at $42.95, you get to select a soup or salad, entree, side and a sample dessert of their coconut and pineapple bread pudding. I selected the chicken tortellini soup, 6 oz. filet with shrimp, mashed potatoes and the hubby chose the steakhouse salad with italian dressing, green beans with garlic and a 14 oz. ribeye.

First, I must say that the soup&#39;s temperature was not served to my liking but they quickly resolved this issue and brought me a much hotter soup. My hubby and I enjoyed their warm bread and butter and he really liked his salad. While it was simple, it was very good. We shared our sides that were both perfectly prepared. Green beans a little al dente and mashed potatoes nicely mashed. Almost as good as mine! Every bite was better than the last. Our steaks are served on 500 degree plates ensuring they are hot from start to finish. Seasonly with salt, pepper, parsley and butter. Simple, elegant, nothing more needed. I could have cut my filet with the side of my fork. I almost attempted it but then realized that I might burn my hand (more than I already did because yes, I touched the plated even after getting a lecture about the temperature of it and how we should be VERY CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH THE PLATES!). 

I did ask Stacey right upfront when we sat down to space out the meal and she truly did an excellent job of doing just that. So thank you, Stacey!!
The meal was spaced out perfectly. We had plenty of time for each course. Stacey allowed us to sit and enjoy each bite.

I sipped on a Ginger snap lemon drop martini (I think I got that name right?) after dinner that packed a punch and was worth the 12 bucks. 

RC is not for money conscious. We kinda threw caution to this wind on this one but we came for an experience and they delivered. We will definitely be back!"

- 2 raspberry rosemary cosmo - delicious, i dont drink often but the alcohol flavor was masked extremely well

- stuffed mushrooms with crab - 4 pieces, big mushrooms, delicious
-fiance had the Ruth&#39;s classic - winter veg soup, mashed potatoes, and ribeye. The soup was demolished with a blink of an eye. The steak was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were average.

-I had the 6 oz. sirloin with crab legs - this steak is on my list as one of the best steaks i&#39;ve ever had. It was cooked perfectly, flavorful, juicy. The crab legs were seasoned well with the garlic butter. 

-side of au gratin potatoes - looks plain, but tasted better than the mashed potatoes
-chocolate lava cake w/ice cream - the worst part of the meal. the cake was too chocolatey and powdery.

I had a complete meal as my leftover. The waitress we had was extremely helpful in recommending things for us to try. I would go back for a special occasion, just cant justify the price. We spent about 170 with tax and tip."

I&#39;d be giving 3 stars, however the serving staff who attended our table were adept, and as you&#39;ll read, the manager caught a Hail Mary pass.

First, the Cosmo, shaken at the table by the server was big and very good. Always a great start! After that there were a few problems and observations.

Suggestion to management: don&#39;t let kitchen staff transport armloads of six packs of beer and buckets of ice through your dining room during the dinner hour. In a pinch, a trip or two might be ok, but they came by our location with kitchen/bar chores so often that I half expected them to wheel out trash through the dining room. Running numerous back of house errands through the front of the house--at dinner hour no less--is something I have never seen at a fine dining restaurant.

The food:

My Ribeye ordered medium came well done. Great piece of meat, and I can eat a well done steak, if it&#39;s an nice a piece as the one they gave me, but it wasn&#39;t what I ordered. Not even close. Something like a $44 steak should at least be close to your order...IN A STEAK HOUSE.

Potatoes au gratin were somewhere between send-them-back undercooked, and just-eat-them. So we just ate them. Cheesy and for sure you could eat them, but obviously not quite done. Asparagus with bearnaise sauce: the sauce was perfect,  the asparagus was the skinny kind and too fibrous to eat at the last couple of inches. Either serve better or trim them better. 

The bone in filet was ordered medium rare and came out perfectly. That should be harder to cook than a ribeye given how thick it is, but they served a wonderful filet, cooked perfectly. Not an easy feat.

Chocolate explosion cake with ice cream is really a dessert for two...who knew, and it was very nicely presented and tasted good. Creme brule made my other half very happy. Coffee was good. Espresso came out tepid, not even close to hot.

So with all of the above, I was feeling mildly disappointed by this nearly $200 dining experience for two, and then the manager did his table touch. I really would have said nothing about my overcooked steak, but the manager really did seem sincerely interested in our experience. So I showed him the middle of my steak and he was very apologetic and insisted on giving me one properly cooked.

I had eaten 50% of this steak! And he still wanted to replace it which seemed unfair to me, as if I would be taking advantage. If you&#39;re sending back a steak, you don&#39;t eat half of it first. So the manager told me he&#39;d be bringing me out a ribeye cooked correctly, and packed to go.

Wow. That really impressed me and definitely raised my satisfaction level on the overall experience. So, no 3 stars review here. Four stars earned."

We had looked at the menu ahead of time and made reservations. We arrived right at the time of our reservation and seated right away. I was a little disappointed we had a table rather than a booth, but it wasn&#39;t a big deal. The atmosphere is modern, classy and intimate. Our waiter was very professional and introduced us to his assistant for the evening. When we opened the menus we both were surprised to see a birthday message for my boyfriend at the top! We both ordered martinis...The Raspberry Rosemary and the Ginger Coconut Lemon Drop. Both were very good! We ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and really enjoyed those as well. For dinner my boyfriend did a ribeye, I did lobster tails and a filet and then we split the au gratin potatoes and asparagus. To me, this was a bit disappointing that the dinner did not come with sides and they had to be ordered separately. All the food was great and the side dishes were perfect portions for sharing. My boyfriend then got a free dessert since it was his birthday. He opted for the berries and cream. It was okay, but not a dessert I&#39;d order again. The cream was like a pudding but not as thick. It was almost like a soup with berries. Overall, the service was a bit slow especially being that our waiter had an assistant. The food was great! It was very pricey but we knew this going there since we had looked into the menu ahead of time. Not a place I would frequent just because of the prices; however, a place that is nice for a special occasion."

Lobster bisque was cold -very small portion and not that great.  Two people at the table had Chilean sea bass and both portions were extremely fishy-we could all smell it at the table.  Over all a very disappointing experience-we will never frequent this restaurant again-much better restaurants at a lower price point.

The staff was amazing and catered to all our needs swiftly. The glasses were never void of water, and they even went out of their way for a bit extra. 

The Caesar salad was no different than any other place in the area, except for the price. It was about 3 times more. The same goes for the sides. We ordered the broccoli and potatoes au gratin, which were mediocre. The calamari was our appetizer and that was  just okay. Nothing out of the ordinary stood out.

My steak was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had, however. I got the ribeye and it was perfect. The cut was damn near perfect and I doubt it could&#39;ve been prepared any better.

Needless to say, I can think of a lot better ways to spend $450.00 on a meal for four."
ruths-chris-steak-house-south-barrington,Rose D.,FqHNMGc_-BgX4svll0SwLg,"Elgin, IL",1,1,1,241,719,n7bWEGqX8V9AgkLq8TJfgw,4.0,2013-06-03,"Best steak I&#39;ve ever had!  Sadly, due to the price tag we will not be visiting here often.  Since it was a super-special occasion (my father-in-law&#39;s retirement!) we decided to splurge &amp; treat the inlaws to a really nice meal.

Do I think it was worth the hefty cost?  Yes and no.  The steaks are obviously quality and most are HUGE!  And as I said before, it was the best steak I&#39;ve ever had.  But I don&#39;t know why most high-end steakhouses have all their sides ala carte.  If you are paying hefty sum for a huge chunk of grilled meat they can at least throw in a potato of some form.  Potato &amp; a veggie would be better.

Okay, down to the nitty gritty:
-Steaks, cooked perfectly - so delicious they are only seasoned while cooking with salt &amp; pepper &amp; some parsley.  Oh, and it&#39;s served on a plate of melted butter.  Butter makes everything better!  Our table tried 3 different cuts: the Filet, the Ribeye &amp; the Porterhouse for 2.  Wow!

-Sides - while the sides are just enough for 2 people to share, I still think the price is a bit steep, ranging from $8 - $10.50.  We ordered the sweet potato casserole (hubby said it was a bit dry), mashed potatoes, broccoli au gratin &amp; the asparagus w/hollandaise.  We also tried the calamari as an appetizer.  I was worried it would be mushy since it is tempura fried but then tossed in an Asian-Chili sauce - surprisingly it was still perfectly crispy &amp; delicious!

-Drinks - they have a huge selection of wines, of course.  We tried a Pinot Gris &amp; a Malbec, both excellent.  They didn&#39;t have much of a selection of draft beers, however - leaving the men disappointed.

-Decor/Ambiance - gorgeous!  My mother-in-law and I were in love with each and every light fixture in this place.  I also liked how they had real candles around the restaurant.  They have those cozy, inset booths, too - which I love.  But I was glad we were seated by a table near a window as I know my inlaws would not have been able to read their menus in those darkened cozy booths.  AND it wasn&#39;t loud in here - just average noise level, but still able to hold a nice, polite conversation (we&#39;ve been to other &#34;fancy&#34; steakhouses &amp; the noise level is deafening).

-Reservations - My only gripe was we had a 7:15 reservation.  We arrived at 7:07 and were told it would just be a few minutes, no more than 15 minutes wait, for us to be seated.  Okay, I know we were a tiny bit early but perhaps they were packed already.  But no, they weren&#39;t!  When we were taken to our table 10 minutes after arriving we passed MANY empty tables for 4.  So I&#39;m not sure what the delay was but we were seated close to our rez time so oh well.  

-Service - the rest of the service was outstanding!  The gentleman who would fill our water and bring bread to the table was very gracious.  Our server, Gina, was very friendly and informative.  The lady who brought our wine (and I wish I could remember her name) was a hoot!  So friendly and funny.  I liked how everyone (aside from those at the front desk) were very down-to-Earth &amp; fun, not pretentious at all.

-Last, but not least...we had declined coffee or dessert since we had a special dessert waiting for my father-in-law at home.  But, our server Gina surprised us and still brought out a lovely little dessert sampler with &#34;Happy Retirement&#34; written in chocolate sauce on the platter!  There were 3 little ramekins: vanilla bean ice cream, warm chocolate brownie &amp; I believe a bread pudding, complete with a candle in it.  Just enough for us each to take a bite of each. :-)  It was the perfect way to cap off the evening."
ruths-chris-steak-house-south-barrington,Michelle F.,QR8XFFHYU-X0epXOrDbrXw,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,1,165,12,ljjURzjKWMluZDM1fzBpxQ,5.0,2013-06-04,"Rarely do I ever go to a restaurant and think &#34;I can&#39;t wait to go home and write a review&#34;.  But this was not a review I needed to &#34;sit on&#34;.  I wanna shout it from the rooftops and I don&#39;t care who knows it!!!!

Alright, so first of all, service is top notch.  I made the reservation for two on Opentable.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to call a mere twenty minutes before our 6:30 reservation time and see if they were able to accommodate two (little) guests at our supposed-to-be-romantic-dinner.  The woman who answered the phone was amazing and said it was no problem!!  Bless her heart, because my taste buds were set for steak!!  We might have been a little crazy, but rather than cancel our reservation, we took a HUGE gamble and took our six-year old and our three-year old to dinner with us.  And let me make this perfectly clear--Ruth&#39;s Chris could not have been more accommodating.  

After arriving and being seated (kids coloring booklets and menus provided!) we were greeted by our wonderful server, Nina.  I learned more about steak from her than I have ever known before.  She answered all of my stupid questions about different cuts of meat and suggested delicious cocktail pairings.  Nina talked to my kids like they were little people--so much so that my daughter turned to me at the end of the meal and said &#34;Mommy, I wish she was part of our family&#34;. :)  Waitresses like Nina are few and far between nowadays!!

They had a whole huge craft beer list (which my beer-snob husband appreciated!) and I ordered the Raspberry Rosemary Cosmo and he got the Dragon&#39;s Milk.  Actually, he got two.  And my Cosmo was VERY strong with just the one, thankyouverymuch!

Now onto the food!!
Thanks to Nina&#39;s advice, we knew we didn&#39;t want a &#34;marble cut&#34; but rather, a filet.  So my husband and I ordered one steak among the two of us, and a bunch of sides and an appetizer.

**Stuffed Mushrooms: A-MA-ZING.  I love everything mushrooms.  My husband hates everything mushrooms.  But I was not going to pass up the opportunity to order my favorite appetizer in such a fancy schmancy place :)  So I did, and they did NOT disappoint.  My daughter has never really cared for stuffed mushrooms in the past, either, but even SHE ate them (and, ahem, dipped the bread into the garlic butter at the bottom...as did I...moving on).  The crab stuffing in there was amazing!!  I give it an A!

**Harvest Salad: My husband ordered this, and I snuck a couple of bites.  I *love* salad, and this one did not disappoint.  But c&#39;mon now, you can&#39;t ever be mad at a salad with bacon on it, lezjustbehonest.

**Petite Filet:  In one word: In-freaking-credible.  It was the most tender and delicious cut of meat I have ever had and that I probably ever will have.  It was cooked perfectly, and they were nice enough to split it onto two separate plates because they knew my husband and I were splitting.  That was a really nice touch!  But one very important tidbit about this steak--no knives needed:
I
Could
Cut
It
With
A
Fork.

Nuff said.

**The sides were ordered were the broccoli au gratin and the loaded baked potato.  Both were really good, and complimented the steak really well!  I would definitely get both of them again!

**Chocolate Explosion: Of COURSE we had dessert...  We knew we would probably have to be rolled out of there, but it was WELL worth it!  I think this was one of the best cakes I have ever had in my life.  It was hot, delicious, and had just the right balance of chocolate to ice cream.  It was the perfect ending to an amazing evening!!

So all in all, this was a really amazing dining experience.  It&#39;s not somewhere you could go all the time, but I am already trying to figure out my next occasion to visit again.  

And I will definitely be requesting Nina--I&#39;ve never had such amazing service!  She was there when we needed her (but never hovering) and we were never left waiting for anything--she was really on top of it all!  I am really impressed!

I will definitely be back again!"

We ordered of the special &#39;Chicago restaurant week&#39; menu.  The lobster bisque that was &#34;included&#34; in the price was awful.  The serving was less than half the normal amount.  The lobster pieces were literally cold and the bisque itself was slightly less than lukewarm.
Once again, my steak was awful.  I ordered a ribeye pittsburg rare (charred outside, rare inside).  The outside was barely browned, far from charred.  The inside was indeed rare.  I realize a ribeye is marbled and I enjoy that about a ribeye.  This one was sinewy, ultra fatty, and not one cut of the knife yielded an edible piece of meat.
The dessert that was also &#39;included&#39; was a round hockey puck of chocolate, clearly mass-produced like something you get on a cheap cruise line.

I didn&#39;t complain because I didn&#39;t want to make an issue of it in front of my client.

One of the best steaks I have ever had... the simplicity of salt, pepper, parsley, and tons of butter is a must for an excellent steak.  My filet was cooked perfectly, as was my husbands New York Strip.  They literally melt in your mouth.  Mashed potatoes on the side were creamy and garlic-ly, the best way to have them.  And our calamari appetizer??  OMG we scarfed it down... sweet spicy sauce with added sauteed red peppers.  At first I was upset there wasn&#39;t anything to dip them in, but there was plenty of sauce on the pieces.  The calamari appetizer is definitely meant for 4 people, but we had no problem clearing off that plate.

Is it expensive?  Yes, but its worth it, especially for special occasions.  I know the hubs and I aren&#39;t going to make this a weekly visit.  It does annoy me, as others have said, that steakhouses make their sides ala carte and definitely at the hefty price, I mean $9.50 for potatoes is pretty steep.  I guess we just take it with a grain of salt cause we dine like this only two or three times a year and one side is big enough for 2 people.

Our server, John was really great.  Very informative and super friendly.  Not in your face 24/7, but always checking in to see how we were doing.  The room we were in was fantastic as well, very cozy and probably sat around 30-40 people.  Not insanely dark, but still had a romantic feel to it.  Also, not as noisy as Wildfire or Ditkas.  

Another great aspect to Ruth&#39;s Chris is the location. I love this mall, tons of eateries and cute shops, not to mention iPic.  If you want a great date night out, do a combo of Ruth Chris and iPic."

We were promptly seated in an ample sized booth on the perimeter of the main dining room which afforded us the privacy for great conversation without distractions and attentive service.

The food and drink was A+ starting with a large plate of fried calamari with an incredible Thai chili-red pepper sauce.  We then shared a Ceasar salad before getting down to what we came for:  the &#34;meat and potatoes&#34;.  Our filets (what else at R&#39;s C) were exactly as ordered, mine with grilled shrimp on top.  The seafood was a worthy companion my petite filet on the hot china.

I made them a few weeks in advance. We arrived on time but were told to take a seat. We were there for my boyfriends birthday and I really wanted to make it special. Four groups arrived after us and were seated before us. Finally at 8:05 my boyfriend asked the hostess why we hadn&#39;t been seated yet. She didn&#39;t apologize and just said we&#39;d be seated next. Then she turned to another worker and started snickering. I tried not to think anything of it but honestly it was extremely unproffessional and off putting. 

We waited around another few minutes then left. We were hungry and now annoyed and the evening was close to ruined. I couldnt believe how rude they were and we wont be attempting to go back. This was the worst customer service ive evet experienced.

While my steak was cooked to perfection, I was paranoid that it would slide off the tiny plate and onto the floor/my lap. Still, my steak was excellent (ordered out the salt), and I liked all of the food I tried.  I wanted a little more variety on the appetizers.  The strawberry basil gimlet was kind of blah.

We started with calamari, seared tuna and stuffed mushrooms.  The calamari was great, seared tuna was pretty delicious, and stuffed mushrooms were decent.  The cocktails we had with dinner were pretty weak.  At $12 a pop, they really should put more alcohol in these.

The service was great and friendly throughout the whole dinner.  However, the steaks must&#39;ve been sitting there a while as they were not sizzling.  Mine in particular was swimming in butter (a little butter glaze is great, but there should not be a pool on my plate).  The cut of meat was not very good, though I&#39;d ordered a ribeye there were a lot of tendon and grisle material.  The sear was not good at all.  This is definitely not the steak I remembered last time I went to a Ruth Chris, though this was in Arizona.

My mother had the chilean bass and this was overly salted.  She couldn&#39;t much of it at all.  

The sides were worse than I remembered as well - the sauteed mushrooms were gigantic.  I think they used the same ones they use for stuffed mushrooms.  I thought they usually used the smaller button mushrooms, or maybe I&#39;m thinking of Mastro&#39;s?

The bread pudding we got for dinner was just a dense piece of sponge cake or something.  Not very good at all.

All in all, this was not the first impression I wanted to give my parents of Ruth Chris.  We maybe should have driven the extra ten minutes to go to the one in the city.  Or maybe I&#39;ll wait to treat them in Scottsdale."

My better half was jacked... he had been looking at the online menu for days and talked about it almost non-stop. He had been to a Ruth&#39;s Chris Steak House before and was excited to get his hands on a piece of meat again. 

My expectations were much lower. Last year, on our Anniversary, we went to Jameson&#39;s Steak House in C&#39;ville... our meal was not good and soon after, the place closed. So, I was worried.

We had a reservation at 5:00 for two... we arrived at 5:00 and we were seated immediately. I ordered a filet with bleu cheese crust, sweet potato casserole and lobster bisque. The hubbster ordered a filet, mashed potatoes, mushrooms and lobster bisque.

The Lobster Bisque was AMAZING. When it arrived, I noticed there was a big chunk of lobster in the bowl... I wasn&#39;t sure if I should mix it into the bisque or not... I decided to save &#34;the best for last&#34; and eat the bisque first. I was so surprised to find that the lobster chunk was not the only lobster in the bowl. There were other chunks floating around in the bowl. Ah-Maze-Ing.

The filet was also out of this world... I ordered it medium rare... it came to the table more rare than medium rare however, the plate are so damn hot the filet cooked up to it&#39;s medium rare status in no time. It was fantastic. It melted in my mouth. The blue cheese crust was a wonderful addition.  

The Sweet Potato Casserole was just okay. I make a mean sweet potato casserole every year for Thanksgiving (my husband often tells people he married me for my sweet potato casserole) and Ruth&#39;s Chris casserole was not even close to the goodness of my own recipe. The hubbies mashed potatoes and mushrooms were seriously delicious. I mis-ordered. 

Believe it or not, we decided to order dessert. The hubby ordered the bread pudding and I ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake. The cheesecake was good but I was so full, I couldn&#39;t fully enjoy it. My hub loved the bread pudding. Loved it!

Ruth&#39;s Chris was a wonderful dining experience. It was quite expensive but I enjoyed it so much, I am already making plans to get back there.

Oh, and our waitress was amazing. Top notch and exactly how waitresses are supposed to be."

First let me say this restaurant deserves at least a 3 star for service.  We went for the classic dinner where it was a three course meal; we both ordered steaks - a filet (medium)  and a 16 oz ribeye (med. rare).  I ordered the the golden beets and green salad way too much dressing which I did not finish.  My husbands filet came out so rare that he had to send it back so for the next 12 mins I sat eating my dinner while he nibbled on the sides.  The steaks were not impressive I have had so much better. I think the only big notice is that when they serve the steaks on a 500 degree plate it sizzles when it&#39;s brought to the table. 
 
Our bill was close to $135 and the meal didn&#39;t tempt us to come back for another visit.  
Having said all this about the food - the service was very good, our waiter was attentive and the other staff members were there when the beverages needed to be refreshed.
Would we come back? No, sorry nothing memorable about this restaurant except the overpriced meals."

Food 4.5 - We ordered three different cuts. The steaks were cooked perfectly, although the cuts could use some improvement. Ribeye was a little salty to me; but otherwise, no complains. Lobster Bisque was good, but I had better ones elsewhere. Same for the salad and dessert. 

Service 3.5 (maybe 3) - The hostess was not friendly at all (looked like she was the &#34;snooty older lady&#34; the other reviewer mentioned in her post). Our server was good, but not the best. I think she needs a little more time management training esp. on a busy weekend night. After we finished our entries and the leftover got wrapped by the other staff, we sat there staring at our empty table with just our drink glasses for about 30 minutes before our server finally came back asking us about dessert, which we expected it to be served fairly quickly as it was part of the classic dinner we ordered.

Felt like the servers and the manager were more attentive to certain tables (maybe the regulars seeing how they greeted each other). The manager never came asking our table like what he did for many others. Well, again, when we were leaving, there was the same weirdness or coldness on the hostess&#39;s face. No friendly &#34;goodbye&#34; or anything. For an upscale steakhouse like this, I would certainly expect more esp. on the service part."

The lobster mac and cheese, even though I was hesitant not being a seafood eater was amazing, the make it with these green chilies,ugh melt in your mouth. But everything was melting in my mouth.

Friday night treat.  I had the petite filet, medium well, along with the asparagus with hollandaise sauce. The steak was done perfectly, which made me very happy, as I usually either get it over or underdone. The asparagus was tender and very tasty.  My wife had the stuffed chicken breast, which she said was deliciious.  She ordered a salad, and didn&#39;t realize there was cream in the dressing.  Our server very generously substituted the chicken tortellini soup, which was excellent.  Dessert was cheesecake with fresh berries, and it was tremendous.

They have a very good selection of craft beers, and the wine list looked very good, too.  This is not an every weekend kind of place, definitely special occasion, but certainly worth the price!"

Being that it was Christmas Day, our restaurant choices were limited.  We made a reservation for 7:15PM for 2, we arrived at 7:10PM to a chaotic hosting desk.  They were understandably busy, we were told it would be a few minutes so we stood off to the side of the hostess desk.  15 minutes went by and I hear another couple given the same few minutes wait time for their 7:30PM reservation.  We wait another 10 minutes and to my disbelief the couple with the reservation at 7:30PM who arrived after us, gets called to be seated.  Trying to stay calm, I ask when we will be seated, the hostess says we&#39;re next(this is a familiar incident mentioned in at least 2 other help reviews).  By the time the hostess is walking us to our table, I am fuming.  As we are waiting to be seated, I begin to write my 1 star yelp review on my phone.  As we are being seated, I tell the hostess that I was extremely disappointed to see that other people with reservations after us and arrived after us were being seated first, reservations mean nothing to this place.  She had to good sense to send a manager over. 

So why the 5 star review?  The restaurant unexpectedly recovered from this incident throughout the night.  Ruth&#39;s Chris should really thank our waitress(Gina) for her great customer service.  Here is how they gained back their stars:
1. The manager came over and genuinely apologized, gave us a free appetizer.  
2. Our waitress was very friendly, gave us great suggestions and was very attentive to our needs.
3. The steak was delicious.  Perfectly done to the right temperature and it came out sizzling.
4. I saw our waitress on my way to the ladies room, I told her we were celebrating my boyfriend&#39;s unfortunate Christmas Day birthday, she promptly offered the dessert of our choice on the house.  

I still think the hosting process needs to be revamped here, I&#39;m not sure if reservations mean anything to them, they could have avoided having to give us free food, nonetheless, I would definitely come back here, probably not on a major holiday."

You obviously do not go here for the prices or the quick service, but Ruth&#39;s Chris does provide in many other ways.  First off, the steaks are freaking delicious.  They come to you on a sizzling hot plate of butter.  I could stop there and that alone would be worth 5 stars, but there are so many other reasons I love it here.  1) Not many places have good craft beer.  They do.  2) Every soup, salad, and side I have had here is awesome.  3) The blue cheese crust is the best I have ever had.  It&#39;s not a crumby excuse for a crust, but a full half-inch of blue cheese crumbles that are broiled on.  HELL YES.  4) The desserts are the bomb too.  

Now I am no fancy schmancy McPrissy Pants, but I also like that there is valet if you want it.  There are also black napkins for the classy folks who don&#39;t want white lint on their suits.  Nice touch, RC.  

I guess my point is that you can make this a fancy night out and pretend you are rich and famous or you can just go there for some good beer and a great steak.  Either way, you need to go."

Seating in the side banquet was intimate and quiet, something we value at any restaurant. Our server was gracious and attentive, even though it was apparent we were not regular customers. 
The lobster bisque started came with chunks of lobster floating in it, and was delicious. My husband, the true carnivore, had the Cowboy Steak, a 22 oz. strip steak on the bone. It was tender and served sizzling hot, and was a true medium, as requested. My strip steak was also perfectly done, nota do easy achievement with a thinner steak. And both steaks were perfectly seasoned. I almost always have to salt a steak, but not here! The sweet potato casserole side was good, but very sweet, making me wish I had ordered the creamed spinach instead. Our shared dessert, chocolate sin cake, was to die for. A flour less chocolate cake, it looks small when it comes out, but was rich enough for two people to enjoy. The only thing that would have improved it was a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

The filet came out juicy and tender and the ribeye was the same.

If you ever are wondering which sides to get, GET THE SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE!!!!! It&#39;s AWESOME! Little bits of pecan crunched into it and it has that type of crumble on the top that yo might expect on a pie, but this thing tops off the meal like no other.

The broccoli might be the only part of the meal that fell short of expectation, as it wasn&#39;t crunchy like most good broccoli I&#39;ve seen. Other than that, you get an awesome experience for going there!"

Time of my visit: Lunch

Let me start by saying, this was not my first time here...  I remembered why it took me this long to come back...  It might be awhile before I come back again...

I always liked little moms &amp; pops type places.  My first test is always to try the gyro.  I ordered gyro, fries and a drink.  Total came under $8 with tax, I thought that was reasonable.  My first reaction was to reach for my AMEX, oops they didn&#39;t take it.  That was a strike one!  Look, I get it, it&#39;s expensive to take that card, but either take them all or be a cash only.  They were busy, so it took them a few minutes to get to me.  I asked my order to be for here and instead I get it to go, at least they apologized.  Normally, it would not be a big deal, but I have yet to get my order correctly at this place (usually I get no onions on my gyro, since I have to go back to work, so either screw no onions up or something like for here or to go).

On to the food, the fries were average and nothing special.  Gyro meat was a bit dry and average.  I have had better gyros.

Honestly, I am not sure when I&#39;ll come back again, but I will try something else and some point, I just need to remember not to reach for my AMEX.  Overall C-."

I got a cheeseburger and fries with a horchata. Because I could. It set me back $6.72, which is nothing short of amazing if you keep track of beef prices like I do.

The burger was pretty good. It&#39;s hard for me to describe a run-of-the-mill, hole-in-the-wall burger without using more hyphens, so I&#39;ll just say that it was a good burger. Fresh lettuce and nice, melty cheese.

The fries tasted slightly off. I can&#39;t tell you how, because my wife didn&#39;t think they tasted off, but to me I thought maybe some of the flavors from other fried foods leaked into the oil.

The horchata was very, very good, cold, cinnamon-y and exactly what I was looking for.

Overall though, it&#39;s pretty difficult to beat Diana&#39;s - which, by the way, appears to be run by a Hispanic dude, and I wasn&#39;t sure if red hots were actually on the menu - at this price point. I&#39;d come back."

The service is super friendly. The food is always perfect. Everything is cooked to order so there is no cold food or old food!

The hot dogs are their specialty. Typical Vienna dog but they do it all so well. It comes with fries at no extra charge. I have had their gyros, tamales and as I mentioned hot dogs. All were good and I trust that everything else in there menu, which is huge by the way, is going to be just as good.

When you walk in you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s very hot inside as the cooking equipment is very closely packed into the front. When I went to Diana&#39;s I ordered the hot dog.

The hot dog comes with fries and is a skinless vienna beef dog. The bun was a regular non-poppy seed bun. The pickle was cut thinly but was not quite long enough to get pickle in every bite. It was light on mustard and relish but had a decent amount of onions. The relish included was not the neon green style found at most Chicago style hot dog joints, but wasn&#39;t too sour either. The peppers included weren&#39;t too hot and complimented the dog nicely. The bun wasn&#39;t particularly soft, but it wasn&#39;t hard either.

The fries included were thick, they were fairly cripsy on the outside and had a decent potato filling. They weren&#39;t too salty, but were a bit on the greasy side. 

Overall this was an average at best Chicago style hot dog. The light condiments, regular bun and so so fries included keep it from reaching the three star plateau. Not awful, but I&#39;ve definitely had better."

This place is a dive in and out joint, its small not too cozy but packs a punch in food and flavor. Their gyros are awesome, it is a very generous portion of meat, tomato, onion and &#34;gyro sauce&#34; as they like to refer to it, and if you order the plate (comes with fries and a drink) you&#39;ll definitely be walking away full (make sure to grab some Louisiana hot sauce for them fries mm mm). 

Their hot dogs and cheese steak sandwiches I would recommend next, the hot dogs are classic nothing extraordinary but their sandwiches are, I definitely recommend a try. Finally, their menudo on Saturday and Sunday is extremely tasty. Although sometimes they sell out quickly due to phone in orders, I got their today at 10:09 am (they open at 10 am) and they were already sold out, yeah its that good. 

Anyways, the location and setting can be a little off putting but the food and service is excellent I highly recommend this place if you like good food at a decent price. 

Oh yeah and they also serve good burritos and tacos. Check em out."

They have a fairly simple, easy-to-read menu with suggested burger creations and plenty of options to customize and make it your own. My husband and I usually pick out two and split them between us, each are 1/3 lb of beef. 

When you order your burger, you have the choice of beef or chicken breast. The chicken breast is large as well as juicy and equally tasty with the suggested sandwich toppings. I&#39;d recommend getting a side of fries with your burger as they don&#39;t come with it unless you order them. You have the option of original or cajun fries but be warned, the cajun fries are a bit more salty than other restaurant chains. 

If you&#39;re looking for an alternative to your normal fast-casual dining experience, give it a whirl. The self-serve Coca-Cola Freestyle is also available for your drinking enjoyment with free refills during your stay.

First, I came in here last week to buy a burger for my bf&#39;s brother, and neither then or today were we given a receipt. Today we spent almost 30 bucks for both of us, why is it assumed I don&#39;t want a receipt? We had to ask for it. (same guy both times, shorter Hispanic manager - he&#39;s wearing a headset and a collared shirt. If he checks you out, and you need a receipt, make sure to ask!) 

Today, I got a small meathead, bacon and Bleu cheese, with their new feta fries. The feta fries were good (my boyfriend said he was neutral on them), I think they needed a bit (more?) vinegar to compliment and balance out the flavors. 

My burger was good, it was juicy and I enjoyed it. However, the amount of Bleu cheese was shockingly little. It&#39;s $1 for cheese, listed as 2 slices. The amount of cheese I received is not the equivalent of 2 slices, and certainly not worth $1 -  maybe a quarter. My boyfriend order extra Bleu, and got less than I did. (I&#39;m including a photo of the amount of cheese I received). 

I can&#39;t bring myself to do 4 stars considering the receipt issue - we weren&#39;t even offered one, and the fact that I feel I was vastly overcharged/cheated regarding the Bleu cheese. My burger needed more cheese, or I should have been charged less. I&#39;m open to coming back, but as it stands, I&#39;ll never get Bleu cheese on a burger here again. Also, as my photo shows, my boyfriend&#39;s bunless burger dripped a shocking amount of grease. I understand that normally the grease gets absorbed by the bun, but it was like a river of grease - the only difference in our burgers was the lettuce bun and avocado. It was unappealing to watch, and if it had been my burger, I&#39;d have quit eating it."

On my second visit here, I had seen enough of the drive up to figure out where to go in, so I used it - the entry isn&#39;t marked too well. Now, the good thing about Meatheads is the freshness of their food and cooking it. Problem is that their style of cooking each order from the start doesn&#39;t lend itself too well to a drive up process. I was the &#34;first one&#34; in the drive up on my visit and the order took 7 minutes. I can only imagine how long the person 2 cars behind me ended up waiting.

We were seated right away (like stupid fast). Our waitress came over right away and asked what we wanted to drink. I had a margarita, my friend got a beer. The margarita was decent, not my favorite, but not bad. They have a variety of flavors and sizes, which is nice. 

They also have a large menu. Anything from tacos to fajitas, burritos, taco salad, enchiladas, you name it. I had the steak tacos (supreme), Mexican style. The flavor was great, and they were full of meat, cilantro and onion. IT did come with pico, guac, sour cream, beans, rice, and lettuce on the side. Next time I would just order 3 steak tacos with guac on the side and save myself some money. But they were good!

Service was great the whole time, I really don&#39;t have any complaints. Some of the prices are a little high, but overall I would definitely come back for my taco fix."

We had the large queso with chips, which was your standard white cheese. It was delicious! 

For my meal I had the Arizona burrito. The description listed that it included red peppers, onions, and tomatoes. Unfortunately, I was expecting it to be more small pieces but it was actually huge pieces of these vegetables. I requested only shredded chicken in my burrito for the meat. My burrito was practically only these large vegetables. So I was very disappointed, I wouldn&#39;t say it was their fault because it was how I interpreted the description. It really should be called the &#34;Fajita burrito&#34; that would be a more accurate description. 

The service was good and I was glad I was able to use the yelp coupon!"

So I&#39;m not even embarrassed to say that I did an extensive search online when we moved to the area. Good Tequila is the first place we tried and it&#39;s going to be tough to compete with. The white queso (which is hard to find around this region for some reason), had a little kick to it. Best I&#39;ve ever had. I don&#39;t care if white queso isn&#39;t as &#34;authentic&#34; as queso fundido. It&#39;s delicious. I ordered the large ($6.25?) having no idea how big it was. I weighed risk vs payoff. It was pretty big. Like a cereal bowl. Too much for two people, even if one of them is me. I wasn&#39;t disappointed though. Worth the risk. 

We got the 28 oz margaritas and had them made with Grand Marnier. I think they were around $13 each which is a good price. Especially since we were both one and done. Usually my husband and I will have a second, or split one at the very least. We like our margs. Don&#39;t judge. But we actually really didn&#39;t need more than one. 

We were in the mood for seafood so I got the special which was shrimp and crab enchiladas ($9.99) and my husband got the lobster enchiladas ($13.99?).  Both were very good. We will definitely repeat those orders some other time. I hope they make the shrimp and crab enchiladas a regular menu item. 

THEN, we got fried ice cream, which was also great. Better than expected. I think it was less $5. 
Our daughter loved it. And she&#39;s 2 so you know she has a refined palate. 

Not that it&#39;s part of Good Tequila&#39;s, but it should be mentioned that there&#39;s a fountain/splash area right outside past their ample patio seating which was a great place to hang out and watch out daughter play before we walked off all that food and drink!  

So clearly this is a rave. Go in and eat and drink until you can&#39;t move. I&#39;ll be logging extra time at the gym just to go here on a regular basis."

Atmosphere, staff, and service; premium.
Food quality is good, not as authentic as my Caucasian tongue prefers, but considering the location in the middle of suburbia, the food is pretty good. 

Guac is pretty a bit white washed, lacking spice and flavor. Their chicken is flavored very well. 

Since I like things with more of a spicy kick, the spice factor here is a little tame.

Sebastian is an outstanding representative of GTs establishment. The service is fast and impeccable. He remembered all of our orders, in which each order had at least 3 substitutions.

When their was a slight mix up on cooks end with the substitution, the quickly took care of the situation with out any rebuttals.

During lunch (11:30/noon for us) the salsa is bright and fresh.

We went for dinner today and the salsa was super salty.  I won&#39;t explore why this might be.  Use your own imagination.  We mentioned it to the server and he chuckled it off and asked if we would like another.  I don&#39;t imagine that someone is making this on demand so we decline.

The dinner menu is double the price of the lunch menu.  This isn&#39;t unusual but they are next to a Buffalo Wild Wings that does not charge $12-16 per plate so it looks like they don&#39;t understand their market.

My colleague and I had not been to Good Tequila&#39;s in a while, so we decided to go there.

Quiet it was.  We arrived for lunch right at noon and there were probably only three or four tables occupied.  Right next door is China Buffet which had a waiting line out the door.

The food was okay, not outstanding and a little more expensive than I think it was worth.  Two platters and cokes for lunch = $30.  A bit high.  

None the less, it was quiet, so we were able to get out work done. The service was outstanding (possibly because there was one wait staff for every occupied table).  

Not on my list of favorites, but certainly not bad and worth trying.  I think I&#39;ll go back and try a few of their margaritas one night."

The service was the worst service I have experienced. The waiter seemed disinterested and inattentive. When we arrived to take our order, I mentioned to him I checked in and I wanted to use the check in offer. 

Without looking at the offer, I was told it could not be used. When I inquired about the reason, I was told he would have to speak with the manager. I asked if he could check before we ordered. He left for several minutes and went to the kitchen (the manager who I know was at the bar). He returned and said he needed to my phone to show the manager. 

Fast forward. Manager says of course. Food comes. No extra napkins, additional salsa or return to see if everything was good. When he did return it was near the end of the meal. I had the impression he was upset that a coupon was used, but his demeanor was pretty sour at the outset. 

I am doubtful that I will allow this bad experience keep me from ever returning, but I am sure it will be a while before I go back or suggest any one else does. There are good Mexican joints on every corner. I will happily redeem coupons and spend money someplace else in the immediate future."

When I checked in on Yelp, I found a $7.99 coupon good off two full meals, great deal!

There is an outdoor patio which I did enjoy last summer and I am looking forward to enjoying it again this year.

Upon walking in, greeted by a friendly young man who promptly sat us at a cute booth. He immediately took our drink order, a big ass strawberry margarita (STRONG) and a mango daiquiri. both arrived quickly and were good. 

While we were waiting for the drinks, a basket of fresh chips and salsa was delivered. Also, good. 

Time to order. I had the combination fajitas and my husband had the mucho something burrito. He liked his. Mine  came to the table sizzling hot and wasn&#39;t bad. The vegetables were cooked well, but it was something about the meat that I didn&#39;t care for. I don&#39;t know if they boil it or make it ahead of time then just heat it up when ordered because the food came FAST.  

Dessert. The fried ice cream. GOOD. ask for no whip cream.. I&#39;ve always had fried ice cream with sopapillas on the side so we had an order of those too. They were both good at $3.99 a piece... my kind of prices... 

The place is well decorated with great colors and art on the backs of the chairs, tables, and even walls. They also had a nice seating area outside which seems great for summer nights. 

Overall, not bad. I&#39;ve had better, but for something quick and reasonably priced, I&#39;d go again. 

Service: The same guy who seated us served us and there were a few other guys walking around making sure everyone had what they needed. They were attentive but didn&#39;t rush.

Our server wasn&#39;t very friendly and didn&#39;t seem like he was having a good day. Since we were hungry, we went through the chips really quickly.  We asked for another basket and waited, and waited.  Until I decided to ask another server who was much more attentive.

I went in for dinner last week with a girlfriend around 7:00pm.  If you know anything about Elk Grove Village, you know that it is an industrial/business town.  They basically roll up the roads after the 5:00pm whistle blows.  It was pretty quiet when we walked in, so I figured that they would be glad to have customers.  

My girlfriend had a Restaurant.com certificate and she wanted to try it.  I like to use these certificates when we are first trying a new place.  If I like it, obviously I will be back paying full price over and over again.  Especially when I work five minutes away.  I think that some restaurants don&#39;t realize this fact.    

We were seated in a brightly painted room.  The look of the room made me feel upbeat.  It was the sort of place that I could see my youngest nieces really enjoying because it looks so fun!

Someone came along and dropped off chips and salsa.  Mexican Restaurants, please pay attention!  Salty chips and spicy salsa should not be dropped at a table without ice water following very shortly thereafter.  Sadly, this cardinal rule was missed.  We waited.  And waited.  And waited.

Finally, a waitress came over and offered to get drinks.  I ordered an iced tea.  My girlfriend ordered a Diet Coke and water.  More waiting.  When it finally arrived, there was no water.  Tea and Diet Coke only.  We asked for the water again.  By now, I have tasted the iced tea which tastes like water with a lemon in it.  The waitress returns.  I request a Coke instead.  

The Coke does not arrive.  She returns to take our order.  I ask about the Coke.  She says that she will get it.

Nothing.

I ask a passing waiter for a Coke.  He miraculously appears just moments later with a Coke in hand.  Ahhh.  Much better.

When the food arrives, it comes from someone other than the waitress which makes me wonder what in the world she has been doing all night.  She doesn&#39;t deliver drinks, she doesn&#39;t deliver food, she doesn&#39;t clear dishes.  I think she only takes orders and brings them to the kitchen.  We may as well have ordered at a counter for the lack of service that we received.  

The food.  The complimentary soup was very good.  It was a chicken chipotle soup.  Kinda creamy.  Not something that I would normally think to try, but the pieces of chicken breast were a nice surprise and I would consider trying that again.  My girlfriend&#39;s chimichanga received high praise from her.  She liked the flavor and said that it was fresh.  My chicken and mole enchiladas were okay.  The mole was quite strong.  The chicken was not dry, but the combo wasn&#39;t exactly what I was hoping for.  The Mexican rice was dry and clumpy.  I only took a bite or two and the flavor really wasn&#39;t there.

I don&#39;t plan on returning anytime soon which is a shame.  I would like somewhere to head to right after work for a good dinner.  This just isn&#39;t it."

Our last visit ok a weekday night we sat for 10 minutes before we were ever acknowledged. Turns out there was only one waiter, who was also working the bar.  Even though they were slow, he couldn&#39;t seem to keep up. Hence we were ignored. My boyfriend order carne asada, and I&#39;d never seen a smaller portion of steak. When they set it down in front of him it was very sad looking.  See photo. I ordered the chimichanga. I came covered in Queso (I hate Queso) which the menu did not say.

My friend and I went here last night for a girls&#39; night, and I am sure glad we did!!  We started with the cheese dip and the nachos supreme.  Both portions were very generous and delicious!  Especially the nachos--you can&#39;t go wrong with nachos that come with both pulled chicken AND beef.  YUM!

We also ordered meals (which we found out after our nachos that we did NOT need to do since we were that full from the appetizers!  But it came with chicken chipotle soup, which in theory sounds good, but in reality, was not very good.  My friend ordered fajitas and was sweet enough to share a bite with me--yum!!  I got the taco salad, and there were SO many delicious ingredients in it, and it was in the flakiest, most delicious taco bowl I have ever eaten.  I would eat it every day if I could!

The only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star rating would be the service.  Our waiter took forever to take our order on anything, and we found out later it&#39;s because he was spending more time sitting at the bar watching the Bulls game than anything.

I went with a quesadilla fajita. I&#39;ve had something similar before. They stick the meat between two shells with the cheese and cut them into triangles. Unbeknownst to me, on this one they also put cheese on the outside. I couldn&#39;t pick it up, because it was in one large, folded large shell. Like a too-big-to-hold taco. What I&#39;ve had before was in a fried tortilla shell. But you can&#39;t do that with cheese on top of them. The steak was inconsistent and the chicken just okay. It was nothing like a quesadilla, nor a fajita, both of which I love. Mine was bad, but my friends was worse. She had steak enchiladas. The red sauce they put on top was oddly flavored. She ate three bites. When asked, the manager said it was standard enchilada sauce. The manager offered to take the meal off the bill, which we agreed to."

The craftsmanship on the chairs is pretty amazing for this style of restaurant.

We were served with a small chicken chipotle soup which was a bit spicy and a bit greasy as you could see it through the broth. I ordered a shrimp, scallop and meat fajitas meal. Nothing was burned, but it did lack flavor... i kept looking for the salsa to bring something into the mix.  I also ordered a Guacamole which sadly never made its way to my table. The waiter completely forgot about my order. I was trying to feel happy about the fajitas platter I was given but the side of guac would of helped me feel happier. 

I found myself waiting on the waiter a few times for more refreshments and tortillas..... he did say its tortillas all you want and well.... I wanted more but it took way to long to come out.

We ordered the lemonade which was really good but didn&#39;t make up for the lack in taste in our food.

I cant say I would come back, although the waiter did say that If we came back they would give a guacamole on the house which i found that to be nice. 

For a lunch time hour it was not to full.... the buffet next door seems to be taking the glory thats for sure. Id go there.."

I was really looking forward to eating here. It&#39;s where the old La Magdalena used to be. I was really disappointed all the way around. 

First, it was crowded when we went last night so I figured that there must have been a reason...not to mention that it&#39;s the opening week so the food should be good. Well, it wasn&#39;t the case. 

We were seated at the only booth they had left, in the corner of the bar...no biggie. It took some time for a server to come around with chips and salsa. The salsa was spicy, which I like but my husband doesn&#39;t, but we didn&#39;t have water. I had to go to the bar to place a drink order b/c we had been sitting there for over 10 minutes without being greeted by a server. 

The menu wasn&#39;t what I was expecting either. I thought that given the name there would be grilled items offered. Nope, it&#39;s just your run of the mill Mexican restaurant, serving Americanized Mexican food. 

We placed our order and I expected the service to pick up a little bit since the manager comped our first round of drinks for being slow. That didn&#39;t happen, once again we were the forgotten table. I thought it was b/c they seemed to be busy and they&#39;re new, but the &#34;chef&#34; came out to greet two guys at the bar and while they were chatting I overheard that most of the servers were from the old restaurant that used to be there. Great, so they&#39;re not new just incredibly slow! 

So, despite my irritation at being the forgotten ones I was looking forward to our food, expecting it to be their saving grace. Nope, again! They really need to lay off the salt! There was so much salt in the beans that I actually puckered. We also ordered guacamole, I was expecting fresh guac but it seemed to be packaged...and it had NO flavor other than salt! 

My husband didn&#39;t really care for it either, and he&#39;s not a picky eater. We will not be returning. 

One good thing about the place that I did like was the decor. They have what appear to be hand painted chairs and booths that are really pretty. However, that&#39;s not enough for us to return."

It&#39;s down the street from me, very large, has a nice outdoor area for the summer.  Once I walked inside and saw the bright fun decor I was even more excited for this to be our new local taco place.  Sadly that won&#39;t be the case.  To keep the playing field even at all the taco places I go to, I always get steak tacos so as to compare apples to apples, err steak to steak.  Just like a taco place down the road from here, the meat was bland and had no flavor to it.  Very americanized.  I review mentioned how great the salsa was and that being my favorite food I was excited to try it.  It had no real flavor or kick to it at all.  Just cold bland tomato dip essentially.  The saving grace here was the queso.  My friend got it and, if im remembering correctly (we visited here a while ago now) that dip was the best part of our meals.  Maybe I&#39;d come back here to try the margaritas and get a non-salsa dip and chips while catching up, but wouldn&#39;t plan a whole meal here.  This place fits a running pattern I&#39;ve seen that bigger is not better when it comes to taco locations."

Third waiter didn&#39;t have our gift certificate and couldn&#39;t find it when he gave us the bill. Situation was amicably resolved, but odd that it wasn&#39;t communicated of the server change.

I thought the salsa was good. Guacamole was bland, but our meals were good (enchiladas). Margaritas were good, as the fried ice cream. Rated experience 2 stars due to the slow service.

First, this is a non-margarita review (i didn&#39;t get tipsy before I ate, so it  pretty much is a non filtered review. 

The nacho chips they brought out , while fresh and nicely chewable, had a very mild taste of an un-natural product...kind of like a very very mild taste of plastic--maybe the oil they used??? Or maybe a cheap plastic bag they were stored in or how they were purchased.

I didn&#39;t take the complimentary Chicken Coodle Soup because I was really looking forward to my Hot and Spicey Buritto--but I did take a couple of sips of what my wife had left in her bowl...once again, a very very mild aftertaste of someting odd; didn&#39;t enjoy the taste at all.

The Hot and Spicey Burrito was a pretty big dissappointment. The size was ample, but the Chicken and Beef on the inside was bland and appeared to be unseasoned.

If you like Burritos, you can&#39;t go wrong with El Sombrero on Elmhurst Road in Mount Prospect or La Hacienda on Lake Street in Roselle. 

Overall: Toluca&#39;s in McHenry is the king in my eyes:

Stopped by while on break during a volunteer stint. Have wanted to try the place for awhile, especially since there&#39;s one not far from where I live too. Ended up ordering 3/4 lb of shrimp and their hush puppies. 

Both were good and overall fairly reasonable price-wise. The shrimp was fairly crispy, maybe a little more than I would have liked even though I kept the bag closed to keep the steam in on the way back to base. Good cocktail sauce to accompany. Wish that there was a 1/2 order of hush puppies available - even though they&#39;re pretty cheap ($2.00 for 10 of them), ten is a lot for one person to eat.

franks-chicago-shrimp-hoffman-estates,Satyam C.,1sKNE1YABjc7aViN0hJI4Q,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,1,0,4,4,4FhLXZbRSFYpkqqGxVeh7A,4.0,2016-06-25,"Always have had a bit of anxiety about going here for some some reason, but after a 2 years I just said screw it and I dove in. It was too hot to cook and I was hungry for something I haven&#39;t ordered yet from around the neighborhood. Yelp suggested. I took it up on its on offer. 

First off let me break down pounds to pieces of food. Approximately. 

1/2 pound Chicago shrimp = 8 shrimp. 1 person needs 8 if nothing else is ordered. Otherwise get get only a 1/4 pound. 

1/4 pound of catfish = 4 good sized strips. Maybe about a filets worth. 

Clam strips and mushrooms are a set price which I will cover in a moment. I will update you about other items as in frequent the location more. 

Being as it was my first time here, I was a little hesitant and worry about the previous reviewer&#39;s stating the employees are rude. Fortunately this was not the case at all. A young teenage girl helped me order what she thought was a good amount of food. Of course it was a bit more than I could eat but that&#39;s OK. He was very pleasant as was the lady in the back who is cooking the food. She suggested I get the shrimp, the half pound portion. I guess she did not realize I was going to order more.

After I took one bite of the shrimp and the juices oozed out. This was damn good. Other reviewers complained that it lacks seasoning. To them I say sprinkle some lemon juice on there or some salt if you want. I do understand your concerns but it&#39;s a matter of taste. The shrimp itself tasted fresh. Real fresh. The salt flavor came from the ocean it one lived in. The shrimp are also huge. 

The same goes for the catfish. It tastes exactly like how fish is supposed to taste with no smell in just a clean crisp taste in your mouth. It looks as if this batter is the same as the shrimp. Once again it is huge. 

The clam strips barely made it home as I munched on them while driving. The clam in the mushrooms do not seem to be prepared in the store. The batter it&#39;s self looks completely different than of the fish and shrimp. I don&#39;t know why people are knocking the mushrooms. They are typical mushrooms that you get from any restaurant but they only cost three dollars.

Tips: stick with the quarter pound of portions if you are going to sample. Get the dinner which includes fries and a salad if you know what you want. You get a half pound of food with that so it is a very good deal. 

And of course, keep the bag open if you take it to go and want it crispy. 

I hate myself for not going here years sooner."

I have had fabulous fried shrimp by the bag in Chicago and this paled in comparison. I like lemon squeezed on my shrimp especially when sitting in a restaurant eating and not carry out.

To me the oil seemed like it needed to be changed and quite honestly the indigestion I had afterwards will keep me from returning.

I tried the catfish, scallops and shrimp (Chicago style) the catfish was fried perfectly and tasty, however it didn&#39;t taste much like catfish, just kinda bland in the seasoning dept I guess. The shrimp are very juicy and good quality, the cocktail sauce is a big plus as well, perfectly spicy and tangy 

The scallops I could&#39;ve gone without, they were good but I prefer scallops steamed and with Cajun seasoning or lemon pepper. 

Overall I liked it, but for some reason don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be coming back, maybe it&#39;s just not my cup of tea, I&#39;m sure plenty of people would be thrilled, I guess I was hoping for catfish like I get from places out west and south side, this is not that but it&#39;s very good.

Breaded mushrooms were definitely a generic brand such as &#34;Qualité&#34; brand from the local food service wholesale stores. 

Staff was definitely friendly and well informed. They even gave instructions to not close the bag for at least five minutes to avoid making shrimp soggy. That put a smile on my face because I have a food service background and that showed me that they really cared. 

Also, get with the times and put in a soda fountain! Only canned beverages? I&#39;m sure you know that your margin is much greater on a fountain drink than a bottled drink and also better value for your dine in customers!

The Ocean Perch was terrible, the fish must have been old or spoiled, same situation with the catfish. 3 stars just because the fried shrimp was ok, the macaroni salad was great, and the service was fantastic. Too bad the recipe can&#39;t be dollied up a little more. And maybe some more selection and fresher fish. Prices are ok.."

Absolutely fresh shrimp and fish in a no frills setting. Lots of variety of shrimp size and different breading. To bad they don&#39;t have a restaurant. They would do much more business if they were a bit south of their current location. Really well worth the stop. The original Frank&#39;s has been in Chicago on Irving Park for many many years. Just a small old timey fish shop with lots of fresh fish to purchase to make yourself, but they will prepare certain items. I&#39;m thrilled they open a shop on Barrington Rd in Hoffman Estates."

franks-chicago-shrimp-hoffman-estates,Peter T.,VP5wjC-QIeKvUv6_E-laBA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,91,12,Oa0JjrY54FKcusQgE1_RRQ,5.0,2014-10-08,"(NOTE:  online maps are wrong.  restaurant is NORTH of I-90, in a small strip mall on the east side of Barrington road.) 

When you think of &#34;Chicago food,&#34;  most likely deep dish pizza and hot dogs come to mind;  but a &#39;native dish&#39; in Chicago is fried shrimp, and you&#39;ll find local chains competing for the best recipes and reviews.  The oldest, and arguably the best, is Frank&#39;s Chicago Shrimp House, with four locations.

I lived in Chicago twice and didn&#39;t know this, and having lived in New Orleans for some time, I&#39;ve become kind of a shrimp snob.  There are thousands of shrimp species,  varying in size and color, dependent upon their habitat.  In recent years, methods of farming shrimp have become more developed, and a great deal of the shrimp you purchase in the grocery or at a restaurant was farm raised (not caught in the wild).  Shrimp are sorted by the number per pound, with 10 U (under 10) the largest available in the US.  11-15 would be considered &#34;jumbo&#34; by most any classification system.

I&#39;ve been lucky to have even bigger, in the hospitable warm and food rich waters of Southeast Asia..   I&#39;ve also had the pleasure of purchasing shrimp right off the boats in both New Orleans and along the Texas Gulf Coast.  Shrimp boats ply most of the Gulf Coast and you can regularly get the freshest shrimp available anywhere at a bargain price.....bring your cooler.  In addition to fresh Gulf shrimp, my very favorite is Key West shrimp, known by their bright pink color and sweet meat.

All that to say, you won&#39;t find any pond raised shrimp at Frank&#39;s.  Born in 1946 as the Ship Shape Shrimp Shake the business flourished for thirty years until ill health caused the owner to shut it down.   A few years later, a local businessman got together with the former owner with a plan to reopen. Frank&#39;s opened with the old recipes, and the founder&#39;s philosophy of selling the freshest seafood as inexpensively as possible, and was an immediate success.  These day&#39;s, Frank&#39;s daughters run the four current locations while developing more expansion plans.

The menu is brief.  Buy by the plate,  pound, or partial pound.  Fried shrimp (regular), Chicago style (spiced fried), Catfish, Scallops, Perch, Chicken Strips and Frog Legs.  Sides include fries, rings, zucchini, slaw, and a few other items.   The top price on the menu is $20 / pound for the shrimp, a fairly reasonable price.  Eat in or take out.

I opted for some Chicago style shrimp and some cat, with a few fries on the side.  Everything was fried perfectly and the &#39;seasoned&#39; pieces had a slight hint of heat.  Shrimp are good sized with just the right firmness, and cooked when you order.   A choice of condiments is offered:  seafood sauce, bbq, tartar, lemon juice, and  one other I forgot already.

This is great stuff."

When My stomach rang the alarm, i was simply going to Drop into Jimmy Johns for a Freaky Fast sammitch (ha ya do&#39;in?). 
Driving into the strip mall where it&#39;s at Franks Chicago Shrimp caught my eye. I could barely catch a view of the menu board above the counter. It didn&#39;t look all That interesting and I wasn&#39;t sure if they had Fish sandwich&#39;s. I continued to drive toward JJ&#39;s and something drew me backaround toward the front of Franks. 
I thought to myself, &#34;it&#39;s Friday and instead Of loading up on carbs, it would be Good to eat healthy today.&#34; Good choice! I stepped in and it&#39;s far from glitzy but good, clean and functional. It reminds me of places I&#39;ve eaten at along Lake Michigan, or on the near South side when folks fished the lake or the South Branch in the morning and served their catch to workmen for lunch and dinner. A true home style Chicago restaurant. I ordered ¾ lb. of catfish and was told that they come in strips. Also ordered the potato cakes and macaroni salad. The total was $12.52, a little on the steep side, but if the meal is good, so what? I sat while they prepared My lunch and the three ladies behind the counter were done in about 5 min. Then sent me away with a buh-bye sweetie goodbye. Nice! 
 Jumped into my truck to head back to the office and as I drove away I checked the bag...... HEY! Where is my macaroni salad!??? Ilooked closely and counted the smaller bags and ramakins. It was there in a 4 oz. ramakin. A first look I thought this was a joke it was soooo cute and tiiiiny! And I&#39;m big and HUNGRY! I returned to the restaurant and when I walked through the door, the ladies were caring for another customer and looked surprised at the ramakin in my hand. The lady that packaged my meal earlier asked if everything was all right. &#34;This is all you get for a $1.25? Is this the bite-size portion?&#34;I asked. Hang on she suggested and turned away for a second and retrieved another container. I had my wallet out and she looked at me and said, &#34;don&#39;t worry about it, enjoy sweetie.&#34; Again the three left me feeling good until I sat at my desk with my lunch. 
 I opened the bag, arranged the meal. I opened the sealed ramakins and whiffed the container of Macaroni salad. Then inhaled the aroma of the catfish. YUUMMM! 
 The catfish was really lighly breaded, what is barely a seasoned breadcrumb mix and not a heavy batter. Just a little crunchy and the way they prepare it, it&#39;s not oily from a deep frier and the fish remaining flakey and moist. The cocktail sause is home made in the restaurant And has a great sweet tangy radish flavor to it. The Macaroni salad was sweet and the sauce was not a heavy creamy mess. It too hand a slight zest to it, enough so that I scraped the ramakin empty with my finger as a squegee. Also, i probably could have gotten away with just one ramakin of salad because it was so filling. But it was soooo good I&#39;m glad I was gifted a second. Overall from the outside looking in, there isn&#39;t much to draw you to this place because I&#39;ve driven by a half dozen times and found nothing persuasive to make me go in. This isn&#39;t Red Lobster ot Joe&#39;s Crabtree Shack.... It&#39;s ten thousand times better! I would enciurage them to try and market to the younger crowd to get them to try Franks Shrimp and Fish because I&#39;m certain these kids drive by and don&#39;t appreciate what they&#39;re missing. After today, that opinion is now changed for me and this place will become a regular stop. Next time I&#39;ll try the Shrimp or shallops they serve and share that experience too. Mangia!"

It was nice because we had a whole $20 to make it rain, so we were able to take advantage of the menu and try anything we wanted to. Also, since it&#39;s all fried, it didn&#39;t take long (we carried out) so we were pleased that we got a variety and it didn&#39;t take forever.

The menu is unique to me, because you can order anything you want in any quantity you need. [For example you could get 1/2 lb of Chicago Shrimp, a 1/4 lb of Frog Legs, a 1/4 lb of Catfish Strips.] I&#39;m sure there are countless places like this, but Frank&#39;s was my first experience, so at first it was hard to get through what we wanted, but it all worked out as we stumbled through the order. The dude was understanding.

Like I mentioned, we went with the variety to get a sampling. We liked everything we got, but next time we&#39;ll target what we really enjoyed. I would go back specifically for the Catfish, and Seasoned Shrimp. Again, it&#39;s all fried, so I would order a little bit as a component to the meal versus it being the entire meal....it can be overwhelming. 

The Hush Puppies were awesome. This was my first encounter with them (and the Frog Legs) and I think my life is a little fuller. 

Another honorable mention would be the cocktail sauce. They have 3 to choose from ranging in spiciness and you really can&#39;t lose.

I&#39;d go back when I get a craving for fried food (or when I&#39;m completely hungover) but the bottom line is that I would definitely be back. My only wish is this that they would have a sandwich or something, but 4 out of 5 ain&#39;t bad."

It takes some bogus crap to happen in order to land yourself in that category...so here goes:

My mom and I bought a groupon to try this place out. So excited to have a fried fish joint close to my house.

That&#39;s where the glee ends, unfortunately, because Frank&#39;s was...the worst and I wish I could give it negative stars. 

We ordered the chicago shrimp, catfish, and hush puppies and after a mixup at the register on prices and amounts, we finally left with our food.

On the way home I was so excited to get my mouth on the catfish, so my mom handed me a piece to try. I PULLED THE CAR OVER, OPENED MY DOOR, AND SPIT IT OUT. It tasted like it was SPOILED!!! It had this weird color and don&#39;t get me started on the smell...which should&#39;ve tipped me off before I put it in my mouth and chewed it.

I have never experienced anything like that in my life. 

The shrimp weren&#39;t spoiled, but they weren&#39;t tasty either. The breading nor the shrimp itself seemed like they were seasoned at all. Just bland seafood.

It was too too congested on Barrington Road to want to turn around and drive all the way back to shove this food back in their faces, so whatever.

I can&#39;t give this place my business anymore and although I&#39;d like folks to form their own opinions based on their own experiences, helping people not waste their time or money is what reviewing is all about and I take it seriously - I&#39;d caution anyone from trying this place. 

No, seriously...don&#39;t."

Thank you, Groupon, for reminding me about this place &amp; to give them a try.  I don&#39;t know what they put in the breading for their fried items, but I&#39;m guessing it is the crystal-meth of the fried-breading world.  It was so flavorful &amp; came out perfectly crunchy a physical barrier between me &amp; my fried-goodness had to be created to keep me from scarfing it all down.

We tried the catfish, shrimp (Chicago-style), veggie combo basket (cauliflower, shrooms, onion rings &amp; zucchini) &amp; the hushpuppies - all were fan-freakin&#39;-tastic.  I think there was even a little bit of cheese in the fried cauliflower; yum.  I did think some of the strips of catfish were on the small side but I know everything is weighed &amp; I got the 1/2 lb. I ordered...I would have just liked it to be bigger pieces to make up the 1/2 lb.  Next time I&#39;ll get the Hubs to try the frog legs.  I like frog legs but he&#39;s never been brave enough to try them.  Another family sitting next to us did get the frog legs to try &amp; they seemed far bigger &amp; meatier than any frog legs I&#39;ve had in the past.

The place is tiny, maybe 8-10 small tables &amp; they do a brisk take-out business.  The food comes out piping hot from the fryer so if you live in the area everything should still be nice &amp; hot by the time you get it home."

And while it may not be the best, I don&#39;t always need the best.  I&#39;m not a snob about most things.  They&#39;re perfectly fine for most people, or they even be awesome to some others.  But they&#39;re okay and the price is right.  I&#39;ve been here a couple times and the food always takes just a couple of minuted to get, since it&#39;s fried fresh.  On my most recent visit I came here on the way home around 950pm.  

I got inside and received a blank stare from the employee who told me &#34;We&#39;re closed&#34;

Prepare to receive my ire, with all the things I see wrong with this certain statement and situation.

First of all, if you wanted to close early, turn the fucking lights off and lock the door, that way, I don&#39;t even get out of my car when I pull into the lot. I&#39;ll see the building &#34;looks&#34; closed even though I know there&#39;s 10 minutes left on your clock.  So thanks for wasting my fucking time.  

Second, why even attempt to close with 10 minutes left?  Like 10 minutes is such a long ass time to get an early start on your night?  If your business hours state that you&#39;re open at this time and close at this time, I expect to receive service until your listed close time.  Which was 10 minutes after I walked in the door.  I seriously hate that.

Third, why should anyone even list a closing time if you&#39;re not going to stick to it?  May as well just open whenever you want too.  While you&#39;re at it, take a 3 hour lunch!  Don&#39;t forget your midday siesta and your afternoon nap! Lazy.

I&#39;ll come back here, unfortunately. But if I receive the same crap excuse if I come in at 945, it&#39;s not going to be good."

Very casual and small (about eight tables). Nothing fancy, but the place is clean. Service is great, and the food is EXCELLENT. The Chicago-Style shrimp is my favorite. Catfish is my OTHER favorite. The hush puppies are awesome, too. I like that they give you free sauces with the shrimp or fish (others places sometimes charge extra).

Been several times over the last year-and-a-half.  I&#39;ve found the place usually devoid of other customers whenever I&#39;ve been there, usually around 1-2 pm.  Generally, the food has been what I expected, with the exception of not being able to distinguish between the &#34;chicago style&#34; and the &#34;regular&#34; fried wild-caught gulf shrimp.  Its been tasty but I honestly don&#39;t find any seasoning difference...and the last time I went I ordered both so I could compare them side-by-side, and watched them prepare it.  There was no difference, and I didn&#39;t see the gal do anything different to the shrimp before battering the chicago-style.  I thought it might just &#34;be me&#34; but my two fellow &#34;late lunching dinners&#34; couldn&#39;t tell the difference either.

The hush puppies are very tasty, however on to occasions were slightly underdone (doughy in the middle).

Unlike other reviewers, I find the french fries to be just fine, 

The place is clean, and shares a generous parking lot  with other businesses, I have had to walk a bit when the full-service restaurant next door is quite busy.

Note: as other reviewers have commented, the map feature is wrong, the business is a good mile plus north of the I-90 overpass on Barrington Road on the east side, it is the second buiness from the north end of the shopping plaza/strip mall, kind of tucked in there, and easy to miss.  A means to left turn out (to return south) is rather difficult and convoluted, but a northbound continuation on Barrington Road is easily accomplished."

I visit Willow Creek Church and sometimes go for lunch in the area. I noticed Frank&#39;s Chicago Shrimp House in a mini strip mall and thought, &#39;okay let&#39;s give it a try&#39;. There is overall curb eye appeal, however, once inside it reminded me of a basic shrimp house come to the northwestern burbs. I did expect a bit more, although, since I&#39;m not from the area, I guess I got what I was used to seeing. Everything is clean; there is a sitting area, the counter was tidy. The cooks/counter ladies were also very nice...However the food...

It&#39;s not Troha&#39;s. It was a bit heavy on the seasonings and the batter was more like a breading. If you haven&#39;t had Troha&#39;s in Chicago&#39;s Little Village, you might say, &#34;Hmmm, this is pretty good shrimp&#34;, but since I have; it doesn&#39;t compare. 

I will return, simply to give it a far shake and try something else, but since this is what the burbs have to offer; I guess this is as good as it gets, for those who don&#39;t venture into Chicago, (let alone the Little Village).

From the simple menu to the traditional sides, this place really hit the spot for my authentic down and dirty city fried seafood cravings.

I wanted to try a little bit of everything so we ordered a little bit of each of the following: Chicago shrimp, scallops, catfish strips, clam strips, perch, fries, and coleslaw.  I can&#39;t say there wasn&#39;t anything I didn&#39;t like about the entire line up except that I overate and suffered from heartburn as a result.  It was worth it though and I&#39;d do it again.

None of our items were overcooked so everything was tender and just the right amount of chewy or flaky.  All items were made to order so absolutely nothing came out from under a heat lamp. I think the only time they may even use a heat lamp is to keep a partial order warm while the rest of the order is completed.

The lady who took our order was very friendly and suggested different sauces that complimented each item we ordered.  She made sure we had enough hot sauce and other various condiments as well.

1. &#34;We don&#39;t have any more rice&#34;. 
2. &#34;No more miso soup&#34;. 

What??

Let&#39;s keep in mind that this place is located in a strip mall along with a brand-new Tony&#39;s supermarket. If you&#39;re really are out of rice, go get some next door and make it. It takes 15 minutes to do so from start to finish.


Mind you, this is a 7:30PM reservation for 6 on a Saturday night.  It&#39;s not as if we showed up as the place was closing. 

Food- Subpar at best.  Like many sushi fusion  restaurants, this place is owned and run exclusively by Korean personnel. Usually a good thing, as they are typically some of the best restauranteurs in this biz.  That being said, when you order a bulgogi (Korean staple) appetizer and it&#39;s not been marinated like all bulgogi is and must be, you start to get concerned about the rest of the meal.  Instead, it came out dry and was merely drizzled with some ponzu sauce that they had leftover. 

Onto the rolls.  Usually the spicy mayo/sauce  on top of your sushi is mixed with Sriracha or some other spice. Theirs came out pure white and had the flavor of a generic Miracle Whip. 

Chicken Teriyaki dish for in-laws: Way over cooked. 

I felt bad for the poor waiter. He was profusely apologizing for the food (or lack thereof) all while the senior hostess (surely the owner) was barking orders and interrupting him while he was trying to take ours.

I give this place six months before the doors are shut.  Even the water fountains and other Asian-infused decor in the front of the house were shut down and literally roped off with a paper sign."

Why drive endless hours in traffic to dine in Chicago and later be disappointed by its pretentious ambiance? With it&#39;s abundance of parking and lack of city traffic, this local gem is easy to get to. The façade is modest with white curtains hanging from the inside, which might fool a first timer to think it&#39;s a hole-in-the-wall. As the saying goes, you cannot judge a book by its cover. When you first open the door, it&#39;s like opening the gates to a Japanese heaven, where you are greeted by a Japanese goddess. And her name is Naomi.

I&#39;ve visited many sushi restaurants around the city for a number of years now. Some were hits, others were misses. Naomi is ranked top 3 sushi restaurants that I&#39;ve been to. This is surprising since you only hear about good sushi in Chicago and never the burbs. After my visit, Naomi quickly became one of the best sushi experiences I&#39;ve had in a long time. From the miso soup to the main course, everything was delectable.  The fish used on the sushi was as fresh as it comes. You can easily notice the experience that these sushi chefs have obtain over the years by the quality of each sushi that comes to your table. 

Overall, Naomi is an exceptional restaurant that caters to even the pickiest eaters. If they moved the entire restaurant and placed it on Michigan Avenue, it could easily be one of the best sushi establishments in Chicago. Since I&#39;m only minutes away from its current location, I wouldn&#39;t allow it. The service is friendly and attentive."

I loved Naomi sushi and truly looked forward to coming here, this is one of the first places I went to for sushi and even though I now live closer to other places I prefer I still come around...

So when I saw the groupon I got it! 

Wish that would&#39;ve been a good idea but it wasn&#39;t. I got a reality check today while having dinner here. 

The sushi USED to be top of the line. Now it&#39;s subpar even for the discounted price.

We ordered the rainbow and the fish was fishier and kind of off-tasting, there was no avocado this time, just crab salad. Wasn&#39;t the tastiest 

We then got the zebra, this one was pretty good, probably the best roll we had but still not as mouth-watering as I remember 

We ordered shrimp tempura and spicy tuna rolls that were just not as good as I expected (reminded me of sushi you pick up at a good grocery store, good but not good enough)

To top it off our waiter was slow and forgetful (horrible combo for a waiter) but he always said sorry for forgetting us haha if that makes it any better


He also didn&#39;t know how the groupon  worked so I somehow didn&#39;t get my $40 for $25 I ended up just getting a $35 credit and he said there was nothing he could do! That was the last straw! Oh well I&#39;m not coming here anymore there&#39;s a sushi place down the street (5th avenue) that I hear is better so I&#39;ll give them a shot."

The big one is they have a small staff, resulting in employees taking on multiple duties and dragging out wait time. In our experience the wait wasn&#39;t as much an issue after they have your order, the rolls keep coming at a steady pace. The apps, sushi, rolls, are all good and of quality but the cocktails could be better. I tend to order some sake and a saki bomb. It&#39;s been a while since stopping by on a Fri or Sat night so I don&#39;t know how busy it gets, but the sofa probably acts more as decor than purpose. It would make sense in a lounge setting and there was a lot of business, but with a lacking cocktail selection I don&#39;t see it being utilized.

They used to have a website with a menu, but I can&#39;t seem to find it which is a bad sign. Did they figure it was an expense worth cutting? I hope not because it doesn&#39;t encourage take out or potential customers if people can&#39;t see when they are open or what they serve. 

Please Naomi&#39;s, don&#39;t kill off your own business. This is my &#39;go to&#39; sushi place and would hate to see it go. I miss seeing who I assumed was the owner, a friendly and outgoing woman who recognized you and made you feel welcome and appreciated."

Waitress was not kind when we asked for separate checks. The octopus nigiri was legitimately frozen when I bit into it. Very overpriced for extremely mediocre sushi... The  crunchy tuna rolls are extremely small so even though its daily special you might as well get specialty roll with more pieces. Drinks are overpriced. Last time I come here.

We&#39;ve driven past Naomi Sushi a number of times since my sister moved into the area, but only just now got around to trying it.  It&#39;s absolutely wonderful!  We&#39;d made a reservation, so I was greeted by name at the door.  And they called me by name all through the dinner.  

The decor is very nice - lots of draped fabric, nice cushions with supportive backs for the platform seating, and other nice touches that do wonders to keep down the noise.  The food was great, and the service was amazingly gracious.  

What I found most interesting is that the basics even had great attention to detail.  As at most sushi places, with the Maki, we got miso soup and a salad. Often times at those places, these two are after-thoughts. Not at Naomi.  The miso soup had great flavor, and the salad was fresh with a tastier-than-usual dressing.  And the avocado roll (the avocado roll, for Pete&#39;s sake) was both beautiful and very tasty.  

If you&#39;re in the neighborhood of Rand and Palatine, or even if you&#39;re not, this is a wonderful gem!"

While the sushi quality is still good, everything else has sadly gone downhill over an accelerated pace. My spouse and have been semi-regulars over the past few years, and our experience just last week had us both shaking our heads. Walking in the place, it is just a complete mess of decor. They have an above-ground stone fish pond, so it&#39;s impossible to see when seated but you certainly hear it. There are boxes of supplies everywhere, including cleaning supplies, near actual serving tables. Some of the cheap stone sculptures even have cobwebs on them. The lighting inside is very poor and even depressing.

It seems that the only person the owner can afford to have work there is a younger relative, I&#39;m guessing either her son or a nephew. He tries to be polite but he clearly has no serving experience and doesn&#39;t seem to really want to be there. Not once during our entire meal did he offer to check on us and see if we needed anything. 

Unfortunately it seems like there&#39;s too much of a culture gap for the owner consider any consumer feedback over why her regulars are leaving, and the places always seems to be very sparse with patrons. We&#39;re thinking they may not make it another 4 months. It&#39;s a shame because they really could be making some changes that wouldn&#39;t cost them much that could bring people back in.

UPDATE: THEY HAVE NO ONLINE MENU! When I called to ask where I could find a menu, they told me to drive to their place and wait at least 20 minutes, depending on how busy they were. What&#39;s the point of doing take out if they can&#39;t even have a take out menu available online???? Geez."

The service was not bad, could have have been better but I can live with it. 
The sushi was great, I ordered the dragon and bear roll, my friend had the veggie roll and edemames. My rolls were supposed to come with Miso soup which i never got but there was too much food anyway, I am not sure I needed it.

I&#39;m by no means a sushi nut or expert, but I&#39;ve had my fair share.  We will get the craving once every other month and Naomi was our choice mainly because of the yelp and google reviews.  

Generally I&#39;m a spicy tuna kinda guy and not a big adventurer when it comes to sushi although I did eat outside my comfort zone a little @ Naomi.

Its right in front of Ultra Foods in a little strip mall next to a dentist office and it was sooo good. They have unique sushi choices. I would recommend reservations since they do not open until 5pm. We had to wait a little while for our sushi to come out so they ended up giving us a free dessert. It was totally unnecessary but we appreciated it.

It comes with soup, salad, the entree, rice, 3 pieces of nigiri, cucumber and crab salad, various tempura (shrimp, asparagus, squash, sweet potato) and a california roll. They cut large pieces of fish for their sushi and rolls so you get the right size of fish for the price you pay. The food earns itself the 3 stars.

However, the service.....

is.....

so.............

.................

.................

slow.

It is unbearable. I don&#39;t know any restaurant that makes the customers wait an hour and ten minutes before receiving their food. I would blame it on the restaurant being full, but there are only ten total tables and two sushi chefs. No matter how you do the math, it doesn&#39;t make sense. Also, one of the waitresses looks like she&#39;d be anywhere else than there. Don&#39;t get me wrong, everyone has days they don&#39;t want to go to work. But when you&#39;re in the service industry, you can&#39;t bring it to work.

If you have 3 hours to kill on food that is exactly average, this might be the place for you.

Personal Recommendation: Don&#39;t get the golden shrimp if you like golden sauce, their&#39;s tastes almost purely like egg. Any sushi or roll will probably be your best bet for the money."

I just had the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant at this place.  We didn&#39;t even order due to the way we were treated.  One star is beyond generous for my experience.

Originally their happy hour was from 4-6 but lately they&#39;ve been cutting it back.  My friend arrived just before 5:20 and the woman (owner) told her she needed to order now because happy hour was over.  She pointed out the sign on the front door said it ends at 5:30 and she was given some odd excuse about &#34;it ends at different times depending on how much fish we have.&#34;  Umm...What?

Earlier that day, I had purchased a restaurant.com certificate for $25 for Naomi.  The only stipulation was that you had to spend $37.50 to use it.  There was no mention about it not being valid during happy hour.

Another friend of mine and I joined our previously seated friend at the table.  I had the certificate out so I could tell the server before we ordered but I never even got a chance.  The OWNER came up to us and started YELLING about how they can&#39;t accept that saying things like &#34;you&#39;re already getting a discount&#34; and &#34;we obviously can&#39;t do that, HELLO?!?!?!&#34; and &#34;she was the owner so she makes the rules.&#34;  We tried to tell her the certificate doesn&#39;t say anything about that (we had kind of expected it to be turned down) but she gave us no time to talk.  She then told us it was expired even though I made the purchase less than an hour before arriving at Naomi and the certificate says it never expires.

We got up and left and warned the people walking in about how horribly we were treated.  It is completely unacceptable to yell at your patrons, especially repeat patrons.  Unbelievably terrible experience.  I will never return and will continue to tell others of my nightmare of an experience.  We went to Sushi Yaki in Buffalo Grove instead."

From the outside, it looks like a tiny place in a strip mall, but there&#39;s actually plenty of room inside.  I don&#39;t personally like the decor... bright green walls, paint splashed floors, random sculptures (including a triceratops if you sit in the back booth near the exit sign).  The turtle at the front, though, is a cute touch. 

I&#39;m giving them a four-star review because their rolls are really good, and they have a bunch of their own rolls that I wouldn&#39;t find anywhere else.  For example their black thunder (eel, black rice, scallops) isn&#39;t something I could find normally, and it&#39;s super good!  

I&#39;d suggest coming during happy hour (4-6 PM on weekdays) for 1/2 price sushi.  Note, though, the deal is not for all of their rolls, which is just a small selection (which they must have recently made even smaller than it previously was...). It still has some good deals.

This place has a LOT of specialty rolls, I only wish we got to try all of them. We usually go to sushi buffets rather than standard restaurants, so I was a bit put off by the prices at first, but our bill - three appetizers, two special rolls, two plain rolls, three servings of sashimi, a bottle of wine, a bottle of sake (what can I say... we&#39;re a drinking family), tea, and two desserts - a very reasonable $140 for three people.

Yes, the sushi is good... but the service was sooooo slow.  Naomi is a cute little restaurant, but for some reason when I entered it was completely empty on a Saturday night.  The maki rolls and complementary miso soup were all taste, but the wait between each dish seemed like an eternity.  I also found the rolls to be a bit pricey in comparison to other local sushi restaurants of the same quality.  Maybe I caught them on an off night?  I will have to return and reevaluate.

We ordered a dragon roll, a godzilla roll, 2 salmon sashimi and 2 unagi sashimi. Everything was extremely delicious! The godzilla was so creamy and the small cut pieces were perfect... okay maybe a bit large, but they were cut thin so it was easier to manage. The dragon roll is usually my favorite and it was definitely very tasty. The eel pieces were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had!

I loved the fact that with our meal we got a free salad and miso soup each! Both were very good! The salad didn&#39;t have the wasabi spicy stuff on the top, as most other restaurant do, but I actually liked this better! The miso soup was perfect, not too salty, and the tofu was soft and cut into perfect little squares.

Some of the prices on the menu are a bit steep, like there is aroll for $24, but the rolls that we got were all worth the higher price. PLUS because you get the free salad and miso soup you get more bang for your buck. We ended up paying a very reasonable price for 2 people.

The wait for our food was almost nonexistent. After ordering our sushi, we instantly received our salad, then soup, and as we were finishing our soup we received the sashimi, then dragon and then came the godzilla. I actually really liked how they did things in a certain order.

The decor is so cool! The seats and booths were my favorite part! I like it that on the bench part of the booths were are these soft butt pillows with back on them, very comfy!

We were served by 2 different ladies, and one of the ladies were very cool and kept joking with us. Something triggered a thought to me that the funny knowledgeable lady is the owner, so after we dined we asked the other waitress if it was true, and it was! Oh Naomi is so cool! She did an excellent job with this restaurant.

We were here on a Saturday and the restaurant was pretty empty, which is surprising because the food is great. I assume maybe the hole-in-the-wall look from the outside makes people think that its a lame place. Don&#39;t be fooled! Don&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover and come and try out Naomi&#39;s, you will not be disappointed."

Honestly, wasn&#39;t a fan of the place. It has the dim light, &#34;romantic&#34; setting going on, or at least it TRIES to have that setting going on. For me, the place fails in that respect, it kinda looks cheap, can&#39;t exactly explain it, but it&#39;s no Wildfish, just another copy cat. 

The sushi was very bland, and I mean maybe we didn&#39;t get all the fancy rolls, but I don&#39;t think quality of fish should be judged by the big, special rolls. Overall, the ratio of rice to fish was rice overload, so definitely not a fan of that.  The good news is that no one got sick and that we were surrounded by good company, but overall it was just a okay. This is not a place I personally plan on going unless they really change up their sushi quality. I gave them an extra star for decent service, and some of my friends enjoy this place.

I have been driving past Naomi Sushi on a regular basis for several years now, and had never tried it.  I&#39;ve seen it on Groupon Now a lot, but, as my cousin Lisa tells me (and I&#39;ve proclaimed proudly myself) I am a sushi snob.  I don&#39;t eat sushi everywhere.  I don&#39;t eat grocery store sushi.  I don&#39;t eat questionable sushi, and I don&#39;t eat buffet sushi.  Call me crazy... just... no.

So, on to Naomi Sushi.  Last night, I caved and purchased the Groupon Now.  $25 for $40, not a bad deal for a last minute meal choice.  We got to the restaurant around 8:15, and it did take awhile to be seated, but I can&#39;t fully blame the staff for that.  There was a group of teens trying to pay quickly because their dad&#39;s were waiting outside, and a large party group (10+) being served.  The staff seemed a bit flustered at that point, but quickly recovered.

The ambiance and decor of the place is cute and romantic.  No wonder one of my friends got engaged there.  The mood fits.  Like I said, once we were seated, the staff was friendly and attentive.  My absolute favorite thing about the evening was when we ordered, I ordered Ikura nigiri (salmon roe) and the server told me not to get it, because &#34;it wasn&#39;t great today.&#34;  That is awesome, especially in a sushi restaurant.  Some people may be turned off to the whole experience, but I thanked her, and ordered something else instead.

On to the food:
++ they carry Sapporo, which I prefer to Kirin.
+/- salmon skin roll.  Just okay... I&#39;ve had better.
+ King Dragon roll.  Soft shell crab w/ cukes topped with salmon. mmm.
+++ I forgot the name of the other roll, but it was shrimp tempura w/ cucumber and avocado topped with white tuna.  AMAZING.  The best roll of the night, and my favorite.
- We ordered a side of white rice and never got it.  They took it off the bill right away for us.
- Miso soup was luke-warm and just broth.

I would go back, but only when I have time for a leisurely meal... as others have said, it is a laid back place with... relaxed service."

I drove by Naomi Sushi for a few years - it&#39;s pretty non-descript next to a doctor and a bike store along with a barely visible tavern. You&#39;ll miss the whole strip mall if you blink while driving by.

I finally decided to try it out about a year ago and have been a fan ever since. Some of the best sushi around with interesting specials and custom sushi rolls that a re fresh and crafted with pride. Great appetizers too. Nice decor inside - when I start dating a lady who likes sushi, this is the first place I&#39;ll take her. In the meantime, find me at the sushi bar!

Only downside for me is that I drink diet cola with everything and their portions are all out of a bottle and priced per order. I&#39;d take a star off for this if this were a fast food place, but it isn&#39;t. Just mentioned it for &#34;buyer beware&#34; purposes.

If you like sushi - Naomi is a must!"

You know what, though, they could have been selling out of a basement, and I think I&#39;d come back, the sushi was that good. We had wildfire and volcano rolls that were amazing, especially the volcano rolls! So much flavor and texture with the hot cashew, such a beautiful combination, without anything obnoxious or cheap like teriyaki sauce. Filling too! Even my finicky, sushi-connoisseur friend was impressed. Now let&#39;s see if I can bring her back! Oh, and salad with vinaigrette was refreshing too!

As far as price, you can probably expect $30 for two on a weeknight if you&#39;re ordering specialty rolls. The basic rolls are less (they&#39;re a great price, actually, around $7). Pretty reasonable and way tastier than, say, &#34;Spanish-influenced&#34; (yek!) Wildfire or a few other sushi joints in the area. It&#39;s between B&amp;N and Randhurst, so after shopping go here rather than one of those mediocre restaurants. Keep your eye out! It&#39;s next to Ultra Foods."

We get there and the place is pretty full.  We noticed a few groups of 6 or more people, so we thought it might be a while to get a seat.  They have a nice little waiting area with leather couches and tons of magazines to read.  Luckily for us we only waited 10 minutes before we were finally seated.  With groups of 5 or more, I would recommend trying to get reservations.

Right away I noticed something was odd about their service, it seemed like someone asked for the night off and they were short a person or two as it seemed all the wait staff was a little flustered.  Still they were nice and very apologetic.  

We order the Fried Soft Shell Crab appetizer as well as the Godzilla, Dragon, and Maki Rolls.  My brother and his wife ordered a few other rolls.  I also ordered the Shrimp Tempura.  Oh and the best dish of the night.. the golden turtle.

As I stated earlier, something was off about their service.  We had to remind our server about drinks, then it took 30 minutes for the soup and salad to come out.  They then bring out our first set of rolls, but we never got our appetizers so we said something to our server.  The manager came by and apologized and gave us free drinks.  

When we finally got our Fried Soft Shell Crab, it was good, but very fishy.  So fishy that 2 hours after the dinner I could still taste the fishiness whenever I burped.  :P

Anyways, I tried a couple rolls, but nothing really wowed me.  My girlfriend said the rolls were very oily.  

We were really hoping for a great place to eat sushi, but we were sadly disappointed.  My brother and his wife on their first go at the place said it was really good, so we&#39;re going to try the place out again and see how it fairs to our first outing.  

I really hope that their customer service Saturday night was just a fluke and is not normal."

Great ambience which features privates booths and a trendy Japanese atmosphere.  Their special maki rolls are excellent and are reasonably priced.

+ Half price on SELECTED sushi from 4PM to 6PM on weekdays
+ Sometimes, you can catch a Groupon Now! deal (weekdays only, I believe)
+ Friendly service
+ Sushi is not bad.  It&#39;s not phenomenal....but not bad either.  

The bad:
- The decor! Oh my god! It&#39;s like a distrubed artist ate a Japanese/Gothic &#34;art how-to book&#34; and threw it up in here! Good god! Floor is part-tile, part-cement? The splashes of paint on the floor, the &#34;doctor&#39;s waiting room&#34; area when you come in --- with magazines, the booth with soft lighting.  I don&#39;t get what they were going for when decorating this place. Where&#39;s the zen?  Where&#39;s the elegant/clean and understated way the Japanese decorate? Cue airhead voice: Wha? I don&#39;t get it!

- Slow service. We&#39;ve been here several times and we&#39;ve always had 2 waitresses run the place.  One of the waitresses is also the owner/manager.

- When you come in during the 4PM - 6PM half price time or if you bring in a groupon, the waitresses and/or owner will try to convince you to order more. (Yeah, Ms. Naomi and Ms. Waitress. I am not Korean but I understand you two when you&#39;re talking about your customers in Korean.)  We always get the &#34;friendly&#34; suggestions: &#34;I recommend this lobster sushi.  It&#39;s reaaaaally good!&#34; (Not mentioning: And really pricey! That&#39;s why I&#39;m recommending this to you!) or &#34;How about appetizers and dessert?&#34;  I can spot an upselling strategy from a mile away, sistah!

The bottomline:
- Go for the sushi when you have a coupon or during half-price sushi time. Make sure you come in early so service is a bit faster. Be careful of the upselling. Do not....I repeat.....do not even try to analyze the &#34;artistic&#34; way this place was designed.  You&#39;ll get a headache!"

Loved that the owner (who I believe is Naomi) was very active and passionate about her job and super welcoming and friendly.  My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that the sushi doesn&#39;t all come out at once. Kind of awkward that my rolls came first and I was finished by the time my boyfriend started eating, but it helps that we like to share! Would definitely go back (to try something different on their HUGE menu!) and would recommend to friends."

Moreover, it was next to a bike shop. I kept driving everyday until I had a unbearable sushi craving one night and decided to check it out. 

Do not be fooled by it&#39;s exterior. It is nice and cozy inside with a cute, dim decor. When I came in, i told them I will be dining alone but still preferred a table. The waitress politely smiled, led me to one of the tables, gave me the menu and offered several magazines. She was very attentive. The menu is extensive and lots to choose from. Ultimately, I chose to have the Unagi (see picture I posted). The taste and presentation was wonderful; the prices are reasonable. The staff is very polite and attentive. The food came timely. 

I agree with Bobby&#39;s review. I had a sushigasm that night. 

Although I did not feel uncomfortable dining alone, this place would be great to bring a significant other as it is very dimly lit with a romantic atmosphere. 

They did serve their green tea in tea bags. Minor thing but that disappoints me. If they were going to give great presentations on their food, they should at least serve their tea brewed without a bag and string on it. 

This is one place where you should not judge a book by it&#39;s cover. The exterior store front does not do justice to what you will experience inside."

We enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. When we went - I think the place was still being renovated. They didn&#39;t have space for my family of 5 in the &#34;renovated&#34; area so we sat in an area near by the door. It was very cold and was hard to enjoy dinner. The food was awesome. I didn&#39;t order my usual sushi&#39;s but went with the beef teriyaki from their menu. Pleased with my order. The beef was cooked exactly as I asked. My kids had the chicken teriyaki and no complaints at all from them. The hot tea was good to me. My cup was never empty. Our server accommodated my 2.5yr old and gave us paper for her to draw on. I didn&#39;t notice a kids menu selection - so we were forced to have my older children share and my little one share a big plate with me. The edamame was good to me also. Some places I&#39;ve been to before here taste as if their edamame came out of a microwaveable bag. The hubby had no complaints with his sushi order.

Recommend this place to check out. Kind of hidden in a small stirp mall like area. Parking seems like it would suck if the dental office next door had alot of patients or if Naomi&#39;s was really busy. The original price before my Groupon was of average considering sushi is not cheap."

I just wasn&#39;t impressed with this place at ALL. The rolls are overpriced and underinspired. Almost all the specialty maki were either fried or stuffed with cream cheese. And very few of them had any actual raw fish or eggs. The baby godzilla roll? Mushy. Not good. The best roll I had, spicy tuna, was also the cheapest.

The glass of wine I ordered was also overpriced by at least $1.50 and tasted like it had either been sitting in a fridge for a long time or watered down. 

The ambiance was OK and the staff was friendly, but there&#39;s just no creativity or specialness about the place at all. I&#39;ve had better sushi at just about every Chicago joint I&#39;ve been to. And in other cities, too.

I&#39;ve decided after my second visit I can accurately review what I believed to be true from my initial impression. This place is good.

My first visit to Naomi was inspired by their sign out front that advertises &#34;Best Sushi&#34;. I saw these words and thought to myself &#34;Well I&#39;ll be the judge of that&#34;. It was rather empty inside when we arrived so I was initially wary that my evening would become a fishy nightmare but I kept on with my pursuit for happiness.

The wait staff is ultra friendly and almost seem genuinely excited I&#39;m there to eat their sushi. I&#39;ve had hooters waitresses show me less attention and excitement. 

Food wise the Sushi is tasty. Certainly some of the better sushi in the area. Best? Maybe for the Arlington Heights, Prospect Heights, Mount Prospect area. Both visits the sushi tasted fresh and was quite good. Nothing kills a sushi session more than some semi room temperature dry fish circle stuffed with hardening rice and sticky seaweed. I seem to run into places often that think they can get away with serving that shit to me though. 

Naomi Sushi was so confident in their Baby Godzilla roll&#39;s taste that the waitress informed me I shouldn&#39;t really put much soy sauce on it, if at all, because it was good just the way it was. She was correct.

Affordable tasty sushi close to home. I&#39;m certainly pleased."

A diamond in the rough, located next to a bike shop in a tiny strip mall in front of an abandoned dominicks (I know I know not the best start so far), but the sushi here is to die for. Truly authentic Japanese restaurant, deemed so by a Japanese friend! And Naomi herself is usually the hostess and/or waitress. She has quite the personality and is very good to her regulars. All the sushi is worth getting here, but definitely branch out to the Special Maki&#39;s. Not only are the names fun, but they are TASTY. Godzilla is by far my favorite, but you can&#39;t go wrong with any of them!

We had the nicest waitress I think I&#39;ve ever had, the rolls were delicious, and the presentation of the plates is beautiful. The decor is a little over-the-top for me, I&#39;m not a over-decorated, draperied, water fountained restaurant type of chick.

My first time at Naomi Sushi was on a Friday night, and, as many of the reviews suggest, the place was packed. One tip that I would leave for future diners would be to place a reservation ahead of time. Anyways, back to the good stuff. Their menu is very playful and creative using names like the &#34;godzilla&#34; and &#34;king kong&#34; and it is also very diverse and has something for everyone! If you&#39;re not a fan of raw fish, then there&#39;s also a grill section which features chicken teriyaki and golden shrimp. 

This was my first time here, and I am definitely coming back in the future! If I could give each section of the restaurant a separate score, I would give them each 5 stars out of 5! I highly recommend this place to any sushi fanatic, or any adventurous people who are willing to try this delicacy."

Naomi&#39;s atmosphere is unique and abstract, and is much more traditionally Asian-styled than other sushi restaurants in the area.  I have never had an issue getting seated immediately with a reservation, which is more than I can say for others.

The menu is extensive and not limited to sushi.  From the miso to the maki rolls, the cuisine is excellent.  It is also more traditional than some of the other sushi restaurants in the area.

Neatly tucked in between a bike shop &amp; a dentist office, you can easily miss it or pass it up. We did for the first 3 years living just 5 mins. from it.

The seafood is fresh and the cuts are generous. There isn&#39;t a huge hunk of rice underneath to fill you up needlessly. Their rolls are artfully prepared and we&#39;ve never had to wait an unreasonable time for service or for our food. The waitstaff have all been polite, timely and helpful. Being 4 months pregnant &amp; loving sushi I have to restrain my cravings. They&#39;re understanding &amp; they make sure there isn&#39;t anything raw or inappropriate for me on my plate. Naomi is a sweet woman who seems to remember everyone who walks in through her door. She greets us like we&#39;re family coming over for dinner. 

As the other reviewers said, it is a nice setting for a romantic meal or even just a nice quiet get together meall with some friends. The decor is elegant and there are some artfully draped tables giving you some nice privacy. We went with my family and son (20 months) and everyone had a great time. 

Carry out is good here too! We love eating Naomi Sushi in our jammies while watching a good movie. Carry out is just a fast and artful as dining in."

Imagine my surprise when I found fantastic sushi in this non-descript storefront spot.

Yes, they do get busy. Yes, it can feel understaffed, but the available staff does a tremendous job keeping their tables happy, glasses filled, and plates cleared. It isn&#39;t perfect, but I want my money to go towards great sushi, not feeling like a snotty VIP.

And it is great sushi. From their tiny corner kitchen comes sushi magic. The first time there, I stumbled through the menu and made some great discoveries. The next time, I went with the chef&#39;s choice and enjoyed tremendous rolls, sashimi, and sushi. Everything fresh. Everything tasty. Everything presented well.

I brought a friend who isn&#39;t particularly a sushi fan. He raved about the teriyaki (I was too stuffed with a particularly good dragon roll to try it), so I assume the rest of the menu is just as good.

You must try this place!"

Not many very good sushi places that I&#39;ve found in the suburbs.  As good as Akai Hana in Wilmette; way, way, way, better than Yummy Sushi....best sushi I&#39;ve found so far in Arlington heights.  I&#39;d put it against anything in Chicago as a price/wait in line performer (I can&#39;t imagine anyone ever having to wait in line)

Staff is a little odd... I think it&#39;s a combination of not being really busy and an interesting owner...I&#39;m thinking of a certain Seinfeld episode

I ordered the Philadelphia, the spicy tuna and the rainbow, which only came out to about $20, being very reasonable! The staff were very nice and accommodating as well. 
The Philadelphia roll was just cream cheese wrapped in rice with a piece of salmon thrown on top. Nothing else! I expected some kind of veggies or avocado or SOMETHING more inside. The spicy tuna was ok. It was actually wrapped in seaweed on the outside, tasting more like kimbob than sushi, but it was good enough. Finally the rainbow roll. Yikes. It wasn&#39;t just crab but some kind of crab mix/salad. Maybe it&#39;s because they were packing up and it wasn&#39;t as fresh as it could have been, but I paid dearly for that one later.  I will definitely be on the lookout for other sushi places in the future."

It&#39;s that good.  Two full pages of appetizers (hot and cold), one for a nigiri, one for traditional maki rolls, another for special rolls, another for Naomi signatures, another for combinations, and then they have other non-sushi entrees and desserts.  Good drinks too.  It&#39;s intense. 

The decor is a cute and darkened, with some of the central tables draped almost like private booths.  You&#39;re always well-taken care of and they&#39;re willing to help guide you through the menu and make suggestions.  If Naomi herself is working that evening, you&#39;ll have an absolute ball.  She&#39;s adorable.

We&#39;ve never tried any of the non-sushi dishes; why would you?  The rolls here are massive, fresh, beautifully presented and delicious. We&#39;re not talking those little six piece rolls you can find at the Jewel.  These are full-bodied masterpieces, with healthy portions of fish, not just lots of rice to flesh them out.  The signatures and specials are all great if you&#39;re adventurous, but even the standards are done in a way that makes them superior to anywhere else.

And the best part?  The prices run the same as sushi you get at the Jewel or that dumpy little take-out place around the corner from your place.  Honestly, it&#39;s kind of a problem. The quality and price of Naomi makes me angry to get sushi anywhere else because I&#39;m paying the same amount as Naomi for inferior food.

I know it seems odd that the best Sushi I&#39;ve found is in Arlington Heights, thousands of miles from any ocean.  But I&#39;ll keep making the trek out there, for sure."

I believe we might have had Naomi herself today as our server, &amp; she is just so awesome. My husband &amp; i are both vegetarians &amp; on our first visit she noticed from across the room that we were not eating our free Miso soup (we had assumed it would contain some soft of fish) &amp; she came over to inform us that it was completely vegetarian, as she had presumed that we were vegetarians by the order we placed. She&#39;s so sweet! 

When we were back today she remembered us &amp; showed us all the options on the menu we had as vegetarians. While there were not all that many vegetarian options for us on the menu, she went out of her way to tell us about a few rolls they could make *specifically* for us. We had one that she made up for us &amp; it was so unbelievably good! Very different, &amp; very tasty.

The owner is nice, and hope he takes action in correcting this issue, maybe with a meeting on customer service to his cashiers and a workplace ethic review. The cashiers have too much attitude, with the exception of the male that use to work there, he was always pleasant and the new girl they just hired is friendly too. Here&#39;s a couple incidents that led to my updated unsatisfied review:

1. I came in one date before the lunch rush, I walked in on a cashier with her back turned to me giving the cooks attitude, yelling at them. The cooks inform the sassy cashier that a customer has walked in and she needs to turn around and take my order and she responds with &#34;I know someone walked in, I&#39;ll turn around when I want to.&#34; About 15 seconds of awkward silence with her back still turned to me went by and she then turns around and takes my order. RUDE. I debated saying something, but I decided not to as I come here too often and don&#39;t want to be perceived as the crazy customer. 

2. I go through the drive thru and place my order. I get to the window and they hand me my food and quickly close the window on me. I didn&#39;t even get to tell them that they forgot to hand me my drink. So I wait there for like 5 minutes knocking on the window, and a nice man comes to the window I tell him that they forgot to give me my Pepsi. He gets me my drink, but it was Diet Pepsi, sigh, I hate Diet Pepsi....I drove away, I didn&#39;t feel like knocking on the window and waiting longer.

3. Today I went in and ordered to go. They start making my order to eat in, I see that and quickly inform them that its to go. The cashier then expresses her frustration with a low grunt. I open up my bag when I arrive to my office and I see that the order for a &#34;meatball on the side&#34; was placed in my pasta...which would have been fine if it was just my order. I wanted it on the side to give to a coworker.  

I do have to say this isn&#39;t the case every time I come in, as I&#39;ve been here over a handful of times in the course of several years, but It was just these recent situations that made me feel the need to make Avanti aware. In all the time I&#39;ve been going here I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before, my visits are usually sweet and short."

We also go here a lot just for dinner, usually ordering the same stuff that we order with catering. The pasta is to die for.

My mom, who&#39;s 85, was sick last week. So I called Avanti for delivery. I sent her split pea soup, lasagne and a tuna sub. She raved and raved about the best split pea soup ever, loaded with prosciutto and veggies. And she seriously raved for two days, couldn&#39;t wait to get more!. She called to find out when she should buy it again, and went out in sub zero weather to get more today. She was so disappointed. No prosciutto, none,  watery and not much flavor.

We went Saturday, drove 50 mins. Meh. I had the mushy escarole soup which had maybe 7 beans and one piece of thin sliced sausage. I ordered the arancini, which was nuked and ice cold in the middle. We wanted to try a little bit of everything so I ordered the diavolo sub. It came without the Italian dressing or any other condiment.

My husband ordered his favourite Italian sausage sandwich.  It tasted steamed, certainly not grilled. Kind of mushy. 

We also ordered onion rings, they were okay, pricy at almost $5, and took way longer than the rest of the food."
