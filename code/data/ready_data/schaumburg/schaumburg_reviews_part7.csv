Will absolutely return and put this on my &#34;favorite places to eat in Chicago area&#34; list. Sesame chicken, homemade noodles, fried rice, and Mongolian beef were all phenomenal and felt clean. Not covered in too much sauce. 

Clean and exquisite atmosphere. The place was filled with Asian people (always a good sign). Server was quick, kind, funny, and helpful! I lived in Hong Kong for a time and the food experience here reminded me of some of my great experiences there. Ended our meal with the lychee ice cream to share and it was great! Thank you Chef Ping!!!"

We went on a Saturday night with a group of 6.. we had a 7:15 reservation and got to sit around 7:30 not too bad considering they were very busy...
But they didn&#39;t have enough forks to give us so when dinner arrived we could not eat
When we sat they were also out of water glasses
Then it was no wonton noodles...
Thy seems out of many basic items...

Overall nice 

Best dish was the walnut shrimp
The beef broccoli tasted metallic 

Wonton soup very good

I&#39;d say go but know that due to crowd it&#39;s long wait times and thy may not have enough basic utensils to serve you properly"

Boy, were we disappointed.

We did a carry-out dinner order. 

Pretty standard order of egg rolls...lemon chicken and sweet and sour shrimp.

All of it was really bad.

I&#39;ll start with the egg rolls. The strangest egg rolls I&#39;ve ever had from a Chinese restaurant. They were filled with ingredients not normally found in your standard egg rolls. Long, thin, greasy and they just didn&#39;t taste quite right.

On to the lemon chicken....

The chicken inside the fried outer shell tasted like it had been left over from lunch...from the day before. It was really unappealing.

Speaking of unappealing. How &#39;bout that sweet and sour shrimp?

Unpleasant to look at and eat. Who leaves the tails on in sweet and sour shrimp? Chef Ping, that&#39;s who! Awful all around.

The rice wasn&#39;t good either (and yes, the rice carton has that &#34;bad breath&#34; smell...you know what I&#39;m talking about).

It was our first and last time with food from Chef Ping.

In a word, &#34;yuck&#34;!"

A lot of really authentic Chinese places tend to either have terrible customer service or somewhat decent customer service but a language barrier for some.  When I called here, you could hear all of the commotion in the background but the woman speaking to me was courteous and professional. She even repeated my order a couple of times back to me because it was a bit hard to hear with all of the noise.

I ordered my favorite dish: pork belly with preserved vegetables (comes with pancakes), ping&#39;s noodle platter, egg rolls, and the Fuchi faepian- a cold Sichuan dish that has marinated beef and tripe.  The cold dish was delicious and the flavor and spice was spot on!    The noodles had shrimp, scallop, pieces of squid and the container hardly closed.  Hell, even the egg rolls were perfectly fried.  Their egg rolls are what I would consider the smaller (smooth) egg rolls and not the fat ones that are dipped in egg yolk first.  I only mention this because I&#39;m a huge fan of the small ones and not so much of the large ones.  What was even more impressive was the portion and pricing for everything.  I feel like I&#39;ve been eating on the pork belly and the noodles for a week now and still have some leftover.

The only reason why this gets a four star besides a 5 is because the preserved vegetables (supposed to be like sour and salty) was really sugary.  I&#39;m thinking that whoever cooked it made the classic error of mixing up the salt and the sugar.  I didn&#39;t find out until I got home but it was obviously too sweet, which was a huge disappointment because I ended up throwing away everything in the dish other than the pork because it was SO sweet!  Such a shame!  With that being said, the pork was very tender and tasted wonderful on it&#39;s own or with the pancake.  Also, the rice also was mushy like someone added way too much water cooking it.  However, I didn&#39;t really care about the rice because I already had my noodle dish waiting for me.  

Takeaway: If you&#39;re a fan of cold Chinese apps, try the fu chi fae pian.  I know I will definitely be coming back to try more of their menu!"

I would prefer Chef Pings over Yu&#39;s Mandarin any day.  The only bad part is that there is usually a wait (30 mins to an hr?)  if you go without making a reservation.

Food
Noodles in Black Bean Sauce [in Korean it is called &#34;Jjajangmyun&#34;] - the portion is big and can be shared between 2 people or if you&#39;re extremely hungry, one person can finish the bowl and be full (to the point that you feel like you cannot breathe anymore.. sort of.. )

Sweet &amp; Sour Beef [in Korean it is called &#34;ttangsooyuk&#34;] - the option might not be in the menu because usually it is pork, but I prefer beef rather than pork.  The beef is battered &amp; fried perfectly then the sauce is poured over it.  Delicious and definitely a must try for all!! 

Atmosphere - great for groups/families, but expect to wait longer if you are in a group. [If you plan on going with a group of people, reservations are recommended]

Customer Service - ok, it really depends on who your waiter/waitress is...

I would recommend this Chinese restaurant [can&#39;t really find a restaurant like this one in the loop unfortunately :(].  The options here are pretty tasty &amp; portions are good for sharing!"

pretty good and the service is great. You can request to modify dishes like take out ham, or chicken, if you only want the fried rice to have shrimp. You can also request for Sriracha sauce. You&#39;ll need it if you like spicy because we requested everything spicy and it was not spicy at all. The Crab Rangoon is delicious!! 

I would suggest you buy dishes and share them because they are huge servings and can feed two people at least. For example, if you have three people, order two dishes and rice separately. Why separately? Because the rice that comes with your dish is a very small portion. 

Service is great here. They&#39;ll check up on you frequently and they&#39;ll pack up the food for you too if you have leftovers. It felt like we had a &#34;team&#34; of waiters."

I guess since I love so many dishes, I should have listed the ones that were not my faves: mango chicken and sesame chicken.

  We have ordered both the egg rolls and the crab rangoon from here. The egg rolls are delicious but small, when you see that they are $1.50 each.. you&#39;ll be amazed at how little band you get for your buck. The crab rangoon is the worst I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s more like a dessert than an appetizer.. They would be better without the nutmeg.

  The orange chicken is interesting, it&#39;s more like a BBQ style which was great until you look at the quality of the chicken inside.

It was dinner time, fairly packed. Even though it was a Friday night, the wait time was short (10 minutes or so), perhaps we were lucky. Plan accordingly if you&#39;re hungry and wish to avoid the crowd. The place is huge with two dining areas and a nice ambiance.

We ordered the Pong pong chicken, Sczechwan Eggplant and Gan Pong Diced chicken. They were all good. But I think every item that we ordered were breaded, deep fried and full of oil. That was my only qualm but otherwise it was good. 

Portions are huge and we probably ordered way too much. Next time gotta avoid going all wild and ordering so much.

The chefs keeping walking around occasionally to monitor stuff as well. Bring up any issues if you have to them. It&#39;s a nice way to personalize the experience and receive active feedback."

My family ordered the ping&#39;s chicken wing, pork shu mai, shrimp dumpling, and combination chow mein. The food was cooked perfectly and the waiter did inform us that the pork shu mai would take around 25 minutes to be ready. Ping&#39;s chicken wings is one of their specialty dishes that almost everyone gets. I totally agree with them as well.  

The service was very good and our waiter was very attentive if we needed any refills or additional items. The pricing is very reasonable as well with the quality and serving of food you get.

I love chicken wings. While some say the PongPong have no meat and are just fried bones these are my go to asian flavor wings. Sweet with some spice and nice crispy bits. I don&#39;t get tired of eating these!!

Shrimp dumplings, another Chef Ping staple for me. Pieces of shrimp in a nicely steamed wrapper. 

Hunan beef &amp; chicken. I always order this, why, I don&#39;t know, the flavor is so good to me...

Pad Thai. This is one that went downhill. I love the noodle (Wide) which you don&#39;t see as much anymore, but the sauce on this dish is flavorless. Just look at the photos people post here. Barely any color and it tastes like it. To bad as I love Pad Thai."

Fast and respectful service, I think the waiter gave my whole party a choice of soup or salad to start off even though maybe it only came with a lunch special? 

Also, I was impressed by the amount of customers they had on a weekday.

We ordered sesame chicken, garlic chicken, pong pong chicken?, jampong and jajang. 

The sesame and garlic chicken came with rice an egg roll and a wonton crisp. They were perfectly prepared and not soggy at all!! I just didn&#39;t really like the garlic chicken - too strong, there&#39;s a weird after taste.. But that&#39;s my fault I guess. The sesame was amazing!

The pong pong chicken was supposed to be spicier than kanppungi which is the Korean spicy chicken wings.. But it was very mild. Haha maybe it&#39;s cause we&#39;re so used to Great Sea&#39;s spicy, sweet, big kanppungi that the pong pong was a little underwhelming. But by no means was it not enjoyable!

The jjajangmyun was thick and big portioned which is always good. You should ask for an extra bowl of sauce cause for the amount of noodles Chef Ping holds back that delicious black bean sauce.. it&#39;s so good why not have more to smother all over your face - I mean the noodles.. :)

Now the only let down today was the jampong. The broth was not spicy and refreshing like it should be, but more milky and mild? I think Chef Ping doesn&#39;t like to make things too spicy in order to cater to the non-Asian customers, which they have many! But again, great big portion :)

Overall, I would definitely come again, but just skip the jampong."

I know, I know, there is MSG in like, everything. But once it hits a certain threshold in my system, I get this crazy, major, crawl into bed and hope to die migraine.

My favorite dishes are their mu shu pork and kung pao chicken. The mu shu pork is served in one container, with plum sauce and pancakes on the side so nothing gets messy when you do take out.

Being asian, I&#39;ve gone to plenty of Chinese food Restaurants. But this place tops the cake for having the worst service I have ever experienced.

PROS:
-Restaurant is decently clean.
-Food tastes Ok.

CONS:
-Service is terrible! And when I say terrible, I mean it. The Chinese lady who slightly served our table (Her name is Hong) demanded a higher tip on my $75 bill. Stating that 3 dollars wasn&#39;t enough. However a tip is given for a job well done. She did nothing of the sort. She ignored us, food was served by a 6 different staff. She gave awesome service to the american families around us, but completely treated us like garbage. As we were walking out of the restaurant, she hails us down, demanding we give her more. My father-in-law doesn&#39;t speak much english, so she hounded him for more money.
-Earlier I said restaurant is clean, and it is for the most part. Seats are well taken care of, and most of the restaurant from what I can see. However, I had to fight my food with at least 5 Flies. Talk about gross.

Honestly, I would rather go to Panda Express than this joke of a restaurant. This is one of the worst Chinese Restaurants I have ever gone to, period."

Their walnut shrimp, szechuan shrimp, 12 ingredient tofu in a pot, hot pepper beef, and summer salad are also great too.

The noodles aren&#39;t too chewy, the black bean sauce isn&#39;t too salty and has a nice balance of sweetness, and the meat is crispy even after sitting in the sauce for a little bit. If you haven&#39;t tried these two items, I&#39;d highly recommend it. I mean, who would try &#34;Noodles in Black Bean Sauce&#34; if you didn&#39;t actually know what it was?

There&#39;s often a wait to get into the restaurant. On a Saturday evening, my girlfriend and I had to wait around 45 minutes to get in without a reservation. (We made the decision to come here spontaneously.) It&#39;s definitely worth the wait. The food here is a lot less greasier than I Chinese food I&#39;ve tried at other restaurants around here, and the interior is spacious and pleasant to be in.

Not as good as some of my favorites back home, but a great choice for Chinese food outside of Chinatown in Chicago."

We ordered the following:

1. Homemade stir fried spicy noodles - it&#39;s ok. Spicy, but lacked flavor. 

2. Chinese broccoli - tasted fresh and probably the best thing we ordered. 

3. Chicken lollipops - this was so disappointing. It was skin and bones. They took out all of the meat! If you like this dish... You must visit Great Seas restaurant in Albany Park of Chicago. It is called &#34;spicy chicken.&#34; Much better and more nutritional. I could get 10 chicken lollipops with rice and still be hungry."

Pros:
- nice atmosphere 
- good food in general
- friendly service

Cons:
- the crab Rangoon tastes odd (has mustard?)
- the wait staff tries to rush you to order if there&#39;s a line at the door

Service: I have gone to this restaurant multiple times, and I have noticed a pattern with the seating: all of the Asians are seated first and foremost with prime seats. I&#39;m not being a bigot, but it is true and hinted at by the waiters&#39; behavior.

Food: The food is different every time I&#39;ve gone there. I ordered the Sweet &amp; Sour chicken one time and received extremely tasty and delectable food. The next time I ordered it, I received Panda Express quality food. The same thing has happened with the Beef &amp; Broccoli and the egg rolls.

Hope this sends a notice to ownership of  Chef Ping.   Based on my 9/4 &amp;  9/24/2016 visits,  owner must drastically improve the time the food is ordered and delivered to the customer&#39;s table. 

9/4 visit,  one of the simple dishes we ordered (Orange Beef) never arrived after 
ONE HOUR from order.  After 30 min, our waitress kept telling us she was checking, but there&#39;s was a wait.  After ONE HOUR when our other food was eaten, but cancelled the order.

9/25 visit,    we ordered a vegetable dish,  orange beef (again),  sizzling beef dish, and fried fish.  From the time we ordered,  It took about 20 minutes for our vegetable dish to arrive.   After that,  it took another 30 minutes for our orange beef &amp; fish dishes to arrive.    Then,  another 15 minute for our final dish the Sizzling Beef platter to arrive.  Unfortunately,  the sizzling beef, NEVER came out on a sizzling platter.

When I complained to our waitress on 9/25 she was very apologetic,  and did acknowledge the kitchen was busy/backed up.  While I was doing this, the family next to us had the same issue. 

If the kitchen is understaffed,  owners better get more help,  plain and simple."

Chef Ping was our first and became our favorite local restaurant in the Schaumburg area. When we moved again in 2013, we chose to commemorate the occasion by eating our last lunch at Chef Ping&#39;s as well.  ;_;

The atmosphere inside is very welcoming and &#34;upscale casual&#34;, with dark woods, simplistic style, and peaceful piano music. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and always able to recommend something tasty. The menu includes a variety of traditional, fusion, and &#34;Americanized&#34; Chinese dishes, so you can really try many different things each time you go!

* They also have a special room for larger dinner parties! (We held one of the hubby&#39;s birthdays there!)
* The wait on the weekends can be long if you haven&#39;t made a reservation! This place is awesome and people know it!
* We live 1 and 1/2 hours away now and we STILL drive out of our way to Chef Ping&#39;s to carry-out our favorites!

Their Mongolian beef is probably one of the best I have ever had, it literally melts in your mouth. I also really like their combination fried rice, as well as their wings.

I&#39;ve been a longstanding customer of this place. I recommend jajang myun (noodles with black bean sauce) and pong pong chicken (fried chicken legs on bone with sweet and spicy sauce).

This is a casual place and they accommodate large parties. 

They only accept reservations for parties of 6 or more.

Ask for the radish and onion with black bean sauce if you love flavor explosion in your mouth. It&#39;s free and it&#39;s complementary to the noodle dishes."

Utter &#34;Chef Ping&#34; amongst the Chinese or Korean that live in the burbs and chances are that they go here for their family style Chinese/Korean meals.  

They do try to stress the quality of service here especially for the larger tables in the back with plate swapping near the middle of your menu. 

Some items that we usually have for family meals included the honey walnut shrimp.  JaJa mein (though its never a favorite of mine).  Salt and Pepper tofu (must get), The pong pong chicken (make sure to get extra rice for all the sauce haha!). Schezwan green beans are delicious.  But garlic stir fried pea shoots for $16?!   come on now...8 treasure rice for dessert is a different kind of dessert (not overly sweet)  which Ping does fairly well.  

Chef Ping is a bit pricier and portions a bit smaller than the restaurants in Chinatown for family style meals, but still better than the alternative of driving from the burbs thru the traffic nightmare of the loop.

In fact, the food is among the worst I have had in the greater Chicago area. The Sesame Chicken was so over-cooked it was powder dry in the middle - it also had way too much batter and way too little sauce. How can they blow a basic dish like Sesame Chicken? We had the Sweet Sour Fish and the fish was tasteless and the sauce was just plain weird.  The portions in general are quite small also, and all the dishes were quite greasy (too much oil). We also had the signature crab dish with salted egg (&#34;Gold Dust&#34;) coating. Wow, the crab was over-cooked and the meat was completed dry inside the shells. To add insult to injury, the crab shells were not pre-cracked and they did not provide any cracker tool or special fork. We asked several times for a crab cracker tool and waited 10 minutes before one arrived. The crab was all cold by then. POOR SERVICE.

Talking about poor service... we ordered 8 dishes. The last two dishes were still 80% full and they came and gave us the check and asked us if we needed anything else. I was literally still picking food from the dish when the waiter came and took them away for boxing. Given someone at our table give the waiter permission to do so, but he only did it because he felt pressured. It was 6:30 and they were people waiting for tables. So, I understand they want to turn over the tables quickly. But come on, at least let people finish their food in peace. BAD FOOD &amp; BAD SERVICE. I don&#39;t know how this place got a 4 star rating. 

Also, in terms of dining ambience, because the place is so crowded, they pack the tables close together. So the place feel very stuffy, you feel cramped and it so noisy it&#39;s hard to hear your dinning companions.

Be warned!"

Service thou,sometimes not the greatest.
When I go out I do it for he whole experience. Service and food.otherwise I can stay home and cook as good as any!
I agree that is very busy at times,however when you wait 45 minutes or so to be seated,than another 5-10 to even be aknolaged,it&#39;s bad.(you can&#39;t make reservations unless are 6 or more people)
Here you are, very hungry and frustrated. and you don&#39;t want to order the same Mongolian beef,you ask the server to help you figure out what&#39;s what. you stare at the menu than at the server and again at menu. You have to decide alone !!!!! No help!
I have a suggestion: pictures accompanied by short list of ingredients.
One time, me and my husband ordered appetizers, soup and a main dish.
We got all the food at once but the soup was forgotten. When half an hour into our dinner I asked about the soup,the server mumbled something and ran into the kitchen. He came back telling us &#34;coming,coming now. We canceled the order,it was to late.I expected an apologie but I got a pair of eyes pinning me in my chair.
Again, the food is fresh, well cooked and elevated as far as Chinese food goes. 
Maybe the owners should invest equal effort in finding servers that play the part of a Chinese restaurant in America .
Language and understanding it is important, specially if you live and work here.
Lack of intelligent communication,even if is only for  food and entertainment, can tarnish any potentially great experience.
It&#39;s good to go dinning here when is less busy so you feel like a patron of the restaurant and not next in line at any fast food store.
Even Wendy&#39;s gives you more respect!

The other reviews are right, wait times can be excessive. However, you will understand why once you enjoy the food! 

We came in on a busy Tuesday night. It was a ten-minute wait for a table, so we decided to eat at the bar area. No regrets, we actually found it quieter and easier to have a conversation. 
Service here is always top-notch. Regardless of the crowds. 

We always start our meal here with a fresh bowl of soup. 
The wonton soup is excellent and is served piping hot! 
My father usually orders the Hot n&#39; Sour Soup and raves about it. 

The menu here has some &#34;americanized&#34; selections, however they do offer favorites for those craving a taste from back home. You know it is good when you see a ton of oriental people packing the restaurant! (I say this with the utmost respect!) 

Next, we ordered the Mandarin Soy Duck! It was hands-down the best duck we&#39;ve ever had. It is served at room-temp and is utterly amazing. The duck is so tender and the mandarin soy marinade just made it melt in your mouth! If you are a duck person, you must give it a try. 

The hot dishes as I mentioned before, are mostly americanized. However, do not let this shy you away. Chef Ping is NOT your typical &#34;americanized&#34; chinese joint. 

My favorite dish here is the Kung Pao Beef, when it comes to &#34;americanized&#34; dishes. 
The beef is so tender you barely have to chew. It is incredible. 
Plus, if you love it spicy like I do, just ask them to make it extra spicy. 
Chef Ping uses incredible seasonings and technique to raise the bar on Chinese Cuisine. 

Another favorite is the Salt n Pepper Smelt or Ping&#39;s Noodle Soup. 
The noodles are homemade and served in an amazing (spicy) broth abundant with veggies, squid, and shrimp! The Noodle soup is enough for 2 (maybe 3) people! 

As with all portions at Chef Ping, you can feed 2-3 people from any entree. 

Simply put, Chef Ping is the undisputed best in Chicago and in my opinion, the whole state!
Give it a try, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

We showed up at 6:30pm on a Friday and were told it was a 45 minute wait for us 4. It ended up being about 25-30 minutes, which was a nice surprise.

The service is really friendly, prompt, and the food comes out quickly. Our server made good recommendations when we were trying to figure out what to get from one part of the menu, say, the beef section. When we got all our dishes, we realized that three of them are kind of large combo platters (the Summer Salad, Noodle Platter, &amp; Seafood Combo) and fairly similar. I wish our server could&#39;ve noticed this and mentioned something about it.

Smaller than I&#39;d expected; the tofu had a nice &amp; thin breading to it, but with such thick pieces, even though they&#39;re flavored on the outside, most of each piece doesn&#39;t have much flavor on the inside.

The beef comes in huge slices and is incredibly satisfying to chew through, the meat is so good! The large mushroom slices are great too; they&#39;re not too overpowering as I often find with everyday Chinese dishes with mushroom.

I didn&#39;t love the flavors in this - I could definitely taste the mustard/horseradish throughout, which was an odd pairing for me, and having a cold dish in November in the Midwest just isn&#39;t as comforting as the hot dishes.

Food quality is consistently good. They do tend to get busy, but that&#39;s because of how good it is.  They do a robust to-go business as well, mainly for that reason. 

On weekends, prepare for a wait, but during the week you shouldn&#39;t have any trouble. 

My favorites include Mongolian Beef, General Tso&#39;s Chicken, and Peking Duck - all are prepared in a way that&#39;s consistent with the superior options in Chinatown, or on the West coast.  When you see significant numbers of Chinese people eating at a Chinese restaurant, it says something.

Been coming here for years. The food and service have always been good. Recently I came and ordered the same thing I always get. What the server brought was not at all what I was expecting. The dish was different, in both taste and form. When I called the server over to ask if they had switched recipes she insisted that what she brought was indeed correct. She insisted I asked for the wrong thing. Instead of trying to make things right she just took the dish away and didn&#39;t offer an alternative. So while the rest of my party ate their dishes I got to sit and watch them. It wasn&#39;t until later that the server got the idea to see if I&#39;d like something else. Sorry, but too late, the damage had been done.

It&#39;s unfortunate that this happened because I&#39;ve been coming here for a number of years. I think this place has become too popular for its own good. I feel that they no longer care about it&#39;s customers which is why I no longer care to spend my money here.

This last time was last month while we were in town for the wedding. They had the rehearsal dinner here on a Friday night.

Summer salad: Cold, hot and mustard salad on bean noodle, big serving. I&#39;d never had this dish before. It was cold and refreshing, but had a really nice kick from the hot mustard.

Pong pong chicken: Hot &amp; tangy sauce on a chicken lollipop. Yum! Sticky, garlicky, sweet, savory. Rivals my favorite wings in SF.

Lady mao&#39;s bean curd: Well known folk dish, tofu with minced pork. Great with some rice!

Gan pong shrimp: Original recipe dated back to the old san tung province, burned hot pepper with chopped garlic glaze. A shrimp version of the chicken wings I love?! Yes please! First time having this dish and I loved it!

Combination fried rice: Shrimp, chicken, ham with a touch of soy sauce. Nicely fried and full of flavor! The kids loved this!

Beef with peppers, onions and carrots: I don&#39;t remember this dish too well, but I do remember the beef and veggies were stir fried well.

Asian style sweet and sour beef: I don&#39;t really like sweet and sour dishes but the roommate&#39;s brother loves it!

Walnut shrimp: Jumbo shrimp in rich creamy sauce with honey coated walnuts and steamed broccoli. Yum! The shrimp were big and juicy!

Sea cucumber and scallops with mushrooms, cauliflower and peas: I loved the scallops and veggies in this dish!

Sauteed baby bok choy: Bok choy was cooked well and flavor was nice and garlicky.

Noodles in black bean sauce: Pork, baby shrimp, onion &amp; zucchini slow cooked in black bean sauce served over homemade noodles. The roommate loves this dish. And the kids were enjoying it as well.

Ping&#39;s noodle soup: Noodle in spicy broth cooked with fine shredded pork, seafood and vegetables. One of my favorite dishes! The soup was spicy and savory and dish was full of seafood and veggies!

Service was good, but it took some time for the last two dishes to come out. I understood since everything was pre ordered except those two. And every table was adding several orders of the last two dishes.

And when you go to an amusement park, you shouldn&#39;t be disappointed because their hot dogs aren&#39;t as good as Paradise Pup, or that their hamburgers don&#39;t rivel those from Red Robin.

As much as some people like to make fun of guys wanting to go to Hooters for reasons other than food, we honestly love going here for their 911 wings.  For a chain restaurant, they serve heck of tasting wings.  Their 911 sauce wings have been my favorite for a long time.  That&#39;s how I get them whenever I go here.  There are times where we ask for 911 BBQ and quite often we have had the best of both worlds - the hot &amp; super spicy 911 sauce and the sweet, tasty BBQ sauce.  The combo is heavenly when done right.  Be sure to ask for your wings double dip and wet if you are a fan of their sauces.  That usually ensures your wings being nicely coated with their sauce and them not being dry.  I don&#39;t compare this place with Buffalo Wild Wings as some do cause to me Hooters came first and have consistently served big, tasty wings.  Buffalo Wild Wings have good sauce but their wings are puny.  

Chicken wings, Buffalo shrimp, and Mexicurly fries is where its at. We order that usually when we want more than just wings.

20 minutes later we get our appetizers and kids food. 
5 minutes later we got our meals. 
No ask for refilled drinks. If everything was okay it was as if this entire patio was neglected. 
OH &amp;&amp; the table next to me was still not cleaned. 
So it starts raining so we push all of our food into boxes grab the baby&#39;s and hurry in mind u the group of hooters girls are starring at us. Not asking/ offering help just staring and laughing. 
OKAY great so I&#39;m inside our server bagged out boxes and we paid the tip and were thanked for coming in. 
I won&#39;t be back the service was the worst I&#39;ve ever had I won&#39;t name my server but she is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I didn&#39;t tip well because well she didn&#39;t serve well. Sorry  
* clean ur bathrooms 
* be attentive &amp; prompt. 
I shouldn&#39;t be searching for my server. 
We almost got up and walked to UNOS pizzeria 3 times. Should have!"

Today we got served the smallest wings I have ever seen. When I spoke to the manager about it he said it was a seasonal (industry wide) thing. Really?! Like I don&#39;t know anything about wings. I have literally never seen wings this small! Excuses are for losers and you just lost my business for good.

Beer was served cold, selection was decent. We only ordered the wings so can&#39;t comment on the rest of the food. Wings had way too much grease-soaked breading and the sauce was very scant.

Not a place I regret going, but not a place I would go back again. Used to always like visiting Hooters to throw back a few cold ones and enjoy the decor, can&#39;t say I feel the same way anymore."

The wings are the main focus here, as they are known for their wings. 
This time, the wings were cooked perfectly, as were the curly fries, and steamed shrimp. 

The service was also top notch, maybe they knew it was me, but keep up the great work!

I ordered blackened Mahi-Mahi, and it wasn&#39;t even close to blackened, more like whitened mahi- mahi.   Had no taste what so ever. After I took a bite they took it back and added some more spices and re-grilled it to make it blackened.  That&#39;s right, that was after I took a bite...just wow.

I was disappointed that there was nothing appealing on the menu - aside from tater tots. I do love me some tots.

Anywho ... I decided on the honey bbq boneless wings, because if I do eat wings, they better not be a bone in &#39;em. Then they are just like breaded hunks of chicken and that I can do. They were good .... nothing to write home about - and when I had seen that the smallest portion was 10, I thought for sure I&#39;d be going home with a bunch of leftovers. Yeah, not so much.

The food hasn&#39;t changed but my ability to eat it certainly has.  lol  I&#39;ve always loved the wings...meaty and spicy (or as spicy as you want them)...but since this isn&#39;t a food I eat regularly anymore I can&#39;t offer a comparison to more recent wing places that have popped up.

What do I order?  Samuel Adams!  Curly fries to start!  911 Wings!  Blue Cheese and celery!  Yea!  

What also hasn&#39;t changed is the theme...female servers in tight t-shirts (get it?  Nudge nudge...Hooters?) and little orange shorts.  It&#39;s a bit tired.  It&#39;s also a bit...pointless...since hiring standards have relaxed since the good ol&#39; days and so...um...nevermind.  I just think that if you&#39;re going to keep hammering away at the same old theme with the little outfits and the bikini pictures on the walls you might want to...um...nevermind.  I think the audience for the sexy server thing has moved on to more modern places like The Tilted Kilt.  And that means........

Hooters is now a solid family place.  You see more babies and toddlers here than groups of ogling bachelors.  Lots of the kinds of foods kids like and the atmosphere is fun for them.  I think a lot of women have the impression that Hooters is just one step short of a strip club but no.  I&#39;ve never been uncomfortable at any Hooters.

One thing I have to give a shout out to the servers for is the KINDNESS I see in so many of their hearts.  I&#39;ve observed that a lot of solitary guys go there to eat.  A lot of disabled guys go there to eat.  The ladies at Hooters are warm and attentive to these guests.  That&#39;s an unexpected sweetness."

They were complaiming that they tasted funny,  i thought hogwash, but then i tried one and they were right.  It was very disaapointing, that we loss our appetite.  We didnt get sick from them but they were seriously off.   The mild wings barely had anything on them and what was on the bottom of the container didnt even look like sauce.  More like greasy sauce.   I also noticed that some of the wings even had little strands of feathers on them..  i mean who cleans them..?   Maybe they need to change their frying oil..
 
Even the ranch they gave us didnt taste right.   Did they switch supplier?

Really godawful.

We ordered boneless wings with curly fries on the side. When we got the &#34;wings,&#34; which were the size of McNuggets, the sauce was non existant. So we pointed this out to the manager and got a side of hot sauce which was still all butter, no buffalo.

Service was non-existant; no one was tending to our drink refills. Instead, the server just nonchalantly dropped the check on our table and walked away without acknowledging us.

At this point I was upset enough to summon a manager about this experience. The manager kept asking how we got the sauces instead of focusing on my concerns of the (lack of) taste in both the &#34;chicken&#34; and the sauce as well as the bad service from the server. After a minute of explaining the situation, the manager removed the chicken (of which my friend and I ate 3 of them) from the bill. Because of my disatisfaction, I paid exactly the $11.26 on the bill... in cash.

Oh, yeah, no one apologized.

If there was a zero star rating I would give this establishment that instead. If you want better chicken, go to B-Dubs or even McDonald&#39;s."

I will be the first one to admit it... I love hooters.  It was one of my favorite places to go to for wings.  Unfortunately, my opinion vastly changed after my last visit there.

Our waitress was great, she was very friendly and on top of things.  The food however, completely disappointed me. Our wings took a very, very long time to come out.  When they did, I was surprised at the small size of them.  They were also lukewarm at best.  I wondered if they had been sitting out for some time before being brought out.  All of the other guests at our table said the same thing.  Our fries we brought out after our wings, and were warm, which was some good news for the dinner.   I do seriously love their blue cheese as well.  

I just felt disappointed at the end of the meal.  I&#39;m not the type to send food back because I feel like its wasteful, so I had 4 of my 10 wings and brought the rest home.  Maybe they&#39;ll be better reheated?  

I&#39;m unsure of whether ill go back to this particular location.  Sorry Schaumburg hooter"

Stephanie had my drinks refilled before I could even ask.  The food was a whole different story.  The chicken nachos I ordered were gross.  The chips were oily, thin and the beans were like canned beans - gross.  My friends chicken Caesar salad barely had any chicken in it and was small.  The wings he ordered were very oily and the oil literally hardened up on the plate making the chicken wings not very appealing.

I still contend their wings are the best going.  That said, they have gone WAY down-hill.  You would think that with all the competition in Schaumburg (particularly direct competitors like Tilted Kilt and Twin Peaks) that Hooters would make an effort to step it up a notch.

First, has anyone notice that their prices have spiked dramatically in the past 5 years or so?  I mean, we&#39;re still talking about fried chicken wings here, right?

Secondly, the portions have gotten smaller and the food seems dried out and warmed over.

Haven&#39;t tried hooters in a while but here was today&#39;s lackluster experience:

Looked up what I wanted on their website and ordered in the car on the way over. 
 
The waitress called me back a few minutes later and said they didn&#39;t have the shrimp and spinach salad (on the website under menu but okay....)

Changed the salad to a Cobb salad.  Calls me back a few minutes later to tell me they didn&#39;t have that item either (another item clearly marked on their menu)

I then asked what types of salads they have.  She listed them and I asked &#34;What is in the Hooters salad?&#34; to which a very confused waitress answered &#34;ummm...a bunch of vegetables...I&#39;m not really sure, I&#39;m new&#34;.   Uhh.....okay.  Fine.

Arrived to pay over $45 for 2 people.  This same order used to cost about $20 about 5 years ago.

I get the meal home to find my philly cheesesteak, once a very good Hooters offering, skimpy and dried out.  It used to come with an au jus type sauce in a cup.  Nothing.  Not to mention, not served with garnishes or potato salad like it used to be - just ala carte, and even more pricey.

The &#34;salad&#34; I got LITERALLY didn&#39;t have lettuce.  I couldn&#39;t make this up if I tried.  My wife looked at it confused.  It used to be a very big, fresh looking salad.  I don&#39;t even know what we were looking at.  VERY disappointing.

I ordered a key-lime pie dessert, and of course, received strawberry cheesecake.  

C&#39;mon, Hooters, get your act together.  You were once a happenin&#39; spot with great food that had lines out the door.  

Smaller portions, inaccurate orders and twice what we would pay for Portillo&#39;s down the street, which never disappoints.

It&#39;s disappointing what happened to this chain."

Normally when I visit a location offering a discounted meal I tip based on the price of the meal before the discount.

Hostess sat us down and we waited 10 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge us. I went up to ask the girl who sat us and advise her that nobody has came to the table yet. She was talking to 5 other girls standing around and replied to me that she didn&#39;t know who&#39;s table that was and went back to talking with the other girls. You figure with all the other food choices available they would be a little more attentive and care about the customers other than what happened the night before.

I am ashamed to admit that until yesterday, I had never been in a Hooters. I guess I thought it was something that it wasn&#39;t. I&#39;m sorry, I was wrong. It&#39;s actually a decent restaurant and while the waitstaff are wearing shorts and tops that show their &#34;assets&#34;, it&#39;s not obscene unless you prefer your women in burkhas. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s quite a &#34;family&#34; restaurant, but the waitresses do make a big deal with the kids. Maternal instinct?

The boneless wings were excellent and the &#34;hot&#34; level of spice wasn&#39;t really that spicy. I really enjoyed the curly fries and the large Blue Moon beer was great. I&#39;d prefer they offer a few non-mainstream beers or a local microbrew, but they don&#39;t seem to go in that direction.

They have a ton of TV&#39;s tuned into the current sports events, but they&#39;re all muted. Instead, you get random songs from assorted artists.

Parking for this location is a bit of a pain. You can ONLY park in the Hooters lot. Don&#39;t try parking in the office lot or the neighboring restaurant. There are a ton of signs warning that they will tow you.

Bonus: Free wi-fi!"

However I have to deduct 1 star.  We went in on Sunday for lunch.  I decided, after debating for several visits now, to try their boneless wings.  Big mistake.  I was so disappointed with these.  They were like small chunks of chicken dusted with breading and the sauce just waved over them...and dry as hell.  Plus they come out on this tiny dish.  They really could have just been an appetizer.  I will never get those again."

My husband and I came to this location for dinner. When we set down we waited forever for our water to arrive. Then once our meals came out everything went downhill. I ordered boneless wings with fries. My wings were supposed to be median with a side of hot. I am not sure what I got but it was nasty. They were the side of if not smaller than mcnuggets. They had no sauce on them. The hot sauce that came on the side was grainy and oily. When asked about the sauce, the waitress said that it was supposed to be like that. When I bit into the wings, they were cold. I didn&#39;t have them take it back bc I don&#39;t want to risk anything. So I just ate most of them.

The only reason we wanted to go to hooters was because the one we would always go when we lived in San Diego was so much nicer and better quality.  I&#39;m so grossed out. Never again."

Well if it&#39;s in the breading, then their recipe has changed because I used to taste the sauce in their wings. When I told my waitress that my wings had no sauce, she started giving me attitude about it and how next time to ask for &#34;double-dipped&#34;. How do you double zero sauce? 2x0=0 my friend. On top of all that... If my wings already had sauce then why did I taste a noticeable difference when using the sauce? I used to actually like Hooters.

We have had some of strangest service issues here with the pretty ladies missing items, doing strange things to our bill, forgetting drinks, it seems there is always some kind of service issue. However, it&#39;s hot girls serving you so I think you let them get away with a lot that wouldn&#39;t be acceptable anywhere else. They definitely have an A Squad and a B Squad. Sadly for us, it&#39;s usually the B squad during lunch with a couple A teammates which I imagine to be rookies. 

I have tried some different things here like the hot dog which isn&#39;t anything too special and the chicken sandwich to which I had the same reaction. The wings are definitely Hooter&#39;s saving grace! They are quite good I just wish they would deliver! We get wings every Friday from different places and last Friday we picked them up from Hooter&#39;s. Yummy! The mild, boneless are just like chicken nuggets to me...so I loved them!

Although service is meh and the food besides the wings here is meh, I will 100% be back! :P"

The pleasent aspect of the experience was the nice male host at the door, Yes, Hooters employs a few males. I received the order when promised and there is designated parking for take out orders. Also, the tater tots with cheese and bacon bits were pretty good. I would not go there for them but it was something I would have ordered again if I could try again.

It&#39;s sad because I want to like it, but I just can&#39;t. A few years ago, I came in for dinner with my husband a few times. Every time my food was cold before it hit the table. I finally got him to stop going. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago when my newly pregnant neighbor/friend wanted fried pickles. I suggested Smashburger, but she had her heart set on this place. So, we went. I like her a lot and thought things may have improved. We waited about a half hour to be seated. Waiting here is weird. There&#39;s really no where good to stand. I felt like we were staring at people eat no matter which way we looked. Additionally, it&#39;s cramped and waitresses kept bumping into us. 

Once seated, we chose a wide variety of items. Apps, entrees, drinks, etc. The wings were good. Thus the two stars. I ordered Buffalo Shrimp as my entree and guess what?  They were cold when placed in front of me!  I sent them back and by the time the replacements arrived, everyone else was done eating. At least they were hot. I had a few since shrimp do not reheat well. It was a major disappointment. 

Here&#39;s my other problem. When the check came, my mouth fell open to the floor. They seriously nickel and dime you to death!!!  The waitress implied that things like ranch or blue cheese dressing were included. Like it was choose one or the other to go with your meal. Then, she would say things like &#34;do you want two of those?&#34;. Never giving the impression that this was a way to pad the bill. Needless to say the check was unbelievable and I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the whole cold food thing. I can&#39;t imagine I will get talked into going back again anytime soon."

It was a Sunday afternoon, and while all the tables were full, the bar was wide open. I sat down and waited.....and waited.....and waited. The bartender was far too worried about checking her phone and looking at the split ends of her long hair. Look, I know I&#39;m a girl and not exactly Hooters desired clientele... aka a girl with boobs... but I too get hungry. Just as I was about to put my coat on to leave, the bartender comes over and asks for my order rudely.

At this point I should have walked out, but like I said, I was hungry. I ordered what I used to order in the past: a hot buffalo chicken sandwich with blue cheese and a side of curly fries. 

45 minutes later the food came and it was a sad story. The sauce was barely noticeable on the sandwich, I was given ranch, and the fries were cold. I tried to get the bartenders attention to fix it, but she was too concerned with flirting with the guys at the carryout section of the bar.

That being said, I don&#39;t really think their wings are all that. You want wings I say check out Buffalo Joe&#39;s, but then again you don&#39;t have wait staff serving you with their butt cheeks hanging out so it&#39;s a toss up on the food or the ambiance. 

My most recent visit was actually on a busy night, but my cousin, his wife, and their kid were seated at the bar and that was by far the quickest option. The waitress tending to us was very attentive, but it also probably helps to have a super cute nephew to keep her occupied.

I ordered a fish sandwich which was just alright and my husband said his meal was ok. Oddly enough I enjoyed the fried pickles which I thought sounded disgusting, but with their dipping sauce actually was pretty good.

So guys, mostly the ambiance. I&#39;m sure the fried pickles or their wings only holds the small truth as to why one would call this a favorite."

Now I go for the crab legs and 911 boneless wings- they have a special on Wingsday err Wednesday.

I still throw on the Hooter&#39;s Seasoning Salt onto the legs and add about a half bottle of the hot sauce to my bleu cheese for chicken dippin&#39;. 

I dunno, the girls at this location are not as friendly as the one in Downers Grove but they are still very good at what they do.  If I had a choice I&#39;d go to the previous location except my dining partner hates that one so of course I will oblige and go here.

Don&#39;t bother ordering their 911 (hottest available) sauce because it is not much hotter than 3 Mile Island and 10 times saltier. Yeck. Come to think of it, all their food is salty so that you order more beer to wash it down with.

People say hooters is really good for the wings but their wings are just normal nothing out of the bounds.In my opinion their wings lack the proper heat hot wings require but if you don&#39;t want to attack the wings you always have an option of burgers and hot dogs.

Overall the place is not that great for the wings and we have a couple of other good options for the wings in the city."

Living in the NW suburb of Lake in the Hills, we often went to the location in Crystal Lake. Since Hooters closed that location, we make the drive to their Schaumburg location. I have to say that the last couple of times  here we were rather disappointed with our dining experience. Both times our wings and shrimp were served to us in a pool of sauce and were almost cold when we got them. Last night was a completely different experience. It was as if we were back at the old Crystal Lake location. Our wings and shrimp were cooked perfectly and we could tell that they were right out of the fryer. The amount of sauce on both was also perfect. The curly fries were also piping hot when we received them. Whoever was in charge of the quality control did a excellent job last night, I hope that he/she keeps up the good work.I would also like to mention that our waitress Keslie was very friendly and did a phenomenal job making sure we had a great dining experience. I would also like to mention that Hooters now has a decent craft beer list, which tells me that someone at corporate is not missing the boat on the craft beer explosion. I only wish that they add Ballast Point Sculpin to there list or even try to match the beer list at their San Marcos California location. Keep up the good work and we will be coming back here on a more regular basis."

We placed an order for pick up for a Friday night because we figured it would be a madhouse inside. 

The ladies were very nice and after getting over the initial shock of seeing a very pregnant Hooter Girl pass right in front of me upon walking right through the door, I couldn&#39;t help appreciate the retro outfits they still wear. 

I guess I had very high expectations of their wings, so I&#39;m sorry to say I was kinda disappointed. I&#39;m used to sloppy, wet wings drenched in barbecue sauce that I can cut with my Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing. The Buffalo Shrimp was pretty good, but I have to say my favorite thing from their menu were the Tater Tots. 

Apart from the very friendly and accommodating staff and the Tater Tots, I&#39;d have to take a pass on the wings and head over to Buffalo Joe&#39;s or Buffalo Wild Wings instead."

I like dives but this isn&#39;t one, its a manufactured divey environment and seems ridiculous. Their marketing trys to get in front of their image with the tag line &#34;delightfully tacky, yet unrefined&#34;, seemingly accurate.  I anticipated hugely greasy fried food that was poorly made like most chains.

But I was hopeful because I love wings.  I once took a pilgrimage to the Anchor Bar in Buffalo and I like their original style of wings that are not breaded. I have not had a breaded wing that I thought wasn&#39;t a greasy sponge but I know this place is famous for breaded wings so I gave it a shot.

Well I was wrong and I was right. It is a lame chain but they claim the chicken is never frozen. Hmmm. And you can get the wings with or without the breading. 

Truth be told the wings look better and more substantial with the breading. Our group ordered them both ways and the breaded ones looked better visually and held more sauce (and oil) but I still prefer the unbreaded original style. 

Wing fans, Hooters wings are not hot. I listened to the Yelpers who said the &#34;Hot&#34; version were not hot so I ordered the next level hotter which was called the &#34;3 Mile Island&#34;  which were also not hot. 

All in all the wings are light on sauce and heat and are just ok. Our one friend who ordered a chicken sandwich thought it was very unmemorable. The bleu cheese dressing was weak although people liked the Ranch dressing. Our server was very nice and the place was friendly but it is cartoonish, silly and not a serious food contender in almost any way."

The service there isn&#39;t the greatest either. I was picking up takeout once and standing at the counter and the girl looked at me and totally ignored me and kept talking to her coworker. Maybe because I&#39;m not a guy... The place itself is kinda grimmy but it is Hooters...

They&#39;re also great about providing separate checks which makes things easier too.

Usually I get the boneless wings because I love the honey thai chili pepper sauce, but I wasn&#39;t in the mood during my last visit so I tried the fish tacos instead. Wow, they were delicious! Keep in mind this is coming from someone who isn&#39;t too fond of fish other than shrimp. I&#39;m not sure what even possessed me to order them, and I started to worry after I did so, but I didn&#39;t regret it at all once I took my first bite and will probably get them again the next time I&#39;m back.

The description from their menu: 
Marinated, grilled mahi, served in a flour tortilla. Covered with shredded cabbage, cheddar cheese and Hooters secret sauce. Served with pico de gallo and cole slaw.

That secret sauce really makes it and they don&#39;t skimp at all on the fish either."

I wasn&#39;t sure of the sizes because we ordered online and my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach. 

When we arrived our order was ready and waiting. The staff was friendly and helpful as we grabbed our bags, got a few drinks from the soda fountain and packed up to head out.

The meatball sub I got was larger than I expected. That was a nice surprise and probably would have been better for a dinner portion than lunch for me. The meatballs had great flavor and enough sauce to compliment the meatballs. The to-go was a risk because the sauce had enough time to soak in and make the bread a soggy mess. The flavor was good but after a few bites it was easier to eat with a fork than with my hands.

The shining light in the meal and at this store - the homemade parmesan chips! Wow. SOOOOO good! I got a bag and the bag was a generous size. Double the typical chip bag portion. I was so in love with them. They have just enough parmesan on them to add a nice flavor to a super crunchy bite size chip.

Skip the rest of the food and just by these in bulk!!"

I don&#39;t eat a lot of junk, so when I splurge on fries, I want them tasty. 

I was on my way to a show a few weeks ago and was too lazy and pressed for time to cook, so stopped in for a Grilled Chicken Avocado + Pepperjack sandwich ($7+ after tax), sans pepperjack. 

It tasted fine, but a whole 5 minutes later my sammy made an, erm, reappearance. Not good.

I don&#39;t have a delicate stomach and I&#39;m not normally one to complain, but I&#39;m not cool with paying for intestinal distress. I called Buona and spoke with a manager, who apologized, took my name (I gave him my order number too, though he didn&#39;t ask for it), and he told me he was putting my name in the system. Next time, he said, &#34;Come and order a replacement meal, get something for a friend, and tell the cashier to look up your name in the system.&#34;

Look, I&#39;m not one for freebies either. It would be nice of them to replace my one meal. He seemingly offered the second to make up for the experience.

So tonight I went in, did what he said... aaaaand the cashier and store manager were super confused. They explained that&#39;s NOT how things work. They honored it, but it was pretty awkward.

The store manager also started telling me that &#34;The temperature is set to X-degrees to cook the chicken.&#34; (Okay, but I got sick and hadn&#39;t eaten a thing in 5+ hours. The chicken seemed slightly under. Could there also have been cross-contamination?)

The Turkey Classic I had tonight was very good and the fries were actually okay. The best part? No tummy issues this time.

It&#39;s nice Buona was willing to make the situation right, despite a lack of protocol/communication. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d return to THIS location.. if I do, I&#39;ll still avoid anything with chicken."

Items are made to order so it usually takes a few minutes which is totally worth it. 

I typically eat in and noticed several of the employees are high school students. Knowing that makes it easier to accept occasional less than satisfactory visits whether it involve an incorrect order, less than enthusiastic demeanor or playfulness with other colleagues while you wait for your order. I get it. We were all teenagers once. 

Gluten free bread is available for sandwiches and pizzas alike. The pizzas are smaller when ordered on gluten free bread. My bf has an allergy so he orders  the GF pizza despite its size and will typically get something else (soup or salad) too. 

There are several qualities that are unique to this location, i.e.

- offer pizza; many locations do not 

- offer beer and wine 

-  Ghirardelli chocolate brownies with nuts; many locations only have brownies without nuts. 

- plenty of seating 

- $5 pizza Thursdays"

OK, cool!

The interior is cute -- an ice cream counter with bar stools covered in cow print, many signs, good seating, etc. Typical restaurant of its type, yet I was pleasantly surprised. The menu had plenty of options, including a variety of salads. However, most of the non-meat salads were things I make at home regularly, so I ended up ordering the Buona Chopped Salad with a side of french fries. The salad has typical salad toppings along with cool penne pasta -- I thought it sounded good. And it WAS good! And HUGE! I swear this salad had four servings in it -- I didn&#39;t even want the french fries after I saw how large the dish was. I ate half of the salad while I was there and took the other half home -- which was just as good the next morning. The family enjoyed their beef sandwiches.

It was tasty and the portion size was perfect. I am glad we came here. There were a lot of people also at the time. Not sure if it was because of lunch time or not, but I mean if a place is busy that always means a good thing am I right?

A+ for buona beef guys!"

So whenever I head out to Chicago, I make sure to carve out some quality time with one of my heart attack friendly faves: dipped Italian beef giardiniara on the side sweet peppers optional. Buona&#39;s beef is good, quality product, well seasoned, fair pricing, I can order a junior size and au jus on the side and I&#39;m happy as a clam until I start craving another one. My #2 at Buona is their Vendura Misto thin crust pizza, which tastes gourmet and is a quick and easy work lunch. Note to out of towners: if a native Chicagoan tells you otherwise about the beef here (and junk food in general, especially pizza and hot dogs), just know that native Chicagoans are extremely serious and opinionated about their beef, and will likely go on and on about where to go, where not to go, etc. and may defend their opinion to a death match. So what you should do is just nod politely and don&#39;t let them sucker you in to drive to a random hole in the wall an hour away for the &#34;BEST&#34; beef. It takes many years of regular Chicago Italian beef eating to get to the level where you really will drive out of your way, know the difference, and it&#39;ll be worth it."

We ordered the Latin Omelet, and a side of two eggs scrambled with toast. The Omelet was great, according to my dining companion.  However, my eggs were brought out runny.  I guess, I should have ordered them &#34;well done&#34;.  The reason for the two stars, is no one asked how things were.   A food runner dropped off the food, and bus boys kept the coffee filled, and cleared the table.  They even took my eggs which had not been touched, without even asking if I was done.  No waiter or waitress asked how anything was, even when they dropped off the check, it was, &#34;Here&#39;s the check, pay up front.&#34;  So I figured I could comment up front on the eggs.  Well, up front, they took my credit card without a word, and ran the bill, and presented the slip to me to sign.  No words, no nothing.  Was not interested in what I had to say.  So, sadly, the servers received a minor tip, but they probably don&#39;t even realize.  

And they were not all that busy, but apparently everyone was having a bad day."

Our server was friendly, in a standard diner sort of way.

We ordered a BLT Club, an OJ &amp; some sort of Chicken Salad in an Avocado.  I had a strong feeling the place wasn&#39;t going to be good so I went with a BLT because that&#39;s almost impossible to screw up.

The soup that came with it almost seemed like it was a gag.  Cream of Chicken with almost all flavorless cream and nothing else, plus it wasn&#39;t even warm.  Nothing like cold cream soup, ha.

The fries on my BLT tasted like they were frozen then baked, not worth eating.  BLT was good and so was the pickle.  

The Chicken Salad would have been better off being listed the British way as Chicken Mayonnaise, because that&#39;s what it was.  Mayonnaise with some chicken in it.  

The OJ was solid.  Definitely the best part of the meal.

We left thinking, &#39;I want my lunch back!&#39;.  But we couldn&#39;t get it back, that time was lost forever.  Damn you Thai people down the street that decided to go on vacation for a month and force us to Elly&#39;s."

I couldn&#39;t believe that the kitchen would send that out or that the server thought that was acceptable. We didn&#39;t have the best server in the world either though. Absolutely no personality and was literally just an order taker...he literally did the bare minimum. 
So I asked him for fresh green pepper and I was actually shocked at the fact he seemed so thrown off by my request.
When we were paying, the owner asked how our experience was, and when I proceeded to tell her about the quality, she was so adamant that everything was freshly prepared that morning. You&#39;ve got to be kidding me....

For 9ish on a weekday, it was pretty quiet. They were only seating folks on one side of the restaurant.  It took a while for us to get our food, which was a bit of a surprise since they weren&#39;t that busy. But so long as the food was good and served hot, I can overlook the sluggishness.  Especially with a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ.  If you&#39;re a fan of OJ, you must try it.  So good. So fresh. Sunshine in a glass!

I asked for the potato pancakes to be served extra crispy and they did it perfectly!  I think the Hollendaise comes from a mix, but it was still good and the eggs perfectly poached. 

Angela P&#39;s omelet looked really good as well and even though it was morning, french fries were available too.  The coffee was a little on the weak side but still unlimited refills and piping hot. A bit more than what I&#39;d pay for breakfast at my usual breakfast joint, but still a nice experience. A great spot for breakfast play dates!"

The food came out fast. I had a patty melt on Udi&#39;s gluten free bread. What a treat to have such a &#34;normal&#34; food but feel safe that it was gluten free. My mom had the GF French Toast and she was in heaven.

I had been to the one on Milwaukee Ave several times. We had the eggs benedict and the dutch apple pancake. I wanted my boyfriend to try the big pancake since we just learned that this is a Chicago thing, and I now live in Boston with him (a native New Englander). 

The server was brutally honest and said that the best apple pancake is at Walker Bros. I appreciate his honesty and he got a good tip, because he was a great server all around. Our pancake was lacking in flavor, too custard-like, and was burnt on one side. A disappointment for trying to show someone an example of a Chicago food item.

The fresh squeezed orange juice is as good as I remember from the other location. The eggs bendict, however, no good. The sauce was grainy and a bit too brown for my liking. Nothing like the eggs benedict I had at the other Elly&#39;s.

This is a big restaurant, with modern decor, and very clean with good servers. The food falls short and it WAY WAY WAY too expensive for bad food. I&#39;ll go to Mr. A&#39;s next time, and skip the big pancake."

I read some of the reviews which were iffy, but I figured it couldn&#39;t be too bad. 

It&#39;s very different than the one on North Ave. I felt like a fish out of water there! The clientele are much different than the other place.

The food wasn&#39;t as good as the north ave location, and the service was slow at first but got better towards the end. The food was still good, but just not as good.

We went on a Saturday after the breakfast rush around noon. It was not that busy. Hostess was a little aloof and not friendly but whatever. We got our sticky syrup covered menus and decided what we wanted to order. Well two bus boys were walking in circles around the restaurant one carrying a pot of coffee the other carrying water. They came by 5 times before our waitress came over. She did and was about our age (mid 20s) so my wife didn&#39;t appreciate being called &#34;honey&#34; but again whatever. Well now we have placed our order. A few minutes later the waitress&#39;s friends come in and sit two tables behind us. She decides to go over and talk to them for a good solid 15 minutes about Marilyn Monroe, tattoos, and rap artists. All in the meantime people are coming in after us, seated, order taken, and getting their food before ours is out. I said to my wife &#34;how long does it take to make an omelette and pancakes? 5 mins right? Especially since they are not busy.&#34;

So we are getting a little perturbed and the chatty waitress must of realized she is still working and decides to check on our food. 5 seconds later she is carrying it out on a tray. Wow is it a coincidence that it just magically got done when she walked back there, or was it sitting in the tray for 10 minutes ready to be served? It turns out to be the latter because our food was COLD. I was hungry and decided to eat the dry omlette and room temperature bacon YUMMY!  But the famous pancakes were too cold to be eaten. I asked her to reheat my hashbrowns and my wife took one bite of her food and sent the whole plate back.

Aside from the terrible and unprofessional service the food wasn&#39;t that great. I dont know maybe if it was hot it would&#39;ve tasted better I doubt it. When we went to the counter to pay I was going to say something to the cold hostess (ha cold food and cold service) but she didn&#39;t even ask how our meal was. Just took our money and said &#34;NEXT!&#34; 

In summary a lot of losses today. Server lost her tip, Elly&#39;s lost future business, and we lost our appetite. Thanks Elly&#39;s in Arlington Heights!"

They were super kid friendly and brought us our 3 high chairs with crayons and coloring paper, which was nice.  We ordered our food, some eggs benedict with a potato pancake instead of an English muffin and I ordered the veggie omelet.  We both enjoyed our food, mine was nothing spectaculour but also it wasn&#39;t bad by any means either.  It was all just okay for me.

I&#39;ve now been here twice.  Both times, I didn&#39;t have to wait.  If you know what I&#39;m like when I&#39;m hungry, that is a VERY good thing.   

It has your typical breakfast food - eggs, benedicts, omlettes, waffles, crepes, and of course pancakes.  There is a sort of family/dinner feel to the place.  They are definitely quick to serve the food (again, another good thing when I&#39;m starving).  Although, I did feel a bit &#34;rushed&#34; both to order and pay. I dislike that.   I&#39;ve had an omlette and pancakes. The omlette was good but missing more fillings for my liking.  I think I prefer the pancakes.  They are good, but nothing that sets them apart.   Another plus is that Elly&#39;s prices are reasonable and they do not skimp on quanities.  I left brunch and knew that it would be a late-dinner kind of night.

All in all, it&#39;s good and I would definitely pick this brunch spot again.  If we could get half stars, this probably gets on 3.5 since nothing spectacular.  It got bumped since it&#39;s one of the better places I&#39;ve found in the burbs."

The restaurant itself was very clean, big and pretty; we were not expecting it to be so big on the inside.  It was very interesting to see that they had their own juicer there..pretty unique for a Greek diner. 

We started with coffee..which was really good! Plus they had flavored cream, yay!  We both made our own skillets with sausage, jalapenos and onions with a side of pancakes.  To our surprise, the food came out really fast... but I wish it hadn&#39;t.  The sausage was good and the vegetables in the skillet tasted fresh. However, both of our hashbrowns were one step up from being completely raw and the skillets were not as much as a &#34;generous portion&#34; as we expected.  Both my sister and I really couldn&#39;t even eat most of the skillet due to the semi-raw potatoes and oil on the bottom of the dish.  The pancakes crumbled apart as we tried to eat them. 

We were impressed with the service though, both the server and the bussers were very quick at filling our water, coffee and tending to dirty plates.  Overall,  the service was very good but the food was sub-par.  We really wanted to like this place, but we were very disappointed with the food."

When I tried to spread the butter, it wouldn&#39;t melt, and I discovered my waffle was cold.  Strike one.  Upon cutting into the waffle, it was still gummy in the middle, and not fully cooked. Strike two.  Service was also horribly slow and never refilled my coffee or our waters.

When generic pasta, the ubiquitous IKEA meatball, or fusion-thingummy seem too much to bear, fear not! The thing to do is to venture off into the Great Unknown down Golf Road and watch along the North side of the road for the little gem of an eatery called Elly&#39;s Pancake House.

Elly&#39;s  is always clean and bright with nary a Peppy-Cheerleader-Disguised-as-Server in sight. (I will bring up the bathrooms here as deserving a special mention for being absolutely clean and neat. No need to rush home and, in a fit of obsessive-compulsive-pique, take a disinfecting shower.)

An added bonus is the cooks, who are apparently equipped with some sort of jet-packs or turbo-chargers and your food arrives so quickly one almost feels cheated of a pleasant ten minutes in which to slurp the excellent coffee and chat of this-and-that. Thankfully, no one seems to expect one to show the same indecent haste and there aren&#39;t any servers/vultures giving one the significant nod towards the door. Enjoy a Belgian Waffle, scrambled eggs and a side of ham in peace. Now with magic coffee cups that refill themselves!

The menu includes all the basic items generally found in &#34;Family-style&#34; restaurants. The best over-all item (if you can call a complete menu an &#34;item&#34;) is Breakfast All Day; a Special for those of the world who squint at the clock at 1:00 pm and call it an early day at the races.

But the best part is that the food really is fantastic.  One feels that a smiling Grandmotherly person is likely to materialize at any moment and ask if one has eaten enough. &#34;Quite Sure? Not even another slice of toast?&#34; Nothing swims in grease, nothing ever arrives less than piping hot, and there&#39;s always extra whipped cream for everyone.

Happy breakfasting!"

WHAT FOLLOWS ARE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS, ADDED 8/18/2014 We are regulars at Elly&#39;s in Arlington Heights as we are in the neighbor... you can find us there generally on a Sunday morning, but there are spontaneous weekdays or even a Saturday occasionally when it is our &#34;go to&#34; place.  Personally I have been switching it up in my choice in ordering.... portion sizes are large and I regularly take home part of my order as a second mean.  We tend to do breakfast rather lunch but the lunch choices are good as well."

Was driving someone home to the city and she suggested Elly&#39;s in the city. I asked how parking was and she said crappy. So I hopped on YELP and found the Arlington Hts location. Sunday morning 10:30 place was full but no waiting. Food was suburb and our server was excellent. Very attentive, food came out in minutes. I will definitely keep Elly&#39;s on my list for breakfast!"

This place has tons of room and speedy service! We all ordered different things and it was all good! The omlettes are huge, fluffy and stuffed with fillings! The crepes were light and delicious. The waffles with black cherry topping was sweet enough to not need syrup, but not so sweet that you need an insulin chaser. The potato eggs benedict was a surprise-instead of english muffins under the poached eggs, you get crispy potato pancakes-my dad loved it(but will be ordering the sauce on the side as there was a bit much of it).  
Their coffee is strong and the cup is never empty-2 things I look for at breakfast. Nothing worse that watered down coffee or needing fireworks to get a waitress to see you need a refill. 
Will defintiely have breakfast/brunch here again! :D"

That said, I appreciate the straightforward service and food. On the days I get breakfast, I have to to have a large glass of their pulpy orange juice. And if I get the Reuben, I have to have the Mystery Chicken Soup. I call it a mystery because you never know what type of pasta will end up in the soup.

My mother had pancakes, and they obliviously had poor quality control in the kitchen. They put the mushed, torn pancake on the bottom trying to conceal the fact that there are no standards for this sub-par restaurant. Our friend had an omelet that when it reached our table, it was cold. She asked it to be taken back. We thought they would make a new one. We were wrong. They threw the old one in a skillet to warm it up, and ended up over cooking it. My chocolate milkshake was more vanilla than anything. Our waitress was so rude. When delivering our meal, she threw the plates down without a care. When speaking, she dismissed us and pretended not to hear, and walked away. Never will I ever return or recommend Elly&#39;s."

Nevertheless, we headed Elly&#39;s-ways this morning.

It&#39;s spacious and bright, with a colorful display of oranges behind the host station.  

The food is solid--I&#39;ve never had a breakfast here that I didn&#39;t like, though there&#39;s not much unique or extraordinary, either.  You&#39;ve got all your bacon, eggs, sausage, pancakes, belgian waffles, crepes, omelets, skillets, eggs Benedict, etc., etc.  Service is friendly and fast, the food is tasty and the coffee is strong.

Today I had the eggs benedict....I couldn&#39;t really see what was going on under the generous pour of Hollandaise sauce, and only about halfway through the meal did i start to think....wait a minute...how many eggs are on here?  There were four.  FOUR perfectly poached delights!  In retrospect, that may have been excessive (my heart&#39;s hurting a little now), but Elly&#39;s is a great value. 

In fact, that&#39;s what really stood out to me today.  Breakfast? Yeah, solid, reliable, yummy--but dollars and cents better than any of its nearby competitors.  At most breakfast/brunch places, it seems difficult to find much for less than $10 a plate any more.  At Elly&#39;s, there were a LOT of choices for generous breakfasts in the $6-$7 range.  It&#39;s like being transported to.....six years ago.  

Egglectic is still my mom&#39;s and my favorite spot for breakfast, but now that I&#39;ve been reminded of why my dad is so into this place--I&#39;ll be happy to return the morning after every holiday meal."

The place is large, but doesn&#39;t give off that &#34;Cafeteria&#34; feel.

I ordered an omelette. It was huge and came with an order of hash browns and 2 thick, fluffy pancakes. I couldn&#39;t quite finish it all and I have a large appetite. The cost was only $7. 

My girlfriend got a combination of some sort. Came with 4 eggs, 2 strips of bacon,  french toast and hash browns. Also was only $7. 

I also recommend the fresh-squeezed orange juice. It is homemade and very refreshing.

The food was high quality and wasn&#39;t &#34;Greasy&#34; like another reviewer suggested. Way better than a Denny&#39;s or Ihop.

Had the french toast instead, it was ok, IHOP still rules in that dept.  I ordered bacon crispy, it looked like it had been sitting for some time and they reheated it. Wasn&#39;t made fresh.  Service was super speedy. We were seated immediately, table was dressed with plates, drinks, flatware right away.  Condiments stocked, our food was served within minutes of ordering.

Don&#39;t drink much coffee, hard to find some that tastes good... trust me, if you like coffee occasionally, you&#39;ll like Elly&#39;s, just be sure to add cream!

I don&#39;t eat whole eggs anymore, so it&#39;s really important that I get a decent egg white omlet someplace, and Elly&#39;s is it!  No matter what kind of omlet I get, I go egg whites only, and it&#39;s fluffy and filling and yummy!

The pancakes are good, but I have to say that I&#39;m not big on the whole compote thing and they don&#39;t cook the fruit into the pancakes, it&#39;s all in the topping, and that&#39;s a little boring for me.  Otherwise, the texture and taste of the pancakes is good.

My family has been going to Elly&#39;s for years. It was our go to place for breakfast in the suburbs. We decided to go ahead and join the crowd for mothers day breakfast. 

The restaurant is a good size, but we knew there would be a sizable wait. They actually kept a list of names and party size and I thought well this won&#39;t be too terrible, there is plenty of room and many tables are finishing up.  To my surprise, and to many others waiting, tables cleared out in the next fifteen minutes, only to sit, empty. The 4, that&#39;s right, FOUR hostesses kept wandering around with menus, but did not seat a single party. This kept up for about 30 minutes. We finally sat an hour after getting to the restuarant. I again thought this will not be bad, we have been here before, the food is good and comes quickly. No problem.

We sat down and ordered drinks, 2 coffees and a diet coke. Coffee of course was out right away.  My mom, now again this is MOTHERS day, my mom had to ask 3 times for her diet coke, and each time the waitress forgot, and each time my mom asked again. It took 20 minutes to get her drink. We ordered our food, and then the wait began.

We started to notice that this was longer than usual. We also noticed that all the tables around us, some that sat before we did, had yet to receive their orders. It was getting to be almost 2 full hours at this place ,waiting. My dad stopped the waitress and said the wait was too long, we would pay for our drinks, and leave. 

Wouldn&#39;t you know it, but then miraculously our food was ready! It was the absolute, most disgusting food I&#39;ve ever been served at a restaurant in my entire life. My brother&#39;s cheeseburger was thrown on his plate, half off the pretzel bun. The top part of the bun was soggy, why was it soggy??? He asked for Swiss cheese, the cheese was already getting crusty, the burger was buried in it, and to be quite honest it looked as if someone threw up on his plate. My parents had ordered an omlette to share, it was not in any better state. The eggs were thrown onto the plate. The has browns were not fully cooked. The toast looked as if it came from another table that didn&#39;t eat it. My egg whites and pancakes looked as if they sat under a heat lamp for the hour we had been waiting. ALL of our plates were covered in what I can only assume is grease. Every single plate. I&#39;m still trying to get it off my hands from yesterday. 

The best part of all this is that the manager, one of the four hostesses not seating people, could not see what the problem was. At all. We refused the food. I looked right at her and said we have been coming here for years. We have never been served this poor quality of food or experienced this poor of service.  She did not charge us for the food.

We were not the only table this happened to, it looked like many families had the same problem. My family and I will no longer take our business there. As owners of a business ourselves, that kind of service and product is embarrassing and we will not patronize a company that thinks that was ok."

This place had good reviews and I wanted pancakes, so I arrive promptly at 1pm for an early breakfast on an off day. Ordered the Corned Beef Hash which comes with eggs, hash browns, and 2 pancakes. Started off with the fresh squeezed OJ, maybe it was just the oranges but it tasted like a big sack of sugar was added to it making it undrinkable. Had to water it down just to finish it off. When the food came, it was cooked the way I asked but that&#39;s the most positive thing I could say. The Hash was obviously straight out of the can, I could&#39;ve done that at home. The eggs were cooked how I like them, but they were just eggs. The Hash Browns were the highlight of the meal and actually very good, but again I didn&#39;t come here expecting this to be the best part of the meal. Considering the fact the name of the establishment has pancake house in it, it was less than memorable. The pancakes were somehow dry even swimming in butter and syrup, also not much taste to them. The good thing I would say is the service is great and it&#39;s nice and clean. Overall, I wasn&#39;t impressed especially since I&#39;ve had way better food closer to home. And this place also isn&#39;t exactly cheap. When I pay over $30 for breakfast for 2 people, the food quality shouldn&#39;t be so mediocre. This place is nothing special, so there&#39;s no reason for me to go out of the way for it again."

I have never been in there until this week. Like others have said... nothing much to it. Kind of dark &amp; dated, but it was clean. I&#39;ve been wanting Chinese for some time - as I am trying to find a rest. as close to the one that I loved when living in North Lake County...

I went in and placed the order, it was ready in about 7 minutes and everything was piping hot.

I ordered a large beef &amp; broccoli and a small sweet &amp; sour chicken (ones my kids will eat.) The B&amp;B was no where near as good as the other place, but was ok-good. Broccoli was still very crunchy (a little undercooked for me,) beef seems to be of good quality, as I did not find any pieces where you&#39;re sitting there &#34;chewing the fat&#34; forever :) It just was not the same flavor of what I remembered.

The S&amp;S Chicken was def. not the same flavor, but the breading was very crisp and it was good - again, just not the same taste. Kind of grew on me as I ate it.

I found it absurd that you could not swap out the white rice for chicken fried rice - and of course, you have to pay extra. I ended up getting a small order. That was really dry or overcooked. There was a good amount of chicken in it, but I had to take the sauce from the B&amp;B and dump it in there in order to eat it. The rice soaked it up really quick.

One thing that I haven&#39;t seem before is that they STAPLED most of the containers shut. If you have children that help you (or steal the food when you walk in the door :) Please be careful! We had one fall into the rice and if I didn&#39;t notice, that could have been a HUGE issue!

All in all, it was okay - I paid just over $20 - seemed a bit expensive, as the same order (with more food) would have been about $14 at the other rest. I would probably go back and order just the S&amp;S chicken, as that comes with the white rice and I can dump a bit of the sauce on that and eat it that way. It becomes too pricey for me having to pay for the chicken fried rice."

I did not have a menu to go off of so I ordered what most Chinese restaurants have...the Mongolian beef. I asked what came with it and was told chicken fried rice. I thought no problem. It will be ready in 10-15 min.

I get back to my office and open it up. I have an abundance of white rice with a small portion of Mongolian beef. The dish itself was not bad, but the quantity was lacking. On top of that there was more white rice under the beef almost to make it look like there was more beef than there actually was. What am I supposed to do with so much white rice?

The eggroll was the usual, a whole cabbage stuffed into a little roll and just ok. I did not see or taste any meat or shrimp in it. Just cabbage. Nothing to write home about.

I would think since this place has been in business for a while, it would be better. Then again this is Wood Dale, so I shouldn&#39;t set my expectations too high."

Won Ton soup is $2.25 and full of noodles and pork and crisp vegetables. Egg rolls are fair. Kind of greasy. Fried rice is tasty and full of chicken and flavor $6.95 and enough for two.

There aren&#39;t many choices in Wood Dale; it&#39;s pretty much this and the China Buffet in Georgetown Square.

I grabbed some takeout on my way home on a rainy day and went with my standards, wonton soup and chicken lo mein.

This place is in a grungy 60s-era strip mall that has not been updated. So please note that there is no real atmosphere and it&#39;s kinda dumpy. In August they still had their Christmas decorations up ... or maybe it was a head start, what do I know?

My order was taken promptly and was ready quickly. And I got a huge amount of food, hey, leftovers!

The wonton soup was piping hot and packed with veggies, shreds of pork and three giant wonton. Mmmm. Hits the spot on a rainy day, even in summer.

The lo mein was light and flavorful (and I got at least 3-4 servings worth) ... the noodles were more of the super-skinny kind I associate with Americanized ramen, as opposed to the thicker spaghetti-style. I requested no mushrooms and spotted none; it had a decent amount of bamboo, sprouts, cabbage, pea pods, celery and more plus of course chicken, lightly seasoned and not drowning in brown sauce.

All things considered, I&#39;m kinda sorry I didn&#39;t check this place out sooner. Despite the not-so-fancy interior they clearly know what they&#39;re doing in the kitchen...

PS They request $10 minimum for credit cards."

A man was leaving with his bag of take-out and his unsolicited advice was &#34;best Chinese food around!&#34;  He was right!

The Mongolian beef is my favorite, no place else has been able to top it.  Lo mein is greasy but in a delicious sort of way.  Tasty crab rangoon with plenty of filling.  Pineapple chicken is just fried sweet and sour chicken with a side of the red sauce, warmed with chunks of pineapple in it.  Sounds weird, but my gosh is it good.  Best egg rolls I&#39;ve ever had, not too much cabbage and very crispy.  Faint peanut butter aftertaste (I hear many places use PB to seal the wrappers) is actually very pleasant.  Reheat pretty well, too.  

They&#39;ve never screwed up my order, are great about adding or holding certain ingredients in their dishes, and there&#39;s always plenty of food for your money.  

The only reason I deducted a star is that their delivery guy couldn&#39;t figure out how to get to our condo, so we&#39;ve always had to pick up.  Maybe they have GPS now...should I try again?"

The place looks like a restaurant from the fifties and not too far off from looking like the one at the very first episode of Sanford and Son. The place is small and the menu pretty much the same where you will find anywhere else. There is no atmosphere here and if you think you need this then you are better off going to Chinatown. However if you want to stay in the hood then this place gets the job done enough.

If it&#39;s the &#34;best in Wood Dale,&#34; that must mean Wood Dale doesn&#39;t have much to offer for Chinese food. Their lo mein is stringy, dry and tasteless.

This has been my go to Chinese take-out place since I&#39;ve been adhering to meatless Fridays.  Their shrimpies are delish.  I enjoy them in the form of egg foo young and fried rice.  Also, for welcome back to meat Saturdays, I usually get their beef chow mein...with the pan fried noodles that are actually real noodles that have been fried in a pan. (you would think that&#39;s not too much to ask, but it&#39;s been hard for me to find...I usually end up with those brown noodles in a bag that people put on their salads)

Despite the atmosphere (none) and in 3 years never having actually seen a customer sitting and eating at the restaurant (literally) they have a steady stream of cars pulling in and out.  It is definitely not some place you walk in and get any warm fuzzy feelings about.  But when I&#39;m looking for a quick supply of food then they fit the need.  Even if I was going to eat out I would bring it home, but the bottom line is the food is decent and the prices are reasonable.  I have probably eaten there on average once a month for 3.5 years and despite its lack of aesthetic appeal the food has always been good, wait time 5-20 minutes, prices reasonable and the order contains what I ordered.  So while I can&#39;t say the food is great, you are getting a decent meal for a good price that has never left me feeling sick and always with plenty of left overs.  So while the food might not really warrant a 4 they are consistent, on time, accurate, and a good value.  In this day and age that isn&#39;t bad.  When I think that the same order I get here for $13.00 cost me $22.00 while living in Bloomington IL I have to say OVERALL it is 4 stars when wanting consistent takeout ready when you are."

Short Review:  Food was &#34;OK&#34;, but value was high.

Longer Review:

I had the Mongolian Beef/Shrimp/Chicken mixture, and it was great.  Spicy and lots of Beef/Shrimp/Chicken alongside the veggies.  On the side I had the potstickers (good) and Crab Rangoon (mediocre).  The latter felt too processed with not enough crab.

My wife had the Orange Chicken (a bit dry but otherwise good, the chicken itself was high quality breast meat) and the Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken (really good).  The latter was quite sweet.

We also had Chicken Fried Rice (a touch dry but otherwise good) and steamed rice (OK).

The best part of the meal was the overall value.  The Crab Rangoon was free and the total bill was $40 even.

We got enough food for three meals for the both of us.  That&#39;s pretty awesome.

Also, the service on pickup was good.  Only about 15 minutes from when I ordered until it was ready."

The place is nice enough inside, so that earns points.
They had one of those painfully annoying &#39;regulars&#39; there. You know, single white guy that feels his patronage is worth king tuts treasure and is loud and obnoxious to the staff. Seriously, belching, talking across the room to other diners, loudly expressing his ignorant political views, the works. No one asked him to at least talk more quietly.

Back to the food.
The crab rangoon was decent, however it was the kind you get at any buffet and was obviously premade, but decent.

Our meats (mongolian beef and orange chicken) were just not that good, but edible. Our fried rice (both of them) literally tasted like cigarette smoke. I have no idea how it happened but it was just awful. Probably just something burnt on the cookingware but really it tasted like cigarette smoke. Have had food left out around smokers and thats the taste. 

I would be willing to go again in the future and hopefully I just had an oddball bad time. 2 stars because I truly believe my experience was a freak accident. A restaurant cant stay around in a small town like this if its that bad. We dont have enough newcomers that try it once to keep a place around."

The Vegan Buffalo wrap, is absolutely delicious; spice level is perfect.

I&#39;ve been here three times now , my latest visit I accidentally forgot to order something Vegan. I got to my seat outside, unwrapped it and realized I messed up (100% my fault). I walked back up to the counter to reorder something Vegan, the Manager Dan notice I had returned back to cash register, and asked if everything was OK. I told him that i made a mistake and ordered the wrong thing. He re-made my order to the Vegan version, and when I tried to pay for it he wouldn&#39;t allow it, stating &#34;These things happen.&#34;
This level of customer service is exponential, I have never felt this &#34;special&#34; (haha) in a long time. Most places (and Managers) of establishments wouldn&#39;t have taken the time to make sure their customer was adequately taken care of. I will be a frequent reoccurring customer just based on this experience .

That&#39;s not a bad thing when you want a vegetarian or at least reasonably healthy option that doesn&#39;t consist of simply adding the words lean or natural to your food options. Protein bar has a wide variety of options and almost everything that  can be made vegan is indicated clearly on the menu.

There are a couple things to watch out for with protein bar, namely that it is crazy expensive for a lunch option Kama only rivaled by options like an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet. If you order their barrito and also get some soup you can expect to be paying around $14. I would consider that not unreasonable downtown, but that&#39;s a lot for Schaumburg.
 
 Where protein bar excels is that the food is not bland. They make curries that are put into some of their foods that have pretty good flavor and/or spice without being an addition of heat,  as opposed to an equivalent of excess ghost peppers."

However, I always give something a try  because why not right? Well I had their BBQ chicken quinoa &#34;barrito&#34; or w/e and it was surprisingly very tasty.  Also not to mention that it is super healthy, I think their barritos are like 500 calories with like 26 grams of protein with  a lot of healthy veggies. Anyways, this is a perfect place to go if you need some good fuel after a work out and dont feel like cooking. I am glad I gave this place a shot!"

Also had their kale smoothie which was really good and you could tell the kale was sure fresh.

What ruined it for me was the music. They had it turned up so loud I could nearly hear the cashier. I got my juices and gtfo of there. It was super unpleasant.

However you prounounce it (hint: &#34;keen-wah&#34; is correct), there&#39;s plenty of it here!

Although I was wary of Protein Bar at first, it&#39;s become one of my semi-favorite nearby-ish spots to go to if I&#39;m feeling like splurging a little bit on portions of delicious quinoa or a veggie juice.

In the few times I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve tried:

- Greenberry Juice
- The Sears Sucker smoothie
- Pesto Quinoa Bowl
- Denver Scramble

DRINKS:

Protein Bar&#39;s smoothies are all fruits and proteins (mixed with choice of milk). I asked for some veggies (spinach) and they had no problem putting it in. However, the smoothie was terrible -- way too watery. Not getting one of those again. 

On the other hand, the raw juices are packed with veggies -- the Greenberry juice is amazing. It was so good, that I went back again a couple days later just to get more.

FOOD:

The Denver Scramble was OK. Not that wonderful. It lacked flavor, and was way too simple for what I paid for it. Yet... the pesto bowl was phenomenal! It was so good, in fact, that I found a recipe and ended up making my own at home. (Oops... probably not good for business if I make it at home instead of going out, but thats how much it impressed me!)

The only problem with all of these foods? They&#39;re not filling. You drop $10-20 on some hit or miss food that doesn&#39;t fill you up. Yes, it&#39;s packed with protein; yes, it&#39;s healthy; yes, it&#39;s yummy; but, you might still find yourself going to the Buger King drive-thru afterwards to grab some fries to fill up the empty space in your stomach.

I stopped in for a smoothie for my son, and the guy who took our order was so low energy, I had to lean in and ask him several times to repeat himself, just during the process of placing one simple order. When he asked me questions that pertain to a regular smoothie rather than a child&#39;s smoothie, I clarified 3 times that I wanted to order from the kids menu. Low and behold, he gives me the total for my order, and has rung up an adult smoothie.

I love their approach to HEALTHY fast food!

They have loads of yummy &amp; very healthy quinoa options and a special &#34;6 mix&#34; that has a super amount of nutritious flavor packed into each meal marked with this.

I have tried both the Chicken Pesto wrap, and the Newport salad, both of which were tasty, and amazingly nutritious!

You won&#39;t find many &#34;empty&#34; calories here! No no no, they are nutrient dense, and GOOD for you!  I love it!

It makes making healthy smart choices easy!

Some choices are a bit spendy, but when you pay for cheapie crap, you get cheapie crap... you want a $1 menu? Yeah it&#39;s going to be filled with horrible processed junk like from other nasty fast food places.  I like knowing the food choices I make here are GOOD for my body, and great healthy choices!

I seriously will be coming back here time &amp; time again, especially for that Newport salad... those apple pieces add a festively yummy &amp; sweet crunch.

Ok. I am craving it now. SO GOOD!

I am so thrilled they brought a Protein Bar to Schaumburg! 

Let&#39;s all start making healthier choices, that don&#39;t sacrifice flavor or nutrients! Feel confident you&#39;re doing your body AND your taste buds good when you come here....

I love everything they are about!

I still remember the first time they invited me (Do I want a protein bar for lunch? Are you all nuts?) but they swore by it - and I realized it&#39;s a restaurant, and my coworkers were not all Mr. Olympia contestants undercover - and tried it out.

Then it opened in Schaumburg, and I was in the area and very excited to try it again. I cook and eat healthy stuff 90% of the time, so I thought this would be a nice way to break up the super-healthy (ha ha) Christmas week.

#1 The menu in-store is different from what is online. I&#39;m picky - and know I&#39;m picky - so I wanted to make this a very quick stop, as someone else was kind enough to drive me there. Studying up on the web version did not help me.
#2 Price / food ratio = huh? You know the jokes about bird food? This was even a joke to me.

Is it pricey? Yes. The portion sizes are moderate, but the offerings are fresh and the ambiance is straight forward. You won&#39;t find crazy creativity here, in the food or decor...and I&#39;m completely fine with that. Some of my favorite eats at Protein Bar include...

Wrigley Peeled Smoothie - deeeelicious 
Chicken chili quinoa bowl - always go for the avocado and Greek yogurt topper!
Baja salad - flavorful with a substantial kick

Contrary to the name, the cuisine at Protein Bar is not especially meat-centric. Sure, the menu items have insane amounts of protein (the super original bar-rito has a whopping 48 grams of it) but it&#39;s from a combination of chicken, quinoa and beans. I found the &#34;bar-rito&#34; to be pretty tasty -- and very filling -- but the yogurt sauce made it extremely watery and difficult to eat without spilling everywhere. The Baja salad was decent but definitely not worth the money, considering I could make one at home. Or customize the same salad at Chipotle..

Overall, kudos to Protein Bar for bringing healthy back to the suburbs. Next time I&#39;m lazy and looking for a non-fast food option for dinner, I&#39;ll definitely be back."

It is very flavorful and I like to add a little sriracha to it to kick up the spice. 

Every time I&#39;ve left the Protein Bar I&#39;ve been satisfyingly full.  On my last adventure here I also ordered the Wrigley Field? smoothie which was awesome-it did have peanut butter in it so you can&#39;t really mess that up!  I was a little dumbfounded when asked all the options for the smoothie so just be prepared to pick different types of protein, milk, and possible &#34;boosts&#34; (boosts cost more $).  

Overall I&#39;ve really enjoyed this and look forward to possibly, someday, ordering something other than the chili."

The smoothies remind me of Jamba Juice. I ordered the Wrigley Peeled (basically tastes like a chocolate covered banana). It was really good, but pretty pricey for the size (almost $5 for a small). My friend ordered the chili, and it was about $7 for a small bowl - yikes!

That being said, if Jamba Juice and Chipotle ever had a baby, Protein Bar would be it. 

Atmosphere
The atmosphere was very casual and fairly typical to any smaller chain restaurant with plenty of seating and open space. It was fairly slow during my visit so the noise level was reasonable and the staff was very friendly when ordering. The lay out was a tad funky but easy to follow. The menu posted on the wall was very easy to follow and informative as nutrition facts were listed next to each item.

Food
I ordered the Red Line protein shake (Strawberry and banana) which wasn&#39;t the greatest tasting. It actually had little flavor which was disappointing. The pricing is fair with most of the shakes. You&#39;re also offered a free boost to any shake/smoothie. You can even chose the &#34;hangover cure&#34; boost for those considering a place to eat the morning after an adventurous night.

I also ordered the Southwest Salad which, had good flavor but could use more of a zest and kick to it. Pricing on the salads are extremely high compared to the rest of the menu. The salads are served in large portions which helps you come to terms with the price you&#39;re paying for it.

Overall
All in all, this is a great place for health conscious people who need a quick meal. In my mind, I classify Protein Bar as a &#34;health conscious chipotle&#34; and will definitely return to try the other items on the menu."

Stopped in here for the first time after realizing this wasn&#39;t just a healthshake hangout, but actually sold real food as well!  The experience was hit and miss with a little more on the negative.

I ordered an original bar-rito along with a small chicken chili.  The burrito was a fairly big disappointment.  It features a blended mix of quinoa, beans, and chicken wrapped in a decent tortilla.  The chicken was shredded and somewhat absent, what was there was a mess of dry, flavorless meat which was combined with even more flavorless &#34;house made seasoned black beans.&#34;  It seems they were flavored with bean, since they certainly didn&#39;t stand out.

The burrito also contains salsa and cheddar cheese, both of which are lost in the dry and tasteless flavors of the bean, meat, quinoa combination dotted with small invasions of cilantro.  I know they&#39;re trying to capture a healthier market, and I can even get passed the leading flavor of the quinoa (which I actually don&#39;t mind) but for god sakes, you have to at least try to season your food with something, and the burrito has quite a list of healthy options like peppers or lime that could have added some actual flavor to the dish.

On the flip side, the chicken chili was surprisingly good.  It pleasantly packed a little more heat than I was expecting and the dry shredded chicken which had so clearly stuck out in the burrito made a much tastier appearance here dressed in its tomato-bound brethren.  The chili was a little on the sweet side, which I don&#39;t prefer, but overall not a bad combination.  

The only real disappointment with the chili was the small &#34;snack&#34; size which,  already in a smaller-than-average container, also comes half full.  I&#39;m assuming this is to save calories? but it feels more like a cop-out.

If you&#39;re looking for vegan/vegetarian where unfortunately many places already don&#39;t go out of their way to provide a correctly tasty meal, this might not be a terrible option, but compared to everything else around for lunch it definitely comes up short on flavor...

And high on price, almost $15 for a small burrito and a half cup of chili does smack a tiny bit of highway robbery."

Seriously even though people are in the service industry doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t have a bad day or come across short sometimes. 

Anyway, Protein bar offers healthy options for people concerned about what they put in their bodies. Not only healthy but tasty too. I love the Spinach pesto chicken quinoa bowl. That paired with a millenium perk gives me all the protein and energy I need. This place is a body builder or any other fitness enthusiasts dream come true. Wish there were more of them around. People have always been super nice to me and service has always been quick.. Give it a try."

I walked in to meet some pals and the first thing I noticed was that fruity juicy smell, like walking into Jamba Juice.  The decor is clean, modern, and  comfortable. They have a nice selection of fresh juices and healthy smoothies. What&#39;s not to like?  The food menu isn&#39;t huge, but it&#39;s fresh and healthy.  I had the Green City Vegan Bar-ito.  Of course it was healthy and so filling.  It was actually enough for two Bar-itos, but I pigged out.  If you&#39;re a junk food junkie this might not be the place for you.

I hate to throw every employee there under the bus but the past two times I have gone I&#39;ve left actually upset. 

The first time I felt stupid was when I walked in at 9:30 am and the music was blasting. All I wanted was a juice. Little did I know they changed their hours... They made me feel SO DUMB and made awful comments. Then tonight I went to get dinner and the one girl had so much attitude the guy behind me even made a comment.

I love the food, which is why I go ALL the time, but this protein bar needs to drop some staff. It makes the company look bad... Just saying."

I was slightly turned off by the negative reviews but decided to give it a shot anyway. I went in three weeks ago for the first time and was instantly greeted by a girl that was sweeping. As I walked up to the counter I was greeted by the cashier and the workers behind the counter. Was I at the right place? 

I went with the Vegan Quinoa Chili and the Comiskey Cocoa shake. Extra points to the cashier for pointing out that the malt powder wasn&#39;t vegan so they customized it for me. 

The chili was slightly bland but the shake was delicious. 

I had a craving for something sweet so I went in two days later at around 11:30AM. It was empty again except for two people in line ahead of me. I guess I beat the lunch rush. Yay! The morning staff was not as welcoming as the evening staff. The cashier acted as if I was bothering him while I placed my order. I asked if they had soy yogurt and he rudely replied no followed by &#34;is that it?&#34; several times while I was still ordering. I don&#39;t know what was that guy&#39;s problem. There was no one behind me in line and they had five employees in the back so it&#39;s not like he had to run back and prepare my meal. 

I might pop in after work again some day  but I won&#39;t ever come back for lunch. There are far more choices in the area to get a quick bite without the sass."

The prices are $6-11 for items. I have been here four times and i have enjoyed salads and quinoa bowls along with their kids menu. 

The good- the wholesome goodness they put into the meals. I love the healthy mixes they have and the location. 

The bad-the kids quesadillas had tomatoes in them-which is not listed on the menu; I think this was a mistake. So of course we had to take them apart and pick out every tomato-DON&#34;t make mistakes with Kids food-okay! The chicken....what chicken. Every time I go there, I barely get 3oz of chicken, where&#39;s the meat! The employees are tired and at time bothered overly tattooed loafs that don&#39;t even keep the dinning area clean. 

Advice, step it up with good customer service and cleanliness, because some of those gorillas from the gym are gonna get roid rage if they can&#39;t find their meat in their meals."

I&#39;ve been there 4 times.  Before today, my issues lied only with the employees - lethargic/bored, have NO CLUE what they&#39;re doing at the registers, and on one visit their internet was down therefore they couldn&#39;t enter the credit on my app, refused to accomodate or suggest an alternative since it was THEIR issue, so I walked out.  Poor management and poor LOCAL customer service.  I wrote in via the website about my disappointing experience and received an extremely nice email back, taking accountability for the issue and addressing every single point I made (instead of a generic, auto-generated email).

So I decided to give it one last shot.  And it will, indeed, be my last - this time because of the food.  I ordered the pesto spinach bowl, and brought it back to work (2 mins away).  It was not even close to warm, with very, very dry chicken.  There really isn&#39;t any sauce - which is fine - but with dry chicken it was tough to swallow.  The 16oz bowl was about 3/4 full, and it cost about $6 (one of the cheapest things on the menu).

Also disappointed because their breakfast looked delicious, but apparently Schaumburg&#39;s hours changed to opening at 11am so they no longer serve breakfast.  Really no reason for me to go back then.

I would give 5 stars for the corporate customer service, but the location and food deserves a 2 at best."

I just went for my second time and it was exactly 8:02pm and I was reading the menu and the girl who was working was EXTREMELY rude. And yelled from across the desk saying &#34;um hi were closed...bye&#34; um can you be more rude?! If your closed, LOCK YOUR DOORS. And they close at 8pm so it was a matter of 2 minutes. And I get it, I work in customer service if your business is closed you want to leave but 2 minutes?!

The food here is great.  If you do not like quinoa, then really a salad is your only other option.  Lucky for me, I love quinoa.  My favorite burrito is the original burrito. The original burrito does not contain lettuce, which is great for my extremely picky boyfriend. The first time I came here, I got the black bean bowl.  It was not what I expected at all but it was still good.  I&#39;m pretty sure they gave me kidney beans instead of black beans, and overall it tasted very similar to chili. The actual chili on the menu is good too, but only as a side.  You will not be full from just having the chili.  A burrito, on the other hand, is very filling.

Lastly, I have only gotten 1 smoothie from this place because it was the first one I tried, and absolutely loved it.  It is called Pier-nut Butter &amp; Jelly.  So delicious!

Overall, I recommend this place to friends who want to eat a bit healthier. The prices are more than Subway or any average lunch place, but I think it&#39;s totally worth it."

I took my wife here as we were excited to have a &#34;healthy&#34; high protein option in the area (note artificial sweeteners are used; Splenda). While waiting in line, the manager was very rude to a customer whose order was not to their liking. They ended up walking out. Not a good first impression.
As I got to the counter, I explained my gluten allergy and asked if malt could be removed from my order. A worker rudely expressed that he would try his best to remove it. I immediately asked for them to remove my order as I would not gamble with possibly gluten/wheat in my shake.
Both the manager and employee came to me after a brief dialogue I expressed how rude they were, not only to me but the customer prior. Manager walked away.

I&#39;m 47 years old and bit of of a foodie, but after a recent health situation I&#39;m super aware how and what I&#39;m eating. I have been on the lookout for place like Protein Bar for last few months and these guys have it all. Tasty, healthy diverse menu items, excellent service, cool staff, reasonable prices, all served up in an upscale contemporary atmosphere. 

I&#39;m glad to see that they are expending because of the increased convenience of finding healthy fast food. At a societal level, obese unhealthy Americans really need something like this and I think Protein Bar is going to find a huge market. Even those who don&#39;t consider themselves health conscious eaters may become converts ounce they they taste the food and try the smoothies, etc. This food for everyone, not just health freaks. Health freaks like Vegans and the Gluten Free set will like it too though because they mark the menu items that comply with their diets.

I was really disappointed.  I ordered the quinoa black bean bowl with kale on the side and a smoothie.  The smoothie was good- but small.  They didn&#39;t put the kale on the side but rather put it in the bowl.  No bid deal but the bowl had almost no kale in it and I swear I have never seen black beans look brown?! I&#39;m used to Native Foods in Chicago where the portions are larger and kale is steamed.

It was snowing and really cold that night so the thought of walking did not have me thrilled. Not a deterrent to try this place though. It was pretty empty when we arrived. Tons of delicious sounding options. Got the buffalo chicken/quinoa bowl. It was really flavorful. Maybe a touch too much pepper. My mom got some kind of pesto bowl (so good!)

I find the theme and the decorations of this restaurant somewhat tacky, but my female companions have generally seemed to like them.  I do like the various cocktail offerings from this restaurant, but their signature draft beer, the Aruba, is so-so.  And, more importantly, their food offerings, including all the appetizers, main entrees, and desserts, are bland and meh to me.  

The services by the staff members usually seem adequate, but sometimes you have to flag down a staff to be noticed and served.  If you like the particular theme of this restaurant, you will not be disappointed much.  And the parking is easy and convenient."

I use to love coming here to dine with my family. So for the 1st time I decided to order take out. I got my regular jerk chicken sandwhich and it had no flavor at all. So I  decided to call and spoke to the manager. He was a complete jerk. I explained to him what was going on and wouldn&#39;t let me speak. 
When he finally stop talking i told him, because of his attitude, i definitely wont be going back to dine in or carry out. 

Very disappointed, i actually loved this place."

But the food itself was very plain. Everything we ordered seem to lack flavor and a lot of it. Even the guacamole I wanted to just pour more salt into it. Everything tasted so plain and lack so much flavoring. Just felt like I was eating the same thing because it was that bland. 

We both got drinks and they both were pretty good but a little on the pricy side. I thought the drink made inside the pineapple was a very cute concept and match well with the theme that was going on. Our waitress was top notch. Before we ordered, we told her we were a bit in a rush and she quickly brought out our food so that there was enough time for us to eat during our 1 hour window for our lunch break. She was even kind enough to bring over the check and some to go boxes because she didn&#39;t want us to wait on her. 

Service good. 
Food not recommend. 
Definitely go during happy hour, much more worth it then paying full price."

I tried the zombie drink (quite tasty) and the sesame crusted ahi for my entree. The dish was very satisfying- I love Ahi tuna- but quite small. We also tried the chocolate island cake, which was way too rich for my taste. Their signature draft beer, the Aruba red was very refreshing after this meal.

The service was pretty bad. We had to continuously flag down our waiter in order to be served. Also, I really don&#39;t like how the calories are displayed next to everything on the menu. Ignorance is bliss! Other than these factors, bahama breeze provides a fun dining experience!"

You feel like you&#39;ve been swept away from Schaumburg to a Carribean Island upon entering. The menu is HUGE, so many food and beverage options it was hard to decide. They have 11 different options for Margaritas alone!

Hibiscus Margarita- this was HUGE just like the menu, came with a pretty edible flower!

Warm Spinach Dip and Chips- probably could have done without this. The dip was pretty liquidy rather than creamy and didn&#39;t have much depth of flavor. Did like that they gave some plantain chips along with the tortilla chips though

Coconut Shrimp Tacos- w/ side of beans and rice and Sriracha aioli, really frickin&#39; good! Makes me crave them writing this review

Jerk Chicken Pasta- yummy but filling, the smaller size was still plenty

Very Enjoyable experience @ Bahama Breeze!"

I REALLY REALLY loved the atmosphere of this place! It is definitely unique. They have a dining area where a person is singing to you live. They have another fancier dining area that has a fire pit in the middle (awesome!). Then they have three other dining areas, each secluded from the other. They have a bar area in the dead center of the restaurant that has three TVs, my friends and I enjoyed catching the ending of the Bulls game. They also have a bar area in the huge dining hall with the singer. I asked one of the waiters if it&#39;s possible to reserve this room and she told me yes (but it wasn&#39;t a confident yes, so maybe she wasn&#39;t sure). Overall, I was very impressed with the ambiance of this restaurant.

We had a table reserved for 25 but only about 18 showed up. They had two separate long tables saved for us, but the 18 of us just managed to squish into one because we didn&#39;t really want to separate. No problems there. 

Now the service. Our server&#39;s name was &#34;Steven G&#34;. He was the best! We were all over the place with our orders and we kept shuffling seats, yet he still managed to bill us all correctly. He was very polite to us and showed no signs of annoyance even though we had many requests. He also made sure to check up on us frequently. Thank you Steven for taking great care of us. 

As for the food, expect to pay $10+ for a meal without any drinks or appetizers. I got the Black bean burger which was pretty descent. I asked to make mine spicy but I didn&#39;t taste a hint of spiciness. My friend requested Jalapenos on his, maybe I should have done that instead of asking for it to be spicy. 

I will be returning"

It seemed to be your usual chain. Food seemed overpriced and the menu was massive (with listed calorie counts that made me stay away from almost everything). The whole place was dead - maybe 5 tables when we arrived at 12:30, but only one when we finally ordered at 1/1:15. And none when we left at 2:10. YES 2:10!

The service was slow from the start. She took a while to get our waters, then took forever to come back when we weren&#39;t sure what to order (massive menu!). When we were ready to order, we also had one latecomer arrive. Instead of getting another chair, she had us move to another table (not a big deal, I assume fire code restrictions or something). Then, we didn&#39;t see her for probably 20 minutes. Two of our people were without drinks. We finally ordered, and did I mention she was rude? I work in IT, with a team mostly made up of Indian people. A guy on my team was having trouble understanding the convoluted menu items and side combinations. She couldn&#39;t understand his accent I guess, and was not shy about it. She finally just said &#34;Yep!&#34; and moved on to the next person, completely not caring that his idea of what sides he ordered was not what he was going to get.

It then took forever to get our food. FO-REV-VER! Like close to 45 mins, and she never came by once during that whole time. The food was actually not bad (it was clear my coconut shrimp plate had been under the heat lamps too long). It was fine, but I was in a rush to get through it and back to the office by our 2:00 meeting. 

She was attentive and nice from the time she gave us our food and got our check. Overall really poor service, and I probably won&#39;t chose it again (mostly because I can&#39;t afford to spend two hours at a restaurant on a work day)."
bahama-breeze-schaumburg,Melissa K.,n1S4QCZFUQUIyde8rHT6Cw,"Indianapolis, IN",1,1,0,30,180,QyKSiwtipSPgr1Tge99nQg,2.0,2015-08-30,"Although I do not live in the Chicago area anymore, anytime I am back visiting my family I enjoy going to Bahama Breeze with them. My parents also go very frequently on their own. The atmosphere is awesome! It really makes you feel like you are on vacation. The food is also normally very good! However, this place has unfortunately gone down hill.

Tonight I visited with my parents. My dad and I both ordered mojitos. Mine (coconut) was very good, but my dad&#39;s (regular mojito) was odd tasting. It seemed like there wasn&#39;t sugar added, and almost tasted like Sprite or something very citrusy/acidic was added instead. My dad dealt with it and said it was fine, but it wasn&#39;t very pleasant tasting.

We started with the firecracker shrimp. Tasty. Decent size.

 I was disappointed to see the menu had changed and that the salmon pasta was no longer on the menu. I ordered the jerk chicken pasta instead, as I had had it a couple of times before and loved it. When I got the pasta it had plentiful chicken, but the taste of everything in the dish was just bland and not very good.  The pasta was a bit dry and the sauce was more watery than usual. 

However, my biggest gripe was that the dish was supposed to have mushroom and asparagus in it and it literally had like 6 chunks of each. By chunks I mean tiny bits less than an inch big! That&#39;s absolutely ridiculous! When I first started eating it I hadn&#39;t realized there wasn&#39;t really anything in it until I came across a piece of tiny asparagus and I thought it was maybe a mistake. Then I realized it was *supposed* to have both mushrooms and asparagus. What a rip off! Not to mention the taste overall was not up to their normal standards. I mentioned this to our server who was very apologetic and said she would tell the manager. 

It took forever for the manager to come over, and when she did she didn&#39;t even seem very concerned or apologetic. I feel like she tried to place the blame on me, like I had faked it or something, because she said, &#34;If you had told us sooner we would have fixed it for you.&#34; How about you tell your chefs to make the meals correctly instead? I was offered another meal or a  dessert, but I declined and just had it compted. Based on the fact it looked like the pasta had been slapped together and the chef probably doesn&#39;t care, I felt like it&#39;d be the type of place where your food would get spat into if you got replacement food. 

Our server was so sympathetic and apologetic, but the service was so slow! The place wasn&#39;t even crowded. My parents also said their food was disappointing compared to usual (and like I said, my family frequents this place!). It was just a bad experience overall. I&#39;m really sad, because this place was always a great dinner choice. I&#39;m so upset that the new management apparently doesn&#39;t care about good service or food. Giving no reason to customers for an obvious mistake in meal prep and having a lackadaisical attitude is a sure way to lose customers."

The food was pretty good as well. The spinach artichoke dip was great! Served with chips and dried bananas (which were surprised delicious). I had the tilipia fish tacos... not my favorite but the first time I&#39;ve tried fish tacos. I would go back and just order something else. My friend ordered some type of seafood pasta. Very large portion.

Especially in the summer months, when you can sit out on the enclosed patio to eat and truly feel as if you were in the tropics. All the open windows let the breeze come from outside. Food menu is outstanding with so many different options to choose from with the Caribbean-Jamaican flare. Cocktails are to die for. I truly feel that I am in the Caribbean when I drink the fantastic drinks. The steel drum musicians are fantastic and add to the ambience. If you want to go to the Caribbean, but can&#39;t get away go to Bahama Breeze for the evening. You won&#39;t be disappointed. A very relaxing atmosphere.

First off, could they be any cheaper with the air conditioning? It was so uncomfortably warm and stuffy inside that I had trouble enjoying myself, and that&#39;s saying a lot because I&#39;m the type of person who finds most places far too cold in the summer. 

Secondly, the food isn&#39;t all that for the price. $10 for 5 not that tasty coconut shrimp,and $17 for two chicken breasts with broccoli and sweet potatoes. And they don&#39;t even bother adding the plantains to the potatoes like they used to either. What a disappointment.

I&#39;m just happy we had a gift card and didn&#39;t spend any actual money here. I&#39;ll take what&#39;s left on the card and go to a different Darden restaurant.

The beer menu was confusing and not priced. The food was OK I guess. Sort of bland. Seems for the guacamole, all they did was squeeze out the avocado and served it. No seasoning at all. Their menu was limited and pricey. Portions were rather small. Drinks were served in smaller glasses. The service was mediocre. Many times we had to flag down our waitress for refills while leaving our table uncleared. Later, our waitress was not to be found so we asked another waitress to please clear our table which she did not. She probably figured it was not her table. 

Oh, the suggested gratuity amount on my receipt was wrong. They included the tax when the gratuity was tabulated. Sneaky. Expanded conversation:

We sat at the bar, and ordered some delicious mixed drinks, along with the Lobster/shrimp quesadillas and an order of nachos.
     The food was great, and pretty filling as far as appetizers go.  The drinks were both very good, and extremely tasty, both ordered off the happy hour menu.  The only downside was that they were relatively light on the alcohol.  This was okay however, since we weren&#39;t exactly trying to get drunk.

Moving chairs around, making noise, crawling under tables, and furiously sweeping for no apparent immediate need. When I asked her to stop, she snapped back that she wasn&#39;t doing it near us ( 3 feet away), and that she wanted the place to be clean for the next person.   
How about us, I thought. Ruin our meal for the benefit of the next customer. Poor judgement and selfish on her part, assuming she just wanted to get her chores done early so she could leave at the end of her shift.

Because of her behavior, the meal (which was delicious) became a negative experience. That girl should not be working with the public.

My friend&#39;s meal was wrong, so she had to sit and wait for hers while I ate.  The waitress should have at least comp&#39;ed her drink for that error.

My boyfriend and I have been here once before and we had a great experience, but it seems like expecting it to happen again was unrealistic.

As soon as we walked in we saw 3 hosts standing there talking, not a single one looked up or greeted us. They just stood there talking; and me being someone that works in a restaurant I found that VERY unprofessional, we did not feel welcome. We stood in front of them for a bit until one finally looked up and just stared. We asked for a table on the patio and she said she didn&#39;t have one even though it was practically empty, like she just didn&#39;t want to walk over there.

My next put off was when I went to the ladies room. Two young servers were standing there talking loudly and complaining about how they didn&#39;t want to be there and just wanted to go home and even some in restaurant drama. IN FRONT OF MANY CUSTOMERS! Swearing and all of that. How unprofessional and rude?!

Next came our server. We saw him maybe 3 times the whole night. He kept walking around and talking to other servers in front of customers. I wish we remembered his name, he said he&#39;d been there for 10 years but it sure felt like only 10 days. I felt like we weren&#39;t welcomed or wanted.

On our way out after being very disappointed with our food, (we would&#39;ve sent it back if our server actually came to check on us other than to bring us our bill) we walked past an entire row of servers leaning back and talking and standing in the small walkway by the porch bar. We had to say &#34;excuse me&#34; for them to even realize we were there trying to leave because they were too busy socializing! Out of the 6 or 7 servers standing there that we walked through, including our own, not a single one said goodbye or thank you for coming in or anything!! I couldn&#39;t imagine not greeting a customer on their way in or out at my restaurant! It&#39;s so unprofessional and very off putting.

Bahama breeze please make some changes because after this experience I will never be returning ever again."

However, I was less that blown away by Bahama Breeze.  The service was very choppy.  Staff seemed confused and kind of all over the place.  We had a relatively large group of 8 and the place was only about half full.  

The ambiance is nice, it really has been well put together and feels like you should walk out the door into a 80 degree night.  The restaurant is large and spaced out which I like.  I ordered a Mango Jalapeno Mohito and it was the highlight of my experience. A+  i would definitely return for another one (5) of those!!!

We ordered edemame (I know, Japanese food at Caribbean restaurant... kinda weird).  They were fine, but we had to ask three different people for soy sauce and the first two adamantly denied that they even carried it... 

I ordered the Mahi with Shimp in Lemongrass sauce (D).  It sounded frigging amaze-balls and I was pumped to try it....   Then I did.   It was bland and tasted primarily of vegetable.  The fish was cooked fine, but the entree just didn&#39;t jive well. 

Overall it was just kind of a &#34;Meh&#34; experience.  And it didn&#39;t help that two smoke birds were puffing away immediately outside the front door and the smoke was permeating the front of the restaurant.   Puke."

The rice was okay, I&#39;m sure it would have been better if it were hot, it was luke warm when I started eating and cold when I finished.

Due to &#34;computer problems&#34;, our 14 orders were in limbo for well over an hour at a time the restaurant was mostly empty. When half the dishes came out, some were missing and some of my co-workers had to put in all new orders (after waiting for 75 min!). Even the most basic things went awry: at one point, I had to wait 10 min for a simple beer bottle, then wait 5 more min for a glass. Running the credit cards took about 20 min. The restaurant clearly has logistical issues and the wait staff and the kitchen don&#39;t communicate. The 14 of us had to pay the price by spending over 2 hours with the ladies who lunch and missing our afternoon team meeting."

I&#39;ve driven past it so many times and used to mock their sign since it looked so out of place in the burbs..but look who&#39;s laughing now!  The décor and ambiance of Bahama Breeze makes you feel like you&#39;re on an island far far away from suburbia.  I&#39;ve been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed.  

My favorite dishes are the rice bowls (Carnitas and chipotle beef) and every time I come, I tell myself I&#39;m going to try something new but I somehow am swayed back to the rice bowls.  I wish they weren&#39;t so gosh darn good!  I&#39;ve also tried their jumbo lump crab stack and the chicken tostones, both of which are equally tasty.  I love the crab stack since it&#39;s basically a pile of crab, avocado and tomatoes and the chicken tostones are the bomb.  I mean, how can they go wrong with chicken, plantains, and cheese??  As for their drinks, I&#39;ve only tried their mojitos and pina colada but all of their drinks sound delicious.  They also have a great happy hour Mon-Fri 4-6pm as well as Sun-Thurs 9pm-close and during these times appetizers are half off!"

We caught the last 6 mins to order happy hour appetizers for HALF off! We got rocket shrimp and half order of Jamaican wings. They were good!!

We got seafood chowder and salmon salad and sautéed tilapia. They brought the salad out after I got my salad and after I notified the server, she felt sorry and took it off our check. We were happy about what we got.

I also got the Bahama margarita and it was colorful. Not strong on rum but it&#39;s fruity tasty."

The motif, the menu and background music are all Caribbean influenced. The many menu offerings are creative and interesting.

The lobster/shrimp quesadillas were great, with chunks of the seafood falling out. A cup of sour cream and one of delicious tomato salsa made the 8 sandwich-size slices into flavors you can suit to your taste. Chicken quesadillas were good too. Nice starter for two or three, or a meal for one.

They offer several &#34;bowls&#34;, which are large one-bowl dinners. The Trinidad chicken bowl had a jerk-chickpea sauce with many large chicken chunks on a bed of rice, with a chutney sauce on top. What a neat idea. Every fork-full had a different flavor: plain, curry, jerk, sweet, and sweet-sour. The mahi shrimp bowl was very good too. On the specials, there was a goat-meat bowl with an interesting sauce; very good. This also had lots of meat. Bowl spices are not overwhelming.

Ribs came black, overcooked and dry, with fries that were so so. The slaw was wimpy and tasteless. My HH margarita was large, pricey, &amp; plain, but I don&#39;t know if it had any alcohol at all. Expensive colored water. Take a pass on these.

The place is noisy; very very noisy when crowded. They play mostly lively Caribbean style music with a Calypso theme. Service was personable and there was ample staff."

Came here last weekend with my girlfriend and her family to celebrate her dad&#39;s birthday because he had wanted to come here for the longest time. We had all heard high remarks about this place, thus our expectations were high going in. Upon setting foot in the restaurant, you really are transported to an island paradise. The colorful walls, tiki hut style interior, island music and even smell transport you to a totally different world. We were seated and greeted by Ashli, who was extremely personable and friendly, so that was a huge plus right off the bat! We placed our drink orders and waited about 10 minutes for those to arrive. My coconut mojito was absolute heaven! I typically like my mojitos prepared classic style but I decided to venture outside of my comfort zone a little bit and I am super happy I did. My girlfriend ordered some fancy drink served in a pineapple which looked yummy, her mom a pina colada with strawberry swirl which also looked good, and her dad, a pain killer which looked the least exciting out of all of ours. Everyone was pleased with the taste of their drinks, so we all thought that was a good sign.

Following our drinks, our appetizers came out. This is where the nightmare began. We ordered their beef empanadas and onion rings, and both were just flat out bad. The onion rings had absolutely zero flavor, as though somebody had not seasoned the batter at all. The empanadas were stuffed with very low grade, almost mystery meat quality cubed beef and a nasty curry sauce that just had an off taste to it. There was nothing remotely authentic about it, and it seemed like whoever created the dish had no palate whatsoever. Extremely dissappointing.

The one thing that ended up bothering us was how quickly they brought out our food following serving us our appetizers. I understand they were trying to provide fast, efficient service but this was pushing it. We ended up needing to ask for boxes for our remaining appetizers, about half of which were unfinished because there was just no more room at the table with how much they brought out.

I ordered the key west shrimp and grits, and it wasn&#39;t all that good. The food itself was bland, and the only redeemable quality about the dish was the cheesy grits which was considered as a side. You know there&#39;s a huge problem when the redeeming quality of a dish is not the protein itself. The shrimp were just not all that fresh, soaked in a weird lemon butter sauce and the green beans were completely bland, as though they had been cooked in water that had not been salted. None of the flavors went together all that well. My fellow dining companions just barely picked at their food, noting the lack of quality and flavor. As it turns out, I was right about the freshness of the shrimp since I got sick and threw up later that night.

All in all, we walked away paying 220 dollars with tax and tip for a 4 person dinner, which seemed like an astronomical price given the quality of food we were served. Had the food been of a higher quality, the price would have been justified, but it simply wasn&#39;t. It was disgusting and we don&#39;t see ourselves coming back, unless it&#39;s for drinks."

Not only were my fiance and I ignored as we walked in the door then we had to experience the unprofessional attitudes and habits of the staff (and good thing we did!) 

It took the bartender almost ten minutes to realize we were there. Then we had to ask to have drinks and menus given to us! As if we would just go away after a while! Then after ordering we watched several employees standing openly on their phones......customer services means nothing right? 

Then to top it all off we saw employees trying drinks! Mind you I have done this in my career but with a straw and hygienic means! This employee dipped their finger into the frozen drink not once but twice! Then a second employee did the same thing! Sad thing is the bartender watched all of this and wondered why I wouldnt finish the drink I was made.....

Then we were pushed out because we were enjoying our time out (which rarely ever happens with our schedules) but the bartender had already closed up so we &#34;needed to go&#34; as we spotted an employee eating off a  guest&#39;s plate.

Needless to say unless you want to go to a restaurant where the staff tries your food and drinks before you I would never step foot in this establishment again!

Oh and FYI we asked to speak to a manager and one didn&#39;t come out until we were through the doors! But had time to say hi to his girlfriend that came in twenty minutes beforehand."

I had the lobster and shrimp linguine as my entree (make sure to ask for extra sauce otherwise the dish is a little dry) there used to be a time when they put chunks of lobster in this dish but because they were giving away the cow when they were only selling milk they now only put in pieces of the claw and I mean &#34;pieces&#34; so that&#39;s something to be aware of.

Those words were spoken by my BFF who actually introduced me to Bahama Breeze a few years ago. 

Bahama Breeze is like a tropical vacation in the suburbs of Schaumburg (where literally every restaurant known to man exists). When you walk in you feel like you are in the balmy tropics- there are palm trees, a huge fire pit, and even live music playing Bob Marley. The only thing missing are tropical birds, a waterfall, and hot shirtless Island men haha

The food is all &#34;tropic&#34; themed and range from coconut shrimp to truffle yuca fries to meats that are garnished in mangoes, pineapples and other tropical fruits. I had the West Indies curry dish and it was sweeter than most curries but tasty nonetheless. My friend had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pasta and loved it!
Dessert was amazing- we had the Banana Supreme which is banana-nut bread with brandy sauce a la mode- perfection!

Our sever was fantastic! I think his name was Steven... He actually drew  island scenes on our to-go containers (complete with bird/sharks) and we got to take home our own unique works of art! The water was constantly filled and I even ordered a mango milk shake which is a unique twist on a classic malt!

The bathrooms are pretty big and the stalls remind you of being in the tropics- however the hooks are kind of high up (&#34;who do they think we are, giants?&#34;- My BFF who is 5&#39;3&#34;). There are several areas to dine in (near the fire pit), (inside under this wooden tent), and (in the center of the restaurant). 

Minus one star because it was kind of dark, we didn&#39;t get to sit at a booth, and there was a long wait where the host didn&#39;t really smile-maybe he dropped his pina colada!"

Always crowded during meal times, so I suppose that&#39;s s good sign. Today, I started with a margarita flight. It came with 3 mini margaritas: grilled pineapple, hibiscus, and key lime pie. The grilled pineapple tasted like butane. The key lime pie was the only excellent one, it tasted like desert. Our waiter was fleetingly available. To start off with, we got the chicken quesadillas. Pretty good way to start off. It comes with pico de gallo and sour cream. For dinner, I ordered the Cuban sandwich and Bahaminian seafood chowder. Both were delicious. The Cuban sandwich is a mix of meat, cheese, and pickles. It always tastes a little better with mustard. I loved every bite of the soup. My spouse got some type of salad covered with fruit. It was very fresh. The manager came by to ask us if our food was okay but started walking away before he could have even heard us reply. The place can be a little pricey, it cost $50 for one drink flight, one app, one salad, and one sandwich with a side of soup. The music was good.

Well it took 45 mins for the manager to come out and tell them that they&#39;re computer were down. Finally after 1:15 hours after placing our order, they came out with half the dishes. My unfortunate luck didn&#39;t. They didn&#39;t bring my dish to about 1.5 hours later. Once my coworkers finished they&#39;re dish, I received mine. The plate it self was very hot, made me realize they just had put my order in minutes before. I ordered the jerk chicken pasta, it was plain taste, definitely not worth $17. I told our waiters the food was not what I expected. She said I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t it? The manager came back apologizing and gave everyone 25% off. Overall, definitely not coming back and DEFINITELY NOT recommending this place!"

I love their burgers, the tuna appetizer is really good, and the grilled salmon was nice and fresh, 

I&#39;m not a fan of their signature beer, I thought it smelled and tested gross, but I&#39;m a beer snob. My husband enjoyed it though, he compared it to Killian&#39;s. 

Great spot for lunch."

Our server (Andrew I think) came over and greeted us very quickly, we ordered something from the bar right away, but our drinks took almost 10 minutes and were half melted when we got them. 
Our server had a big party of 10-12 people, and I, being a server, kind of tried to say he was just busier with them. Big parties can be a lot to handle at times and I understand that. 
It took him about 20 minutes after our melted drinks to even come ask if we were ready to order. The table that got seated a few minutes after us had already gotten their food. We placed our order and hoped it wouldn&#39;t be too much longer. We were starving and just wanted to eat! After another 30-40 minutes our food finally came out, after the party who&#39;s order he took after ours. 
Food was alright, I had the coconut shrimp tacos and my friend had the Caribbean pulled pork, but nothing special. 
2 star food with 5 star service, I&#39;m willing to try again. 5 star food with 2 star service, I&#39;m also willing to try again. But when everything is overall just mediocre it&#39;s hard to want to give it another shot."

Although the Olive Garden is the closest of their brands to us, we decided to try this place and take a little road trip to the suburbs.

Upon arriving, the place looked packed.  We had called ahead of time to see if they took reservations-which we learned, they don&#39;t.  However, on the phone, the host said he could put our name on a list and reduce our wait.  So when we checked in, the host said it&#39;d be a half-hour wait, and he gave us that little pager thing.  Then we headed to the bar for some of those really delicious-looking fancy cocktails.  Had some of those, they were fine.  But then we waited, and waited, and waited for our table.  About an hour and a half later--success!  We could finally sit down.

Our meals were good, nothing to write home about.  My meal came out a little lukewarm, so that was interesting.  But the most interesting part?  I almost swallowed a chunk of broken off spatula that had somehow made its way into my food.  The waiter profusely apologized, as it was clearly an accident.  These things sometimes happen.  I wasn&#39;t too upset, and it was OK.  But, eh, this experience is what you&#39;d get at a typical chain restaurant."

I live the atmosphere and the vibe. The food is great. I had the clam chowder which was amazing. My girlfriend had some sort of pasta seafood. She had it for two years in a row. She loves it as well. The seating can be so so. Last year we sat next to the for pit. That was really cool being in the patio by the fire pit in mid winter. This year they sat us next to the kitchen. So if u are making reservations, please ask to be seated next to the fire pit. It&#39;s a whole lot better and romantic. Service is amazing as well. I only gave it four stars instead of five because it is a bit overpriced. I bought an 8 dollar drink that was not worth it. However they do have a huge selection of alcohol.

We went on a Saturday night, last night...and it was packed! That&#39;s always a good thing. This is the most packed I&#39;ve seen a restaurant. We had a half an hour wait and the person gave us a buzzer when it would be our turn. So we headed to the bar when we saw a seat empty to go grab a drink while we waited. It took about ten mins to wait for the bad seat to get empty etc. it was so hectic behind the bar! They were running around everywhere and making people&#39;s drinks. We waited about ten mins before the guy got our drink order. The bar area seemed very congested or less people should&#39;ve been there. You could also grab a seat at the bar and eat there if you didn&#39;t want to wait for a table. So then it was also congested because people bringing out food to people who were sitting at the bar. So that&#39;s that. Drink menu was great! It went with the Bahama breeze name and atmosphere. My husband was saying he wished there were surf boards and stuff there to set that island atmosphere. Anyway, we got our table after half hour and we got seated right in front of the live singer in the second part of the restaurant! Definitely put us back into the island mood. We ordered the coconut shrimp for appetizer which was great. Shrimp was meaty and big. I ordered the shrimp and crab linguine for my entree. Where the seafood aspect was good but for $20 I would expect to have some flavor in my food. Anything salt, seasoning SOMETHING! It was creamy but literally had no taste. I think I make better pasta at home. We will come back eventually and I shall order something different. Be cautious of what you order so it&#39;s not a waste!"

Instantly we were greeted by the manager and seated by the host. Our waiter Ricky was extremely friendly, upbeat, and personable; basically he had all the qualities of a great waiter. He suggested the Rum runner for a drink and the jerk chicken pasta for my fiancé. I had the seafood paella. Everything was tasty and came out so fast. Ricky was very on top of things.

However, the real star of the show is the chocolate pineapple upside down cake. We never usually make it to dessert, but I am so glad we did. It was moist and not to chocolatey. Just a perfect combination of sweet.

I got the coconut shrimp and my fiance got one of the burgers. The coconut shrimp did not taste good at all and the brocolli and rice that came with it had absolutely no flavor in it at all. I saw the girls sitting at my table pick at their food. Most of them ate most of the shrimp because of hunger and did not touch anything else. I had a bite of the burger that was supposed to be cooked medium well but there was pink in it and it was pretty tasteless.

The food was good enough to match its price.  Not the best of ever had but definitely worth the price.  We had the coconut shrimp for an appetizer and it was awesome!

It was a Saturday late afternoon, a warm and breezy fall day in Schaumburg.  We were seated right away and had a wonderful server.  She was quite friendly and attentive.

I love Cuban sandwiches.  When I saw they had one on their new menu, I was sold. We started out with the white bean hummus with fresh vegetables.  My son had the Seafood Paella, my wife and daughter had salads.

First off, the hummus was pretty disappointing.  If you ever had a night in college when you drank beer and had Lays Bean Dip with chips, that was what the hummus tasted like.  Definitely and dish not to order in the future.

The Cuban Sandwich was okay - certainly not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but certainly not the worst either.  The beans and rice I ordered with it were excellent however,  They serve black beans and a yellow rice. Very fresh and tasty and just a little spicy.

Everyone else raved about their meals.  There was a grilled chicken and a grille salmon salad, both were excellent.  The paella was also quite good.

So, overall it was okay.  Bahama Breeze is great for two things - warm days when they open the windows and a you get a nice warm breeze through the restaurant, and those cold days when the windows are shut but you are lucky enough to get a seat on the patio where they have a warm fireplace and live music.

So, stay away from the hummus and you&#39;ll enjoy your experience."

I sat with friends where live music was being played. The performer (Kenny Kipp) was very good, covering songs from Train to Stephen Bishop, switching up from keyboards, guitar and his trusty uke. Good stuff.

I ordered the shrimp creole. The chorizo sausage gave a nice zesty accent to this dish and there was a decent amount of shrimp. There were plenty of textural elements and it was definitely not boring nor gimmicky. The house beer was a refreshing compliment. Service was prompt and friendly on a Sunday evening."

2) Moi Moi (Bean Cake)
    A little bland, but can&#39;t quite get over the consistency.   However,  it was an enjoyable experience to try and the cost ($2.99) was worth the exploration!!!

3) Efo Riro (Spinach)
     Delicious Blend of Spinach and Collard Greens, with a little spicy punch-- not overbearing spicy punch !!!  This is also another one I would order again !!!

4) Jalloff Rice
      I chose Whiting Fish.  It was delectable!!! I chose Delicious (Bone - in) Whiting as my meat, Rice, and Plantain!!!  Another one I would order again!!!!

5) Ayamashe 
     Served with tender, falling-off-the-bone Goat.  Spicy Definitely Spicy, but you&#39;ve gotta appreciate the FLAVOR!!! Order again!!!! Just ask for more water!

I&#39;ve never tried any type of African food and I am more than impressed!

This is what four of us shared (yes, I like to share A LOT):
Suya/Beef Kabob
Goat Pepper Soup
Efo Riro - Spinach Veggie Soup served with Pounded Yam and side of plantains
Beans &amp; Corn Porridge
Ayamashe - green bell pepper with spice and herbs. serviced with white rice and fish
Jallof Rice - chicken in fresh tomato and sweet bell pepper puree with spices, side of plantain

My favorites? The goat pepper soup - AHMAZING!! Hot and spicy, just the way I like my soup. It would be great as a hangover meal...just saying. The Jallof Rice - it had a mole consistency and that&#39;s all I needed to know. The Ayamashe - just the right amount of spice in their pepper mix and I liked that the fish was a side. 

The owner, Anthony, helped us out whenever we had any questions about everything on the menu. He also recommended beers we should have with our meals. Great customer service.

This place is amazing especially considering I never had African food before! Had this place bookmarked for a while so we decided to try it for date night today.

For an app, I got the beef kabob. It was phenomenal. The beef was very lean, extremely tender and nicely flavorful. It had a nice spice to it that tipped it off just right but it wasn&#39;t overbearing.

For dinner, I got the Jallof Rice with goat. That dish was divine! The right was perfectly seasoned and small hint of flavorful sweetness that added to the complexity of the flavors the meat was seasoned with. The plantains were the best I EVER had. Very tender and perfectly sweet. The ambiance in here is pleasant and the owner is very nice. DEFINITELY worth a return!"

My +1 had his heart set on a &#34;suburban chain and/or theme restaurant&#34; for dinner. I talked him down from TGIFriday&#39;s  (Whaaat?! *eyeroll*) and we were en route to a kitschy tropical-themed place in Schaumburg. When we passed Bisi, he relented on the original plan and encouraged a u-turn. Yay! #win

Decór: Clean, spacious, minimal, with the white-tablecloth-with-butcher-paper thing going on, plus cloth napkins + a paper one. The booths seem a bit dated as compared with the rest of the place.  It has what looks to be a full bar.

We asked the owner&#39;s opinion on a few dishes. He explained they were out of beef for entrées (they had kabob apps, though) so meat choices were chicken, fish, and goat. We found out, while ordering, that there is a $2 upcharge for the goat, but we still went with it.

We ordered:
- Ayamashe w/goat
- Jallof rice w/goat
- Efron Riro w/fish
- one fruit juice


Verdict:

Ayamashe: 4/5
This was my favorite of the 3 dishes: the sauce had good flavor, moderate heat, and the goat was very tender on the inside. (If you&#39;re sensitive to heat, you might skip this one..) There was a LOT of rice and little meat/plantains, though, so disproportionate.


Efron Riro: 4/5
My second favorite. This was a spontaneous order on our part: after we put in the other two entree orders, my +1 noted the pillowy-looking fufu yam on the menu and was curious to try it. 

The fish was very good: crispy and flavorful. The texture of the yam was dense, but was a good use to help sop up the spinach and sauce. (I left the yam out in the leftovers, though, due to the heaviness of it, and just took the spinach.) The flavor of the spinach/sauce was good!


Jallof Rice: 3/5
I thought the flavors were pretty muted and plain. The rice was orangeish, but had minimal spice and depth of flavor. This dish had TWO pieces of goat.. AND a $2 upcharge on it? I found this disappointing and I think my guy did too.

Pre-tip total = $38


Service: Moderately attentive. It was a Thursday, and aside from a patron dining at the bar, we were the only others for 45 minutes or so. Water glasses were refilled, though, and the owner was nice in answering our questions.


In all, Bisi was a good culinary experience: Nigerian food FTW!  I would definitely get the Ayamashe again - with goat or fish - and would like to try some of the vegetarian options."

Bisi was suggested by one of my coworkers and I am glad we tried it. Bisi is hard to find, hidden in a little strip mall off of Roselle behind a light store and next to a flower shop. 

We came for lunch and we were the only ones there. I imagine this might be a livelier dinner location. It is a nice white table cloth dining setup but it did not feel too fancy for lunch. The bar area, lighting, fixtures, and art were all unique and very nice. 

We were served and helped by someone who presented themselves as if they may be the owner. He helped us through the menu and guided us on any questions we had. We ordered our dishes and asked us if we wanted any appetizers. He informed us it would be a minute to cook the items we ordered as everything was made fresh. We declined and waited patiently for what would turn out to be some great food.

I had the jallof rice with beef. I chose the beef as he advised this was the only meat that did not have bones. I went with this easy route. The rice, beef, and plantains were great and I can&#39;t wait to come back and try some more dishes. Specifically the egusi soup and maybe some fufu. 

*I also tried some of the Vita Malt which was describe like root beer. It was root beer-y but also quite thick. It went well with the food but could be a bit much to drink alone. I don&#39;t know if you can mix this with alcohol, but maybe that would be a good choice as well."

Started with the spicy beef kebab and it was delicious and it was spicy. Followed it up with the jallof rice with plantains, beef and chicken. The flavor was excellent, the plantains were perfect and the rice was really good, beef was tender and tasted fabulous. The Star beer is also really good.

Only downside for me was there could have been some kind of greens with the entree. Maybe next time I will ask. The portions are very generous and prices are fantastic for the quality of the food you get.

Will be back to try more on the menu!"

We had never had had Nigerian food before, and we were assuming it would taste like Ethiopian food. We started off with the Moi Moi (bean cake) appetizer, which was delicious, gizzard and plantain, and the goat pepper soup. All were great. We then got jallof rice, efo riro (which they say is a soup, but is really an entree that goes with fufu, or pounded yam), and African honey beans with goat. All were tasty but I thought the fufu/efo riro was best. I&#39;m already planning my next visit."

I&#39;ve had this bookmarked for so long. Hubs and I finally decided to give it a go as we were craving new food to try. 

We came in to a empty restaurant, this didn&#39;t make me nervous though as I knew the reviews were good. We were seated and ordered pretty quickly. 

We tried-
Beef kabob
Bean cake
Oxtail soup
Jalof rice 
The rice that began with an a (hubs dish)


Everything was so flavorful and great. I mean the flavors are so different than the typical American dish. 

It also gave me quick glimpses into my time in the Caribbean.  I joked with my husband to close his eyes and pretend we were on a beach. Caribbean food is highly influenced by African food and it reminded me of what I have eaten down south. 

I will happily be going back."

Lines all over the place and people waiting hours to get a snack. No Thank You!!! So I Yelped some high rated restaurants in the area and this one came up. I never had Nigerian food so decided it would be fun to try. 

I noticed a lot of restaurants in the area are in strip malls so I wasn&#39;t expecting much, but to my surprise the inside was very nice. You wouldn&#39;t have known it was in a strip mall. They had gorgeous art pieces throughout the restaurant. 

I wanted to order this Moi Moi (a bean cake), but they ran out so I ordered the beef kabob instead for an appetizer. I thought it came with a few - so I just ordered one order, but it was only one small kabob so I split that with my dinner mate. Very good, but I just thought I would&#39;ve gotten at least two for an appetizer. 

For my main entree - I got the beans plate. I love beans - I could literally live off beans and rice. You had the choice of rice or plantains so I got both because I like both! I did not like the beans, I was very disappointed. I really wanted to like them because I love pinto beans, but the flavor was unappetizing so I just ate the beef which was very delicious and tender with the rice and red sauce which I dipped my beef in. The side of plantains also came in handy - which were good. Kind of reminded me of a Latin dish with a mix of Indian spices. 

Overall, they have a small menu but lots of good choices to choose from. They sort there menu as vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The prices are very reasonable, especially with the portions they give  you. It had to be my cheapest and nicest dining experience."

I had the beef kabobs which were perfectly charred and artfully presented.  The moi moi came out in a tall cylinder shape and I had to experiment on how to cut it... but it was an excellent side for the spinach stew with fish. The server suggested plantains with that entrée which added a sweet note. I paid around $15 for a really satisfying meal. Oh... and the decor is modern with beautiful artwork on the walls.

I was not disappointed.

I walked in and was greeted by... Anthony, I think. We struck up a conversation because, well, I was the only person in at 11:30 on a Wednesday for lunch. A quick perusal of the menu let me to fufu (pounded yam) with goat, because there&#39;s no way I walk into an African restaurant and *don&#39;t* get goat.

The fufu is like a big, sticky mashed potato that&#39;s dropped on your place. You definitely want to eat this with the spinach and collard greens (or for the particularly adventurous, the crushed mango seeds) because it doesn&#39;t particularly taste like anything, but works really well with either of the previous two ingredients. The goat was tender, well spiced and flavorful.

The greens were cooked in garlic, ginger, and a whole lot of spices bloomed in oils. It was noticeably spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. And one thing is for sure--you get your money&#39;s worth with an entree here. To the best of my sensory knowledge, this is true, no-compromises African food.

I paired it with a ginger beer, originating from Jamaica and by far the spiciest ginger beer I&#39;ve ever had. Over ice it went very well with the fufu.

Bisi is a great place for the open-minded to gain an introduction to African food. Just to make that point, before I left I was offered a small bowl of mango seed (because I was so interested in it). I&#39;ve never had something so sticky and earthy before, and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d have it again, but I&#39;m glad it was offered to me nonetheless. I&#39;m very glad to have a friendly place like Bisi out here."

Definitely prefer the wall booths away from traffic and other people. Food and service seemed hiccupy and the opposite of smooth... friendliness only makes up for a finite amount... unless you&#39;re in another country and on island time... go with the flow then...

Back to this... was not a fan of the meat kabob thing... tough and no flavor was detected... the Fish that came with the mashed root blob was good enough but not amazing... overall it was not a horrible dining experience but not stellar... prices being very reasonable made it okay... but personally not a fave.

The root mashed potato blob... stayed fresh enough to nuke 3 days later and still be good. Like a chewy mashed potato doughball."

The rice had a freshness which went well with the sweet plantains and savory goat. My husband also tried the malta which is a sugary beverage with a light beer aftertaste.

We went at noon on Wednesday and had the place to ourselves.  I didn&#39;t mind the intimacy and it allowed us to speak with the owner Anthony during the meal.  His wife Adebisi is the chef and owns the restaurant and he is the manager.

The restaurant is styled very nicely on the inside with a nice bar area.  One thing of note is that the right side of the restaurant has a wall with large pictures of Nigerian masks and sculptures which basically serves as a mini-museum about Nigerian culture.  It helped me appreciate what Bisi and Anthony are trying to do; diffuse Nigerian culture through food and context.

First we both ordered a Kenyan beer.  Anthony said that he has been looking for a Nigerian beer but the distributor he buys from doesn&#39;t carry any.  I hope he can find one, although I&#39;d never had a beer from any African country so I was still content.

I asked his recommendation and he suggested the corn and beans because it was simple but classic.  I was considering ordering the bean cake as an appetizer just to try it, and then he suggested it and I said sure.

The beer was good, pretty light and smooth but nothing to rave over.  Kinda tasted like a watery Stella.  

Next the bean cake.  I actually really liked this although it was super basic.  My friend and I discussed what flavors we were tasting and felt it was a good hybrid texture between the shell of an enchilada and mashed potatoes.  I was wondering if it is ever served with a sauce because that would have been fun to drizzle on top or dip pieces into.

I was glad there was a good vegetarian menu.  The options weren&#39;t hugely varied within the menu but there were small enough variations that you could change it up, although I would encourage Bisi to try to expand into more varied vegetarian dishes and eliminate some of the redundancies.  I&#39;m never too critical on plating with less traditional fare, and it is hard to attractively plate beans and corn in any dish.  The  tomato and bell pepper sauce was really what I was paying attention to and it was quite good.  The texture of the beans and corn was fine as well.  

All in all, I enjoyed speaking with Anthony and hearing about the restaurant.  I had never had Nigerian food before and it was great to try something that felt like home to him.  The restaurant is still in its beginning years (I believe around 2 years since opening) and I think they will continue to grow.

I would like to see more items on the menu.  Bisi is cooking the &#34;home style&#34; meals native to Nigeria...however, unlike Indian or Asian restaurants, there aren&#39;t flocks of Nigerians filling this restaurant.  I think adding a cosmopolitan flare would show the diversity in Nigerian cooking and the flexibility of its ingredients to lend itself to compliment and work with other cuisines from around the world.

I asked Anthony where the animals are slaughtered for the meat that he buys and he said on the South Side of Chicago in the only active slaughter house in the city.  The goats are slaughtered Halal which I anticipated but was not happy to hear.  He insisted the animals were humanely killed and had visited himself, but halal is known for not using anesthesia and is outlawed in many European countries.  I&#39;m fine leaving up to the government to address, but in the mean time, restaurants can make an impact and not purchase halal meat.

Overall, I enjoyed eating Bisi&#39;s delicious food and would recommend for anyone to stop by for lunch or dinner and enjoy a drink, a dish, and a chat to learn more!"

I&#39;m sorry.  I couldn&#39;t help myself.  *sigh*  Sometimes I am just the worst kind of person there is.

In reality this is a great place with friendly staff and fantastic dishes.  I had the ayamashe, which is a blend of green bell peppers with spices, herbs and your choice of meat - I tried the goat, since it was a bit different - and served atop steamed white rice with a side of dodo (deep fried plantains, not the extinct flightless bird, obviously).  It had the perfect spice level, enough to make my nose run but not so strong that the heat drowned out the actual flavors.  Every bite was delicious.

Be warn, it is very very spicy! Its not a normal spicy either. The broth was flavored well, even though your mouth is on fire you can still taste the broth. The oxtail was tender and the meat fell off the bone. The only thing negative I had to say about it is that, I wish the broth had some type of vegetable in it. When I was eating it,  I wanted a carrot or a celery  or something to alleviate the spiciness and have a different texture.

Jallof rice:
It&#39;s always yelp reviewers to the rescue. Everyone said to tried to jallof rice. Good job everyone!  I was not daring enough to try goat meat, so I opt for boring beef instead. BUT! Boring is not what the beef was. The beef was very well flavored and the meat itself was tender and not chewy. It was a little dry though. The rice reminds of jambalaya rice because of the tomatoes and bell pepper puree they used. I thought the flavoring in the rice was good, not too salty and not too bland. Dish is served with plaintains.

Ayamashe:
Basically, it is a rice with choice of  spicy meat cubes. We had the goat meat. Again, the meat was tender and flavored well. The rice was not as flavored as the jallof rice. But when you mix the meat into the rice, that&#39;s where the flavors come into play. It is a spicy dish, like the oxtail soup. Dish is served with plaintains.

Overall the food tasted great and the service was great too. I mean, we went on a Sunday and not a lot of people were there at the time. We definitely would come back again"

The texture of the bean cake took a little while to get used to and had some spice.  Portions were jumbo sized and a good value.  Overall, I highly recommend, especially if you like spice!"

The restaurant&#39;s atmosphere is really nice and the guy who served us ( he was the only one working the tables) was really nice and explained to us about the food. 
When I asked him if they had any desserts on the menu he responded saying 
&#34;FORTUNATELLY We don&#39;t have any&#34; lol
And he told me it&#39;s because there is no true African Original dessert/sweets so they don&#39;t have it.
I think it&#39;s good that they are sticking to true authentic African cuisine.
I&#39;ll definitely go back and try other ones on the menu!!"

I stopped by while I was in town on business in November because of the positive Yelp reviews. I wanted something different and was on my way to the airport, so driving into the city didn&#39;t make sense. Boy am I glad I stopped in! 
I had the pounded yam with chicken, discovered alcoholic ginger beer and had a nice chat with the owner. The flavors..the story behind the chicken (free range hen)..the POUNDED YAM!!! It&#39;s not often I think of a meal I&#39;ve had on the road...This is cheesy but you can legit taste the L O V E at Bisi. 
I will definitely be back next trip to Chi Town."

After reading a few of the reviews I wanted to try it for myself. You have to look for it a little - it is in a strip mall hidden from Roselle Road from an outbuilding that blocks it. But, don&#39;t let that stop you.

The first thing you notice when you walk in is how clean and well decorated it is. It is sparse, but very clean lines and not overwhelming with decor. The have a small bar that only features wine and beer.

The menu does not have too many options which was fine for us, not knowing anything about African foods. The server (I believe the owner) was very welcoming and helpful explaining the options on the menu.

My son and I both sampled the only African beer they carry, Tusker. It is like a light European lager. We also shared an appetizer - Gizzards and plantains. They combination was wonderful - sweet and savory. If you&#39;ve had southern style gizzards before, these were very different - they were tender and very tasty. The plantains were cooked perfectly - soft, sweet and not mushy like some can be.

For dinner, I had Aya Mase with rice and goat meat. This is not for the faint of heart - it is quite spicy. The server warned me ahead of time about the heat, so I was prepared. It was really great. Very tasty, very spicy. The goat meat was not gamy at all and very tender.

Jon had the Beans with rice and also chose the goat meat. The beans look a lot like Mexican refried beans, but have a distinctly different taste due to the use of a sweeter bean. It was also remarkable.

This is a first class restaurant that you should definitely try if you are around Schaumburg. We certainly will be back."

My husband and I started with the Oxtail Pepper Soup and Moi-Moi (Beans Cake) appetizers which actually complemented each other very well and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d ever eat either one by itself now after having had them together.  The soup was tasty with a bit of kick - actually just the right amount of heat for me and a little too mild for my husband (although he still thought it was delicious).

As an entree I tried the Egusi Soup with Fish and my husband had the Okra Soup with Goat.  Our server, who may also be the owner, figured out that we&#39;d be sharing so he suggested plantains as the side dish for one and fufu (pounded yam) as the side dish for the other (instead of the usual fufu with both).  Both entrees had amazing flavor that continued to build with each subsequent bite.  Delicious!

The service was great!  Friendly, welcoming, and helpful.  Our experience at Bisi African Restaurant was great and we will be back again soon."

For an appetizer, we tried the moi-moi which was very very good. My husband got a malta drink to try (it was a thick molasses, root beer-ish drink) and he enjoyed it. Since it is very thick and sweet, he sipped it slowly and had water as well. To eat, he had the Ayamashe with goat. I only tried one bite since I can&#39;t handle spicy foods as well as him. It was too spicy for my taste, but he loved it. He had plantains with it which were perfect. I had the Efo Riro with chicken and fufu. I really liked this dish and would have it again. The fufu was new to me. It reminded me of a steamed bun on the outside, but just like eating plain mashed potatoes in both taste and texture. 

It was a nice, enjoyable, and laid back dining experience. The owner was very kind and attended to all of the tables. Even though he had quite a few tables to attend to while we were there, he was very attentive and answered our questions well."

Bisi African is a MUST visit! First and foremost, I am intrigued by cuisine I&#39;ve never tried. Other than Moroccan or Ethiopian, I&#39;ve never had the opportunity to sample African food, let alone Nigerian.  Nestled in a strip mall BEHIND the lighting store, you might never see this place. The owner Anthony said that he parked his delivery truck in the lot in front of the place so people could spot it. Since he lives in the northern suburbs, he decided to open a place closer to home rather than in the city, which explains the unusual location for this very unique restaurant.

What&#39;s special about Bisi is a warm, contemporary decor with booths along the window and a bar along half of the dining room. If you are wondering what to order or have questions about the menu, owner Anthony will graciously help you through the unusual offerings. We tried the spicy goat pepper soup and the gizzards and plantains as appetizers. The soup tasted much more flavorful than it looked, with a deeply spicy broth filled with the tenderest goat meat I&#39;ve ever eaten. Anthony shared his secret to a tender goat, braise it slowly! The gizzards and plantains also had some delicious spicing with diced plantains flash fried to finish them. 

For entrees we tried the spicy Aye Mase fish with steamed rice and the fufu (pounded yam) with spinach and goat. Both of these were amazing. Anthony told us he imported all of his spices from Nigeria to give his food a taste of home. 

The bar includes a couple of African beers as well as a lightly fermented palm juice which is definitely an acquired taste. I say stick with the beer!

Anthony and his partner went all in on this place, so let&#39;s give him some love and support! Bisi is his wife, hence the name. If you want to try some delicious food not on your radar, run to Bisi!"

It will get overwhelming so I suggest drinking as much as you can on its own then drinking it with your meal cause, in my opinion, it complements the flavors really well. Next, I had the Moi Moi which had the consistency of masa from a tá male. It was delicious with a different flavor that was nice as a tad spicy. Finally, I ordered the Jollof Rice with goat and fried plantains. First of all, the goat meat was tender as ever! I loved it and will definitely get it again! The rice had a very nice flavor and the plantains were sweet and soft just as they should be. Overall a very nice resturaunt that I&#39;d recommend to anyone wanting to try African food!

I have always wanted to try Nigerian cuisine but never had the courage before yesterday. I ultimately mentioned this place to a few friends and we agreed that it would be great to try as a group. As a result, I posted it as a Meetup and our group of thirteen had the feast of all feasts! 

The place is not your average ethnic restaurant. It is very contemporary, airy and upscale. The table linens cause you to do a double take when looking at the menu prices. Upscale dining for the price of Five Guys. To add to the initial shock, the service was phenomenal. The owners Anthony and Bisi are great hosts. From the initial reservation to our departure, we were treated like royalty. The service alone was worth the price of the food. 

Given the size of the group, it goes without saying that we tried many things on the menu. Here&#39;s an overview: 

Beef Kabob- served with onions and just enough kick to get your nose running. We all loved it!! .... It is one piece per serving for $2.49.     5 stars 

Moi Moi - a huge bean cake. It has a little flavor, similar to that of a tamale.  It was tasty but not a favorite.  3 stars 

Goat Pepper Soup - This is not for the weak. Very spicy, but amazing! Pieces of goat and in a broth.   5 stars 

Bean &amp; Corn Porridge - a vegetarian&#39;s dream. Great taste. If you need meat, there is an option for you too.   5 stars

Efro Riro - this was fabulous. Sautéed spinach mixed with collard greens, turkey meat and seasonings. It is also served with your choice of plantains or Fufu and meat (chicken, fish, beef or goat)   5 stars 

Jallof Rice - rice with tomato sauce, bell peppers and seasoning. One of their most popular dishes. It is served with plantains and your choice of meat. 

Ayamashe - spicy dish. I forgot to try it but everyone else enjoyed it. 

Gizzards and Plantains - it was enjoyed by everyone.   5 stars

We learned that meat portions are small because it is not largely consumed in their country. The pieces were small but just enough when paired with the other items. 

My favorite meats of the night were the goat and beef kabob. They were both well seasoned and packed with an amazing flavor. I absolutely enjoyed it and everyone else did too. The fish is whitting?? and it is served with the bone in. Easy to get off, but I recognize it discouraged a few. 

I also tried Malt India (a Puerto Rican beverage) for the first time here and it was absolutely divine.  5 stars"

I had no idea what to expect because I love all kinds of ethnic food but had never tried African cuisine. It was a weeknight so the restaurant (which is large &amp; spaced out) was only about 30% full so the service was prompt.

I ordered the non-vegetarian Jallof Rice and he had Pounded Yam (Fufu). Big portions. We both loved the new tastes and combinations. The plantains that came with my entree were my favorite but it&#39;s really hard to choose since it was our first time trying anything like it.

My gf and I flew to Schaumburg for a weekend (whee) and needed to get dinner on Saturday. Yelp led me to Bisi, and Yelp was not wrong - their food is spectacular. I had the spicy soup (oxtail, though it doesn&#39;t matter at all what meat goes in - the broth was to die for) and the Jallof rice. My gf had an equally amazing dish. The restaurant was mostly empty, which was mind-blowing, because they&#39;d be packed in any east or west coast city. The fact that all of the other patrons were black was not lost on me - methinks some casual racism might be at play. It could just be midwestern preference for bland food, too...

If you aren&#39;t a bigot and you love beans, rice, soup, plantains, or really just any sort of culinary adventure, you should go here. Once of the best meals I&#39;ve had this year."

We walked in without a reservation for a group of eight and Anthony (the manager/owner) welcomed us with a friendly manner. After we explained what happened to us at the other restaurant he told us he would try to make our experience with him as pleasant as possible! 

And that he did! About half of our group had never tried African food before so he patiently explained some of the dishes so we could make our choices. The food as always was fresh, clean ingredients, good size portions, reasonably priced and delicious.  

The restaurant is clean including the bathrooms, is set up for intimate conversations or can accommodate moderate size groups. There are no blaring TV&#39;s or loud music so you can comfortably hear the conversations at your table. 

Anthony functions as the host, waiter, server and bartender while his wife Bisi is the chef. There was a wonderful female server also helping and I wish I would have gotten her name. 

Anthony I hope you read your Yelp reviews so that you know how grateful our group was for your kindness and generosity that night. You have customers for life.

This was my first time trying anything Nigerian.  It&#39;s a small little hidden gem in Schaumburg.  I&#39;d bookmarked this place months ago and finally tried it a few weeks ago. 

This place is really clean too, well-decorated and family owned and really makes you feel like you aren&#39;t in the suburbs.  The service was nice, I believe that the owner was the waiter.  He answered our many questions. 

We started with the beef kebabs, which despite being a little tough, were palatable due to the unique spices they were powdered in.  The flavor was remarkable!   

For the main course we both ordered the Jallof rice with side of plantain, served with goat meat.  We also ordered a side of fufu (pounded yam), due to my wonderful Yelpers recommendations.  It was good to dip with the tomato sauce.   I have to say, I rarely carbo load like that, but it was well worth it.  The flavors were unknown to me, but I loved it.  The goat meat was perfectly seasoned and fall off the bone tender.  The sweetness of the plantain contrasted the acidity of the tomato-sauced rice wonderfully.  Overall, the meal was perfect and I am shocked that I enjoyed the different flavors so much.

Sometimes simple, traditional meals can surprise you at how good they are!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out if you&#39;re up for something out of the ordinary."

The jallof rice and fish were very flavorful. The ayamashe is certainly not for the faint of heart as it is quite spicy, but very tasty nonetheless.

The decor was very nice.  Elegant, yet casual and was very comfortable and clean.

My favorite part of the night was the food.  It was made by a single chef, the owner.  Be prepared to wait awhile for your dish, but it is worth it.  You can tell your dinner is carefully prepared.  Table&#39;s food come out individually so you know your food was prepared in a careful manner.  I was interested in trying a native African beer if there was one, but was not.  Instead, I was offered a lager imported from Kenya, Tusker.  Very good.

There is a nice bar to sit at and watch sports if you want to.  3 tv&#39;s.

I have to admit, it&#39;s gonna take a lot to keep me away from here. Like, there&#39;s nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. 

It&#39;s as if someone blessed the rains down in Africa and by some sweet, stroke of luck, the people of Chicagoland reap the benefits by way of this new, NEW Nigerian restaurant just minutes from Illinois&#39; most monstrous mall. Whodathunk? 

Toto... apparently. http://bit.ly/ZPYg8P

So anyway, I just had one of the best meals of my life at this suburban strip mall gem that opened a few days ago. I&#39;m not sure how familiar y&#39;all are with the suburbs and African food, but that&#39;s pretty much not a thing. Like, I can think of less than five places across this expansive Chicagoland burbs that allow a taste of the second largest (in size and population) continent on the planet, so this is a much needed and welcome addition to the area.

I&#39;ll be real, the outside is nothing to write home about, and the storefront is actually 100% hidden from street view so it makes it extra hard for them to get the word out. That and they (at the moment) are pretty bare bones as far as marketing tools. No website, no facebook, no PR team, but also no worries (Hakuna Matata, for those who weren&#39;t aware). This husband and wife team is so full of passion for Nigerian cuisine and the menu, rich with long-time family recipes, reflects that.

The inside is something else. Super chic, actually. I had to take a picture or you guys wouldn&#39;t believe me based on the outside, but inside is modern and there&#39;s a large, long bar (no alcohol served for now), rich colors, minimalist wall art, tall booths, and table seating for around 80 people. The menus are just the paper, pamphlet-style take-out menus, but that&#39;s A-Okay with me. They&#39;re just getting starting and for only being 3 days in, I think they&#39;re doing better than fine. 

I got to meet the owner, Anthony, who makes up the front of the house and he told me a bit about the business and why he and his wife started it. His wife started cooking when she was 6-years old with her grandmother and continued for the family, friends, guests in their home, and the food was so good (as I experienced today) that friends would come back and offer to pay her to cook for them. And Anthony worked for years as a server at the Ritz Carlton downtown, so he&#39;s more than familiar with first-class service flavor and service, and he and his wife decided it was high time to branch off and build out their own dreams. 

Anthony got me sat right away and asked if I had ever had Nigerian food before and then he asked a few questions regarding my personal and preferred tastes (do I prefer spicy, sweet, etc) and after telling him that I&#39;m a big fan of spice, but with the caveat that I&#39;m pescatarian (only veggies and sometimes fish - veg-aquarium, if you will) and Anthony was able to point me in the direction of their Jollof Rice dish with fish as my protein. 

The food came up quickly and Anthony was beyond patient explaining everything. The rice is cooked in peppers and fresh tomato - they don&#39;t do canned when there are so many great markets around to get fresh produce. My plate of food included the Jollof rice, three &#39;fish rolls&#39; and the best damn plantains I&#39;ve ever eaten. And that&#39;s saying something since I generally can&#39;t stand plantains, but these were unreal. Otherworldly, in fact. 

The &#39;fish rolls&#39;, which are not what they&#39;re actually called - just what I&#39;m calling them were phenomenal, but when you get your plate you should start with them as they&#39;ll lose their heat the fastest. They reminded me of the fish my Dad and I (mostly my Dad) would catch when I was a kid and then take home, gut, de-bone and fry up in a pan. To me, these were perfect little white-fish morsels. The only caveat is that there is a spine in these, but as soon as you cut in, the fish unfolds and the one line of bone comes right out, easy peasy.

The Jollof rice was perfectly spiced and reminiscent of South American flavors. The portion was heaping and I ended taking home half of it to eat as my dinner, and considering this hefty dish is only $9.99, you&#39;re getting quite the bargain on all accounts of price, portion and quality. I pretty much can&#39;t think of a better deal.

Beyond the phenomenal fare, the hospitality is second to none and honestly, would&#39;ve been happy just sitting their all day and chatting the young owners up... though I&#39;m mighty please that I got to dine as well. I&#39;m excited to head back (probably going again tomorrow, actually) and work my way through the rest of the menu, and while I know it&#39;s gonna take some time to get through the things I&#39;ve never had, but I&#39;m excited for the adventure to come. 

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti, I too bless the rains down in Africa... or whatever the heck needs to get blessed to ensure Bisi becomes the booming &#39;burban business it deserves to be.

Hurry boy, It&#39;s waiting there for you."

I&#39;m not just saying because its one of the only closes African restaurants that I can access easily without going into the city, but tasting the food brings this sense of nostalgic that quickly puts a smile on my face and have my stomach dancing for joy. I had try the famous Jollof rice and plantain that everyone has been raving about and I must say it truly wasn&#39;t a disappointment. I also had the Fufu and it was a bit heavy for me, but I never had something that resembles a mash potato ball before. This place can easily be missed in the lonely corner of the mall, but once found is a treasure that shall not be passed. The only reason why I&#39;m giving this place 3 stars is that it lacks a sufficient amount of vegetarian options, but oh well I will still be coming back here in the future."

I am a big fan of Nigerian food, so I was excited to find a Nigerian restaurant in Schaumburg. I ordered the egusi soup with fufu. It was truly awful. I ordered it with chicken, but it also had what looked and tasted like gelatinous fish guts in it. Ugh! Never again."

- Gizzards with plantains: Best dish of the night. The sauce consists of red peppers and tomatoes and they shine in this dish. The slightly sweet taste goes perfectly with the not-so-chewy gizzard.
- Jollof Rice: Great flavor. Not sure what the flavor is, but my taste buds loved it. The fish that came with it was slightly underseasoned but was perfect when eaten with the rice. The goat was perfect and fell off the bone.
- Fried Rice: Not sure where the liver was but it wasn&#39;t a bad dish. It could have used a little bit more flavor as it paled in comparison to the Jollof Rice dish. The chicken was a little dry.

But the best part of the experience was talking to the owner. He explained what went into the sauces and answered any questions we had. We ended up staying later than any other customer but he didn&#39;t hurry us at all. And when we finally did leave, he wasn&#39;t around but he made the effort to come outside to tell us good-bye.

Great experience, although, their interior decor could use some work. For those that judge a book by the cover, Bisi might not interest them. But for those willing to see what&#39;s inside, you&#39;ll find a Nigerian gem in the burbs.

P.S. This place is super cheap. Dinner is 10 bucks for a ton of food."

The beef is incredibly tender, and the oxtail soup was super good. The broth itself is really spicy at first, but it doesn&#39;t linger and it goes away after less than a minute. The oxtail was so juicy and I was able to cut it up with my fork. Nobody in my group was disappointed. Even the gizzards (which gross me out) tasted amazing. We will be back!"

The inside is decorated very nicely with white linens, marble bar and tasteful wall decor. It was empty at the hour I stopped in so I was greeted right away by a friendly gentleman. 
I had decided prior what I was going to try from reviews and ordered the Jallof rice with a mix of beef and goat. It is a little extra to do this. 
I had my carry out in less than ten minutes. 
The meal was very good. Both meats were well cooked with great flavor and tender. The goat was especially tender. Yum. The rice had a little spice to it but very mild. It kind if accumulated the more you ate but still mild. The plantains were good also with a little sweetness. The mix of sweet plantains and spice rice fit just right. 
Good size portion so it will be my lunch and dinner. I&#39;ll be back."

This restaurant is a hidden gem! The food and service was amazing.  Our waiter was very informative on the food that we ordered and even talked to us about how they use it in their culture, which I thought was very cool. 

We ordered the Malta beverage (I loved it!), suya/beef kabob (price is per stick),  moi - moi appetizer, and for our main entrées we ordered the efo riro (spinach dish) and jall of rice (a bean type of dish served with plantains). 

Will definitely be going back to this place again to try their other dishes!

I have been waiting to try this place - finally a new cuisine in the area! And, if you are a vegetarian, this is your place. They have tons of vegetarian options - even if you aren&#39;t you should try them! There are also meat/fish options (the goat is amazing), if that&#39;s what you are craving.

The atmosphere is quiet and clean. Everyone that works here (or walks through the doors) is VERY friendly. We immediately felt comfortable. If you have questions about anything on the menu, they are very helpful and willing to walk you through the menu. Our waiter explained what was in our dishes, and even how it is made. Very cool!

We ordered the Moi Moi, Pounded Yam, and Fried Rice. Everything was packed full of flavor - nothing artificial here! The Moi Moi is soft, almost like a bread pudding, and easily split between other people. The Pounded Yam is hard to describe - it&#39;s a lot like mashed potatoes, but it has been steamed so it becomes more firm. It&#39;s like a potato pillow. Take that with some of the greens and your meat (with your hands of course), and you are good to go! It is a tad spicy, but not too bad. Everything is pretty cheap too (each meal is under $11).

I loved it. It&#39;s different, delicious, and fast/friendly service. I have no complaints!"

We enter and this place was really nice looking, clean, but sadly empty.  We were quickly greeted by what I assume to be the owner.

We sat down and he helped explain the menu.  We were still all a little confused on what to order.  He recommended the bean cakes for an appitizer.  These were almost like polenta in texture, with a little bit of heat on the back end.  I would definately get these again if we come as a group.

For the main a couple people had the Jolloff rice, others had the beans, and I had the Ayamashe.  I had it with a mix of goat and fish.  There was definate heat in this dish.  But it was all very pleasant, and not anything that anyone should be concerned in ordering if you like a decent heat to go with your food.  The food may be somewhat close to some Indian dishes (but not really).  I really wish I could explain the flavors better, but it was pretty unique"

This time I had the Jollof Rice with Goat.  It was recommended by the owner as the fastest dish and still a great dish. There is a $1 upcharge for goat.  There are two pieces of goat.  One with bones and one as a chunk.  The one with the bone is pure perfection in cooking goat.  It is super tender on the inside, falls apart as you bite it, the flavor profiles and layers are great as you bite into it, the outside has a nice crispness to it.  Such excellence in cookery!

Repeatedly excellent service tops this off.  Be courageous, give this place a try!"

Before Bisi, I&#39;ve never woke up and thought, hot damn, I have such a craving for Nigerian food. But now I can solidly say I crave some eats from Bisi!

Anthony, the co-owner, is incredibly warm, kind and welcoming. Have no fear Yelpers, he will guide you through the menu and make stellar recommendations for any taste profile or dietary preferences. His wife scratch makes everything offered in the restaurant so whichever dish you choose, you can&#39;t go wrong.

While dining in this nicely appointed and chic strip mall gem, I sampled a few tasty items like the beef sticks, jallof rice and fish and delectable plantains. The beef appetizer is ridiculously flavorful tender even though the meat is well done. Be aware it&#39;s spicy, too! 

As for my meal, the fish was flaky and nicely cooked - a perfect mix with the spices rice and drool-inducing plantains. Get some. Get a whole bucket&#39;s worth of plantains.

There was just one person who was taking care of the service, he did seem a little rude/stressed at first but later I realized that it was just his voice and he was running around.

So we started with moi-moi - bean cakes. It&#39;s like a big pudding - pretty heavy actually. Advice for eating this - definitely add some salt and pepper. It was good though. Then we had the main course - my friend had the the beans with chicken and plantain ( I think you definitely need a side of rice or something for this). Thankfully I got the jallof rice with chicken and plantain and we ended up sharing. Both were really good, except the spicy sauce on the beans, wasn&#39;t as spicy as he claimed. That I was pretty confident of, when we were ordering. [The chicken comes in 2 pc - was a little dry, could have been softer]. The entrees were really good and plantain was really good - Fried and little sweet. 

The downside was - they don&#39;t have any desserts and probably will be difficult for the person who is taking care of service to handle all the customers if the place was full. Sunday afternoon - not so much crowd. Go ahead and try the Nigerian cuisine. :) ( Good veggie and non-veg options)"

I had the Hofbräu Oktoberfest &amp; Weihenstefaner Hefeweisse beers. Absolutely fresh and great!

The Apple Strudel was B-grade, and they did not have the vanilla sauce, but the vanilla ice cream was a decent replacement.

The atmosphere is very German and appropriate; the dudes wear Lederhosen and the chicks Dirndl-esque dresses. 

I waited 10 minutes after being seated before anyone approached to take my order. The establishment was nowhere near even 20% full. It is a big place.

The waiter brought a bread basket without asking; it was delicious, and I believe the pretzel buns are made in-house; they were warm and spongy soft and the Glendale Farms butter was great on the pretzel buns.

I ordered the German Spätzle (egg noodles, German style, with bits of some garnish), and the German Pretzel (a little crunchy, but tasted good) to eat.

Food was great. Jan was a great server. He was especially nice to our daughter. She loved that he called her princess and made her laugh. If it wasn&#39;t for Jan, we wouldn&#39;t have tried the strudel either. It was really good. Decor is fun as well. We&#39;ll be back.

The liver dumpling soup was super good. So was the cabbage on the salad offering. We also got the jaeger schnitzel and it was great. Our daughter really liked the kid sized schnitzel they had as well."

We were both very impressed. Our service was fast and friendly, though we were never rushed. We both had the goulash soup, which was delicious and full of tender pieces of roast beef. Yum. I had the pork schnitzel sandwich, which was huge! It came open-face and I could only eat half. We shared a side order of the German potato salad. All in all we had a great lunch here and left talking about when we&#39;d be coming back."

Ich mochte das Essen :) For those who don&#39;t speak German, this is good lol. I have been coming here for about 7 years and have always had a good experience. I&#39;m not a beer and bratwurst fan and I don&#39;t eat pork so I can&#39;t comment on that. I usually get the sauerbraten. Some people just serve roast beef and throw gravy on it, calling it sauerbraten. Not here. This sauerbraten is for real. My daughter gets the chicken schnitzel with spätzle and kartoffln with a Sprecher root beer.

The pretzel rolls are great and I enjoyed the soup. I usually get the German salad plate. I always get the sauerbraten and it is always tender. I love the gravy. The rotkraut and dumpling were delicious. I took my apple strudel home (way too full to eat it there) and enjoyed every fattening moment. I can tell that a lot of work goes into the food prep.

Our service has always been prompt. Maybe it&#39;s the time we go? This isn&#39;t McDonald&#39;s or TGI Fridays - they take time to cook your food so it takes time. And yes, there is a lot of it. And yes, German food is a bit more expensive than Olive Garden, but it&#39;s better quality. You&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re at your German grandma&#39;s house due to all of the cuckoo clocks, cute dishes, and other decor. The only real complaint I have is that parking can be a pain. Otherwise, viel spass at Schnitzelplatz!"

We arrived early on a Saturday with no reservations, and the hostess was very nervous and said she might not be able to seat us despite the restaurant being empty. Instead she chose to seat us and just said we would need to be done by 6 pm because of reservations. I thought this was strange, but it worked for us- so we did it and made sure we were gone. The food was decent, nothing really to write home about, but good. I loved the salad plate, and then had a schnitzel platter. The Bavarian Lodge near here is definitely the higher end version of a German restaurant, but this is a nice substitution for a more casual and less crowded atmosphere."

Being Austrian, I am pretty familiar with German food, and have been disappointed with some of the newer German restaurants that have opened up.  The Hofbrauhaus in Rosemont, right around the corner from my office, is rather disappointing when coming to food, and I was sorry to see one of my old favorites, Mirabell, go down the tubes after the owner passed away.  Schnitzel Platz, however, was a very nice return to the kind of restaurants I remember from years ago.
First of all, the entire facility is immaculate.  Tables, floors, reception area, washrooms are all very clean.  The kitchen appears to be enormous, and you can clearly see into it when walking toward the back of the restaurant.  Also appears immaculate.  The menu was quite extensive, both in food and drinks, and the prices did not seem to be that high.  The food was freshly prepared, and very generous in portions.  It was also extremely good.  I was ready to call the news reporters, as I was able to convince my cousin to eat rotkohl for the first time, and he ate it all!
I was just a little disappointed, as I thought they would have both the Oktoberfest and regular menus available, but only the Oktoberfest menu was offered.  After checking out the menu on the website, I was kind of hoping for a paprika schnitzel like Oma used to make.  It really was no hardship, however, as the Jaegerschnitzel I ordered was great.  Also, special comments on the leberknodelsuppe, which was quite tasty and also well prepared.  Now I have a chance to go back to try the paprika schnitzel after the Oktoberfest is over for the year.
Our server, Rocky, was very polite, even though he was obviously running himself ragged answering the phone, taking care of other customers.  He refilled ice tea without having to be asked, and was very accommodating throughout the entire meal.  
Definitely going back here again."

We will be back often as my wife said she thought it was wonderful! We had the Pork Shank which was excellent. The food was served hot and presentation very attractive."

Inside it&#39;s more German than you will ever see in Germany, haha. But it&#39;s somehow cozy.

Sadly, my excitement was over when the food arrived. We had a Wiener Schnitzel and the beer battered cod fish. Non of them was good. The fish was obviously frozen before. It was chewy and tasteless.  The potatoesalad which came with it was ok.
My husband had the Wiener Schnitzel and that was also very disappointing. Even if the meat was tender, it had no taste at all, no seasoning, no nothing. Very sad. 

The prices are like you are getting fresh, good food. We expected way more and won&#39;t be back."

We had a reservation and were seated without issue, but that&#39;s where the good service ended. 

We all ordered a drink plus a water, as our waiter was very knowledgeable about the beer and wine options. A separate server came back with the water tray. As he was handing the waters out, he spilled half a glass of ice water on one of my friends-- stared awkwardly at her for a second and then walked away. Ummm... really??? We were all shocked at that. 

When the waiter came back with our adult beverages, we were ready to order. A few people got an app with a meal, a few just got a meal, and two of us (me included) just got the German pretzels with bier cheese dip. The couple who ordered apps and a meal got their app within 15 minutes. The person who got a soup with his meal got that about 10 minutes after that. The rest of us sat and waited for AN HOUR or more for our food. Yes, the place was busy, but seriously?! The place was emptying out at that point too. Some of us were considering another drink and dessert but the wait for food scared us into thinking we might be trapped there all night if we ordered anything else!! They lost some good business that way. 

My pretzel was &#34;holy hell&#34; salty... I scraped off a ton of the salt and had a decent pile on the edge of my plate. The bier cheese sauce had no flavor besides also salt, and probably came from a can. I wouldn&#39;t order it again. I was totally unimpressed with my experience and wouldn&#39;t hesitate to go elsewhere for German food."

We had the camembert appetizer, saurbraten platter, and the koenigin pastetschen (queen&#39;s pastery : a flakey pastery bowl filled with stewed meat and heavy cream sauce that&#39;s like a pot pie without veggies). It was more than we could eat and there wasn&#39;t room for their gorgeous torts.

The food, bier, and live music was great. (Although I&#39;d skip the appetizer, it was just meh.) I just wish the service was better. I couldn&#39;t tell you who our waiter was because we never saw the same person. They must pool tips because the wait staff just runs around to every table and you have to flag them down.

Dinner for two was $70."

One of the spots was useless (except to us on a motorcycle) as the shrubbery was overgrown.  The interior was nice looking and much of what I expected.  We were seated promptly, and greeted by a nice gentlemen server.  The bread basket that arrived was very nice, but I would have preferred the butter to be (european style) room temperature.  The side &#34;salad&#34; was not what I had expected, it was a combination of beets, red cabbage, carrots, and beans.  I was expecting some sort of lettuce and dressing, we should have asked.  The soup was very good, but some other options would have been nice.  The food was excellent, well prepared, good temperature and taste.  The place was not that busy, but the server never came back from the time we got our food.  We never got an offer of a refill, or additional glass of wine.  We had to ask another server to find out waiter, after much time sitting around with napkins on our plates.  I believe we waited approximately 20 minutes once we were done eating without our server visiting our table.  We would have gotten dessert, but the portions were very big.  The prices were a bit higher than expected, and substitutions are not allowed so you have to pay for sides you may not want.  Every side option is approximately $5."

The food is as good as it can be on a Thursday morning when we are the only guests in the restaurant.

It was a quiet (business-wise) night at Schnitzel Platz on a Friday night when we showed up for our reservation.  Our server was mostly attentive and answered our questions (when we could hear her).  Between the three of us we had very different choices.  All were good.  Only problem (food-wise) was that our entrees took 30 minutes.  That&#39;s not 30 minutes of catching up and chatting, that&#39;s 30 minutes of brain-scrambling accordion music and the chicken dance.  When the food did arrive, mine was good, but so hot I couldn&#39;t eat it.  Although I didn&#39;t try anything else I believe they enjoyed it.  

Honestly, had I not been there with my brother and sis in law who kinda made a big deal about going there I&#39;m really not sure how I would&#39;ve handled the noise.  Something makes me think there would have been napkins in my ears though.  Or maybe just a very harsh &#34;we must leave now!&#34; to my date.  

The leftovers (most of my food) that I had today for lunch was great though.  The food is good, the music is horrifyingly loud.  

Please, turn down the music. It made me sad; on the inside."

My husband and I had the pleasure of dining here during their Oktoberfest celebration. Friday night and the place was packed. They accept reservations and with a group of 10 of us, reservations was certainly the way to go. 

The atmosphere was quite lively, there was live music, beer games and everyone was in a friendly mood. For Oktoberfest, they set up and indoor tent and line the tables up beer hall style. You&#39;re packed in elbow to elbow in seating but it&#39;s worth it. Pretty soon strangers become friends and are offering you some samples from their meals or hot peppers someone brought in. True story. Ask Osi V or Angela P, they were there and may or may not have been part of that pepper action. 

Anyway, we ordered a lot of appetizers to share around the table--soft pretzels, potato pancakes, bratwurst and other sausages and spatzle. The menu is traditional German and everything is hearty and large portioned. Everything we ordered was delicious. I can eat a whole stack of their potato pancakes--those were definitely my fave. Crispy soft, just perfect. 

Of course tons of German beer options but they also offer a full bar.  I haven&#39;t tried a lot of German beer so I appreciated the beer sampler--5 different small pours to sample.  Lots of Das Boots (2 litre boots) of beer at our table and around the restaurant. Lively atmosphere indeed!

As mentioned earlier, it was quite packed the evening we visited. Our food order got lost in the shuffle so we waited a LONG time to finally eat more than the complimentary bread. Our waiter had no idea our food wasn&#39;t brought out to us (he was the emcee for one of the games) so he quickly amended that error. They brought out sauerkraut balls on the house and provided dessert on the house too. I think they comped a bit of our meal as well. I know errors can happen in restaurants, especially when they are busy, but it&#39;s how they react to those mistakes that is important. And Schnitzel Platz was a class act about everything. This won&#39;t deter me from visiting in the future."

This time we tried the appetizer sampler and each got a bowl of soup. The sampler was so good and had a nice variety (potato pancakes, mini burgers with sautéed onions, sauerkraut balls and stuffed mushrooms). My husband is a fan of liver dumping soup so he ordered that and I got the goulash which had a nice spice to it. 

We ordered their apple strudel to go for dessert. Delish!

It seems they have raised their prices somewhat which I understand but I think they need to rethink their pricing structure (ie $5.99 for a cup of soup is a little too high in my opinion).

Other than that it&#39;s a great place for German food!

But you might as well make the trip to Rosemont for Hofbrauhaus House for better food, service, and dining experience- because this place is just as expensive and the food wasn&#39;t that good. Parking is HORRIBLE! There are about 45 spots and you get a spot when someone pulls out if you are lucky. Do not park in the other retail lots on either side-you will be towed! Inside has not been updated since 1950&#39;s, which is interesting. Service is slow, staff is not friendly except for the bartender Leo, he was great! HAVE A RESERVATION! You will wait in a small 5 seater bar area. We ate at the bar instead of waiting, we got to listen to all the wait staff complain about the people they were serving. Two stars-beer was great, Leo the bartender was great, appeatisers  of potato pancakes were great, soup and salad also great. Main dishes are $18.99-$25.99. Very dissatisfied with main meals. Blah, tasteless. Looks awesome, no taste. We won&#39;t be back and can not recommend it. Our bill was $72 for two beers, half order appeatiser, and two main dishes. Not worth the money."

We all ordered beers and they were wonderful. Our dinner on the other hand was a huge disappointment. It tasted like they made everything in advance and just heated it up when we ordered. The spaetzl were hard as if they were frozen before and then just tossed in some butter. $5 for a side of them and it was a very small portion. My schnitzel was good but the dumplings were odd tasting. I&#39;ve been to Okotberfest in Munich and this was a far cry from the real thing. 

We had a restaurant.com gift certificate that we purchased back in March to use. When we turned it in to our waitress she said they are not accepting them during Oktoberfest. No where on the coupon does it state that. The first manager came over and basically did nothing. He said no and left when I was in the middle of speaking to him. The the owner came over(I am assuming it was the owner). Old guy, white hair and beard. He was equally as terrible as the first guy. He was rude, loud, unwilling to budge. He said there was a sign on the front door stating we couldn&#39;t use it. It took about ten minutes of arguing and him making me feel like the cheapest ass in the world before he finally threw his hands in the air and said fine. It was the worst experience with customer service I have ever dealt with. The place was way too expensive for the quality of the food and with managers and owners who treat their FIRST TIME CUSTOMERS like that, I don&#39;t want to go back. I have another gift certificate to use and I will give it away before I go back."

And of course, it wouldn&#39;t be a German restaurant if it didn&#39;t have a good beer selection as well as a vast desert menu. The place is an the small side, so if you want a weekend dinner, reservations are a must."

I was searching for German restaurants in the Chicagoland area and found Schnitzel Platz. I went there with my husband and it is a lovely place. We ordered the baked Camembert, curry wurst and a Zigeuner Schnitzel. All the food we had was delicious. The red cabbage almost tasted like my grandma is making it back home in Germany. We had a great time and great food and we definitely are coming back to eat there again. It was one of the best German Restaurants in the Chicago area I went so far."

Fun, live German music with accordion, singers, bass, trumpet and plenty of &#34;oom pah pah&#34;! We had Wiener schnitzel, chicken schnitzel, appetizer of sauerkraut balls - delicious !! Large portions. All the food is handmade. All beer is served in the authentic German glasses and steins for that brand of beer. Over ten different schnitzels to choose from. Cappuccino cheesecake was awesome. There were two big birthday groups here, and still good place for date night. Fun fun fun! Even has sit down bar and gift shop. Open for lunch with the live music starting at 6 on weekends. Everyone here was having a great and boisterous time. Ach du lieber!"

When we got there we discovered it was closed at 6 PM on a Saturday night.  Which baffled us.  As we were driving to it I noticed the Schnitzel Platz.  I had never eaten there before but I tossed it out there as a suggestion, and was a short drive away.  Which she was down for trying. 

When we walked in the place was packed, but there wasn&#39;t anyone waiting in line.  The hostess asked if we had reservations, and we told her we were walk in&#39;s.  I asked if we could sit at their bar and eat and she immediately sat us there.  The place has a lot of showmanship about it in my opinion.  It seems to be decorated as a German beer hall, at least that was my impression of it.  It&#39;s a large open space with huge ceilings. There are tons of cuckoo clocks and huge beer steins decorating a shelf along the walls.  The wait staff were also carrying beers out on these long paddle things, which seemed harder than it looked.  It was a little loud but that came off more as it being a festive place where everyone was having a good time to me, and something easily overlooked.

I ordered something called Thuringer Sausage that came with sauerkraut, and warm German potato salad and my friend ordered the Veal Loaf which came with the potato salad as well.  The horseradish and mustard that came with our meal was very good and I suspect was made in-house.  We both thought our meals were very good.  The way the menu said it, I think both our meals were smaller compared to the others.  Which was good because it was so much food I barely finished mine.  With tip our meal came out to be a little over $50.  Which was certainly worth it for the meal and experience we had.

At one point while we were eating our meal, I happened to notice some of the conversations going on with the employees and later between the wait staff and some of the customers at the bar.  Which were in German.  Now I&#39;ve never been to Germany, and I&#39;ve only eaten at a handful of German restaurants but it left a good impression about our foods authenticity.  

Towards the end of our meal I was looking around and checking the place out.  I noticed two older gentlemen sitting on a bench near the front door.  They were drinking a beer and wearing lederhosen (A traditional German men&#39;s outfit).  I spent a minute or two trying to figure out why they were dressed up when I decided to just ask the bartender about them.  He said they were musicians that played there but were taking a break at the moment.  The aspect of them having live polka music really perked up my interest in the place.

Just as we were finishing up, the gentlemen came off their break and started playing.  From where we were we couldn&#39;t see what they were doing, but we could see everyone watching them and recording them with their phones.  As we were leaving we could see they had pulled 6-7 people away from their tables and one of the waiters was leading them in some sort of polka dance.  It was all quite silly but in an awesome fun g-rated sort of way.

I would definitely give the place two thumbs up.  It looks like it would be great for birthday parties or anniversaries."

Once again we overindulged, ordering appetizers along with a hearty entree and big beer. It&#39;s not necessarily the best German food you&#39;ll find but there aren&#39;t an abundance of them to choose from.

They live music definitely puts you in the mood for German food and beer. The place was packed at 7 but dropped off by 8, it isn&#39;t open late as one might expect when everyone is singing and dancing. We split 2 orders of the hot sausage appetizers which came with mustard and horseradish, but two of us had some of the same sausage included in our entree and ended up being a bit much. I ordered the Deutsche Haus Platte which includes a breaded pork Schnitzel, Frikadelle, 3 sausages, home fries, red cabbage, sauerkraut, and I chose their black forest ham soup. Everything was pretty decent and I was full, but of course my bro ordered up a few desserts for everyone to share. 

If you&#39;re in the area come check this place out, you can&#39;t go wrong with sausage and das boot."

Neither is German beer. Am I German? Why yes, yes I am. I represent with the blonde hair but that&#39;s about all I got. 

For those looking for a good time - this is the place to go. While the menu is not my style, at least I can come here and be entertained. I&#39;ve been twice, both in December near Christmas in the evening on the weekend. The band plays the 12 Days of Christmas and each table has a part. It&#39;s fun, loud and totally different than any other restaurant I&#39;ve been to. 

The first time I came here, I had already eaten (we had late reservations) so I ordered the Gebackener Camenbert. I had never heard of it, but saw &#34;breaded&#34; and &#34;raspberry&#34; and thought, &#34;that&#39;s gotta be good!&#34; It was. It was also HUGE. If ordering as an appetizer, easily for 4-6 people. For me as something to munch on? Too much cheese! It was delicious though - gooey, creamy, crunchy and sweet. 

The second time I visited, I KNEW to eat beforehand and was completely full. I ordered a coffee, and had planned to order a drink, however our server was less than present. 

They offer beer in boots, which is AWESOME (for those that drink it!). Every person that I go with is always more than pleased with their plates of sausage so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s great!

All being said: it&#39;s a neat place. Fun and energetic with the band. But for those non-sausage-and-fried-potato-eating fans, there&#39;s not much to offer on the menu."

I moved to the southern suburbs a few years ago and decided to take my German Club to Schnitzel Platz Saturday 4/16/16.We arrived at 2:30 with a group of 6 people. Not many people in the restaurant so it was nice and quiet, but while we were wrapping up I could see the restaurant was preparing for a busy night as a lot of tables had &#34;reserved&#34; signs on them. I am a creature of habit and ordered my usual dish - Hawaiian Schnitzel with red cabbage and German fries. I love the cheese and pineapple on the schnitzel giving it a sweet and cheesy taste. Overall we had a great time and Leo was our server and was prompt and polite. A + to the Schnitzel Platz."

The house salad was pretty good.  Unfortunately the main course (pork shank) was cooked unevenly.  One side was tough and chewy.  I think it probably needed an hour or so more of cook time.  It should have fell off the bone and almost melted in my mouth.  However the toughness of one side really caused me to rate them lower.  The two old guys playing music were pretty cool.

Schnitzel Platz is by far the best, most authentic German restaurant I have ever been to.  I love German food and every other restaurant that I go to is disappointing compared to this place.  I take everyone that I know there (when I&#39;m in town), I highly recommend ordering the &#39;Prince Leopold for Two&#39;, as long as there are ywo of you and you both have large appetites and do not mind taking home leftovers.

I will base the food judgements on his comments, as I am just not a big German food fan. 

DH was in LOVE with the beer menu, he is a home brewer and loved the obscure German imports. For dinner we had the chef&#39;s choice sausage platter for a starter, and he loved them. I thought they were very good, although again, not a big fan. The he had Wiener Schnitzel with red cabbage and spaetzel and he was in LOVE. He swears the German food is as good as he has had in this area. I had a whole Rainbow trout and although a bit salty, very good and nicely presented. Someone who knew what they were doing de-boned and fileted that fish. And of course, a warm apple strudel with ice cream to put the candle in.

It is a very family friendly place, they had a couple of musicians playing all the &#34;German&#34; favorites. Although cute, a bit cheesy for my taste. But we will definitely return, if it were up to hubby, it would be tomorrow..."

The meal wasn&#39;t very big, we ordered an extra soup that we paid for, and the bread basket came after we were done. What was the splitting fee for? The extra plate?  The waitress was short with us when I asked why it was charged. She said &#39; It states it on the menu.&#39;  But with all the reading you do on your first visit, who notices the splitting fee. Could she have mentioned it when we ordered?  I hate to say it, but feeling overcharged will keep me from returning. The bill was over $60 (after tip) for basically one meal and two drinks.

Translation: SP is one of the best German restaurants in the Chicago metro area, and has been for decades.

Chef Wolfgang knows what he&#39;s doing, which is good, because he&#39;s been doing it for a while now.  Dude is OLD.  Gets crazy (read: fun as hell) during Oktoberfest, which in true Bavarian fashion is in the month of September, not October.  Bob and Hank are the 2-man band that have been there every single time I&#39;ve visited and are supremely entertaining.  Order a 1-liter stein of Weißbier, or if you&#39;re not driving home, get DAS BOOT (a magnificent 2-liter glass boot filled with your choice of brew).

Food selection is varied and almost always delicious.  The meat &amp; cheese platter is served on a section of a tree trunk!  Potato pancakes are excellent.  Nearly a dozen cakes to pick from for dessert, if you have room, which you likely won&#39;t......so get an Apfelstrudel to take home!  You&#39;ll be glad you did.

Oh, and the schnitzel?  Best I&#39;ve had outside of Austria (yes, I&#39;ve actually been, and Schnitzel Platz&#39;s really IS that good).  This place is a landmark, a Bavarian institution for Chicagoans, and Schnitzel Platz gets my top marks.

Two German thumbs-up.  EIN PROSIT!"

Wrong! They have some delicious food too, it&#39;s not always about the beer. I mean beer is good, but it&#39;s even better with the right food!

I&#39;m not an expert on German food, but Schnitzel Platz is. Their menu is huge (http://www.yelp.com/menu/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights), there is something for everyone. Upon entering we were greeted and sat immediately even though our party wasn&#39;t complete (we also had reservations on a Friday night). There was live entertainment which was fantastic! They did the chicken dance in German and sang many catchy tunes.

I started with the liver dumpling soup/Leberknodel Supper http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights?select=nn1bIHbtpwE8KLMrIh6mdA#_UQ8_Te1NMJmd_dgBpDEsQ, which was a bit bland, but still good. My boyfriend tried their Russian Ham soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights?select=nn1bIHbtpwE8KLMrIh6mdA#WwSan-EVkG0G1bF9D14spA, a special of the night, and it was full of flavor, yum. 
We opted to split the German Platter/Deutsche Haus Platte (pan fried breaded pork schnitzel, frikadelle (german chopped steak), assorted sausages, home fries, red cabbage, and sauerkraut) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights?select=nn1bIHbtpwE8KLMrIh6mdA#o5-No0wrrTPxJ1tv2f8dkw, which I really enjoyed because I got to try a bit of everything. My favorite of the platter is the schnitzel and the darker red sausage (not sure what it&#39;s called). The frikadelle lacked flavor, but I love to eat the red cabbage or sauerkraut with it, which made it gave it some taste. I also split a side of German potato pancakes/Kartoffel Pfann Kuchen (home made potato pancakes with applesauce or sour cream) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/schnitzel-platz-glendale-heights?select=nn1bIHbtpwE8KLMrIh6mdA#w5ebM-EnmZ-A3fP1dIFGow, and this is a MUST try/eat/consumer/devour. This was my favorite part of the entire meal! Layer some sour cream and apple sauce on it and you&#39;re in heaven. I&#39;m drooling just thinking about these potato pancakes. Delicious!!!

Our service was fantastic! Jan was tentative and friendly, he also recommended the Russian ham soup! 

Can&#39;t wait to go back for some potato pancakes!

Cheers!"

Instead we went home and scrounged out of the fridge. Everything was soooo bland! The bread and rolls that came before the meal were dry and tough and the butter that came with it was ice cold, so good luck spreading that. My husband did like his soup, that was about it. The lighting was insanely bright, unusual ambience for dinner crowd. We were overcharged for our beer, but once pointed out the waitress fixed the mistake. One positive, I thought the live music was nice and a little quirky. However, the family sitting next to us kept standing up and dancing with their kids practically right on top of our table. I know this isn&#39;t the restaurant&#39;s fault, but I guess these people never heard of personal space. I think this place may be more suited towards a family crowd with no taste buds. I really tried to like this experience, but it just didn&#39;t work for us. I can&#39;t see myself ever going back."

Starters: Pretzel and Potato Pancakes
Pretzel was a bit stale and just not good. Pancakes were greasy but OK with a bit of cream and Apple sauce.

Mains: Hunters Schnitzel and Weiner Schnitzel
Rubbery canned mushrooms on the Hunters and watered downed gravy on the Weiner.

Beers: Had the beer sampler which had a 5, 7oz sample of all their beers. They were OK, but might have been a bit better if the beers were cold.

Needless to say we skipped dessert there and went somewhere else."

If you&#39;ve never eaten in a German restaurant in Chicago, the first time you do, you will be astonished by the size of your bill. It&#39;s just not inexpensive cuisine (and never was).

However, if you&#39;ve not had German food in Germany, you will be very impressed. 

I enjoyed my meal. This was the better of my German-American dining experiences in Chicago. 

I had the broiled trout and it was done just right. (I&#39;m allergic to pork, and what with the veal boycott in the area, that&#39;s pretty much all you&#39;ll get these days in the Chicago Metro area.) The spetzele was good as well.   I thought the liver-dumpling soup was extremely good. No complaints on the red cabbage, either.

The beer is always good. The waiter was very cordial and (for a German place) very good at taking care of the table.

I totally recommend the pistachio cheesecake too!

As to the decor....well, since my family is from Bohemia going back few generations , it feels like home to me. However, it is NOT stylish. If you&#39;ve got family from that part of the world, you know how it is....TONS of knick-knacks over every square surface, a beer stein collection, several cukoo clocks, a few outrageously Rococo wooden grandfather clocks and of course, stuffed fish or animal heads hanging on the wall. I like it, but the style police would drop dead of shock if they ever made it in the door.

Oh yeah, this is the ONLY German restaurant I have ever seen that will do separate checks for the same table."

After lunch the waiter brought out a dessert tray.  Everything looked good and I ordered a slice of chocolate butter cream cake.  It took just one bite to realize that I did not like the taste at all.  It was bitter rather than sweet.  I told the waiter that I did not like the way the cake tasted and to take it away.  He asked me if I wanted a box so that I could take it home.  I replied that I did not like the taste so why would I want to take it home?  He stared at me and walked away leaving the awful bitter cake-like looking thing still sitting there in front of me.

I can&#39;t even comment on how the rest of the meal was because I still have a bad taste in my mouth from that bitter regretful excuse for a dessert and how my complaint was handled.  By the way, my soft drink was gone by then and I was not not offered a refill.  In addition, this was a very pricey lunch at almost $100 for three people, before tip.  I did leave a tip but not as much as I normally would have.

This was our second time here.  The first time, my wife was disappointed by a pricey, small glass of unappealing wine.  Definitely a short pour in a tiny glass.  She said so to the waiter and he just laughed and walked off.  Two strikes and I will not give Schnitzel Platz the opportunity for strike three."

Watress said the cook never saw our order. Dinner took over an additional hour and the place wasnt even half full! It was ridiculous. One person at our table ordered diet coke and another ordered regular coke. Each time the waitress brought refills she stuck her nose in the glasses to be able to tell which was which! It was really gross. (Maybe put  a straw in one next time to know the difference?!) Then the waitress took 2 dirty glasses for refills (of the same drink) and when she came back to the table said sorry ladies I&#39;m going to be honest with you but I dont know who&#39;s glass is whos. And just started handed both of the refilled dirty glasses to me.Wtf. Will never go back ever.

Angie P made reservations for a Saturday night at 7:45 pm. As always, I rolled up late but we didn&#39;t even need a reservation, there was PLENTY of seating. We got a cozy booth and got down to business. 

We all got some delicious German beer. Ange and her hubby ordered Das Boot (2 liters of booze) Yea. The beer was good but strong, I&#39;m not complaining though. 

For appetizers we ordered the Heisse Wurstplatte (Chef&#39;s assorted sausages) and the potato pancakes. That my friends, would have been enough to feed the four of us. But no, like Ange P said, we split 2 meals, the veal and pork Schnitzel. Both were the Schnit =p The plates were huge and came with hefty sides. One of them being these delicious little noodles that left me wanting more. I also ordered the Frankfurters which was pretty unnecessary. 

Afterwards, our waiter came with a huge selection of cakes. We had to say no, we were too full. They looked amazing though.

If not that it was a little bit on the sour side.  I appreciated that warning.  I do enjoy all types a food and this dish was fantastic.  I would definately order it again.  My dad ordered a type of sampler dish and I could not believe the amount of food.  My mom ordered the potato pancakes.  I was able to have a little bit of a taste and they were quite tasty!  To top things off they had a small band playing during dinner which was a nice treat.  Very much looking forward to going back.

Think &#34;German TGI Fridays.&#34;

I ordered the Jäger Schnitzel and potato pancakes which is breaded pork schnitzel on bread covered in a mushroom and bacon wine sauce. As it turned out there was precious little schnitzel and a LOT of mushrooms. Also, I don&#39;t know if the mushrooms were fresh or canned, but they sure looked and tasted canned. The bacon, assuming it was there, was lost in the morass of gravy and mushrooms. Needless to say, the whole meal came off looking and tasting like something I could have gotten at Denny&#39;s.

The potato pancakes were serviceable, but my wife, who is a potato pancake aficionado declared them &#34;hard, greasy and nearly tasteless.&#34; So there you go.

I&#39;m giving Schnitzel Plats a 2-star rating primarily because our waiter was extremely friendly, efficient and knowledgeable and they have some solid German beers. I think if I ever go again I will simply go for a beer flight."

The food was very good indeed. I had duck, which was prepared to perfection. Christopher had the rouladen special which he said was very good. I was a tad disappointed in the liver dumpling soup, because the dumpling tasted more like a regular old meatball, and the broth was very greasy. Christopher had the barley soup and proclaimed it very very good. 

We all shared the &#34;Russian eggs&#34; appetizer. It was several hard boiled eggs drizzled in a tasty white sauce served over a bed of strips of ham or something similar and then topped with strips of smoked salmon and anchovies. It was really yummy. If I go back, I will have that as my meal, even though it is an appetizer. 

Mom and my brother had the frikadeller special. It was good and the portion was huge. They have a large assortment of cakes and tortes for dessert, along with the requisite apple strudel. 

As much as I enjoyed the food, the German music, being played by a band, was way to loud. We could not converse at all. One literally had to yell across the table, which was not fun. The service was good, but they need to hire more waitstaff, as those poor people were being run ragged. 

Next time I will go on a weeknight. As much as I enjoyed the food, the music and hustle n&#39; bustle was too much for me. I felt like shouting &#34;serenity now!!!&#34; as the waitstaff literally ran past the tables."

It&#39;s our family&#39;s favorite place to celebrate special occasions and to bring out of town guests. We have tried a few other German restaurants and this place is the best!

Everything is absolutely delicious! We&#39;ve tried a number of items and our favorites are the Jaeger/Hunter Schnitzel (pork schnitzel with a yummy mushroom sauce) and the sausage sampler plate. Meals come with either a cup of the soup of the day or the German salad plate (a variety of cold German salads). And there is a nice big basket of pretzels rolls, rye bread and crackers brought to the table. The servings are very large and we always bring leftovers home. You can share a meal for a small fee. And they might seem pricey but they are in line with pricing at other German places and you do get ALOT of food. 

Now I&#39;m not a beer fan but my husband and father-in-law do enjoy their large beer selection. You can even have a litre of beer in a glass boot! They also have a number of wines and after dinner cordials which are quite good. 

And don&#39;t forget dessert! I believe the dessert menu might be smaller during Oktoberfest but normally they have a huge selection of tempting cakes and strudels. Your server might go over the tray of them pretty fast but don&#39;t worry, they are happy to repeat or answer any of your questions.

A few notes about their hours- they are closed on Tuesdays. They also are closed for a few weeks in Autumn each year to return to Germany (the owners and some of the staff are from there) so be sure to check. If you go during Oktoberfest(Sept-Oct) the center of the restaurant has rows of picnic tables with table cloths lined up to accommodate the crowds. They do have booths along the outer walls of the resturaunt though. And if you come on a Fri, Sat or Sun make reservations. They are typically packed on these nights year round.  

And I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention the two-man German band who entertains on the weekends. They are fabulous and will have the whole crowd singing along. Everyone has a little German in them at Schnitzel Platz!"

I got the schnitzel with Bavarian ham on top and husband had the chicken schnitzel sandwich.  Mine came with soup (liver dumpling) and spaetzle and he went with the oven fried potatoes.

The only reason I didn&#39;t give it five stars is that sometimes their quality control slips a little (like stale rolls).  Other than that, I like coming here.

The food is about as authentically German as you can get.  I&#39;ve tried several dishes and generally really enjoy what I&#39;m served.  I&#39;m a big fan of schnitzels and spätzle.

On the weekend they have a couple of fun old-timers playing live music and the beer and wine lists offer lots of authentic German choices as well.

If the service was just slow and relaxed like in Europe but with it, then I can say it is at least being &#34;authentic.&#34;  BUT, the wait staff is pathetic.  First, none of them speak any German nor have any cultural awareness of the German culture.  So asking any info about anything, food, beers, etc. is a waste of time.  You get that &#34;stupid look smile&#34; regardless what you say or ask.  Meaning, they really don&#39;t know what you said nor care.  Food is inconsistent.  Stale breads, either bland or too sharp kraut, so-so sausages, etc.  Very expensive for what it is.  For 3 of us it was near $100, 2 of the 3 had no alcohol, the other just one 12 oz. beer.  And one of us didn&#39;t even have a complete dinner, just a la carte appetizer and side.  It&#39;s just not worth repeating.  I gave them this return visit but no more.  It is sad that there just aren&#39;t many German restaurants that are GOOD in Chicago area.

Located just a little ways West of I-355 it&#39;s unique decor makes it immediately noticeable from North avenue. This distinctly German aesthetic is apparent in both inside and outside of the building.

Upon walking in you immediately notice old Cuckoo Clocks, German Signage and creepy looking dolls on the Walls and shelves. An Oom-pah band strangely plays a lot of American folk music (in German) and Rogers and Hammerstein covers.  

Once seated you&#39;re given both a regular menu along with a wine menu. As a German restaurant they not surprisingly have a large selection of beer, sometimes in comically sized and shaped glass containers such as a Paul Bunyon sized mug or a glass boot.

Their menu features a variety of German dishes and they also have a separate dessert cart. Schnitzel Platz also has a gift store where beer mugs and other items found around the restaurant can be purchased. 

 I sampled a fair number of appetizers and had a bratwurst entree, most of the food I was was very good, even if it wasn&#39;t exactly up my alley. If I based my review only on the quality of the food and not the price or service this would have been a four or five star review.

However, where Schnitzel Platz really falls flat is the service, it appears on a weekend evening they only had two waiters, refills on drinks were slow and nearly 45 minutes passed repeatedly between visits from the waiter. While the food was available quickly they seemed dreadfully understaffed. What should have been a 90 minute at most visit to order, eat and pay took nearly double that. The service here is terribly slow, based on this I am unlikely to visit again, even though the food itself was excellent."

I drive 40 mins to come eat with you guys. That says a lot

on my mothers birthday i brought her here since she loves it, I love it and my whole family loves it. lately the waitress we&#39;ve been getting the past few times has been nasty with me. I&#39;m really not sure what her problem is. Of course we get her this time. 

As she takes drink orders and food orders when it comes to me she glares at me and give me the nastiest attitude. I&#39;m sure sure what I&#39;ve done to upset her but I can assure you I am nothing but super curious and kind especially because I used to be a server, so I know how it is. 


I ordered green enchiladas with two sides of rice with no beans. pretty simple. 
of course she makes it seem as tho I&#39;m bothering her as she takes my order.

Food comes out and part of my order is wrong. 

red enchiladas. No thanks.
So when she finally comes around to check and see if the table needed anything i mention to her that i ordered green and not red.

She gets this snarky look on her face and tells me that i have to request them to be green they just don&#39;t come like that


yes i know. I&#39;ve been coming here for over 20 years. 

I mention to her that I did, she had even repeated the order back to me. 

and looks at me and snatches the plate out of my hand and says guess i just didn&#39;t hear you.

Come on. What kind of service is that. I know its so minor but I hold you guys very up high, i recommend you guys to everyone i speak to. &amp; for her to leave such a bad impression on me makes me very sad. 

i love the food. It&#39;s great. The service of everyone else but her is also great. 


I really hope you guys talk to your employees and tell them that they should not be treating your customers so lowly. 3 times I&#39;ve had her and now i really will think of other options before choosing you guys.

The food was good, but the complimentary chips and salsa were better! Hands down, best tortilla chips I have ever had. I also enjoyed the deep fried banana with whipped cream that came with our meals.

Wouldn&#39;t mind returning just for Margaritas, Chips, and Salsa!"

The chips and salsa with the hot, pickled vegetables was wonderful and they kept bringing it out....I ordered the Carne Asada Tam-something that came with a cheese enchilada and it was great! Since I Had filled up on the chips, I took half my steak home and was even better the next day. My hubby had the shrimp dish with onions &amp; peppers and it was so good. Moreover, the food was reasonably priced, not to mention the added bonus of a free dessert! Wowza. I am giving this place 4 stars because my strawberry margarita had not salt and was mostly slush (and I didn&#39;t even know about the other flavors!)."

We dined on a Tuesday night when they have their fiesta buffet.  The food ranged from good to very good and there are at least a couple dozen items to choose from.  My favorites were the steak fajitas and the garlic chicken.  If you have a big appetite, the buffet at $9.75 is a real deal.

Our bill was only $48 for two buffets, two grande margaritas and one regular margarita.  There&#39;s not many places I can think of that offer such a good value."

I had mole and a margarita, my mom had some sort of garlic chicken and a margarita as well.

I absolutely loved my mole. It was sweet with a spicy kick. My  margarita tasted really fresh, not like when you sometimes get a margarita and you can tell its just margarita mix from a bottle. The portions here were extremely generous we had left overs and were stuffed. They give you chips and salsa (salsa was really awesome!)and they also give you a free dessert at the end, which was pretty impossible to eat since we were extremely full.

It&#39;s a little treasure just like Pita House (Schaumburg) and House of Pho (Hoffman Estates) -- that is, for Mexican, it&#39;s very affordable and tastes better than any of the faux-mexican eateries that cost more.

We had our company Christmas party here and 20 people agreed: this place rocks! Taking advantage of their Wed/Fri buffet is the best option; for $8.50/person, they have this surprisingly large buffet with hot, homemade Mexican food. It offered at least five different enchiladas entrees and a fajita station, all the way to the basics (beans, rice and toppings). I will definitely return for future dinners here, but the buffet allows you to try EVERYTHING for a great price (it&#39;s like 11:30am-1:30pm on Wednesdays and Fridays, so plan accordingly).

Check out my photos of their food also; it looks delicious and tastes even better. My yearning for Mexican food had hit a road block, as it just seemed the local small joints don&#39;t offer anything with FLAVOR. Their food is good, you know?- but it lacks the &#34;come back to this place&#34; factor. Fortunately, La Hacienda is very generous with their homemade sauces and extra-cheesy enchilada dishes.

Also of note, our host! He was INCREDIBLE; I arrived late to the party and he immediately sat me and asked what I&#39;d like to drink. A minute later, a tall glass of ice with a straw and freshly-opened, glass-bottle Mexican Coca-Cola arrived... I was so happy! I don&#39;t know if it was that guy named Danny other reviewers have mentioned, but he provided better service as a host than 99% of the &#34;fancy&#34; restaurants I&#39;ve been in. This place is wonderful and that&#39;s that."

Also on the weekend evenings they have a man singing and playing guitar which is one of my favorite things about the restaurant really.

I don&#39;t think I have ever had anything bad off the menu, but combination #4 is still my favorite.  Not a huge margarita fan either, but this place has the best (if you like strong, tangy and salty).  Every meals ends with a fried banana, with cinnamon sugar and whip cream... Mmmmm!

What is more impressive than the food is the owners and staff.  They are literally one of the most pleasant and attentive staffs I have ever dealt with.  The older I get, the more I notice the excellent service, so polite (no pushy at all).

First off I brought a water bottle because I like to have my own water and the HOST asked me to leave it at the front as soon as he sat us.... which was really awkward and kind of set the mood for the rest of the night which was really uncomfortable. Secondly, the buffet is half serve yourself (like a normal buffet) and half asking for something from someone who is on the other side of the buffet table... again awkward. The buffet food was mediocre which was surprising because their food is SO GOOD. At the end they gave us fried bananas that were cold. I didn&#39;t even try it because I couldn&#39;t stomach the thought of eating something that was fried and then cold. To reiterate we did go an hour and a half in, so I can&#39;t speak for the beginning of the buffet, but I&#39;m definitely not willing to try it again!

Just going and view the massive amount of paper mâché birds is worth the trip to this Mexican diner.

Things don&#39;t stay stagnant here either. Occasionally, you can catch a live musician set up in the corner to the left when you walk in. Sometimes there&#39;s an unlimited buffet setup (seems to happen mostly on weekends and holidays). Knock on wood, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had to wait to be seated. They always seem to find a little nook for you to sit down- the BIGGEST PROBLEM is finding a damn parking spot.

The hubs and I have gotten a variety of items over the years. They quest dip is good but rich. I can only eat a couple bites before I feel like cheese has filled my entire abdomen. Our FAVORITE thing to do is split fajitas (we ask for double meat). We both get plenty of shrimp/ beef/chicken or a combo of whatever two, for a better price than ordering two separate fajita meals.

Also, we believe the half pitcher of margarita get you the best return on investment. And their frozen marks are def worth getting. 

AND no matter what, they finish off the meal with a complimentary fried plantain thing. It&#39;s free- and pretty good SO no complaints from me!!"

During that time, I have found the food quality was inconsistent (at times a little above average to but mostly poor), the service usually bad and the music much too loud. I kept coming hoping to duplicate the experience I had during only a couple of my visits.

Well, I was taking my parents out to dinner and shortly after my party was seated, a man with a guitar mounted the stage and started playing music. The music was so loud that we couldn&#39;t hear what the person on the other side of the table was saying. We complained to the manager and he said that he would deal with it.

What happened after our complaints was eye-opening. After we complained, the wait staff ignored our table. After every song the man on stage finished, the wait staff loudly cheered and applauded the man on stage, something they had not done before we complained. The food was overdone and the attitude of the wait staff was that of sneering and smirking as though the joke was on us. Futhermore, the volume of the music was left high. 

We ended up eating as fast as we could with shouted conversation across the table and left.

Fast forward to the next day.

I called La Hacienda de Roselle to speak to the Saul, the owner, about our experience. I calmly told him of all of the problems we had with our dining experience as outlined above and then waited for his response. During the time I spoke to him about our dining experience, he said absolutely nothing, not a word. After I was finished speaking, Saul said, &#34;Are you done?!&#34;. I said yes. Then he just said &#34;Bye.&#39; and hung up on me.

That was all. No apology. No assurances of better service. No conciliatory attitude. Nothing. Just &#34;Are you DONE?&#34; and &#34;BYE&#34; in an angry tone of voice, as if I was doing something wrong by complaining. I used all caps to emphasize the words that he emphasized with his tone of voice.

Because of Saul&#39;s obviously arrogant and uncaring attitude toward his customers, which is also apparent in the attitude of his staff, my family and I will never be back.

Also, because of my extreme displeasure with La Hacienda de Roselle, I was curious, so I read some of the other 1 star reviews in an attempt to see what other people thought. To my surprise, I found Saul the owner wrote conciliatory responses to the 1 star reviewers criticisms. 

So, I decided to use this forum to say this: 

Saul, with an attitude as bad as that of you and your staff, I am sure that one by one, you will eventually alienate a significant portion of your clientele and no amount of insincere written responses will change that.

Also, you would do much better for yourself and your establishment if you put as much energy into your restaurant&#39;s quality of food, service, cleanliness and ambiance as you do in your insincere written responses."

All in all, 2 good quality alcoholic beverages and 2 entrees for $30 before gratuity is a steal. Sure, most Mexican meals are reasonably priced but the quality of the food and service at LH de Roselle makes this place worth so much more.

I ordered the Carne Asada which consisted of a huge strip of churrasco steak cooked perfectly medium-rare as requested, it was tender and every bite had an incredible burst of flavor, it was served with fluffy rice, luscious refried beans, fresh guacamole and a cheese tortilla - it was phenomenal, so fresh and authentic, I eat a lot of Mexican cuisine but La Hacienda&#39;s recipe for this classic is the best I have had.   

The restaurant was larger than what I imagined, it&#39;s not fancy, it&#39;s clean and has several different rooms which accommodates booths and tables, service was friendly and very attentive.

And the food was excellent. The chips come with two salsas and pickled veggies, super delicious.  We got the queso fundito and jalapeño poppers appetizers, and we both had the combination quatro, which was a half skirt steak, a chili relleno, and a cheese enchilada. My three favorites to order at a Mexican place, all on one plate! The steak was cooked to perfection, rare for me, medium for my love, and very well seasoned. The only part I did not care for was the rice, but I&#39;m just not a big fan of the type of rice they have at Mexican restaurants (I forgot to ask if I could sub it for something else, or just leave it off completely). The portions were huge, we ended up taking a lot of food home. Definitely enough for another meal for both of us. And then when we asked for the check, they brought out dessert, yummy fried bananas. Honestly, I can&#39;t rave enough about this place! Best Mexican place I&#39;ve been to.

The parking situation is not the best, it is a very small lot. It took a while to get a spot. We almost didn&#39;t eat there because we couldn&#39;t find a parking space, but I am so glad we finally did. Totally worth it!"

I ordered the enchiladas suiza with chicken and mole sauce. It came with Mexican rice and refried beans. At other restaurants these are just sides on the plate with no special attention paid to them and so they are usually very plain, or much to salty. Not here, the rice and beans could definitely stand on their own. They were the best tasting Mexican rice and refried beans I ever had, and that includes trips to Mexico and south Texas. The coffee was the best as well. And at the end of the meal, they bring a piece of fried banana with whipped cream. Sweet and light, a perfect end to a perfect meal.

La Hacienda has been a landmark at Irving Park Road and Roselle Rd. as long as I can remember. They are busy regularly but rarely is there a wait. This probably has something to do with the overall size of the establishment which is surprising given their location tucked away in a corner of a strip mall. 

I don&#39;t know about you, but I have pretty much concluded that any decent Mexican place I&#39;m willing to eat at is pretty much always located tucked away in a strip mall somewhere. 

It&#39;s these places that have the charm provided by the mom &amp; pop running the place. They also have the old family recipes with secrets no one else has. 

My sister and I dined here late on a Monday evening a while back and whilst it wasn&#39;t the healthiest option, it was on our way home and neither of us had been in quite a while, so we gave it a shot. 

My experience here was much better than any prior to this night. 

The service was attentive without being intrusive  the food was excellent. The ingredients were fresh.

My only complaint is that there was an abundance of onion in the somewhat over priced guacamole app which we should have skipped. Other than that, my taco dinner was delicious. I got two tacso al pastor and one barbacoa taco. I have to say, the meat in each taco was abundant and I really could have made 6 tacos out of the portions of meat in this meal. The rice was well flavored and the tortillas were fresh. While they are not homemade tortillas, they were very fresh and I was a fan of that. 

The pricing is TOTALLY reasonable. The location is convenient. The staff is helpful. 

I intend to work this place into our regular circulation of Village Tavern and chipotle. Why not some REAL Mexican food!?"

The chips were the best, very fresh and had to ask for a refill on the mild salsa. Both of our dinners were very delicious and since we filled up on the comped chips and salsa, had leftovers. To our surprise, we got a little special desert which was also very tasty.
As we were still talking after dinner, to our disappointment, smelled a very, very strong cleaning solution...come to find out that the staff was already beginning to mop the front of the restaurant. We got up immediately to leave as the smell was very strong. It was about two hours before closing time, so not sure why they started to clean up so early. Would have liked to stay and chat a bit longer, but like I said the smell was very strong. I will go there again, just hope they read this so they can refrain from cleaning so early...."

Due to a traffic snafoo, I had to call and change the take-out time I originally gave them.  The gentleman who answered the phone and who took my order initially was very nice and accommodating to that.  

The restaurant has two doors, which threw me off, but it doesn&#39;t matter which one you walk through. :) I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than the order time I gave them, so ended up waiting a bit and they offered me a seat.  There was a lot to look at: one reviewer mentioned the plentiful birds hanging from the ceiling and on the walls.  There is also chilie decor, some framed newspaper articles, and multiple plaques from local sports teams that thank La Hacienda for their sponsorship  It seemed like there were a lot of regulars (including Hispanic folk... a good sign, right?) who knew the staff, as they conversed for a while and seemed like old friends. 

The food was fresh and hot!  They added a giant bag of chips and two containers of (moderately hot) salsa. They also included containers of sour cream.

My +1 and I were originally a bit put off about the price, but the food was actually REALLY good and worth it.  Aside from the fajitas (the meat with onions and peppers), it included fresh guacamole, rice, and beans - but way more fajita goodness than the rice + beans! I didn&#39;t try the chicken, but I had a lot of shrimp in my entree!  We were pretty ravenous, but there was enough for leftovers the next day.

As a matter of fact, I love so much about this place that I&#39;ll break it down in list form so your eyes don&#39;t bleed from having to read pages of me gushing over Hacienda:

1. NICEST PEOPLE EVER. Seriously. Everyone here helps you no matter who your server is. You have people constantly checking on your food and drinks (but not in that annoying BWW &#34;Captain&#34; way) and making sure you&#39;re happy.
2. The food is delicious. And they&#39;re not snobby about you making changes like some other places (looking at you, Bien Trucha). I&#39;ve even asked to make different combinations than what they have and they were happy to oblige.
3. The place is pretty cheap. I don&#39;t know where these other reviewers are going for QUALITY Mexican food that covers an entire platter and are somehow getting it for less than $10-$15 per person. 
4. They have Jarritos for the non-drinkers, or in my case, the ones who can&#39;t drink. You&#39;ll be thankful for that sugary Mexican pop when the rest of your table is having a pitcher of delicious margaritas.
5. The place is kitschy but clean. It&#39;s not some fancy trendy place but it certainly gets the job done. I don&#39;t care about atmosphere much, but I like it here. It&#39;s nice a homey. (And there are even tvs for the people you can&#39;t pull from watching the game too.)
6. They have specials! My favorite is the buy two get one entree free. (Cheapies, come here and Thursday and then maybe you won&#39;t be so sad spending your hard earned dough.)

See you soon, Hacienda!"

Solid mexican food, friendly service, and excellent margaritas sums up my experience. I really wanted to give this location a 4 star, but I will preface for some this is likely a 4 or 5 star restaurant. Let me tell you the negatives first before the positives. The parking lot is very very small so when it gets busy it is very hard to park. There is nothing they can do about this. The other negative was I was surprised that the booths and tables were sticky. This unfortunately leaves a bad first impression. On the plus side, I found this restaurant on Yelp and was pleasantly surprised by authentic mexican cuisine in the suburbs. Our waitress was attentive and quick to come by to take our orders. I ordered the quatro combination based on the yelp reviews for 10.50 which had 1/2 a grilled ribeye or skirt steak, cheese chile relleno, and a small cheese enchilada with rice and beans. The food was fresh and the meat was quite tender. You also get complimentary chips and salsa The chips were okay, not the corn tortilla chips you typically get. I got one of the big strawberry margarita, this was likely the highlight of my meal. At the end you get a free banana type dessert which is a plus. My brother who went with was raving over the lengua tacos. He was so distraught that he left his leftovers at the restaurant which he was looking forward to eating the following day. Overall it is a solid authentic mexican dining experience with only a few small things as per above. They also have a buffet which I have not tried before.

The chips and salsa were pretty delicious - one of the salsas was really spicy.  And they serve a few pickled vegetables as an appetizer too.

We got a pitcher of tasty margaritas (pretty strong, I couldn&#39;t finish my share since I had to drive!) and then I got the chicken en mole.  It was a large portion of chicken absolutely smothered in a rich mole sauce - like swimming in it!  It was served with tortillas which I didn&#39;t use, and your generic rice and refried beans.  I asked for black beans instead of refried which they didn&#39;t have.  I will never understand why Mexican restaurants don&#39;t have black beans.  It bothers me.  Anyway I thought the food was pretty good, though not different than most Mexican-American joints I&#39;ve been to.  It was basically exactly what you hope to get at a restaurant like this, but I didn&#39;t find anything that made it stand apart from the crowd.

Oh, except the fried banana that they give you, complementary, after the meal!  That&#39;s a very nice touch.  Not worth going out of your way for, but if you live in this area it&#39;s a fine place to go for the usual Mexican-American classic dishes."

A forewarning...the parking lot is tiny, and therefore runs out of places to park pretty quickly.

First of all...this place is filled with birds. Just...everywhere. It&#39;s very different, but almost too much for my taste. There is plenty of seating, and when we were there they had a live band. The noise level was just right, so I was pleased!

We were seated right away, and were immediately brought chips with 3 salsas. Those were really good! I always like a variety of salsas. A few girls ordered margaritas that were really tasty and huge! They bring them out super fast! They have a large menu that is all really fairly priced (pretty cheap actually). And, you get a fried banana after your meal!

Then there was disappointment. At first, the service was great. We had about 3 people come up to us and ask us if we wanted drinks. We weren&#39;t ever really sure who our waiter was because we had seen so many people come up to our table. Once drinks were ordered, the service went downhill. We ordered our food, and it did come pretty quickly, but then they barely came back. A few girls wanted refills on drinks, we ordered a cheese dip that never came, it took forever to get our check, and we could barely read it when it did come!

The food was...meh. Not terrible by any means, but my tacos were barely warm and they became soggy pretty quick. I don&#39;t like soggy....anything.

I&#39;ve been coming here as long as I can remember. There was a time when I lived a few short minutes away and I would bring my son here on their buffet nights. He was little and would only eat the fresh fruit while I had some real deal mexican cuisine. 

Now, I live further away, my son still prefers fruit to mexican food and I don&#39;t have the opportunity to visit nearly as often. But when I do visit, it&#39;s always a struggle to choose. Do I get the fajitas or the enchiladas???  I really enjoy the fajitas and would prefer that they offered a combo, but alas they don&#39;t. I&#39;ve asked and it&#39;s something they don&#39;t bend on. Honestly, it is annoying, but it forces me to choose and then gives me a reason to come back and try something kinds different the next time. 

The service is friendly and the restaurant feels clean. I miss the loads of fake birds overhead. But they were dust collectors and probably just needed to go. It&#39;s a great family place with some great options. Especially when they have the buffet!"

I had friends in town so going out for margaritas sounded like a perfect plan, so I finally found myself at La Hacienda!  I have mostly positives to say:

1-the staff.  they were super friendly, kind, and helpful.
2-the chips &amp; salsa.  so good, clearly housemade.  oh also comes with pickled veggies that my friend was really into.
3-the variety of hot sauces.  my other friend tried pretty much every one on our table.
4-french fries!  as much as i love tacos i&#39;m not big on rice &amp; beans, so when i asked if there was anything i could sub out and the waiter offered french fries, i was sold.
5-the margaritas.  i had mango (i wanted watermelon but they were out :( ) and my friend got banana first then peach.  both were good, i was surprised at how good banana was.
6-the banana dessert.  free dessert that&#39;s super tasty?  awesome!

the only &#34;opportunities for improvement&#34; (code for negatives) that I saw was i wish there had been an ala carte option for the tacos.  i ended up getting french fries so it worked out, but it&#39;s nice to have that option.  both myself and one of my friends just wanted tacos but ended up with sides, too.

the steak was good, but it wasn&#39;t quite like the steak tacos i prefer.  but that&#39;s just preference, the meat itself was still good, big tender pieces.  i like my steak tacos more chopped up, but hey to each his own and it was still good food.

would i come back for drinks &amp; chips? absolutely.  would i come back for a meal?  if someone else wanted to, I wouldn&#39;t say no.  plus there&#39;s so much on the menu i suppose i could stray from steak tacos for once to try something else that i might end up liking even more!"

The buffet had 4 different kinds of meat, plenty of fruit, 3 different kind of enchilada&#39;s and lots of refried beans and rice. I went for 2 tacos and 2 enchiladas. While my 3 year old stole the watermelon off my plate. Food was good, nothing spectacular. Service was solid on getting margaritas out and sangria.

Their margaritas a pretty good but not potent as other reviewers said. I saw a table across from us had sangrias and they were definitely more potent. Strong, not too fruity sangria. The carnita taco I had from the buffet was moist, not stringy and pretty tasty. Their taco shells were crisp and not stale. Good portion on the enchiladas. I had the beef and the chicken. Their ground beef taco meat was a little on the runny side so I ate that taco first. I was full and never made a second attempt at the buffet.

My daughter loved the fried banana that was served afterwards. One of my peeves was the weirdly placed women&#39;s bathroom directly behind the hostess stand. Anytime I had to go or my potty trained 3 year old somebody was having a conversation with the hostess which meant they had to move aside so we could get to the bathroom. Also the buffet area is dimly lit. It would help if there were lights underneath the sneeze guards because I found myself peering in to see what was there and poking items after reading their descriptions. 

All in all it was a cheap dinner with friends with pretty decent drinks."

We ordered quesadillas as an appetizer, and these come with guac and sour creme. Some of the best quesadillas I&#39;ve had outside of the southside, although the guac could have used more lime or seasoning. As with other Mexican restaurants, I ordered the tacos before trying anything new. The tacos were some of the best I&#39;ve had out in the burbs! I had the taco dinner with two steak tacos, and one Al Pastor (marinated pork). The tacos were overflowing with thick cuts of juicy meat. I ordered them with cilantro and onion. I&#39;ve had better rice and beans but being that they were a side and not the main attraction, that didn&#39;t bother me much, but my fiance loved the rice.

I ordered the hibachi tuna steak. The salad and mushroom soup that came out before were pretty standard. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sauces for the rest of the meal though. I really like Tsukasa&#39;s teriyaki sauce much better. The fried rice and veggies were okay, but I did like the free shrimp appetizer as a part of the show. The tuna steak was pretty tasty also.

I&#39;ve been to many places like this before, which is why I wanted to go here, but I just could not get over the fact that our chef kept making jokes as if we were a group of children. 

We came here around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was not busy at all. We called ahead to make sure we could be seated right away but still needed to wait once we got there. 

Once seated, not much was told to us. We actually needed to ask our waitress whether or not it was still time for the lunch special because she did not inform us on anything. Our chef came out and put on the typical show but I was not thrilled because I had just graduated college and felt like I was being treated like a child. Even my father asked what exactly the &#34;ice cream&#34; he kept putting on each dish was and he replied as &#34;its just butter, but we do ice cream for the children.&#34; 

Some of our food was extremely over cooked especially the shrimp. The portions of the food we had made were small compared to other places I&#39;ve been to before. I&#39;m normally full after but it felt like an appetizer sized meal for the price of an actual filling meal.

My friend chose this place for his bday gathering, so I tried it once again. Still unimpressed.

We had a large group (with a reservation). They were not ready for us yet, so we went to the bar. There really wasn&#39;t enough room for all of us to stand/sit, and we kept getting in the way of the servers. Finally we were seated at our table.

The service overall sucked. I usually don&#39;t say that, but we all were really disappointed with the service. Our waiter took a while to come to the table. He took drink orders, and then took forever to come back. Then we waited for the food to come. Finally that started and came out at a steady pace. Then we had a different server come to the table (where did the other guy go?). He refilled some drinks and then never came back. Old server comes back way later. Where have you been?? People were waiting on drinks (especially the birthday boy), plates were hardly cleared (and we didn&#39;t have much room to begin with), just a lot of waiting. They were nice about splitting checks, I&#39;ll say that.

The food was mediocre, as I remembered. I&#39;m not a fan of their miso soup or the ginger dressing on their salad. The teriyaki chicken hibachi was ok...didn&#39;t really taste like teriyaki to me. the veggies and shrimp appetizer were probably the best part. As I recall, other places automatically give you the fried rice with the hibachi. Not here. Ugh. The chef was very nice and entertaining though. I have nothing bad to say about him.

They sang happy birthday half heartedly and brought out ice cream for the birthday boy. We did get a nice group photo on the house. But overall I can think of other hibachi places that I have had better service and food."

Our group was large (over10), the staff was very attentive, and super friendly. If your drink (soft drink, lemonade, etc, NOT liquor) was even beginning to near the bottom, somebody was replacing it.

Our food was great and the show our chef put on was fun for kids and adults alike. Nice family and/or group restaurant.

Never seen such non stop group service, they were great.

Food: we had a LOT!

Japanese soup (onion and mushroom combined) I never thought I would enjoy either, but it was actually delicious. Next was a Japanese salad with ginger sauce. Very nice combination of flavors.

Appetizers: dumplings were excellent, crab cakes were outstanding (costly appetizer at $11 for each piece) sushi sampler- fish was very fresh and sticky rice had a hint of ginger, very good.

Main course: yakisoba was very very good. The steak and lobster was insane.

Everything cooked to absolute perfection.

Tempura shrimp and vegetables was delicious, sautéed zucchini was yum!

The filet mignon and lobster tail with a side of colossal shrimp and chicken fried rice was to die for.

I find that gets old after a while.  I usually sit in the bar area and order from there.  Food is tasty and I simply love their salad dressing.  I am not a big salad fan, but, I always finish their salads due to the dressing!  They will even sell you some to take home!  Prices aren&#39;t too bad for the amount you get, and the food is always tasty.  If you have never gone, or never seen a hibachi show, then sit at their normal dining tables to get the show and have a good time.  They are ok for date night; however, they seat you at tables of about 8.  You will be sat with other people.  This has never been an issue for me.  If you want to keep to yourself you can, but, usually good conversations happen with the other diners.  Overall, a nice place to get some well cooked food.

She wasn&#39;t even driving a car, and she wasn&#39;t drunk. My friend said I could drink a couple of more beers and the waitress said but you are a woman. Again, really??? Anyways after she refuse to serve us any drinks we decided to leave. The funny think is that they were closing in 30min and I have a feeling they didn&#39;t feel like having us there anymore. It was an embarrassing situation for my friend as the lady called her drunk while other people were also sitting by us.  Terrible customer service... just terrible."

We called and made our reservation for a Monday night at 8:00 pm. I asked if gratuity was included or if we add it ourselves on top of the bill and was told it was not included.  The reason I asked is that I know it is now illegal to add gratuity to the check in Illinois without informing the paying customer, so I wanted to make sure. It was my wife&#39;s birthday and we invited her mom, dad, etc. 7 of us in all. Unfortunately we were very disappointed in the overall experience. The food was really good. Fresh and flavorful, but for the price portions were pretty small. The chef was extremely nice and friendly, attentive and fun. He actually saved the night. The waitress on the other hand, Noi, was terrible. She did not even try to look somewhat friendly, no smile, no politeness and made us feel extremely rushed. She did ask if it was our first time there and it turned out that not even 1 of the 7 people had been to Benihanans. So even knowing that she did not help guide us through the menu and show anybody or tell us where the drinks were listed. She just stood there and skipped over whoever didnt know where the drinks were and asked the next person. Finally someone asked what soda they had and she said Pepsi products. We asked if they had Mt Dew and she just said no. Instead of telling us what they did have or pointing out the drink page. We ordered 2 appetizers and she also stood there to take the entire order. We all hurried up and ordered our meals on the spot because we felt bad and thought maybe she was really busy. When the appetizer(s) came (Sushi Sampler, no other appetizer) she brought my meal (Sushi &amp; Sashimi). Since we all thought  they were both appetizers, again everyone&#39;s first time here, I had no food to eat when everyone else&#39;s  food was ready. No refills offered though. She did do a great job clearing the table throughout our meals. At the end when they sang happy birthday it was only two people who sang, when the entire night and one table after us, there were about five employee&#39;s singing. Plus the gratuity was included at 20% with no mention of them adding it to the bill. We almost tipped double and it was not very well deserved. Very disappointed and I wish I had taken my wife next door to Wildfire."

we got two rolls - the Vegas and the crunchy shrimp roll  . They were very good but the Vegas was cold . 
we then ordered the 5 course meal options .  it&#39;s just ridiculous that one course of the meal is the dipping sauces ! 
The miso soup had fried onions and mushrooms and the fried Onions gave it a little odd flavor . But with hot sauce and soy sauce it helped . 
The five course meals is realistically more like a three course meal : soup , salad , main dish ."

Then took about 10 mins for the waiter to get our drink order and they made us feel umcomfortable 100%. Then comes the food and seems like they use low quality meat I had the steak and my fiancée had the teriyaki chicken both were terrible. Not to mention they CHARGE for fried rice and steam rice is free (first hibachi place iv ever seen charge for fried rice) I have always gone to kabuki in Glendale heights and would have gone again today but did not open until 4 and my father had dinner plans for his birthday.

I have been a regular weekly Express Lunch customer at the Benihana in Schaumburg, Illinois.
The Express Lunch was just changed to where 
1. my meal was no longer cooked on the teppanyaki grill in front of me,
2. there can be no substitutions on my meal order, 
3. and also an increase in price at the same time.
The result of these changes significantly reduces the Benihana experience and reduces the quality of service.
Based on these changes to the Express Lunch, I am reconsidering Benihana as my weekly lunch time destination.
Please consider returning to the previous Express Lunch experience."

Have been to plenty of Japanese steakhouses before, but to this large chain. The expectation has always been that it&#39;s too overpriced and too commercial to provide the diner with a great meal and great experience.  Came for a very early dinner with my wife and two kids. Place was pretty empty but that is expected at 5:30. Salad and Soup were fine, both tasted fresh. The chef guy doing the cooking was friendly and very engaging with both of my kids, so that was a positive- they both had fun and enjoyed the experience... But now to the food, which was severely lackluster overall. I had the filet and shrimp combo which is $40 (plus the actually charge $4 extra if you want fried rice with tiny bits of chicken in it) I&#39;ve never been to a place that charges for fried rice, and if you don&#39;t want it, then you get plain white rice. Cmon! Dump the tiny bits of chicken and just include plain fried rice in the already highly priced bill you&#39;ll be getting. Anyway- the shrimp were just terrible. I watched the guy literally overcook to the point of rubber. They had no seasoning on them, and just tasted like rubber. Most places go crazy with the butter on them when they cook, but I got MAYBE a half a teaspoon. The steak was ok, but also super bland. No seasoning, just plain meat. My wife and kids all got chicken and there&#39;s was also super bland. No seasoning and no butter to juice it up. It was also overcooked too. Dry and tasteless. I&#39;m left with a small portion of tasteless meat and 2 orders of rubber shrimp, and my companions end up with dry boring chicken. Everything overcooked and overrated.  I&#39;m not sure the hype on this place. Service was good, chef was interactive and nice, but when you get a $200 bill for overcooked, under seasoned, and boring food... You leave shaking your head and never come back. No thanks on a return trip, that&#39;s for sure."

A. Listen to The Smiths&#39; Big Mouth Strikes Again 
B. Eat somewhere with hibachi grills and onion volcanoes capable of singeing my eyebrows off

In full disclosure, I didn&#39;t do the traditional Benihana hibachi thing here and I was alone... so even though alone is my favorite way to eat out and do most things, sitting at a hibachi table alone during an off-peak hour and waiting for more people to be seated at your sad table is not. Plus, happy hour at the sushi bar... which is a total 5-star experience. 

I&#39;m going to start with my server, whose name was &#39;Apple.&#39; She was awesome, super funny, and only a little judge-y about how much I ate but it was okay because I channeled Liz Lemon and took it as both a challenge and a compliment and at the end she even patted my back in a &#39;Way to go, Champ! Really happy you didn&#39;t choke on all that food you shoved in your face&#39; kind of way in reference to how much happy hour sushi I&#39;d just demolished. 

I&#39;ve been kind of sick for pretty much the past 4 weeks and because I&#39;m intent on infecting everyone Outbreak+Contagion style (just kidding, I&#39;m not contagious... just gross feeling/looking), I sat belly up to the sushi bar and ordered some hot tea for my throat... I think I drank 3 mini pots during the course of my happy hour stay and Apple was quick to refill me every time even though I&#39;m sure I was probably the thirstiest, most annoying customer she&#39;d have all day. 

When I first got the menu, I had the option of &#34;All You Can Eat Sushi&#34; order as I go off the happy hour menu, but the AYCE sushi isn&#39;t exactly that. You can order up to 3 rolls or 10 different nigiri for a flat rate (and of course anything you don&#39;t finish you pay full price for - standard). I opted not to do this even though the &#34;AYCE&#34; menu had some more interesting rolls on it out of principle since something with a limit of rolls is clearly not All You Can Eat. Not that I need to eat more than 3 rolls on my own, I just don&#39;t like being limited, so the Happy Hour menu is what I chose. 

Their happy hour runs Monday through Thursday from 5-8pm in the sushi bar only. There&#39;s a pretty decent sized menu with a number of rolls, hand rolls, nigiri, small plates, and apps like gyoza, edamame, etc. Most items are between $1.50 (nigiri) to $5.25 (full Rainbow Roll) and a total steal. 

I got:
* Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Jalapeno
* A second order of Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Jalapeno because the first was so good
* Spicy Tuna
* Crispy Spicy Tuna
* Tuna Sashimi w/ Spicy Sauce
* 3 mini pots of Green Tea

My bill came to just over $20 and I had to undo my belt as I sat at the bar. American success! Because the happy hour prices are pretty discounted and because Apple deserved it I made sure to leave a $10 tip so she wouldn&#39;t remember me only as the fatty that ate all their tuna because I know I&#39;ll be headed back here for happy hour on the regular."

Let&#39;s go in order: The soup was weak, salad ok, 1 vertical  slice of zucchini and white onion was not great variety of vegetables.  When the waitress asked if we wanted fried or steamed white rice, we were not told  it was a $3.60 up charge!  That&#39;s $36 for 10 small bowls of rice!! After we saw that the rice was listed in menu as an Ala carte item,  we still argued we shouldn&#39;t have been charged 3.60 to upgrade .  We could have gotten the white  rice and the fried  rice for the same price. And since the chef cooled our meals in batches of 2 or 3, we could&#39;ve done with the extra rice while we waited. 
Steak and chicken was same quality as jewel grocery.  Noodles had way too much ginger. Chef was sweet made a few jokes, but it&#39;s no dinner theater. Crowded seats don&#39;t allow to enjoy meal.

Ummmm EW. And super EW. First off I get that maybe majority of people may know the routine but for someone who has never been i would have appreciated a little more guidance. I mean i am not one for sitting down to eat with a bunch of strangers first off. One minute I&#39;m sitting alone with my girlfriends at a huge table thinking oh cool exclusive. Next thing you know im sitting around a bunch of obnoxious people. Like, uh no Susie I don&#39;t want to hear about your life while I&#39;m trying to talk about mine, thanks. Also, I wasn&#39;t sure as they were cooking if I could you know, wait till the end or if I had to eat it as it was being handed to me after being cooked. Okay, I know how silly that sounds but honestly l had no clue as to what was going on what I should or should not do what was best to do,etc. The service was gosh awful too like thanks for not helping me whatsoever. You would think their staff would try to educate us on how everything works given that it is not a traditional restaurant.
Now let&#39;s just get to the food itself-WHAT ARE YOU ALL THINKING HERE?! It&#39;s awful awful awful from the rice to the veggies to the meat to the seafood. Not to mention chopped into a gagillion tiny pieces where I can barely even taste the food. I left still hungry. Just simply not filling and not enjoyable. I mean the combination of it all just did not flow! Not to mention way overpriced. I don&#39;t know guys I just don&#39;t see where the hype is at. Sorry that I&#39;m not sorry."

I put notes in my open table reservation AND notified the host. There was a family of three also at our grill/table. So in total FOUR birthdays.

We received a mediocre meal prep &#34;show,  we&#39;re asked several times about the food preferences (not listening). My lobster tail was overcooked and extremely small!

No happy birthday song was sung by staff as it had been at a couple other tables while we were there.

I had a $30 &#34;chefs table discount&#34; for b-day, no chance was provided for me to use it...!

We were asked if we wanted to buy desert but it should have been included in our premium dishes. When they figured that out they came back and said you &#34;get one of these few flavors of ice cream&#34;... Thirty to forty dollars each and we &#34;get&#34; a scoop of ice cream, no thanks!

Finally the confused desert waiter asked if we wanted our photo taken for birthday memory (only acknowledgement of the celebration)

So frustrated we went elsewhere for dessert, paid full price ($187 for four people) and left unceremoniously feeling taken for granted and advantage of.

My opinion having experience with similar establishments, is that they are too quick to flip the tables.

They don&#39;t care, pay and get out.

Yeah, no I would never go back. The prices are ridiculous but fairly common at all Japanese steak house places. However, every other one offers greater portions, doesn&#39;t rush you out, and they&#39;re just more comfortable. I understand that Benihana is popular due to it&#39;s name and franchise, but go other places people you will not be disappointed. Try Fugi in Tinley Park or Hokkaido in Elmhurst, worth the drive!!!!!!

I usually get terryaki chicken but I love salmon too. I never see a combination of both meals on it on Benihanas or Kobe&#39;s menu so I usually have to ask if I can have both. Kobe always have adjusted to it but the waitress here at Benihana told me it wasn&#39;t on the menu so no. So I said fine and just go with the chicken. The chef was funny and nice. However both the soup and the rice was &#34;bland&#34; tasting. I literally took the guys soy sauce and used it on my rice. I don&#39;t eat the veggies, I usually give them to my husband, but my plate seemed so unfull of food for paying $25. And my husband said he was disappointed in the salad, that the dressing is usually sweet but it was really bitter this time. He eats his and my salad both but he didn&#39;t even finish his own this time..so I know it wasn&#39;t good. Our meal cost $83 total and if we would have went to Kobe it usually costs us less than $70..and we get sushi there and they throw in noodles with their meal."

The sushi was OK but nothing spectacular. I ordered the hibachi shrimp. It was a good portion but it lacked flavor. The zucchini was not good at all and that is actually one of my favorite at other hibachi restaurants. But even more disappointing than the food was the price. I was prepared to pay $25-$30 per meal. However I was not prepared to pay an extra $5 for substituting the steamed rice for fried rice. I would have been happy to pay the $150 bill if the food had been amazing or even really good but it just wasn&#39;t."

Here comes my order sushi order, I&#39;m trying not to drool as the waitress puts it down. Mental note to self: do not devour, you want to savor the moment. They&#39;ve added new rolls to their happy hour menu since I&#39;ve last been so I decided to try the Gotham roll and I&#39;m so glad I did, it&#39;s so tasty and delicious, it was gone within seconds, as fast as the speed of light!

However, my all time favorite from Benihana has to be their shrimp crunchy roll! Anything fried and has tempura crumbs on it is good right? Of course it&#39;s good! It&#39;s beyond good, it&#39;s orgasmic freaking good! So yes you need to try it!

I first ordered Miso Soup, it came as expected tasting no different than anywhere else. Next up, Sumo roll. A very American roll, fried ingredients and smothered in mayo. I&#39;d say it was &#34;good&#34;. Lastly my usual favorite, the Philadelphia Roll. 

They brought it out much quicker than expected, leaving me to ponder on if it was pre-made or not. My first piece was disappointing, and while not substantial, it only declined from there. I&#39;d compare it to a typical grocery store sushi roll (I&#39;ve eaten an unfortunately large amount of that stuff). The sesame seeds and veggies over powered the other flavors, hiding the bland cream cheese and the tasteless salmon. Something in this scenario was pre-made or left to sit out, it was not a fresh roll like I&#39;d prefer. 

Overall, three stars are given for good service, nice atmosphere, and friendly people. Two stars are lost due to  sub-par ingredients resulting in forgettable sushi. I don&#39;t regret my experience but most likely won&#39;t return. 

I&#39;m not an expert, just a normal guy who enjoys a good meal."

I work in the area so I always come in for the Express Lunch. Recently they have changed their menu and service regarding the Express. They no longer cook it in front of you and the food itself is now mediocre. Our rice was crunchy and the filet was fatty. When we complained the manager told us if we wanted good food we had to go sit in the other section. WHAT? Oh I am sorry, I did not realize I would be served lesser quality food because I am not ordering off of your regular menu.   If you don&#39;t want people to order off the Express menu then don&#39;t have it. Do not make your customers feel as if they are lower class and don&#39;t deserve good service and good food.

Chef Alex was a great entertainer as well as a great chef! We have been here before but the previous chefs were not as great as Chef Alex! He came off genuinely humorous but more importantly prepared the food perfectly to our taste! Wife&#39;s salmon was cooked so tender and the avocado sauce on top made it perfect.

We usually go during their amazing sushi happy hour which is M-Th 5-8pm.  The menu is great and our service is always prompt.  This is our go to place for sushi because of the price and quality of food.  We usually get 3 rainbow rolls and only end up having to pay just under $20 minus the tip.

It&#39;s been about 10 months since our last visit and if you read my previous review, you will understand what took so long for our return. 

We decided to go to celebrate a birthday. They ask you when you are first seated if you are there for a special occasion, as it appears many people do, due to the number of times you hear them sing throughout the evening. We informed them that we were, in fact, there for a birthday celebration. Typically, you get an ice cream and they will take your photo, etc. Just a little something to make it special for the birthday boy or girl. None of this happened. Luckily, the birthday girl didn&#39;t mind. 

Let me remind you of something I find to be very important....you can not really be in a hurry when you come here. Be prepared for a slow start to your meal unless your group fills a table. They will sometimes wait to start prepping until you have more than 3 or 4 people at a table. 

All meals begin with the soup and salad. The salad with the ginger dressing is my favorite thing on this planet! I think I need to go to a store and look for this stuff! The soup has tofu and mushrooms. I finally wised up and ordered it without mushrooms and this was no big deal to them, so I was more than pleased! We did the dinner for two and it was more than enough food. We ordered a fried rice to share. Always, one of my favorites. They prepare most of their food before your eyes, so it&#39;s always a fun show. Again, this &#34;show&#34; is what takes up time, too. 

Our glasses were kept full, our food was prepared perfectly and all special requests were fulfilled, my sister&#39;s rice with no egg, for example. The only thing that kinda bothers me is that the veggies (onion and zucchini) are served long before you have any protein to enjoy with them, and being kind gross to me to just eat grilled onions, the veggies are usually cold by the time I get some shrimp or protein to marry with them.

Everyone&#39;s food always looks delicious and watching how things are prepared, almost makes me want to try something different. This is the fun part about sitting with other people you do not necessarily know.

The menu layout was a little confusing, but we were able to find what we wanted to order, so it all worked out. 

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back before we know it."

He did some tricks that I haven&#39;t seen before. I think my biggest hang up was for the cost of what I payed for my wife and I ($75 not including tip) I didn&#39;t feel the food tasted as good as I have experience at other establishments.

The express lunch is usually a great deal and food is good. Today they started a new system for the express lunch. They do not cook in front of you anymore. The problem is that the food has gone down hill. We got our rice that is cooked on one grill but he can&#39;t keep up with all the rice so it comes out crunchy burned. The filet we got was more fat than meat. They remade it and it was the same. The manager said if you want a filet without fat you need to order from the full menu.

The guy behind him...not so good. He dropped his knife thinger AND an egg! Sucks for that table. Hopefully you get one of the better ones.

It&#39;s $20-$30 per entree, but if you sign up for their e-mail list they give you a $30 gift certificate on your birthday = free meal. SCORE. Not only that, they bring you ice cream, sing happy birthday (in both english ..and &#39;japanese&#39;) AND take a picture of you and whoever you&#39;re with and &#39;frame&#39; it. Check out the picture I posted LOL. So adorable.

As far as food goes, their onion soup was DELICIOUS. The two sauces they give you were really good too. Everything else was just..alright. Nothing worth remembering. The onion soup is a definite winner. ...and I suggest getting their sake sangria. $8 a glass, but sooo yummy.

I&#39;ll definitely be back to try out their banzai hour (Mon-Thurs, 5-8). Looks like they have $3-6 rolls and a ton of other things to munch on. As far as their hibachi dinner? See you again on my birthday!"

The staff paid attention to detail like refilling your drinks promptly. The seafood Diablo was great with fried noodles and assortment of seafood. It was a spicy sauce though, but had great flavor! The chefs are great at entertaining the guests with their cooking. The onion stacked up with the steam coming out was nice to see like a volcano erupting. The shrimp tales being cut off for you before putting them on your plate and flipping the shrimp ends with their spatula into their chefs hat. Very entertaining chefs.

If you haven&#39;t been threatened by a flying shrimp tail or have had a knife thrown in your face, you just haven&#39;t lived. Will the pile of chopped onions be a train? Will they be a volcano? Is the rice a beating heart or Mickey Mouse? You&#39;ll just have to go and find out for yourself.

Benihana has a new menu.  I think that it&#39;s basically the same options, but the layout was a bit weird.  They are calling the appetizers &#34;side dishes&#34; and the drinks are spread out throughout the menu.  

Most recently, I had a combo with teriyaki steak and jumbo shrimp.  I paid $3.25 extra for chicken fried rice, which is well worth it instead of white rice.

The good:
The atmosphere is really cool
The entertainment while they cook the food even kept the kids entertained
The sauces were delicious as was the onion soup
Sundae for your birthday...but our waitress didn&#39;t remember to actually sing (she was too busy at another table) until after the candle had melted into the ice cream...
Chicken Fried Rice



Bad:
Messed up my daughter&#39;s food (she is not sophisticated enough to want shrimp...yet....I am working on it)
EXTREMELY pricey for what you get.
Extensive drink menu
My food wasn&#39;t great
It took a really long time for each course
Service wasn&#39;t fantastic

It seems like for me, you are paying for the atmosphere and the entertainment rather than the actual quality of the food.  My lemon chicken was really pricey, and it was extremely dry and not flavorful at all.  IT didn&#39;t taste anything like lemon.

But the kids were entertained for the 2 hour meal, so I guess that was good.  OH, but the fried rice is AMAZING!!  I could have made a meal of that alone!  SO good!

I can&#39;t see that I will be back unless it&#39;s someone else&#39;s special occasion!"

The only thing I didn&#39;t like is that they sit you with another group of people who you don&#39;t even know. They didn&#39;t ask us if it was okay with us to sit on the same table with another family. It seemed a bit weird since they already had a few tables that were available.  Finally after an awkward moment with a family whom me and my girlfriend didn&#39;t know I asked them to move us.  Overall the experience was good.

On my last visit with my parents and my husband, the grill was kind of dirty and the chef (who was kind of unfriendly) never really cleaned it.  BLECH. He did a fair number of tricks, though, including the requisite onion volcano. My hibachi shrimp which were totally bland despite being cooked in the usual heart-stopping blend of soy sauce and butter, AND I asked for my fried rice without chicken and they said &#34;No problem!&#34; and then proceeded to make me fried rice WITH chicken. I did get a huuuge portion of shrimp, though. The onion soup was delicious as usual and my husband had a pretty decent sake/sangria cocktail.

My dad&#39;s birthday dessert had a pocky stuck into it, which was kind of fun!

I&#39;m sure I will go back as this is our usual Benihana when visiting my parents but hopefully they step it up a little next time. The worst day at Benihana is better than the best day at Domo 77!"

So i suggested it for my 22nd birthday. We came on a Saturday during 4th of July and it was not busy. I would consider them quite pricey for the fare they are serving. We both ordered the Rocky special (chick, steak, salad, soup, and ice cream). this was $25 a person. The chef did give us free shrimp.... but that didnt make up for it! I am easily bribed with food.... but not that EASY! 

Granted the food was good... not GREAT. but my BF&#39;s wallet is hurting and I couldve went to a restaurant similar to Benihana&#39;s in my hometown that has a dinner for 2 for $30! Thus.... I will not be back. But it was good to check out the first."

All the local seafood spots were at least a 40 minute wait, so we took our chances at Benihana.   It&#39;d been a while since our last visit (at least 2 years ago), and the experience is still good.

If you haven&#39;t been to Benihana before, it&#39;s teppanyaki/hibachi, where food is cooked right in front of you.  Our fam of 4 was seated immediately, directly across the grill and chef.  There were two couples to either side of us at the table.  We&#39;ve been here before where we either took up a whole table, or requested to be seated alone, which they&#39;ve accommodated (if not on a busy night).  We had a good time with the other couples, the kids behaved and conversations weren&#39;t mixed or intrusive.

Menu doesn&#39;t change much at Benihana -  they have a good selection/variety of choices for the grill along with a good sushi/sashimi menu.  We are always pleased with the quality and taste of the food at Benihana, and this night was no exception. We went with all seafood (Surf Side and the Hibachi Shrimp).  Most menu items come with soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice (choice of brown/white/fried), along with the entrée.  Good variety of sake and Japanese beer (Sapporo, of course).  Kids meals come with a lot of food...choice of entrée, rice, drink, and ice cream.  The kids menus are printed on chefs hats (big hit).

Our chef did the usual tricks: onion volcano, escaping shrimp, catching egg in pocket, catching shrimp tails in hat, behind-the-back rice bowl fill, showmanship with utensils, etc.  The kids loved it.  It was entertaining, and while we&#39;ve never experienced a terrible or boring showing from the chef, depending on who you get, the cooking show will either be hilarious/lively/fun, or lackluster/mediocre.  Ours tonight did good, and while he put a little &#39;oomph&#39; in there for the kids, it was still a little more on the &#39;routine&#39; side - going through the motions, more than it was with the pizzazz that we&#39;ve seen here before.  Regardless, still a good showing and food was cooked well.

Benihana can be pricey, though they offer lots of specials...good for families, for couples, groups of friends, etc.  They&#39;ve been around forever, especially this Schaumburg location.  Not hard to see why.  Always a good time here.

Also - if you&#39;re celebrating a special occasion, let them know and they&#39;ll take your photo and send you home with a souvenir Benihana frame.  There were several bdays on this night and we were treated to Happy Bday in English, and in Japanese.  Good times."

For about $10-12, you have the choice between a dozen options for your meal: a small salad, rice, vegetables and beef, chicken or shrimp or a combo. They also offer sushi and small bites plates for about the same price.
The quantity of food is just right and the quality is there.

The chef will cook and juggle at your table in a timely fashion. It&#39;s an express lunch and they mean it!

You should definitely try it!"

We came here for a friends birthday.  I had never been, but she loves it (and they provided birthday ice cream and took a picture and printed it while we were there).  However,  it got off to a bumpy start.  We were there early and they pointed us to the bar to go sit (ironically, she pointed in the wrong direction).  15 minutes after our reservation time, we noticed another party who arrived after us get seated.  I went to resolve this issue and they clearly screwed up.  The hostess was rather irritating in failing to acknowledge their screw up.  Within 5 minutes we were seated. 

The concept is neat - they cook in front of you. I have never been to a place like this so my the chef had my attention.  However, like a few other reviews, it was FREEZING (and the bathrooms more so).  Even once they started cooking, I had my wool coat on.  The vestibule between the outdoor door and the indoor door was, in fact, warmer than the restaurant.   

Between those two snafus, I gets .5 knocked off.  As for their food, I liked it.  They definitely give you a TON of it.  The shrimp appetizer was a wonderful start, and the onion soup was delightful.  I thought the veggies were a bit overcooked - but I hate zucchini being too soft. Fried rice delicious.  I do wish that they cooked it so you had some of the sides with your main meal.  I had the steak and scallops - both done to order and very tasty but not overwhelmingly buttery.  

I&#39;d go back there again - especially out there in Schaumburg."

So please don&#39;t think i complain often. Last Saturday 4 of us made reservations at Benihana Schaumburg. I have been so far at a Wheeling location a few times and had a great experience. The place was packed but it was to be expected. 

We were sited and our server was great until she brought us our drinks and disappeared. Since then we had like 4 different people that would serve our table. Which i find confusing and uncomfortable not knowing who to tip at the end. All those servers came to pick up our plates but NOT ONE SINGLE ONE OF THEM ASKED IF WE WANT TO REFILL OUR DRINKS. Well that was a definitely new experience! It got to the point that 20 MINUTES LATER WITH NO RESPONSE FROM ANYONE, and believe me we tried to call a waiter few times. I literally got up from my chair and wanted to walk by the kitchen to ask if i can get a glass of water because nobody wants to refill our drinks. It got the attention of chef that was cooking at our table and you could tell it was not ok. 

Lastly the waitress that end up refilling our drinks look rather unhappy. She asked us about dessert however skipped on one friend who&#39;s meal did not include it. I think its a shame because she wanted to order one and they would make extra money . Isn&#39;t that whats service industry is about in a first place? Selling more ???? The check was rushed in without asking if we would anything else. AGAIN BIG MINUS FOR SELLING MORE SERVICES (YES WE WANTED ORDER SOME SUSHI ROLLS TO GO). At the end my friend payed and tried to be good about it saying thank you to our waitress. SHE DID NOT SAY THANK YOU BACK!!! Talk about rude!

In conclusion I don&#39;t have great expectations from cheap or chain restaurants but when you spend $50 per plate, you at least expect decent service.

I will not be coming back to that location and will tell friends not to go there EVER! Please visit instead the Wheeling location (100 times better!!)"

I haven&#39;t had sundae (Korean blood sausage) this good since I left Korea, and they have GREAT pig&#39;s feet also!! It&#39;s that good old-fashioned, hearty Korean bar food. The cheese ddukbokki (spicy rice cake) is really comforting and delicious...very smart recipe. I&#39;m a huge fan of their bulgogi too, which is notable because I often don&#39;t like the cut of meat most place use. Their bulgogi is extremely tender and the marinade they use is perfect.

The portions are pretty hefty here, so you&#39;ll likely take home leftovers. The servers are really nice too! I&#39;m an immigrant and my Korean is rusty because I&#39;ve had to adapt to life in America, but the staff really helped me feel comfortable about speaking Korean again (which is so important to me and honestly almost made me cry). Also at a few places now I&#39;ve noticed the restaurant owners have been really cold to me when I bring my husband because we&#39;re an interracial couple, but everyone was very sweet and no one stared or made us uncomfortable.

Stopped by for a late dinner and some soju on a Tuesday night. This place serves Korean style bar food. 

Had the pork kimchi stew another dish that I don&#39;t know how to say in English (something like spicy sauteed intenstines + Korea sausage). To put it simply, the food was great. The food is a bit pricey, but the same can be said for the vast majority of the Korean food in Chicago. They also serve complimentary oh-deng tang (fish cake + broth) at the beginning of the meal that is oh so good. The service was also fine, though typically speaking Korean = better service."

It is such a non descript place if you aren&#39;t in the know you will pass by and one less person in line for a meal! I no longer live in Elgin but stop in whenever I get the chance.  I have loved Ray&#39;s for years.  For solid diner food and great service you cannot beat Ray&#39;s.  On a recent Sunday we were in town for a morning Jr Football game.  We just had to stop in for a late breakfast/early lunch.  We knew to not even bother trying the lot (the place is always packed and so is the lot) so we parked on the street and walked down.  What I did forget is that the line forms out the back.  We came in through the front and wound are way around the tables just as several parties came in the back door.  Mr Ray saw what happened and immediately directed us to the correct place in line we should have been at. That was nice and fair.  To each customer he told them which table was available.  To us he offered a tiny two seat table on the side of the restaurant telling us he would show it to us first and we wouldn&#39;t lose our place.  We didn&#39;t mind and our hungry bellies didn&#39;t mind either.  Since we were closed off from the rest of the restaurant we thought we would be forgotten.  Of course not.  Food was fast, hot and delicious. Drinks replenished with regularity.  Even though there is a line out the door they don&#39;t rush you."

I had their creamy chicken soup which I loved. Then my sister and I shared the chef skillet with a side of pancakes. Honestly it was good but nothing special. Over all it was a good experience even tho it was super small and crowded in there our waitress was still really  nice to us :)

Some weeks I only work 3 days and if it happens that I get 2 consecutive weekdays off, I get a mid-week weekend.  

So one mid-week weekend, or Tuesday as some people might call it, we had a day of errands to run and needed a place to fuel up.  With our first errand completed, I searched for a place to eat.  Ray&#39;s happened to be within 5 minutes of St. Joseph&#39;s Hospital in Elgin.  I used to work at St. Joe&#39;s, and I would always hear that Ray&#39;s was great for the morning meal, but never made it a point to try it out.

Wish I tried them earlier.  

This place is on the East side of Elgin, near Rt. 25 and Rt. 20.  You might miss it, it&#39;s pretty small.  When we walked in, at 0900 am, there were 2 tables left.  Our server was almost the same server you&#39;ve seen in movie diners, wearing that waitress dress, white orthopedic looking shoes, plastic-rimmed cat-eye glasses....

Or maybe I was imagining it.  Because this place just looks like every diner I&#39;ve ever seen in a movie.  

Goodfellas.  When Henry meets with Jimmy to discuss his case and Jimmy asks Henry to whack somebody.

Reservoir Dogs.  Mr. Pink discusses his philosophy on tipping, while the virtues of the song &#34;Like a Virgin&#34; are pored over.

Pulp Fiction.  Honey Bunny and Pumpkin discuss various disadvantages of robbing liquor stores, banks and jewelry stores, and why restaurants are the ideal place to knock over.

Casino.  Ace catches Ginger with that smarmy James Woods, I mean Lester Diamond.  Lester then gets his tuchus handed to him in the parking lot.



I understand that all of the situations I&#39;ve listed are gangster-y in nature, but none of the above activities occured at Ray&#39;s.  The only crime committed was the murdering I put on my Denver omelette.  The short order cooks here are really true to the name.  I pretty much asked for it, the waitress turned around, turned back around and dropped an omelette in front of me.  

It also happened to be very good.  I&#39;m a little particular about omelettes; I&#39;m not crazy about filled omelettes, where the egg is cooked, the ingredients put in the middle and the egg folded over, like a blintze.  I like where egg and ingredient are molded together in the pan, then folded onto a plate, because that&#39;s how I do it at home.  And that&#39;s how they do it at Ray&#39;s.  And the ratio of egg to ingredient was perfect, every square inch of egg had some ham, green pepper, or onion in it.  All omelettes come with hash browns and toast.  The tap water tastes good and the coffee is refilled early and often.  

I vote that you come out to Ray&#39;s and eat a home-cooked meal.  (see what I did there?)"

I knew the location, had seen it before, and was skeptical of such good reviews.  Don&#39;t let the location or outer appearance fool you.  There are two entrances, one in front, the other, in back.  The parking lot is small and the majority of it is in the back.  When we pulled around, there was only one space open.  We walked into a small but very busy little restaurant.  There were a couple of people in front of us and I was afraid we&#39;d have to wait but we were seen to immediately upon entering.  Thre were 2 small tables open and were asked if we would like either, or we could wait for a booth.  We chose a small table and even though by the door, we didn&#39;t feel crowded, despite folk coming in constantly.  
We sat down and I barely got my coat off and we were being served coffee.  As soon as he left, the waitress came by with menus.  The menus were clean.  Having worked in food service, this tells me they are conscientious.  We chose and had no sooner put our menus down, than the waitress was there ready to take our order.  I had a grand slam while my husband had a Denver omelet.  While waiting I noticed numerous people come and go.  Each of them were greeted or sent off with a personal acknowledgement from what I assumed to be the owner.  &#34;Heeeyyyy!  How are you?!&#34; was heard quite a bit, with much back slapping and inquiries of health and new years statuses.  It appears there is quite a menagerie of regulars.
The food was very good.  My 2 over easy eggs were perfectly cooked; not hard or rubbery.  Bacon was cooked to perfection, not crispy but not undercooked.  The pancakes were huge.  My husband&#39;s omelette had plenty of vegetables.  The hash browns are real potatoes, shredded, not frozen.  The OJ was good and coffee too.  
As we were done, I asked if we pay the waitress or at the front and her response was to say either, then ask if this was our first visit.  We said yes, and she turned to the man greeting everyone, whom I now know as the owner, Faik, and said, &#34;Faik, we have new customers&#34;.  He greeted us warmly, asked how our food was, and said he hopes to see us again.  She then told us, it is a family run affair and began pointing out nephews, a husband, a cousin, niece etc.  She has been there since 1973!!!  Holy cow.  All in all, it was a great experience for breakfast at a neighborhood establishment.  I was most impressed by the&#34; old friend &#34; feel from the staff.  We will be going again."

The servers remember what we usually order...one in particular, even if she is not our server that day, will come over &amp; say hi &amp; notices if we are trying something different.  We normally go here for breakfast or brunch but we&#39;ve tried the lunch sandwiches &amp; dinner specials &amp; they were also quite good - down home type food.  

Their parking lot is tiny, but don&#39;t let that deter you.  And don&#39;t be surprised if the line is to the door waiting for a table.  The wait normally goes pretty quick - and the owner makes sure to let you know if there are seats at the counter if you would like.

We had to wait a few minutes which gave me a chance to watch the food come out of the kitchen and the servers.  Everything looked wonderful and the servers, cashier and host, even though they were BUSY took the time to make sure everyone and everything was okay.  

It was very tight seating and difficult to get through the tables and a bit noisy...like a true diner, it added to the charm.  The food was GREAT!  And, they will give you as many butters as you want.  And, they take debit/credit cards!  One of our new favorite Sunday spots!"

The coffee was OK, the gyro was pretty good, but both the cheeseburger and the hash browns needed some work."

Restaurant is quite small with a small parking lot. But don&#39;t let this fool you, it&#39;s one of the best restaurant around, sometimes you see the line out the door (Sunday mornings) and it might feel like it will take a while to get seated but usually it looks worse than it really is and once you get your food you will be glad you staid. 

They have the most AMAZING cream of chicken rice soup they serve this on Sundays. They serve different soups each day. I go to Ray&#39;s pretty much every Sunday just for the soup alone :) all other food is delicious as well the skillets are packed with meat and vegetables eggs are cooked to your liking steak is very delicious as well."

I took a friend with me here we both got an omelette, the bill came out to be around $10 for both of us!

When you get to this place, expect a short wait.  This place is very small and compact, but their food is to-die-for!  The wait is definitely worth it.

What I love about this place is that their breakfast is not as greasy as the other places.  After you&#39;ve enjoyed your breakfast, you don&#39;t not have that overstuffed grease feeling in your stomach.  

The owner is extremely friendly, he is usually going around making sure everything came out okay.

My favorite things to get here are:
- Denver Omelette
- Waffles
- French Toast"

I&#39;ve tried a full variety of things on the menu and the only thing I didn&#39;t care for was the biscuits &amp; gravy. If you have a sweet tooth in the morning definitely get the chocolate chip pancakes--they put love in that batter.

The only downfall is that on the weekends they are always packed to the gills, so if you don&#39;t like a crowd this isn&#39;t your place. Tables turn around quickly, but they are also very close together. Service is always prompt and friendly."

The vegetarian dishes were ok. I had vada, bonda, fritters and a dosa that was brought to my table.
I then tried chicken pakodi and baby goat curry. Both were very salty. Goat curry was so salty that I had to stop eating that and go get other vegetarian curries. Green plantain stir fry was much better than the goat curry.
Now to dessert and tea... gulab jamun was oily... and there were little Styrofoam cups to get tea that look like a third the size of normal cups. The tea itself was bland.
While I  was greeted and seated with courtesy, I had to ask multiple times before they brought me Nan  to go with my meal. By the time they brought it, my curry had gone cold.
Overall, I  was disappointed with this place."

I find most buffets on Devon Ave. feature a generic menu that tastes pretty much the same. However, this place was an exception; we had three different types of rice, several types of daals, 9 or 10 different types of chutneys, 4 types of pakoras/vadas. The hyderabadi and kheema biriyani were good, but the kerala mango fish curry was exceptional. Most importantly, they are not conservative in using spices, and each dish tastes unique. 

The owners are very friendly and make an effort to get to know their cuatomers. The even serve homemade sweets after meals and masala tea, which is a great touch. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place for those who are looking something beyond the generic indian fare and are not scared of an extra kick of spices."

Chicken was soaked in colored water. Biriyanis (chicken and mutton) tasted the same. Very bad good and worse practicr (gratuity). PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE. Save some time and money.

We came as a group today (august 21) for lunch buffet. Four adults and two kids. I was very disappointed that we were charged gratuity automatically ($10) for food that was below average. This restaurant used to be my favorite and that&#39;s why I brought my friend. How come you charge $10+ for gratuity taht too for lunch buffet? I understand if its for dinner. But not for lunch.

I&#39;ve lived in Chicago for 3yrs and never was there a week I missed dining here..
It&#39;s a food heaven for a slSouth-Indian..
But,most of my North-Indian friends didn&#39;t seem to like it very much; the dishes you find in the buffet are mostly southern authentic !
I love Idly and peanut chutney above all..
But, 5-star is only for weekend buffet !

When they started the restaurant a couple of years ago, I was skeptical. But when we decided to give it a try we were pleasantly surprised. We liked it. Fast forward a couple of years, we visited a few more times last year and this year so far, I have to say we are disappointed. The quality has gone down.  When it comes to tastiness of the food its either a hit or a miss.  Also the prices have gone up and they are not  reasonable for the quality you get.  

Yeah like some people say there are &#34;lot of&#34; veggie dishes, I have to say , those dishes are barely ok just like adding fluff. I wouldnt miss any if they didnt have those either. # of dishes and quantity is not the key here but the taste. tehy usually carry 2-3 rice dishes and no offense most of them are useless except for the white rice. Although, I like their rasam. 

Now, coming to non veg dishes, very disappointed. absolutely no taste or flavor whatsoever compared to what they were a couple of years ago. they just dump or rather drench stuff in oil, needlessly. They charge for kids for a buffet for a kid under 5. Oh Please, that is ridiculous. :)

All in all I wont be able to recommend this restaurant any more to my friends and family due to the quality of the food and the price they charge for below average quality  

I see a lot of negative reviews lately and I am not surprised."

I noticed the tablecloths (the maroon cloths under the white paper) were filthy - probably aren&#39;t washed very often.

But over the years, it has really turned into bad service and food quality has become inedible. I still give it a chance every once in a while - hoping they become good again - but alas - it&#39;s been getting worse and worse.

But I still give it a four star.  

Why you might ask.  Well this place is really close to me, so it is quite convenient to order for take-out.  Furthermore, at its best, Vishnu Vilas produces good South Indian flavors. I really want that &#34;kick&#34; to be there in my vindaloo, and Vsihnu Vilas does a fine job at that.  They also make good masala dosa and kodi vepudu.  Basically you can&#39;t go wrong with their South Indian dishes.  But they do also have Northern Indian dishes such as butter chicken, if that&#39;s what you look for.  They also have buffet almost everyday.  It&#39;s affordable and the spice level ranges from mild to high - so there&#39;s something for everyone.  

This is not the fancy, chandelier type of Indian places you&#39;d find in Schaumburg.  But the food is affordable, and they&#39;re not afraid of spices.  If you like South Indian flavors and want to try something other than Priya, give this place a try!"

When I entered this place I did not feel good about the ambiance. It felt like a old restaurant with lot of noise. Then I thought I made a mistake coming to this restaurant. I went to this place for a buffet. Me and two more couple are the only ones in the restaurant. 

Once started eating food then I realized that it was very authentic south Indian food and tasted very good. I think it was maintained by Telugu family as I can hear the restaurant owner speaking in Telugu (native language of one of the south Indian states).

I had Vada, Dosa and other appetizers with different chutnies they have. I like all those except for dosa. It tasted good but I can smell that it was cooked on a burnt pan. 

Then I had veg biryani and some curries they had. I loved each one of them. As I started eating people started coming in and by the time I finished my lunch this place was full.

No one can go wrong with Pav-Bhaji but people at Vishnu Vilas did. It was nothing but a hot mixture of mashed vegetables. 
The Kheema curry was boiled/steamed rather than cooked/browned.
There were other items on the menu that lacked taste of any kind. 
The Manager or Owner of the restaurant was walking around the buffet spread using a spoon for tasting the items.

I can say this is typical authentic south Indian restaurant. Even though they had two separate sitting areas, but they seem to be little congested. The ambiance was dull and seems the furniture had not been changed for long time. The buffet menu changes every time and some remain the same. 
I remember they do have 3 to 4 varieties of Indian breakfast items such as idly, Vada, Pakoda and Dosa. Had good varieties of rice dishes such as vegetable rice and Pongal (Chennai famous rice dish).
They do have lot of chutneys and different south Indian chilly powders.
Lot of options for veggies also and I saw 2 to 3 curries every time I visited.  During every visit I tasted the south Indian Dal and it tastes excellent.
Chicken and mutton curries are perfectly cooked with spices, but it was too oily every time.
During all my visits only once I got a chance to eat keema Biryani (Goat meat chopped into tiny pieces) and tastes superb and spicy .This is the best keema Biryani till now I had!!!!
For all tea lovers, they do have masala tea (with cardamom flavor) in the lunch buffet.
The staff was friendly and no issues with the service.

The owner is a nice person and is always present and greets everyone.  The wait staff is exceptional and very nice.  The place is always full since this is the only Indian place to go to for a lot of Indians within a few miles.  The place is falling apart as if and it is very old, dirty, almost filthy look, the restrooms are very bad.

I ordered from the menu on a dinner and that was exceptional.  

But, they mostly have buffets (everyday lunch and I believe 3-4 nights) and buffet has issues, and there are more items that you can probably count.  Almost nothing tastes good, and has so much sodium in the food that you will be drinking water all night.  They get you free dosai with the buffet, and they are terrible.  The ambiance is very south indian, the spices authentic.  If you want to stuff yourself, this is the place, but do not expect a fine dining experience.

They also have a store next door, which is very well stocked, but very pricy."

He returns back to the dining area in couple of mins and got busy with his work as if nothing happened, he did not come to my table and neither discussed anything about it. I was really really hungry since morning as I was just back from a long drive. My husband insisted me to pick snacks on the way but I was so keen to eat at Vishnu Villas and this is what happened. After 15mins the service boy pass by my table where i was sitting there and eating nothing ... when I asked him what was the thing in my plate , he gave some nonsense reason and apologied me and left. I was really upset with there behavior and decided I would never ever return back. I left the place half stomach empty and paid for full meal. The least I expected before leaving the place is there would waive my dinner, but seems like thats too much I expected from them.

Not greasy.  Food is well seasoned with complex spices. Seems like every time I go in here I am just about the only white person there--mostly Indians, which is a testament to their authenticity.  They have a good selection of vegetarian choices and usually have two types of chicken, as well as &#39;mutton curry&#39; which I never had prior, but I recommend trying it.  Good variety of rice dishes. Selection of several chutneys.  I am not Indian, but have been eating Indian for about 20 years (I used to live close to Devon Ave) and I really like what they make here.  I used to come here when it was Sizzle India, and I would say that if you were a Sizzle fan, you&#39;d like this place...maybe even a bit better.  Also, they have added &#39;masala tea&#39; to the buffet which has a nice cardamon flavor to it.  Gets crowded on the weekend.  They have no alcohol, and I have never BYO&#39;d here, but a couple of my friends have, and without a problem.  My only beef is that they need to keep more nan and appetizers on the buffet...the crowd of patrons seems to snatch it up as soon as it is refilled.  They should perhaps just bring nan to the table like they did in their Sizzle incarnation.  Also, it would be nice to see Chicken 65 on the buffet once in a while.  Good luck controlling yourself; I always leave full."

So I decided to try out this new one and see if this was any different from others, chicken briyani, chicken curry, lamb curry and fish pokada were good but I thought they were more spicy to deal with even though I can tolerate higher spice level but rest of the non meat variations were very mediocre some were frankly about to spoil (mostly from a couple of days back). And the rest of stuff was very usual as compared to any other restaurant that I&#39;ve tried. End of the story is that this is not much different from any other the same old list of entrees, the same de refrigerated items from past days, the same old restaurant made milk, mango sauce ice crème, the same un tasty veggie entrees, if you are meat eater you could be fine but what differentiates this is that buffet costs under $10 and is available in the evenings but there are lots of places for improvement."

You feel like you walked into a hunting lodge. They have worked to also create a sports bar feel that will draw in more of the commuter crowd since they are so close to the train. 

I had a liter of beer, a giant pretzel, landjaeger, and chicken schnitzel. Everything was very good. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the cheese they served with the pretzel, but the mustard was good. The spaetzel served with the schnitzel was excellent and the chicken spaetzle soup was also great. 

I am certainly going to go back next time I am in the mood for some German food. The only downside was that they were very busy, and it seemed like they were unable to keep up with the orders. Not inherently bad as the appetizers and beer filled the time nicely, but I could see it bothering others."

BIG changes to the menu with less items and higher prices. I will miss those deviled eggs! They still have a large selection of German beers. Was happy to see they kept our favorite waitress, Karen!

Ordered cheese curds and potato pancakes for appetizer&#39;s. Cheese curds were greasy while pancakes were quite good.

Main entree was a slow roasted Pork Shank with a mushroom gravy, bread dumpling and sauerkraut. In my opinion, the mushroom gravy was too sour and overwhelmed the shank. Once I scraped it off however the pork was cooked perfectly and delicious.

Shared a piece of German Chocolate Cake and Apple Streusel. Cake was very good but the streusel should have had layers of flaky crust, ours was very moist and chewy.

I will come back to try other entrees that caught my eye and see if I can be influenced to increase my star rating."

I used to go to Bauer&#39;s and was watching what would open here...to my happiness it was another German restaurant. They kept my favorite waitress Karen! They still have my Vitus German beer (though a bit higher in price--that&#39;s why this is 4 instead of 5 stars). They still have amazing cheese curds. And they have even better Chicken Schnitzel. This is what I had. The curds were great. The schnitzel phenomenal and not greasy. They also had great green beans and mashed potatoes. For three people, three meals and three beers it was about $90 before tip. Not bad for a nice meal. 

The new owner&#39;s own the Donkey Inn which has been open forever so they must know what their doing and it shows with the wonderful food. A friend told me they had flown in an Austrian chef to review the recipes and I don&#39;t doubt it.

It was my hangout when it was bauer&#39;s (thats what it was called before it was sold). I just cannot go here. From the first day, the owner says he&#39;s only going to be there on opening weekend, and I&#39;ve never see him again. He&#39;s there all the time. The menu is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. and I mean OUTRAGEOUS. Food was a little better when it was bauers, but who cares.

 I walked in once after a concert at 45 minutes to close and ordered a liter of beer. the owner then gave the bartender a very hard time in front of me for serving me such a large drink  so close to last call. 

He also grabbed a girl I was talking to (on a different day) and removed her from me.

I stopped going there, but yesterday was my friends birthday, they wanted to be there, so I went, but since I&#39;m on a diet, I was only drinking shots because I&#39;m counting calories. 

I drank 16 shots and was still standing. I felt like I had had 4 beers. The shots all tasted very watered down. I went next door to TJ&#39;s, ordered the same shot, and POW! felt like a kick to the mouth.

They charged me 5 dollars a shot for watered-down booze. Thats the last straw. I need everyone to know.

I hope they go out of business or someone else buys the bar. thats outrageous."

Having a place that sold German fare is great since no other restaurant in Palatine provides that. Even as a vegetarian, I was able to find things on the menu I really enjoyed. Things quickly turned for the worst and I am glad to see there are new owners but other than keeping beer stocked, (which was a constant issue for the previous owner) the  atmosphere is rather dull, they still  have disgruntled employees that seem irritated with the manner things are run,  and the menu was slimmed considerably. The location and space is very nice, it just seems that they are falling short in a lot of little areas. Hope to see them spice up the place so it becomes more appealing."

The outside is inviting, and walking in a wave of sound washes over you.  On a Friday night it was packed at the bar.  This is not a huge place, but remodeled and very hip, replacing the old tired decor. Sitting in a booth at the back, we could watch all of the comings and goings without too much bar noise.  The menu is reasonably priced, with a great appetizer list of favorites and new interesting items.  A huge tall glass of german draft beer was only $5.00.  We ordered chicken schnitzel, with spaetzle, red cabbage, and ordered german potato salad and sauerkraut on the side.  The schnitzel was thin and crisp, two huge potions, but tender with a butter knife.  The kraut and potatoes were very tangy and good, and the spaetzle was Austrian style, thicker and made with a teaspoon by hand not a machine. Rich but delicious.  Can&#39;t wait to go back!"

I ordered there spicy seafood pasta special. It was linguini with muscles, clams, shrimp and fish.

One time several families ordered carryout together and were short one dish. We had a couple orders of that dish and plenty of dishes to share so it wasn&#39;t a big deal but the owner dropped it off at our back yard gathering anyway. Its not a delivery place but he delivered anyway.

One of the most embarrassing dinners that I have ever had and we were celebrating my 50th birthday on top of it. I moved into the area about a year ago and had been wanting to try this place as it was close to home. We walked into the restaurant and overheard someone say that someone was the owner, so I made it a point to introduce myself to the guy and tell him how I was excited to eat at his restaurant. We sat down and ordered wine and food. After my friend drank his first glass of wine, he ordered a second. When they brought it out, it did not taste like the same wine as the first. Please keep in mind that this is someone that never complains in all the times we have gone out over 20 years of friendship. The restaurant did good though and replaced the glass with one from a newly opened bottle. So far, so good. Then we got our entrees. I have a daughter who is autistic and while she loves Fettuccine Alfredo, if she sees black spots from pepper or if the pan is not clean, then she makes a fuss. I have learned to just coach the waiter in any restaurant as we order so usually it is not a problem but when her dish arrived, sure enough, there was black stuff all around. I tried to get her to eat it but it was a problem so I grabbed the waiter and talked to him. He took the dish back to the kitchen and came back 5 minutes later with what was either the same dish, stirred or a different dish with more black spots in it. As soon as it was set down, he noticed it, apologized and took the dish back again. Then he came back and said that the kitchen was unable to prepare an alfredo sauce that didn&#39;t have black spots in it but that the manager offered to comp the dish. Keep in mind that the dish was removed from our table uneaten so it was not like they did us any favor. Was there really a question if they were going to charge us? Then, the waiter asked about desert and this is where it got funny. When we said that we were interested in seeing the desert tray, he came back to the table and said that the owner must be having a bad day and sometimes gets an attitude and that between the complaints of the wrong wine and the alfredo, that he was refusing to let us have desert. At first, we were confused, then offended and as we were about to get up, the waiter came back and said that there was a mistake, that his boss had a heavy accent and that we were welcome to order desert. I have to believe that there was no mistake made and that the guy just had second thoughts about his actions as he made no effort to come himself to the table and as we eventually did leave, actually left the dining room in what appeared to be an attempt to avoid us. I will never go again, even though I could walk to the place."

Sam was singing Frank Sinatra soft tunes last night over dinner.  He did good singing the slow soft songs. My wife ordered the tilapia piccata. Her entre was excellent. Comes with soup or salad. She ordered a minestrone soup, and had broccoli instead of the side pasta. I had chicken marsala, it was just outstanding. The owner told me instead of white mushrooms he used a different mushroom. Probably the best I ever had. The waitress was nice also. Salad was chilled and good also.  This is a neighborhood gem."

I recently dined here on a Saturday night with friends.  The service was alright and the food was not bad. The entertainment began right about when we finished eating and were waiting for our check.  The entertainer came to our table and asked one of my friend&#39;s to participate in the show. While he was putting on his &#34;costume&#34; with other patrons, the owner came up to our table and told us that we were sitting there too long after paying the bill and that it was time we left.  We tried to tell him that we were only waiting for our friend and that we were planning to leave as soon as he returned back to the table.  This answer was not good enough.  We were told to leave immediately.  We picked up our coats and ended up standing by the bar for 10 minutes waiting for the rest of our party to finish &#34;performing&#34; a Beatles song. The restaurant was packed and I was totally embarrassed.  The frosting on the cake was that there was not one person waiting by the front door!  I could understand if they needed to make the table available for waiting customers, but there was not one person waiting! Do yourself a favor and save your money or take it somewhere they appreciate your business.  It&#39;s not here."

The atmosphere is very nice, relaxing and clean. (See picture). They have large storefront windows so the lighting made the place look really nice. We had the:

Minestrone Soup: Not bad,  tasted fine. (Came free with meal)

Funghi Ripieni: 4 button mushroom caps stuffed with a mix of  sausage, bread crumbs and cheese and topped with a cream sauce. There&#39;s also a little salad on the plate with it. I would say this dish is a little salty for my tastes and at 10.00 is too pricey for 4 stuffed mushrooms...maybe if they were stuffed Portobello&#39;s it&#39;d be worth it. 

Linguine Vongole (Red Sauce): 6 big clams and lots and lots of little clams. This dish was TOO DAMN SALTY! The portion was huge but the red sauce was really really watery. I would say at 18.00 this dish is worth the price for what you get if you like tomato seawater as pasta sauce. 

I would say that the best part about this place is the service. The people are really friendly and fast about getting you your food. My waiter kept refilling my tea when it was low without me even asking. 

The worst part about this place is that they will literally charge you 6 dollars to split an entree. That to me is a ridiculous cost just to put 1 dish on 2 plates. 

Overall I would say this place is not that great if you&#39;re a food focused diner. If you consider the ambiance and service very important then you might want to give it a try. 2 Stars for food, +1 Star for Service and Atmosphere, -1 star for crappy pricing.  

To give you some perspective on what I consider salty: I eat at Olive Garden and think it tastes just fine... so there ya go. 

Btw I posted pictures of the place and my dishes so check those out if you want to see what it looks like."

He had the ziti with crumbled sausage and peas - as another reviewer noted, there were peas aplenty and like her, if I try the dish I&#39;ll have to remember to order it without them. I ordered the gnocchi in vodka cream sauce and thought it was excellent. Sometimes cream sauces are way too rich - this was right on.

I plan to return to DiBenedetto&#39;s again - well worth the visit with or without a Groupon."

The service was embarrassingly atrocious!  From the time we ordered, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for our food to be served.  While we waited, our drinks were never refilled (even our water) nor did Bill, our server, ever check on us. The owners stood by fully aware of the situation; they did nothing.  One member of our party was so upset he left.  This was truly a painful dining experience.  When our food finally arrived at 9pm, the pasta was overcooked.  I didn&#39;t even need to chew.  YUCK!  We also waited FOREVER for the bill.  I&#39;m amazed Bill has a job."

Got there and decided to be seated in the quieter area since the entertainer was starting. Ordered a glass of their house wine and waiting for our house salad. It was obvious it came from a bag. It was lightly (and I mean lightly) drizzled with some balsamic vinaigrette and if it hadn&#39;t been for the blue cheese crumbles that we ordered on the side, it would&#39;ve been barely edible. We ordered lasagna and veal saltimbocca and then we waited and we waited and we waited. Probably about 30 minutes. When it finally came, the veal was very watery and the lasagna was simply slopped on the plate. Both meals tasted ok not terrific. Then we waited and waited and waited for our check. Finally had to get up and go to the hostess station and get it. $75 later we were out of there. It was painful to eat there."

There is a sign on the door that states you need to present any discount to the host. As I was telling him I had a discount through Yelp if I checked in, he interrupted me and started yelling no discounts tonight! I said ok, I don&#39;t like causing a scene and didn&#39;t say anything more, nothing like being embarrased in front of everyone. We were seated at our table and if I wasn&#39;t dining with friends who had invited us to dinner I would have left. Saying the service is slow is an understatement, we waited 45 minutes to order our dinner. The place was busy, but thats a bit much. I did manage to get one drink during that time, but that was all. Oh and bread, which was good. I had spaghetti with bolognese sauce, it was good but not worth waiting for as long as we did.

Where do I begin? The modern decor and immaculately crisp feeling when you walk thru the door is to die for! To me, ambiance makes a place! The owners are always there and never forget to warmly greet ALL their guests! The food,and the prices are OUTSTANDING! Vittorio will accommodate you any way he knows how,specifically preparing something different for you to your liking! We have eaten at many fine restaurants, pay top prices and still have yet to find one single place that has all this place has to offer! Reasonable,quality,freshly prepared and always a beautiful presentation! The mussels are great  AND huge like we like them. The stuffed mushrooms are the best I have ever had with &#34;crumbled&#34; SAUSAGE- HARD TO COME BY! Try the bolognese sauce, mouth watering! I love all his sauces. Salads are fresh and crisp (how many times do you get ridiculous wilted salads when you go out? Not here!) Wednesday night is $5 Martini-ladies night! Dance the night away here,fridays and Saturdays too...we dont miss many. Normally we sit at the bar as we like to socialize and have found many friends here each time we go.Lastly I should add Vittorio has the best entertainment anywhere! They are &#34;lively&#34; and &#34;fun&#34; and make the evening what it is! Any time we decide to stray and stop somewhere else for a quick meal we are always sorry! We live a ways from here but still close enough to make the drive last minute and we do so every chance we get! This is a great neighborhood spot and I must add, NO other Italian spot can compare!

My wife and I are African American. They sat us in a room where no one else was eating (away from the fun atmosphere). We told the waitress we had a groupon and she said OK. We ordered our food and ate our food. We gave them the groupon and then owner came out yelling at us and calling us names and said he would not honor our group on. He said we would have to pay full price. We were not about to do that. He said he would call the police and my wife told him to go right ahead. The police arrived and did nothing.

I do not mind paying a premium for excellent service and courteous service and historically, I have received it at this location. I know how Woodfield mall gets on a Saturday night. I know how popular restaurants get on a Saturday night. It&#39;s either reservati...on or 1+ hours waiting. 

However, this time my experience was different. I called on Friday, September 30, 2016 at 2:02PM to make reservations for Saturday, October 1. The female that picked up the phone that day (I don&#39;t recall her name) asked what time I would like my reservation for. I said anytime between 7:30PM-8:00PM. She stated she had a 7:30 P.M. slot and took my information down. 

I show up on October 1 with an empty stomach and a date. I walked in and spoke with the host Shargene Zangana who said he was unable to find my reservation. I stated that I called ahead the day prior and made a reservation. His response? &#34;I have to go with what the system says.&#34; I showed him my outgoing call to his phone number for the restaurant, and he said, &#34;I have to go with what is in the system.&#34; No apology, no digging into finding out what happened to the reservation, nothing. I looked at the people ahead of me and knew the &#34;walk-in&#34; wait was going to be long. Peak hours on a Saturday night, I get it. He said he would seat us as soon as he can and would give us a phone call. I asked for a timeframe, he said he couldn&#39;t give me one. I asked him to ball park the wait time, he said he could not give me an estimated time. 
So me and my date sat (though I was stewing a bit) at the bar and waited for over an hour and 10 minutes. All of the &#34;walk-ins&#34; that walked in with us had already been seated for quite some time. Everyone else had those pager/buzzer devices I noticed, but we did not. So I asked Shargene how much longer it would be, and he said another 30-45 minutes with the smuggest look on his face. Like it was somehow pleasing to him that I had to wait longer.

Now I get that if I was a regular walk-in, that type of wait was expected. But I MADE RESERVATIONS! Who messed up? I don&#39;t know. System? Worker? It&#39;s not my place to figure it out, it&#39;s theirs. So I askd for a manager, albeit angrily. And he smugly replied that he was the manager. I was floored and knew that I would get nowhere with him. Shargene never offered one apology for the inconvenience and probably assumed I was lying about even having a reservation. My name isn&#39;t difficult, it&#39;s Mike Smith I called on Friday, Sept 30 at 2:02 PM and spoke with a female call taker if anyone cares to research this further. I asked for his card and dined elsewhere after terse words. 

I worked in customer service for 6 years and currently serve my community as a public servant. I would NEVER treat anyone like that. It was so infuriating, and I let Shargene know, but he would not even look up from his computer after awhile. He should not be the face of this great restaurant. I had to share my experience. Will I go back? I might. Though I will likely call twice and make 2 reservations to increase the likelihood of a successful one. 

Disappointedly, 

Mike"

We were seated in a cramped table up a against a light post and I asked to switch. If I&#39;m paying $100 for dinner we want to be comfortable. The waiter gave us attitude for wanting to switch. 

The next waiter though was friendly and all the guys cutting up the meat were more then friendly. Everything was tender and flavorful though some cuts were salty. Id skimp on the salad bar and go big on the meat. They were nice enough to give us a free birthday desert and even use a $25 off coupon. We will be back."
texas-de-brazil-schaumburg,Damian C.,40WBjYAjbYsWE8CsggWkwg,"Columbus, IN",1,1,1,125,57,qrFNGi5KWAjauDhg9vzQfQ,5.0,2016-05-26,"My birthday was on May 10th, a weekday, a Tuesday....who wants to celebrate on a busy day like that???!! I decided to make plans to visit one of my favorite cities, Chicago. My choice was to go to Texas de Brazil..a Brazilian Churrascaria. 

Doing some research, I noticed that they only had 2 locations....one in Chicago and one in Schaumburg, IL. The one in Chicago is no longer in business. I was sent a certificate for 25 bucks off in my e-mail and knew that it only made sense to go there!! 

This location in Schaumburg is located as a storefront attached to the Woodfield Mall. It is right next to P.F. Changs. Entering the restaurant, I noticed the ambience was a rather dark setting, but elegant. There was a reason for it&#39;s darkness ....haha. They had candles on every table, and they were fake lit candles. The bar sits directly to your left as you walk in, and you know that normally a bar is dark anyways. The lighting consisted of different colors that were classy and nice. 

At the table, the napkins are folded fancy, blue glasses and clear glasses filled the table and added a nice touch to the dinner I was about to enjoy. After the waiter asked for my drink choice, I asked if there were free refills. I pretty much already knew the answer, and he told me only for Iced tea and tap water. Ewwww...not a fan of Iced tea, and definitely do not like water from the tap. 

I got up and feasted my eyes on the beast of a salad bar!!! I wanted to instantly have it placed in my home to enjoy everyday. The cucumbers, to the grape tomatoes, the onion mix of vidalia and red onions...they were all marinated, of what seemed like a light italian marinade. It was a perfect salad bar. So many choices of cheeses, meats, veggies...you name it, they had it!! They also had an actual parmesan wheel, with CHUNKS of parmesan!!! I was in heaven! 

After I took my volcano of salad to the table, you have a little coaster-like medallion that you flip over on green, meaning you want meat to come to your table, and red if you want to hold off for a bit. They also bring to your table, these delicious parmesan puffs, and fried plantains marinated in a cinnamon sauce. I couldn&#39;t believe what happened after flipping the coaster to green. It was like being the King of Brazil with all of your gaucho&#39;s swarming you with steel rods of roasted and grill meats that they slice off for you. You have little tongs to have hold onto the meat as they slice it for you. They are wearing Brazilian attire, with the leather boots and shreds of leather around them...forgive me because I don&#39;t know the name of their attire.

I was intrigued by the customer service of the server, the gaucho&#39;s.....everyone was so nice and attentive, almost too attentive. I had filet mignon, bacon wrapped filet and normal, flank steak, garlic steak, parmesan chicken, parmesan crusted pork, leg of lamb, lamn chop.....I just can&#39;t name them all. So many pieces of flavorful meat!! I used to be a guy who only liked well done beef, but I tried medium-well, medium, and accidentally rare!!! I&#39;m never going back to well done again!!! I was missing out on the true flavor of steak. Can you believe I almost spit out the well done piece I got by mistake afterwards....LOL!! It felt good to break out of my comfort zone....SO GOOD!! I do note that accidentally eating rare, was a bit much for me because of the bloody taste, but medium and medium well was perfect!!

The meat was so delicious!! So manu different Brazilian spices for the meat, and each had their own spices.... They did have sausages too but I didn&#39;t try them. Everything was perfect, and I do wish they had refills on soft drinks other than tea. I was in such carnivore heaven, and I know the vegetarians deemed me to hell, but this is when you feel like heaven can wait...I mean, it&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t make them happy too by having a salad, LOL...

If you want to try Brazilian food. Go to Texas de Brazil!!! It&#39;s a little pricey, but every once in a great while would be great!! If you can find one near you, go!!! If there isn&#39;t, then I suggest you travel, lol!! You will thank me later. Think about it....it&#39;s like eating tons of Brazilian food without leaving the country!! Be your own King or Queen, and indulge in this AMAZING Brazilian Steakhouse!!!!!"

Most of my experience here has been for business luncheons, and there food is consistently good.  I appreciate that the establishment never rushes customers out.  The salad bar is one of the best I&#39;ve had.  Meat is well trimmed.  Dinner provides more meat options.  We had slightly disappointing service on Mother&#39;s Day (slow!!!),  but this was an isolated experience.  It seems best to avoid peak hours and holidays."

We went there last night (on 11/21/16) and we absolutely have nothing but bad experience of last night. This is so sad to say. It was my Dad&#39;s 65th birthday - and this is one of his favorite places to dine in at. We had these gift certificates from when we donated to St. Jude&#39;s - we donated a lot because of the purchasing night, the manager had told us that we could use it whenever before the expiration date (understandable) but what he also mentioned was that we were able to use all gift certificates at the same time because we donated so much. We called ahead to make reservations and also asked the host on the phone if we could still use the certificates all at one time for this evening dinner, she said yes. Well last night the manager (David) working did not accommodate us for any means because it says you can only use 4 of these certificates. Now, for anyone who has worked in an industry and you are reading this knows that any manager on site at the time can make exceptions to anything; discounts for a birthday, discounts for a child&#39;s dinner, taking a dessert off a bill, etc. This was so embarrassing because my Mother came into the restaurant knowing by 2 people that she could use all these certificates at one time, brought money for the rest of the bill and the tip (server would have gotten a large tip). Because there were 5 of us plus 2 kids under 4years old. How can the manager not be able to split checks or even accept these gift certificates? He was really unprofessional in talking with us about rejecting the gift certificates and talking to us in general. How was he able to discount the kid&#39;s meals and take out a dessert for my Father&#39;s birthday, but not able to accept these certificates (we had $70 worth of gift certificates)? We ended up using gift cards and splitting payment for the end of the night. We have never been unsatisfied with service or food there, until last night. I&#39;d like to talk to someone else that was not the manager of last night (David)."

With that said I would still recommend trying this place. My husband (carnivore) loved it. I loved the salad bar, lots to choose from. I don&#39;t eat red meat anymore so waiting for the chicken or pork meats to come to the table was very piecemeal for me. I did try a piece of chicken wrapped in bacon, very good. A piece of pork tenderloin, very good, and a chicken drumette it was ok. Tasted like shake and bake chicken to me. After that I decided to go back to the salad bar. I was much happier with that. I would come here again, next time I would probably skip the meat and stick with the salad bar. If you are considering this restaurant just keep in mind it really isn&#39;t a great value if you aren&#39;t a huge meat eater. It is a fixed price menu.

We found the place to have a quite colorful and festive dining atmosphere and in that respect it was more upbeat dining here than say at Fogo de Chao (still a favorite churrascaria for us).  Lunch meat selections were notably a bit more limited though, but what they did have was all excellent as one might expect.   For example, no lamb chops and no filet mignon&#39;s at lunchtime.   Also noteworthy was the cream of jalapeno soup of the day which was quite nice and only mildly spicy.  If you&#39;re looking for a churrasco meal you can&#39;t go wrong by coming here, and particularly if looking for something on the festive side."

After our horrendous experience at the Rosemont Fogo, we decided to try Texas for the first time, and it was AMAZING!!

What I enjoyed the most was the sheer variety. I enjoyed the salad bar here way more, and greatly appreciated the soup they had available (lobster bisque), and as other Yelpers before me have mentioned, the chimichurri is a MUST.

My favorite item was the garlic picanha. DH thoroughly enjoyed the beef ribs. N00b that I am, I had to give him my portion as the meat was too rich for me.  The meats here were definitely more robust in flavor than what I&#39;ve previously had at all of the Fogos I&#39;ve been to. Although we were sat by the window with the not so romantic fluorescent glow of the mall&#39;s lights emanating through the curtain-less windows, what was on our plates more than made up for it. 

I&#39;m definitely a fan! Oh! And sign up for the mailing list if you&#39;re a first time visitor. We saved $25 off by opting to dine on a Friday night (coupon not valid Saturdays)."

The service was impeccable. The food was delicious. The salad bar was exquisite. In fact, I hate to call it a salad bar as that name doesn&#39;t sufficiently describe it. From the sun dried tomatoes, fresh parmesean to the lobster bisque soup, it was amazing. The meats served were all cooked and seasoned to perfection. 

What sets this apart from Fogo in Indy (I&#39;m addition to the expanded salad bar selections and slightly better taste to the meats) was the service. On this crazy busy Saturday (did I forget to mention that this location is attached to the humongous Woodfield Mall?), the servers, the hosts (the gentlemen that stand throughout the restaurant to make sure things are flowing) made sure we were served and just taken care of!

This is one place to definitely go to for your protein fix! They do have a good salad bar-love the smoked salmon and croissants, but don&#39;t let it distract you from the opportunity of having plate after plate of fine cut meats-pork, sirloin, chicken, lamb chop, and sausage with the power of a circle card on one side colored GREEN(Yes, Please) and on the other flip side RED(No, Thank You). I highly recommend going on weekends where they have a Brunch option, which includes a free dessert!

For dinner they bring grilled meats on skewers to the table. Filet mignon, beef ribs (not on a skewer), lamb chops, top sirloin, chicken parmesan, garlic sirloin, I don&#39;t recall the rest. They also bring cheesy bread rolls, fried bananas, and mashed potatoes to the table.

But this is my problem. I have been going to this location for some time now. Gone on both lunch and dinner. But it seems lately, the quality has gone down. Could it be hey are finally burnt out? I hope not. The meats were not seasoned nor tasted like they normally did. The house sirloin was not good. The flank steak was so blah. The fillet wrapped in bacon was ehhhhh. My last visit there was to the point I could not triple down on my meat. I was forced to top off at the salad bar and at the table fried bananas. 

Now, because I have a soft spot for this place, I will be going back again. I hope their quality and care improves or I might have to start looking elsewhere for my unlimited steak cravings."

Our waiter and the gauchos were nice, but not very attentive. I had to request for the top sirloin (their signature meat) to be brought to us at the end of our meal since they were not circulating it. The meats were good quality, but they needed to circulate the steak dishes more--they kept sending the cheaper meats our way (repeatedly for some of them) while we waited for what we had yet to try to come by. The salad bar was one of the best I&#39;ve had at a Brazilian steakhouse, and I loved that I could get as much pineapple as I wanted, although I did really miss the grilled pineapple dusted with cinnamon that I&#39;ve had at ever other Brazilian steakhouse I&#39;ve been to. We went for my birthday, and when the waiter presented deserts at the end of the meal, it sounded like they were included (which I assumed was likely considering many restaurants give you a comped desert on your birthday). We were too full to have desert there, so we asked for creme brulee to go. To our surprise, we were charged for desert (which was way more expensive than expected), and to add insult to the wallet injury, we discovered that there was no caramelized sugar on our creme brulee after we got home. For the obscene amount they charge, desert should have been included, and whoever is in charge of deserts should know that creme brulee is not creme brulee without the caramelized sugar.

I&#39;d be willing to try this place again for lunch, or if we had a decent discount, but I will never go back for a full-price dinner."

Went for my wife&#39;s birthday with my two kids on a Saturday night. I stopped in on Wednesday before that to ask if the birthday coupons were good for Saturday, and the hostess told me, rather rudely, no. After scrutinizing the coupon and seeing that it does not state anywhere that Saturdays are prohibited, I called and talked to a manager, who said they do indeed honor  coupons on Saturday, so apparently the hostess I talked to first had no clue. 

Despite being early for our reservation, on Saturday, the hostess gave us a buzzer and we sat waiting for 15 minutes. When I finally reminded her that we were waiting (and they had a myriad of empty tables), she apologized and said there was some confusion and then seated us. The waiter came around to get our drinks soon after we sat, but that was pretty much the last time we saw him- he spent most of his time taking care of the table adjacent to us, making them drinks at the table, etc. Which meant that our freebie mashed potatoes and fried bananas never got refilled. 

The food was fine but we asked at least two servers to send the lamb chops server to us. When he still didn&#39;t arrive near the end of our meal, I had to literally stand up and flag him down to come to our table (my daughters LOVES lamb chops). Finally I asked to see the manager, who was patronizing and rude when we complained about the wait and our waiter ignoring us. The manager went to check with the hostesses and then came back to our table to say they have a random computer glitch sometimes and basically, according to the hostess computer, it was like we didn&#39;t exist. We would have probably sat there forever if I hadn&#39;t reminded her we were there. The manager apologized but didn&#39;t extend the apology further to rectify the horrible service we&#39;d received thus far. After that, a multitude of servers came to our table, even though our cards were flipped over to red at that point, so it turned out to just be annoying. One server asked, also in a patronizing tone, if we&#39;d gotten our lamb chops. Our waiter finally returned to refill our potatoes and bananas, but again, we were so irritated by everyone being rude to us that it didn&#39;t matter at that point. Too little, too late.

And the worst part? The bathrooms were DISGUSTING! Toilet paper sitting on the bar instead of hung up, the automatic toilets didn&#39;t flush and... think of the grossest thing you can think of to be on the women&#39;s bathroom floor. Yes, my wife and daughter spotted that next to the toilet. My wife and I used to frequent there a lot, but we hadn&#39;t been in a few years. Needless to say, we will never be going back there again!"

The overall look was so welcoming and luxurious. Beautiful flowers decorated the restaurant. We started with the brunch buffet which was more than enough---if they never came around with the meat it was a beautiful delicious feast. Shrimp, cheeses, prosciutto, lobster bisque, fruit, vegetables, salads, breads, olives, and that&#39;s just what i remember! Then came those lovely giant skewers of meat. I tried literally a bite or two of each. Amazing--everything. Garlic steak, bacon wrapped chicken, lamb chop and sausage are what really stood out for me. I chose the creme brulee for dessert---biggest creme brulee I ever had. Yummy--

Came here Sunday night with Kelly &amp; her mom to celebrate her mom&#39;s birthday.  Her mom had always wanted to try this place.  I sure as heck wasn&#39;t about to say no to going out for bottomless meat on stick!   We had reservations at 6.  We showed up at 6 but only had to wait a few minutes for our table.  

The decor inside is darker woods, colors, etc.  A bit more intimate feeling than the other churascarias we&#39;ve been to.  Our waiter, through a thick but intelligible accent, came over &amp; explained the premise to Kelly&#39;s mom and took our drink order.  I also had asked if they have a menu so she would have an idea of the variety of meats they offered.  That menu was brought out within a minute.  

The ladies ordered some alcoholic beverages while I just had water the whole night, wanting to save room for meat and not liquid. They said their drinks were very good. Our water glasses never got below half full, which was great. 

The ladies hit the salad bar while I table-sat/purse-sat.  They came back with full plates.  I went to the salad bar &amp; while there were a lot of tasty looking options, I didn&#39;t come away with much from it. Some smoked salmon, olives, cheese, etc.  While we enjoyed ate our salad bar offerings, they brought out their biscuits, mashed potatoes and fried plantains.  The biscuits were good, but sweeter &amp; doughier than I was expecting.  I refrained from the mashed potatoes as starch would fill me up.  The fried plantains....well...lets just say they couldnt bring them out often enough.  Between Kelly &amp; I alone, we probably had 8-10 of &#39;em.  Outstanding!  Lightly fried with hint of brown sugar, cinnamon, etc.  MMMMMMMMMM.  Oh, if they&#39;d only  been served over vanilla ice cream....

As far as the meats.  they claimed to have 12 or so different meat options available.  We probably only saw 7-8 of the 12....but those 7-8 were excellent!  Food was perfectly seasoned for my tastes and usually piping hot!  We probably saw the filet mignon gaucho  and the bacon wrapped filet gaucho 4-5 times each &amp; who am I to turn both away?!  Picanha (sirloin), parmesan chicken drumsticks and parmesan pork loin were all excellent as well.   After I had tapped out with the meat sweats about to commence,  I honestly didn&#39;t miss the other meats but it would&#39;ve been nice to have them come by.  

The waiter asked if we wanted to see dessert.  I said no.  Kelly ordered some coconut pie. Kelly&#39;s mom said no as well &amp; the waiter, who was outstanding through the whole night, was very fun &amp; giving her grief about not having birthday dessert.  A few minutes later, the waiter brought out the pie, but the plate had Happy Birthday written on it with a candle and an extra fork for Kelly&#39;s mom.  A very nice  and welcome touch.   
 

LOVE this place!!  Been here a few times now &amp;, to me, it&#39;s THE BEST churrascaria of them all in the Chicagoland  area!  Service, both wait staff, bus boys &amp; water boys, were all outstanding.  The place is clean and well decorated to my liking.  The only minor dings I have were I wasn&#39;t blown away with the salad bar &amp; we didn&#39;t see all the meat gauchos, but those are minor deductions.  Can&#39;t wait to go back again....once these meat sweats have stopped!  ;)"

Texas de Brazil continues to be one of my favorite Brazilian steakhouses in the Chicagoland area. After a disappointing meal at Fogo de Chao in Rosemont, we made up for it by booking a table at TdB the following weekend. Almost everything was better here...there was actually shrimp and sushi at the market table, lobster bisque soup - and the sides of cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and bananas were countless times more delicious here. The only negative was no polenta. Now onto the meats...at first service was very slow. It seemed like every gaucho passed up our table. I complained to our waiter and then we had a flood of gauchos stopping by! I had everything from lamb chops (my favorite of the night), to the house sirloin, to filet mignon, to beef ribs... everything was tender, everything was seasoned well, and I was stuffed to the gills by the end of the meal. No room for dessert - that&#39;s how it should be!

So why the 4 star? First, they didn&#39;t acknowledge my birthday, even though I told them when I made the reservation. Also, the service was definitely not as attentive here as Fogo. At Fogo, the servers work as a team, so literally anyone that was free would stop over.  It got a little confusing there because we didn&#39;t know who to ask for what, but I&#39;d rather get more attention than not enough. At TdB, we found that it could take awhile for our server to get back to our table, so things like bread, bananas, and water were not refilled right away - and we actually had to flag him down to ask.  Hopefully next time service would be better, but still overall, a very solid performance!"

The meat is seasoned well (nice and salty, just the way I like it), the salad bar is huge, and it&#39;s decently priced.

First it&#39;s the food, I love the way the meat is seasoned and it tastes great.  I&#39;ve been to other churrascarias and I&#39;ve found their meat to be somewhat bland... Not a problem here at TdB.  The roasting area where they cook the meat is open for everyone to see and you can see the guys salting the meat as they cook it.  Some personal favorites are the flank steak, lamb chops, house special (u shaped meat, I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called...) and the beef ribs.  I never see the beef ribs around, so you may have to ask for it.

The salad bar is also huge and they have many options including soup!  I love their lobster bisque, and their fluffy airy dinner rolls go well with it.  There are also some other cooked items on the salad bar, but you don&#39;t want to fill up on those and not have enough room for the meat.  So TdB... I see what you did there...

It&#39;s $50 for dinner and I think $35 for lunch.  If you join their email club you&#39;ll get specials for your birthday and get notified when they have coupons for a cheaper dinner price.  I mean at $50 it&#39;s a great deal, but at $40 or less?  it&#39;s a phenomenal deal.

However, he&#39;d been here before and I had not.  Since it was my first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse, I&#39;d have to say that I enjoyed it.  Although, I was definitely more full than I&#39;ve ever been before!  When our server explained the process to me about flipping the little circle on your table from green (if you want more meat) to red (if you don&#39;t want any more meat), it all made sense.  I will say that all the meat I tasted was phenomenal... well seasoned, good temperature, fresh, and tasty.  I loved the filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, chicken breast wrapped in bacon, parmesan pork, flank steak the most, but there were 13 different kinds of meat to choose from.  I tried them all.  

The salad bar was very nice, lots to pick from including different side dish items, soups, salad garnishes, etc.  All very fresh too, just wish more of the items were labels... only some of them were.  Every table gets a side dish of fried bananas and mashed potatoes.  I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the bananas, but the mashed potatoes were good.  We tried their signature drink called a Caipirinha and ended up sending it back because it was way too strong for us and very sweet.  The server described it as a Brazilian mojito made with rum.  Although we both tried ours, our server did not charge us for it which was nice.  We did order the red sangria after that and enjoyed it.  

I highly recommend asking for Raul as your server!  He was so well trained when it came to describing the menu, had good suggestions for drinks and side items and was very professional and courteous.  We also had dessert, I had the creme brulee and my hubby tried the Brazilian papaya cream.  I&#39;ve had better creme brulee, mine was cold in the middle which told me it was pre-made and then heated, but not all the way through.  The flavor was just ok.  My hubby said the papaya cream just tasted like frozen papaya flavored yogurt.  He said it was also ok.  Won&#39;t order those again.  I&#39;m sure we will come back again in the future.  Maybe not right away as we&#39;re still trying to work off all the calories from this very large meal! ;)  

*Suggestion... make sure you&#39;re really hungry when you go here.  Do NOT eat before hand!"

Let me just say upfront, for $50 a person, I will start going to wildfire or one of the other nice steak houses in the area.  

The premise of a Brazilian steakhouse is that you have an all you can eat type of meal. They keep bringing small portions of meat to your table.

Tonight, I only had four tiny pieces. I would say each piece was about one ounce. I had a piece of sirloin steak. The server with the sirloin never returned to our table. Not once.  I also had two small pieces of garlic steak. It was a little tough but not too garlicky.  It wasn&#39;t a higher quality cut of meat. I also had one pork rib. 

Our server came by three times and ask if there was anything that we would like.   Each time I told him that I would like beef. The only time the beef was ever brought to our table again was a beef rib.  Three times I asked and that was all we ever had. 

They did bring the sausages many times, Parmesan chicken, etc. however, I don&#39;t go to a Brazilian steakhouse, pay $50, for pieces of Parmesan chicken or sausages. 

Beautiful restaurant. Just not worth it.  Take my advice and go to a nice steakhouse and get a higher quality of meat for the same price."

We went again this weekend, and the experience was superb.  We were seated past the salad bar area right next to the window of the grilling kitchen.  We enjoyed watching the meats get prepped.  Our server gave excellent service, asking if we were celebrating any event.  It was my dad&#39;s birthday; later there was a cute scoop of ice cream with a lit candle presented to him.  More than once, we were asked if we were wanting any particular meats - my dad got his lamb twice and I got my picahna (top sirloin) twice.  As always, the lobster bisque was awesome and worth a second bowl.  In my last review, I did say I would never eat lamb again, but I did try the leg of lamb again and decided it was juicy and tender and only a little gamey.  I sort of enjoyed it."

Food gluttony at its finest. It was so good, I stopped taking pictures - I was too busy eating.

Texas de Brazil sits on the upper level of Woodfield Mall near the Sears entrance. The place is enormous, and was pretty packed for the high price. But, the cost is well worth the quality of the food and the service.

Like other Brazilian Steakhouses I&#39;ve been to, this one has a wonderful, amazing salad bar that is included with the meal. And the meal itself consists of a variety of skewered meats - various steak and beef items, chicken, lamb and sausage. They serve a few side orders - mashed potatoes, cheese bread and fried bananas. Honestly, I can&#39;t find fault with anything. Everything we ate was wonderful.

The salad bar consists of the normal things you would expect. But, there are also several anti-pasta items like porchetta and prosciutto. They have hearts of palm, grilled pineapple, smoked salmon, pickled onions, sauteed mushrooms. There is a hot part of the salad bar with rice, beans, a soup of the day (lobster bisque), who kinds of potato salads. They also had bacon bits that were cooked along with the meats. There were also several home-made dressings that were from out of this world. I started my meal by purposely overeating on the salad bar. I wanted to limit the meat.

You could easily eat your worth at the salad bar, but that just wouldn&#39;t be right. The meats are outstanding. Like other Brazilian Steakhouses, they have a medallion on the table by your place setting - red on one side meaning stop, green on the other side meaning - bring me meat. Let&#39;s see - we tried Brazilian sausages, top roast, beef ribs (from out of this world), filet wrapped in bacon, top sirloin, skirt steak, they offer chicken legs and bacon wrapped chicken, and they offer leg of lamb and lamb chops. In my opinion, you can&#39;t go wrong with the lamb chops, the bacon wrapped filet, the sausages and the beef ribs. They also have two Parmesan crusted meats, but I can&#39;t have milk products, so I avoided them.

That was the clincher for me in giving them the fifth star. I mentioned the milk allergy to the waitress. She brought the chef to the table, who walked me through everything they served. Then, he gave me a tour of the salad bar, pointing out which items I could have and which I could not have. He also showed me the deserts, but said they were all made with milk. He let me know he would make a fruit salad if I wanted desert.

The surprise for me at the dinner was he made roast potatoes for me, since the mashed potatoes had butter in them. Neither could I eat the cheese rolls, but that was fine. The bananas were outrageous!

We did have a few drinks, coffees and espressos before the meal was over. Everything about this place was the best. $$$$ is too much for a regular place, but for a special meal - this place is the bomb,"

Our experience started out horrendously. Firstly, parking was a nightmare. We drove around for about five minutes without finding any spaces so ended up doing valet which was $8; there was even a 5-minutes wait for the valet. We arrived about 5 minutes before our 4 pm reservation and we were given a pager saying it would be about 5 minutes until we got seated. After we waited for 10 minutes and watched 3 sets of people who also had reservations get seated without being given a pager, I went to the hostess desk to complain and we were seated right away. There was another couple in the same situation who had already complained to the manager. Once we were taken to a table, we asked to switch as we were seated next to a giant column in a high-traffic area. After that, the manager came over to apologize for getting off to a rocky start. His being proactive was much appreciated and, frankly, the only reason I am giving a 3-star review instead of a 2. The salad bar was small and the tomatoes were a little pink (a pet peeve of mine). My husband enjoyed the seafood and I liked the jasmine rice (nice to have additional side options!). The meat was just okay - some overcooked and some undercooked - but the service was great and they came by frequently. Overall, I&#39;d say skip this one. There are other chains that are the same price but have better food."

Way too noisy from everyone at the mall coming in and way too crowded. Because of this, the service feels like its very rushed and that they are just trying to turn tables and get more people seated. 
Food = the salad bar had ok options, nothing compared to what Fugu De Chao offers when you go to their Brazilian steakhouse. Same thing with the steak options, I believe there were only 5-6 different steak/meat options that came around. Defiantly could use some more. The only thing that stood out was the cocktails, there were amazing and well worth $12 a cocktail depending on what you like."

I came here with my family on my birthday for the Sunday brunch. Reservations are very smooth because they use Open Table and we were immediately seated with a really awesome waiter who explained everything to us! Although the website says to dress business casual, I saw  some jeans, t-shirts, and shorts so they must be quite lenient about that. But the interior is gorgeously fancy and overwhelming so you may stand out in the crowd of dressed up people. The concept is pretty self-explanatory. Flip the card to green for the meat carvers to come to you and red is to stop service. Everything not meat is at a self-serve buffet, which has a ton of options. You are also very welcome to take pictures and the carvers are cool about posing.

The lobster bisque is phenomenal! It&#39;s very creamy and is a great side. My mom found it a bit salty for her taste, but I really liked it. The palm hearts have a crunchy texture that releases a sweet and salty juice when you eat it. It&#39;s something neat to try! The buffet attendants are very efficient at keeping it all clean and refilled. I&#39;m especially thankful for them because everyone kept devouring the fresh mozzarella balls, which were absolutely amazing. Their smoked salmon is also really good and it has a light, smokey flavor on a crispy exterior and a succulent, juicy interior. I like to eat it with the au gratin potatoes and Brazilian potato salad. The servers also dropped off at our table mashed potatoes and fried bananas. I wished I asked for more fried bananas because they were soooo yummy.

For the meat, there were hundreds of people eating so it was hard to get a carver to notice our table. We did enjoy sampling all the beef options very much. They cook them to varying degrees and you can select which cut you want. I especially enjoyed the cute waiter handling the juiciest roast beef I&#39;ve ever had. I also liked the filet mignon and sirloin wrapped in bacon. I found the pork to be too salty for my taste. The chicken is fantastic and I&#39;m not sure what they did, but those were the juiciest thighs ever.

I adore the complimentary brunch dessert. The waiter brought us a fake dessert tray to show us our options. I ordered the creme brulee and my parents got the tuxedo cake and the cheesecake. The creme brulee was beautiful and perfectly made. The sugar crust beautifully cracked to reveal a creamy custard underneath. I was stuffed but found room to savor it. 

I docked off one star because some of the meats were very salty and they should work on that. Also, the meat servers sometimes didn&#39;t notice our green tabs and didn&#39;t come by at all much to our dismay. Perhaps they should remedy that by getting little stands that stick the signs in the air rather than putting them flat on the table.

Overall, the meal for three ran over $100, but it&#39;s definitely worth it and I hope to come back soon!

Side note: my dad really liked the Brazilian beer the waiter suggested. I don&#39;t drink but I found it to be very fragrant. I think it&#39;s called Palma?? Give it a shot! (Ha get it? Alcohol pun.)"

That being said, I found this Brazilian steakhouse to be a bust for me. Our server would rush around us, everytime he came to the table he would sputter out his words and take off. I found the staff to not be very attentive. We were a party of two and then another table came after us with a party of 7 and were given more attentive service. I felt as though the meats were slow coming, I felt passed up a lot of the times and the meat offered were the cheap cuts. The salad cheese seemed to be a lower quality compared to their competition. The cheese rolls were as hard as golf balls, and they dont serve fried polenta. I do have to say their lobster bisque was amazing. All in all it was a big disapointment and a shame, because I am a big fan of Brazilian steak houses and had been wanting to try others to see how they stacked up to my favorite standby. This is my first and last time here. Much better food and service at Fogo De Chao and Chama Gaucha."

I went for the first time and the food was really impressive!!
I had some really good couscous that I seriously want right now.
So much to choose from and sample it&#39;s almost hard to eat 2nds of anything because trying a little bit of everything is a lot of food! I tried almost all the meats and to be honest the thing I liked the least was the chicken?!? It tasted undercooked so I left it on my plate and moved on to the next meat. I had some mixed drink in coconut that was small but wow did it pack a punch! 
I do think it&#39;s a little pricy but I personally didn&#39;t eat and eat and eat like some people probably do. 
I recommend that if you go on a Saturday you make reservations. We almost weren&#39;t able to eat because they said we had to be done by a specific time, but we were able to work it all out.

You were a novelty when we first met years ago. You know, back when you used to offer free meals for birthdays and awesome discounts on holidays. I&#39;ve had some of the most enjoyable times cruising around your salad bar, devouring those spicy shrimp and the best potato salad that I&#39;ve had since Hawaii. I was impressed with your unlimited meat offerings and didn&#39;t mind that you were on the pricier side because I thought that the value was there. 

But then I discovered that I am really more of a hole-in-the-wall kinda girl and that I can get good quality, sometimes quantity, and definitely value at other places. That takes nothing away from the beauty that is your salad bar, or the flank steak that I always, unabashadly ask for seconds on.  So you&#39;ve got the big things covered: awesome food, including desserts (I already miss your cheesecake), nice ambiance, fast gauchos, and a pretty sweet deal for brunch. But it&#39;s the little things that I miss. 

Like your service, which has become, frankly, hit or miss. Everyone is usually pretty attentive until they see that we are not going to drink alcohol and then sometimes I&#39;m left chewing on left over ice while I see our server(s) paying more attention to other tables.  Plus, my BFF is a vegetarian and your website said that to ask about special vegetarian options; we did and the server simply pointed back to the salad bar from where we had just come. Earlier this year, you were still offering mimosas with brunch (per your website) and your server kept insisting it was $2. Your manager told us that he had to honor it because it was still on the website. I can see that it&#39;s gone now. 

When I made the reservations and you asked if I was celebrating anything and I advised about the birthday on the day of the reservation, I would have thought a &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; from someone would have come into play at some point. And the bacon wrapped filet mignon has been consistently dry the last several times. 

Apparently, having celebrated several birthdays and a bunch of gift certificates three times in the last couple of months, I am your current Yelp Duchess. But I probably won&#39;t be for long. That&#39;s okay. I shouldn&#39;t be frequenting buffets with unlimited meat offerings so often anyway. And It&#39;s probably just my personality, but when I&#39;m paying a minimum of $35 a head just for brunch, I want to be 100% happy about my experience. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see each other again someday, just not any time soon."

The seating was the last table before entering the salad bar area. Though I didn&#39;t care too much for that arrangement, I let it slide. It was a Saturday night, and though our reservations were for 530 we still had to wait a while to be accomodated. Again, let it slide since it&#39;s a Saturday night, busy and a reputed establishment. Meh, no big deal. 

The experience started with our server, who was extraordinary the entire way through. He was courteous, very helpful in recommendations as well, as we had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse prior to that day. It was just the 2 of us, and the waiters/servers came around consistently (but not bothersome) to offer us more selections of their succulent menu.  The drinks at the end that the server recommended to us were advertised as helping us to calm the overwhelmingly &#34;full&#34; feeling we had, and it worked!!! It&#39;s a small shot, but goes down heavy. 

Overall there were a couple things let slide, since it was nothing significant or catastrophic to our evening. The real great experience came from our server and the effort of the staff. Will definitely be back!!"

Love the salad bar, very fresh and had some Italian influences, offering items like delicious boconccini mozzarella, pesto, tomatoes (caprese salad anyone?) smoked salmon and prosciutto. I&#39;m a big fan of the house made orange glaze sauce that accompanies the asparagus. 

I usually inform my waiter ahead of time to tell the servers not to bother coming by my table if the meat isn&#39;t cooked medium rare. My favorite are the lamb chops and bacon wrapped filet (dinner only) and picanha (garlic sirloin).

The staff here are extremely nice and attentive. Absolutely outstanding service.

Hint:  During weekdays lunch is $25 and salad bar only is $20.00 (pretty good deal). You&#39;ll pay a premium for dining during the weekends."

This place treats you like a king from the very get go. Our dedicated server came and started explaining to is how things went as it was my first time and the best part was that once we told the server that we didn&#39;t want to be served pork he immediately acknowledged and started to warn us of the possible dishes that had alcohol and other bacon items so we could avoid it!

Phenomenal service bundled with outstanding meat quality just made this experience worth having and remembering! 

One of my favorite fine dinning restaurants and by far the leader in my search for the best in the United States!

Yes this place is priced a bit on the higher side but it&#39;s an all you can eat style restaurant, but by god your taste buds are going to be jumping from the very first bite to the last bite you swallow!!!

100% a must go !!! Undeniably the best! 

Done proudly!!!

The service has been awesome minus a waiter or 2 who had dollar signs in their eyes (Slavko) and one who couldn&#39;t smile because his heart was made of ice (i don&#39;t know his name but I call him Smiley).  Other than those sour pusses - I like that the wait staff is friendly and outgoing.  Best waiter - bald guy - I think his name was Anton - told me he once ate 30 lamb chops.  I loved it.  That&#39;s the type of jovial disposition I want.  When I go there and am spending $50 a plate, it is clearly a special occasion.  I want someone to be as happy as I am.  I don&#39;t need a lot of attention but don&#39;t be all serious and make me and my table feel awkward,  The gauchos are AWESOME! I LOVE THOSE GUYS!  They are so friendly and if they know you like a certain type of meat - they&#39;ll bring it to you as soon as it comes out!  They smile and laugh - it&#39;s great! I can get meat anywhere but the awesome experience I get when I get happy gauchos and a happy waiter makes this place worth every penny."

Since then, I&#39;ve really enjoyed this type of dining for the variety, fun, and indulgence. I look for places like this wherever and whenever I travel. I was in Chicago visiting my kids, and wanted someplace special to take my daughter out for her birthday. Texas de Brazil got the nod.

Best customer service ever! Our party of four was assigned two servers who catered to our every need. Each time we left for the table, we would come back to clean plates and napkins that had been nicely folded. I asked where the men&#39;s room was, and was even escorted all the way there by one of the servers! 

The food was spectacular, and prepared perfectly. I like my cow to moo and my lamb to baa. I was not disappointed, but there was plenty of medium and well-done for other palates. The salad bar included smoked salmon that equaled or bettered many that I&#39;ve had in Alaska! The fejoada was as good as I remembered when I first tried it in Rio de Janeiro. A complimentary dessert came for the birthday girl, and a good time was had by all. 

Highly recommend!"

It&#39;s unfortunate that the downtown location is closed and it&#39;s a far drive for Texas in Woodfield mall. Overall, the salad bar and the side dishes available is more of my tasting. I enjoy the smoked salmon, seared tuna, lobster bisque, and the Brazilian fish. The banana and the cheesecake would be my favorite and it&#39;s usually cooked right. I prefer the selection of meat in Texas vs other places. Few of my favorite: beef rib tip, flank steak, and the house special sirloin. 

The dessert is a display of wax model and you would chose. Overall, it&#39;s average large portion of dessert that is enjoyably edible. The papaya one is more of a cream dessert, which i thought was too heavy."

I made a reservation on OpenTable for Friday, March 18th and kindly noted that it was my birthday. The hostess was the only one to acknowledge it was my birthday and gave me a half-hearted happy birthday which sounded almost forced. 

When it came to the dining experience, the salad bar and meat choices were great. The meat itself, was a really toss-up if you would get a tender piece or one that seemed to be re-heated and very tough. Our ratio was only about 1 tender piece to 3 not-so tender pieces. When it came time for dessert, I was kind of shocked that there was NO complimentary birthday treat. You would think that at a up-scale restaurant a least a small gesture of appreciation would be given. 

When it was time for our check, I kindly presented a $25 off coupon as I signed up for their promotional campaign. The rest was to be paid by 2 $50 gift cards. I was going to leave a generous tip for my server, Adolfo, but he told me that I cannot use a gift card for the tip. WHAT? The server also mentioned that the decision came from the owners. Sorry but I work in finance in the hospitality industry and have never heard such a thing. Gift cards are to be considered as cash and there was no mention anywhere on the gift card that the amount cannot redeemed for gratuity. 

We ended up getting a dessert to go and now have a $15 Texas de Brazil gift card that I have absolutely no use for."

This Thanksgiving we decided to try it out after a bigger family party fell apart.  I have to say, I always liked it before but I was blown away this time.  My wife, who usually maxes out at about 6 or 8 oz of meat, left thoroughly impressed and surprised.  It was her first time here, and she couldn&#39;t stop talking about it the rest of the day.  It reminded us of our experiences with the churrascos in Rio, in Leblon and Copacabana and Leme which we loved very much (it&#39;s a bit different, but the concept and the meats are much the same).  I would call this a churrasco experience Americanized in a very tasteful, refined way.  But, I&#39;m no expert on Brazilian culture...

Any way the food was very good as usual, with an impressive salad/cold bar and carnivorous parade of meats.  My favorites are always the lamb, filet, flank steak (crusty outside cuts) and the garlic sirloin.  But what really sent it over the edge was the OUTSTANDING service.  Our table waiter Matt provided the BEST service I can recall receiving in any restaurant, anywhere (note, you have one server who brings you drinks and desserts and makes sure everything is to your liking - that was Matt - while a team of passadores or &#34;meat waiters&#34; walk around with skewers cutting off meat onto plates).  We felt like VIPs, like their most important guests.  Impressive, considering we were a party of 2 while the average party size was probably 10 that day)

The management got us in despite being pretty booked up, which we appreciated.  We got there 10 minutes early for a 2:30 rez and were promptly seated.  We were given a small table near the back, and I was leery about that, but it turned out perfect - we were out of the foot traffic pattern and enjoyed a fairly quiet spot.  The place was about 75% full whe we arrived, but a short time later all tables were taken.  Despite the crowds, we got all the meat we wanted and enough of it (Matt saw to that, asking us what cuts we liked and ushering the passadores our way).  Still, it was busy, so there was some waiting involved, but that worked out to our benefit.  We were NOT rushed (which we often are in restaurants, I believe because neither my wife not I are drinkers) and we enjoyed a slow paced, two hour holiday meal.

We were going to plan a Fogo de Chao lunch outing for work, but I think I&#39;m gonna insist we go to Texas de Brazil.  I think it&#39;s better.  Some will disagree but I think overall, it is.  The meats are very similar, TdB has a much better salad bar and overall better service (that&#39;s saying something, since Fogo&#39;s service is also exemplary)."

Even my kids - who whine about going to new places - absolutely loved it here and have requested several times to go back (unfortunately our checkbook doesn&#39;t allow for frequent trips here).

If you haven&#39;t had the opportunity to enjoy a meal here, put it on your bucket list.
The decor is elaborate and grand with high ceilings and tall doors even in the bathrooms. 
From the minute you walk in, the staff is friendly, accommodating and will do everything it takes to make sure that you&#39;re experience is everything it should be. We we&#39;re treated like guests, even family, by our remarkable server Miguel. He had my dad laughing and brought that &#34;like family&#34; feeling right to our table.
The appetizer buffet is a meal in itself. Lobster bisque was the soup of the day, and I could have swam in a vat of it. 
Just be cautious not to over do it on the soup and apps-for the onslaught of meat is about to occur. 
It comes in waves. The moment you turn that card to green, it begins. Your plate, once white, will be covered in small portions of incredibly well prepared and served meats. Filet, filet in bacon, chicken in bacon,  and Parmesan chicken, and pork... There were other steaks, varieties of seasoning, and served fresh off the sword. The servers were very good at providing the correct cut to match your preference and with a smile on their faces.
While these tidal waves of protein bliss are landing themselves in your belly, you&#39;re faced with two additional side dishes at your table. The mashed potato mound of happiness, and the two plantains covered in sugar and cinnamon, heated in a pan, that was laced with buttery goodness.
Right. Me. I did this all. It&#39;s all swimming around my insides constantly reminding me of each morsel that decadently passed my lips to get there.
I skipped dessert, but Miguel was kind enough to box, and even candle, dessert to go for my dad. 
Remarkable experience. Worth every cent, as well as the tremendous regret and self-loathing I&#39;m now left to cope with."

I&#39;m a photographer and wasn&#39;t even able to take one good image for our memories album for my moms 60th.  Worse part was some of our guest were late and they were extra rushed to get out.  
The waiter was so rushed to get us out!!! We asked ifbthere was anyway we could squeeze into somewhere else and they said no. We had ti leave bc they had another 14 people event to cater to and we had to go.  He said he asked the general manager if there was any way we could stay longer but the manager said no. we had to leave. The manager did not show his face to even speak to us.

Decor: I am not really sure how to describe the interior decorations but they are nice. The lighting might be a bit darker for some people, however we didn&#39;t have any trouble seeing all the delicious food we were eating.
Bathroom: Very nice and clean.

Staff: Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, checking on us several times throughout our meal. In addition to keeping our water glasses full he also offered to bring additional beers when we were near to finishing our currents. The meat-guys (I forget their official name) were wonderfully attentive at the beginning and mid-point of our meal. In fact, at one point I had to flip to red because I didn&#39;t have enough time to savor all the food on my plate. However, they seemed to slack off near the end, not visiting our table at all, which bothered me. In fact, I was &#34;full&#34; but not &#34;stuffed&#34; when I left - not the condition one should be in when leaving a Brazilian steak house.

Food/Drink: They have a good selection of beers and a huge wine list, in addition to some specialty cocktails that sounded fun. But the food is where it&#39;s at. Everything was absolutely delicious and full of flavor! It goes without saying that there was plenty of food to be had (barring my comments above...) and the salad bar had plenty of wonderful treats to choose from.

Value: While it seems a bit pricey at first, I think the cost is right where it should be, perhaps a bit cheap actually, for what you get. The meat and salad bar are all worth the price tag.

I&#39;m not sure what I did to get the meat-guys to miss me at the end, but I would certainly return and try a different tactic. This place is great!"

What can be said about this place that hasn&#39;t already been said? You pay $50 per person, less beverage, and you start at a buffet of salads, cheeses, soups, some very basic sushi and other delicacies. Back at your table, each diner has their own round Yes/No indicator. Green side alerts the servers you want meat, red side means you don&#39;t. They mostly serve different cuts of beef but they also have pork loin, lamb chops and leg of lamb, bacon wrapped chicken and sausage. You can eat as much as you want. They bring garlic mashed potatoes and fried plantains to the table as side dishes. They have a great dessert selection but I am always too full to eat any. Just one word of caution. The beef is typically prepared rare to medium rare, which is ok with me, but my wife likes her meat done more of a medium well. However, if you tell your server, they will do their best to prepare to your liking."

Hands down.  today was my first time eating there with my girlfriend. I made a reservation a week ahead. They took about 5 minutes to get us a table. The hostess was kind of rude. She didn&#39;t make the place welcoming at all. 

Our waitress gave us a 10 min monologue and couldn&#39;t understand her through her thick accent. Pretty much just had to figure out what to do on our own.  She wasn&#39;t personable and didn&#39;t make too much eye contact with us. She smiled more when we were close to paying our check. 

We came during an event week. $35 a person Monday-Friday, February 19th-March 1st. Don&#39;t waste your time bringing a coupon. I brought a $25 off certificate and they didn&#39;t give me the event deal. The waiter EMBARRASSED me and my girlfriend saying we had no clue what we are doing and that it&#39;s our responsibility to inform the servers if we have something like that. The guy stormed off after asking him the question and why they couldn&#39;t give me the event deal . He was a big freaking jerk. He brought the manager over to listen to my plea. The manager made weird facial expressions when asking him why they couldn&#39;t give me the event deal. He was a prick too. No courtesy for the customers. He&#39;s only in it for the money.

But since they were blown out to make room for that Disneyland disaster called Eataly, I&#39;ve been at a loss for my favorite endless meat spot.

Fogo de Chao sucks.  Brazzaz is only a decent substitute.

So my lady and I hit the burbs in order to reunite the animal kingdom with my mouth.

This Texas de Brazil is not as nice as the one we used to have in the city.  It&#39;s only on the ground level, so you don&#39;t have the spinning Wine Fairy on the trapeze.  When a server gave me a new plate, it had a smudge of... something... on it.  And my girlfriend ended up with a fly in her wine.  Also, the meat cowboys here don&#39;t come around as frequently as the old Chicago location.

However...

The Texas de Brazil concept is flawless.  Start with a killer salad bar with amazing au gratin potatoes, sauteed mushrooms and cheeses.  Then settle in and wait as the servers swing by every few minutes to offer you a new cooked animal, prepared in a new way.  

Parmesan crusted?  Sure.  Bacon-wrapped?  Yes.  Garlic-smothered?  Indeed.

I always try to avoid eating 24 beforehand.  I nod my head as row upon row of meat is presented before me.  I eat the entire freakin&#39; animal kingdom.  And then I don&#39;t need to eat for the next 24 hours.

Texas de Brazil is seriously one of the best dining experiences you will ever have.  This suburban location clearly has some kinks that need to be worked out.  But until the new Chicago location opens, it&#39;s nice to know I have a backup option."

Then come to find out two people from our group noted to the hostess it was a surprise dinner and they had to be seated soon before we arrived. I was so angry at this point I asked to speak to the manager who basically didn&#39;t give a crap and proceeded to print off the reservation ticket to show me it didn&#39;t say surprise party.

To be quite honest-- whether it be due to the lack of pallet refinement or it&#39;s just the reality of it-- I taste no difference between Brazzaz, Fogo and TB. 

BUT (yes, that&#39;s a big but), the service here is waaaaaaay better than Fogo in downtown. I mean when we went it was packed, yet, the server/s and the manager himself gave us/ me enough attention to continually pull/ push our seats in as we entertained ourselves with their superb salad bar. The taste of the meats were on-point, the Riesling wine was delish, my sister&#39;s custom virgin drink was even better (the one time where I wished to have had a non-alcoholic beverage over a classy buzz). 

All in all, I&#39;m a simple gal who&#39;s easy to satisfy-- the highlight of the night for me was their to-die-for lobster bisque, endless bacon, mushroom, and salmon. *drool

We had a certificate for $25&#39;s worth of food but needed the bill to be at least $35, I think. That wasn&#39;t hard to do since this place isn&#39;t cheap, but it&#39;s not outrageously priced like most hotel restaurants. Appetizers were under $10, most entrees were about $11-20 and all desserts were an even $6. I ordered a glass of wine for $8, so we had no trouble reaching the minimum requirement.

We split a Grilled Chicken Quesadilla and it was really good. There was a lot of chicken and cheese in each bite.

I ordered the Shrimp and Lump Crab Lasagna for myself and found that &#34;folded&#34; means it&#39;s almost like a cross between lasagna and a crepe. The seafood seemed fresh and the sauces that came with it were very flavorful. I liked that it was abundant but not too heavy. I&#39;d definitely order this again!

My husband went with the Strauss Farm&#39;s Grass Fed Burger. It wasn&#39;t the best burger we&#39;d ever had, but it was solid. It wasn&#39;t very fancy but it was very flavorful. He especially loved the cheese they put on it. He said he&#39;d happily order it again, though I felt $3 for the added fried egg was a bit much; however, they pride themselves on being locally sourced, so you can&#39;t exactly fault them there. It was only a $2 upcharge for the Parmesian Fries and I think that was worth it.

We split a Key Lime Tart and it was tasty. It&#39;s a good size, so you can either eat it alone or easily share it, I think.

Service was good. Our server seemed a bit unsure of himself, but he was very nice, brought us everything we requested, and he checked up on us and cleaner the table quickly.

The ambiance is pretty nice. I like the way they decorate, but they keep it rather dark. There was only one other person dining there when we went around 6:30pm on a Sunday."

I had breakfast and lunch/dinner coupons so I had pretty much everything on the menu. lol I&#39;ll give my review based on each meal. 

Flank Steak Salad-This salad was pretty good!.....until a few hours later when I was married to the bathroom. I asked for my steak med-well, but it was more medium which I don&#39;t understand since it was a flank steak, surely that easier to cook than a thick ribeye. Anyway, Ive eaten bleu cheese maybe 3 times in my life so I don&#39;t know if it was that or the steak that made me sick, but I was up all night &#34;getting it out of my system&#34; sorry about the detail, but its important when you&#39;re speaking about restaurant food. 

Chicken quesadilla-Now I know its probably not wise to continue to eat at a restaurant after getting food poisoned, but I was not going to pass up free meals and spend my per diem. I just decided to make better choices when ordering. The chicken quesadilla was really good. It came with a roasted tomato sauce, guac, sour cream, and pico. Very tasty!

Roasted Organic Rosemary chicken-this dish sounds really good on the menu, but it wasn&#39;t good at all. The chicken was bland and the sauce was watery and oily? I couldn&#39;t even finish it. 

Spicy chicken wings-Great! Sauce had a nice kick, not too much, just right. OF COURSE I I subbed the bleu cheese dressing for ranch (due to the episode I had the first night with the bleu cheese crumbles on my steak salad.)

Onion soup- Awesome! Probably the best onion soup I&#39;ve ever had. Lots of cheese and the bread soaked underneath in the delicious broth. I definitely recommend this. 

Apple pie-Blah. Tasted freezer burnt and looked more like bread pudding. PASS Additionally, I only had dessert on this day and it was the only day that I had terrible service. When I got back to my room I called the restaurant manager who promptly made up for the rudeness of the server by bringing up a bowl of haggen daz ice cream. 

Flatbread-I really loved the thin crispy flatbread pizza. I had the basil pesto and mozzarella and added chicken. Very good!

Crab cakes- Crabcake was good, a little different with citrus and apples on top, but its only one for $13. Not worth it. 

The coffee at the restaurant was too much for me. Not sure if it was too strong or just nasty. I just grabbed a cup from the Starbucks in the lobby. 

They also have soup and pasta of the day. I tried the pasta, it was ok, the sauce was just kind of bland."

The gnocchi was salty and made my mother and wife sick. The Ciopino special had a long dark hair that utterly ruined my wife&#39;s appetite. My daughter&#39;s crab cake was OK, but cold. 

My flank steak salad was OK. 

My son&#39;s steak a bit stringy. I honestly would never have expected that.

I checked out the menu online and saw that it looked pretty damn tasty. I figured that with a $25 gift certificate, it would be worth a try. I wondered to myself, &#34;How have I lived out in the &#39;burbs for so long and not known about this place??&#34; I would soon discover why. Fresh 1800 is tucked into the Schaumburg Hyatt hotel. I will admit, I was a little apprehensive on how our experience might be given the location.

My bf and I made reservations ((which aren&#39;t needed)) for a Friday night. We walked in to find about 3 tables filled with diners. Oh super...this didn&#39;t feel promising. There&#39;s something about eating in a filled restaurant that makes the experience more enjoyable, you know? At first glance, the decor is trendy and chic. Something that is def needed out in Schaumpton. It was a nice change of scenery from the Olive Garden or Houlihan&#39;s across the way. But it ended there. 

The food itself was actually quite good. I was fairly taken back. Fresh 1800 is just that - Fresh. They use local ingredients which is always pleasing. All of the dishes we had were delicious and presented beautifully. But as most places that use locally farmed ingredients, the prices are high and the portions are somewhat smaller. This doesn&#39;t come as a surprise to me, but something to consider if you&#39;re looking to eat a massive meal, at a decent price.

The two of shared a few dishes.
//Heirloom Tomatoes - Fresh Mozzarella, Arugula, Prosciutto and fresh Basil
//Seared Tuna Wrap - Cucumber, Jicama and Spicy Chinese Mustard
//Gunthorpe Farms Pork Chop with Fingerling Potatoes and Mustard Sauce
//Tenderloin of Beef with Potato Rosti, Spring Vegetables and Shitake Mushrooms

The service was slightly disappointing. Given we were one of a few tables, I expected the food to come out a little faster, and the server to be more attentive. However, the manager did stop by and everyone we encountered was very friendly.

Overall, I give them 4 stars on food. 3 stars on service. And 2 stars on location//ambiance. I wouldn&#39;t say I wouldn&#39;t go back. But, the prices are high and the atmosphere lacks quite a bit. I felt like I was actually eating in a hotel. 

It&#39;s definitely worth going for the food itself, but grab yourself a restaurant.com coupon ((when they&#39;re available)) to lighten the cost of your meal."

We stayed in the hotel for one night for a conference and didn&#39;t want to go eat at Olive Garden or one of the many other nearby corporate restaurants, so we came here. There were only maybe 3 tables on a Saturday night, which maybe should have been the first warning sign, no host(ess) to be seen and only one waiter. The menu sounds like it has foodie appeal when you read it and they claim to source ingredients locally, but the actual delivery was pretty awful. 

Of the plates we ordered for the table (1 small plate, 2 large plates, 1 sandwich), three of the four came out missing ingredients listed on the menu or with blatant substitutions that we weren&#39;t alerted to by our server. My lamb chops were well past medium although I ordered them medium-rare, yet the risotto they were resting on was terribly undercooked. My girlfriend&#39;s sandwich was the best plate of the night and also the cheapest. So I wouldn&#39;t recommend venturing beyond the sammies. 

The manager made up for some of the mistakes, but it still was a very disappointing meal. Apparently Olive Garden would have been the better choice after all."

My experience is that restaurants in hotels are generally overpriced and this is no exception. The decor was ok and appears that they have a buffet for breakfast and lunch because they have a huge steam table lining one of the walls. The waiter was knowledgeable and was not overbearing considering we were one of the only customers in the place. 

The menu was very limited but had a few interesting selections. I started with the broccoli soup and I have to say that it was the most tasteless soup that I have ever eaten. Adding a ton of pepper and some salt made it barely palatable. My entree was the braised short ribs which I have to say was pretty good. My wife had the lamb chops which she said were OK."

On the positive side, the atmosphere is very cool -- swank &amp; modern.  That&#39;s where everything positive ends.  We ordered the flatbread with mushrooms as an appetizer.  It took about 25 minutes to come out and it wasn&#39;t flatbread, it was more like a pizza.  It tasted ok, but I would not order it again.

Based on other Yelp reviews I read I decided to order the Cobb salad (everyone said it tasted SO fresh!).  I also got the grilled chicken panini with roasted red potato salad (I went with my mom and we were going to split both dishes).  First,  we had to flag the waiter over to place our order after waiting about 25 minutes.  This may not have irritated me if the place was busy, but there were about 3 other tables there.  The Cobb salad was nothing special.  It&#39;s lettuce, bacon, avocado, tomato and cheese.  The salad was good, but there was nothing special about it.  I could easily make the same thing at home or get something similar anyplace else.  I&#39;m not sure why other reviewers commented on how fresh it was ... if I bought these ingredients at the grocery store, it would taste the same.  The chicken panini was AWFUL!  The chicken was burnt &amp; charred on the outside.  When I bit into it, all I could taste was burnt chicken.  We both took about 2 bites and then decided it wasn&#39;t worth eating.  I can&#39;t believe they actually served us burnt chicken!   The panini didn&#39;t come out with the potato salad (which we were excited to try), it came out with fries instead.  We pointed out to the waiter it was supposed to come with potato salad and he said he would bring it right out!  The potato salad tasted like cooked red potatoes covered with mayonnaise.  It was so gross!   

To give you an idea of how slow the service is -- we only ordered the flatbread appetizer, salad &amp; chicken sandwich and we were there for 1 hour and 35 minutes.  It took FOREVER to place orders and for the food to come out.  I will not be going back."

My first clue should have been that they were offering discounts on Restaurant.com.  Located in the Hyatt in Schaumburg, IL this restaurant is exactly what you would expect in a hotel... an overpriced afterthought.  Went there on a Saturday at 7:30 pm.  Waited several minutes at the hostess stand to be acknowledged although we saw only 3 other tables seated in the dining area. When the host did arrive he asked us to wait a moment while he explained to a server what pine nuts were. Despite the fact that we were only the 4th table in the dining room when we ordered appetizers the server said they would take 20 -30 minutes because &#34;the kitchen was backed up&#34; !  Indeed it did take that long and one app was the &#34;soup of the day&#34; chicken noodle that was clearly from a can and could have been &#34;nuked&#34; and delivered immediately.  The other 2 were mussels and crab cakes.. The crab cakes were good, the mussels were dry and seemed like they had been microwaved then placed in a bath of garlic broth.  Entrees were Filet and  Rib Eye (both with scallops). Meat &amp; scallops were  cooked perfectly to temp but the &#34;share&#34; size extra of mac &amp; cheese might as well have come out of a Kraft box.. The service was almost overbearing. Our server checked back with us literally every 5 minutes.  We had to stop our conversation many times  because she kept interrupting us.  Typically I praise attentive service but this was too much.  It was almost as if she had nothing else to do..at one point she pulled back a vacant chair at our table and sat down to talk about desserts!.  I would never go back to Fresh 1800.

We originally came here to try the ramen burger. You can pass on this... Not crazy about their burger and i think the combo of ramen and burger made it taste salty. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the big deal with ramen burgers?!? I guess I just have never had a good one. Yet. 

Skip the dessert, they only had ice cream and chocolate stuffed beignets. Not worth the $5 for it&#39;s taste.

My hope was revived, though, when Tokio Pub came to the rescue by offering the ramen burger on an imaginary pedestal.

Here&#39;s a tip, though: eat the burger fast because otherwise the compressed ramen &#34;buns&#34; might start to fall apart just a bit.  Don&#39;t expect anything on this burger - it&#39;s literally a patty with some arugula sandwiched between to ramen &#34;buns&#34;...my fiancé had said he&#39;d have liked more condiments on the burger, but I personally loved the simplicity of the burger!

I&#39;m praising the burger, but all the other food was just as tasty!  Here&#39;s what we got and I&#39;ll list it in descending order what from I liked most to what I liked least: the Rangoon roll, the gyoza potstickers, vegetable fried rice and the fried chicken steamed buns.  We were able to get the potstickers for free with our Yelp check-in, and wegot the Rangoon roll and fried chicken buns for half-price because of Happy Hour!  There are select food and beers that priced for Happy Hour between 4-6 pm - look for the items listed in red on the menu because those are the Happy Hour specials.  Surprisingly enough, there&#39;s a fairly large selection of beers available for Happy Hour prices - this includes some Three Floyds beers for all you cult - followers like myself.

Back to the food, right?  The Rangoon roll is delicious, and what I liked best about it is that the tempura was not thick and flaky like so many other tempura-fried rolls, but rather it was very light and crispy.  The gyoza potstickers were also delicious - they were so good, but that also meant they were gone in a matter of minutes!  I would have been totally content with having three or more orders of these potstickers.  On to the rice - it was sweet with the perfect amount of saltiness which was complemented perfectly by the fried egg on top of it.  Lastly, the fried chicken buns had some spicy attitude to them - you get a lot for you money if you order these too!  All of this food and drinks (which were $3.50 each during Happy Hour) costed just over $50!!!  What a fantastic deal for such good food!  

If I were giving Tokio Pub a review based solely on the food it would be a five-star review, but there were a few off-putting factors about the restaurant.  One was the service which wasn&#39;t on par with many of the other Lettuce Entertain You restaurants I have frequented.  We got the potstickers almost right away, but then there was a huge lapse in time between that and receiving the rest of our food.  Our waiter also continued to hover around our table which was somewhat awkward when I was trying to fumble my way towards picking up the sushi with my chopsticks.  Secondly, I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of the atmosphere - the space was overly condensed and it was too modern...sorry, but I just don&#39;t like ultra modern restaurants.  Lastly, the bathroom is a journey in itself:  it&#39;s located in Shaw&#39;s - the restaurant located next door - and that makes for quite the inconvenience!

If you&#39;re going to Tokio Pub, it&#39;s the best bet to go during Happy Hour (Monday-Friday) because then you can get so much more for your money!"
tokio-pub-schaumburg,Richard W.,h1_SaFnrQgezK_s2cvqEpQ,"Joliet, IL",0,1,0,0,9,pBGNJc7B73REo5keNbrOwQ,2.0,2016-07-21,"THINK TGI FRIDAY&#39;S MEETS PANDA EXPRESS - PART 2

Continuing with the drubbing, TP&#39;s &#34;special&#34; maki are not so special...unless we are circling back to that inappropriate meaning of the word &#34;special&#34; that I avoided when I opened &#34;Part 1&#34;. I don&#39;t think that any of their offerings are even, technically, &#34;maki&#34; (&#34;wrapped in seaweed&#34;). Though, is it really surprising (or even important) that &#34;maki&#34; would be misused by TP? 

Think grocery store quality in terms of ingredients and preparation. Now I have certainly eaten my share of grocery store sushi since I acquired my Pavlovian response to the word almost 30 years ago. I have gotten that craving late at night in the 24-hour &#34;superstore&#34; and succumbed to it having forgotten how disappointed I am every time I break down and buy it. If &#34;grocery store&#34; quality is what you want, Mitsuwa Market is about five minutes away. You would be better served going there since theirs is far superior to that from any grocery store and certainly to TP&#39;s. In fact, it is probably better than 90% of the &#34;sushi&#34; restaurants serving in our area! 

We tried two rolls (err...sorry...&#34;maki&#34;) at TP. One was the &#34;sweet potato tempura role&#34;. It was OK. Their &#34;black rice&#34; was sort of blackish. So I guess that makes it cool and trendy. Right? I mean, don&#39;t you need to offer black rice these day to meet the &#34;new standards of roll coolness&#34;? Snarkiness aside, the flavor and preparation was not bad for this one. This is one of the few things that I would actually eat again at TP. 

Conversely, the &#34;lemon lime rainbow roll&#34; was a complete disappointment. Get the sauce on the side because the &#34;lemon lime&#34; in the name actually IS those two flavors. I get that this objection is certainly a personal preference. I object to citrus of any form assaulting the flavor of good raw fish. I&#39;ve discussed before the chemistry of &#34;why we put lemon on fish&#34; elsewhere so I will spare you that diatribe again. I also know that &#34;no citrus&#34; is not necessarily in full agreement with Japanese philosophy. Most importantly, I did say &#39;GOOD raw fish&#39;...so maybe it is appropriate? I had hoped that it was simply a clever play on words alluding to the &#34;colors&#34; of two ingredients: lemon being the hamachi (&#34;yellowtail&#34;) and lime the avocado (&#34;green, pasty goodness&#34;). NOPE! It was describing the &#34;secret sauce.&#34; So secret that the description of the roll does NOT explicitly list a sauce! Since it dominates the flavor, you would think that they might have mentioned that? Also, be prepared for the fact that you will NOT get each ingredient in every piece (or should I say in &#34;more than one piece&#34;?)...I guess avocados ARE sort of expensive right now!  Herein the snark means, &#34;cost cutting preparation&#34;.

Buns! Buns HAVE to be good and &#34;authentic&#34; right? Sadly, they are also not so much so at TP. The pork belly preparation is fine. However, doesn&#39;t everybody now &#34;sear&#34; pork belly and call it trendy? And don&#39;t forget, I did mention in &#34;Part 1&#34; that they drown the poor pig product in their overly sweetened &#34;Hoison&#34;. So they said it was &#34;pork belly&#34; but who could really tell what it was?  The &#34;fried chicken&#34; was worse, recalling the formerly cited &#39;reject of BW3&#39;s&#34; style boneless wing...this one with &#34;Buffalo sauce&#34;! As for everything, they are not truly &#34;bad&#34;, just average...uninspired.

Last, the signature item, the &#34;Ramen Burger&#34;, while somewhat of a novelty (sorry, TP, not really), was also pretty average. The flavor of the beef was decent and the portion was huge (it is a very thick burger). But, again, &#34;gentle&#34; preparation seems not to be TP&#39;s forte. We were admonished that less than medium rare preparation of the beef would be bad for the &#34;integrity&#34; of the &#34;bun&#34;. Despite our preference to actually taste the beef in beef, we followed that advice and ended up with something that was more akin to medium well...bun still fell apart. It is a decent burger...just not a great burger.

On another note, our primary wait staffer was nice but not particularly attentive. He was very pretty, smiled a lot, was highly conversational, offered his opinions about his favorites, but he did not come back very often. I get that they are &#34;busy&#34; for some, inexplicable reason, but it took us about 15 minutes to even get our final bill (and get it right). So, even that was a bit superficial.

We gave Tokio Pub a try because we wanted to shop at Mitsuwa and we had $60 in birthday awards built up from Lettuce Entertain You. It is not always convenient to make the trek downtown, especially on a weeknight. Metra does NOT fly, despite what some of their billboards imply. My recommendation to you would be that if you want casual Japanese &#34;comfort food&#34; done right in a cool environment then head downtown to another LEY Group restaurant, Ramen-san on Hubbard. There you will find what I think TP aspires to be...or maybe not...maybe they are EXACTLY what they aim to be, TGIF&#39;s mildly Asian cousin (like maybe the maternal great grandmother was half Chinese?!)"

Ordered 5 tacos ( 1 nacho 2 steak &amp; 2 shrimp ), the pork belly steam bun, &amp; the Rangoon Roll.  I was excited to have the shrimp tacos which are my favorite. We liked the sushi roll and the steam bun was ok. The sauce was too sweet n there was something else that just didn&#39;t taste right. On to the shrimp taco, I took a big bite and as I started chew something tasted funny in my mouth n didn&#39;t feel right. Something was poking me on the inside of my cheek, as I stop chewing I put my fingers in my mouth n pulled out a long wire twist tie. The other half was still in my taco. I spit everything out n pushed the food away. I lost my appetite after that! We showed our server n she brought it over to a manger. The server said sorry n the manager came over to make sure I was ok. I said I was ok and she took off the tacos. We pretty much paid our tab &amp; left. my BF said they should of done more than take off the tacos!?!? Looking back I felt like they should of. But us a round, give me a gift card, comp the whole bill, I dunno. Well, for sure we won&#39;t b back there!"

I&#39;m not even a picky eater but everything I ate, there was something wrong with it. This place is supposedly Asian themed and that&#39;s exactly what it gave off, themed. Because everything I ate felt like fake Asian food. The sauce for the meat, even the sushi rolls were pretty sad to be called a sushi. One of the rolls literally had just a huge cucumber in it with fish on top... Not my idea of a sushi roll now. Even the calamari &amp; Gyoza should have been cooked longer, not even crispy. 

The concept of cooking on rocks was pretty cool. But if it wasn&#39;t happy hour, I don&#39;t think I would have ever pay for the regular price. The sangria was surprisingly very good and we thought those were part of the happy hours deal but it wasn&#39;t. Maybe because I&#39;m Asian and have high quality taste for Asian food but this is not Asian at all. It&#39;s too Americanized..."

I don&#39;t think I would have come here otherwise. It&#39;s a very contemporary and modern style restaurant with great service. Our server was super friendly and our waters were refilled often. Signs that this was not an authentic Asian restaurant but a really nice place to have dinner. I did like the small plates on the menu which allowed us to try many different things.

Hot rock appetizer - it was a cool concept where they brought out a hot rock and let you cook slices of filet on it. The marinade on the filet slices was really tasty and the quality of the meat was great. I almost wanted to eat it raw so it was nice that the rock allows you to cook the meat to your preferred temperature.

Crispy rice shrimp and tuna - this was really tasty. The shrimp was really flavorful as well as the tuna but I enjoyed the shrimp a lot more.  And who doesn&#39;t like crispy rice?

Tacos - steak was delicious, fish was dry, and the shrimp was overpowered by the sriracha sauce.

Crazy Dragon Roll - perfectly assembled but it definitely needed more of a kick to it. The barbecue eel added great flavor to it but it still lacked spice. If they added some spice it would have made it perfect otherwise.

Beignets - the name is deceiving. They were more like donuts filled with chocolate. No matter what you call them though, they were delicious.

Overall, it was a good meal of Americanized Asian food but it was definitely pricey for the amount of food that you get. Also, nothing was really amazing that stood out to make me want to go back."

The parking was easy on a Thursday afternoon after the lunch crowd.  Parked  the car easily and walked over to the outside, covered patio.  Wasn&#39;t sure where to go in.  There  was a few tables occupied but no one said anything to direct us where we should go.  Finally, the waitress comes out.  She says we can come in through there and we get seated.  She comes back shortly with the menus.  She explains some of the specials going on, I wasn&#39;t listening well because I was looking over this  interesting menu. 

Godzilla Roll $11.00
When this was brought out  I couldn&#39;t help thinking what  the heck is this pretentious looking sushi they are putting down on the table? That is the weirdest sushi I have ever seen.  Not to mention the Feng Shui was not present.    I gotta take a picture of this for prosperity sakes. Now, to eat this thing, you gotta take the chip off unless you got a super big mouth.  Yeah, I didn&#39;t think so.  I dip a little bit into the shoyu sauce and place the whole thing into my mouth.  Not bad, atleast the fish was fresh from being frozen.  The chip by itself was okay.  With the sushi, it wasn&#39;t bad but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the kind of texture you&#39;d want with sushi.

Eggplant Roll ??
This was interesting.  Tasty.  Not over cooked yet tender.  A little garlicky.  A little kick I don&#39;t where from but not bad.  Not bad at all.  Yummy.

All this went down well with my cheap Tecate beer.  Would have preferred Pacifico but  wasn&#39;t available.  Any who... customer service could have been a little better.  Would have worked out if she stayed within the vicinity instead of disappearing.  We didn&#39;t mind too much since we had plenty time to kill before the movie.  Just another lazy day for us on a weekday while everyone else is working.  Ahhhh life."

Too bad we didn&#39;t make it in time for that but we did make it for the half price all red letter items which end at 5pm on Sunday. 

The place is small but it held a cozy feeling to it. The setting isn&#39;t meant for hosting alot of people maybe about 4 would be a decent amount.

The food was enjoyable alot of variety to choose from, from ramen, tacos, sushi, even food that can cooked on top of rocks!! A nice experience to try atleast once. 

I know that my review seems pretty positive, why only giving them a 3 star well. It has to do more with service. They seems to be understaffed at the time I was there, waitress took a while to take our order so we had to ask another one, the forgot to give me one of my other food orders after everything came out, and  in the end the waitress said if we download the lettuce eat we would get a $25 gift card toward lettuce eat for next time. Sad to say I didn&#39;t receive that. 

So overall enjoyable food and setting, but service can be a better and really wish I wasn&#39;t lied to about that."

Shrimp tempura roll
Grilled steak ramen bowl
A three taco combo - crispy fish, crispy chicken, and barbecue pork
Ramen burger

This was the first time (and alas it will be the last time) that I tried a ramen burger ($11) and I learned that I much prefer a good conventional burger with a bread bun.  The fried ramen just didn&#39;t have the right texture and taste with a beef patty.  The large burger patty itself was just fine. The small tacos were ok at $1.50 each but would be pricey at the regular $3 price.  The ramen bowl was fine, but we proactively asked them upon ordering to dilute the salt level down for us, and they did well for us on that front.  Overall, an ok meal in a friendly comfortable setting, the kind of setting you expect in a LEYE franchise."

Shaw&#39;s little Asian inspired outpost has an eclectic menu with everything from sticky rice bowls to sushi to hot rock appetizers. Two girlfriends and I enjoyed a smattering of light bites to finish off a very busy Monday. Their cocktail menu is fairly limited but what I had (Tuantuan) was refreshing and delicious. As for food, here&#39;s what I sampled:

1) Volcano roll: 5/5: Very fresh with the right amount of heat. The tuna melded perfectly with the jalapeno and was finished off nicely with cilantro and a drizzle of chili oil. 

2) Ginger garlic edamame: 4/5: Exactly what you&#39;d expect and tasty at that. 

3) Filet hot rock appetizer: 4/5: The pieces of filet were fairly small, but they were tender and flavorful. I appreciated the array of salt and sauce options that came along with it! 

4) Calamari: 3.5/5: It&#39;s just the rings, here, which is nice for those who are anti-tentacle. The dipping sauce has a kick but works well with the crispy rings. 

5) Blondie: 3.5/5: For the one time in my life, I wasn&#39;t in the mood for a chocolatey dessert, so I went with the Blondie. The orange dotted blondie itself had a sizable dollop of fresh vanilla ice cream on top which made for a nice, refreshing end to the meal. The blondie itself was a tad on the dry side, but overall a big hunk of sugar that I was desperately seeking."

It is not quite what I expected, much softer than I would have thought and very messy.  I wish they had cooked it to the proper temp, I asked for mid rare and it was more mid well.  I would have sent it back if it had not taken them so long to come out. 

So we were asked when ordering if we wanted our apps first or with our meal. We said first.  Well somehow they interpreted that as bring out the apps when the rest of our table got their entrees.  Where in the world does saying we want them first mean that we get that instead of our entree then our entrees come later?  Not happy about that at all.   Then it took another 15 minutes to make our burgers. This was not a pleasant experience by any means.

The fish taco was pretty decent, though small.  You have to order them in sets of 3 or 5 so for 3 tacos you would pay 9 dollars and it&#39;s nowhere near worth the money. Any mexican place would have made a bigger and just as good or better fish taco.  It wasn&#39;t bad, just not worth the money.

The bang bang calamari was pretty good, I wish they could have figured out how to keep it crispy while still having the excellent chipotle mayo with honey sauce (that&#39;s the way i describe the flavors not them).  I did enjoy that thoroughly and would get that again, much better than other places where I&#39;ve had bang bang where it&#39;s overwhelmingly spicy or vinegar based.

We were the only people in the restaurant for a while, but service was kinda slow, it took a while to get our waiters attention and the only reason we got our bill is because we all stood up after waiting a while. I actually ended up taking the bill to the counter to pay even though there were only 2 other tables in the place when we left."

Started with the Skirt Steak Hot Rock. Overall it&#39;s ok, way too much basil marinade which killed the presentation and didn&#39;t really make you want to eat it. Like a small lake of watery green sauce on raw meat... How about spoon a little onto each slice of meat... Once cooked it was good enough but had to get a second rock for the last piece...

Had the Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna. Not bad for a gimmicky snack...

Finished with 3 tacos. Shrimp, Steak, &amp; Chicken. At $3 ea not that great a deal for the small size. Quality was ok. If you&#39;ve ever ben to Mercadito etc downtown you&#39;ll know what I mean. 

Others have said $1 taco hour or happy hour is the time to go and I&#39;d have to agree. TP is different in it&#39;s offerings but I can&#39;t say it hits home for me personally. Nothing was bad here just so so. I had a couple beers and my bill was $44 out the door. I might go back if someone else wanted to go but it&#39;s not a destination for me.

The menu seems more targeted these days, basically just offering various apps, sushi rolls, tacos, and ramen bowls. I thought I remember them in the past offering more entree style dishes. While it&#39;s a little limited, everything I&#39;ve tried on the menu so far has been pretty tasty. 

I usually go later at night or on weekends, but I decided to meet up a friend for an earlier dinner on a random Monday. Lucky for us it turns out there were some killer deals when we went. We got there just in time for their happy hour, which means it&#39;s half off select items on their menu. Then half an hour later they said it was taco time and all tacos would be $1 for an hour. On top of that we got a free gyoza appetizer just for checking in on Yelp. For drink specials they had $5 cocktails. Can&#39;t beat dem deals. 

Food: I was in the mood for some ramen (when am I not?), and for the first time I had the unique opportunity to order ramen two ways: one in soup form, and also in burger form. Yea that&#39;s right, they were offering a ramen burger. 

Spicy chicken ramen - I&#39;ll be honest. I came in with lower expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I knew this place didn&#39;t specialize in ramen so I wasn&#39;t expecting them to be simmering pork bones for multiple days to achieve extreme depth in their broth. The noodles were on the thinner side and were pretty standard. The chicken was actually breaded and fried, and it even kept its crispy outside even though it was floating in the broth. The broth was actually pretty delicious too. It wasn&#39;t that rich, but it definitely wasn&#39;t bland. The broth had a thin texture, yet was flavorful and slightly spicy from the chili oil, with a good amount of saltiness too, which I personally like. It was basically just a tasty bowl of soup, and I can&#39;t really complain about that.  

Ramen burger - This is basically a hamburger that uses a chunk of compressed, pan-fried ramen noodles as the bun. It&#39;s definitely a unique concept I haven&#39;t seen at too many other places. I thought the actual ramen element was more of a gimmick than anything though. It didn&#39;t really add any distinct flavor to the burger or really remind me of ramen in any way. The outside of the noodle buns had a nice sear to it but for the most part the middle was soft and kind of mushy. I didn&#39;t think the ramen part was bad, just nothing special from a taste standpoint. In my opinion the real star is the actual burger patty. The meat was super tender and juicy and it had a nice molasses glaze that gave it a sweet/savory Asian spin to it. It was a pretty tasty burger that makes you curious enough to try at least once. 

Overall Tokio Pub is a solid place that has a modern and trendy atmosphere and offers a decent Asian fusion menu that is even better when there&#39;s a bunch of specials available."

I went back with the husband and his cousins who came to town! We, of course, got the Spicy Braised Pork Nachos again - still just as epic and delicious as before! 

This time, I also got the AHI TUNA on the Hot Rock Appetizer menu - delicious big pieces of tuna that you sear yourself on a hot rock - very cool, fun, and interactive! The hot mustard and cucumber salad that comes with it is yummy! Cousin got the SKIRT STEAK on the Hot Rock and that was delicious!! 

Also got the SPICY TUNA ROLL which unlike the usual ones I&#39;ve tried, the roll comes out with the spicy sauce on the side and it&#39;s spicier with a kick, which I loved. Would have liked more of the sauce, though! 

DRINKS -- I had the BOURBON AND BUBBLES which was a sweet cocktail, super cute and girly. Then I also had a MAKERS OLD FASHIONED, which was sweet and delicious. I think all around the table the drinks were pretty good!

4 stars! :)"

Wasn&#39;t really sure where to go after we had walked in, and even after entering the restaurant it was a little confusing as there wasn&#39;t a host stand.  I ended up walking all the way through to Shaw&#39;s, realized I was no longer in Tokio Pub, and then walked all the way back and asked the guy behind the bar who was very friendly and seated me immediately.

We made use of the check-in offer (free gyoza!) and I ordered the ramen burger, have to try it once in my life, right?  The gyoza was okay.  The ramen burger was good, but I&#39;m not sure is get it again.  The burger itself and the toppings were great, the ramen part I wasn&#39;t really a fan of.  They are thinner than your typical ramen noodle and so do have the same &#34;al dente&#34; bite and they were a bit bland.  Like it could use a packet of ramen seasoning sprinkled on top, although that might be a bit excessive.

Overall the experience was good, food was okay.  I would check it out again."

My friend and I decided to go to Tokyo pub for brunch as we talk about visiting all the time but never do it. 
I liked the decor. It was trendy. Small joint connected to Shaws  but very cute. They have a closed patio which was heated but nobody was there. I want to go and visit it in the summer. 

My friend had a mixture of tacos and I had the ramen steak soup. She loved her tacos, they were bite size and fit for barbies but hey she was happy. I liked my steak soup but I didnt love it. I think i would have loved it had it not been so salty. It had so many fun ingridients and presented gorgeously. Thumbs up on that. 
The mimosas were fantastic too.

I was feeling a bit adventurous, and decided it was time for me to sample some more Asian cuisine (my education in eastern foods has been an ongoing project for Taylor M).  So, we settled on Tokio Pub.  I&#39;m happy to say, I really enjoyed the food here!  I&#39;m not a huge sushi buff, but the shrimp tempura I got was served with a sweet chili sauce that was amazing!  We tried an order of egg rolls that was pretty great as well, and finished off the meal with the hot rocks fillet.
     As I said, all the food here was delicious.  However, the service was lacking.  We placed a drink order quite a while before placing our food order, but were served our food without having received our drinks.  When I asked our waitress where our drinks were, she went to check on them and came back saying that there was a problem with the printer at the bar.  Even if that were the case, which I don&#39;t believe it was, that doesn&#39;t excuse her not checking on our table and noticing that our drinks were absent.  Even worse, there was no genuine attempt at an apology, just a lame excuse, and it still took another 3-4 minutes before our drinks arrived!  Maybe this was just our server, and maybe everyone else there is great, but I was very displeased with this service."

I searched through the Chicagoland area to find a place that serves up a decent ramen burger and stumbled across Tokio Pub.  The raving reviews won me over.  My sister and I stopped in for lunch one afternoon while we were in the area.  If you are having a little trouble locating Tokio Pub, fear not, it shares a building with Shaw&#39;s Crab House.  Just head towards that way and you will soon discover the small doorway that will lead you into a lounge like atmosphere.

As we entered the pub, we noticed the place was empty except for a couple of tables.  Even with the almost empty pub, the service seemed to be nonexistent.  No one was around to greet us and give us a table; we had to walk up to the bar so we could be seated.  After grabbing seats, it even took a while for our waiter to come by.  Finally when we were able to order, we decided share:

Goyzas - Japanese potstickers filled with chicken and pork served with a ginger sesame vinaigrette.  Free with a yelp check-in and a purchase of an entrée, so why not?  They were nothing special, just tasted like regular frozen goyzas bought from the grocery store.

Ramen: Slow-Braised Pork in Fukuoka Broth - fresh ramen, wakame, sesame seeds, pickled ginger, shitake mushrooms, and a soy-marinated egg.  This ramen wasn&#39;t my cup of tea, but my sister thought it was ok.  Ramen is supposed to be hearty and bursting with flavor, but to me the ginger overpowered the whole entrée.

Ramen Burger - angus beef patty, soy molasses, and green onions served with a side of cucumber salad.  I had high hopes for this burger, but it was nothing like what I read about.  The ramen is supposed to be fried hard enough to hold the shape, but still soft on the inside.  My ramen burger was soggy and following apart.  The molasses could be the culprit, but who knows.  The patty was overcooked, so it was a slight bit chewy.  This really was a huge disappointment.

Overall, I enjoyed the ambiance but that was it.  The food was mediocre and the service was horrible.  Also, the bathrooms were a huge inconvenience.  You have to walk through Shaw&#39;s Crab House and then up the stairs to access the bathrooms.  Be prepared to take a long trek.  If you were thinking of coming here, I would recommend you to opt out.  There are so much better places in the area to grab a bite to eat."

We made reservations for Friday night and were immediately seated when we arrived. We ordered the crispy rice, a maki roll, spare ribs, and the fish tacos. We also tried the sake and ginger mojitos. 

Overall, the interior looks nice, but the seating isn&#39;t practical. The tables are way too close to each other. We felt like we couldn&#39;t have a quiet, private conversation together. 

The food is ok. The crispy rice was good. I&#39;ve had better sushi than the maki roll I had. The tacos were good. But literally, two bites and it&#39;s gone. 

For the price, I would&#39;ve just gone to Shaw&#39;s and ordered a meal with drinks instead of the pay for a dew apps that were just ok.

I have been to this restaurant multiple times. Service is usually good, prices are a little high. Recently, i ordered the hot rock appetizer. It was a very small amount of meat, and to be honest the meat was terrible. Not only that, the &#34;hot rock&#34; didn&#39;t stay hot long enough for me to cook all of my pieces of meat. I was next to a cold window which could be why, but i was so disappointed that i paid $10 for maybe 3 bites of meat.
The pork nachos are by far the best thing on the menu. The tacos are good, just be aware that some of their items don&#39;t list everything - like the sauce on the chicken tacos. 
The deserts are really good and I recommend saving room!

First, we started off with the Tauntaun, which was $5 that night. Speaking of which, they have some great appetizer/drink deals throughout the week! The Tauntaun is basically a moscow mule. Very good! We then shared the Japanese hot rock appetizer. I thought it was neat and definitely something I have never seen before. However, I think it&#39;s a bit overpriced for what you get, so I probably wouldn&#39;t do it again. We then had one of each of the tacos, and one of the sushi rolls. I wasn&#39;t impressed with the sushi at all, but the tacos were good (the Tiger Shrimp was the best). They are small, hence the reason why they are so cheap. Since it was my birthday, we got a free order of the Beignets. So good!! 

The service was very good throughout the night. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us out through the night.

I would come back, especially during a happy hour."

We entered through the long walkway and into the side and we just waited by the bar area and were taken care of promptly. For a group of 4 on Saturday around 9pm, there were still a number of open tables.

Our sever mentioned that she was new, so she didn&#39;t know much about the various beers, but she did offer samples so that was nice. My friend explicitly said he was GF when ordering, but she brought out regular soy sauce for his sushi dish. Good thing he asked. She was apologetic and brought out the GF soy sauce. I would think most people with dietary restrictions generally are cautious anyway, but that&#39;s still worrisome for mishaps like that.

Anyways, I got the ramen burger, as I&#39;ve never had it and for being quite a fad for awhile, I don&#39;t really know many places even in the city to have this. 

All of our food came out at an appropriate time. The ramen burger was quite greasy but I didn&#39;t mind. I thought it was a bit bland but also thought that it was as good as it was going to be. I&#39;m glad I tried it and it wasn&#39;t bad by any means, but likely will not get it again. I tried boo&#39;s pork belly and the pork belly and pineapple skewers were quite yummy. The accompanied rice worked well with the dish.

My friend&#39;s hot rock lost heat pretty quickly so he had to ask for another one. I feel like it is their responsibility to check on the hot rocks though.

Overall, Tokio Pub is good for the area and one of the better options over there, but by no means is it amazing. Prices are fair though. I would like to try their ramen next time especially as it is $12 vs. average $16 bowls at places in the city, even mediocre ones."

Fried coconut bao was just okay. The chocolate filled beignets though were like crack!

UPDATE: Had to knock off one star...came home after dinner and an hour later, fingers in both hands were tingling.  Looked up and it&#39;s either because of too much sodium or MSG.  Had to drink at least 64 ozs of water to get it to stop. It eventually went away after 4-5 hours."

We ordered several rolls, beer and wine. The food was Great and the service wonderful. Under the circumstances they did very well and I forgot that I wanted oysters Rockefeller...lol

They have three kinds -try all three.   Chicken ramen came with a spicy broth that had depth and character.  It is definitely spicy for those who can&#39;t take spice (I personally liked it alot) guaranteed to sweat, but its a good heat.  Steak/beef served with a soy based broth was a little strange as the flavors don&#39;t quite fit with a ramen bowl -tasty on a taco though.   And of course winner winner is the pork, classic rich thick broth and well prepared pork. I downed the entire bowl of broth.  I could have the broth as my breakfast lunch and dinner.  

Noodles were somewhat clumpy on some of the bowls we tried though, so there is some improvement to be had.  

When I feel like a little ramen, it helps to have a little more variety for just a few bucks more for the Sunday special.  

Yelpers get something just for checking in.  

Service is good and friendly, informative and knowledgeable servers.  

Other items that I enjoy include tacos (a bit on the small end, but each is a burst of flavor!). Two bites each taco for my chomping.  

Each week Tokio has taco night hour $1 tacos, must order either in 3&#39;s or 5&#39;s.  Goes down great with a Sapporo."

The noodles were as dense as the other one and the meat had more flavor.  I probably wouldn&#39;t get it again though - noodles were not right, maybe even raw for the chicken one.  They put way too much noodles in it too, maybe because it&#39;s bottomless and they&#39;re trying to weigh down my stomach?  Blah.

We ordered an assortment of tacos to start. I had the shrimp and it was wonderfully seasoned. The perfect spice level. The pork belly ones I hear were great too. The chicken ones weren&#39;t anything to write home about and just tasted like a chicken tender on a taco I heard my Bf say. I went for some sushi as my entree. The best roll was the Acapulco roll and the rest (California, Godzilla, and Lemon Lime) were nothing special.

Few times in my life have I had a dinner experience where the actual experience is what I remember. My time at Tokio was one of those expertly crafted evenings.

Each month Tokio has special events. Last night was their 4 year anniversary party. 4 courses, 4 drinks, $45.

Each course, each drink, wowed my table and brought the dining experience to a whole new level. The play on normal foods was elegant and sophisticated while being fun and whimsy. A lot of courses menu&#39;s get bogged down by trying to show up the previous course, this wasn&#39;t that. Each dish offered something new to the meal.

We started with Thai Nachos and sparkling sake, followed by a dish called Tuna Butterfly in a Spring Field and a citrus cocktail, and then the main course was Bacon and Egg Ramen with a glass of Beaujolais, and to wrap up the evening we had a Birthday Cake Egg Roll with a cake batter booze shake!

In addition Tokio had $5 handcrafted cocktails so we tried a few of those. My favorite is The Local, which is few gin, koval rose hip, social sparkling sake, cream of coconut, basil, fresh lemon juice, and like nothing I&#39;ve ever had before.

Needless to say I will be back to Tokio, and my group already made reservations for their next event, their Beer Dinner on May 18th! Did I mention that for attending the event we each got a $40 gift certificate for next time?

Really Tokio can&#39;t be beat. Check it out and fall in love like I did!!!"

Make sure you check in for free gyoza! :)

Maybe it was the lunch menu, so it was a small menu? Maybe it&#39;s just always like that. I&#39;m not sure.

We ordered the Japanese hot rock filet mignon, gyoza, crying tiger shrimp tacos, crispy fish tacos, lemon lime rainbow roll, slow-braised pork in fukuoka broth (ramen), &amp; then beignets for dessert.

The Japanese hot rock filet mignon was as fun as it was tasty. It was nice to be able to cook it for as long as you like your steak cooked. Med rare for me, of course! It seemed like the rocks lost heat really quickly tho. The second time around, it was hot, but not sizzling hot. Also, they knew 3 people were eating and they only brought 2 rocks. Hmm... but they did bring me one right away after I asked. It also came with a dipping sauce trio thing with pickled ginger cucumber, salt, &amp; some dipping sauce.. not sure what was in it. The order comes with 5 pieces of filet &amp; the extra piece we ordered was $2. 

Gyoza was ok. It was free so I can&#39;t complain.

The tacos were small, but very good. We ordered one for each person, but I easily could&#39;ve eaten them all by myself. Literally 2-3 bites for one taco. They both had a spicy kick to them. The tiger shrimp was huge! The tacos were my favorite of the things we ordered.

The lemon lime rainbow roll was just your typical roll. It had tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and crab.

The slow-braised pork in fukuoka broth was a ramen. My problem with ramen is that it&#39;s usually really bland. I haven&#39;t really found one that I like yet. This was not much different. It had kimchi in it, so it kinda felt like I was eating at home. Watered down, overcooked ramen with kimchi that has been washed. If you&#39;re korean, you&#39;ll know what I mean. Other than that, I didn&#39;t like it that much. It was just ok, no flavor.

Last we got the beignets. They were filled with chocolate &amp; they were tiny! Nothing special.  

Mostly everything was really good (half was good, half was ok), just the portions were on the small side &amp; seemed pricey for the portion size. 

I&#39;d still come back tho. Maybe when they have $1 tacos since those were so good, but I&#39;ll bet it gets super busy those days, plus parking must be a nightmare."

I had chicken, steak and fish. Honestly, I felt like they all had very similar tastes. I also had the calamari, which I thought was a little too greasy. The soup was a chicken kimchee soup. That was definitely tasty and I recommend that."

It&#39;s hard to notice if you&#39;re not too familiar with the Streets of Woodfield and even then, you might miss it. It&#39;s attached to Shaw&#39;s and close to the Big Bowl (for your reference). 

The ambiance is cool, dark and swanky- the kind of atmosphere you expect from a LETTUCE restaurant. The menu is diverse and offers a cool fusion of Japanese and Mexican flavors, that are unexpected. Unfortunately, the food doesn&#39;t deliver. 

Been here a couple of times and each time I&#39;m left with a meh experience. The rolls are ok- fresh but small. The taco&#39;s which they&#39;re known for are pretty good, but too much tortilla to filling ratio. The presentation however is great. 

My taco rankings in order: 
1. Crying Tiger Shrimp- big butterflied shrimp, sweet and spicy (best bang for your buck)
2. Nacho Taco: Most creative, can be a little sweet
3. Crispy Fish: Fish is fried well but bland, slaw makes up for it
4. Steak Taco: Standard
5. Crispy Chicken: I don&#39;t like chicken... 

Drinks are good and strong, wish it had a larger bar just to enjoy the drinks. 

Overall it&#39;s overpriced for what you get and the cool factor will only get you so far."

The potstickers are yummy, the yakitori is a must. the tuna on hot stones is cool for the aesthetic but it&#39;s not something you need to get, it&#39;s more for the experience.

The beignets were crazy but good. I didn&#39;t expect all that chocolate in the first bite. I suggest you just eat it all at once if you don&#39;t want a chocolate mess.

The first two times the service was good and the food was excellent. I recommend the potstickers and the ramen burger. It&#39;s def a bit in the pricey side especially for the small portions they give you. So the first time I came here with 3 other friends. The service was extremely slow BUT they didn&#39;t charge us for drinks and gave us a free dessert. I realized shortly after that the reason they were being so overly nice was because they had a visit from cooperate. Fine, I&#39;ll take it regardless. 2nd time I came here was with 1 other person. Service was fast prompt and good vibes over all. 
Now, the third time. I came here with 8 people on an hour lunch. I already knew that service would be slow and given the time limit I did initially suggest otherwise. We ended up taking the chance and it was just god awful. When we got there it was over a 15 min wait just to sit us down. They sat us down WITHOUT menus and had us wait an additional 10 min. I even had to get up and ask for menus and the waitresses response was &#34;oh!&#34; -_- so by this point we were ready we asked to get our checks right away. We waited up until 10 min before we had to leave when the food was still not out or our drinks. We had to get up from the table once again to ask if we could get our things to go. But on top of this my friend and I were splitting one check. We told her this over 4 times and by the time she came back she screwed up everyone&#39;s tab and gave my friend and I a separate check. The waitress was not only rude giving us attitude and stank looks but also stupid AF. Moral of the story don&#39;t come here on a limited time and with more than 2 people including yourself."

If you&#39;re planning on visiting during a weekend (or really, even a weeknight) I highly recommend a reservation. This is a VERY small restaurant, and even on a Tuesday night my party had to sit at the bar. 

Aside from that, the servers are super friendly and very professional. When ours got too busy, another stepped in right away to take our orders and bring out our food. 

The spicy edamame is an awesome appetizer. They serve it with rice soaked with the chili sauce too, and if you like a kick, I definitely recommend it. I also ordered the shrimp crispy rice (which is only one piece) but for $3, it has better flavor than most entrees at other restaurants. 

My absolute favorite thing here is the sushi. You can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu, but I absolutely love the volcano roll. Everything is so well rolled and the fish is very fresh. 

The beer menu is great and every cocktail I&#39;ve tried has been good too. I really have nothing negative to say about this place! Check it out!"

The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was delicious.  My lady tried one of the ramen bowls, which was huge and looked beautiful upon its arrival.  She said it was delicious, and based on appearances, I wasn&#39;t surprised.  I ordered the pork belly yakitori and was similarly pleased.  The skewers of alternating pineapple and pork belly presented an amazing flavor combination, and the fried rice served with an egg on top made for a tasty companion.  Add in a nice selection of beers and complimentary &#34;beignets&#34; (really more like donut holes full of chocolate sauce) for dessert, and it was a wonderful experience all around.

Yep...usually all in one sitting.

As someone who has lived in California and Texas for the most part, this snow thing was fascinating....for a split second.... and then I got bored! We were looking for something close to our hotel with decent food and vibe. Tokio Pub was a pleasant surprise; it was quite full for a Tuesday night.  The ambiance is pub like of course, a little dim for my liking but comforting nevertheless. Because it was a little gloomy outside, I would have liked Tokio Pub to blast ACDC or likes just to perk things up..I live in San Francisco, I am used to flamboyance and loudness, I think Tokio could use some of that (in winters at least). Also, people who are talking about the rolls and sushi not being authentic here, you need to take a step back and think about what you are saying. The establishment has &#34;pub&#34; in its name, I don&#39;t think they are pretending to be an authentic sushi place. A quick look at the menu will tell you that this is strict pub fare that happens to be heavily Japanese influenced.
 
We were seated immediately upon arrival, our server, Alice (I think) was great. She took time to explain the concept to us and was very attentive. They had the restaurant week menu that day- for two people, $33 something for three shareables, one entrée and one dessert is not bad. But we skipped it, we are unpredictable that way. Wait, we are not, we ended up getting the most predictable shi*$ on the menu. 

The bang bang calamari was incredible. The calamari was fresh and cooked perfectly, the breading was light and the dressing was not overpowering at all. If you are a fan of bang bang or rock shrimp, give this a shot, it is good.

Volcano roll was also very good, I have never had a roll with soy paper before, the light green colored paper that almost looks like lettuce. It is not as chewy as nori, has a very subtle taste and is a great variation for rolls. Our Server informed us that you can ask for any roll to be made with soy paper.

The most disappointing preparation of the night was the king crab California roll. The rice was pretty dry and this dish did not do anything for us. This is what you get for ordering a California roll outside of California ;)

If you want to get some beers or sake or whatever, sit back and eat some food without thinking about the caloric intake, go check out Tokio Pub."

The nachos were different from what I&#39;m used to in the best kind of way, with a BBQ soy sauce and steak. Delicious! The potstickers were crispy and soft at the same time (perfect), paired with a spicy soy sauce. My favorite were the beignets, but two of the batches we received were actually cold. Thankfully they took the beignets off our final bill but otherwise can&#39;t wait to go back here again!  Easy to find parking, clean, great service and yummy food!

We came on a Friday night and they were busy but the service was quite good (4-stars for service).  On this visit the timing of our various courses came out at appropriate intervals and the service was attentive &amp; timely.  Even though there is a bottle of water on the table we never filled our water glasses ourselves and someone else was already doing it for us.  Some of he food, however, could have definitely been better (2-4 stars ranging for the food) so I&#39;ll split the difference and settle on 3-stars overall.

We started with the Sweet Potato Tempura Roll which was both our fave - a different &amp; vegetarian take on a sushi roll that was quite tasty.  For the entrees we ordered the Ramen Burger and 5-tacos (2 fish, 2 nacho &amp; 1 shrimp).  The Ramen Burger is a novelty and while the burger itself was cooked &amp; seasoned perfectly, with a delicious glaze on it, the ramen &#34;bun&#34; really had no flavor and I would have rather had a regular bun that would hold up better and allow for more toppings on the burger.  The tacos came on this platter with metal holders to keep each individual taco upright and I would have thought perhaps the metal would have been warmed to help keep the tacos warm longer but it was not and by the time just 1 taco of the 5 were consumed the other 4 were just luke warm...so the final 3 tacos were pretty much cold by the time they were eaten (and my husband is a quick eater so it&#39;s not like he was dilly-dallying eating them).  He said the nacho taco had the best flavor.  The fried fish taco seemed like a small frozen fish stick they fried and the fish had a bit of an off-flavor...as if frozen too long or fried in oil that needed to be changed.  He liked the shrimp taco but it only had 2 shrimp on it (these tacos are smaller but only 2 shrimp seemed a bit sparse even for the small size) and they had the tails on so you had to remove the tails and then put the shrimp back on the taco before you could eat it  - seemed a bit odd.  For dessert we tried the Coconut Bao which came with ice cream &amp; the Coconut Bread Pudding.  The Coconut Bao was quite small in comparison to the giant piece of bread pudding - granted the bread pudding is $1 more than the bao.  Both tasted quite good, though the bread pudding could have used some sort of sauce."

I made a reservation on Open Table for 6:30pm and we were seated right away after checking in with the hostess (who could have been a bit friendlier). I included my seafood/shellfish allergy in the comments/requests area on OT which was passed along to our waiter, Kevin. He politely introduced himself and was considerate in getting all the details about my allergy before asking what we wanted to drink. He let us take our time in ordering and was knowledgable about the menu when we asked for recommendations. He always made sure to check on us to see if we needed anything else and refilled our water without asking. 

We ordered 1 of the Japanese Hot Rock skirt steak with spicy thai basil appetizers that comes with 5 slices of skirt steak. You cook the meat yourself on a hot stone and watch it sizzle (which is cool because it is a smaller version of kbbq &#34;all you can eat&#34;). We each got our own hot stone. You also get house-made marinades, cucumber salad, and hot mustard sauce. We also ordered the chicken and pork Potstickers that comes with ginger sesame vinaigrette. This is your basic potstickers, which you can buy frozen and in bulk at Costco and cook at home yourself, so it&#39;s honestly not worth the money for 5 pieces. For our entrees, we got the filet mignon Yakitori with grilled crimini mushrooms in a spicy soy-garlic glaze. It also comes with a sunny side up egg on a delicious bed of fried rice. This is highly recommendable! 

My boyfriend also ordered the Tauntaun cocktail which is 42 below (vodka), pok pok thai basil, fresh lime juice, and goslings ginger beer. He said it was refreshing and he could barely taste the vodka. Kevin said it is one of the most popular cocktails. 


We also ordered food to go for my parents and we got 1 of each taco, the marinated chicken Yakitori, and the ramen burger. My boyfriend said he would go back for sure for the ramen burger - angus beef, soy &#34;molasses&#34; mizuna, green onion, all in between two ramen &#34;buns,&#34; and a side of cucumber salad.

I was drawn in by the Ramen Burger: a burger promising Japanese flavoring with uncooked ramen noodles substituting as the bun. It was an interesting concept, but it lacked flavor and was very greasy. 

There was nothing special about their sushi rolls, despite the effort to be creative with their tempura jalapenos.

The average ramen was brought down by adding chicken katzu - one of the marks of katzu is its crispiness, which, of course, is lost when soaked in ramen broth.

The saving grace was a good happy hour menu, with half price cocktails, discounted beer and a decent selection of discounted food."

Dessert has good prices too. Need to get the s&#39;mores when you go! Best dessert ever. Not sure we&#39;d come here for full price, maybe once in awhile. Want to try the robata sometime."

They have a unique and private feel despite sharing the same space as Shaw&#39;s. Their menu draws in flavors primarily from Asia but fused with Latin dishes and drinks. I recommend this place for any work outing. Also worth mentioning is their indie music selection playing in the background - always a good playlist.

The only downfall is that it lacks its own restroom. Patrons have to go through Shaw&#39;s to get to it."

Sorta trendy hip background music and fairly dark inside. This place is more of an appetizer joint rather than full complete entrees. We started with two of the different marinated steak slices that you drop onto a searing hot rock they bring you to quickly cook them and that was fun. Then tried two different sushi rolls which were very fresh and decent. The had one each of the little tacos. Those were real good. Especially the fish and ginger beef tacos. Then finished with the calamari which I really liked. We did a pitcher of the pub tea drink that was good but steep at $25. Pretty large bill for two people considering it was not exactly a lot of food portion. But still we liked the place and may try it again in the future.

The tacos are also good in their own right, but the ramen burger is my main squeeze.

This spot is connected to Shaw&#39;s in Streets of Woodfield, and it is a favorite lunch time and after work spot for me and the Voltron crew.  I work in EGV and don&#39;t mind the short mini trek to this awesome spot in Schaumbeezy."

The lunchtime atmosphere was relaxed and somewhat comfortable - definitely trendy.

We ordered a maki roll, a salad, chicken tacos and a very unique cook-the-meat-on-a-stone dish.

All the dishes were pleasantly delicious and nicely presented. Our server was also very sweet with minimal interruptions which was appreciated. 

Initially, I felt the prices were a bit high for the portions of eacg dish. After trying the food, I didn&#39;t mind the cost at all.

I look forward to my next experience at Tokio Pub in the near future!"

The pork nachos were to die for and a perfect find for a late lunch. Also, the beingeits! I recommend this restaurant to everyone I meet, but I haven&#39;t been able to get back since that first time. I went for valentines day this year to rekindle that love. Boy, was I disappointed. The pork nachos were a small serving, the tacos were tiny, and the beingeits had somehow gotten smaller. The service also left little to be desired. I&#39;m sad Tokio Pub has changed this much in just a short time. I&#39;m hoping it was just an off night due to the holiday, otherwise I won&#39;t be returning in the future."

I didn&#39;t care for the nacho taco, but I don&#39;t care for bbq sauce too much. The shrimp taco had nice flavored shrimp but the sauce tasted cheesy to me. The service was excellent.

Happy Hour (M-F from 5-6) at Tokio Pub is a great deal, but probably the only reason I&#39;d come here. Several appetizers are priced at 50% off, which is a good thing, because I would have felt kind of ripped off paying full price.

Normally I&#39;m never in Schaumburg on a weekday at this time, but I was in the area taking my niece for a driving lesson on Memorial Day, so I was able to take advantage. Let&#39;s face it: after taking a 16 year old out driving, I needed many drinks.

On Mondays, most of the cocktails are only $5, so coupled with specially-priced apps, it&#39;s a no-brainer. Drinks are Asian-inspired (many have sake) and are tasty and drinkable. I really liked the Tokio Rose. 

We ordered two sushi rolls: the shrimp tempura and the spicy tuna. Both were large and plenty to share, and considering the portion size, probably the best value on the 50% off menu. We also tried the ahi tuna and filet mignon &#34;hot rock.&#34; Comes marinated and raw, and then you cook it on the hot rock. Really tasty, but I would never pay $10 (full price) for such tiny portions. Tacos were excellent too, but at $3/each, you&#39;d be crazy to order them at any time other than Happy Hour or Taco Time.

The service was great, the food was good. I especially liked the chocolate beignets we brought home.

All in all, I enjoyed Tokio Pub, but I can&#39;t imagine coming here and paying full price without feeling cheated. Having said that, it&#39;s definitely worth coming here for Happy Hour. You&#39;ll eat some tasty viddles without breaking the bank."

Their happy hour is 5-6 each day and they have a TON of food that is half off during that hour including maki rolls. Their sweet potato tempura roll fulfills my need for orange poe-tah-toe rolls and has spinach tempura crumbs on the outside. I absolutely love that little touch. Every roll I&#39;ve tried at Tokio Pub is phenomenal and during happy hour they are just $4-5!!! It really doesn&#39;t get better than that in the pricing department.

I&#39;m always pushing everyone to Tokio Pub for their amazing happy hour - and on Tuesdays it gets even better! Half price bottles of wine all day. They have a sweet Snapdragon Riesling that I get every time for $14. Fantastic deal!

The best part about Tokio Pub is their outdoor patio. It&#39;s the perfect spot for a nice weather day happy hour. Plus, I&#39;ve had amazing service every single time I&#39;ve gone."

We loved everything we ordered.  Two of us shared five tacos, two sushi rolls, BBQ nachos, and potstickers.  Total?  $55, which also includes two cocktails.  We weren&#39;t charged for the tacos, but it&#39;s still an absolute STEAL.  I love that we were able to order a bunch of different things and share at such a low price.

The sweet potato roll, spicy tuna roll, and BBQ nachos were my favorites.

My friends offered me a glass from their pitcher of sangria, and I soon learned that I should never turn down sangria, because you&#39;ll get that cross-eyed, &#34;are you fcking crazy?&#34; look from your friends.  I actually just really wanted to browse the cocktail menu.  I had the Tokio Rose cocktail which had St. Germain and...who cares what else was in it, it has St. Germain!  I also had my eye on the Ginger Mojito.  Maybe next time.

The inside of this place is definitely on the trendy list.  Not too bright, not too loud, and busy but not too crowded.  I&#39;d come back here for a girl&#39;s night, date night, or if I just needed some damn food and a cocktail after a particularly stressful day.

When we arrived at 5:00 p.m., the place was nearly empty.  We left just before 7:00 p.m., and it was bustling!  I don&#39;t know if it was me just being a nervous nancy about getting out on time (needed to be at a Whole Foods event at 7!) or if it really did take a few extra minutes to get us our checks and swipe our credit cards.  Nevertheless, make sure that if you&#39;ve got somewhere to be when it&#39;s busy that you give yourself a few extra minutes to cash out.

They were also very accomodating with our semi-large group and had no qualms with splitting the checks, which is awesome!"

I honestly did not know I kept getting told to enter via Higgins Road, where that was not possible unless you went through the Streets of Woodfield, which you need to do to get to this place. I spent about 20 minutes trying to find this place as I was meeting some friends after work here. Needless to say, it is in the same building as Shaw&#39;s Crab Shack and I should&#39;ve looked this up prior to coming in Friday night traffic. I was surprised that this place wasn&#39;t more busy at 6 P.M. on a Friday night, but it definitely picked up the pace as the night went on. If you&#39;re coming later than 7 P.M. on Friday, I&#39;d recommend getting reservations. 

Like other reviews have already mentioned, it is a bit quirky of an entrance as it takes you to an indoor/outdoor place before proceeding to inside the restaurant to be seated. Make sure to enter by the Tokiopub sign otherwise, you&#39;ll be going to Joe&#39;s Crab Shack and have to walk all the way to the other side of the building.

My friends were already here about 25 minutes prior to me showing up, so they already ordered some great appetizers off their &#34;Happi Hour&#34; menu.

I had the Shrimp Tempura, which I was rather impressed with. I put too much wasabi on my tempura and it burned the whole way down. I thought it was great and well done.

I followed that by ordering a variety of Tacos. The tacos were great, but I probably should&#39;ve gotten something else as it was not as filling as I&#39;d hoped it would be. If you&#39;re hungry, get a ramen bowl. Those things are huge and will get the job of satisfying your hunger. Three people ordered the Ramen bowl and no one finished it. They ended up boxing it and taking it home.

This place had a hip/fun atmosphere and felt very trendy in a good way. I would also come back to this place again as well. The service we had was also very good and attentive."

I love the food, soups, shakes. I often will order a piece of soup bread (a piece of bread with 3 - 4 diagonal cuts to make it easier to rip apart, only $.99!)

There is a great secret menu - the Lucky 7 (a wreck with double meat, using the meat from an Italian) is my favorite. One of my favorite things about Potbelly is that you can customize your sandwich any way you want. Meatballs on your a Wreck (a wrecking ball), they can do it! I also love that their chicken and tuna salads are meat heavy, not tuna heavy. I also like that neither have onions (you can add onions if you want, but it&#39;s not in the salad). 

Also, if you have a problem with your Potbelly experience, if you go onto their website and let them know, they&#39;ll do something about it (I know for a fact they then go to district and store managers with customer feedback), and they reward you with two free sandwiches for your bad experience.

I Just stopped by to order a sandwich to go. The girl making my sandwich was very rude and acted as if I was a bother to her and making my sandwich was interfering with her day. She wasn&#39;t even listening to my order and gave me a rude look when I told her I didn&#39;t want tomatoes. Lastly she went to put my sandwich in the toaster and I told her I don&#39;t want it toasted and she rolled her eyes at me. I have been a very loyal customer to Pot Bellys and their food is delicious but it&#39;s a shame they hire employees that think it is ok to be rude to their customers.

Chicken Salad Salad --I love this salad....the chicken is soft and tastes different than any other chicken salads I&#39;ve had...everything in this salad with the house dressing tastes great!! you should try it...:)

Sandwiches -- I&#39;ve tried them in the past.. and they all tastes good. YUM.

Portion: Salad/Sandwich--they give you a lot so you can eat it in one sitting (and be content) or in two sittings (if you don&#39;t eat a lot).. 

Atmosphere: great to go with friends and family (kid friendly)...it&#39;s like Chiptole, but with sandwiches instead of burritos... :) 

Customer Service: the staff are typically friendly..

Costs: reasonable --under $10 or more than $10 if you order drinks &amp; chips..

Parking: during busy hours, it might be harder to find parking..

Sooo....sometimes I come to beat the rush around 11...but...that music! It&#39;s worth the wait I would say for a chill and somewhat eventful lunch.

I usually go for a Skinny Sandwich, either the Mushroom Melt or the Hammie (Ham &amp; Cheese). Both of which are very good and low in calories so they don&#39;t make me feel so bad about ordering a chocolate shake with it! Yep, I&#39;m one of those people...Give me the most fattening thing on the menu and a diet coke please! Every calorie counts right? :D Their chocolate shakes are just fantastic...so thick the way I like them. I just can&#39;t pass it up!

Great for a sub but a bit on the pricier end of other sandwich stores I know like Subway and Jimmy John&#39;s. But I&#39;d still recmomend it because they do grilled sandwiches better than most. Their strawberry shakes are great. I like them better than Steak &#39;n Shake and most other shake places (though the best in the area is still Paradise Pup).

As far as hot subs go, Potbelly is my all time favorite (Jersey Mike&#39;s is my first choice for traditional cold subs). The bread at Potbelly, both the white and the wheat are great. All the meats are delicious, especially the Italian meats. I recommend the turkey, Italian (cappicolla, salami, pepperoni and mortadella. Great with marinara sauce), and the wreck (ham, turkey, and salami). They also have great cookies and their own hot peppers for the subs. Bonus points for the atmosphere!"

This, among many other reasons, is why they&#39;re fantastic:
I ordered a Wreck on wheat, no cheese. When it came out of the oven, it apparently had cheese on it. The awesome dude behind the counter expediting the dressing of sandwiches asked what I ordered and upon telling him, he merely asked if I was lactose intolerant. Why yes, yes I am! Now, it is important to note that most people in the food industry act as though me asking for my meal sans cheese is a chore and a pain in their rear. Not Mr. Super-Cool-Sandwich-Guy. He simply asked what condiments I would like on my sandwich and had it remade. No questions asked and he didn&#39;t expect me to &#34;just pick it off&#34; as has been suggested to me many a time at other restaurants.

Tried the lettuce wraps and a California veggie pizza as well. Pizza wasn&#39;t the greatest, and thats probably just me, as my family enjoyed the taste. 
Tried some wine as well, Pinot Noir, which is one of my favorites. 
The ambience was good, not many people for a Saturday evening. The staff not so bad. The service a bit slow, as our server kept on disappearing.

1. The place looks decent - it&#39;s nothing like a regular pizzeria (that I expected)
2. We had a great service! Sergio was our waiter. He was very polite, knew what he was talking about, tried to be useful and was around when we needed him :)
3. The place was 60% occupied on Tuesday night!

I ordered crispy thin crust Sicilian pizza - it had plenty of salami, less Italian sausage, less than that spicy Capicola ham, and almost no cheese. It was &#34;crispy thin&#34; though as promised :).

My fiance ordered Shrimp Scampi Zucchini and Asparagus + Arugula Salad. Sergio brought the main dish nicely designed in a huge plate. I think she enjoyed it. I tried some of both dishes - it was fine (not in my alley - I like sweet or creamy, it was a bit sour - that&#39;s exactly how she likes it ;-).

Here for lunch.  Nice, bright atmosphere.  Everything we saw go by looked delicious and all of the patrons looked happy.  I ordered a Moscow Mule to drink and we both ordered a lunch combo.  About $10 each.

Bit of a hitch with that drink.  After a lonnnng wait I cancelled the order.  Our server never stopped by to address the delay.  The drink showed up shortly after my cancellation, offered for no charge.  Nice.  It was good...very gingery.

I had a chicken and brie 1/2 sandwich and some sort of Greek salad.  Very yummy.  That half sandwich is huge.  Two people could easily split a full sandwich here.  My daughter had a 1/2 club and a potato soup that she love, love, loved.

I saw on Yelp that California Pizza Kitchen had free WiFi, so I decided to have dinner there too. I told the hostess that I would be on my laptop and she, thankfully, put me at the last table in the back. I didn&#39;t like that it was right next to the kitchen, but I did like that I was away from other people eating.

I can&#39;t remember my server&#39;s name, but she was super friendly and helpful. I had a couple of questions about things on the menu and she was able to answer them all. I usually order the white pizza, but she recommended the wild mushroom pizza. I still like the white pizza more (with bacon), but the mushroom pizza with truffle oil was good too.

It never fails, though, that every time I know I&#39;m going to want dessert at a restaurant, my server fails to ask me if I want to order some. She brought my check before asking if I wanted dessert and had to take it away because I ended up ordering the Butter Cake which was amazing.

We just had the small guacamole appetizer, which was good - very small, but to be fair it was very inexpensive. 

We then decided when in Rome - and ordered a pizza. Went with the wild mushroom (no truffle oil topping) and I was pretty happy with it. I liked that the crust was light and that they didn&#39;t skimp on the mushroom toppings. 

We decided that splitting these two items between the two of us was pretty perfect. I&#39;m always looking for that balance of eating enough, but not going over board and feeling too full to do anything the rest of the day. 

The service was decent, it was pretty quiet at this location. They kept coming around to check if we had the bill ready when we were sitting chatting (even after we had been told by two separate associates there was no rush mind you!)  which was a little annoying, especially since it wasn&#39;t as though there weren&#39;t a ton of table open for other customers."

We ordered the tostada pizza and my favorite, the tequila lime chicken fettuccine with extra sauce.  We also ordered some of their habanero salsa on the side.  When the pizza arrived, the wife noticed the crust was different than in the past.  John told us that they changed the crust on the tostada pizza, but he gladly offered to make a new pizza on the crust we favored... awesome!

Just came back an hour ago. We came as a party of 11 to celebrate my brother&#39;s birthday. As we walked in this short haired blonde woman who was supposed to be the greeter completely ignored us. We approached her to tell her we were here as a party of 11 and she was overall indifferent and seemed to have some complexities and a power struggle because she wanted to seat us at separate tables and refused to push them in together. She didn&#39;t e plain why they couldn&#39;t be pushed together and claimed that a larger area would be an hour late---keep in mind we were the only ones waiting and this was at 8:30 and the restaurant was not ridiculously busy at all for a Friday night. She then didn&#39;t even escort us to the table...she basically just pointed the table out to us. Completely rude and unacceptable.

Our server was very kind and another server or manager saw what was going on and he offered to push the two tables together. The food was just fine and very standard for what cpk is.

The manager was making rounds to ask everyone how they were enjoying the food and how everything was going. He seemed to completely ignore our table---the huge table of 11. Don&#39;t know how he can miss us but he somehow totally did...

We tipped very generously as our server was kind. Overall though---I was disgusted by the rude demeanor of the manager and the &#34;greeter.&#34;"

Going to any pizza place and ordering a pizza without cheese is always a fun experience. You sort of feel like everyone in the restaurant turns and looks at you when you order. But, none the less, I ordered their &#34;Works&#34; pizza with no cheese.

The service was very slow. We were the first to arrive at the restaurant at 11AM on a Sunday, and five tables received their meals before we did. The server was pleasant enough, but I have no idea why it took so long.

Fortunately, their beverage service is free flowing. Right now they serve Pepsi products but the server made a strong point that they were changing to Coke products in two weeks.

He told me he would be putting me down for the party room for that Saturday. I was grateful and happy - until I arrived at the restaurant that Saturday.
I walked in the restaurant early to start my small decorating process for their party room. I told the hostess who I was and reservation info. She gave me the &#34;oh crap&#34; face and got the manager. The &#34;manager&#34; first said he didn&#39;t have staff for their party room?!?! and then told me he had no information on my event?!?

The manager then led me back to their &#34;room&#34; and said this isn&#39;t how they normally do things yada yada.

The items that I remember trying are the fettucini, mac &amp; cheese, garlic chicken pizza, thai pizza, thai salad, bbq pizza. I remember that they were good, but not great.

That was years ago though. Today, we had their chicken &amp; shrimp lettuce wraps ($12.75) and works thin crust pizza ($15.25). 

Lettuce wraps - 2.5 stars. Good, but not worth $13

Works pizza - 1 star at that price. The crust was crisp on the edges (good), floppy elsewhere. It reminded me of a non-toasted tortilla, in a bad way. Cheese and sauce were a huge letdown. Flavorless cheese and not enough sauce! I only ate a few bites of my slice. The max I would pay is $10, but even then, it&#39;d rate lower than Home Run Inn&#39;s frozen pizza that I&#39;d get for $6.

Easily can make a better pizza. Can probably buy a better frozen pizza too, which shouldn&#39;t be the case for a restaurant that has the word &#39;pizza&#39; in its name lol. The service was good, but then there were only two other tables at that time."

Even the salads are very good, especially the roasted veg salad is full of flavor and very filling.  

As far as the service at Schaumburg, we have been very happy every time we have visited.  The Ice Tea is very good, and they never let your glass go empty.  The desserts leave a lot to be desired.  We tried the brownie Sunday and a caramel dessert, both of which were mediocre."

It&#39;s not like they had a special limited menu to pick four items from. NO. They happily repeated, &#34;Any meal you want, left side, go ahead, its all free.&#34; I was so impressed! 

Now the drink I had to cover. No problem. As I waited for the pizza to finish and reminisce with another veteran I happen to serve with in &#39;06, they refilled my drink with ease until I took off with my pizza, they made sure my drink was full.

They thanked me and gave me a generous meal. Would have paid $15. 

Never had I been taken care of so well for Veteran&#39;s day. Of all the different chain restaurant/places I&#39;ve been to in the past few years, this place is the best!

The bean sprouts and carrots were excellent - clean and crunchy. I would have liked the thin crust to have been a bit crisper. The strawberry and watermelon fields salad was great - the dressing blending in with the fruit instead of overwhelming it. I would have liked to have seen the waiter a bit more - I didn&#39;t get a refill of water until I was almost done with my meal although he was pleasant when he did come by. An extra napkin or two when the meal was served would have been nice since pizza is a finger food. Great atmosphere and enjoyed the background music too. The hostess was very gracious in assisting me with seating. For a &#34;pizza&#34; place, a little on the pricey side but I guess the uniqueness and quality comes with a bit of a premium - the salad (half portion) and pizza (I did order whole grain and thin crust which was extra) and no drinks came up to $32 with tip."

Chicken quesodila (sp chk) from their small plate menu. it was tasty but overpriced for $5 for 4 small triangles.
Hawaiian BBQ pizza- the star of the dinner. Ive had it frozen but never fresh and I would definitely go back for more! Im excited to try their other pizzas.
Fish tacos - i am a fish taco feen and unfortunately both my favorite locations to get fish tacos are no longer serving it. This was the worst of the items we ordered. The cabbage that came on top was quite bitter and there was just not enough flavor from the fish, coleslaw or ranchito sauce.
Broccoli and sundried tomato pasta- our waitress accidentally brought us the  tomato basil dish, which looked quite appetizing. She was the one who suggested we get the broccoli and tomato pasta. well she corrected the error.

The on call manager Bruce Marvin needs to be re-educated in customer service. We have been going to this location for over 5 years, &amp; almost every time my wife orders the fish tacos with a simple substitution of their salsa &amp; chips for a side Caesar salad at no extra charge. Bruce is under the impression that this dish priced $10.75 should have a $2 up charge for the salad, when other sandwich dishes offer the salad as a side item already. He stated bluntly &amp; rudely that the up charge had something to do with their price point cost difference. I know from my experience that the salad&#39;s ingredients are cheaper than the salsa and chips, when purchased in bulk from the supplier. 

I have ample experience as a restaurant manager from my days at Denny&#39;s, obviously &#34;the customer is always right,&#34; does not apply for this restaurant. I refuse to pay their stupid up charge. We simply got up and left. I hope you get retrained or let go Bruce.

My boyfriend lived in Santa Cruz, CA for many years. He knows California cuisine. We also dine out a lot (not always worthy of a yelp mention) so we know the value of a meal.

You don&#39;t tell the guy the chicken is not a full breast but merely chicken strips in a sandwich! Then add insult to injury by not offering a complimentary side dish when he decides to order the Chicken Piccata.

I&#39;m not saying he was expecting compensation. Most places you order an entree, it includes a side dish.  Here, you get a soup or salad included with a sandwich but you get nothing for ordering an entree like the Chicken Piccata that is comparable in price.

The service is good, though very &#34;standardized&#34;. You can always tell when corporate has started dictating service standards because they all sound the same and you really don&#39;t get personalities anymore. I can&#39;t imagine they have the kind of fun working here now as when they first opened stores almost 30 years ago. The food here is always good even though they tend to add/remove dishes alot. They&#39;ve lost some good dishes - Cajun Pizza, Black Bean Angel Hair. My biggest problem with CPK now is I no longer can afford to eat here as often as I&#39;d like. I used to go once a week but now I just go every few months. Their prices are crazy - $10 for a half salad?? Pasta dishes for $13+. Every thing has gone through the roof. Those tiny little flatbread things are like $5 or $6. Every time owner ship changes the prices go up to feed a new crop of overpaid execs I guess. Started with the founders Rick and Larry and it was a little high, but I didn&#39;t see a price hike for years. And then Pepsico got involved, then sold it back to Rick and Larry, and now its been sold a time or two to some restaurant corps. I&#39;m giving 4 stars for really good food and service and not 5 because of their prices."

We started with Cocktails which were just average and &#39;expensive&#39; $9 for an average cocktail is not value. I switched to beer for next glass and it was about $6 for a pint.. so you get the idea... Starter was a flat bread with lots of cheese... again very average.. I was thinking probably the visit was first and last and then the main course came and I understood why it was crowded.

Pizzas were awesome, I ordered roasted pulled pork with hot herbano salsa... one word &#39;Awesome&#39;.. Wifey ordered some veggie option.. again it was great, we couldnt finish so got in the pizza boxes.. good quantity and great quality.. price was about  $12 each so I can see some value

Service was slow but we were not in hurry and wanted to spend some time in lively atmosphere there so no complaints... Waitress did ok service , was probably a bit in hurry... 

Overall fine experience, will go there again for pizza but will skip starter or cocktails.."

The pizza/other food was great, the service was leaving something to be desired.  Anytime we asked for something (like silverware...) we were told, oh yeah, I&#39;ll be right back, and then would never come back.  This happened with the silverware, plates, parmesan cheese, and my friends&#39; correct pizza (because he got it wrong the first time).

In any case, they don&#39;t make the amazing Tostada pizza anymore.  Super bummer.

The fried macaroni and cheese was great, the bang bang shrimp was just OK (Bonefish grill is a million times better!) and our pizzas were good.  You know, once they were corrected.  I got the pizza with about a million different meats on it, and it was awesome, and my friend got the Hawaiian chicken pizza which was delicious as well.  

We didn&#39;t save enough room for dessert, but they did look awesome.  So if I ever go back, I shall order that first!! :)"

We have been frequent diners for a long time.  However, recently while eating the leftovers of the veggie salad at work (we ate there for lunch), I found a rock, and I mean A ROCK (I still have it in a bag) in my salad.  I bit down on it.  I feel very fortunate that I did not break a tooth.  I&#39;m do not know if it was in my salad originally, or if found its way, (perhaps via the floor), into the takeout container, but it was in my salad. 

While this is clearly not a good thing, the worst thing about this, is that I alerted the corporate office, and NOTHING was done by the company.  I felt this was important for the company to know, for everyone&#39;s sake (Safety).  Corporate did take my call, and supposedly alerted the store in Schaumburg.  I was told by the corporate office that I would hear back &#34;shortly&#34; from the store itself.  

I have not heard back from the Schaumburg store, and it&#39;s been nearly a month.  I wrote back to corporate, just to let them know that Schaumburg never bothered to deal with this matter, and I haven&#39;t even heard back from them.  

While I will miss eating at CPK, since the company does not handle matters properly, we will no longer eat at any CPK.  We just have too many options.  Lettuce Entertain You restaurants would have never handled (or not at all!) a situation like this.  We are willing to pay the money to eat at quality, better-run restaurants."

I&#39;m more of a deep dish Giordanos, Pequods, Lous, Ginos East type of guy, but since I&#39;ve never been here, I decided to give it a shot.

Ordered a jerk chicken pizza with bits of bacon, chicken and veggies on it.  It was ok, but didn&#39;t really blow my socks off.  Was a bit lacking with the sauce, but overall, not really sure I&#39;d order it again.  It really sort of made me not really want to try any other pizza on the menu.  

I ordered Korean steak tacos... (who does that at a pizza joint??).  Evidently, I was on some weird stuff that day, but I did it anyway.  It was actually not bad, however for two small tacos and almost 6 bucks, it&#39;s really not worth it.

What really surprised me was the garlic cream fettuccine with shrimp and chicken.  My wife and I found ourselves chowing down on that more than the pizza, appetizers or anything else.  It was actually quite good.

Overall, I should have probably just gone somewhere else for pasta, which was really what I didn&#39;t come here for.  It&#39;s ok though.  It was a decent meal.  

Liked the key lime pie..."

However, lots of people have raved about this place and I had to find out for myself.

Went here on a weekday during the dinner hours.  It appeared pretty busy but we were seated in less then 5 minutes.  This restaurant is located across the streets from Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg.  So it can get quite busy.

Nice clean place... very family style and lots of kids.  Lots of booths.

We ordered korean steak tacos for appetizer.  Which was ok.  I don&#39;t know if I will order them again.  But was something interesting that popped at me when I first read the menu.  It was actually $6 for 2 very small tacos.  When it was served, I almost wanted to say.. &#34;thats it?&#34; 

For our main dish, we ordered a jerk chicken pizza and a fettucine with shrimp and chicken.  The pizza was thin crust and was ok.  Chicken kinda dry and was just missing some sauce.  However, the fettucine was awesome.  Who would&#39;ve thunk!!! Was nice and creamy... that gave u that warm homely feeling.  The shrimp and chicken was cooked perfect.  Made everything melt in your mouth. 

We also had a dessert here.  We chose their key lime pie... and I must say, it was pretty good.   I may have to come here and try another pizza and see if I like it.  

But will definitely give the key lime pie and the pasta a go again."

We haven&#39;t been to CPK in a while and it seemed like it would be a nice change of pace from the typical places we go.
Gotta say, they&#39;ve upped their game since the last time I was there.

We split a nice white corn guacamole appetizer and a really tasty roasted artichoke and spinach pizza.   Some interesting and unique food, done well.

The guac was fresh and the flavors on the pizza were really excellent.  Full without being overpowering.
I was really pleased with each dish and the meal overall.

The server kept trying to talk us into multiple appetizers and said the pizzas were too much for one person.  Not sure if they were just telling servers to push apps or what.   There were only two of us, so we had no need for multiple appetizers.  In addition to the one app,  we shared a goat cheese/pepper pizza which ended up being really good and the perfect portion size for two people.  It wasn&#39;t very warm though...

We also got the dumplings which weren&#39;t cooked all the way and tasted really bland til you dipped them in the sauce that comes with it.  The glasses and plates all seemed a bit greasy like they weren&#39;t washed very well....this alone grosses me out. 

We sat down about 15 minutes before the two tables next to us and they were finishing their pizzas by the time we got ours.  And both of those tables had apps too...but a different server.

Let me give this place an unusual comment.. Usually at EVERY cpk you get the sourdough bread with some packets for solid cement frozen butter packets.. This place actually had room temp packets. I liked that for once... :)

Yes there are more &#34;authentic&#34; places you can go and try gourmet pizzas, but CPK is like an old friend.  I know what to expect when I go.  My all time favorites: Tostada pizza, 5-Cheese and Fresh Tomato pizza (but only with Cholula sauce added on top), Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, and the Chocolate Souffle Cake a la mode.

I was going to give you a two star reviews but I recanted because the aftertaste of the food still made me nauseous and that does not deserve a 2 star review.  

Yesterday was quite a chilly day, about 40s and when I went into the restaurant, it felt like the same temperature. Weird? Everybody must have thought the same thing because they were all wearing their coats while eating.  That&#39;s a big No No in any establishment, being cold while eating food. I even had hot tea to keep warm. 

Food: The white bean minestrone soup was pretty good, nice flavor and a hint of tanginess. I also got the white pizza and the garlic chicken pizza. Initially, we have high hopes for this place. Rejoicing in the memory of how good the pizza tasted a couple of years ago.  For $12 a pizza, it must taste good right? Wrong!!!  The pizza came out unordinary, in a regular dish and it looked unappealing altogether. Like someone else said in their review, seems like reheated frozen pizza.  In terms of taste, it was bland and uneatable. After 2 slices I felt rather nauseous and I had to force myself to eat some of it because I&#39;m going to pay for it. Man, it was horrible. I usually don&#39;t give bad reviews but this really deserved it. 

Best part of the experience: We left! Maybe next time, I&#39;ll stick to Chicago Pizza type of kitchens!"

My server, Bobbie, was very attentive which I always appreciate. The servers who show up once to take an order, once to drop food off, and once to get the bill are not the type I&#39;ve experienced here.

I usually get the the California club, liked it better when they had the Asian slaw as the side instead of soup or salad option they have now.

I got a white pizza instead, it was fine, nothing great. The service was a little slow and our waitress was a bit rude.

This restaurant is, pretty much, one big open space. So the noise level is usually pretty high. Our server was quick and friendly. I haven&#39;t tried the pizzas, but the salads are fair. Get the dressing on the side unless you want your salad to have more calories and fat than the pizza."

Also have very good Belgian waffles. And here&#39;s the kicker: if you want seriously good potato  pancakes with apple sauce and sour cream, the best ones in the Heights are here.

My Chicken Cobb Salad was just like any salad... My son orders King Club (he loved it) but thats not why Im writing this review. 2 stars for food because I felt insulted... 
So we were at local pottery place my son was finishing his project and I desperately needed coffee. So as I was driving looking for Starbucks, saw the Uptown Cafe, went in there and a very nice girl just poured me coffee to go and didnt charge me anything... That was a pleasant surprise... I left feeling pleasantly surprised and definitely was coming back for lunch... 15 mins later... Brought my son after he finished his project and we ordered our lunch. We ate. So the waitress Christine brings me check ... 4 items. I question her what did she bill me for... So she says: salad, king club, root beer and COFFEE to go... I asked her: how do you know if I didnt pay for it 30 mins before or was given it for free... And she was surprised oh ah eh... Standard BS she could come up. I said : fine I&#39;ll pay for it... Her response: are you sure? Uhm no Im NOT sure! I said I&#39;ll pay for it. So the reason I came back because a previous girl was humanly nice to me. It touched me, I came back for lunch JUST BECAUSE SHE GAVE ME FREE COFFEE... After Christine charged for free coffee... I aint coming THERE again! It was a sad sad insult! I expected a little different response from Christine... I hope the owner points it out to her... And maybe teach her a little better customer service... She seems in a rush... But hey...

first off, the menu was pregnant with choices for breakfast, so much so that i was, for a few moments, paralyzed by the possibilities.my meal mate and i soon agreed trying and sharing would be the best way to sample as much as possible.

we orders blintzes and they were intoxicating! the server recommended we only get a half order as they were pretty big and she was spot on. i appreciated her honesty of not trying to oversell us on buying more food than we needed.

the greek omlette was light, fluffy and almost perfect (albeit, slightly salty). the pancakes light and fluffy, and it tasted like real maple syrup. the plates were displayed very well, the young waitresses were quick ,efficient and had no attitude. the ambiance was great. i like being around others when eating out and this place will continue to be popular as long as they continue to crank out great food."

The place is family owned and run for somewhere around 20 years.   You don&#39;t stay in the restaurant business that long without doing a lot right.  They want you to be happy and if you are not happy with a food item, you tell them and they will make it right for you!!  On Sat and Sun you may have to wait for a table.

i&#39;ve had the chorizo eggs benedict and corned beef hash with eggs. the chorizo on the eggs benedict totally overwhelmed it and it was all i could really taste. the corned beef hash was mushy and just not good. got my eggs scrambled and i like them to be a little fluffier than they were. regular hash browns were a little on the bland and not too crispy side. pancakes were okay but a little dry.

i guess it&#39;s regular diner food and i&#39;d definitely still come here if it were the only option. but there&#39;s at least one other place within a block or two that&#39;s much better. i really did like my waitress though. she was really sweet and attentive, but it just can&#39;t really make up for the food. it&#39;s just not somewhere i&#39;d be compelled to go back."

The number one thing that my husband and adore here are the soups. I choose which day to come based on the soup of the day. They are all amazing, but try to come on a Thursday for the mushroom barley soup, or on Saturday for the split pea (topped with amazing buttery croutons). We dream about the soup here. It beats anything else on the menu (although of course we order other stuff too). The only &#34;soup&#34; I don&#39;t love here is the chili, which is good but way too thick for my liking. 

They have monthly specials (my favorite ever was the cannoli crepes they had in March) and it&#39;s nice to have new flavors available all the time while still having all the standards if that&#39;s what you love. 

They do close at 3:00pm, at even start &#34;closing up shop&#34; even before that if the crowd is slow, so I wouldn&#39;t expect to get there just before 3 and still get service (I can&#39;t say they wouldn&#39;t, I haven&#39;t experienced that, I&#39;ve just seen them start to close at 2:30). 

This place is not fancy or cutting-edge, but for traditional breakfast options with a couple of great specials, it&#39;s an awesome place. The owners are really friendly too!"

... said no one ever.
... until me today. 

Located inside Northwest Community Hospital&#39;s surgery wing (through entrance 2), this coffee shop and bakery was as decent a caliber as any Caribou Coffee ever was. Free wifi, plenty of seating, pre-made but still fresh sandwiches, DELICIOUS chocolate croissants, and damn fine caffeinated beverages and teas. 

I got a 20oz latte and two big chocolate croissants and my bill was around $7, which I thought was a great price considering all that at Starbucks easily would have run me over $12. 

There&#39;s also a really nice outdoor area with some bench seating and a beautiful winding garden path. 

Honestly, this might be my favorite coffee shop in the area."

However, Rosa J. made it work and found &#34;Taqueria Los Laureles&#34; inside a tiny supermercado in Rolling Meadows, not too far from the Woodfield business/shopping districts.  She literally went through three (3) pages worth of Yelp search because she wanted something inexpensive with a local flare.  

This place is mainly &#34;solo para llevar,&#34; but there are five (5) chairs available for patrons choose to dine in.  Hubby and I ordered two (2) gorditas de asada, two (2) tacos de chile relleno, and two (2) horchatas medianas.  The total came to $19 and some change.  

The steak was made fresh, which I could see what the cook was making in action.  The Mexican police soap opera kept everyone entertained.  It was a bit funny and occasionally over the top.  Nevertheless, my Spanish is still at the elementary level and didn&#39;t fully understand every line.

Hubby was glad that the chile relleno taco was available for those who want non-meat options.  The only minor complaint I had was the corn masa pocket was slightly dry, and the horchata could use a bit more cinnamon to balance out the &#34;sugary&#34; taste.  

Nevertheless, I was glad that this little taqueria exists in the suburbs because we were about to end up at a &#34;Pa*da Expre*s&#34; for lunch."

I have been here twice now and have ordered the chicken gordita and taco. The food is so amazing here!! The prices were pretty standard as well. If it were healthier, i would come here all day everyday.  They cook everything fresh and right before your very eyeeess. woooo!

It&#39;s inside of a grocery store and I would have never known of its existence if it wasn&#39;t for you awesome yelpers. I ordered myself a burrito for $5 for lunch last week. It was stellar. Very fresh, the steak was flavorful and tender and did I mention the burrito was huge? I couldn&#39;t finish it and ate the rest the next day. It was still good although I microwaved it.

This is definitely not a sit down type place although there is a counter with some chairs where you can eat what you&#39;ve ordered. Seating is limited so it&#39;s more of a grab n go. 

I love this place, I want to try their tacos next.

Although the ambiance of this place might throw you off, don&#39;t let that defer you from the amazing food!

Edit: Just came here  a second time for lunch again because I was dying to try their tacos. I ordered one pastor, one chorizo, and the third was barbacoa. I really enjoyed the pastor and barbacoa. The barbacoa tasted the best, I will definitely be ordering that one again. The pastor was delicious as well. Both were very juicy but not to the point where it destroys the taco. The chorizo was good but not great, I&#39;ve had better. 

What I like most about this place is that it&#39;s 100% authentic. I can&#39;t name a lot of places around the suburbs that think to give you lime with your tacos although that should be a standard thing always. 

The tacos were huge as well and I&#39;m not sure if it was because it was lunch time, but I bought three tacos for $7 and got a can of pop as well. 

I am definitely going to be a returning customer."

Let me be honest, I&#39;m always just a tiny bit skeptical when I try and find a Mexican restaurant or taqueria like this place and don&#39;t see any reviews by any Spanish yelpers!  Lol all in good fun though.  But I always have to think how authentic because a place like El Sombrero that I reviewed is the furtherest thing away from Mexican food. It&#39;s kinda like that hot sauce from New York city!

Moving on from my side comments and history trying to find gems in the suburbs...this is definitely an authentic Mexican taqueria (meaning what&#39;s served is likely limited to tacos, tortas and burritos and of course rice and beans). It&#39;s a small little grocery store that reminds me of a few of those little shops on the south side I grew up in.  On the back corner is their restaurant.

The price is pretty cheap, especially for the portions you get.  The food is not the bet but it is pretty darn good.  Very tasty and filling.  Their carne asada is okay but I like the Milanesa (breaded steak).  Try this place out, it doesn&#39;t disappoint.

We have been several times in the last couple of weeks and have tried the Cecina, Lomo, carne asada, Al pastor, carnitas, Barbacoa, Napolitas asada (cactus), and the grilled peppers and onions- all worth repeating.  
I realized how great  los laureles was when I returned to my prior favorite taco stand and found the flavors there to be lacking.
I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more!
Leagua is my next taco to try.....

Bonus is while I wait I can pick up a few Mexican  pantry items that they don&#39;t carry at the European Markets or Mariano&#39;s since its a taco counter in a small grocery store.

As a note about the service.  It&#39;s a taco counter in a mercato - so no white linen service but the nice guy with text book perfect English is fun to chat with and when the very nice lady that didn&#39;t know any English took my boyfriends order and he was ordering Napolitas asada and I was trying to tell him it was cactus and he didn&#39;t believe me she could someone that could explain it to him.  Super helpful.
Just pretend your on the beach in Mexico and try to use the local language and you&#39;ll do just fine.

We will definitely be back for more"

Carne asada tacos are seasoned well and the quality of the meat is above average compared to other Taquerias in the local area.  Other stand outs are the chicken and carnitas tacos.  The sauces they give with with your meal are very good:  green being on the spicier side - red having a bit more flavor and less heat.  Only gripe is that you are limited to a certain selection of tacos for their taco special (3 tacos plus a can of pop for $5.99) with the asada not one of them.  Small complaint for what is otherwise great inexpensive food.

It is a tiny grocery store and the take out place is in the back right corner.  The menu consists of burritos, tacos and tortas (I have no idea what a torta is).
Burittos are 4.99, tacos are 1.75 (best deal is 3 w/ can of pop for $5), and I have no idea what a torta is lol. (went yesterday so prices are estimates)
I had the burrito and my gf got 2 tacos (which she thought was a quesidilla but I will go into more details on that a little later)
My burrito was godly, the menu is pretty barebones in terms of describing what the heck is actually in the burrito.  I took a few bites of it and was a little disappointed that it did not have what I thought should be in a burrito (beans and rice).  Thank goodness it didn&#39;t have that bull crap because it would have taken away real estate from the glorious glorious meat.  I got the al pastor (which is marinated port, I am a huge pork lover) and it was the best meat I have ever had.  It was delicious.  I am not a big foodie so I decide what tastes delicious by how much I want another bite, and Oh how I wanted bite after bite.  The burrito was comprised of lettuce, grilled onions, tomatoes (which I hate and would have asked for them to remove if it was listed on the menu, but again the menu is literally Burrito - al Pastor... and nothing else!), and meat the glorious meat.  Next time I go I am going to get the 3 taco combo so I can try other types of meat cuz goodness gracious it was good.  The burrito itself was not big but it was so good.  In terms of value, I would say it is just as good as those other burrito places (Moe&#39;s Mondays might be a better value since it is a bigger burrito w/ drinks and chips but it does not compare in taste at all).
My gf got two &#34;quesidillas&#34; it was located at the bottom of the taco section.  So she thought they were going to be quesidillas but they were quesidilla tacos so she could have gotten the 3 taco deal and had a good old time.  But anyways, she absolutely loved them and she loves this place more than Qdoba (which is her go to &#34;Mexican&#34; food place, she goes all the time to that terrible place).  Even though she did not get a quesidilla she still loves the place more than Qdoba, quite an accomplishment.
We both had a hard time of ordering since we do not speak spanish.  I think of it as part of the fun, I do not think she liked that aspect as much as I did.  
In sum,  this place is awesome.  It is located in the strip mall on Algonquin along with China 1 and a Dunkin&#39; Robbins.  Funny thing is that it is located right next to an actual sit down Mexican Restaurant, screw that I am going to the grocery store for my restaurant needs!
I love mexican food but I am no means an expert when it comes to this delicacy.  So come try it out if you are not a taco snob.  It is delicious and if anything it is cool to look at all of the different mixes of canned beans there is in the world while your food is being prepared (that was not a racist comment, the counter is directly across from the beans and canned jalapeños section, if you were curious there is a can that has beans and jalapeños in one can, real crazy)."

My wife ordered 2 lomo (ribeye), and received 1 lomo (good) and 1 skirt steak (not so good).  I liked the lengua (tongue) and the cabeza (head meat).  The al pastor was not good.  The sauce was more of a paste of dry spices and a little liquid.  The chiccaron (pork rinds) pretty much ruined my meal.  It was not crispy like I&#39;ve had other places.  It was mushy and chewy at the same time.  It seemed to have been boiled instead of deep fried.  But the worst part about the chiccaron is that it was incredibly spicy.  I had no desire to finish it, but would not have been able to if I wanted to.  And I actually like spicy foods.

The reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 2 is the chiccaron that I bought from the meat counter.  It&#39;s fantastic!  It&#39;s both seasoned and cooked perfectly, and has nice chunks of meat as well.  I will go back just for more of that.  If only they put that in the tacos.  They call these pork cracklins in the south and they&#39;re hard to find around here.  If you&#39;ve never had them, I highly recommend it.  It&#39;s salty, bacony, fatty, crispy, all at the same time.  So good, and certainly so bad for you.  

Overall this place is just ok as a taqueria (as long as you stick to the more tame varieties).  With so many other great places, I won&#39;t be going back here for tacos.  But the rest of the store has some good and hard to find treats."

As far as fast food for chicken is concerned, KFC gets my top vote with Boston Market being second and Popeyes being third. I normally go there during lunch on Sunday after church. So I don&#39;t deal with the problems that other reviewers experienced.


Menu (7/10)
It&#39;s standard KFC offerings.

Price (7/10)
It&#39;s standard KFC prices. The portion size is as expected.

Ambiance (7/10)
Nothing too fancy, but nothing too bad either. The restaurant is spacey and bright, but they definitely can do better on cleaning the floor and bathrooms. Their selection on tile and grout color is just awful in my opinion. If that&#39;s KFC&#39;s standard, shame on the corporate office.

Service (7/10)
It&#39;s mixed for me. On some days, I had to wait in a long line and there&#39;s only one cashier. Other days, I wanted to order something and they gave me extra chicken/corn because they didn&#39;t get it right the first time or I had to wait for a few minutes. Then other days, there was absolutely no line and I get exactly what I wanted. Overall, I usually don&#39;t leave being disappointed.

Location (9/10)
It&#39;s convenient for my purpose (Sunday lunch) because it&#39;s close to my church and on the way home.

Overall score: 7/10"

Normally when I go to KFC I get the four piece original wing with mashed potatoes, an extra biscuit and a Mt Dew.  I will admit, for fast food, I don&#39;t write too many reviews because they&#39;re typically the same but this place actually motivated me to write them a review.

I ordered the chicken at 6:30 and got home by 6:45.  The chicken was like nothing I ever had before.  It was mushy, consistent with a type of bland pudding.  I don&#39;t think they used all 13 secret spices because it had no taste.  The wings were just mush with bones protruding out of them.  In fact I considered taking a bite of the bone in hopes to get some flavor from the marrow.  I only managed to eat one wing of the four.

Then I went to the mashed potatoes--after all how can anyone screw up a mashed potato, especially the instant ones.  And since it had brown gravy, my heart was filled with glee.  Unfortunately it too had no flavor.  In fact I couldn&#39;t tell the difference between the gravy and the potatoes.  It was like eating palpitated newspaper with brown water puddled on top.

Overall I would highly suggest finding some other place to eat.  A garbage dumpster perhaps.  The food was completely uneatable and its only saving grace was the Mt Dew.  I had no complaints about the Mt Dew.  It was spot on."

The biscuit I got which was in that container was soaked in that grease. This Nashville Hot Chicken is nothing but a greasy salty nasty hot mess. These Nashville Hot Chicken are I&#39;m sure perfect for anyone who has been out all night drinking and is looking for anything to eat at 3am in the morning, other than that and you need to have a craving for salt, grease and bad spice mix.

Really? There is a sign posted in the drive thru stating this so it wasn&#39;t a surprise (other than not knowing about it until I read the sign)
 I understand that there are card processing fees to merchants when customers use a credit or debit card to make a purchase, but I&#39;ve never been charged a surcharge for using my card at a fast food restaurant.  And why do they only charge this on debit cards and not credit cards?  Actually they shouldn&#39;t be charging extra fees for any card use.

Skip going to this Kentucky Fried Chicken. You will live a happier life and hate the world less.

This is especially true if you are looking for fried chicken around the dinner hour, since this location is routinely out of chicken by 5pm. Way to plan ahead for the biggest meal of the day, guys. Well done.

And hey, who doesn&#39;t like going for take out, coming home, and learning that your order is fundamentally wrong or that there are items missing that you paid for? To be fair, it&#39;s always smart to double check any take out order. That said, the only thing consistent about this KFC is that they are incapable of getting your order right at any time- even when you tell them &#34;you got our order wrong last time....&#34; Given the somewhat limited scope of their menu, the lack of accuracy is fairly shocking.

You know, I saw on National Geographic once that when lions are hunting an antelope and a crocodile nabs it first, the lion walks away from his delicious meal. Why? It&#39;s just not worth the trouble. The pain and suffering he&#39;d have to go through to get his food outweighs the annoyance of going elsewhere for a meal. 

This is the same sort of deal. It&#39;s just fried chicken. Seriously. Go somewhere else."

A few nights ago, went here with my hubby cus I was having that feeling again.  As we got there, no one was in the restaurant except for us.  Our order was taken right away, which we thought it was pretty good.

However our food took longer then it should.  First off, I had gotten my cup to get myself a fountain drink.  I found there were no ice.  So we had to have one of the staff, fill our cup up from the drive thru&#39;s fountain machine.  We ordered a 10 piece hot wings, a variety box, and a famous bowl for me.  My hubby had asked for an additional piece of chicken for his variety box.  We must&#39;ve waited about 10 minutes to get our food.  By then, people were coming in too.  And for some reason, the cash register guy in the front taking the order was just having a horribly hard time getting these orders right.  

We decided to walk over to a table and sit down, as we waited for our food.  We finally got our food, and found... we were missing the extra piece of chicken.  So the hubby got back up and probably stood at the counter for another 5-10 minutes before we got that 1 piece of chicken.  

The last thing i wanted to mention too was, as we sat down to eat... the line was getting noticeably long.  There were several customers standing around waiting for their food.  Also the orders were not taken very well... and just appeared like he was having such a hard time getting the orders right.  One customer that came in, must&#39;ve took like 10 minutes just to order.  It was really distracting and loud... that I lost all interest in my food and kept watching what was happening at the counter.

In the end, we finished eatting... and walked out of there.  I dunno if i want to go to this KFC anymore.  I did notice they were working the drive thru alot more faster... so that might be the only way I&#39;ll be coming here again.   Which is not a very good option for me."

 To begin with I tried this place for the first time a few months ago as I had a Groupon... I ordered a few appetizers for the house party with zero expectations and everyone loved the chilli fish and then again on a weekday my wife and I dropped in to explore the dine in experience and we noticed this place has a decent ambience than the most hyped Indian restaurants around, we ordered the hakka noodles and chilli chicken and the food was cooked to perfection and had nice flavor. We also met the owner Tony who was very friendly and we chatted about how passionate he was about running a restaurant and how he ended up starting this place after managing many other restaurants in Chicago.

Then last nite being a lazy Friday night we thought  staying in and ordering some food and that&#39;s when Tony totally blew us away with the food. We ordered the Chicken 65, Chicken Cafreal and goat fry and we were amazed by the flavors poping in our mouth. 

The chicken 65 is not the usual stuff you get at other places, it had an authentic rare taste that I had not tasted in many years since I left India. Chicken Cafreal woww!!! This had a unique distinguished flavor that I had never tasted before, the gravy was green in color and came highly recommend by Tony and he said it was a Portuguese- Goan dish... then the goat fry was very well cooked the pieces just melted in my mouth and my wife who is not usually a fan of goat meat tasted it and loved it.

To sum up my long review...over the years I have easily tried over 30 + places in and around Chicago and I can confidently say this place is the most under rated Indian place in the city that deserves it&#39;s due credit. I rate this place way above all those overhyped  Indian restaurants like Bombay Chopstics, Bawarchi, Paradise , Bamboo garden etc. that just spice/color up and serve food with zero flavor. If you are a foodie that is not just looking for a typical South Indian, North Indian spicy or mild kinda food this is your safe haven... It&#39;s different... It has the best Indo Chinese in the town and then brings that rare Goan cuisine into picture.

All in all our new favorite place for Indian food!  Highly recommended!!! 

Try the Chicken 65,  Hakka Noodles, Chilly fish,  Chicken Cafreal, Goat fry for sure..."

The inside is actually decently nice, especially when contrasted with the exterior. Looked clean, except for the men&#39;s bathroom, which was more on the nasty side.

Other than waiting a quick minute or two to be seated (Only 1 server, 1 bus boy on the floor for a Friday evening) the rest of the service was pretty quick. Attentive, prompt water refills, as well as timely table clearing (before next corse served) 

You get these thin, oily, crispy chips to dip with a sweet brown sauce and spicy green sauce, complimentary before you order. Was pretty flavorful and unique. 

You can also ask for spicy sauce on the side (a must for almost all my meals) which had a good kick and nice flavor. 

Over all: a very tasty, decently priced and exotic spot to eat. Good service to boot. I would definitely come back and recommend! Enjoy life :)"

However, this place is just &#34;okay&#34; in my book.  I am probably spoiled because I&#39;m from Schaumburg, which is home to a variety of excellent Indian restaurants.  But with that disclaimer out of the way:
 
I came here for the weekday lunch buffet, which was a reasonable $10 per person.  One of the first things I noticed was there were no Indian patrons dining here, so take that for what you will.  The second thing I noticed was that my shoes immediately became sticky from walking on their floor.  I&#39;m usually one to overlook that sort of thing, especially if the food is good, but...

There wasn&#39;t as much variety of food as I&#39;m used to from other Indian buffets, and everything skewed bland.  I know it is common for buffets to tone down the spiciness level, but the food was not just not spicy; it also sort of lacked &#39;soul.&#39;  What I ate was serviceable, but there was nothing that made me say &#34;That was so good, I&#39;m going back for some more.&#34;  Even the naan was only pretty good, and when it comes to naan I&#39;m used to speaking in superlatives, so &#34;pretty good&#34; is a downgrade from what I&#39;m used to.

The service was minimal, since it was a buffet, but it was quick at least.  No complaints there.

Overall, I would not be in a rush to come back here, but I might return if a friend wanted to come.  I hate to leave such a lackluster review because the staff seemed nice enough, and everything was basically okay, but I guess that&#39;s what my review boils down to: this place is okay, but there are just other places I would prefer to go."

Very good food and reasonably priced."

It was 6 of us total. 3 people who like Indian food and 3 that have never had it. The 3 people who have never had it, we&#39;re not impressed.

The outside is meh, but the inside is ok. The buffet is in a small corner in the back by the register, which leads directly into the kitchen. A weird spot... we almost didn&#39;t see it.

The service was quick, but the server seemed uninterested in everything. I guess typical buffet.

The food selections are small.. they only had a couple things, 2 appetizers, 2 types of rice, 2 vegetarian dishes, 3 meat, 3 desserts, and some veggies, and sauces. Everything was tasty, but really salty!! So salty we mostly had 1 plate each. I drank about 2 whole cups of water and even more all throughout the day after lunch. Terrible.

My favorites were butter chicken and the veggie samosa even though they were super salty. The tandoori chicken was made from thighs and drumsticks, but they were still somehow dry... I avoided the Chinese dish because who eats Chinese food at an Indian restaurant?? 

The naan was fresh made. It was probably the best thing we ate.

I didn&#39;t wanna mention it when I was there... buuuut.. I found a thick black hair in my butter chicken. I didn&#39;t want to gross out the people I was with (especially since it was their first time eating Indian food) so I didn&#39;t say anything, but I lost my appetite after that.

The price is reasonable, but it made sense because there wasn&#39;t that much to choose from. 

I do think the food could be good, if they didn&#39;t put so much salt (and hair). 

I was put off by that though, so I doubt I&#39;ll be going back and neither will the people I came with. I&#39;m just disappointed that the 3 people I was with had a horrible experience for their first time with Indian food :("

I went there last Tuesday n ordered one mixed platter n goat biriyani. Both were horribly bad. In the platter the goat kabab was too hard n chewy as if its cooked long back n fish was also smelly. The chicken kabob was a bit okay than the rest of the others. Let&#39;s come to biriyani. Its was not biriyani at all rather a masala rice which tastes awfully disgusting. There were no goat meat  only bones. Last but not the least the salad was stale n the raita which comes with biriyani was pungent n over feremented. 
Being an Indian i go to various Indian restaurants but this one is so far the worst restaurant not only in Chicago but whole USA.

The place was empty at 8pm. We ordered and the food came very quickly. Food was still very good. Service was polite and quick.

Ambience was depressing. No one else came in to eat in and we were there till about 9pm. One person came in to pickup. The place needs a good scrubbing.

Prices are expensive considering the depressing atmosphere and ambience but the quality is good and quantity is good as well. I think the owner will do better by opening a carry-out place after reducing prices. Location is not good, find a better one to increase traffic.
For the next time I would get a Groupon and carry out."

You can slack off later, but when we first meet my friend... you better look GOOD. So yeah... this place was obvi an old Wendy&#39;s or IHOP. Externally looks like poop especially considering how the parking lot needs to be done really bad.

The interior is slightly better... but it&#39;s not appetizing to have a restroom door propped open. Hmm. X-/

Had a Groupon or something that got me here... the food seemed overpriced for the venue and considering the numerous Indian options around... might need to be rethought. My $25 got me an entree (Fish Tikka - better the next day) and Naan and potato bread.

Not bad for takeout ... but the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired."

I tried this place because of the yelp reviews and also a friend&#39;s recommendation, and I can confidently say this was the worst Indian food I have ever had.

I can only judge on what I tried which were the following:

We ordered the dinner for two which was $49 and we chose the hot and sour soup with chicken, chicken 65, chicken tikka, chicken makhani, and gulab jamun and kheer. The order does come with rice and garlic naan automatically.

pappadam: free chips before meal were fine, but they were greasy and the oil tasted like it was old. The sauces were good though.

Hot and sour soup with chicken: plus side, it came out steaming hot, which is a great sign. The flavor was just too sour and lacked spicy heat. The chicken that was in the soup was fried, but the chicken looked like it was freezer burnt. Very strange texture on the chicken (rubbery/hard).

Chicken 65: It was probably one of the better things that we actually tried. It was very very greasy, and there was a pool of oil on the plate. The flavor was fine, but definitely not spicy or, in my opinion, traditional. 

Chicken makhani: This is also known as butter chicken. This was the most bland butter chicken ever. There was no spice, no heat, no balance whatsoever. I can make a better butter chicken than that, and I have! I was very disappointed in this dish. It was just like pureed tomatoes with some butter added and some chicken. 

Chicken Tikka: This one was a surprise. We assumed we were getting chicken tikka MASALA, but instead it was just the tandoor grilled chicken. This would have been fine if the chicken was not DRY and overcooked. When it arrived at our table, the chicken was visibly dry on the outside, and clearly they did not baste it with butter or oil. It was dry on the inside and had no flavor or spice, and it needed salt too! Very disappointed.

The rice was just fine, nothing awesome. 
The garlic naan was actually pretty good. I would say that was also probably the best thing we had.

The gulab jamun was just mediocre and so was the kheer. The description of the kheer said it comes with pistachios and almonds, and of course were not present on my dish. It would have been nice to have some texture.

The service was good enough, the server was nice and prompt.

SO basically, based on the food, I will never be back here."

I&#39;ll go with about 4.5 stars as the food quality is quite good, and prepared piping fresh and hot.  Service was attentive but the meal came out on the slow side.  It wasn&#39;t any issue for us as we were in no hurry, but may be a heads-up for others.  The space is a converted KFC, and is calm and quiet with soothing Indian music in the background, and we had a nice peaceful meal.  The business is 3 months old, and does not appear to have caught on yet (we were admittedly there on a Monday evening, so that might not be a fair assessment - but basically it was on quiet side).  As folks discover the food quality and reasonable prices, I think they will get the business they deserve.   We had regular naan ($3), half Tandoori chicken ($10), and tikka masala chicken ($13), all of which were nicely done."

How do I even begin?

Let&#39;s start with the food:
0. Pappadum-for free!!!! We got a nice sized basket of these treats before our dinner came out, pleasant surprise 
1. Chicken tikka masala-gooood! How can you go wrong with this dish and they did this one just right
2. Goat curry-holy cow, you have to try this one. Very flavorful, right amount of spiciness, amazing with the naan (which by the way, buttery goodness, omg ^_^)
3. Aloo Gobi-this is the cauliflower and potato veggie dish, nice complement to our meat heavy dishes. So yummy, non gelatinous like those buffet ones tend to be)
4. Tandoori appetizer platter-we didn&#39;t want to order just the tandoori chicken so we got the whole appetizer platter. Wish the chicken tandoori was a little burnier but that&#39;s just a personal preference
5. Kheer-the dessert, rice pudding, my favorite. They totally did it justice here, it&#39;s so much better than all the buffet kinds, the toppings were an added bonus!!!
6. Naan-I already raved about this up above but I&#39;ll do it again here; they are amazing. Probably the best one yet!

In all honesty, we probably ordered dinner for six people, but it was totally worth it because we have two more meals we can eat tomorrow, and how can I say no to that!!!

The waiter guy was really nice and attentive, he noticed I had dropped my knife from the other side of the restaurant and rushed to get me a new set!

Another Yelper had mentioned not to be put off by the exterior of the restaurant, and I totally agree with that sentiment-definitely do not judge this particular book by its cover. The food is delish, I had the pleasure of visiting the bathroom, which is nice, clean and smells fresh, so definitely give this place a try, especially if you have a craving for Indian food.

I order veggie samosas, and bhel puri, and I had never tried the latter before. I was happy with both. Samosas had a crisp, spicy-ish pastry and a fluffy potato filling.

They also gave use a complimentary basket of thin, crisp chips with two sauces. One was a spicy green one and the other was copper-brown and savory. I liked that one a lot! 
We were waited on well. The waiter was diligent about refilling my water, though certainly not overbearing. I also enjoyed the cleanliness of it all, including the bathroom. It feels classy.

I ordered the chana masala, my mom ordered the vegetable korma, my dad, the fish masala, and my brother, the lamb masala.  Both my dad and brother loved their dishes, and both my mom and I really enjoyed ours, but thought the vegetables/beans could have been a little more cooked (we know that is a preference though, some people may prefer slightly harder veggies and beans).

Only complaint was I could have used a little more rice for the size of my order. Other than that very small complaint, nothing but a positive experience for me. I WILL be ordering from Spice Grill again soon, just with an extra side of rice ;)"

Location is close to Golf Road but not directly on Golf Road so definitely a hidden jewel in the area for sure. Very close to Schaumburg so I would definitely add this to the list of possible options when looking for Indian cuisine.  Overall 5 star experience.

The inside is comfortably decorated with new fixtures and furniture.  There were about 8 main indian dishes to choose from.  I sampled about 6 of them.  They were all very good.  The samosas are average but the flavor from the other choices was excellent.  In addition, they bring fresh and hot naan right to your table.

It had the right spices and cooked to perfection. The fish was fresh and was of right size (Be careful for bones as its a whole fish marinated and fried). 
I had ordered Tandoor Platter (was pretty decent) and some Kerala shrimp curry(really tasted authentic). The spice level were as ordered for. Here Spicy means Spicy!!!!
Masala Kulcha was fresh and hot till even I reached home (mine being a pickup order). Was really soft when I had it.

Over all i think if you&#39;re craving Thai this place will feed your craving.  I don&#39;t agree with their prices according to their service or taste.

We didn&#39;t receive any extra sauces or anything with our order. We also got an order of egg rolls, which were about the size of a roll of dimes (possibly smaller).

Tom Yum Goong(Shrimp) : I&#39;m a big fan of the tom yum and this one doesn&#39;t disappoint. I got the hot pot and as expected it comes out flaming in a circular pot. (See picture) Compared to other Thai places this one is only slightly less sweet which I prefer. Pretty standard tasty tom yum soup with a bunch of shrimp. (9.99)

Pork Pad Thai: Having eaten this at a bunch of places around here I realized there&#39;s actually two variations to this dish. There is one with the thin vermicelli-ish rice noodles and there is the one here with the thin and flat linguini-ish rice noodles.(See Picture) Personally I prefer this style. The pork was cooked well and the sauce was spot on. This is my new go to spot for Pad Thai. (like 8.00)

Thai Iced Tea: sweet and creamy spiced tea. Would be perfect if it weren&#39;t 15 degrees outside today... (2.00)

Over all I would say this is a rock solid neighborhood Thai place. If you&#39;re in the mood for a hot bowl of tom yum or a tangy plate of pad Thai, DEFINITELY  give this place a go."

I review 4 stars it&#39;s because bad atmosphere. Their yam woon sen is the best. They made it right. Curry isn&#39;t that too sweet as other Thai restaurants. And great price.

We didn&#39;t know where to go and looked up a couple Thai and Indian restaurants in the area. Their $5.99 lunch special sealed the deal. Two people in our group also never had Thai food before so it was going to be a good experience.

Thai Thanee is a lovely little restaurant tucked away near the end of a strip mall that suddenly appears after driving through tons of residential areas. At noon on a Wednesday, there was no one there except one staff member (I assume there were more people in the back, but we never saw them). I was kind of surprised that we were the only people dining here. Oh well, more space for us!

We all ordered something different from the lunch special menu: an entree, a soup, two mini egg rolls, and a side of white rice. The soup (I forget what it was) was spicy, but good. The egg rolls were great!! I&#39;ve never had egg rolls that I actually liked before (I tend to avoid them) and I was scarfing these down. Sweet. My lunch was the Pad Woon Sen with Tofu -- it was delicious and just the right amount! I was a happy luncher. I think my co-workers were too (the two that never had Thai before enjoyed their dishes). I felt satisfied when I left -- good price, good food, good company.

Although I had a good experience, this is one of those places that makes you feel like you have to come back at another time to try a different dish in order to really know what its like here. So, I&#39;ll come back if I find myself near here again!"

I picked Thai Thanee because it was close and had a super cheap lunch special... and killer reviews on Yelp.  Other than our group of seven, there was one other table with 2 people.  So it was pretty dead from noon to one.

We were a bit worried that it might take a while to get our food, but there was super speedy here and accommodating.  They gave us to go glasses so we could bring our drinks back with us!

My lunch came with a Tom Yum soup that I devoured and two mini egg rolls.  As Laura N.. mentioned... these egg rolls are good... I usually give mine away, but I ate every scrap of these.  I ordered a spicy dish that was stir fry beef peppers, jalapeno and onion.  It was really good, but you have to like spicy... again I think I may have liked the plate clean.

The atmosphere left a bit to be desired... it kind of creeped me out that there was no music... which I also noticed other people mentioned in their reviews.  But, the food and service were great!"

I&#39;m a huge fan of the following dishes served there: spring rolls, chicken sa-te, chicken praram, chicken pad Thai, pineapple fried rice, beef chow mein, vegetable lard nah, and tofu (or chicken) sweet and sour.

I have taken a particular liking to their Red Curry Chicken dish which I have had twice this week alone.  Yep, I may have issues... The first couple times I had it, it didn&#39;t have that spicy kick that I typically enjoy.  Now we are on the same page and I tell them I want it extra, extra spicy.  Absolutely great flavor!  There is some inconsistency with the amount of chicken / vegetables from time to time, but overall, I&#39;ve been happy.

I have never seen more than 3 tables at any given time--even on a Saturday night @ 7:30 when I picked up my take out.  Not sure if that is a testament to the other reviews complaining of slow service, but my take out has always been ready for pick up with in 10-15 minutes.  Impressive.  The portions are good size and I always can get two meals out of anything I&#39;ve had.  Not too shabby for less than $10 on average.  Definitely check it out!

UPDATE:  Went there for a quick bite to eat Friday night on my way home and decided to dine in.  Again, only a handful of tables, but the server was prompt and attentive and the service was pretty fast.  Interestingly, I noticed that when dining in, my portion of red curry (still can&#39;t get enough of this!) is nearly twice the size for the same price.  More leftovers for me.  I was quite impressed with the service so for that I have upgraded my rating to 4 stars."

I stumbled in here during a road trip from Cleveland to Minneapolis - a nearby Hyatt Place was my stopping point for the evening, and nothing says road trip relaxation like Thai food, pajamas, and crappy reruns of &#34;Big Bang Theory.&#34;

I ordered online, and went to pick my food up. It was already ready, and I was there five minutes early. The food was hot - temperature wise - and appropriately spiced. The decor wasn&#39;t the most exciting, but as I was doing carry out, decor was of no consequence to me.

I was very pleased with the price, the good food, and the portion size, which was just perfect for one person. The woman at the front was extremely polite, and made great small talk. Should I stay nearby again, I&#39;ll not hesitate to order from Thai Thanee."

Thai food is Thai food is Thai food, I&#39;m a pretty staunch supporter of this viewpoint. It&#39;s hard to find terrible Thai, just as tough as it is to find excellent Thai. And Thai Thanee does nothing to battle my opinion. It&#39;s in a strip mall. Out of the way. Next to some Mexican joint. Near a 7-11. If none of these things excite you don&#39;t worry, the food won&#39;t either.

I&#39;ve had a handful of dishes from Thai Thanee. Their Chicken satay, spring rolls, Pad Thai, Pad Se Ewe, Pad Woonsen and Lard Nar are all about as standard as they come. Nothing to make me jump out of my seat, nor off a bridge. Just kinda sit there and chew noisily. The one bright spot I&#39;ve found on their menu is the Kaeng Panaeng, which is a great yellow curry with basil, peas, carrots, peppers and your choice of meat, chicken in my case. Over some rice it has a nice amount of spice but isnt overwhelming and the flavor really comes through. Props where props are due. 

It&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s just not all that good, either."

The fried shrimp dinner with fries was also tasty. Hubs had the pasta and said it was great. Crab cakes were good, but I wouldn&#39;t order them again....I kept biting into hard bits of something; may have been shell.

There&#39;s something fishy goin&#39; on so you best stop what you&#39;re doing and get on over here and to Don&#39;s Dock!  Coming here is a sure-fire way to get your fill of lobster, shrimp and all those other creepy crawly creatures from the bottom of the ocean.  If I didn&#39;t love seafood so much I might be sad that the little lobsters and shrimp were taken from their families, but the truth is I do love lobster and shrimp - very, very, very much - so I&#39;m much happier that they&#39;ve made their way to my stomach.  I only wish I had more lobsta to enjoy!  

I can&#39;t knock Don&#39;s Dock for that because unlike some restaurants, this local business gives its customers what they want - a lobster roll that is more lobster than roll.  (Have I mentioned that I looove lobster?)  In fact, Don&#39;s Dock loads the goods in anything that they&#39;re serving that way you&#39;re getting exactly what you pay for.  There is no use in complaining about how expensive it is because good, fresh seafood is expensive anywhere, and you might as well pay for such high quality seafood at a local business that isn&#39;t too stingy to pack it&#39;s rolls and tacos with seafood galore.  The prices are actually comparable to many of the other restaurants serving up the same type of food, but again you get a better deal here.  For the lobster roll its about $15 and for the seafood taco combination its about $18 - you can guesstimate the rest.

Now that the logistics are out of the way, can we just take a break to sing a little song by the B-52&#39;s, please?  

&#34;Somebody went under a dock,
And there they saw a rock,
It wasn&#39;t a rock,
It was a rock lobster,
Rock lobsterrrrrrrrr!&#34;

Okay, that&#39;s out of my system now...but I do have to say one more thing about the lobster - it rocked.  In all seriousness, the lobster was amazing here at Don&#39;s Dock - both in the lobster roll and in the lobster taco.  Yes, I had both and they were phenomenal.  The actual roll that makes up the lobster roll is freaking delicious, and in total this is one of the best lobster rolls I&#39;ve had.  But the lobster taco - that&#39;s a whole other thing.  They put some different seasoning on the lobster in the taco and the flavor exploded in my mouth!  I actually got the shrimp taco as a part of the dinner and that was also amazing.  This taco combo came with chips and sweet salsa, coleslaw and a type of jambalaya rice (minus the shrimp).  Now, someone else in our party got the popcorn shrimp with fries, and as simple as this may sound it was also super yummy!  Weirdly enough, those fries are some of the best fries around.  And the shrimp is awesome - the breading on it is super light and it doesn&#39;t subtract from the flavor.  We also got the hush puppies free of charge (courtesy of the Yelp check-in offer); they were dry and not that great but they were free.  Free is always good.

Now if you&#39;re not planning on staying, then you can surely come in here and pick up some seafood to go.  They have plenty of options to choose from and they are fresh everyday - you might as well get your seafood from here as opposed to a grocery store (unless, of course, you&#39;re looking to pay a little less).  

I also love the décor in the restaurant.  It&#39;s filled with decorations reminiscent of New Orleans; its fun sitting in the restaurant and looking at everything on their walls while enjoying your lobster!  If you do want to sit here be mindful of the fact that seating is limited since it is a small restaurant, but usually all the seats are not taken up.  

Oh, and keep a look-out for their specials that they do each month!"

The sides which was rice, broccoli, and hush puppies were all cold. Normally, I  am not to hard to please, but  I don&#39;t think we will go back. This place is expensive for what you get."

Yup it&#39;s still greasy and not fresh.  I was looking for that other place down the st.  ( I won&#39;t mention it).   My food  is trying to be fresh.  The fish was just old and terrible.  So I took a few bites and when I came home my dogs even turned  there nose to it.  And they can be garbage disposer some times !! In this day and age. Fish can be flown in.  For heavens sake we are so close to ORD.   There  is no excuse to serve such bad fish.

Great service - the young lady who took care of us and other customers was just a pleasure! We both had the #10 Shrimp Fest Platter. Great shrimp tacos, fried shrimp (light on batter, big on shrimp), bourbon shrimp over rice (damn good!), stuffed shrimp, and...wait for it, some great fries. I mean, yummy really yummy. Bought some scallops from their small-but-packs-one-HELL-of-a-punch market, as well as some freshly made potato salad. Want to get back here soon!"

But I happened to be in the area around 2:30PM and I hadn&#39;t had any lunch. I figured it would be a perfect time to venture in. All in all, it was though the place was still about 75% sat (occupied).

I was really in the mood for fried shrimp. Images of outstanding fried shrimp that my parents used to pick up at a place in Oak Park on North Avenue called &#34;The Broastery&#34; were flashing through my mind. Deliciously large two hearty bite shrimp they offered; with just the right amount of breading and a fantastic cocktail sauce. This is what I was seeking at Don&#39;s.

So to the counter I go to place my order - it was the jumbo shrimp that caught my eye on the menu. So I asked about those, but the staffperson directed me to the seemingly smaller &#34;large&#34; shrimp option. His point was that the jumbo had the tails on and the large didn&#39;t (which as shrimp are weighed and sized shouldn&#39;t make a difference) and the large came with hush puppies and was a heartier dish. So I went with the recommendation. I also inquired about crabcakes as there were a couple of options - I was directed toward a single real crabmeat choice with a remoulade sauce on the side. Finally, a seafood pasta salad in the case looked pretty good as a take home option, so I ordered that as a to-go item. 

Well, the crabcake recommendation was a good one - enjoyed that immensely. But the shrimp fell short. In my mind they weren&#39;t all that big, but what killed it for me was that they seemed like about 60% breading and 40% shrimp. The presence of all that breading overpowered any flavor that the shrimp might have had. Bummer. As for the seafood pasta salad - it was ok. 

So peer pressure of other Yelpers notwithstanding, I must give Don&#39;s three stars. They do have a huge variety there and at some point, I&#39;ll try and get back to check them out again. But as for shrimp, I&#39;ll be looking elsewhere."

Everything I have ever ordered has been great, so good that I usually come back to get certain items on their specials menu twice in the same week.  Employees are friendly and service is prompt.

I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy (+ chips + pop) and my husband ordered the Fish chips (+ fries + slaw). I thought my sandwich tasted fresh and delicious with the tartar &amp; cocktail sauce.

It&#39;s very good but I do think it&#39;s pricey for the portion they serve you! Also the service is excellent! Alexis took our order and she smiled the entire time and every time we approached her afterwards. My mouth would hurt after smiling that much. 

You order at the register and then they call your number and you get your food from
the counter (no table service, so no tips!). I&#39;d suggest eating their so your food is still warm. They have many tables inside even if the dining area is small. Dining area isn&#39;t anything special, they have a lot of seafood related decoration on the walls. 

They must really really like their decoration. Their were a bunch of condiment bottles put out as decoration and the owner came out to make sure they are aligned perfectly and that the label was facing forward (See the pictures). I thought I&#39;d take lots of pictures of the decoration since they work so hard to make sure it&#39;s perfect.

I would return to get the fried shrimp! Wish it was cheaper though."

I have ordered the large fried shrimp, the fish chips, the fried clams and the hush-puppies (though the hush-puppies are not the best). All the fried fare&#39;s are comparable to my other favorite fried fish place in Chicago, both in cost and in tastyness.
Don&#39;s Dock is very good and I will find myself frequenting here more often. The staff is very nice, and although the two times I was here was before 10:00AM, I never waited for more than a few minutes for my food, which I&#39;m guessing will not be the case if I would arrive at a more conventional lunch and dinner time.

When we arrived we were initially overwhelmed with the choices.  Alexis was super sweet and friendly, and explained the whole menu AND specials to us. She gave us suggestions and let us know what the most popular items were. 

He ordered the Fish Tacos and I had the Fish and Chips. Both were reaaaally delish! I enjoyed the biscuit-type bun and the tartar sauce was a great compliment to the fish. I was really pleased with fresh fruit on the side. His salsa (both on the tacos and on the side) was a bit too sweet for my particular taste. I love that the tortillas were grilled.

I also like that this is not &#34;fast&#34; food by any means - we waited about 10 minutes for our food, it came out piping hot, and you could tell it was made with care. Not only that, but it was both fresh AND reasonably priced.

The grilled calamari was not nearly as good, just ok, same for the gumbo, too much rice and green peppers for my taste. Back to the good stuff, the lobster mac &amp; cheese was excellent. We brought a bottle of wine and they gladly provided us with an opener and wine glasses.

We ordered in one night from here and I only have two qualms: its a tiny bit expensive and the hush puppies were jalapeno. I would not have been upset by the hush puppies but they did not have any description that they were flavored so I was expecting more of the traditional hush puppies.

We got some fish and chips [which were good but the &#39;fish&#39; was small chunks rather than larger pieces] and then clam chowder. I really enjoyed the clam chowder as it was full of flavor and a little looser than traditional new england style chowders [which i guess doesn&#39;t make it new england style since the spoon should be standing up in the soup].

We will probably be returning as the items we got were good; just not as consistently as the pricing is a little high."

When we arrived, it is a small place about 8 to 10 tables of four on one side and on the other side is a display of fresh seafood sold by the pound and premade food by the pound and also you can order different meals over the counter.
 Of course their speciality is seafood.
They sell fresh seafood from oysters to smoke salmon. But we were here for their mardi Gras dinner specials. They had a wide variety of choices.  The prices are not bad. 
It&#39;s a tiny place more of a divey establishment. There were a lot of take out orders too. They serve your food in plastic containers and plastic utensils so nothing fancy here.
You pick a number from the ticket taker and place your order and they will call your number when your meal is ready.
I have to say the folks here were very friendly even when they were really busy tonight.
I like the fact that they were wearing Mardi Gras colors and passing out free beads on Fat Tuesday. The decor was also Mardi Gras theme of New Orleans. Even the music that was playing in the background got you in the mood. 
We ordered the shrimp Po boy sandwich, it came with homemade chips and coleslaw. The bread was soft and the lettuce and tomato were fresh. The fried shrimp were baby shrimp so they kept on coming out of the sandwich every time hubby took a bite. We prefer bigger size shrimp for the sandwich. But it was fine, because they had enough baby fried shrimp in the sandwich. 
The homemade chips were crispy and the slaw was okay too, it had a sweet taste to it like KFC slaw taste.
I had the sausage and baby shrimp jambalaya in a bowl which was flavorful. I would get this again. I also ordered a quarter pound of their hush puppies which had a Cajun seasoning kick to it which was pretty good too.
I got a free cornbread muffin when I checked in from yelp. I&#39;m glad it was free because it was cold and dry boo. I would not have paid for it.

Seriously. He&#39;s been talking about this place as long as I&#39;ve known him. And so once I became a Yelper, I bookmarked Don&#39;s Dock. Now, I have suggested about two million times that we hit the Dock to which I have been greeted with a: It&#39;s too far...we&#39;ll go another time.

Recently, fate stepped in. We were fifteen minutes away and hungry. Woo hoo!  

I entered this very clean, yet very small establishment and I was immediately overwhelmed. (Side note:  I was visually impaired this day. Recently dilated eyes at the doctor&#39;s office. I knew I was in the right place by the delectable smells alone!) Making a decision was next to impossible. The hubby easily chose the fried shrimp with fries and potato salad. I took longer to decide and landed on the Maryland crab cakes with shrimp pasta salad instead of fries. 

We waited patiently at a table right in the middle of the restaurant. It&#39;s counter service which was perfect.  Soda in a can. Enough options to make this caffeine-free girl happy. 

When the food arrived, we were immediately tasting everything on each other&#39;s plates. My favorites from top to bottom:

Shrimp pasta salad
Fried shrimp
Cole slaw
Maryland crab cake
Potato salad (with dill!)
Fries
Shrimp sauce 

I loved the pasta salad!!!  I&#39;m so glad that I tried it. The shrimp were great without any sauce. The husband didn&#39;t love the potato salad but that&#39;s because it was different. I like different. ;-) 

Overall, I wish they were closer to home. They have waaaay too many options, so I will absolutely need to visit again soon. The prices were fair. It&#39;s not a cheap visit, but certainly didn&#39;t break the bank. Thanks Don&#39;s Dock!"

Pure mush... they use very small shells and it&#39;s just not good. The portion is very good and the amount of lobster is very good but the completed meal for both dinners....lobster gelatin. On a better note the crab stuffed salmon is amazing and can be cooked at home to impress any guest!!

Wow! What a disappointment!  We were excited to try dons. I had jerk chicken and grilled shrimp plate. Bland bland bland...and did I mention bland? My fiance had bourbon shrimp.

Being Asian decent, we eat A LOT of seafood. I moved to Arlington Heights about a year ago and was super excited to discover this place. My family and I ate there a few nights ago. The staff were very nice and efficient. I was very excited to see that they have Blue Point raw oysters. I&#39;m obsessed with raw oysters.  I was sooooooooooooo disappointed because it was really fishy smelling and tasted just as fishy. Any raw oyster fan will tell you that a good quality raw oyster is NOT supposed to smell. At all. Bad smelling ones will smell fishy. A seafood place like this SHOULD NOT have bad quality oysters. Now I get that maybe one bad oyster will slip past their expert sniff test but I order half a dozen and EVERY SINGLE ONE was bad. That&#39;s too bad because I had really high hopes for this places. 

My second order was crab tacos (it was crab season there) and it was ok. there were more fillings than crab meat itself. Once again, disappointed. 

But I have to say, I&#39;m more overall concerned and disappointed with the raw oysters than anything. A busy restaurant that&#39;s as packed as this place and specializes in seafood SHOULD NOT be serving bad oysters. 

It&#39;s a shame. I really, REALLY was excited about this place."

They are having their 63rd anniversary on Labor Day, and it&#39;s a 50% special that day, so a particularly good time to try &#39;em.  It&#39;s a generally casual t-shirt type crowd that comes here (though one customer that came through did have a tie on), and we fit right in on this day.  We enjoyed their lobster roll (a top seller at $13.95), a half pound of fried smelt, and a quarter pound of fried calamari.  You can order whatever you want by weight which is nice for sampling if you like.  It&#39;s also BYOB.  There&#39;s lotsa selections on the menu board, and it all looks good.  I enjoyed the smelt a little more than the calamari, as the calamari was a little chewy.  Lobster roll was delightful.

The only kind of seafood I like is breaded and deep fried, or it comes in a can. If you&#39;re like me, this review is for.

I was introduced to Don&#39;s by a coworker. I told him I&#39;m not a fish guy so he recommended getting the &#34;fish chips.&#34; Fish chips are whitefish chunks that are breaded and deep fried. You get them in a brown paper bag and you order them by the 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or 1 pound bag. I ordered them and really liked them. Dons has a plethora of hot sauces for you to try too. 

On another occasion I ordered the gumbo and it was excellent. The hush puppies are tasty and so are the fried shrimp. There are a TON of fried fish choices on the menu, and they also sell fresh fish. 

The place is small, but it is very clean. The staff was courteous and helpful. Prices are very reasonable.

I highly recommend this place to fish first timers or people just plain sick and tired of Long John Silvers. Good tasting fried fish, good quality, a large selection, and decent prices."

All the fish is very fresh, arguably some of the freshest tasting around the burbs for sure and maybe even the city.

Two orders of walleye and one of the crab cakes.  Have to say the order of crab cakes beat the walleye - nice sized cakes, thick, moist, delicious.  Walleye was also good - fresh, juicy.  Fries were good.  Coleslaw wasn&#39;t your norm, but good nonetheless.

It is bad enough to use instant rice in the first place, to have undercooked instant rice is a kick in the teeth. I had the #7 Mardi Gras platter today...it blew pretty hard.

Cajun catfish, fried beyond recognition and salty. This was the best thing on the platter.

Hush puppies, have you ever let a kindergarten class cook you lunch? It would taste like these hush puppies, hard on the outside, irregularly small shaped, raw dough on the inside.

Crawfish Ettoufee... I imagine that this recipe came out of some jail or institutional cookbook. I&#39;d poke more fun here, but this isn&#39;t funny.

The meal was very good with the exception of the hush puppies.  I wish that Don&#39;s would look at these reviews and figure out a better recipe for his hush puppies - they were heavy, greasy and not much flavor at all.

On a good note, when you order your second helping of fish, you have the option of getting a repeat on everything (fries &amp; coleslaw &amp; hush puppies :-().  Very generous servings.  

We will be back!"

Since it was lent, on Friday&#39;s I experimented with new places.  I regret picking Don&#39;s as one of my new finds.  When I arrived, the parking lot was packed, and the door wasnt closing, there were so many people inside.  I got excited thinking this was a good sign.  Surely so many people can&#39;t keep coming if it was bad?  Maybe these people have been coming here for so long, they dont remember how GOOD seafood is supposed to taste.

Let me break it down for you in all honesty, this place is dirty, its old, the average age of a person in here is 55+.  The place has a few deep fryers and that&#39;s about it.  They have a messy style of ordering, then you wait to have your number called like in a deli.  No one can hear them yelling, cause everyone is so loud in there.  There are about 5 or so tables you can eat at.  I had the crab cake dinner, the 2 crab cakes tasted like they were made 3 days ago, ewwww.  They were mushy and all I could taste was bread crumbs and oil.  Lots of disgusting oil.  The &#34;dinner&#34; also had coleslaw which was the equivalent of about 1.5 tablespoons, and mediocre fries that tasted like fish.  I also ordered a half pound of the calamari.  It was breaded and seemed that it was breaded as one big clump, and thrown into the fryer.  Or it was stuck after being taken out of the freezer and no one cared.  

If they dont care, neither do I, I will never ever come back to this place.  I will wait to see it on the news one day being shut down by the Des Plaines food dept or someone dieing of food poisoning.

Seriously people, go have a Wendy&#39;s cod sandwich and dont come here!"

I guess I am in a minority here. I hated it.

I ordered a shrimp po&#39;boy and some hush puppies.

The hushpuppies were heavy, dense, greasy (oil thru most of the puppy) while over done on the outside. Really bad.

The shrimp po&#39;boy. Well, I will say they gave a fair number of shrimp. However, the remoulade was non-existant on most of the sandwich and from what I was able to taste was just a bad mayo with cayenne (sorta, kinda). There was too much bread and the token tomato was soggy, the lettuce wilted. I ate some of the shrimp and called it a day.

Really was excited about this place since it had such good reviews. 

Good points: It does not smell fishy inside the restaurant. It&#39;s clean and cute."

After some good ole web searching for a place to eat some Catholic friendly food, my boyz and I settled on Don&#39;s Dock, a place we had seen been never been.

We pull into the parking lot and it is PACKED.  This must be a good sign right?  Walking in, there is only standing room as we attempt to make our way to the counter and order up.  Between the three of us, we ordered up a lot of different things, but here&#39;s what I tried:

Salmon Burger, Grilled:  $4 for a tasty homemade salmon burger on a chewy roll with chips.  Great for the price and filling!

Fried Catfish:  This took us the longest for the order to come through, however it was tender, boneless, and crisp.  Very nice!  Came with tasty french fries for $6.  Good choice.

Crab Bisque:  It was definitely a good homemade soup, but for $4 for a half pint, it was definitely slightly over priced IMHO.  If you&#39;re a fan of crab bisque, try it and help provide a better review, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be getting this one again.

New England Clam Chowder:  While a little bit watery, flavor and texture was good.  This is my soup of choice when I get back here.

The main thing to note is that Don&#39;s consistently has sales ALL THE TIME.  If you can make it there, check out their monthly/daily specials to know what to take advantage of.  Great fish for a good price!  Sashimi fans beware, there is nothing here for you unfortunately...

Verdict:  I&#39;ll definitely be making a trip back, especially to check them out on their special days.  They have all you can eat specials pretty regularly on Monday/Tuesday nights which I&#39;d like to give a whirl.  Check it out seafood fans... worthwhile!

To be noted:  There really isn&#39;t much of a dine-in area, so don&#39;t come expecting to bring a whole family!  Very limited space, but still great take home food!"

Very disappointed in value, ordered $15 shrimp sampler to share (after asking if qty was enough for two), server said it was ...WRONG!  It wouldn&#39;t have been enough for 1!  I don&#39;t think there were more than 15 sticks of french fries, the shrimp were small living up to the name &#34;shrimp&#34; , there was only one &#34;shell on shrimp&#34; and 2 each of the others.  At best, on the outside this was a $10 meal.  At establishments of this nature you usually are served more than you can eat, not here!  The taste was OK, not offensive or anything but far from having any distinctiveness, just fried food.  The curb appeal of this place is diner fare and it misses the mark on value by a long, long way."

-coconut shrimp with the plum sauce 
- crab pasta salad 
-Grilled Salmon

It definitely is  madhouse on Fridays during Lent and is busy in general. The place really seems to be a favorite amongst the older generation. The average age in there must be early sixties.
I personally think the food is ok, but slightly overpriced. A seafood dinner which includes shrimp, perch and fish chips is $8.40 pre tax. That means you&#39;re paying almost $9.50 for a limited amount of fried fish with a side of fries and slaw. Im my opinion their portions could be slightly larger.
If you phone in your order they can usually have at ready in 10 mins or less for their fried options. The staff is very friendly and a nice mix of younger kids to adults. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could."

The better part about this place is that if you don&#39;t want fried food you can go ahead and buy it fresh. They also offer a great crab bisque as well as some good seafood gumbo.

Came here &amp; got a large pizza this past Sunday to take to a friend&#39;s house for the football games. Took them the average amount of time, 20-30 minutes for a large pizza. The staff, including the owner, was pretty friendly. They even included plates &amp; napkins.

Let&#39;s move on to the most important part, TASTE! Off jump, they had a nice amount of cheese to add a nice gooeyness (don&#39;t think that&#39;s a word lol). The crust was not uncomfortably thin like New York pizza. Sauce, while not the best I&#39;ve had, got the job done. Overall, good spot for a quick local pizza."

We ordered pizza and cheese fries. The pizza was pretty good, but the fries were just OK. It was clear they were frozen and fried. One of my friends ordered a sandwich and she said it was fine. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing exceptional either.

Today was the second time I&#39;ve had a bad experience with one of their delivery drivers.  The first bad one was last year and the guy was just late and rude.

Nope. If the food was something special I&#39;d have no problem, but I&#39;m  not supporting a mediocre restaurant that also hires people like that. 

UPDATE!   The owner of IPK messaged me apologizing for the poor employee behavior.

Nothing too exciting to report, but hopefully this is still helpful. Here goes...

A couple weeks ago my parents and I went over to my sister&#39;s place for games, drinks and to hang out. For dinner we planned to order in. My sister suggested IPK. She said her and her boyfriend order food from there all the time and it&#39;s really good. However, she said their pizza wasn&#39;t her favorite but she has loved everything else. 

So why, did I decide to order pizza? Who knows. I blame my decision on the bottle of wine I drank prior.

I claimed not to be super hungry so my mom and I split a 12 inch pizza. We went with the Bianca which consisted of fresh ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan on thin crust topped with your choice of broccoli or spinach (we had spinach). Then all of that is drizzled with extra virgin olive oil (no red sauce).

It was definitely tasty. Not my absolute favorite pizza, but a good combo for sure. My main complaint was that their was too much spinach. It was literally a thick layer of chunky spinach laying under all that delicious cheese. Too much for me.

The delivery was timely and everything came hot. My dad got an Italian beef sandwich which looked really yummy, and so did the other burgers/sandwiches that were ordered. I thought prices were reasonable as well.

I&#39;ll for sure be enjoying their food again since it&#39;s a staple spot for my sis. Can&#39;t wait to dive into their menu outside of pizza, because they offer a lot of other options!"

I know the owner of Italian Pizza Kitchen values input, as both the +1 and I were contacted following our last reviews. He included his number and offered an &#34;improved experience,&#34; which was thoughtful. I hadn&#39;t accepted because, though the sentiment is nice, I just feel uncomfortable about it. Anyhoo, we decided the extensive menu and coupon were enough incentive to give them another shot.

We ordered Take Out: a Shrimp + Spinach Linguine and an 18&#34; thin crust with spinach + half anchovies. I was quoted 25-30 minutes (they&#39;re 10 minutes away).

I arrived on time (7:45) and my order was taken out of the warmer. When I got home and my +1 saw the pizza:

&#34;How does it go again? &#39; Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me?&#39; &#34; 

The cheese was half hardened and the pasta lukewarm, so we had to reheat it all. Makes me wonder how long it sat.

The linguine was cooked well and the sauce was tasty, but the shrimp were SUPER salty (frozen/brine). They included a sandwich roll which felt pillowy and soft in the cellophane. Oh, and a little packet of parmesan cheese: nice!

As for the pizza: it had LOTS of cheese. Heavy, oily cheese (no Lowfat Moz here!) and a too-hard and really bland crust. IMO the only flavorful part was the sauce, which is a shame. Definitely sad I ordered such a large pie because the bf wants nothing to do with it.

Maybe it&#39;s about timing, or maybe it&#39;s just me, but I need a better pizza. The search resumes!"

Overall the pizzas are pretty good, quality wise. If you want to see a comically large pizza, order a stadium sized one. It&#39;s pretty much a full sheet pan of pizza. Silverware looks toy like next to that behemoth. Note for everyone, they go pretty heavy on cheese (like a solid half centimeter or more) so if you love cheese, leave the order as default, if you are trying to cut back on calories, go light on cheese.... and stop ordering pizza.

I&#39;ve seen some of the Yelp complaints and I cannot speak for customer service or how warm the food is (as we usually do carry-out) but I can say that the food is delicious and we will continue to order from IPK!"

Well, if so, you&#39;re in luck with Italian Pizza Kitchen. Not only are these quick, Italian eats tasty and fresh, the portions are B.I.G. 

The fam and I rolled in on a sleepy Saturday afternoon, looking to fill our bellies and not upset anyone in a more upscale restaurant by bringing a 14 month old. We had the whole place to ourselves, which worked out well since they only have a handful of tables and one highchair. Score! The folks behind the counter were super sweet and helpful, welcoming the three of us as we made our way through their plentiful offerings. 

I sampled quite a bit but here are a few standouts...

Cheesy garlic bread: A thick coating of flavorful, garlicky cheese atop toasty bread. Yum fest all around. 

Caprese sandwich with pesto: Very fresh bread stuffed with an ample portion of thick mozzarella medallions, bright tomato, a drizzle of balsamic and a delicious spread of pesto. The sammie was large and in charge, ensuring that I had a sizeable lunch the next day. 

Gnocchi with sauteed spinach: I&#39;m not kidding when I say the portions are huge. My daughter ate some, I ate some, my husband ate some, my daughter ate some the next day for lunch and we *still* have some left. The gnocchi were none too soft, covered in a zesty marinara and a decent serving of sauteed spinach scattered about. 

Pro-tip: I overheard that they deliver within five miles. Definitely want to give that a go in the future!"

I&#39;ve tried branching out a lot at this place and keep getting disappointed. Today I tried their Gnocchi Florentine. I wasn&#39;t expecting miracles because it&#39;s a pizza place but it was just... disappointing. Despite the abundance of spinach, ricotta and tomatoes... it was just really bland. Not surprisingly, the gnocchi is probably store bought so it was just ok.  

The thing that made me super frustrated was the quality of their containers. I only work about 3 minutes away. When I got to my office, the paper bag holding my gnocchi was leaking. I didn&#39;t even have to open the paper bag because the top literally peeled off because it soaked through so much. The top of the pasta container was the flimsiest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. It looked like I could peel off the foil on the paper top and it was soaked too. Everything they gave me (napkins, utensils, parmesan cheese packages) were soaked too.

Luckily I had an extra tupperware in my car otherwise I would have had to throw away the second half of my gnocchi.

*EDIT* The owner contacted me and said that he&#39;s looking into new containers!"

Today I stopped by and ordered their Linguini with chicken and broccoli for lunch. I thought the price tag of $13.50 was pretty high. I assumed the pasta dish was either really gourmet or descent but a ton of food. Unfortunately it wasn&#39;t even descent. It was so nuclear hot that it was burning my tongue - clearly microwaved. Also half of the broccoli was rotten. It was completely black and mushy. Overall very disappointed. I&#39;ll continue to order pizza but will not order anything else off the menu moving forward. I don&#39;t see a point in offering dishes like this. They should either take it off the menu or make it worth $13.50 which means making it when its ordered and with fresh high quality ingredients."

It was reminiscent because I ate them all the time growing up in high school. They call it stuffed garlic sticks here. They add a bit of parmesan &amp; parsley on top &amp; cook it to a perfect golden brown stuffed with mozzarella cheese, served with marinara dipping sauce on the side.

I ordered two 16&#34; thin crust pizzas; one with mushroom &amp; pepperoni, the other with Italian beef &amp; giardiniera. I must say.. OMG .. can they make a pizza! Its not soggy at all &amp; they use Serano cheese (I believe), which just dominates all the pizza places around here. They were generous with the giardiniera &amp; had a great ratio of italian beef as well. 
I&#39;ve also ordered their Cod fish sandwich here over 4x now. The fish is a nice thick cut fried to a nice crisp &amp; topped with cheese, romaine &amp; as much tartar sauce as you&#39;d like. I honestly forgot but it miiight come with a tomato slice, lol. The bun is nice &amp; airy with an oily sheen on top. Everything paired well together.
I also had a side of spuds which were nice, my favorite is mozzarella &amp; pesto. The only problem is now they use crinkle fries, back maybe more than half a year ago they used actual &#34;spuds (wedges of potatoes, skin &amp; all),&#34; now their the frozen fries identical from the ones at White Castle.

If i could change one thing it would be the pizza marinara sauce. It&#39;s really good but on the more saltier side &amp; i.m.o needs a little more sweetness."

Pizza was &#34;meh&#34;... I always thought a true sign of good pizza is when you have it cold the next day and it still tastes delicious. Well, we never really experienced the pizza hot to begin with, as for the most part, it was luke warm at best by the time we dug in. In my opinion, the pizza had way too much cheese and the chicken that was on it was rather bland and dry. On the other hand, the fried zucchini sticks were decent, but my vegan friend wasn&#39;t too impressed.

Today was my second time experiencing Italian Pizza Kitchen and honestly it will be my last! Two months ago I ordered the margarita pizza and it was cold, flavorless and lacked cheese. Since it was my first time, I chose not to complain. 

Well today I gave them a second chance and when I placed my order I mentioned to them the issue I had with my previous pizza. This time I decided to add a few ingredients (similar to my favorite pizza place) hoping it would be just as good. Their margarita pizza normally only comes with plum tomatoes, fresh basil, olive oil and topped with mozzarella cheese. I added garlic and marinara sauce to give it added flavor. I also asked that they make sure it has cheese on it throughout and that it be hot.  

HERE WE GO.....
The pizza arrived and I was APPALLED! It was once again cold,dry, and lacked cheese. It looked like crackers. Not to mention they did not put the plum tomatoes on the pizza. To make things worse, I called and spoke with Carmen (manager) and he was extremely rude. He was not empathetic to the situation at all and even tried going tit for tat with me. He told me the tomatoes were not added because I added marinara sauce. REALLY! When you add something it doesn&#39;t mean take something away! Then he referenced my  previous experience as told to the order taker telling me &#34;you had an issue last time too&#34;. You right, I did and I was reassured it wouldn&#39;t happen this time. He went on to tell me that margarita pizzas are not suppose to have much cheese on them! WHERE IS HE GETTING HIS INFORMATION FROM??? Every margarita pizza I have had had plenty of mozzarella cheese on it. He told me the pizza came out of a 500 degree oven then boxed and sent directly to me. Well, I don&#39;t know what happened between it coming out of the oven and delivered, but it was very cold. He kept asking me if I wanted a new one sent out with my tomatoes added and I told him NO! If they messed it up twice why would I give them a third try? I told him I wanted something else or my money refunded. He placed me on hold. Then Rosa (owner) picked up and was very empathetic. She apologized and was more interested in rectifying the problem. I ordered the boneless buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing and they were okay. 

Ultimately, I was not charged for the $19 crackers but I do not think I will be ordering from here again. Sorry, but I can get a better pizza for less than $10 at Domino&#39;s. Perhaps things could have been different if I had better customer service. There&#39;s too much competition in the pizza world to lack in this area."

We actually found them here on, Yelp! After reading many good reviews, we gave it a try.. we are thrilled that we did! 

We ordered many different things, over the course of two months. (Yes, I will admit- we became a slightly addicted to their food! Ordering four times in one week! No joke!)
First being Alfredo with stuffed cheese  ravioli- which was very good!! I find it to be a rather hard challenge.. Finding good pasta dishes when ordering in. 
Their wedges are AMAZING! Not only are they good, it&#39;s a huge order. We&#39;ve tried basically all of the different ways they can be made, we love them all. 

Their pizza has to be one of the best pizza joints around. No joke! We are pizza snobs.. Not only was the pizza piping hot when it arrived, when we would reheat the left overs, the pizza tasted just as good as it did when arriving after being freshly made. 
Their cold subs are pretty good. However, I was a little weirded out, when mine came with four huge fresh mozzarella balls. (Yes, they were huge and round, they basically took over the sub.) their bread is always very fresh. 
Chicken is pretty good! It came with four to five rather large prices, along with fresh bread, cole slaw and wedges. Chicken is always very fresh, warm and very crispy. 

We also tried their out if this world amazing brownies. Yummy! We heated ours up, and added ice cream. You just cannot go wrong with that dessert. Cheese cake was very good- typical Eli&#39;s brand. 

Only one item we ordered, that we sadly ended up throwing out after the first bite. Sadly, it&#39;s one of our favs..fried zucchini. They also do not serve it with any type of sauce. They were SO mushy! Honestly, they were gross. 
After ordering many times, we finally received a coupon for 30% off our entire order. Awesome! Well, not so much when we called to place our order. The gal taking our order ended up being slightly rude, when we mentioned our coupon. Asking us over and over again what code was printed on the coupon. Almost not believing us, that they in fact had a coupon out for 30% off! (They staple it to the box, and no coupon code is provided on the coupon)
In the long run, we did receive 30% off. 

Overall, great place with great food! Only wish they offered more coupons then the one 30% off coupon we received after placing many orders. (20 plus)"

I&#39;ve tried many different varieties of pizza here...favorites below:
Buffalo Chicken Pizza - this is unlike any buff chick pizza I&#39;ve ever had. It is so incredibly cheesy, delicious and stuffed full of flavor! My only recommendation is ask for it to be made without onions or bacon. Trust me, I LOVE bacon but it&#39;s gotta be crispy and it is not when in the pizza. The onions are too much for this pizza. Ask for extra ranch!
Margarita - this is my second fave. Again, another pizza I&#39;ve tried at many different places, but IPK does it the best.
Standard sausage/pepperoni/cheese - even the norm is incredible. 

There is something about the cheese, sauce, crust combination that makes me want to stuff myself silly. If only they delivered 30 miles away!"

We&#39;ve spent several hundreds of dollars with this Roselle location in deliveries over the past 3 months. When we ask about using a coupon on their menu we just got from them about a week ago for free wings, they said the coupon was expired end of February. We looked and found it was in fact expired. When we got our food we got a new menu, which still had the February expiration date on it, except it now has a rubber stamp date on it til July. How can they send out a menu with coupons that have expired then refuse to take them, only to send you more showing expired but altered with a rubber stamp???? When we called today to complain and get the wings refunded back to us for last nights order we were turned down..saying they can&#39;t give away the business. Well, they just gave up my business. If they can&#39;t see their way to honor a coupon they know is expired when they give it to me and then send me another one with a rubber stamp date over the pre-printed date which is expired, they don&#39;t need my business. Their food is good, kinda pricy but food quality was worth it. That said no amount of good food can negate to poor customer service and misleading menus that seem to be out of date, misleading on products available and misleading on coupons offered, at least as the mood fits them. No more business from us, they will be a few hundred dollars less profitable now, hope it was worth the trade off vs just honoring your coupons.

(UPDATE #2)
Owners contacted us only after seeing negative review on Yelp saying they wanted to make things right...after 2 phone calls the previous day to try to make this right they now WANT to make things right after seeing posting in Yelp. My fiance called and spoke with one of the two owners but they were only willing to make things right, ON THEIR TERMS. What started out as wanting them to honor a coupon THEY SENT US IN THEIR MENU A WEEK AGO FOR FREE WINGS AND THEY REFUSED TO DO AT THE TIME OF THE ORDER,  them saying it was expired, only to have them send us our order the other night with the same menu, same expired date of February 28th but then a rubber stamp over that saying expired July, and in the owners reply to me in Yelp acknowledging both the clerk who took the order, and the other owner who we called yesterday should have honored the coupon and refunded us...was only recognized after they are called out in public here on Yelp. Still, they then expect that just a coupon or a future discount will suffice....not a chance after putting us through all this when all we wanted in the beginning was them to honor the coupon THEY sent us. Very dishonorable business, shady practice, deliberate misleading menu fliers and non-caring owner. I can&#39;t stress enough to anyone thinking about going to this restaurant or ordering from them SHOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS RESTAURANT EVER!!!!!"

Lets face it, the order taker blew it, her manager blew it and then the 2nd manager only took 1 step forward to correct it but only on THEIR terms.  Sorry.  Three days of inconvenience and aggravation isn&#39;t worth your unknown % off.  They don&#39;t need our business, that&#39;s evident.  And now they&#39;ve lost it.

My only complaint is definitely a first-world problem.  Their menu is HUGE and everything on it looks delicious.  Therefore, I had a hard time narrowing down my choices!  Wahwah.

We ordered around 6 pm on a Saturday night, and our food was going to be delivered within the hour (it was!!)

We ordered:
8 buffalo wings (bone in)
Medium thin-crust pizza w/ half cheese and half sausage
Tortellini Veneziana (sans the peas--I megaloathe peas)

Let me just say that everything was amazing.  EVERYTHING.  My husband likes his wings hot, and I am pretty white when it comes to spice pallets.  We both agreed that these wings were a great compromise.  The flavor is REALLY good, and then the heat sort of sneaks up on you.  So it was the best of both worlds, in my opinion.  They were really meaty, too.  There&#39;s nothing worse than bony wings!

The pizza was really, really good.  It wasn&#39;t TOO saucy, the cheese was delicious, and the crust wasn&#39;t soggy at all, which I loved.  The sausage was spiced well and completely delicious.  I can&#39;t wait to try more of their pizza!

My favorite part of the meal, however was the tortellini.  It was stuffed with Asiago cheese, and was nestled in one of the best-tasting alfredo sauce I have ever had.  All of the cflavors worked so well together.  And it wasn&#39;t swimming in the sauce, but there was plenty of it.  It was the perfect balance!

It&#39;s only a couple blocks from our home and very convenient.  Lately the pizza has been very soggy and greasy, so we&#39;ve been thinking about switching to another place.

I happened to discover Italian Pizza Kitchen when we attempted to order pizza for lunch at my place of work. Our usual place had just gone out of business.  The other nearby places weren&#39;t open for lunch, so I called Italian Pizza Kitchen.  The pizza was great and everyone at the office really enjoyed it.  The ingredients including cheese were all very generous and the prices not out of line.  We&#39;ve since been ordering from them on a regular basis.

I&#39;m thrilled that our home is also within their delivery area.  We have ordered delivery three times now, and we&#39;ve been pleased each time.  Last week, we used the coupon for the free wings with pizza purchase.  We really loved those as well."

It was excellent - better than the thin crust, and the toppings were appropriate.  We will probably try the stuffed pizza next.  Still a big fan. (still a 4 star :)
EDIT:  So the owner invited me back to try his new recipe for their crusts, and I agree the crusts are MUCH better.  That time I ordered I think the staff may have known why I was getting another pizza though because it had more than the usual amount of toppings (good for me !), and the next time the topping were more the normal amount.    The toppings taste fresh and the staff was nice.  So I&#39;m upgrading them to a 4 star :)

Original review: It&#39;s ok. The toppings are good but the dough is plain. I&#39;ve definitely had better. (3 star)"

I prefer service with a smile :-) .. it makes food taste much better. Throwing a CC receipt at me to sign just makes the experience worse, and this isn&#39;t the first bad experience I had here with service.

With so many pizza places in the area, they should have better service, as their food IS that much better than their competition.

Well, I&#39;m happy to report that this place may have sidelined our old reliable place for some upcoming occasions. Cheese is great. Sausage was good -- needs a bit more of a kick though. Crust is great. 

Best of all, they know how to cook a pizza well done.

They brought it out to us as it came ready, piping-hot. Wings were perfect, Calamari was fresh and delicious, the Calzone which they called a Jumbo Panzerotti was perfect for two. Everything was well baked (not greasy), fresh, and presented home-made. This was like a restaurant! Quality was outstanding, seriously not what you would expect. Really glad to come here for a lunch.

My gnocchi florentine was well seasoned and the sauce didn&#39;t ovepower the pasta (there have been times recently where the pasta was hidden under way-too-much sauce).

The pastas are always just right, the sauces are flavorful and the pizza, heaven. The thin crust cheese, well done so the cheese is lightly browned is my favorite. The margarita pizza with a sooooo thin crispy crust is excellent. 

I love the stuffed breadsticks dipped in the marsala sauce. The cheese ravioli in meat sauce is just right. My husband loves the fettuccine, broccoli and shrimp. The gnocchi Florentine makes me moan with pleasure! 

I always wonder how they get the fried calamai and breaded mushrooms to our house and they are still crispy...most sit down restaurants can&#39;t get them from the kitchen to the table without them turning soggy.

We&#39;ve ordered catering: lasagna, fried chicken and Italian beef and gotten nothing but rave reviews. John has worked with us on an antipasto salad that is superb.

I had Lou Malnati&#39;s first, and seriously wondered why people think it&#39;s worth it.  Never had a good pizza from Lou&#39;s!  Gino&#39;s East wasn&#39;t any better.  Uno&#39;s was okay, but Giordano&#39;s really showed me that deep dish pizza could be delicious.

Okay, so you&#39;re probably wondering what that has to do with Italian Pizza Kitchen.

I have had their thick crust pizza several times  and really enjoyed it, but only for the first time recently did I have their deep dish pizza and it was fantastic!  Slightly buttery (non cornmeal-type) crust.  The sauce was perfectly seasoned, with a slight marinara taste.  The cheese was perfect and there was so much of it.  Good pizzas do not skimp on cheese!  We had it with two ingredients and they tasted really good.

In quality, IPK&#39;s deep dish is comparable to Giordano&#39;s (and far, far, far x100) better than Lou&#39;s or Gino&#39;s East.  In price, it was better than any of the chain places.  If you&#39;re in the Roselle area, don&#39;t waste your time or money on those chains.

IPK has a sign in their window saying something to the effect of, &#34;Independent pizza places are better than chains.  Come in and we&#39;ll prove it.&#34;

Prove it they did!"

I ordered the chef sandwich, it was roast beef, sauteed onions and mushrooms, and melted swiss cheese on a garlic french roll. While i waited for it i ordered a slice of cheese pizza since the pepperoni was in the oven. It was a little cold and the cheese wasnt melty and stringy, but the flavor was on point. Dont knkw if sauce is house made, but it has a lot of flavor and they didnt use too much sauce, just the way i like my pizza, a little on the dry side so good job there. My sandwich took around 10 minutes to come out, but i was still working on my slice of pizza so i didnt mind. Btw, for $3.25 the slice was pretty big. Finally my cheesy beef came out and lord it looked amazing. Roast beef with mushrooms and onions covered in melted cheese, what more could you want! Sad to say, i was already full when i started working on it. Took the rest home and now in looking forward to eating it at home later. Most def will be back."

The food, in general, at Italian Pizza Kitchen is fantastic.  The ingredients are fresh and &#34;Mom&#34; puts it all together.  The tortellini is amazing!  Everyone in my party, two to six on each visit, was thoroughly satisfied with their dining choice.

The pizza is what sets this place apart.  The secret, and I shall not tell, is in the cheese.  It is the best cheese I have tasted in a long time... reminiscent of that used years ago at Rosie&#39;s Pizza in my hometown.  Of all of the Chicago staples - Geno&#39;s, Nancy&#39;s, Giordano&#39;s, etc. - none of them have it!  Because of that reason alone, IPK is my top choice for pizza in Chicago, and it&#39;s well worth the drive to Roselle!  

If it&#39;s not IPK, I&#39;d rather do without!

Mind you, it&#39;s been over a year since I last visited... very memorable, as if last week!"

I have ordered appetizers, pasta dishes,sandwiches ribeye excellent and philly, wings are extremely tasty there not tiny ones very filling and meaty also burgers are awesome would definetley recommend. I have not tried their pizza yet but i read the reviews and going to try next. Also one more thing i ordered spumoni ice cream they forgot sent a driver right away to bring it no questions excellent service i think. So all and all go there or order delivery you will be impressed. Oh by the way if anyone from italian pizza kitchen reads this you guys got to change hours for friday it says closed so not good because if i was looking for italian on yelp i would move on just a little help if it was my first time."

Up until now, I have not been a huge fan as you might see in my two prior reviews. The first time we went was when they first opened and they had not quite gotten their act together. We went back a few more times before I wrote my second review, which unfortunately was not too much different than my first one.

Being a local business, we have returned periodically and I have not updated anything posted here. I admit, things got better over the years as the business became more established. Lily&#39;s is now a staple in the plaza with many regulars.

When we arrived today, there were three of us - my wife, her business partner and me. As I remember from my earlier visits, the servers sit or stand by the bar in the back and yell that you should sit anywhere. I have to admit, this didn&#39;t start the visit well. But, they turned it around. After a few minutes, they came by with chips and salsa and asked for drink orders. I had a coke, while the Ladies had Margueritas. 

I should have gotten our server&#39;s name as I think he did a great job. My wife and I ordered the Taco Platter, and her business partner had the Enchilada Dinner. You have your choice of meats, so I had one chicken, one steak, and one chorizo. The meal is served with refried beans (which were made fresh) and Spanish rice. Kerrie had ground beef in her tacos.

Here is the good - the food was fresh. The meats were well seasoned - especially the chorizo.  The tacos are served with onion, cilantro, lettuce and tomato. They also come with cheese, but I had mine without. Kerrie added a side order of Guacamole. 

The not so good - I ordered flour tortillas, but they came out with corn tortillas. I asked for no cheese or sour cream, but it was served with cheese on the beans. The rice was overcooked. Lastly, the Coke was flat and had too much syrup - it was way too thick and sweet.

Since my request about the cheese was due to an allergy, I asked them to take it back and replace it, I chose not to mention any of the rest. I think they not only replaced the beans but actually remade the meal. After that, everything went well.

Even though there were some minor issues, the one I brought to their attention was corrected quickly and in a good manner. I have no doubt they would have also done something about the other issues, but I did not ask them to nor did I even mention it.

So, I am pleased to update my review to reflect more of what others have been saying about it for all of these years."

First time I was here everything was pretty good (food, service, and price). The 2nd time around my order over the phone was all wrong after it was repeated at least 3 times. This time when I called the lady told me to hang tight for 3 minutes... 3 minutes passes, 5 minutes passed, 8 minutes passed and 10 minutes passed. I hung up and just decided to walk in (since I was already by the neighborhood). I came in there was 1 table of 2 and a table of 6. That&#39;s it! Phone was not ringing and the lady who was taking order was just chilling watching tv. She was quick to take my order there but apparently she forgets about the people waiting on the phone. Overall, I gave Lily&#39;s Mexican restaurant 2 stars because of the lack of service."

I ordered the chimichanga and it was excellent!! I devoured it. It came out a little greasy but that&#39;s expected because it is fried dish. It absolutely did not take away from the taste. The beef was tender, tasty and there was a lot of it! The entire chimichanga was beef! For $10.50, it is quite the deal. They topped it with cheese and a red sauce - delicious!

The outside is not appealing. Granted, most Mexican joints look like this all over Chicago, it is pretty nice inside with a bar in the back. It&#39;s not quite taco diner like some places in Chicago but it&#39;s not a full blown extravagant restaurant setting either. It&#39;s good for groups and chit chatting with friends. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place for a romantic dinner, that&#39;s for sure.  They&#39;re very fast and their horchata is quite delicious.

I had ordered a bit of food that day to share with my fam and I wasn&#39;t disappointed in any of it. The chile rellenos was delicious and so were the chicken flautas. I&#39;ve had the fish, pork, and steak tacos and all of them were pretty darn good. The salsas they offer with the meals gave a great spice to everything (and I got some to go to save at the house).

- Shrimp Taco (2/10)
- Chips &amp; Salsa (5/10)

C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!
Sorry, I gotta be the first to give the bad review :(

Ok, I actually did try more things. There was a tamale, enchilada, and a taco, and I don&#39;t remember them being that great, but I don&#39;t remember anything substantial about them, so I&#39;ll just ignore that. Probably means that there wasn&#39;t anything worthwhile about them. Like I said, I do remember thinking they weren&#39;t that great. 

The one thing that DOES stay fresh in my mind is the shrimp tacos... oh and the chips.

Salsa was actually pretty good. Had that fresh taste to it and had a kick. Great job! However, the chips were sorta run of the mill and I&#39;m not a fan of thin tortilla chips. This is like the minimum I&#39;d expect from any Mexican restaurant, so nothing good, nothing bad to say about the chips &amp; salsa.

Now, the shrimp taco. The shrimp was overcooked and super chewy. Shrimp Jerky? The rest of the taco itself was just so boring! I squeezed a lime, and used salsa just so I can make that tiny taco bearable. It had onion and cilantro, so I got at least those flavors, but there was a gigantic chunk of onion (mis-chopped?) in a bite that really threw me for a loop."

Wow to their mole: fragrant and aromatic- I could drink it.

The decor is nothing special at all. Standard strip mall setup. The staff is nice but do seem rushed a lot of the time (even when it&#39;s slow). The horchata is very good and the complimentary chips and salsa are alright. The dish I mentioned above are the shrimp tacos. They&#39;re phenomenal. A STRONG amount of kick but still a great flavor (I get mine with sour cream b/c I&#39;m a baby). However, the other items I&#39;ve had there are just standard fare.

We started with the Chips which were good and the salsa was fresh(not as hot as I prefer but still good).   I tried the tacos(Asada and Pastor)  The meat was a bit on the smoky tasting side, the Asada(steak) was ok though.  As far as the Pastor it had to many onions and it was on the sweet side(not to my liking).  Next we had a gordita and a shrimp taco, the gordita was over done and the shrimp taco was ok.  Unfortunately they use yellow corn shells for the tacos and they are rather thick.  Using White Corn would give a person a better experience.  I gave this 3 stars as it was an average meal, but I do go to 3 other Mexican restaurants and I doubt that I will return due to the above mentioned issues.

i had to try the shrimp tacos after the various reviews and the one mean one. They were very very good. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, spiced nicely. No heat, but the complimentary salsa took care of that!  My husband had a combo with chile rellano and steak. They steak was literally as tender as a filet, and so well seasoned.

Had a hot dog with fries and it just did not do it for me. The dog was average at best and the fries were just ugh. Tasted like old fries in old oil. Sad but true.

I found the price for a hot dog and fries at $3.79 before tax so high. Make it $4.17 with tax for a skinny dog with fries.

Service was friendly so that&#39;s a plus.

Many better hot dog joints around than here. Can&#39;t speak for the other menu items, just the hot dogs.

In Chicagoland most beefs are just beefs. I still think Portillos Buona and Mr Beef have the best beefs in Chicagoland with Portillos ahead of them all. I just tried the Bubby special. It is meatballs italian beef red sauce mozz and I got it with sweet peppers dipped juicy. The flavor was damn good. I couldnt pinpoint a flavor whether it was the meatballs beef or sauce but ot was damn good. The fries are absolutely awesome. It was a very heavy meal. I would really loce to try the meatball sandwich and the italian beef because combined they were awesome. Now I need to review them seperate because I can never find a good meatball sandwhich. I have a feeling id really enjoy Bubbys. Overall a good experience. The best thing about the place is the owner is there everyday and hasnt missed a day in 12 years. They are closed Sat and Sund. The owners presence and ability to provide customer care immediately when you walk up to the counter is rare and awesome. I will absolutely return to review more of the menu. Great sandwich.

We had pre-ordered our food because we only have a 30 minute lunch, and I am happy to report the food came up right when we got there, so they did know how to time it correctly for our arrival time. 

I opted for a combo lunch that was listed in the menu we had at our office as $7.99. Evidently, we had an old menu because my price when I paid for my lunch was $9.60. I had 4 of my coworkers behind me and I was not about to question it because it probably was an old menu. Just paid and that was that. 

I received my order at the counter and it was my combo sandwich, well done sausage as requested. And the sausage was decent. Thank you, Bubby&#39;s for that. The Italian beef was not exactly a $9.00 sandwich if you know what I&#39;m saying. The meat was dry and a little chewy. :( The bread was fresh and &#34;wet&#34; as ordered. I am fully aware that it wasn&#39;t $9.00 for just the sandwich and the fries and drink were also included, but almost $10.00 for some very greasy fries, a fountain drink and an okay sandwich kinda broke my heart.

All of my coworkers ordered combos and I saw how much waste there was at the end of the meal. Not one person finished their fries and some not even their sandwiches or hot dogs. I later figured out that the fries were just too darn greasy for everyone, so they didn&#39;t eat them all. While they tasted pretty good, the grease was overwhelming. Kinda ruined them.

Lastly, the gentleman behind the counter offered to refill our sodas before we headed back to the office; SCORE!!! I figured out at the car that he had refilled my diet coke in my coworkers cup of iced tea and her iced tea in my cup of diet coke. Icky! This is not a combination of beverages I can work with. Perhaps Cherry coke and regular coke, but not tea and diet. :/

Guess if I try them again, I&#39;ll just go for the hot dog for half the price and make sure my drink is right before I leave."

Probably the best fries I&#39;ve ever had.  Fresh cut right in front of you.  Plus barbecue sauce on the tables!  Great for the fries!

Very friendly workers and customers.  Kinda small interior, but a lot of people take their food to go so it really doesn&#39;t end up very crowded, even at your standard busy lunch times.  Expect to pay from $6-$10 depending on what you get.

I went in around 2pm on a Thursday I believe.  They had a buffet so I decided to go with that.  I normally skip buffets and order off a menu, but, their buffet looked large, clean, and lots of good things to choose from.  The only thing that let me down was one of the chicken dishes.  It was under the heat light too long and very dried out (I was dining near the end of the buffet, in fact it was closed down while I was eating desert).  So maybe if I do the buffet again I will come a bit earlier.  But everything else was great!  Food was authentic and wonderful!

I sat at the bar and ordered a margarita, which was very good but a bit different tasting than I am used to.  The owner (I believe he was the owner, otherwise like the head manager) was very attentive.  He kept my water filled, stopped by often to ask if I needed anything, and to top it all off he even got me dessert!  The buffet was closing and I was still eating my 2nd plate from the buffet.  He actually went and got me a plate of mixed dessert before the dessert buffet was taken down.  Very nice!  And the dessert was amazing too!  They had this almond, vanilla, coconut ice cream.  Not sure what they call it, but damn it was good!

So for my rating.  I was going to give 4 stars simply due to the one piece of dry chicken I had.  But, everything else was great, and the service was simply amazing.  So 5 stars it is!"

It was not too busy for any carelessness.  I silently asked our server(the only lady server at that time) to bring us kulfi with a candle for my wife.  That never happened. My wife ordered thali for both of us and it was not served in a thali. The menu said it would have soup and other items,  soup never made to our table. 

We also asked the lady server to get the food made spicy. It was bland even for my wife who eat way less spicier than I do. On the top the lemon had it&#39;s brand sticker on it.

Over all food was OK, not that bad. And the experience also got saved because of the old server who was a wonderful host. He was very sweet and a wonderful representation of an Indian host."

I am not a fan of quantity in buffet but at least expect some good buffet items should be there which was none. Only yellow daal, no daal makhani, panner was just ok, tandoori chicken was dry though had some flavors. Who eats chana daal and broccoli in buffet?
Anyways still i can come back again for their signature orange ice cream. It was wonderful and yum. Probably may try ala carte one day"

Not many customers, probably like few groups of people alone and then big group of Indian families at the other side of the dining area.

We ordered the regular and mango lassi, just the right amount of sugar and tasted great! 

Bf got the lamb curry (?) and I got the vegetable makhani. Both very good. We also ordered the panini nan and the garlic nan, thy also gave us some rice with the meal which was nice.

We ended up not finishing the two currys or the nan, pretty big portion for us, about $50 for the two of us, 2 drinks, 2 currys, and 2 type of nans, not too bad.

1. Waited at the counter to be seated by someone, anyone. No one would seat me. It wasn&#39;t until a woman (who happened to be white) came to pay for her meal that the man at the bar, who had been ignoring me the whole time, finally gestured to me that he&#39;d seat me. His attentive treatment of the white customer didn&#39;t phase me until he progressively treated me poorly. I should&#39;ve left then but I had been wanting to try this place for awhile.

2. Man who ignored me points to the corner and I don&#39;t understand what he means. He then rudely asks if the corner is ok. I say fine and sit in the damn corner. At this point I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m being treated so poorly because a) poor service is what they do, b) it&#39;s just me instead of a group so I&#39;m low priority, or c) because I&#39;m wanting to eat while black. I&#39;m thinking all 3. Either way I shouldn&#39;t even have had these thoughts because you know... Quality service. Which I expected but clearly shouldn&#39;t have.

3. No one brought me a menu, I would&#39;ve liked to have ordered tea but nope, no water for the outcast in the corner. I didn&#39;t even want the lunch buffet but at this point I just got up and went for it. No need to even review the food. It wasn&#39;t good at all, not even review worthy. Thankfully there&#39;s Chicago Curry House and Jaipur Indian among others in the city who have great food and fantastic service. 

4. At the buffet, I was being monitored by the man who conveniently chose to ignore me and then sit me in the corner. I wonder if I would&#39;ve spilled food or misplaced the serving spoon, would he have snapped at me. Luckily the poor treatment didn&#39;t go that far but it didn&#39;t stop there, sadly.

5. I pay for the lackluster food $15?!?! The guy was quick to get that process going at the bar! I hand him my card and he walks off to the counter with the register. He brings back a portable card machine and sets it to the tipping screen. I make sure to get off the tipping screen because no tips were deserved at this restaurant. None! Whatsoever! He slaps my card down on the sticky bar and I could barely lift my card up. Such an asshole move. I sign the receipt and pick the other one up off the bar too and walk tf out.

Never again. Shitty food. Shitty service. The man with the earring in his ear has some serious problems and should be banned from the restaurant industry.

My tip: Don&#39;t renew your commercial lease for 2016."

This was my first foray into Indian food, so I admittedly have no idea what I&#39;m talking about :)  I did have a wonderful Sherpa in Taylor M. however.  We ordered the Murg Makhani, the Paneer Sashlik, and a plain Nan.  I am kind of a whimp when it comes to spicy foods, so we requested for mild sauces and seasonings.  It didn&#39;t take long to receive our food, and it looked great.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was all very delicious, and not too spicy!  The Murg Makhani was especially good.  Again, I have no previous experience with Indian food, but I was very pleased with my experience here.  I&#39;m looking forward to trying more Indian dishes, and eating at Gaylord&#39;s again.

The parking lot was deserted and there was a big sign that said &#34;GAYLORD&#34;. Like, what?

But it was because the restaurant just reopened for dinner and we were the first party there. There were more patrons coming in as it got closer to dinner time.

We ordered samosas for appetizer and it was yummy! It was so hot and fresh and it was very rich in flavor.

We also shared the chicken tikka masala, shrimp masala, and garlic nan.

OMG the garlic nan was pure heaven. I can eat that by itself forever. It is the Indian style of garlic bread but it was so warm and soft and so chewy! I love dipping it with the two curries.

The two portions of masalas were huge and between two starving girls, we ate about half of each and took the rest home. Both masalas were delicious and I would recommend both, depending on what type of meat you like.

This restaurant is more upscale compared to all the other Indian restaurants I have been, too so it is a bit pricier. But it was like paying for two meals, so it is totally worth it!

They also offer AYCE for lunch and my friends went and said it is decent, but the quality isn&#39;t the same as dinner since they have to mass produce and keep fresh."

Yet, I decided to try it for the first time after moving 7 hours away north to Minnesota. Not sure why I have never tried it before. I seldom have craving for Indian food and when I did previously, I always went to India House. We almost went to India House again until a friend insisted on Gaylord. Glad he did!!

My last Indian meal was when I was packing to move to Minnesota, my awesome ex neighbor Neha made me a plate of wonderful food of chicken tikka, palak paneer, and some rice for lunch while my movers had to eat crappy Jimmy John&#39;s. She was so sweet and it tasted so good. However, it was two years ago! It was about time to get curry wasted and maybe even getting some fra afterward. It was time for some good Indian buffet! 

Gaylord, despite that it reminded me of Ben Stiller&#39;s character in &#34;Meet The Parents,&#34; was an awesome restaurant. The place itself was pretty nice and they put the buffet right by the front foor. Once you came in, you could smell all those good food. There was a glass window to the kitchen where you could watch naan being made fresh in the tandoor oven. That was so cool!

We had a big table of 10 and they were very accommodating in getting us set up. The owner or manager was there helping us being flaky about whether we needed an extra table to be added or not. He was very patient and funny that he set the mood right.

The food...oh! It was delicious!! I usually hate buffet but I love Indian buffet. I like it because I can try a whole bunch of shit I didn&#39;t know whether I would like it or not. Ordering from a menu, I never knew what to order. Plus, dinner at Indian restaurant tend to be very pricy for small portion of that metal mini wok looking bowl thingy. However, buffet? For real cheap, you get to try various types of foods and some you may just want a bite of it, you know? It was the perfect way for me.

I also had a couple of must have items when I go for Indian buffet - good hot naan (checked) and chicken tikka masala. They didn&#39;t have chicken tikka that day but had shrimp tikka that was really amazing. I tried their lentil soup, chicken tandoori,  and the chicken curry and all was great too! Nothing that I ate tasted bad. The lunch items were fantastic. Really fantastic.

I was a bit disappointed with the desserts. They didn&#39;t have mango ice cream but had coconut ice cream instead. The gulab jamun was also not the kind I like. I like it more milky tasting. This one was just sweet and a bit much cardamom.

Service was a bit slow also. We had to keep flagging someone to clear plates or refill our drinks. We didn&#39;t really know who was waiting on us. They also charged us for two kids at $7 a pop. The two kids we had were 3 and 2 years old who barely eat anything else but their own cheerios and maybe a little rice and naan. My friend questioned it and they took the charges off.

However, I am a fan of Gaylord now! I would be dreaming of that chicken curry and fresh naan awhile. It was so good and I was unscathed with no Bombay&#39;s revenge. It kept me full all day that I skipped dinner. It was an awesome cheap delicious lunch!"

A few months ago, however, we went there for a dinner- and it was outright horrible. I swear the spinach paneer had no spices in it at all, and was extremely oily. We complained to the waiter and he just shrugged his shoulders . I wrote a bad non-anonymous review with my Email provided on the restaurant review form, but received no response or apology.

Unfortunately our daughter and son in law did not remember that we told them never to go there again. So last week they had the same horrible experience with the buffet.

I am at a loss about what could have happened to this previously great restaurant . We asked the waiter if there is a new cook, but he said &#34;cook is same&#34;.

I should note that both me and my husband are pretty good Indian cooks and know when food has been seriously messed with.

I have enjoyed EVERYTHING that I have tried off the menu...and I&#39;ve tried a LOT! :) Not only is the taste good, but the service is wonderful as well! They also have a gluten free and Vegan menu available! Now to the fun stuff...what to feed your belly! 

Appetizers: 
Vegetarian Samosas - very tasty dumplings stuffed with potatoes and peas.
Bhindi Amchur - If you like okra, this is pretty tasty...fried okra w/ some awesome spices
Bhel poori or sev batata poori - Kind of like Indian nachos! 

Tandoor Items:
Tandoori chicken = YUM - Perfectly cooked and not dry!
Chicken Kati Kabab = MY FAVORITE....chicken w/ cream cheese and other yumminess!!!! You have to try this item! :) 
Seekh kababs - My other FAVORITE tandoor item! 
Chicken tikka
Chicken malai kabab - this one is marinated in a yogurt...very tasty! 

Chicken:
Chicken Makhani - A staple in Indian food. Very good for people who are trying Indian food for the first time! It is boneless chicken in a buttery tomato sauce! 
Chef&#39;s Special Chicken - YUM! Has bell peppers, onions, and Indian spices.

Lamb:
Rogan Josh - Lamb cooked in a tomato onion gravy. One of my fav lamb dishes. 
Lamb Bhuna - Not bad...not as saucy...more so dry spices. I prefer the other w/ gravy. 

Fish:
Fried fish is DELISH!

Vegetarian:
Aloo dahi wala - Potatoes in a yogurt based sauce. My fav veggie dish! 
Paneer makhani- paneer (cheese) in a buttery tomato sauce. 
Gobhi Manchurian - A chinese/Indian fusion - battered cauliflower in Manchurian sauce. 

Naans - I like plain, but whatever your preference is!

And you have to wash it down with a mango lassi!!!! If you want something more along the lines of an adult beverage, try one of the Indian beers...King Fisher or Taj mahal. 

Dessert: Always love the kulfi (Indian ice cream) they have it in Mango, pistachio, or coconut. Gulab jamuns are good but have a reputation for being really sweet...they are, but don&#39;t take the syrup and kind of squish it out...lol. I LOVE the gulab jamuns! Ras Malai is good as well!

I have been going to Gaylord for many years and my sister even had her wedding reception catered from this restaurant.

Regardless, today&#39;s experience included almost 15+ minutes before a waiter greeted us at our table, another 30 to 40 min to get our meal, which hilariously felt cold on some of the dishes and overcooked on others. I typically give a restaurant like this the benefit of the doubt as i have come here so often and know they can do high quality work. Todays experience could be the result of just being a busy weekend night, holiday, etc. 

However, what really irked me was that they added a service charge for a table of 5, of which one was a baby! I even questioned the waiter and he confirmed that this is their policy now. Then for some reason he walked away from the table even though I had my credit card ready and that cost us another 10 min!

I typically tip 20% anyway, but on the principle it just didn&#39;t seem right to include that service charge for what felt like a normal size group. Will not be going here much in the future."

Talking about food in buffet. I am a vegetarian. Whatever they had for veggies all of it was good at taste. What I didn&#39;t like was &#34;saag paneer&#34; please please people don&#39;t eat this dish..its the worst what I ate in all my life..and naan was kinda rubber chewy but eatable..give it a shot u won&#39;t be disappointed..at food..but at service u maybe disappointed..I have always noticed when an indian person goes to Indian restaurant he is never treated well by the people ..(but few exceptions)..idk why they have such kind of mentality.."

I&#39;ve had the amchur bendhi which is nice and crunchy and tangy, the veg samosa is nothing to write home about, the lamb biryani is average and the butter chicken/ pasinda also average.
And man is this place PRICEY!!! I hear it&#39;s a very old establishment in general but I really don&#39;t see the appeal. There is nothing exceptional about this place. The waitstaff and surroundings are very nice, but you&#39;re not getting anything way too special here."

Decor:
Very modern, Indian feel to it. It&#39;s very clean for starters.  The tables are always set up nicely, never anything on the floors and the silverware is always impeccably clean as well. 

Service:
The service was quick and friendly.  Never any struggle with the waiter to get water, food or any other questions you need to ask.

Food:
The standard chicken tikka is always amazing with their naan bread.  It&#39;s all baked in a tandoor which gives it&#39;s signature taste.  Very addicting flavors. Also the biryani is amazing.  It&#39;s a cooked rice with either meat, chicken, fish or vegetables.  It can be spicy depending on the person.  If you can&#39;t wait for an appetizer get the samosas.  They are either fried or baked and filled with cooked vegetables. It&#39;s usually served with either a mint chutney or sweet tamarind sauce. Both are delicious. 


Price:
The price is fair for the amount of food you get.  Mainly you&#39;re paying for quality. I&#39;ve only been here twice and usually I&#39;ll order the chicken tikka, biryani, samosa appetizer and anything else I have a taste for. It&#39;s a pretty big menu with a ton of meat and vegetables dishes.  


Overall Experience:
Overall, I liked this place a lot.  Excellent location and always packed.  You&#39;ll have a good time for sure. :-)"

Since we all have a soft spot for Indian food and this is the friend who introduced me to Indian food nearly ten years ago, eating here was a must.

My husband and I sat in the bar for a few moments before they arrived. We decided not to order any drinks but the bartender still brought me a water with a smile. While sitting here, we notice the cheesy Indian show on television, photos of celebrities on the wall, and clash of upscale &amp; casual decor. Not quite sure what feel they&#39;re going for here, but I kind of liked it.

I also noticed many signs advertising a Chat House Dinner Buffet Sundays through Thursdays from 7-9pm for $12.95. The buffet was actually laid out right when you walk in the restaurant, so we were able to take a peek before sitting down at the table. When my friends arrived, we were seated at a table in the very back of the restaurant next to a giant Christmas tree (which confused me a bit). After hearing that the buffet was entirely vegetarian, three of us ended up getting the dinner buffet. My husband stayed unique and opted for his regular Indian dinner: chicken tikka masala with a side of garlic naan.

The dinner buffet consists of:

Pani Puri
Bhel Poori
Dahi Vada
Pav Bhaji
Ragda Patties
Idli
Medu Vada
Vegetable Biriyani

Most of it seemed like small bites and appetizers (and I didn&#39;t know what half of it was!). I ended up getting a lot of Vegetable Biriyani and some other potato-type things and a bread thing and Pav Bhaji. The Vegetable Biriyani was so good -- I got seconds and thirds. The Pav Bhaji was good too, but I&#39;m not a fan of mushy foods, so it wasn&#39;t my favorite. The potato things were fun. (I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not too familiar with the names of the foods and what exactly they are.) Despite the good buffet, I kind of regretted not getting dinner. I missed eating my favorites and filling up on heavier foods. But hey, it&#39;s always good to try new things, right?? And $12.95 for a buffet is a pretty good deal considering that dinner entrees cost more.

Our waiter was very over-attentive. He kept filling up after every sip, or so it seemed! Our glasses always stayed full and our conversation kept getting interrupted for him to bend over us and fill our glasses. It was kind of amusing, but still appreciated. We all had a good time and left pretty happy. I&#39;m glad to add this to my list of recommended Indian restaurants in the area.

Oh, one more thing: the Yelp check-in offers 20% off your meal, but if you get the buffet, you only get 10% off. That was kind of disappointing, but at least I ate my money&#39;s worth!"

We started off with Bhel Puri - Make your own, which was a lot of fun to make and eat. [ Tip  there is a big bowl there to make it and mix it, don&#39;t make same mistake which I made, using small plate]. Then, there was vada with sambhar and chutney, happily made sambhar vada and I loved the Aloo Bonda, that was really good in my opinion. Then, the tandoor chicken and fish fry were good too. 

Among the entrees, the methi mattar, tindoora, shimla aloo,Saag Paneer (Spinach Paneer), Bhaigan bartha(eggplant/brinjal curry) were good. The chicken masala was good too. Naan kept getting empty soon, so be on the watch :p. 

For dessert, there was coconut ice cream, gulab jamun and fruit rabidi. All were good. Service was good as well. 

Two complaints I had - the gulab jamun was not hot, which was a let down. All the items had spice missing for me, so in my opinion food was good, but not authentic spicy, made to cater a more larger audience.

But as we all know it will be hard to find parking on the weekend in Downtown Chicago, therefore I went to their location in Schaumburg to give it a try.

The lunch buffet menu is a little bit different form the Chicago location, but taste good as well. Curry Chicken is more spicy hot compare to the Chicago location, so be careful :)

And this is the first time I heard a waiter in a buffet restaurant encourage me to eat more (as we all know buffet waiters just want you to eat quickly and go).

Thank you for the services!

We ordered three rice plates and two drinks. Each of the plates was 22 and only came with 2 curries, plain rice, salad and bread. For 22 this was appalling. Anyway this was not the issue.

Our check came with a large subtotal of 76 without any tax or gratuity. Also the itemized drink was not described properly for 5. Total before tax:81. We inquired what that 76 was for and the waiter said it was correct. When we asked for the menu he refused and then said he will confirm again with the manager. He returned saying it was correct and that the drinks were for two and not three. We insisted that for 3 rice plates for 22 it should be 66 and not 76. After some awkward movements and few trips to the manager, the total was adjusted correctly. Why this drama? 

I knew it before hand that this place was pricey, but the food was supposed to be good. I don&#39;t think the price is truly justified for what they are serving here. It&#39;s too much of the fine cuisine guise and nothing else. The food isn&#39;t bad, but not outstanding for me to return. 

After the drama with the bill I will not be returning here. I think they don&#39;t want people who don&#39;t buy into their fine cuisine extravaganza and who actually look at the bill."

This and Gaylord&#39;s sister restaurant on Walton by Michigan Ave are my two favorite Indian restaurants. I eat a LOT of Indian food and these two are my absolute favorites.

Due to the location, I end up generally ordering out and I order out far more than I can eat so that I have leftovers for like a week. I&#39;ve not really been disappointed by any dish so I will instead call out two of my favorites: Mattar Paneer and Mirgh Badam Pasanda (really Chicken Korma). I find both these dishes to be full of flavor with plenty of cheese and chicken in the respective dishes. Neither dish is overwhelmingly spicy nor should they be and each maintains a great balance and depth of flavor. For me, both set the standard I use to compare other Indian food.

Go and try a bunch of dishes, you won&#39;t be disappointed. Gaylords has a massive variety and a fantastic lunch buffet deal.

Oh, and as a tip, if you say you learned about them online, you get 10% off, pretty sure they still honor that deal that their website had posted a while back."

The chicken is tender and the sauce is delicious and NO I WILL NOT SHARE IT WITH YOU...GET YOUR OWN. (A fact my poor partner knows too well.)      

They usually have a yelp check-in deal for the weekdays for 20% off of your dinner too so it&#39;s definitely worth a try if you haven&#39;t been there before.  Love you, Gaylord."

Finally we did.  We came here for their lunch buffet and we were disappointed.  My review is based on my experience of the Indian food I had, not base on the authenticity because I&#39;ve never been to India to taste the authentic Indian food.  My favorite Indian restaurants in San Francisco(where I live now) are Amber India, Dosa, Shalimar.  They are what I&#39;m comparing my experience at Gaylord against.

1st Disappointment - not much interior décor nor design of the dining or bar area. No ambiance in my opinion.  Just old and shabby.

2nd Disappointment - often we had to ask for service and for our hot water refills

3rd Disappointment - when asked for the type of teas they have, loose leaf teas or tea bags, what type of teas, our waiter replied &#34;Indian tea&#34;.  When asked again, if they are loose leaf or tea bag, are they Darjeeling, Assam, or Ceylon, he replied the same &#34;Indian tea&#34;.  So we just ordered one to try.  It turned out to be a cup of chai looking tea.  I am not an expert of chai tea, but I don&#39;t think that was a very good one due to the lightness and almost watery flavor.

4th Disappointment - their chicken masala is mediocre, the chicken was a bit dry for me, I don&#39;t remember much about the sauce.  They are eatable but not memorable in a good way nor in a bad way.  Which is sad to me.   

1st Pleasant Surprise - their naan is delicious!  We tried their classic naan and their garlic naan, both were very flavorful.  Their naan is on the thinner side the way I prefer.  Parts of it lightly flaky/crispy ad parts moist and chewy.  Yummy!

2nd Pleasant Surprise - their spicy cabbage and Indian style chips are delicious and flavorful.  


This review is for the lunch buffet.  I&#39;m not a fan of buffets.  I think the quality of the entrees deteriorate when served at most buffets.  Maybe their a la carte dishes are better.  I&#39;m not planning to return for 2nd try.  Next time, we&#39;ll give Tandoor Char House and Rangoli in Chicago a try."

This is what I have been craving! 

Been here twice now- once for Sunday Night Chaat Buffet night ($12.95- and it&#39;s a perfect way to end your weekend. Bhel, pani puri, rugro pattice, dahi vada, idli/sambar, pau bhaji... and much more!)

Then for dinner (make sure you check in to yelp/facbook- you&#39;ll get 20% off! your bill) one night where we got two tasting menus- which was enough food to feed us for the next few days- and EVERYTHING was amazing and good! The tasting menu is $23- and great bang for your buck as you will get to sample 5-7 dishes and it&#39;s a lot of food! You could probably even share one with someone else- or do what we did and get TWO different ones!) :) The more- the merrier! Everything had a distinct taste. I am still dreaming about the saag paneer- ooh- it&#39;s the best I have EVER had!

Definitely get naan!!! WOW!!

Owner cares- walks around during dinner (nice touch- don&#39;t see it that much!) Servers are very attentive.

My friend pointed out that from a &#34;meat-like&#34; perspective, all they offered was chicken. One of the reviews I had read referred to seafood, so it&#39;s available - just wasn&#39;t any the day we were there I guess.

Soft drinks are included in the price and while the glasses are small, servers were very attentive about keeping them refilled. Naan was served at the table - wish it had come out of the kitchen a bit warmer though. I called in advance to confirm that the announcement on Yelp about 10% off the lunch buffet was still valid and it was. I printed it out just to be sure - they gave it to us - making the somewhat high lunch buffet price of $12.95 a bit more palatable.

Racism? Maybe. 3rd World Cultural differences? Maybe. Worst Customer Service ever? Maybe. Whatever, I&#39;m starving. Strike #3 After 10 minutes another guy walks up and I ask if we can have some Menu&#39;s   (the Buffet was just nasty). He reluctantly brought us 3 menus and RUDELY said &#34;it&#39;s going to take a long time if you order from the Menu&#34;.  That was it. I had  to struggle to get a seat, I had to struggle to get a menu, then I had to struggle to get something besides the nasty Buffet that I didn&#39;t want. We went to Marianno&#39;s where not only was it easy to get seated, they were nice to us and actually encouraged us to order whatever we wanted, not what they wanted us to get .

They weren&#39;t busy at all - maybe three other tables with people. I have a fondness for Gaylord, because I ate my first Indian food in Chicago at their downtown location probably 35 years ago. Back then, I was mesmerized by the new tastes and combinations. I&#39;ve eaten at their Schaumburg location a couple of times and have been underwhelmed both times. 

I got the vegetarian thali on my most recent visit. I wasn&#39;t asked for my level of heat, which was surprising. The tomato soup was thin and pretty tasteless. I got a lot of rice and peas (a cheap dish to prepare) and less of the other more interesting components. I did like the papadam chips they had when you sat down. And the naan was good. But that&#39;s not enough to bring me back. 

Our service was confusing, as different people kept coming to the table and one male server seemed to be annoyed when my friend asked him what she was eating (a long, weird tube of meat that looked like...well, you get the picture). Turned out it was a shish kebab (ha!).

The owner and his wife (who are the chef and the waitress) are from Okinawa and Osaka respectively.  But the husband worked as a chef in Tokyo before he came to Chicago.  

I was only there for the sushi.  I didn&#39;t order anything from the cooked-food menu.  The fish was fresh, and the cut was just right, as well as the level of wasabi and vinegar in the rice.   The temperature of the fish was also perfect.  I would have preferred the temperature of the rice to be slightly warmer, but that&#39;s nit-picking at this point, especially given the price-level.  My sushi meal included ingredients such as chutoro, uni, and ikura, but I got out under $60 (including drinks, tax and tips!) and I was very full.  

This is the place to go if you want to have authentic Japanese sushi.   You won&#39;t find things like Dragon roll or Philadelphia roll on the menu.  Americanized maki are great, but that&#39;s just not what they do here.  

As a side note, I asked for negitoro, which was not on the menu, the chef made it for me because he had the ingredients.  Very nice and friendly guy.  I will definitely return!  If you are a sushi novice, just let the chef know - I&#39;m sure he will take good care of you."

Told it would be 50 minutes for delivery...and hour and 10 minutes in I call asking if they know when my food might arrive. He says he just left. Not good. Maybe a phone call would have been in order? So he says maybe 15 more minutes. Not happy. He&#39;s says they won&#39;t charge me. That&#39;s not the point. If it&#39;s going to take over an hour, be honest and tell me that! If they were honest about it, I would have been fine with that and happy to pay for my food.

We all ordered off of the lunch special, so we had good soup and crab rangoon. Our actual dishes came out really late though. Everyone&#39;s food was delicious, but next time we won&#39;t be going for lunch. We went over our hour break. We will have to go back for dinner."

This was my first time here and probably my last.  Service was mediocre, no one was overly friendly and the place was completely empty on a Sunday around 6pm.   We ordered the baby egg rolls, Thai fried rice with chicken, steak and pepper, and the Pad See Ewe with beef.  Overall the food was just meh, it lacked flavor and the beef was chewy and overcooked.  The baby egg rolls mainly just had ground chicken in them and they were supposed to be stuffed with chicken, shrimp, cabbage, and cellophane noodles.  Their prices are comparable to other Thai restaurants but the quality of food was disappointing."

We stopped in at CK Pad Thai on a rainy Friday night. It is located in a strip mall on Army Trail.

Came in, was greeted + seated and looked over the menu. Typical Thai menu items available. I always go with Green Curry with chicken which I can make a pretty good version of myself.
Also, Tom Yum soup as an item. I judge Thai restaurants on these two dishes. If they can&#39;t make these two basic Thai staples, they get crossed off my list.

The Tom Yum soup with shrimp was OK. Not the best I ever had but still enjoyable. The shrimp were fresh and tasty in the soup but the soup itself could have used more zip.
The Green Curry was very nice. The server asked about spice levels and I told him I like it spicy and it was. At first when eating it I did not think it was very spicy but upon continuing I felt the hair on the back of my head starting to sweat a bit. It creeped up on me and I loved it.

Overall, I give this place 4 stars. Nice and clean, friendly service and good curry. That&#39;s a 4 in my book.

Cheers to all"

We met the owner who was beyond friendly. He talked about Thailand and we shared we are planning a trip there. He told us to come back when it is closer because he will write many things down for us to do. So nice!

The service was extremely slow but friendly. 

We ordered the potstickers to start. We assumed they would be steamed, but instead they were fried. They were good and the sauce on the side was delicious.

I ordered the crazy noodle. It was extremely good with a good flavor. They menu says it is spicy, but I did not think the dish had much spice to it at all. 

My parents order the panang curry with chicken and the lemon chicken. The panang curry was flavorful and spicy. The lemon chicken was extremely lemony but did not have a great flavor. 

The meal was a little pricey for the size of the food we got. I would only come back because of how close it is to my house. Otherwise I would look elsewhere."

As I said, it all tasted rubbery and flavorless. We also got the lad nar noodles with chicken and it had no flavor expect for the bland soy sauce. The noodles were gummy and slimy and the chicken did not look chicken... So I did even bother to eat any of the chicken. I couldn&#39;t bare the taste so I spit it out of my mouth and threw it away.

It&#39;s a nicely decorated, clean, cozy place nestled in a strip mall with Piggly Wiggly and Dairy Queen. I didn&#39;t even know there were PW stores in Illinois. Guess that&#39;s another Carol Stream secret. 

We found it by searching the app for restaurants in close proximity to Costco because it was close to 9p and we were not traveling far during severe thunderstorms for food. 

We pulled in the lot and walked in and it was a ghost town. A waiter appeared to be dozing off.  And here I thought I was the only person who is tranced by the sound of rain. We wondered if the food would be that bad. But we sat and ordered anyway and are glad we did! It was 8:40p so we ordered quickly. I went traditional with Chicken Pad Thai and he had a coconut dish. He asked for beef but received chicken too (chuckles). Despite the mix up, it was great. Both were flavorful, saucy and the portions were generous. Our server, Tony was personable and attentive. He checked on us often and offered information about delivery and lunch specials. We were treated like we were the only ones in the room (and we were but it still felt nice!).


We will definitely circle back. Only next time, we can only hope to receive what we ordered. :-)"

I originally asked them if they had ground pork &amp; they said no but they did have ground chicken.. the next best thing. I asked for exxxtraa spicy ground chicken with basil.. simple as that with no rice.

To my peanut allergic friends,  this Is not the dish for you. This restaurant also serves bubble tea! I ordered the green tea bubble tea and it was delicious! 

 Portion sizes are more than sparing as well and pricing is decent and reasonable.  Parking is easily accessible as well.

It almost had a bit of a smokiness. Also, no peanuts. I&#39;d try the mild next time.

However, I loved the CK roll! An fusion of fresh spring rolls and sushi, filled with cream cheese, cucumber, avocado, bean sprouts, and egg, served with a large portion of sweet and spicy sauce. Good-sized portion for the price, too.

The mango sticky rice was a bummer: mango was not sweet, and kind of brown. The rice was hard.

There was another restaurant in the shopping center that we were hoping to check out but it was randomly closed.  Since anytime is the right time for Thai we decided to check out CK Pad Thai (after first seeing that it had good ratings through my Yelp app!).

There was only one other table occupied, but it was about 7 pm on a Sunday night so that is not really surprising.  Our waiter was super friendly and attentive.  I also liked how honest he was.  I was asked which was better and he answered &#34;definitely the crab rangoon no question&#34;.  Needless to say, we got an order of crab rangoon.  We also got Tom Yum soup since I have to have spicy soup whenever I go out for Thai food.  For my meal, I got the Pad See Ewe with beef.  All of the food definitely met my expectations.

The parking lot needs repaving and the whole strip mall seems kind of deserted.  But the inside of CK is really nice, warm colors, uncluttered/clean and decor minimal yet tasteful. 

There is seating for about 30-35 people and when we dined here for dinner midweek, the place was about half full, there was a steady stream of take out orders and the lone server was taking care of everybody.  He really should have been on roller skates because he just zipped all over the place and despite him being the lone server, service never suffered. 

The food was delicious. We tried the Crazy Noodles (wide noodles with veggies in a spicy sauce) Thai Fried Rice with Shrimp, Green Curry with Chicken and a plate of the Mini Egg Rolls. Everything was so well-made and tasty.  The spicy dishes had a nice heat, but the heat didn&#39;t overpower the flavor.  The Curry was really good and I&#39;m usually not a huge fan of Thai Curry.  The coconut milk in the curry was just enough to make it creamy and add sweetness without overpowering the curry flavor. My only gripe about the dishes was size of the veggies in the Crazy Noodles and Green Curry--the peppers and bamboo shoots were huge.  Could have used a little more chop down, but at least they were cooked perfectly and not overdone. The portions were a nice size and we had leftovers for lunch the next day. 

A great little spot for Thai.  Don&#39;t forget the Thai Iced Coffee--icy cold and refreshing!"

A decent Thai place just 10 minutes away from my suburban dwelling?  I rushed over with my husband.  Situated in a grungy looking strip mall, you&#39;ll find CK Pad Thai between a Dairy Queen and Asian Family Physician office.

Typical service from a Thai restaurant.  Fast.  Efficient.  Friendlier than most.  

Decor was clean, a Thai tapestry here and there.  Clean is key.

It be a 90 degree plus day, I need something to cool off, so Thai iced tea for me!  One of the best I&#39;ve had.  Not too sweet so that you can actually taste the tea.  Craving it now!  (Note to self-look up how to make Thai iced tea.  Probably pretty easy).

The food made me sad.  Sad because I think I might have to ditch my favorite Thai place in the burbs (Thai Zie-try it!) for CK.  

For $6.95 the lunch special includes a flavorful chicken rice broth soup &amp; not one but two shrimp egg rolls . You read that right, SHRIMP!  Not some puny vegetable egg roll! By the time the pad see ew I ordered came, I was one bite away from full.  Needless to say, I took more than half my lunch home.  Guess it&#39;s pad see ew for lunch at work tomorrow!

So you&#39;re at the end of your meal.  What&#39;s one of the frequently asked questions after we&#39;re all happy stuffed?  ...Anybody have gum? Yup, CK&#39;s got you covered! You&#39;ll find a stick of Wrigley gum with your  check."

The food at CK Pad Thai is most excellent compared to other restaurants. You would never suspect the quality of food from the strip-mall storefront. 

I ordered Panang Curry. The peppers were cooked just right, to where they were still crispy but not raw-crunchy. The tofu was not mushy and was fried around the edges to where the pieces had a nice tenderness. The curry itself was very flavorful, and they used just the right amount of spice!

The service was also very good. The waiter was friendly, personable, and attentive. We never had empty drinks, and he checked to make sure we were enjoying everything. I feel that service like this is hard to find amongst similiar restaurants.

The beauty of CK Pad Thai is its consistency. Everything is prepared almost exactly the same every time (please, there is no such thing as 100% exactitude with restaurants, but you can come close). Here are my conclusive results, after twice-monthly delivery service since August 2012:

- Pad thai: Insipid and watery
- Egg rolls: Unremarkable
- Chicken egg rolls: An astounding improvement ... no idea why. The sweet and sour sauce is awesome.
- Green curry with chicken: Flavorful and abundant with vegetables but too soupy. However, I have successfully remedied the texture by making a cornstarch slurry and stirring it into the curry while I reheat it.
- Panang curry with tofu: Same as above. 
- Beef and meatball noodle soup: The beef is too gristly so now I get it with just meatballs, those eerie and yummy spheres of beef paste and potato starch. I also request extra bean sprouts, basil and cilantro to make the whole dish resemble pho as closely as possible. 
- Chicken fried rice: Really delicious, maintaining that balance of sweet and salty so prevalent in Southeast Asian cuisine, and featuring big, tender chunks of gristle-free chicken breast. Whatever sauce they use, I want gallons of it.

Since I don&#39;t yet have a car, their delivery service is a godsend. Be sure to visit their website for coupons!!"

The actual restaurant is a little easy to miss. Tucked away in a strip mall, it seems quite underwhelming from the outside. Entering the restaurant, I was immediately greeted. The decor was cute and charming. The restaurant is on the small side, but that was okay as  we were the only patrons eating in. 

The food was fantastic. I ordered the green curry. I requested that it be extra spicy as I find that most Thai places go easy on us Americans. The curry was terrific. Very spicy as requested, but the right balance. I could still taste the amazing flavors of the coconut milk and fresh vegetables (eggplant, bamboo shoot, basil, etc.) I  was very pleased at how fresh the vegetables were!

My cousin ordered the spicy crazy noodle dish. Although I didn&#39;t have any, my cousin was raving about and has begging me to take him back for more. Did I mention, this was his first Thai experience? He loved it! His meal did look quite good!

So would I go there again? ABSOLUTELY! I actually can&#39;t wait. I would also and have already recommended it to friends! OH and also, the prices- SO CHEAP! Good Job CPK PAD THAI!"

The restaurant wasn&#39;t crowded, but we were looking for a more relaxed atmosphere.  We were greeted by a super friendly girl, who was also our waitress.  
We ordered the fresh spring rolls as our appetizers.  They were sooo good and they didn&#39;t skimp on how many they serve. For entrees, my husband ordered the spicy, basil chicken which was definitely spicy, but so tasty! I ordered the tofu pad thai, which was tasty, but lacked in spice.  
After reading a review on here earlier on the mango and sticky rice, I just had to try it and I&#39;m SOOO glad I did!  I don&#39;t like desserts that are too sweet, but the mango and rice perfectly complemented each other. My husband decided to try it too, even though he doesn&#39;t like mango and even he thought it was good.  I also love having gum after my meals and at places where they give you something, they usually give you a mint.  Here, they gave us 2 sticks of Wrigley gum!  That was the icing on the cake!  
We are so happy to have discovered this place, which we didn&#39;t know about until now.  We will definitely be back, whether we sit down or carry out!"

For the most part they are good and reasonably priced!  Look on their website for coupons for freebies!  I like them, not totally in love maybe because they don&#39;t have a consistent spicy system, like one to five ad have some sort of spicy associated with each number.  You just have to tell them you want it spicy and its up to their cooks discretion.   Sometimes very spicy can mean &#34;Oh my Gard I can&#39;t eat this its so hot! &#34; or &#34; honey did you tell them I wanted it spicy?&#34;   The food is tasty just wish &#34;spicy&#34; old mean the same thing every time."

We had the CK Fried Chicken with the yummiest sweet chili sauce. We also tried the Pad Si Ewe which was great, although the broccoli could have been a bit more tender as it was a little too crisp for my liking. We also had the Sampling Platter which comes with two of each chicken satays, egg rolls, pot stickers, crab rangoons and golden bags, and 3 dipping sauces, all of which were tasty. The crab rangoon didn&#39;t taste like it had any crab in it, though. Also, each item is a bit on the small side. I think I would have felt better if the platter was $8 instead of $10. The entree portions aren&#39;t huge like at some places, but more than adequate, and this is still my favorite Thai restaurant in the area."

Still, with recommendations from locals (and Jessica G.), I was hell-bent on getting some take-out.  I&#39;m glad I stuck with the adventure.

CK Pad Thai is small and not terribly noteworthy on the inside, but they whip up the food extremely quickly and the employees are friendly.  I ordered the Crazy Noodle extra spicy and they did quite a good job at this (even including an extra side of chili sauce... yay!).  The vegetables were so perfect -- red peppers still crisp, sweet onions still sweet.  It didn&#39;t quite rip my face off, but it wasn&#39;t the Minnesota-hot that I&#39;m used to getting stuck with back home.  The sauce itself was a bit on the greasy side but at least the food wasn&#39;t swimming in it.

My co-workers say they have fantastic lunch specials and visit often. The dinner prices (including my meal) are also very reasonable. But the proper cooking of the vegetables alone was worth twice what I paid."

The food here is decent, I didn&#39;t think the noodles were great, nor did it to be very authentic or impressive.  However, I should note that this has not kept me from going back.  This is sometimes where I bring people new to Thai food just so they can experience a few dishes for a reasonable price, granted they might like Thai food more if they go to a classier joint.

The service and environment are also average.  It&#39;s a small restaurant so you won&#39;t get the formal feel or ambiance to the restaurant; however, it is very clean and well kept.  Service is decent, though again, nothing noteworthy (in a good or bad fashion).

Overall, a decent place to visit with great price (hence the multiple returns).  Definitely consider it for take-out or a casual dinner midweek."

Thom Ka Kai soup was hot and not overly-heavy on the coconut milk, which I appreciated.  Pad Thai was standard; not the best I&#39;ve had, but far better than some.  Red curry was good.

The quality of the food here is quite high---portion sizes are large (expect to take left-overs), and the dishes just taste fresh and light and inspired. Their curries are thick and hearty and they use a high-grade variety of tofu. I also liked their stir-fry dishes which were fragrant and full of basil and chilis.

The decor is also well-done; very clean and homey, but nice enough that you could probably take a date here. You wouldn&#39;t expect something of this quality considering CK Pad Thai is in a grungy 1970s strip mall with a Jiffy Lube and a dentist.

Inexpensive mexican food is a huge plus at this location. I had the steak chimichanga which has ample amount of beef. The dinner comes with rice, beans, and some gauc/sour cream which usually cost more at other restaurants. Service is fast and made to order. You can order carry out to save on tips, but you miss out on the free salsa and chips. Overall a step up from Taco Bell.

Honestly, we find it rather hard to find a Mexican restaurant (take out) that uses fresh ingredients, and it always taste the same! You are never left wondering, umm, that was not as good as I originally thought. 

With that being said, we&#39;ve never been disappointed! Very large serving sizes. The tacos are filled to the top of the shell. Burritos are what we call &#34;super sized&#34;. Super tasty, loaded with meat of your choice and variety of toppings. 
Tamales are always very fresh and tasty. 
Loaded nachos are seriously loaded to the top of the box! So many toppings, you cannot even see the chips. Box weighs almost five pounds. I kid you not. 

We usually get take-out, but have stopped in to eat, and experienced the same wonderful service as we do when getting take-out. When eating in, you are served chips and two types of salsa. 
Average wait time for food is 10-15 mins (if that)
Menu has a very large selection, and priced just right. Especially for the amount of food you receive. 

Place is pretty clean, minus the &#34;occasional&#34; funky smell in between the outside door, and door leading into the restaurant.

I haven&#39;t been in the area long enough to know what this building was before TP, but I&#39;m speculating that it was a Taco Bell, right down to the booths.  I came in expecting to order at the counter, but I was told by an employee to have a seat and she would serve me.  Okay, cool.

I was greeted with chips, salsa, and a smile.  I decide to order the 3 taco dinner: I chose 3 different meats: chicken, beef, and pork.  The dinner also comes with beans, rice, and guacamole.  The chips and salsa were fresh and tasty, and assisted with my wait for my food (which was about 10 minutes).  I also enjoyed some silly Spanish-speaking soap opera on Univision.  I am not as fluent as I&#39;d like to be in Spanish, so most of the dialogue was lost on me.  I could only understand the doorbell ringing and someone&#39;s mother laughing.

The tacos were very good, with tender meat.  And also very filling.  I also ordered a cola (I forgot whether it was Pepsi or Coke) with my meal, and I neglected to ask about refills.  As such, I was charged for 2 drinks since I got 2 refills (you only get one refill for free).  So that was my boo-boo.

This is a nice place, with friendly people.  Even though I still have a favorite taqueria near me, I&#39;d come here for lunch/dinner if I&#39;m around this way.  It&#39;s pretty cool."

We&#39;re seriously considering finding another tacqueria as our latest experiences at Taco Patio have been disappointing, largely because of the inconsistency of the quality of the food. Sometimes the guacamole looks old and sometimes it&#39;s very sour. Sometimes the meat will be tender and sometimes it looks dry. Sometimes they put a lot of rice in the taco meal and sometimes there&#39;s barely any. I don&#39;t get it. 

About the only thing that is consistent is the staleness of the chips. Perhaps it&#39;s because they put the chips in the same container as the tacos, thus steaming the chips with the heat from the tacos. The chips should really come separately anyways. Nobody wants stale chips."

My friends and I just wanted something quickly that we could pick up and take to home to nosh on.  We went in on a Saturday night and we called in our order ahead of time and everything we ordered was warm, ready, tasty and CORRECT! And we had a lot of congested restrictions etc... They had really nice portions and everything looked and tasted fresh and of course better than your typical Americanized Mexican joint. The prices were pretty good as well. We got a mixture of chips and salsas to nachos  and a lot of stuff in between. 

The only issue I had is the little waiting ordering area is tiny and tight especially when there are a lot of people ordering or waiting for their orders. But after you partake in the yummy goodness that kind of goes to the wayside....

Come and get your taco on you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

The GPS (Love Her, Hate Her, but still better than than the days of printing out maps and pulling over to boot the slow laptop and fire up the map program) listed Taco Patio so I said why not?

Very clean, excellent service. I got a carne asada taco and chips and salsa. The chips were very good, not greasy at all and I really liked the salsa. I didn&#39;t care at all for the red and green sauce in the bottles.

The taco was good, not spectacular, but very big for a single taco, with two corn tortillas - I ended up only eating around half with the fork that was thoughtfully provided.

Again, nothing really spectacular but very clean and excellent service."

Also tried one of their churros, which ended up being a bit dry but it did have flavor.  I still have my favorite joints but if I&#39;m in the area, Taco Patio it is!"

I ordered a dinner set that included a taco, quesadilla, and tamale.
Taco was stuffed with a generous amount of well marinated pastor.  The quesadilla, although tasty, was kinda a lazy version.  It was literally just cheese melted between two tortillas.  It didn&#39;t have that crispy exterior one comes to expect form a quesadilla.  I generally don&#39;t like tamales; but this is definitely one of the better ones I&#39;ve ever eaten. 

The order can with a small cup of guac, and generous amounts of salsa.  Unfortunately they only had &#34;green&#39; salsa.  I tend to like &#34;red&#34; more.  Sorry, I know those aren&#39;t the official names; but you know what I mean.  

The place is good, cheap, and rather clean as well.  I&#39;ll def be back for more.

Was around 10 pm on a Friday night and every place is closed...what is the deal with suburban eateries closing so early? Don&#39;t people eat after 9 pm? Anyways, Taco Patio was open and I was wanting a taco so it seemed like a match made in heaven.

Got 2 orders of taco meals to go. Both were chicken, mine was with cilantro and onion and my boyfriends had cheese, lettuce and tomato. The meal also came with rice &amp; beans and a small drink.

Honestly, I&#39;ve had better. I was really hoping for nice, flavorful and juicy pieces of chicken. The chicken was pretty dry and didn&#39;t have any memorable flavor. The rice seemed a bit dry too. Again, it was late at night and I was starving so it really didn&#39;t bother me. My bf mentioned that they must have had an off night because he&#39;s eaten there before and said it was much better before.

I guess if I am craving a taco at 10 pm, I will head back.

Anyway, we first stopped at jc&#39;s in Bartlett to find them closed.  Then we went to villaggios in roselle... To also find them closed.  At this point we were hungry and cranky so we headed to spavones. At least they were open!


The decor reminded me of an 1980&#39;s banquet hall. There was a decent crowd, but a banquet was also going on in the next room. 

Our waitress seemed frazzled.  Most questions we asked were answered with an I don&#39;t know.  My husband asked what the widest noodle he could get and she literally had no clue.  Hmm...

So we ordered our entrees, and two drinks. I was happy with my gluten free pasta, but it wasn&#39;t anything special. I guess for the 19.95 price tag, I was hoping to at least get a salad.  Nothing came with the meals except bread rolls.  They smelled delicious and it stank sitting there with my mouth salvating while my other two family members ate. 

Overall, the meal was fine. Nothing special though. I would love if they threw in a salad or soup with the meal. I would be more willing to go back.  But an 80 dollar bill before tip seemed like an awful lot to me."

I feel like I would have gotten I trouble here as a kid for playing by the fireplace or pulling on the tablecloths. It has an old time, family feel to the place. I know in other reviews Yelpers say its outdated, but I think it&#39;s a nice welcome of something different. I dined on a Thursday night and the place was basically dead, which concerned me until I got my food. The only down side was that I don&#39;t drink or eat items cooked with alcohol,  and virtually everything on the menu had wine of some sort in it so I had to order wisely. 
Everything we ordered was extremely fresh and authentic. I had a filet, and my boyfriend had some crazy trio of things I could not pronounce. Everything was simply delicious. My filet was cooked perfectly, and the lemon butter sauce it came with was awesome. 
.Tony himself was there and very sweet as well. I really enjoyed my visit here and step back into another time."

The interior looks outdated and a little run down. Looks aren&#39;t everything, but it didn&#39;t feel very inviting. Unfortunately, both bathroom stalls were dirty, (details here will be spared), which was quite unpleasant.

Our waiter was sarcastic and made comments that were inappropriate. I understand he may have been trying to be funny, but using a condescending tone and making personal comments towards customers is neither funny nor acceptable. I won&#39;t elaborate on the remarks to save the tedium of reading a long review.

The food was ok. Grilled calamari lacked flavor, and all the food seemed to take quite a long time considering the small number of guests. The gravy on the veal reminded me of cafeteria gravy. I feel like the price was not at all relative to the quality (food and service) and flavor.

Positives- the bread served was good (as silly as that is to include). The veal itself without the gravy was tasty. Also, our bus boy was pleasant and attentive. 

My last note was that I worked in a restaurant for years...this is not a place I&#39;d return to."

Restaurant is severely outdated.  They have a disco ball on the ceiling that is covered with dust.  Their wall paper is torn and taped back on the wall

Their dinner rolls have way to much garlic on them. I love garlic, but those were not eatable.  The meal was family style.  Fish was good, pasta was good, but the chicken was raw.  How can a restaurant serve raw chicken?  Cooking 101

Tony did a few songs and has a great voice.  I&#39;d close after the holidays and revamp the decor and menu.  It&#39;s time."

This is a dying breed, so if you get a chance get here on a Friday or Saturday night and you will not only have a great meal, but Tony will sing you some great Italian favorites. Great atmosphere.  Make sure you make a reservation because the place is busy on weekends. 

This menu hasn&#39;t changed since the 1980&#39;s because it is solid southern Italian food. The veal dishes are amazing, the Chicken Parm is worth the trip and Braciole is also great. My only negative comment is that sometimes garlic takes over some dishes. The house salad dressing is an example and so are the garlic rolls that start the meal. Oh well, they are garlic rolls. 

Service is good but could improve. Wait staff sometimes is a bit hurried and not as attentive as they should be. The decor is a bit weathered but adds to the experience. This should not be a reason to miss this place."

My bf called me and told me that they were going to have the music group &#34;The Drifters&#34; at this place the following week... I called up the restaurant and they told me thet they were booked so I went on OpenTable and was able to score a reservation there. 
I called twice to confirm my reservation and the gentleman that answered told me that he would try very hard to get me into the room with the concert. (he DID come through).. 
We sat to eat and we didn&#39;t know about the dinner package that came along with the evening. It was $55 per person and a limited menu. Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t like anything on it. 
We did order a bottle of wine and a full dinner but was told by the waitress that we would be charged an additional $25 per person to view the concert. Since we were ordering a full dinner, I thought that was ridiculous but we were already there...
Bread was ok.. WAY too garlic and I LOVE garlic... 
Pasta dishes we both had were of average quality. 
They didn&#39;t have two of the original bottles of wine we ordered... 
I am not sure if I would try it here again. 
I will say... average food... very good waitress... accommodating with the reservation and a little miffed about this dinner package...

The bartender was friendly, attentive and poured a good drink.  We were seated at our reservation time.  

The meals we ordered included a veal dish, shrimp scampi and spaghetti with clams.  All partys stated they enjoyed their meals.  Service was excellent.

Overall pricing for the meal was good.  The singing owner, I could take or leave, but it appears that many in the restaurant look forward to his entertainment.

I definitely will return."

We enjoyed an early Saturday dinner with friends and felt like we were at a celebration.  There were two large parties celebrating birthdays and 80% of the tables were full by the time we left at 7:30.  Tony made everyone feel at home with his charm and his old Italian songs.

The food was great!  We shared appetizers of bruschetta and arincini which everyone loved.  I ordered the Meditereanean Sea Bass which was a special offering.  The fish was as good as any grilled fish I have had at Shaw&#39;s.  A whole grilled fish that was perfectly deboned table side by Kelly.   

My wife ordered the pasta with broccoli and shrimp which was prepared in an olio sauce.  She loved it.  They have a pretty good wine list that includes some interesting wines.  We didn&#39;t have any room for dessert because the portions are so large and it&#39;s hard to have just one.

Our server, Kelly was fantastic.  She was very professional and attentive.  Everything about Spavone&#39;s was spot on.  Food, service and atmosphere - we walked out with smiles on our faces.

The only question I have is, &#34;Why did it take us so long to visit Spavone&#39;s?&#34;  We love this place!"

As many other reviews have stated, the atmosphere is dated and boring, and the lighting is too bright and glaring.  We were seated right away for our 6:45 reservation and greeted promptly by our waitress, Nicole, who took our drink order, a bottle of wine that was on their list.  She came back and said they &#34;don&#39;t carry&#34; that wine, which forced us to choose another.  After the wine was poured, we sat for at least 45 minutes, waiting to give our food order.  I had to go ask the hostess to PLEASE send our server over, since no amount of arm waving could get her attention.  After finally ordering, we waited another 1/2 hour for the food to arrive...please!  how long does pasta take?  All three of our dinners were below average.  The prawn special came on top of spaghetti noodles with an enormous amount of raw garlic sliced all over it, yet surprisingly, had very little flavor.  The appetizer special which was ordered as an entree, had fried calamari (gummy batter was falling off the squid), some kind of weird tasting shrimp swimming in an unpleasant sauce, lots of roasted red peppers, olives, capers, stuffed rolled eggplant (if I didn&#39;t read it on the menu I wouldn&#39;t have known what it was).  Tony came over once to apologize for the long delays (the restaurant was busy, but c&#39;mon, when you&#39;ve been in business for over 30 years you should know how to handle a Sat night) Tony should be more attentive to his customers than he is to his lounge act."

My husband introduced me to this place a couple years ago and the family we went with has been coming here since they opened.


Tony was nice enough to come to our table and chat with our family and talk about how my husband and his family have been coming here since they opened. Tony was singing Christmas songs and asked me if I had a favorite Christmas movie. Tony as well as my entire family laughed when I said ask the Jewish girl her favorite Christmas movie (I married into an Italian family). 

Our server was kind of weird and spoke in a very monotone voice but she did come up with great food. recommendations including ordering tiramisu with cannoli filling on the bottom.

Each time I come here I order something different and have to say they nothing I order here is bad. We ordered two appetizers to share of the calamari (I don&#39;t eat that) and their delicious bruschetta. The  bread is amazing and comes out warm with fresh garlic. The minestrone soup was delicious. I decided to order for my main course the chicken Parmesan. The portion size was huge with two giant chicken breasts. It was warm and delicious with the perfect amount of breading. cheese and sauce. I was so full I couldn&#39;t  even get to my side dish of angel hair pasta in meat sauce. I took the pasta home with me that is a portion large enough to have as a dinner the next night.  I had a bite of my husband&#39;s chicken Marsala and that tasted delicious as well. Everyone else at my table ordered the chicken Vesuvio which looked amazing. I&#39;ll have  to try that next time we dine here. Their tiramisu is the best I have had from any Italian restaurant. The husband and I shared it.

I would also like to say don&#39;t expect to be in and out of this restaurant fast. If you want five star authentic Italian dining you come here if not then I encourage you to go to a local &#34;chain&#34; Italian restaurant. The food is made fresh and hot. I can&#39;t wait to come back here again to try their chicken Vesuvio. I can understand why my husband&#39;s family have been coming here for over 30 years. It is simply the best!!!!"

It was a Saturday evening at around 6pm and they were slammed! We had to wait 15 minutes.  I don&#39;t usually drive past it but when I would the parking lot would always be nearly empty, so I was shocked to see this much business.  

I believe several changes had been made to the food, ambiance and restaurant and it is now back to what it used to be.  Yes, I will say, for a suburban Italian restaurant it is a little pricey! BUT, I will also say that you will not find a better vodka sauce at any suburban Italian restaurants.  Everything is made to order, so you could expect your dinner to be around 2 hours or so.  

They start you off with garlic-butter rolls, delish! The baked clam appetizers were very good and our calamari was crispy and tender on the inside.  Our cocktails were strong, bonus points to the bartender.  I asked for my chicken parmagiana to come with vodka sauce and the waiter had no problem making the substitution.  The rest of our party enjoyed their meals, especially my dad and his veal dish.

The service was good, but a little spotty, I couldn&#39;t tell who our server was because a couple people kept switching off.  At any rate, the service was fine and fulfilled it&#39;s purpose. 

It&#39;s also dinner AND entertainment: Tony Spavone sings and takes requests!
My dad is a Taylor Street Italian and loves to hear his &#34;Mob Hits&#34; and Tony kept his favorites coming!  That&#39;s amore? Yeah.  I can&#39;t comment on much of their menu, but I do recommend the calamari appetizer and the parmigiana dishes."

First off, I want to say that I really wanted to like this place - I like supporting local businesses, instead of the chains..but, it was, by far the worst dining experience I have ever had..first off, the service was unbelievably slow...we sat down and then waited 45 minutes before the waiter took our drink order...he seemed a bit overwhelmed, and explained that he was new, so we told him we understood...then, it was another 30 minutes before he could take our appetizer order...the appetizers were mediocre, at best..nothing special.  About 30 minutes after we ordered our entrees, they finally arrived..three of us had ordered the gnocchi with Vodka Sauce, and it was not good at all..the sauce was very thick and an odd orange color, which prompted my friend to ask if it was Kraft macaroni and cheese.  The waiter continued to be frazzled, even after the room started to empty out...we tried to be patient, but when we ordered our desserts and coffee, and after 20 minutes still did not have them, I asked for the manager.  I explained what had happened and that I was very disappointed in the evening..he seemed surprised by my assessment, and said that the Vodka Sauce was very good, even after three of us had just told him it was not..I thought I was in the Twilight Zone at that point...I asked for the check and we canceled the desserts, since there was no indication they would be coming to our table any time in the near future...the manager kept asking that we come back another time when it wasn&#39;t so busy and it would be better...not sure how that could be guaranteed, since the food was not good...were they going to get the food from Olive Garden for my next visit?  But, he tried to make things right by comping the Kraft gnocchi and cheese, and gave me a gift certificate for a very generous amount, but even with that, I will not go back.  Then, the waiter actually came over to our table, and asked why we canceled our desserts!  Seriously?  

I went home and had leftover pizza, which was a better meal.  Having read the rave reviews here, I can only say that this must be the most schizophrenic dining establishment in all the Western Suburbs...the reviews here go from out of this world to what in the world?...that level of inconsistency is unacceptable in a restaurant"

A seafood fettuccine comes with minestrone soup and garlic roll.   The garlic roll was OK, I quite like it. The soup was so-so. No problem cause i care more about main course.  The pasta, OMG, HUGE PROBLEM. It&#39;s way too much sauce first of all, whole pasta was dipping in the white sauce, every single pasta has more than enough cheese/sauce sticking on it. I was like drinking a bottle of pasta sauce. More doesnt mean it would taste well. There were scallop and shrimp on top of the pasta, let me tell you, those were the worst shrimp and scallop I have ever had in my whole life. Seriously. They were hard as stones, not sure were they overcooked or what... I can easily find frozen shrimp and scallop in any grocery store that would taste way better.

I bookmarked this place a while ago, always looking for a time to stop by based on decent reviews on here.  I had the bookmark removed today, there is no way a chef can destroy a dish like that."

As for the food, it&#39;s the real deal. I can&#39;t recommend just one thing because anything I&#39;ve ever ordered has been completely satisfying.

I ordered the ravioli and it was pretty tasty.  The sauce was definitely homemade.  I scrapped what was left on my plate with on of their delicious rolls.  I ate FOUR of them...lol

Tony singing to his customers was a nice touch.  Almost maks one feel like they&#39;re at a family party.  Our waiter was a very funny older gentleman that managed to make all of us laugh everytime he came to our table.

Wooo) and didn&#39;t really enjoy it. So, when we turned into the parking lot -- and this was the &#34;really great Italian place&#34; my parents had been raving about for months but couldn&#39;t remember the name of -- I was a bit stunned, to say the least.

Feeding my mom is more difficult than giving a kid veggies, so I figured things had changed.

I scanned the menu for a long time, flipped pages back and forth, but couldn&#39;t find a damned thing to order. Nothing really did it for me. I absolutely hate ordering pasta at restaurants because it&#39;s (mostly) overpriced stuff that I could make 10x better at home, and that&#39;s what comprises 90% of the entrees. Our waiter offered to make a plain grilled chicken for me with some vegg and potatoes, and it was just okay.

My parents seemed to enjoy their meals, but you couldn&#39;t pay me to go back here. I simply have no need to.

Oh, and the singing... Oh, my. Haha. Be ready for that! You won&#39;t hear a word anyone at your table says, but you&#39;ll be serenaded til your ear drums pop."

We&#39;ll never do that again...

We went on a Thursday night around 7:30, and the place was deserted. Upon walking in you first notice the giant wall with Tony posing with various celebrities over the years, very neat. We were warmly greeted and seated promptly. On the plus side, the service was very good; Kelly was great. The rolls included with the dinner were warm and tasty. We decided on an appetizer with dinner, and we weren&#39;t disappointed with the fried calamari. After that, everything went downhill quickly.

I ordered the Veal Siciliana, a layered veal and eggplant dish smothered in meat sauce, and a side of angel hair and meat sauce. The veal was a super-thin slice of meat, heavily breaded, reminding me of something out of a school cafeteria. The meat sauce was relatively tasteless, and the sin of all Italian food sins: the pasta was overcooked and mushy! The meal came with a choice of soup or salad. I chose the Minestrone soup and was taken aback by the excess salt. I would have rather eaten a can of Progresso, cold, served in the can...

My partner ordered the Chicken Cardinale, and having tried it myself, the dish was all around bland. It was basically a piece of breaded chicken, cheese, and tomato sauce (which tasted like it came out of a can.) He ordered the Pasta e fagiole soup, which was mostly beans, and the beans tasted like the cook opened a can of &#39;pork n&#39; beans&#39; and added that to their broth.

While Tony himself was friendly, and the service nice, the food left much to be desired. It looked to me like they&#39;re riding on reputation. A major improvement is needed in the kitchen before I make a return visit."

Everything from the service to the food and everything else in between was AWFUL!!!!  I can&#39;t believe how many people give it 5 stars?  What on earth?!  This was our second time at Tony&#39;s.. first time was bad... second time was so terrible - I have to warn people about it.  It took us 2 and a half hours to get our dinner.  Yes.. I&#39;m serious!!!  And they were unapologetic about it. It took probably a half hour before we got our first round of drinks, then another 45 minutes to get the second.  45 minutes!!!  It wasn&#39;t until we said something to the hostess, until the waiter came over.  They were out of many things, I had to change my entire order, half the people at the table didn&#39;t get the pasta fagiole (special) that they ordered.. and when they brought out someone&#39;s steak and three small potato wedges instead of the baked potato he had ordered, they said &#34;Sorry sir, we&#39;ll bring more out later&#34;.. which they never did.  Food was mediocre, at BEST.  Mediocre is actually a compliment for that food.   Our waters were never once refilled, or offered desert, the list goes on.     
Tony actually said &#34;I&#39;m sorry.. could I sing you a song to make it up to?&#34; (which he never did).  and offered to buy us a last round of drinks.  Okay!  why not.. So, we all order our drinks and get our bills.. and we were all billed for our last round!  When we told the waiter, he made it seem (didn&#39;t speak english well) like he couldn&#39;t do anything about it.

I can say those reviewers were wrong. I&#39;m not an old timer and I had a great time and an excellent meal at Tonys. I would come back again and again. Everything was perfect from start to finish. I wanted something not on the menu and they were able to accommodate. The rest of my party all enjoyed their meals as well. The Calamari was very good too. It&#39;s a nice place and has a very nice ambiance to it as well. The reviewer saying only old timers would enjoy this pace probably thinks the best Italian food is at a mass chain like the Olive Garden.... Lol. To each their own.

This place has authentic Italian food and a very family oriented atmosphere.  Food is priced very reasonably. 

Some of my favorites: 
The garlic rolls (are to die for!)
Real homemade tasting calamari (not the pre-made junk you get everywhere)
The Vodka sauce (omg this is amazing on pretty much every pasta dish)
The gnocchi (especially with the vodka sauce)
The veal (best veal I have ever had at a restaurant- especially the lemon or parm)
The Specials [this place never fails to bring out new specials that make you want to try every single one!]
Tiramisu (regardless if you have room left in your stomach, you have to get this!)

Very quiet atmosphere for lunch
For dinner:  its as is you were invited to a big Italian family party.

If you want to come her for a holiday:  you need to make reservations at least two weeks in advance and remember this place is packed to the brim so don&#39;t expect to get out of here in less than 2 hours.

I had been there in the past for other family gatherings and was always pleased with the food.  Its a restaurant and not a banquet hall or &#34;country club&#34; posing as a banquet hall which was a selling point for my future Mother-In-Law. Spavone&#39;s food does not and did not disappoint our picky italian invitees.  The ambience was also perfect.   It was a lot less &#34;shower&#34; and much more &#34;Sunday dinner&#34; which we both loved. 

From what I hear they were extremely accommodating with everything in the planning aspects from the food menu to the space (we needed more room and they were able to section off the majority of the restaurant for the afternoon).  They allowed the hosts to bring homemade cookies/cannoli and lots of them! They were also able to switch out linens which really made things come together.

The menu consisted of salad, minestrone, bread, Italian style green beans,  pasta with vodka sauce, chicken vesuvio and lemon ice.  The majority of family/friends on my fiancé&#39;s side had been there before but my family had not and raved about how fabulous the food was.  Also, so much food and they do offer &#34;to go&#34; boxes.  They also offered them for the cake and  cookie table, which I thought was nice.

The food and service were fabulous!  Way to go Spavone&#39;s.  Definitely a beautiful memory in my book!"

Food was excellent - however, waitstaff was lacking severely.  When you have to ask 3 times for an Ice Tea, and finally ask another waiter than your own - it&#39;s not a good sign.  

I appreciated Tony&#39;s signing, and overall it was very nice.  But, if I don&#39;t have good waitstaff, chances are I&#39;m done with the place."

What a wonderful place to enjoy a meal with family and friends. You are greeted by Tony or his wife with a smile and a genuine expression of happiness that you have arrived! Tony is one of those men that make you feel as if you are his family and you are a VIP! He and his family (actual family and staff,) are warm and accommodating. There is &#34;no problem,&#34; if you require something different or special. Now comes the fun part: Mr. Tony Spavone singing to you and entertaining his &#34;family.&#34; He sings like a dream and feels every word of what he&#39;s expressing. He&#39;s having a ball and so are you. The food is excellent: authentic Italian food! No shortcuts here (his Mom and Dad probably would not have allowed that!) the menu has something for everyone along with beverages and dessert to compliment a Five Star meal. So, if you want to go to a warm, beautiful location with knock out food and superb entertainment, Spavone&#39;s is the place. Let Tony sing to you and your family then serve you mouth watering Italian fare. Oh, and if you have an event and would like to have this experience in private, Tony has a wonderful banquet room for your event. He&#39;ll even come in and sing a few tunes for you to mark the occasion and make it just a bit more special. I hope you take time to visit Bloomingdale Il and experience Spavone&#39;s. You&#39;ll have a memorable time."

I have lived in the area for over 20 years and had never been here, what a mistake. Had the Rotolo Vodka and would say this was the best vodka sauce I have ever had. Do not come in here for a quick dinner cause you will be here for awhile. The owner Tony loves to sing and if you are lucky you will hear  the waitress Callie sing, what an amazing voice.

I heard a &#34; moo &#34; as the server laid the plate down. Sent it back and asked them to please kill and cook the cow. Came back as tough as the soles on my old Army combat boots. Pasta was egg noodles with watered-down ketchup. String with Ragu sauce would&#39;ve been tastier. Chicken was as dry as a small town after a million dollar cocaine bust. Amazed that people pay up to twenty bucks a plate for such garbage. The bus boy asked me if I was done eating and I said probably for life. I turned down the doggie bag because my pooch would&#39;ve been insulted if I actually tried to feed him that overpriced, overcooked, unappetizing drek. On the bright side, the water was good. I rated the food and overall experience with one star only because there is no lower rating to describe such a disappointing evening.

Mind you, I have been in the food industry for 6+ years. Ordered the rice ball appetizer, they came out still frozen. Sent them back, still cold in the middle. Thought, okay, they were busy I get it.  After and hour and a half the entrées come out. Mine and my boy friends moms entrée were cold in the middle. Sent thrm back,  came  back cold AGAIN. At this point im like wtf. I told the owner I woukd eat it because after over an hour and a half im starving, so I would eat the cold pasta. The taste was good I will say, same with the appetizers. The waiter was the worst. Very tall guy, cant remember his name. Never apologized, never asked us if we need anything, never refilled drinks, nothinnnggg. I dont usually complain,  but for being higher priced it was inexcusable.  I understand, it was busy, i understand shit happens. But to ignore us and it continue to be wrong, come on. We will NEVER be back. Also, the owners singing was like some kind of weird vegas review and made me uncomfortable.  A waitress sang who was very good.  Overall a terrible experience.  They ended up comping us 4 desserts, 2 drinks, and the 2 entrées. Should have comped the whole bill to ensure a return cisit.  Had the food been cooked, the waiter been competent,  and the owner not sang? I would recommend it lol very surprised an established, renown resturant had such a big mishap tonight. Also, everything is frozen and reheated. Nothing was mase fresh. Sooooo disappointing."

If you like to hear a below average karaoke singer then this place is for you. We didn&#39;t care for it and enjoyed the 45 minutes he took off. The service was poor, we waited a half hour before our waitress acknowledged us and another 15 -20 minutes before we got bread and drinks. This continued and we were late for our evening plans. I would have understood if the place was packed but it wasn&#39;t and she only had 4 tables mot of which were 2 tops. 

The food was good when we finally got it but my brocole was less then luke warm but my manocotti was piping hot. My wife had the seafood risotto which was very good. The serving sizes were bigger than needed, I saw many people walking out with doggie bags. 

I probably wouldn&#39;t be back mostly because of the loud, bad singing."

Also took home the homemade tiramisu and cannoli. Both of which I will pass on next time. Way over priced dessert and neither were very good. Olive Garden still has the best Tiramisu.

The food was great, from the rolls all the way to the dessert.  I usually will order veal when eating Italian, and I can assure you I&#39;ve had veal at many Italian restaurants in Chicago.  Spavone&#39;s veal was probably the best veal I have ever had.  I am not exaggerating, it was that good!   Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meal, with no complaints whatsoever.   If anything, everyone else loved everything as much as I did.   I would recommend Spavone&#39;s to anyone who wants to enjoy a fantastic meal at a reasonable price.

I would&#39;ve given Spavone&#39;s four stars had they not been rude about their mistake because I&#39;ve been coming here for as long as I can recall.
Spavone&#39;s is a place that my family and I have frequented for a long time.  There&#39;s something really authentic about it..no frills, just traditional food and a lobby area littered with pictures of..idk I think Tony and Jim McMahon and other Chicagoland icons.
Unfortunately, most of our trips are after services at the nearby Salerno&#39;s funeral home.  Anyhow, the food is decent.  It&#39;s not the best Italian food I&#39;ve had, but the atmosphere is authentic and you can be sure to leave in a carb induced coma.  I think what I&#39;ve enjoyed most over the years is the consistency.  You know what to expect, Tony Spavone on the mic, pleasuring your eardrums with a little ditty.  It&#39;s actually hilarious.  
Also, the food is consistently good.  The Rotolo Primavera, is tasty, rich and fattening (although Zaza&#39;s in STC is better, sorry Tone).  The eggplant is also pretty decent (although V&amp;V in Bartlett is where it&#39;s at).  Their rolls are pretty damn delish though (but they&#39;re trumped by the Hideaway&#39;s).  Point being, everything here is good, but not the best.  
Overall, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back here one day but I&#39;m not making the trek from STC to Roselle for Tony&#39;s singing."

The wait staff was very attentive: more so than most restaurants.  My pasta e fagioli soup was &#34;perfetto&#34;, and so was my chicken marsala. The latter was comparable to something one might find while actually dining in Italy! 

 But let&#39;s talk about the SINGIN&#39;! Ah, Tony...bless your heart! You&#39;ve got quite the repertoire. Highlight of the evening was when he prefaced &#34;Beyond the Sea&#34; with &#34; ..and now I&#39;d like to sing a song from &#39;Finding Nimmo&#39; &#34;.  The table full of Liz Taylor clones right next to us ate that up.  Let&#39;s just say that the singing was more about the presentation rather than the actual substance.

I often wish it was closer. The last visit up there I tried the escarole and bean soup for the first time, recommended to me by our waiter, and I was a fan right away. My favorite dish is the Fettuccine Carbonara, much better than what I can get at the local Olive Garden. A must for me is to get olive oil and parmesan cheese, mix it together on a little plate and dip the rolls into the mixture.

They also have the only tiramisu I have ever liked, but that probably had something to do with the amount of brandy in it. I&#39;m not a big fan of coffee, but the brandy makes it all the better.

I also love the atmosphere there. Nights when Tony entertains are great. Once I was there and ended up in a conga line."

The Chicken Vesuvio was cooked just right with the Vesuvio potatoes.  I had the Minestone soup which I am not a minestrone soup lover but this was something I liked.  I went during lunch so it was pretty quiet.  Tony had come in while I was eating and had sat across from me and we had talked for a few minutes during my meal.  Nice to see the owner out on the floor.  The garlic rolls were also very good.  The price for the lunch was reasonable and I was able to actually take some home because I could not eat everything.

My husband and I went there for our 1 year anniversary.  The waiter was extrememly attentive.  We used a $25 Restaurant.com gift certificate.  After seeing mixed reviews on Yelp, I was a bit skeptical, but knew it was a place my husband would probably like.  I was right!  I liked it too.  The decor was a bit dated, but nice regardless.  I don&#39;t expect every restaurant I walked in to to look like they just remodeled or just opened up.  It shows character, and I know that they must have been there for a while.  There were tons of pictures on the walls of Tony and his family.  I know it is definitely a family owned and family orientated restaurant, and I like that.  It&#39;s not the best place for kids, as there is nothing for them to do there but eat, but they are willing to half portions of their pastas, and accommodate a child.  We did not bring kids, but did inquire.  Tony sings there every night around 6:30 or 7:00.  I am sorry that we went as early as we did, because we missed Tony.  We will definitely be going back to eat again and hear Tony! 
Back to the waiter - very attentive, but not overly attentive.  He knew we wanted to enjoy our meal, and not be rushed.  We ordered shrimp cocktail - no fishy smell at all.  They were very fresh shrimp.  Then we went out for a smoke, and had our 2nd round of cocktails waiting for us when we got back in.  We ordered dinner, the salads came, and we ate those.  The waited informed us that we had time to sneak in one more smoke before dinner came.  I loved that he told us that, so we went for another smoke!  We came in and had dinner, and enjoyed every bit of it.  I have been looking for a mushroom risotto that was good, and they had it!  After dinner the waiter asked if we would like dessert, but declined and opted for another cocktail.  He gave them to us on the house for an anniversary gift.  I thought that was very cool.  We got out of there for $75 plus tip including the restaurant.com certificate.  I will definitely return for more. Buonissimo!"

Their chicken vesuvio is pretty darn good too.   They also have live entertainment on the weekend nights. I personally enjoy listening to Tony Spavone sing.  The other night he had a wonderful violin and piano duo playing relaxing music through out the evening .  best of all his prices are respectable.  My only criticism is that the decor is pretty old.

The things I like about this little place: healthier lunch options, friendly staff, and fresh ingredients.

Why I&#39;m giving SS 3 stars: the very first time I ordered a salad here, it was absolutely swimming in dressing...kind of like, &#34;Would you like some salad with your dressing?&#34; But OK, that is an easy enough fix -- now I am just always sure to ask for dressing on the side.

However, my main complaint is that every time I order a salad (and I&#39;ve tried a few different kinds) the salad always comes as 98% lettuce and very few other ingredients that are listed in the description of that particular salad on the menu. I always feel a little disappointed and like I just paid $8 for a huge bowl of spinach or romaine leaves. 

I just had lunch with my husband here the other day and thought I&#39;d give the Southwestern salad a shot. I think I counted approximately 6 pieces of avocado in the full size salad, a few kernels of corn &amp; pieces of cucumber -- and I don&#39;t even remember seeing any jicama or tortilla strips. 

I have never tried the paninis, so maybe I will give them a shot."

My husband and I stopped by here one rainy night after his chiropractor session nearby and were kind of blown away by how unexpectedly cute and cozy Savory Salads was. Nice small tables, basic decor, very friendly employees, a small outdoor dining area for warmer days, and a mouth-watering menu. After staring at the menu forever and figuring out exactly what we wanted, we ordered a couple paninis with chips and salads. And I got a coffee; Intelligentsia, baby!

The paninis are HUGE.

So huge, in fact, that I could only eat half of my panini and had to save the other half PLUS my chips for lunch the next day. And it was still amazing! So satisfyingly scrumptous. Savory, indeed.

Also, their paninis are the reason that my husband and I decided we needed to get a panini-maker and make some awesome food at home (and I may or may not have bought one earlier today instead of waiting for Christmas..... oops?!).

The only thing this place has against them is the location. It&#39;s very easy to miss when you&#39;re driving by during rush hour traffic and all you see is a glimpse of the bright Subway sign next door (DO NOT go to Subway -- pay the extra couple bucks for the much better fare at Savory Salads). If it were downtown, it might get more attention. Or maybe not. Maybe this is just where Savory Salads needs to be.

Nom nom nom."

This joint is what you get when you mix Mike Tyson and powerful, packed-to-the-point paninis. These babys will know you on your ass. 

I don&#39;t typically even think of salads and paninis, but when I do I usually think of delicate women or ladies who lunch. Most of you reading this probably don&#39;t know me, but I&#39;ve never been called delicate in my life- I came out of the womb a hardened, hungry hellion and I plan on staying that way. Before Savory Salads, you wouldn&#39;t find me within 50 yards of a salad during dinner time, but I got a tip from a fellow yelper that SS served hearty greens and paninis as big as your head, and decided to give it a shot. 

The first time we went, we passed it right up. Easy to miss, situated next to a Subway, you&#39;re doing yourself a great disservice partaking in a sad $5 foot long. For a only a very nominal bit more, you can get a larger, more filling and fulfilling meal at Savory Salads. Everything was hearty, the bread was delicious and even the half salad was jam packed into a container making it enough for 2 to share- same story with the half panini. 

I&#39;ve left buffets less full than Savory Salads. They mean business here, but their business ain&#39;t mean. Definitely some of the friendliest service I&#39;ve encountered. The dining area is very very small, so on a busy lunch time frame you may be better off just ordering to go. On our visit I think we&#39;d just missed the lunch rush as the table certainly could have used a good wipe down, but once I dug into our tasty bites, it was easy to see how a seemingly tidy sandwich and salad combo could get a little sloppy. After all, these aren&#39;t for the faint of heart.

Besides the &#39;crumby&#39; tables, my only let down was checking their online menu before hand and seeing way more options there than in person at the establishment, but in a way I&#39;m glad it happened that way because it forced me to order outside my comfort zone and helped me find new things that I wouldn&#39;t normally have chosen for myself, that I actually really enjoyed. 

I wish it were easier to get around downtown Barrington&#39;s cockamamie traffic flow so it wouldn&#39;t be so painful to get here, but even that wackadoo city planner of B-town won&#39;t keep me from suckin&#39; down salads and packing on the panini."

Because of this I get to eat out pretty frequently and actively search out the small privately owned greasy spoons instead of frequently visiting Mickey D&#39;s, BK, or Taco Bell. 
Last week one of my employee&#39;s who I enjoy having lunch with the most because of our culinary enthusiasm, asked me how that salad place in Barrington was because I live near there. Uhhh, never went, was my reply. 
Today was my chance to change all that. My wife and I were working at our rental in the village, when I complained that it was time to enjoy some lunch. &#34;So where should we eat?&#34; she asked.  We should try that salad place next to Subway is what I offered. When I arrived there was a cluster of Barrington moms chatting in the tiny dining area, I stood patiently at the counter for what must have been 5 minutes waiting for someone to come to the counter to take my order. Only then did I notice in the clutter on the counter, the bell and sign suggesting to strike it for service. Really? There must be some intense salad science going on in the back area of the restaurant for no one to be manning the restaurant front counter during a late lunch period at 2pm!
 One of the staff finally arrived and quickly took my order of two half salads and two panini&#39;s. Two ladies began preparing my order. Before they began I was a little overwhelmed by the menu and especially the prices. $7. for a half salad and if you add some mediterranean chicken it&#39;s a $2.50 addition? Like I said, this better be some crazy good salad science. 
The meals took a little more than 10 minutes to prepare but once my wife and I were ready to enjoy it, we were not disappointed. The Caesar half salad for my wife was pretty good, but my Balsamic Blue was really tasty. I moved on to the Provolone Prosciutto panini. I&#39;m a big boy and I can EAT. But I could not eat more than half of this sandwich after enjoying the salad. It kept calling to me for several
more bites, there was no more room. 
My brain was saying MOOOOORE! But my stomach was reminding me that it was on the ropes and looking for break. My wife was got as far as three bites into her Caprese panini following her sald and she was done. Both of us were full and our found the meals to be tasty, filling, really enjoyable. Regardless of others who find the packaging that the meal is served in as less than savory, I like the fact that they are conscientious of the feed locally, operate globally mindset, of serving in packaging that is practical and effective. 
Now if they could do something about their price points and still remain profitable, I would be thoroughly enthused about visiting a lot more frequently. For now, I&#39;m really fond of this place and their meals. But I better do a lot more installations to be able to afford eating here as much as I would like.  When my pocket has some extra green in it, I&#39;ll be back to try the other items on that menu."

Recommendations to improve.  The menu is unclear to newbies. Had no idea my sandwich came with chips.  Then got charged extra when i askedfor another flavor.  The baked goods look like displays not for sale. So I assumed I also had a drink.  Nope. And turned down for an extra pickle.

Today, I ordered the chopped salad.  The avocado wasn&#39;t chopped, it was chunked. Where was the bacon?  Since I was eating my salad at Savory Salad, I asked the girl who made my salad if she added bacon. She said a little. There was none. She have me extra bacon on the side. When I showed her the chunk of avocado, she offered to cut it. I said I&#39;d do it myself.

I ordered a ham panini, and my wife ordered a chopped salad.  Our wait time after ordering was a little over 20 minutes, which was a little longer than I expected.  The ingredients were very fresh, and made to order, so I don&#39;t have a problem with a 5-10 minute wait, but at 20 minutes I was starting to lose my patience.

The panini was fresh -- ham, bread, mustard, and provolone -- simple but tasty.  Portion size was especially large, I can&#39;t think of anywhere that I&#39;ve ordered a panini that came out larger than this one was.  I would have traded half of it in exchange for a pickle and a small side (salad, potato salad, or anything like that).

The chopped salad had a little too much dressing for my wife&#39;s taste, but I tried it and really liked it.  If I go back, I&#39;ll probably order the chopped salad instead of a panini.  I&#39;m not usually one to order salads, but this one was quite good and would be my choice next time.

The staff was friendly, but with four people working and bumping into each other a little bit, it seemed like the cause of the slow food prep was a need for a little better organization.

Pros: excellent chopped salad, fresh ingredients, friendly staff

Cons: wait time was too long, and &#34;I&#39;ll trade you half of this panini if you&#39;ll give me a side&#34;"

My dad had a turkey croissant, no condiments or fixins but he still loved it and said it was delicious. 

As someone who is trying to pinch pennies more often than not lately, I may not frequent Savory Salads weekly. But there&#39;s a good chance I&#39;ll make an exception when the sign says Cream of Chicken Rice the next time I drive by. I mean, who can pass up cream of chicken rice soup?!

I&#39;m seriously shocked that it only has 3 stars at the moment.  Not sure what others are looking for in a restaurant, but what I love about this place is...

Everything is fresh and made in house!!  The homemade bread and pastries are another level above any and all franchise restaurants you could stop at.  Fresh is best!

The coffee bar is incredible!  Lots of options and brewed right there.  MMmm.

Decor is quant and makes you feel comfortable the moment you walk in.  They really have done a nice job of making it cozy!

The salads and panninis are huge!!  Great portions and they save pretty well for leftovers too!

I have been at all different times of the day and yes you have to wait for your food (about 5 min) but if you read the paragraph above....it&#39;s all fresh and made right as you order!!!  Of course you are going to have to wait.  This isn&#39;t the golden arches that has gross unhealthy, unnatural food!  People are so bazaar with their food expectations....let&#39;s be realistic. 

Im really happy that someone has gotten it right when it comes to quick service resturaunts and I applaud the owner!  Nice job and I will continue to return and be one of your many happy and satisfied customers!!

Because Stephanie and her team are always trying something new, you might not get your order out in thirty to forty five seconds.  (Pssst, Tiffany T.: if you want that, go to Mc Donalds to soak up your martinis).

I tended to like  the cardboard box, as I could take my unfinished portion with me if I chose to and it wasn&#39;t styrofoam!  I have a very special diet and can&#39;t eat out many places but they accommodated me beautifully.  The salad was fresh and tasty.  Brett was right they only have 7 salads but you can add in different meats and/or order paninis  and wraps.  They also have soups.  When asked a question about the dressing ingredients my server took the time to find out and suggest a dressing that I could have instead of just saying &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.  They made my salad exactly the way I needed and it was delicious.  For those trying to follow a specific diet like Paleo or Whole 9 this is a place you can eat if you make special requests they will listen.  I will be back and hope this place does well.

If I was just eating the food it would be 5 stars. The problem is the amount of time to receive an order. I have waited 20-25 minutes for a salad. I would stop here more often for lunch but cannot wait that long for food with my kids. There is only one salad station which makes the orders go very slow. Maybe they should have another station set up in the back for phone orders?  I really hope they can improve on the amount of time to make the food because it is really good.

Really well laid out, nice variety and very easy to order.  When I arrived at the location, looked really small. However when you enter, the lady behind the counter was beyond nice. Very understanding and made my pickup fast and professional. A lot nicer and seemed to enjoy talking to people more than the lady at Hunan Wing in Lake Zurich.  They also have their hot mustard, soy, sweet n&#39; sour up front for you if you need extra. 

Now the food.  And I should say from the get go, the amount of food you get is definitely worth the price.  A lot of leftovers.  Appetizers ordered were egg rolls, which were great, and the teriyaki beef, which was far from it.  Looked dry and tough, both of which are true.  Hunan Wing&#39;s Teriyaki Beef is way, way better.  

We ordered for entrees: Kung Pao Chicken, Hong Kong Delite (beef, BBQ pork, shrimp &amp; scallops), General Tso&#39;s Chicken and Large order of Chow Mein noodles.  All entrees were great. Will be enjoying the leftovers for probably the rest of the week. 

So out of this, Hunan Wings Teriyaki Beef is definitely better. Hong Kong Lite takes the egg rolls. A toss up for the General Tso&#39;s, but it goes to Hunan Wing. But definitely Hong Kong gets the nod for better Kung Pao and Hong Kong Delite (Happy Family).  When you ask for extra spicy, boy do they deliver. Definitely will be going back."

The fried dumplings were awesome, not those wimpy dumplings, with nothing in them that come from so many other locations.  They were thick, still warm, and fully stuffed.  They came with the usual dumpling sauce. 
The General Tso&#39;s chicken was good.  I ordered basic spicy and there were several whole chilis in the mix.  I was expecting a bit more heat, but the flavor was true to the dish.  The chicken was still moist, the breading a little thicker than expected but not overly done, and the sauce had a good balance of spice with hint of sweetness.   

Hint: if you like heat, go with extra spicy

Well, as a foreigner to these strange shores (I&#39;m traveling for work and don&#39;t have a ton of time to eat -- that&#39;s my definition of foreigner), I came back. Despite it being a 2-star place. Why? Desperation, mostly. 

The food isn&#39;t going to kill you (though if you eat too much of it, I&#39;m sure clogged arteries are in order), but it&#39;s really not that good. There&#39;s too much sauce and it&#39;s not fine dining. But for the cost, and really, what it is, it&#39;s decent. They give you a tonnnn of food so you will absolutely be left full. Don&#39;t get the large sized anything unless you plan on sharing. You don&#39;t need it.

The joint is more 2.5 star than just a flat 2, to be honest, because they give you a lot of food and it&#39;s reasonably edible. Yelp won&#39;t let me do that, so 2 star it is. Having said that, in my desperation to get away from sandwiches that I&#39;ve been eating pretty much everyday, this was a brief respite, and I enjoyed it.

That&#39;s the greeting I get every time the delivery guy rings my doorbell.  Every time. It can be 10 degrees and snowing outside (like it was last time I ordered delivery) and he&#39;ll always be there with a smile and some small talk, and maybe a little jibe about how I always order the same thing.
That same thing that I always order is Beef Fried Rice, Orange Beef, and Crab Rangoon. No MSG. And that&#39;s important, and Hong Kong Lite is very accommodating. 
The food is fine the first time, but the leftovers are BANGIN&#39;. I&#39;m all about second-day chinese food!"

The smoothies are not worth it honestly. Time and time again I got bad smoothies hoping for a good one. The fruit is not fresh and neither is the tapioca. I saw them take the coconut for my smoothie out of a can and microwave the tapioca. The tapioca is always bad, almost always frozen, and because of that, they are not a chewy consistency but they just break really nasty in your mouth. 

I gave them three stars because the rice really is delicious. But its not a place you would go sit down to eat, just take out. Oh, and also, they give you a LOT of rice when you order take out. They really pack it in those boxes! Love the portions."

They have everything on the lunch special menu availanle for dinner for just a dollar more. The delievery is extremely fast and the delivery drivers have always been friendly. 

The downfall of this place is the appetizers. The crab rangoon is made with fake crab meat, and believe me you can tell. The hot and sour soup was not either hot or sour. The eggrolls are just ok, kind of bland. Other then the appetizers I would still greatly order the entrees"

Well one lazy, OK I&#39;ll call it what it was, one hangover induced Sunday I decided I needed something, anything to eat and the only real requirement was that I would move as little as possible in getting said meal. I stumbled upon Hong Kong Lite on grub-hub and after a perusal of the reviews and noting they delivered I decided to give them a shot. I ordered a large jumbo shrimp fried rice and two shrimp/pork egg rolls. The food arrived much quicker than grub hub estimated and it was PIPING hot. The rice and all ingredients in it were ultra fresh. The sprouts were crunchy and the green onions did their flavorful best.  The shrimp are very generiously given and they are BIG. How big? I usually use my spoon to slice them in half so that I can have a spoonful of rice and shrimp. They are otherwise too large to fit rice and shrimp on the same spoon. Could there be a better problem to have? Perhaps the most enjoyable element of all is this spicy sauce they have for .25 a cup. it takes the flavor of an already wonderful dish to an all new height. Seriously, two to three cups per large order of fried rice and - YESSIR!!  The egg rolls were also fresh, crisply fried and had nice crunchy veggies accompanying the bits of shrimp/pork inside. I&#39;d do this review a huge injustice if I didn&#39;t mention the portion size. Their large, which is the only size I have gotten, is really a family size masquerading in a large box. When I say huge, I mean they literally have to staple that carton closed.  Usually the poor staple is just barely clasping the outter lids together due to the mound of protruding, steaming hot rice underneath.( poor stapler never stood a chance, lol.) I can also say that the experience I am sharing as far as food quality and delivery has been consistent over the 5 or 6 times I have ordered. True to my manly form, I am so satisfied with the fried rice that I have struggled in trying to sample a new dish here. I have yet to make any headway in that struggle. 

I started my review reflecting on my mom&#39;s advice and the old addage goes: mother always know best. Considering this gem I discovered despite her warnings about being lazy,  I&#39;d say that if you have a hankering for good Chinese fried rice, you&#39;ve got to put Hong Kong Lite on the list. Or else, mama said KNOCK YOU OUT!!"

I was in a rush when I came in and left before they could hand me one the smoothie I ordered. They called me back and apologized when I came back even though it was as much my fault as theirs that the smoothie wasn&#39;t picked up.

Food was good and tasted pretty fresh. I enjoyed the Won Ton soup in particular. Not a gourment Chinese restaurant by any means, but it is pretty good when compared to the other Chinese take-out places in the area. Portions are generous.

So I turned to my friends on Yelp to see what I could find...and we found Hong Kong Lite.  
One of my favorite items on most Chinese take away menus is cashew chicken, and the item I always order when trying a new place.  So we ordered the cashew chicken, hunan chicken, and the pot stickers.  I was pleasantly surprised by everything.  The food was super hot when it arrived which was a nice surprise when ordering delivery.  The portions are huge, we will both have enough for lunch tomorrow :-)  There was a good amount of actual chicken in both dishes(some times it&#39;s more veg then meat), and big chunks of it too!  
We will definitely order from them again!!!"

If you live in Palatine, you know that getting good Asian delivered is nearly impossible. I suggest beef and broccoli or Chicken and broccoli, but I&#39;m boring like that. Also, I tend to order beef, pork, and shrimp fried rice (just off the normal combination rice) and they always get it right, unlike the &#39;other guy&#39;!

The food we had was very good: home made chicken noodle soup with a lemon-cream base, very good baked egg plant with a very good filing and tomato sauce, a baked egg/feta cheese rolls (very good) and the cream caramel (big yummy for this flan-type dessert). This food was exceptional good in my opinion. Took home a yogurt/cucumber soup, another chicken and one of those egg/cheese bakery roles.

I&#39;m going back. There was a steady stream of customers....something is mighty good there.

If you have never had Bulgarian food, this place is a good start to expose your virgin tastebuds to new frontiers.  For beginners like myself, it&#39;s pretty easy to order from pictures posted above the counter.  Try the grilled kebab, sausage or the awesome schnitzel...that breaded wonder of a chop was big, juicy and came steaming hot from the fryer.  Also, try the soup.  They are rich, pack with ingredients and very tasty.  The use of summer savory (chubritsa)  appears to be a hallmark herb used in a number of dishes I tried...very refreshing.  The patrons appear to be regulars or are familiar with Bulgarian cuisine.  The place is severely understaffed and the service can be slow.  But that&#39;s all good. I was there for the food...great food.  Highly recommended."

1) It was so dark in the restaurant part that two of us had to use a flashlight to read the menu.
2) To start off, we ordered a Cosmo and I ordered a Maple Manhattan (one of their signature drinks).  Both were served up in  ~ 8-10 oz martini glasses.  The last time I ordered the Maple Manhattan ($12) it was served on the rocks in a big rocks glass with a maple bacon strip.  Mom asked me to taste the Cosmo and I had to agree that it tasted like there was no vodka in it.  The server was very gracious and took it away while my Mom ordered a beer instead.
3) We ordered the Crispy Calamari ($12) which were delicious.  The problem is that the order was very small - about half the volume that you would get in any Italian restaurant.
4) I ordered the Cast Iron Taco Seared Barramundi.  Although it was well prepared and the seasoning was very tasty, it was a relatively small portion served on a bed of cauliflower leek mashed. I just wasn&#39;t impressed.  At $24 it wasn&#39;t particularly expensive but still left me hungry.

The pluses were our attentive server and the Mud pie we shared for dessert.

I hope this was just an off night because I really like Prairie River.  On the other hand, if they are consciously trying to cut expenses by keeping the lights dim, skimping on their pours and offering small portions, I&#39;m not sure if I will be back."

The food tasted bland, the service was extremely slow, the waiter was not educated about the menu, and the ambiance of this place was non existent. 

We waited for quite a while to get our drinks, and order food. They also didn&#39;t bring out any bread until I asked for it. The bread and the church street beer were good when we finally got them.

The soup they had on special, sausage and corn chowder, was overly salty. 

I ordered the ribs, the menu stated that they came with cauliflower mash, but when they came out, there were some soggy fries on the plate.The sauce on the ribs had hardened by the time they brought them out, super unappetizing.

This restaurant is okay if you&#39;re staying at the hotel and you&#39;re in a pinch, but I would not recommend making an effort to come here for dinner."

The second day I ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad, in my opinion, pretty hard to screw up. I think they should have named it &#34;Our version of a Caesar Salad&#34;.. It was terrible.. It had sunflower seeds and other nutty things in it, romaine lettuce and another lettuce and the dressing was terrible  My daughter hated the Mac n Cheese, so I tasted it and I can see where she was coming from, it tasted like beer cheese, which my 8 year old would of course hate."

I don&#39;t know. They have kick ass pizza, but no refrigerator or microwave to store the left overs int he rooms. The pizza crust is thin, and I&#39;ve had both the pepperoni, and the Canadian bacon. Both were good, but why? I had to leave the damn left overs in the restaurant.

The Taco pizza was horrid. It was unflavored and needed salt or something. I don&#39;t add extra salt to my food, but this meh. The beer was cold. The service was great.

They do offer a kid&#39;s menu, but they don&#39;t tell you that. That way there&#39;s no left overs. I&#39;d get in my car and drive it to Tree Guys and not go to Prairie River, which I intend to do this weekend.

Server was extremely attentive until presented with a restaurant.com certificate, and then she went MIA for the first time throughout the whole meal. 

There were some hits: 

The tomato gratin soup was rich and delicious.
The asian-pear dressing for the side salad was divine.
The warm basket had a great assortment of unique breads.
The carrot cake. Huge piece that was moist and flavorful.
The gratin potato side. Very rich and cheesy.
The service, until the end. 

There were also some misses:

The pommes croquettes - not sure what they were going for here, but the texture and taste didn&#39;t mesh well. The server said it was their spin on jalepeno poppers but I didn&#39;t get that at all. 

The nan quesadillas - taziki sauce with a quesadilla? Way too many onions as well. 

The Jack Daniels angus filet. Delicious but not cooked to order and have no idea why the JD label. My medium was more medium rare. Y&#39;all know I hate that. But again, it was delicious. 

The service, at the end. Waited almost 20 minutes for the discounted check. I don&#39;t know if the server thought she&#39;d get a discounted tip and was expressing her passive-aggressive disdain for us poor folk using the certificate. Tipped 21% on full value of the meal. Lesson to be learned here is that poor doesn&#39;t equal dumb or cheap. 

All in all, this was a delightful meal that was a feast for the eyes as well as the belly. Had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day,"

The chef really has a delicate and creative touch with flavor combinations, and we enjoyed (almost) everything we ordered.  

The mahi mahi sandwich and caprese panini were the perfect combination of sweet and savory, and the balsamic glaze added elegance to the flavors. The Prairie burger was huge and came with a bacon wrapped pickle (yes please!).  The airplane chicken and steak entrees were perfectly cooked and came with this amazing jalapeno cornbread and peach preserves, and the house soups were tasty.  The chicken caesar salad was blah...but it was a blah order so I wasn&#39;t disappointed.

Firstly , I have tried pretty much all of the different tacos on their menu. I personally love Asada(steak), Lengua( Tongue) and my favorite is their Barbacoa which is very tender and tasty flavored. 

My other favorite on the menu is the Mojarra Frita. Its a very well-done fish. Very light and delicious..however, you have to wait 10-15 minutes when you order, so I usually order over the phone and go to pick it up.

There are no words to describe the flavor of the steak.  It&#39;s cooked well done, not too chewy/hard, enough flavor, it is just right!

I&#39;ve tried the enchiladas, burritos tacos and nachos all get 5 stars.

The place is very well-hidden and somewhat small.  There are tables to dine-in if you desire but I was just just there for takeout.  

I ordered Chicken Tacos for my wife, and the server knew to ask me if I wanted cilantro/onion or cheese/lettuce.  Like the good gringo I am, I opted for the latter and hung my head in shame for not going authentic.  At least I can blame my wife!  She enjoyed the tacos -- not the best she&#39;s had but she would go back.

For me, I got the &#34;big&#34; steak burrito.  What can I say -- it was so good my dog gave me a crazy look for eating it too fast.  Definitely a meal in itself but since I was in an &#34;eat everything within arm&#39;s reach&#34; mode, I also tried &#34;big&#34; chicken quesadilla I brought home with me.  Very tasty as well, but not perfect.  They could have used a little &#34;something&#34; as they were a bit plain, but still good.  

Finally, I always like to try different salsas, so I ordered some salsa and chips.  The former definitely had some kick and I was soon reaching for my lemonade to put out a bit of the fire.  I&#39;ve had hotter but this was good.  A bit of a smoky flavour, but not overwhelming.  

I had trouble writing this review because I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s anything unique or original about Taqueria Azteca, but what I ordered was done right and tasty.  Kind of feels like a future &#34;old standard&#34; that I could get used to.

FYI... This is not, I repeat, not a fancy establishment; in fact I don&#39;t know that fancy should even be included anywhere in this review, but the food is authentically delicious.. Dining in is an option (not one I really recommend) but being that it is only a few blocks from my house I prefer to enjoy their fantastic tacos in my own casa.

The portion also came with a side of miso soup. 

The Miso soup was good, not too salty or watery, and seasoned well to bring out that savory flavor. The tempura pieces were nicely fried to a golden brown, a bit oily, but still delicious nonetheless. The fish and shrimp were fresh, and tasted great with the seasoned rice.

They serve Tempura dishes with sauce and side of rice and also Tendon which is Tempura on a bowl of rice and includes a bowl of Miso Soup.

I ordered the Seafood Tempura plate that did not include rice or any sides, almost like a Tempura appetizer.  I don&#39;t normally eat that much plain rice so this was perfect for me and the price was lower as well.  My wife ordered the Seafood Tendon.  We placed our orders and waited for our number to be called (they offer fast, courteous, and efficient self-service).

After 5-10 minutes our order was up and we sat down to eat.  But I noticed they had neglected to provide the Daikon Oroshi (grated daikon radish) with the Tempura dipping sauce.  Real authentic Tempura always comes with Daikon Oroshi!  They quickly apologized and gave it to me...just in time to not lose a star :).

The results were delicious and I would even say some of the best Tempura we have had; that from someone who spent three years in Japan not to mention my wife who grew up there.  The batter fried to a light and crispy texture and everything was cooked to perfection, including the vegetables.  The Miso Soup was good but a little saltier than we like.  The staff was friendly and quickly corrected the missing part of my order.  This may be my new favorite place to eat when we are back in this area."

I decided to try the Chicken Tempura and added a Shrimp Tempura as well.  The bowls also comes with Nori, some tempura vegetables, Tempura egg (yep, a Tempura egg! How awesome is that!), and a miso soup all for $10.98!

I will return to try other items on their menu, that&#39;s for sure!"

I had the chicken tendon----and the fried egg was a surprise to me and made the rest of my day.  Yep eggs are so awesome and they make me happy.  Surprisingly after eating everything I did not feel like a grease ball so that&#39;s a bonus.  Like others the person taking orders not so excited to be there---but I wouldn&#39;t imagine leaving your workplace smelling like fried things would be too exciting---but my service was ok--just nothing stellar or off putting so guess it was good enough."

Excellent tempura, I ordered the Chicken Tendon and wasn&#39;t disappointed. Tendon btw is a tempura bowl! Anyway, the Chicken Tendon came with chicken, 2 pieces of fried shrimp, rice, and a fried egg you can cut open and mix the egg yolk into your tendon. It tasted so good, even if it was a little pricey($9.25 before tax). Blows the shrimp tempura I once had at Taste of Chicago many years ago(maybe Guey Lon?), out of the water!

Between this, Santouka, and a 3rd place I forget the name of inbetween there and the Japanese ice cream place, lol I think I&#39;m trying now to come up with any excuse I can to come back to Mitsuwa&#39;s food court! The food really was that darn great here, between Hannosuke and the ice cream place. Which btw I annoyingly still don&#39;t remember the name of lol, but I&#39;m sure I will later! I&#39;ll review Mitsuwa overall, another time. Probably after 1-2 more visits.

If you&#39;re coming from the city via public transit, taking the Blue Line to Rosemont and then the Pace #606 Northwest Limited bus(which is a partial express bus along I-90, but stops locally along the rest of the route) is one way you can get out here, via getting off at the Algonquin Rd/Tonne Dr stop. Also if you take the #208 Golf Rd. bus, getting off at Golf/Arlington Heights Rd. will only put you 3 blocks north of here, and a short walk south to here. Absolutely worth the stop to eat at(and probably the other food court places are too), if you&#39;re in this area!"

My food came out pretty fast, and I enjoyed the miso soup that comes with the set. The tempura was super crispy and fresh when it came out. The sauce that comes with it is DELICIOUS. I think that is what makes the bowl itself. I would highly recommend if you aren&#39;t feeling ramen. I&#39;m glad they added this as one of the shops!

I got the vegetable tempura with hot soba.  The veggie tempura was pretty good; sort of greasy, but most tempura winds up being that way.  Can&#39;t complain about that.  However, the soba noodles were a letdown.  Very thin, and not much texture or flavor.  The same description unfortunately applies to the broth, which was quite bland.

As expected, there&#39;s some light sauce already on the Tendon, and you also get pickled ginger to cleanse your palate between bites. I got the Chicken Tendon, which was served with a variety of other vegetable tempura on a generous bed of rice. The counter also has some strong spicy ish soy sauce for people who feel that the tempura are not flavored enough. The vegetable tempura was sufficiently flavored that I did not need to have extra sauce, though I felt that the slice of chicken was rather thick so I had to dip a little bit of the sauce. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really eat seafood so I replaced shrimp with chicken and vegetable - I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had gotten shrimp or more vegetables instead of chicken. Chicken is probably better made in a karaage or tonkatsu style than as a tempura. While tempura is not something I frequently eat, Hannosuke definitely represented the tempura donburi very well."

A small bowl of miso soup was served to complete the meal. I opted for a small bowl of their sauce for dipping. 

The tempura was perfectly prepared. The vegetables were still fresh tasting, not soggy. The fish and shrimp were flavorful. The sauce was really good. I recommend that extra for dipping. The egg was amazing. It was poached perfectly, and was good with the rice.

I tried the Cheesy Beef on garlic with sweet peppers and fries with shack sauce. My boyfriend got the Italian Beef with hot peppers with fries.

I&#39;m very observant so I was able to scan the place while waiting for our order. The place is clean, employees look genuinely happy about their jobs. Majority of diners ordered cheesy beef on garlic. I know this because the cashier has a distinct mic. I also saw the cook pull out the bag of Turano bread which is a must have. The beef was seasoned to perfection and very tasty. I like it better than Portillo&#39;s and Buena Beef. No shakes but that&#39;s OK.

It sure was on FAT TUESDAY! (who can resist a place named Beef Shack anyway?).

A perfect excuse to indulge in all things fattening with reckless abandon and leave your inner skinny girl in the closet...lock her up and throw away the key...

I mean c&#39;mon...this used to be the former Zippy&#39;s &#34;Home of The Cheezy Beef&#34;..
A joint I had scrumptious scandalous cheesy beefy memories of...Unrivaled by others. 
And yes, I was completely sad that I never got one last taste of Zippy&#39;s before it closed...

I was salivating this gloriousness again, hoping it would satisfy the zippiness in me, so
I hauled my little culo into the Drive-thru (gotta love drive-thru&#39;s) and placed my order to the awesome guy working.  Super nice &amp; no order hick-ups.  He even mentioned that fries come with Dog in case I didn&#39;t want a whole bag. I appreciated that. I Got -  Cheezy beef on garlic, (sweet &amp; hot peppers on side), Cheeze fries, plain hot dog....(no, my skinny girl didn&#39;t lose her mind, she was SHARING, not hoarding).  And yeah, I went a little cheezy...

Menu cuts to the chase. They only serve:  Beefs, burgers, dogs, one salad, grilled cheese and fries..that&#39;s it.  I dig small menus...whew.  I&#39;ll admit I browsed reviews here.  Some reported beefs where just like Zippy&#39;s, while others didn&#39;t.  Some said owners use the same recipe...my head was sort of spinning on what to expect...yet, I remained a hopeless Zipmantic, confident this love would return to me..

Was it unrequited?  :*(

While the tantalizing soft garlicky inner grilled bread and cheesy mozz layer didn&#39;t leave me, the beef did..The most important element...Although it didn&#39;t COMPLETELY leave me, the beef itself didn&#39;t remind me of Zippy&#39;s.  They didn&#39;t skimp on the beef that&#39;s for sure..I have no &#34;beef&#34; there. It was a hearty sandwich, but beef was dryer and not as thin and tender as I remember..

Beef was thicker sliced and had a sponge-like texture. SORT OF reminded me of Arby&#39;s texture and was average quality...It WAS tasty, but by no means did it relive my memories....

Fries were almost identical to Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s, but BETTER.   Hot &amp; heaping Fresh cut in a brown paper bag sporting oil stains left and right...I&#39;m no fryaholic, but these were so good (sometimes Crinkle doesn&#39;t cut it).  I know people who&#39;d kill for these fries.  The cheese sauce was too tangy &amp; robust for my fries.  Dog was covered in fries (another flashback to G&amp;J).  Soft steamed bun.  Didn&#39;t taste like a Vienna dog.  I know there&#39;s different grades out there...what I&#39;m sayin is, this dog was for the dogs....little flavor, little snap. I&#39;d hit Portillo&#39;s for dogs (or an awesome Italian beef).

Beef Shack might be where its at for beef....and only beef, be it a burger or cheezy B.
A bit pricey, but worth a taste.  They offer Mini beefs which is great when your inner skinny girl is with you and needs a cheat day....or you just wanna give it a go...

As far as true cheezy beefs go, the perfect amount of yummy melted cheese will satisfy the cheesiest of tastebuds. The bread is pretty great. Not bad for Beef Shack.."

I tried again Friday after taking a detour home from work that had me passing by.  I went through the drive up this time instead of eating inside.  
First impression...the guy taking the order and (I&#39;m assuming) the same guy at the window was a jerk!  Seriously.  A tiny bit of kindness can go a long way.  Especially since I didn&#39;t make any special requests on my order.   
I certainly felt like maybe I was bothering him by coming to spend my money there. 

But on to the food.   Again, I&#39;ll comment that it is just really expensive compared to other Italian beefs in the area and the name of the restaurant leads you to believe they would be the best.  

And the fries.   Good god, could you all please learn how to cook French fries?  They were a bag full of oil soaked fries.   You could tell even by looking at them.   Limp.  Just, disgusting.   I took a picture to share with you all.  

The only saving grace of this wasted meal was the sandwich itself.   Still seriously lacking in the amount of beef they put on the sandwich.  But the bread is different than what is used at other places and I prefer this bread.   The beef was flavored better than I recall from last time.  

Honestly, I cannot recommend this place.   So many places offer delicious Italian beef in the area for better prices, better filled sandwiches and you aren&#39;t treated like crap for wasting your money at their institution."

Why? I have no friggin idea. It&#39;s massive popularity I have always found curious considering the food they have on tap. That said, this Hoffman Estates heavyweight does serve up some pretty good grub for it&#39;s type, I just don&#39;t drink the Kool Aid like most folks around here. 

&#34;The shack&#34;, as it is referred to colloquially, serves up Chi-town fast food favorites. Dogs, polish, burgers, cheesy beef, Gyros, etc. are all here, and prices are dirt cheap. Depending on the day you show up, you can score a double dog with fries and a drink for under 5 bucks. It&#39;s exceedingly difficult to have problems with that level of value. The fresh cut fries here are sensational, assuming you show up at a time when they are relatively fresh. 

The Shack is always busy, with almost no exception. If you show up here around noon on a weekday there will be a line out the door. That said, they fire out food to customers with military precision, so you will never wait long. 

Food quality here has always been consistent, but I just do not understand the big deal. If you have never been here before go with a dog combo. It&#39;s tasty and comes loaded up with zing relish and sport peppers. All dogs also come with fries plastered all over the place. 
To me, Beef Shack just sorta is what it is, but the locals here adore this joint and the food is both cheap and tasty. You could do a hell of a lot worse if you are looking to grab lunch."

My husband got a garlic cheesy combo and I had a regular combo and we had fries.  Very tasty.  I thought their beefs were better than Portillos, yes that is saying a lot but for me it was.  

Cons - 

Very small menu, definitely not a lot to choose from, we were surprised they did not at least have more options like onion rings and mozzarella sticks.  

Also, I am not a big fan of their au jus, it tasted more like simple oil instead of a yummy juice.

Pros-

Food was still tasty, they do have a catering menu that looks fabulous, next time we go we will place an order on this menu

Overall, if you want a great beef, definitely check this place out."

Beef:
The beefs are very flavorful and come with the standard offerings (hot/sweet peppers, au jus) but what I also appreciate is that they offer a &#39;half&#39; size. Sometimes I want an Italian beef, but a whole sammich is too much....especially when ordering fries (and potentially a shake). On one occasion, I requested sweet peppers and only got one pepper. It was a bummer, but I&#39;ve forgiven them since then and not too worried about future visits.

Fries:
Greasy, fresh cut fries; so awesome. Dunk &#39;em in ketchup, or eat them plain; you can&#39;t go wrong. If you REALLY want to up the ante....go for the &#34;Shack Sauce&#34;. You won&#39;t be disappointed, however it MAY ruin fries for you at other locations. I&#39;m giving you a fair warning.

I know Beef Shack is my go to beef spot, because I live really close to a Buona location &amp; honestly don&#39;t even hesitate when I drive by BB to head to the Shack...
Despite being somewhat difficult to access (thanks to the Valli parking lot) Beef Shack is undoubtedly awesome."

I ordered the regular size and it was huge. Bigger than what you would expect from a beef joint. Meat was tender and juicy. Lots of mozzarella on this sandwich. The fries were hand cut and I ordered them with cheese. 

My daughter (11) had the grilled cheese sandwich. She&#39;s my picky eater but she devoured the entire sandwich without a complaint. 

My son (9) had a plain burger. The kid is not big on cheese (he does not get this from me lol). The burger was char grilled and very good.

My husband ordered the combo with cheese. Another winner

I recently returned here after a few months.  My first meal here was a five star experience &amp; after returning here agin I got to experience the same five star meal.  

Right away a few things stand out to you as you walk in the doors.  The place doesn&#39;t look like some cheap fast food restaurant.  Most hot dog &amp; beef establishments just throw the place together &amp; call it a restaurant &amp; cut costs on making it look nice but not this place.  This place looks like they spent a lot of money just to make it look nice.  The wood paneling gives it an upscale high class look which I can&#39;t say I have ever seen with a restaurant that serves hot dogs &amp; Italian beefs.  

Next, the food which is the most important part is also the best.  They offer three different types of Italian beefs.  They offer a regular Italian beef, a &#34;cheezy Italian beef&#34; &amp; lastly a &#34;cheezy beef on garlic.  All of the beefs are available in a regular size or a mini size for almost half the cost of the regular.  The regular is a very generous portion.  The &#34;cheezy beef&#34; on garlic&#34; is hands down the best Italian beef sandwiches I have had &amp; that is saying a lot especially with the competition in town.  

I usually am not a huge fan of getting burgers when I go out but the burgers here are delicious.  The burgers are Angus beef &amp; it is a pretty large portion.  They also have a special sauce called &#34;Shack sauce&#34;.  This sauce is a game changer.  Every time I have been here I have asked for extra sauce &amp; I usually order something else just to dip it in the &#34;Shack sauce&#34;.  For drinks you can get a 24 oz cup for $1.89 &amp; it is fountain drinks so you can have as much as you want.  

The hot dogs here won&#39;t disappoint either.  All of the hot dogs are Vienna beef.  They offer two different kinds.  They have the regular dog or the double dog.  If you are looking for an option that is healthier than Italian beefs, bugers or hot dogs, they do have a Shake salad.  As for the french fries they are all fresh cut &amp; seasoned very well.  

This particular Beef Shake location does have a drive thru.  

Overall you can&#39;t go wrong by eating here.  They don&#39;t have a hundred items on the menu because the items they do have on it have been perfected.  It is always a good experience eating here &amp; I look forward to eating here again."

If you want and/or are looking for a really good, FANTABULOUS beef sandwich on garlic bread with mozzarella, this is the place to go!

There aren&#39;t too many places that I can think of that have fresh cut fries. I do LOVE fresh cut fries over regular french fries. 

It might seem just a tad pricey but, for what you get, it&#39;s not bad. The sandwich is quite large. One bag of fries can be shared by two (unless you really love fresh cut fries a lot, in that case, get your own bag)! Free refills on drinks. 

Besides Nana&#39;s in Streamwood, now I know where else to go for those fresh cut fries (which I can&#39;t stop raving about) as well as that beef sandwich on garlic bread! LOL

I would give them 10 stars!!

It&#39;s new &amp; improved &amp; I think for the better. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of Zippy&#39;s and although Beef Shack uses the same building, some of the same menu items and apparently has the same management, I like it much better. Michele K. is right on that the interior and exterior remind me of a quick service restaurant I&#39;d find at Disney World. To me, that&#39;s not a bad thing at all although I could see how it could put some people off. 

The menu is simple - burgers, dogs, beef &amp; fries. I went with a couple of coworkers and had myself the double dog. Not a bad deal at all for under $5 plus it came with a very generous serving of fries. I loved their fries! They were beyond greasy...but...they&#39;re fries. It&#39;s to be expected. The flavor and cut of the fries was spot on but just know the grease on the fries may just eat through the bag. I recommend getting a tub of their special Shack Sauce to dip the fries in. It&#39;s much better than having plain ol&#39; boring ketchup. I got my double dog plain and it had standard Vienna beef hot dogs on a plain bun. Nothing fancy, but I enjoyed it.

Beef Shack has a drive thru and a decently sized dining room. It gets quite busy at lunch! I will absolutely be back as my coworkers all raved that the beef is better than Portillo&#39;s!"

Cheeseburger was cooked medium well (perfect for me) with grilled bun and fresh lettuce and tomato ( i requested no chipoile mustard.) Fries are a good large portion, home made and cooked in hot enough oil to not be too greasy.
 
  I tried a reg beef w sweet peppers a few months ago and it was a good portion, very flavorful and comparable to the best beef sandwich shops in the area, if not the best.

As I&#39;m about to write this review I noticed some unfavorable reviews, and out of sheer curiosity I have to read them to know what there could be to complain about. After reading them, I&#39;m convinced they&#39;re bullcr@9. Specifically addressing the &#34;grease&#34; left on the paper - seriously? It&#39;s the LEAST greasy of any Italian beef sandwich I&#39;ve ever had! That&#39;s the generous au jus, on the most generous portion of delicious lean beef you&#39;ll ever get on a sandwich. I rarely eat fries, but have to make the exception for these. Try them, unlike anywhere else, THE BEST, well worth the calories. And order their special cheese sauce to dip them in, unfrikkenbelievable. Watched someone who special ordered them smothered in mozzarella with bacon, raving about them.

I can only vouch for the cheezy beef on garlic. It&#39;s the best! The combination of the bread, garlic flavor, roast beef, au jus and mozzarella is heavenly. I am of the opinion that I wish the beef was shredded and more flavorful like johnnies in Arlington heights but... Johnnies can&#39;t compete with the garlic spread and cheese.

The only reason it&#39;s 4 instead of 5 stars... I desperately miss the waffle fries that zippy&#39;s had. Beef shack now has hand cut fries done in peanut oil I think. The times I&#39;ve got them they are hit and miss. Sometimes over done and soggy, sometimes light and crispy perfection. Even with inconsistency, I&#39;m sure the new fresh fries are better/healthier than the previous waffle fries... But charge us more! Bring hem back??? Please???

The remodeling is a huge improvement from the previous Zippy&#39;s and the restaurant is well staffed and managed well but the food itself didn&#39;t quite leave an impression. 

What&#39;s better than a regular Italian beef? Cheesy Italian beef with sweet peppers on garlic bread. We also got the angus cheeseburger and fries with the Shack sauce. Although the Italian beef was a foot long, I couldn&#39;t help but think of Portillo&#39;s and for a $5 cheeseburger, it didn&#39;t quite measure up to Five Guys or Smash Burger.

The menu is pretty limited (at least in the drive through - I didn&#39;t walk in), a few types of beef offered various ways, a handful of sides, beverages, and a salad option.

Well.. not at this one but we&#39;ll get to that a little later We&#39;ll start this review with a story. A long long time ago I visited a place in Saint Charles called Beef Shack and I was pleased with the depression dog and fresh cut fries at a good value. Some time later I saw that a long time favorite spot of mine called Zippy&#39;s had closed, but in its place there was a sign mentioning a new Beef Shack would be opening soon. As the days went by Beef Shack eventually opened up and one day I finally had the opportunity to stop by this beef shack and give it a try.

In visiting the Beef Shack I decided to go with the hot dog that I had at the other location along with a cheesy beef. The inside had the same rustic wood decoration of the Saint Charles location and I had expected my food would be the same in quality. I placed my ordered, looked around at how they re-decorated and waited for my order to be ready. Besides adding lots of wood paneling they replaced a lot of the tables with and added stools with cow patch looking art on them.

Once my order was ready it was time to dig in, the first thing I tried was the hot dog. It was absolutely buried in fries. These were fresh cut fries but didn&#39;t taste quite as good as the ones served at the Saint Charles location. They were very greasy and had a strange cooking oil flavor that really didn&#39;t sit well with me. After I buried my hot dog out of the pile of fries I noticed it was covered with grease and residue from the  fries. The bun was almost completely soaked, my hot dog was a natural casing sausage with very very light condiment application except for relish which was excessively added. The bun was seedless and there were a few sport peppers on it. Despite quality ingredients being used here this was a messy hot dog, a sloppily prepared hot dog, and just a bad hot dog overall.

Now being called the Beef Shack I thought, &#34;well maybe the Cheesy Beef here is better&#34;. Well, I opened it up to see some almost hardened mozzarella cheese on the outside. The bread was tasty but a bit on the hard side with spots that were soft and spots that were too firm. The beef itself was very very bland, it could have been Arby&#39;s roast beef only I think that has a little more flavor to it. They were also very conservative in the amount of beef they put on the sandwich, this combined with the less than optimal bread meant you tasted the bread more than the beef. The cheese was okay but wasn&#39;t soft in any way shape or form and had the consistency and appearance of that elmers glue you would use to make projects with in elementary school. My overall opinion is that this was a bad Beef sandwich though it was not worse than the hot dog which was ruined by grease from the awful fries. 

I&#39;ve definitely had worse hot dogs, but going in with expectations of this being like the Saint Charles Beef Shack I came away thoroughly disappointed. I definitely miss the Zippy&#39;s that was previously occupying this spot as they had excellent chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. If you want a huge pile of nasty greasy fries and bland beef served on questionable bread then Beef Shack in Hoffman Estates is the place for you. Instead of calling it Beef Shack perhaps the &#34;S&#34; in the front of the second word in the title should be moved to the back of so it would be called Beef Hacks. I genuinely regretted having eaten here. One star for the Beef Shack in Hoffman Estates."

They weren&#39;t &#34;chinsy&#34; on the cheeze (or hot pepperz), the beef could&#39;ve been more thinly sliced (though, still tasty / juicy), but it was the bread that was on-the-money. Flavorful and nicely toasted. (It never decintergrated while in the palmz of my clutchez) And the friez were much like &#39;Gene &amp; Judez,&#39; so a total WIN. I got the &#34;Shack Sauce&#34; to add a lil&#39; adventure. Good (and interesting), but not really necessary.

I love that they load on the cheese, and then melt it.  This gives the fresh bread just the nicest little crunch.  Well flavored beef.  I&#39;m a hot peppers guy, which weren&#39;t overpowering- just enough on the samich.  I&#39;ve had both the reg. cheesy beef and the garlic; I did think the garlic was a bit overpowering which took away from tasting the beef, but was still very good.
The fresh cut fries even held up well to doing takeout and getting all the way back to the office for lunch. mmmm.

After what seemed like years, they finally opened their doors and I immediately noticed a lot of traffic through their tiny parking lot and drive-thru lane. Last night I finally had the chance to check it out.

A quick Google search will reveal that the owners of the old Zippy&#39;s also owns Beef Shack so Beef Shack menu items and &#34;mini&#34; serving options reflect this, albeit a much smaller menu. Beefs, hot dogs, burgers, fries, and salads are all that&#39;s on the Shack menu but the star of the menu is the same as it was for Zippy&#39;s: the cheezy beef. More specifically the cheezy beef on garlic bread.

We ordered a cheezy beef on garlic, a cheeseburger, and fries with Shack Sauce.  The roll is toasted with the beef, cheese, and peppers loaded on top which results in that classic flaky, crusty goodness on the outside of the bread with a creamy, melty cheese layer on top.  And the garlic bread...they mean garlic when they say garlic. I was afraid I would only get a hint of garlic flavor but this was a pungent kick of you-obviously-don&#39;t-have-a-date-tonight flavor.  And it was so much better than I remember the Zippy&#39;s version was. My only complaint was the bread to meat ratio was meager bordering on pathetic. Skimping on the beef is NOT the Chicago way and sincerely disappointed in that regard.

The burger was fresh and hand made and the bun was obviously fresh because both the patty and bun were pillow soft.  The toppings included cheese (optional) with lettuce and tomato with a microscopic dab of chipotle mayo. Where&#39;s the onion? I can only guess that they make the burger this way to avoid masking the flavor of the juicy patty and I can appreciate that style. My only complaint with the burger is the hefty price tag of $5 for such a small patty that is served a la carte. A small serving of fries to accompany it would justify the pricing.

They serve fresh cut fries here which you can see being cut and put directly in to the fryer. I love fresh cut fries but we has a few clumps that were undercooked which indicated that fries were overcrowded in the basket and not properly rotated while cooking. That&#39;s just a matter of method though and quality would obviously change between chefs.

While the Shack Sauce was fantastic and reminded me of a better version of McDonald&#39;s &#34;special Big Mac sauce,&#34; I was sorely disappointed to find that the tiny container I received was only half filled.  Really, guys? You&#39;re going to actually charge me 50 cents for sauce and then short me on the quantity? First of all, a sauce that lacks originality and is likely made from condiments that are readily available shouldn&#39;t be charged for and if it is charged for it should be served as a significant amount so that the sauce doesn&#39;t dwindle to nothing barely halfway through the only size order of fries available.  That&#39;s okay though, you won&#39;t trick me again next time. I&#39;ll just ask for some free mayo, ketchup, and relish on the side and make my own Shack Sauce, thankyouverymuch.

Overall a great meal, although expensive at $16 and change for three items and no drinks.  The interior and exterior projected unique, designer level ambiance which includes industrial touches such as pre-rusted corrugated metal awnings and extensive use of metal piping on everything from door handles to railings.  Everything is brand spanking new so everything is sterile clean, unlike the greasy dilapidated mess Zippy&#39;s condition was before closing. 

One of the best cheesy beefs I&#39;ve had due to the strong garlic flavor but other menu items don&#39;t seem to deserve much attention other than alternatives for those that aren&#39;t in the mood for a beef.  I&#39;m still glad we&#39;ve got a seemingly solid joint in the same spot as ol&#39; Zippy&#39;s and I acknowledge their wisdom in keeping a concentrated menu but I miss having an option for gyros so close to home. I&#39;ll just have to satisfy my grease cravings with that glorious garlic cheezy beef instead."

I used to love Zippy&#39;s and it&#39;s been around here for many years. And waffle fries!

But I recently learned that the owners of Beef Shack are associated with the Zippy&#39;s family and they have a very well reviewed location (as of this posting) in St. Charles. So why not, let&#39;s give them the benefit of the doubt.

Went through the drive-thru at this location and the service was very quick, efficient and friendly. Much appreciated. Their menu is basically a slimmed down version of Zippy&#39;s, and although some favorites of mine are no longer available (chicken gyro, waffle fries, onion rings), I&#39;ve always thought that a more simplistic menu at a place like this promotes better quality in the selections that they do have available (see: In-N-Out Burger).

I grabbed a cheesy beef on garlic bread with hot peppers and an order of fries. The fries were crispy and really well seasoned, fresh cut fries will always be a favorite of mine and Beef Shack does them really well. They also have a &#39;Shack Sauce&#39; available for an extra 50 cents which they said is some sort of Thousand Island dressing based dipping sauce. 

The beef sandwich is served on traditional Turano bread and they don&#39;t skimp on the cheese, which you&#39;ll find oozing out of the side of the sandwich. The beef is pretty well seasoned, but I must agree with another reviewer who said that they don&#39;t give you quite enough meat to get to the optimum bread to beef ratio. Because of this, the sandwich is just a little bit duller than it could be. Overall, though, the quality of the food is better than Zippy&#39;s has been over the past few years and that&#39;s what we&#39;re going for, right? I&#39;ll be making regular stops at the Beef Shack for sure!

Yummm... ok, back to lunch. :)"

Thus, after hearing that it&#39;s owned by the same people, I waited to see the reviews!  

My mom had a cheesy beef and she though that it could totally compete with Portillo&#39;s.  The only problem with the sandwich was that they give you a huge piece of bread and not enough meat.  Despite that, the beef was perfectly cooked. 

I had a burger and it was perfect.  I don&#39;t eat processed-cheese product, aka American cheese, so I asked if they can swap it with mozzarella and they had no problem accommodating me. 

The fries are fresh cut and you can probably share a bag with 3 people, that&#39;s just how much they give you.  It&#39;s funny when people complain about fries being &#34;too greasy&#34; and soaking through the bag.  It&#39;s fried, people! Those fries were downright amazing!

The food is made how you like it, in a bowl, a  jumbo burrito, tacos (crunch, soft flour/corn), and now salad styles of grilled steak, chicken, barbacoa, and carnitas.
I like their chicken corn tacos and fajita bowls and occasional steak.

So this is a typical chain and the layout and food are the same where ever you choose to be served, right?  I&#39;ve been to this location before, so I&#39;m reviewing this location as a not so great customer service experience that happen today of all days.  Do NOT go here unless you want some crappy attitude from the servers in the afternoon!

This place was near by the hospital that my dad was staying at (in the ICU) and we needed to order a late lunch.  When my sister&#39;s boyfriend got into the line he had an order for my sister over the phone of what she wanted in her bowl.  Then we had two more orders that he knew what they were so it would be quick.  Not only did they not ask how many items he would be ordering today, but they gave him attitude and told him to go back in line when he said I have two more orders!  Ok, I get it that there were 2 people waiting in line, but Chipotle had the audacity to tell him to move to the back of the line and place the other two orders while his burrito bowl sits on the counter!?!  Are you fricken kidding me!  Does it really take that much time to add 2 more orders that he already knew what to put on them?!?
Would that be so difficult to prep when there were a couple of servers?  I&#39;ve never heard of an establishment making someone go back into the line of folks with just half an order?!?

He didn&#39;t leave because he had a premade burrito bowl just sitting there for my sister and we were hungry and hadn&#39;t eaten most of the day.

I&#39;m very upset to hear this experience.  If you cannot accommodate the customer during a slow period (4:00pm CT), then how are you treating customers with needs during rush hours?

This location is no longer on top of my list of go to.  We will take our business elsewhere as there are plenty of other Chipotle locations to go to and we notice authentic Mexican restaurants nearby as well.  

I don&#39;t care who you are, we&#39;re paying customers and they should know better than telling a paying customer to move back into line, what are you the &#34;soup Nazi&#34;?!?  
You&#39;re not the only Chipotle in the area.

Now I know why this location has some weak, low star ratings.  If my family is desperate to come to this location, then maybe I will update my review.  But for now, I&#39;m giving this place 2 stars.  1 for the consistent flavors of the food and 1 because it&#39;s the closest location from the hospital.  

Chain restaurants need to know that the only way to stand out from the rest of your competitors and people coming back to spend their hard earned money is the Outstanding CUSTOMER SERVICE NOT crappy attitude!"

Sometimes they will do minor stuff like give me an old tortillas and it will just rip and all the meat, rice,etc will fall out.

sometimes they will give you cold meat.

Usually i get very little meat and lots of rice, cheese and lettuce. I dont mind this too much but still makes me think they are cheap.

Sometimes i will get little of everything on my burrito and it is tiny. I think the newer people do this so that they can wrap the burrito easier. The people who know what they are doing wrap burritos with ease but the newer people will do this so that when they wrap the burrito doesnt break.

Now The burritos taste amazing hence the reason why i  have been here over 10 times but I will never return to this location again. 

Here is why:


I walk in one day greeted by a friendly guy. Tell him i want chicken burito. 

He puts in a tiny amount of rice very tiny amount of chicken and very tiny amount  of rice and lettuce and cheese etc. 

the burrito is half the size of the one i usually get which is usually small anyways.

It looked a lot more like a taco then a burrito.

now i understand he was maybe new.

but then i tell the other worker that my burrito looks very small today and she says 

&#34; Not My problem tell that to the guy who made it for you&#34;  In a i dont care sort of attitude.  He was making a couple other burritos and there was a  line i wasnt going to hold up the line so that he would say the same but i was furious!

so i paid my 7 bucks  for my burrito and walked out. I got home ate it and was still hungry so i ate a footlong sub from subway. 

Whenever i go to different chipotles my stomach is full. This one its usually the opposite.


Im so upset this chipotle that is so close to me is so unproffesional. Ill just drive to the other one in wheeling from now on. Im not giving my money to these people unless they change which i dont think they will.

I want to mention this is the first yelp review i have ever written. And it is sad to have this be the first but i want change to happen.



once again chipotle food is good just this location makes  it bad!

I guess that makes it understandable why they disliked Chipotle so much.

Chipotle is not Mexican, it&#39;s very Americanized. That being said, it is probably one of the most delicious places in the area. I used to get the popular burritos but got sick of taking one bite full of sour cream, then the next bite of only tortilla and beans, then one of just lettuce..

So, I moved on to a burrito bowl. Best decision ever. Now I can selectively build my bite for the perfect ratio of meat to rice to beans to salsa, etc.

For the Chipotle virgins (doubtful there are any.. it IS 2010!), here&#39;s my rundown on the toppings:

- cilantro/lime rice is great
- can&#39;t go wrong with either choice of beans (black or pinto)
- grilled peppers/onions are OK
- favorite meats are the pork carnitas and the chicken. Both are very tender, moist, and flavorful
- favorite salsa is the mild sweet corn salsa
- guacamole is usually excellent

Who cares if it&#39;s not authentic Mexican.. it&#39;s amazing!"

The steak was more tender than the last time I had it and I always enjoy the salsa. 
 I am appalled by another reviewer, (if you want to call him that) Michael C. is just making things up as his story makes no sense at all. 

&#34;I prefer actual little tiny Mexican restaurants like the ones you find in Chicago&#34; - 
Well looks like you had your mind made up that you wouldn&#39;t like it before you got there buddy.

&#34;And they swear it&#39;s the best. After eating hear once, every time they mention it, I literally squirm just thinking how it tasted.&#34; - Once again no credibility at all, he spells here &#34;hear&#34; and he says every time his buddies mention it he squirms. How is that possible if you hadn&#39;t eaten Chipotle before? You posted one day ago so your timeline doesn&#39;t add up you attention whore. Your grammar is atrocious as well, seriously 7th grade level.

&#34;I got the burrito bowl, and man I never had such horrible tasting meat in my life.&#34; - You are some yelp reviewer. Way to describe that &#34;meat&#34; that you ate, very descriptive considering how many worthless reviews you have.

&#34;How do you F that up.&#34; - You are supposed to end a question with a &#34;?&#34; 

I could go on but whatever. I will mention I am in no way associated with Chipotle and this is an honest review of the unit and Michael C."

This particular joint could use some sound dampers. It&#39;s deafening, and makes for an insufferable lunch &#34;date.&#34; Yes, we could choose to sit outside, but seriously, who wants a view of a bank drive-thru, a Meijer and Golf Road traffic?

This is the 1st time I&#39;ve been to a Chipotle and hailing from Tejas recently, I find the burrito passable for a chain. 

I was inspecting the sufficiently small menu and noticed they even have barbacoa.  I wonder how many people know that true barbacoa is the meat from the cow&#39;s cheek. Lots of people like it for its fattiness, but to me, it&#39;s more of a &#34;Fear Factor&#34; challenge. I called a Chipotle to find out if it is indeed the cow&#39;s cheek. She did not know the answer but offered to call me back once she finds out. AND IT IS NOT THE CHEEK! What customer service!

I had the carnitas burrito. Contrary to Renato&#39;s experience, my braised pork was juicy moist. The cilantro-lime rice was overpowering, and I like my citrus.

Do me a favor: don&#39;t be like that hog who was eating solo but took up the table for four."

This particular Chipotle is my favorite, as every employee that has served me has always been very professional and had a very positive attitude. I will literally drive out of my way to go here, even though there is another one that is closer to my house. If you like the cilantro in the rice but would like some on top, they can do that btw!

I went there tonight and ordered my regular burrito bol.  For whatever reason, the fool behind the counter seemed to be extra skimpy with everything.  Now, normally I wouldn&#39;t care, but the guy behind me ordered the exact same thing, and this time the server piled everything on.  When I got to the front of the line, I ordered a regular drink and paid.  However, when I got the soda fountain, their was no more iced tea.  When I asked the guy up front if he had any in back, he said, &#34;No, but we can make some.&#34;  I said that I didn&#39;t have time to wait, and asked him to refund my drink off my bill, to which he replied, &#34;I can&#39;t do that because you paid with a credit card.&#34;  So I ended up paying an extra $2.00 for a cup of water.  If I wanted miniscule portions and unaccommodating service, I could have gone to Taco Bell.  Do yourself a favor, skip the Chipotle in Rolling Meadows and try the one up the street in Schaumburg.

The meat they make their burritos with came out of a hopper , pre cooked and a bit dry. The veggies inside were alright , but there were whole black beans filling the burrito , not even a bean sauce or refried beans, a hunk of black beans. To be fair the rice and beans were alright , not standout , but alright. I ate my burrito , grudgingly , and didn&#39;t even finish it (that&#39;s big for me). If I don&#39;t finish something for any reason other than being full , it&#39;s probably real bad , it was. I refuse to ever go here again , I later found out it was owned by Mc Donalds , and it shows. 
I also got really sick about 2 hours after eating there , cherry on the top I guess."

The service was IMPECCABLE from the all the planning questions leading up to the event and last minute changes, they were easy to work with and prompt to respond.  They also did a great job setting up our name cards, arranging the tables as requested, providing mics and adjusting volume as needed and refilling the food and drinks whenever they were running low!

The food was AMAZING!!!  The apps, entrees and dessert were all phenomenal!  There wasn&#39;t a single dish that I wasn&#39;t impressed with!  I thought the dinner here was better than our wedding dinner!  Oh and the tasting to book the event was insane!  For the two of us, there was enough food for ten people!  Luckily we got to pack it up and take it all home to eat all week!

Us and all of our guests were very impressed with the rehearsal dinner from the décor, setup, service and food!  Thank you Cooper&#39;s Hawk for making the start of our big weekend so smooth and delicious!  We can&#39;t wait to come back to celebrate our anniversaries!"

My boyfriend and I visited this location on Sweetest Day this year. Very great experience! As we usually never have time to make reservations and wanted to have dinner at Cooper&#39;s Hawk I called around to the different locations. Most locations had 1 hour plus wait times. I called the Arlington Heights location and they had no wait! Not because they&#39;re horrible, but because this location is so extremely large! As every location is, it&#39;s very nice inside and relaxing amongst all the chaos with servers. The ambiance is excellent and simple. 

I ordered a few samples of wine. I believe they usually only give you three if I recall. I am by no means a wine connoisseur so I have no clue what I like other than I like it sweet. I could not find the right wine for ordering a whole bottle, so the server definitely helped in giving extra samples to find the right one. We ordered a bottle $22, which I don&#39;t think is outrageous for amazing quality wine.

We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. I don&#39;t think it was worth it because you get about 8 small slices of chicken and 8 lettuce wraps. We put two pieces of chicken on each wrap and ran out of chicken well before the wraps. We have also had their pork nachos before.  If you&#39;re going for amount of food for the value, I do not recommend these. The nachos you get about 6-8 chips with meat on them. If you ARE going for flavor for your buck, I highly recommend the nachos! The chicken wraps are good as well, I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with any meal here. 

For dinner, my boyfriend had the BBQ Ranch chopped salad and I had the Dana&#39;s Parmesan-Crusted Chicken. The parmesan-crusted chicken was not my favorite, but is by no means horrible. It was a little on the dry side. Being Italian, you like some sauce and extra cheese on your chicken ;). 

Oh, and our server... SOFT TALKER, but it made for an entertaining date when one of us could understand him and one could not."

Overall I am quite happy with my visit. The food was delicious and the service was prompt and friendly. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for. No corners were cut.

For an appetizer we had the drunken Mexican shrimp and the flatbread. Not a fan of the flatbread, mostly personal taste. The shrimp was delicious. I highly recommend it. Just wish they gave you more.

For the meal I had the Parmesan crusted swordfish dinner. I&#39;ve never had swordfish before but they made my first taste special. It was delicious. Came with a side salad and some seasoned potatoes. I didn&#39;t like the salad much but the potatoes complimented the fish perfectly.

For dessert I had the Smore Budino which was basically a smore parfait. Layers of chocolate, graham cracker crust and toasted marshmallow on top. In addition I tried a glass of blueberry wine. I&#39;m not a big fan of wine, but that stuff was really to my liking. I might go back to just buy a bottle one day. 

Overall a wonderful meal in a cozy place. Great place for a date or a business outing. Perhaps not a family endeavor but might be good for older children. I will be sure to visit again if the opportunity allows."

I have already posted a review regarding food and drinks at the Wheeling location and thankfully this location meets all the same standards.  Ideal for group gatherings or solo dates. 

Highly recommend calling in advance to book reservations. Have rarely seen this location not busy and typical wait times can exceed an hour. Luckily, waiting inside a wine place isn&#39;t the worse thing that can happen to someone but needlessly to say reserve yourself a table.

Another tip, make sure to check in your reservation upon arriving. Reservations are only held for 30 minutes and have learned the hard way when waiting for the rest of our party to arrive that our table was given up.

On a closing note,shoutout to the staff members who have always been attentive and very educated on their menu . Never been disappointed coming here for dinner, and well worth the extra splurge!"

Prior to coming here I has made reservations through open table and added a note I was celebrating my birthday, without realizing this my fiancé called to see if he could a dessert or chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our table at the end of the night and the rep mentioned that there was already a note about it and it would be taken care of, perfect.

Upon arriving we were greeted and seated within a few minutes. Our server was friendly and our service was okay. The food was quite delicious. We started with the flavor packed pork belly toastadas, no wonder these are award winning, so yummy! I had the surf and turf, beef medallions and drunken Mexican shrimp while my fiancé went for the filet. You can definitely tell the beef were high quality cuts with the way it just fell a part in your mouth. The drunken Mexican shrimp were okay. The shrimp are small with barely any bacon. We enjoyed both our potato options: chipotle cheddar and Debbie. 

After we were done with our meal the server asked if we would like dessert or coffee. So somewhere along the way there was a miscommunication between our reservation and the server. We were extremely disappointed since Scott had followed up with the host as well. We ended up following up with Chris, the Manager who seemed overwhelmingly busy that he was trying to make it up to us but also get us on our way so he can take care of other diners. We left with a half filled box of sweets. He did mention for us to come back and he&#39;ll do something nice for us, but we will see. 

The 3 stars really comes down to the next day when I ate my leftover the server packed the leftover tails of shrimp that I already ate... kind of disgusting but I guess okay because it&#39;s my own food? Not sure what to think."

I actually received a complimentary meal and glass of wine from last summer. So I finally decided to use it; I was actually going to go back to Naperville,  but this one was closer to where I was. First, this one was huge!  Huge parking lot and tons of space on the inside. We went around 4pm and there was a 15 minute wait, but when we were taken to our table there was a bunch of empty tables so didn&#39;t understand  the wait time??? 

Anyways, the bread is always good. I tried to order something  simple this time because  I didn&#39;t like the jambalaya last time. I ordered a veggie flatbread with the wedge salad which was delicious.  Everyone I went with enjoyed their meal this time too. 

Our server was nice and quick. Now, I mentioned the Naperville location  had a stale/weird smell like you would smell going to a say an Olive Garden or some kid-friendly restaurant where everything  is sticky and gross! This location did not have any smells!!! Very clean! The bathrooms could&#39;ve been better though. 

Don&#39;t know if I would be dying to go back since it&#39;s a glorified chain. The first experience still has jaded me from ordering anything too complicated.  But if I had to choose a location,  I would recommend  this one."

The ambiance is very classy and exquisite. Makes you feel like you&#39;re in an upscale place but just without the upscale prices. Their wine is fantastic. We usually get the flight sampler so you can get a taste of about 6 different wines. It&#39;s very inexpensive. Everything we&#39;ve eaten from there has been good, including the Salmon, fish &amp; chips, and the jambalaya. The portions are also very genroous.

Asian Pork Belly Tostadas
Mexican Drunken Shrimp 
Cap rede Flatbread
Cooper&#39;s Hawk Calamari

Soup - my favorite is the Crab &amp; Lobster bisque

3 of their pastas can be made gluten free which really makes it convenient for my niece 

Dana&#39;s Parmesan Crusted Chicken is super yummy and Ellie&#39;s Chicken Piccata is my second choice
 
Burgers &amp; Sandwiches - The Prime sandwich (to die for) and the Leonard Burger

My niece loves their Soy Ginger Salmon

Meats: I prefer the Maple, Mustard, &amp; Pretzel covered Boneless Pork Chop and Short Rib Risotto

Desserts: everything and the truffles

The best is the Life Balance Menu though. These are my top 4 options - Chicken Pot Stickers, BBQ Ranch Chicken salad, Grilled Tenderloin Medallions, and their Grilled Atlantic Salmon.

I had heard from friends about how great Cooper&#39;s Hawk is and I knew I had to try it. I had to see what all the rave was about. I&#39;m glad I did. 

My friend and I stopped in one evening to enjoy some wine and good food. 
Our first stop was straight to the tasting room. 
The tasting room is a Napa Style tasting room with an open feel. 
Our server, Tim G. did an excellent job introducing me to the Cooper&#39;s Hawk experience. He recommended a few wines to sample and explained the differences between the different wines. 

Keep in mind, I&#39;ve always been a vodka drinker and never developed an appreciation for good wine. Tim changed that. My friend and I enjoyed the wine and chatted it up. We truly had a great time. I enjoyed the wine and ambiance so much that I decided to sign up for the Wine Club. My favorite so far is the Orange Muscat. (January Club Wine)

The Wine Club entitles you to (1 or 2) bottles per month. You also receive some great perks, such as accumulating points and 10% any wine purchase. I get so excited every month when I receive the email from Cooper&#39;s Hawk that reveals the &#34;Exclusive Wine of The Month&#34;. (club members only) 

The food at Cooper&#39;s Hawk is outstanding, as is the service. 
I have gone back numerous times (2-3 times a month) since my first visit. 
My father and I even went to enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner and had a great experience, as usual. For food, I highly recommend starting off with the Potstickers or Pork Belly Tostadas, truly delightful! If you&#39;re in the mood for a sandwich, I always get &#34;The Prime&#34;. Prime Rib piled high on a soft bun with seasoned fries and a side of au jus. Pro Tip: Add Pepperjack Cheese and Jalapeno Bacon!

The service here is impeccable. The wait staff is always quick and responsive. They know their stuff and are happy to recommend food/wine if you&#39;re in the mood to try something new. We especially love the Grapevine Decanter that is set up at the table. We usually share a bottle so it works out great! 

Since my first visit, I can&#39;t stay away! (Good Thing!) 
I enjoy going in and picking up my bottle for the month and shopping around in the tasting room. Christmas shopping was easy this year! Once again, Tim G. exceeded my expectations. He helped me one night when I was looking for a nice gift for my father. My father LOVES wine. I wanted a nice Malbec gift set for him. However, there was not one on the floor. Tim happily assisted me and said he could hand-make one to my liking, complete with two matching wine glasses. 
The gift was made with care and truly perfect! My dad was so happy when he opened it on Christmas morning! 

I can&#39;t say enough good things about Cooper&#39;s Hawk!
If you&#39;re looking for good food, great service, and exceptional wine, don&#39;t hesitate to check out Cooper&#39;s Hawk!"

Pros:

-These are generally very nice venues, great place for a date or event. There really is an element of class at Coopers Hawk

-If you&#39;re a wine buff you&#39;ll be a fan. Promotional offers are a big draw

Cons:

-Dishes on my last visit were surprisingly bland. Granted it was for an event served family style, but flavor was definitely lacking for my level of expectation on such an establishment, and the main reason it gets a 3.

-If you&#39;re not a wine buff, this place will probably lose at least 40% of its charm

-Some people may find the atmosphere a little over the top. The place is huge and strikes me as a little over done, though it  generally doesn&#39;t bother me


Bottom Line:

Not being a wine guy, Cooper&#39;s Hawk really doesn&#39;t talk to me very well, and to be honest my last visit was a disappointment. I&#39;d never go out of my way to come here on my own, but I&#39;m not exactly against it either. This place will get another shot with me in due time."

I love Coopers Hawk, I have been here many times.  Their wedge salad is one of my favorite salads.  The wine is great and having tasting while you wait is wonderful. The problem I have is that my food has just never been that great. It isn&#39;t bad, but I usually don&#39;t leave thinking WOW my food was awesome. Why still 4 stars, you ask?  Because I will keep going back so the charm of the place is definitely there. This visit I had the crab cakes. There were just too many shells. My husband had the filet trio with different crusts and the Betty&#39;s potatoes. Although he enjoyed the filets, the potatoes were mostly bread crumbs. Like I said, the food is just always a little off. In my opinion, if they raised the bar on the food preparation a little, the place would be even more popular than it is. Let&#39;s face it, the place is always packed and reservations must be made in advance so I guess not a ton of motivation is there for food improvements. I will note that our service has always been wonderful and the pretzel bread you get prior to your meal is warm and delicious. Go drink some wine and enjoy your night."

My experiences with this Arlington Heights location have been slightly worse than, say, the South Barrington location. (The South Barrington location would get Four robust stars from me.)  All the wines and their qualities are the same throughout the locations.  But the taste of foods and the quality of their preparation seem to be slightly better in the South Barrington location, which is perhaps it is an older and more experienced establishment.  

I generally like any Cooper&#39;s Hawk&#39;s appetizers and desserts; but their main dishes are usually mediocre to me.  Their wines?--They are just OK to me, and I&#39;m not a wine snob."

I first started coming here more than two years ago after finding out about their gluten free menu at a benefit dinner.  The short rib risotto was amazing, PLUS knowing it was celiac-safe was a combination I fell in love with.  The plethora of wine options only made me love this place more, and it became my go-to for date night or a fancier dinner when I came home to visit family.  But lately, I&#39;ve left feeling super disappointed -- to a point where I&#39;ll probably never come back.

In December, this Cooper&#39;s Hawk, which boasts as not only gluten free but safe for celiacs, gave me an allergic reaction.  The food that night didn&#39;t taste like it normally does.  I don&#39;t know what happened.  But the reaction was so bad and caught me so by surprise that I mentioned it to a manager -- wanting to make sure no one else got sick more than anything else!  But I was met with confrontation and denial while my stomach was puffing up by the minute at the table.  I finally just had to point to my stomach and say, &#34;my stomach does not lie.&#34;  Not cool.  I was offered a card to come back for a free entree, and I swore I wouldn&#39;t use.  I was too scared to risk a reaction like that again, let alone after a $50+ meal. But... six months later, the memory had faded and I decided to give it a shot again.

When I came here for dinner this past week and used that card, while I didn&#39;t have a reaction, the experience was average at best.  They were out of bread (for the gluten eater at my table) and the waiter was brusk and slightly rude.  But what bothered me the most was that the risotto was completely different from how it&#39;d been the last 20 times I&#39;ve had it.  Now, instead of short rib atop a plate of risotto, it was 80% short rib mixed and mangled about 20% of risotto.  Did they run out of risotto too...?  Again, I left feeling like the value wasn&#39;t there.  The food and experience as a whole weren&#39;t what I&#39;d become accustomed to at Cooper&#39;s Hawk.

I used to be a huge fan of this place. I was a wine club member (now cancelled) and I frequently bought wine to take home with me.  It&#39;s still some of the best Cabernet I&#39;ve found in the area. But dining here? Frankly, even supporting this business after how things have been on the last two visits? Eh, I think I have to move on to find a new date-night dinner spot."

Went with the rich lobster bisque soup, Big cup, delicious, LOBSTER.
Chose then to go with two entrees since they came with some veggies, and skipped the salad/flatbread option.

The Salmon had a light teriyaki sauce that wasn&#39;t salty or sweet and had some mustard notes,  about a 6 ounce lunch portion on a bed of creamy rough mashed potatoes with a light fresh cole slaw. Pecan breaded boneless pork was small imo, maybe 4 ounces and was on the same rough mashed potato bed with some light fried onion crisps and some sauteed mushrooms and veggies, nice add to the too small boneless pork plate.
Dessert was a larger than expected dark chocolate or white truffle.
We had leftovers of everything (weren&#39;t that hungry after the soup) even split a truffle. 

The $20 prix fixe included coffee and tea, and service was friendly and helpful. Lots of booth and seating options including private rooms. We had not been to this location b4. Reminds me a lot of the old Chart Houses. This location and corner has had a number of owners.
Give it a try, the restaurant week deal was giving us about a 20-25% discount. Cool.
They are also very good about wine sampling, I like the Barbera when they have it. At the intersection of Golf and Algonquin Road."

Food was good, though the crab cakes were a bit salty and the calamari was too doughy. The parmesan crusted filet medallions were perfect, however, and the accompanied mashed potatoes and veggies were cooked just right. My only complaint is that I mentioned it was my boyfriend&#39;s birthday twice - both when I made the reservation and when the host was seating us, and there was no acknowledgment whatsoever. I expected the server to make note of it and, like most restaurants, bring out a birthday dessert, but nada. Disappointed at the lack of customer service in this regard, but would go back for the tasting room."

The place is very easy to find and there&#39;s tons of parking. I made an OpenTable reservation and had to wait an additional 15 minutes for tables to leave/clear out. 

The atmosphere is very nice and this location seems bigger than their other locations which was nice. It was restaurant week when my friends and I came in. The restaurant week is a $30 pre fix meal (app/salad, main entree, and dessert). I ordered the wedge salad, salmon, and creme brulee. The portions were huge and you really get your monies worth. The wedge salad was made delicious and not too much dressing was on it which was nice. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the wasabi mashed potatoes are amazing. The creme brulee was cooked perfectly as well. It was a nice dinner and I had no problems besides waiting longer even though I had a reservation. 

I would come back to this location and advise everyone to do the restaurant week if they still have it going."

Let&#39;s start with the staff (the wine is always a HIT OF COURSE!)  They were so nice and helpful!  I had a reservation but my friend was taking FOREVER ... so i decided to go to the wine counter for a &#34;taste&#34; :)  The lady at the counter greeted me with a smile and proceeded to take my order.  I wanted to try something new and she helped me do just that.  She asked about my tastes and all of the of the probing questions to get to a suggestion that may fit me and my palate best!  Yup... her suggestion was on point!

While standing their i realized, goodness I forgot to check in at the hostess stand.  I walked over, with my wine of course :) explained my situation (my reservation time had passed 30 minutes ago!)  He said no worries, I will see what I can do and come grab you from the wine counter.. he did just that!  Just in time for my friend&#39;s arrival.  

After being escorted to the table, the waiter was right on time.  He was very attentive and helped us with the ordering process.  We were there primarily for wine and appetizers.  After speaking with him he suggested the pitcher of Sangria Red! It was AMAZING!! 

We also decided on ordering the Egg Rolls!!! Holy Rolled Heaven!  They tasted great!  

I enjoyed my visit and i will definitely be back.. SOON! NO REALLY.. i have a reservation for tonite!"

I had the shaved Brussel sprout salad and it was to the moon good!  So fresh and tasty. The blend of flavors in the veggies, cheese, vinaigrette and almonds was sheer perfection.  

The carne asada flatbread was also a wise choice. The only thing that kept it from perfection was the lack of steak. I knew it wouldn&#39;t be &#34;loaded&#34; but a little taste in each bite would have been nice.  It was crispy, full of flavor and beautifully presented. But it did leave me asking &#34;where&#39;s the beef?&#34;

My true knock was the lifeless hostess who appeared pissed that she didn&#39;t work for Alinea. No eye contact, no real verbal exchange a total drip.   Thank God the  hostess who showed us to our table had a personality.

One, it is cheap: $7 for the basic tasting (8 wines) or $10 for a bit of a different experience. We went with the $7 option. We tasted 4 whites, 3 reds, and a dessert white sangria. We were very well taken care of by the servers, who were all very nice and helpful. 

The 3 star rating comes because, frankly, Cooper&#39;s Hawk is the Starbucks of wineries. The wine itself was bland: all the whites tasted the same and all the reds tasted the same. That doesn&#39;t make them bad; in fact, they were decent or decently good wines. But there was no variety. I couldn&#39;t distinguish anything special about the wines I was tasting. And when I got home I uncorked some Montepulciano wine from Trader Joe&#39;s, which I thought was much better than anything I had at Cooper&#39;s Hawk. 

Cooper&#39;s Hawk, it felt to me, is trying too hard to be something it isn&#39;t. It is not a winery in the strict sense, no matter how much it wants to be, and the wine it does produce is focused more on mass production as opposed to quality, in my opinion (I&#39;m sure the corporate folks would vehemently dispute this). The product is akin to Starbucks&#39; Pike Place roast coffee: a non-offensive, mass appealing product that doesn&#39;t take anyone outside their palate&#39;s comfort zone. 

That said, I didn&#39;t try the restaurant or any of the food there (except a Bailey&#39;s truffle, which was tasty). I looked at the menu and it looked pretty good, and fairly priced. Maybe my review would change if I went to the restaurant part of Cooper&#39;s Hawk. But based just on the wine tasting, this place is a solid 3. 

It&#39;s a good deal and it&#39;s something nice to do. I just wouldn&#39;t do it regularly."

A beautiful restaurant/winery with delicious food and great classical music- what more could I ask for in a family dinner? 

Drinks: I tried a sparkling rose and the sunset punch. They are known for their large selections of wine, and if you order a bottle of red wine it comes in a huge wine aerator pourer thing- really cool.

Mediterranean shrimp salad: a little too olive-y for my taste but otherwise very fresh and light so perfect for an appetizer salad to share! 

Surf and turf: salmon and filet medallion were the perfect choices for this dish. There was a little too much sauce on the salmon, but the Parmesan crusted filet medallion was very delicious and tender. Cooked perfectly medium rare. The roasted veggies and potatoes were also a great pairing to the dish. 

Other dishes ordered at the table: blackened ahi tuna (mmmmm so so good!), grouper (another excellent seafood dish), and strip steak (I personally liked the filet better).

Dessert: birthday dessert had a nice fudge truffle (perfectly rich) and chocolate covered strawberry. How delightful! 

Such a beautiful dinner. It took a while for the food, but I imagine it is because the dishes were made from scratch. Wonderful gift shop to browse through with wine tasting available also."

We started with wine tasting. There are two options. The standard monthly sheet and the sweet wines. You are allowed to taste 8 wines and you can combine different wines from each sheet for a total of 8 wines. The prices is $7 which is a great price. 

They serve what I think was pretzel bread and butter as you are seated it comes hot and ready to munch. 

One must try the egg rolls. I totally forgot to take a picture but they are plentiful (6 or 7) on the plate with an Asian slaw and three sauces all are fantastic. 

I didn&#39;t find it to be over priced but the wine like at any restaurant is expensive which is why we ordered sangria to get the most bang for our buck. 

For my entree I ordered the Dana&#39;s chicken that came with a side of cheesy potatoes, and garlic green beans. I loved every bite and had enough to take home for the next day. 

I was not in the mood for steak so I decided to skip it. But I hear it is really good from this place!

Skipped desert because we were too full. I did see another table order desert all of which looked delightful. 

My only negative was the parking. At peak times it is difficult and be prepared to walk. There are enough spaces but the parking lot is large and it is a distance if you get stuck far away from the entrance.  

Please try this place at least once."

Barrington, I was excited to see how this location compared. Replacing one of my favorite restaurants (Pappadeaux), I had to be sure this standardfor CH kept.

I dined for lunch on my birthday. Beautiful interior, in a 360 degree fashion. Perfect setting for a nicer lunch or dinner. Prices for lunch run about $12-$15 a plate, where the nicer dinner or larger plates are anywhere from $20-$30. 

My typical pick: 8 oz. filet mignon with a parmesan crust, broccoli, and Mary&#39;s potatoes. I ask for horseradish cream sauce- and without problems, they oblige. My steak is always cooked at a perfect medium. A marriage of a seasoned flavor on the outside, with a juicy, tender-pink inside.

Wine. Oh, the wine. you can sample one, sample many  (in a flight of 4), or even become a diehard fan, and opt for the wine club. CH allows you to sample 4 glasses before committing to one. Wide range, from moscato, to sangria, whites,  reds, sparkling, and dessert wines. They&#39;ve even got moscato (although I prefer d&#39;Asti). You really can&#39;t go wrong. 

My personal wine favorites are the sweet sparkling red, ice wine, and the night jar. But my tastes lean towards sweet, or rich. The pinot noir comes in a regular and a luxe edition.

Service is always impeccable. Friendly, knowledgable, and usually some eye candy for waiters.

I have to give it a 5-star review, because it&#39;s a place I keep coming back to for more. I&#39;ve had cheese plates, appetizers like the tostadas.. even the complimentary bread is amazing. a favorite dessert of mine is the banoffee pie, which is like an adult banana pudding on a graham cracker crust, with a mix of toffee, caramel, and whip cream. For a lighter dessert, you can do a medley of chocolate covered strawberries (there&#39;s a varying selection).

Start-to-finish, nothing I&#39;ve had has ever disappointed. On top of that, they are consistent.

I tried it out again this past week, I didn&#39;t leave as satisfied as I was hoping for. To begin with, this place was PACKED, especially for a Tuesday evening. The wait for 2 of us was 1-1.25 hours. We ended up finding a seat at the bar area right away, so that was nice. We started off with some wine and warm pretzel bread. I love love love the pretzel bread here, especially when its served hot from the oven. I could probably make an entire meal from it, some butter, cheese and wine. Their wine selection is definitely great, and I always enjoy trying their different options. Regarding the food, we tried the butternut squash enchiladas this time - I wasn&#39;t very impressed. There also seemed to be  chunks of ginger in the mix, which overtook any other flavor in the dish. The side salad of mixed vegetables was good and I enjoyed it. The Caesar pesto salad is always delicious, and the caprese flatbread is at par level with most caprese flatbreads that you can get at most places (nothing out of the ordinary). The service is great, but with how busy it gets, it can be slow at times."

The basement dining room is nicely decorated with wine barrels attached to the walls and roomy enough for several round tables. And there&#39;s nice bar area with plenty of room for several high top tables.

But the highlight was the delicious food. Our newlywed hosts made excellent choices from the menu...salmon and beef filets. The food was served family style, so there was plenty of it.

Both were fantastic!

The dinner was small: 3 of us girls, a bottle of wine poured in the fancy schmancy decanter, and a couple appetizers and a salad to split. The Cooper&#39;s Hawk Red is affordable and good. For $22.99 a bottle, not bad at all! I forgot which flatbread we got, but it was pretty good and went well with the BQQ Ranch Chicken Salad that I got. I don&#39;t normally order an entree sized salad, but the week previous to this dinner, I had been eating a lot of meat and carbs. My body needed some veggies :P

The private birthday party in the upstairs loft area was great for our group of 20+. The appetizers were served on a table to munch on with your glass of (red or white) wine. The food was served family style, as a 4 course dinner ($28.99) and then unlimited wine ($15.99). For around $55-60 per person, not bad at all! I think I just liked the unlimited wine part of it ;)"

Walking in I did not realize this was a chain establishment, as so I was immediately impressed with the set up and atmosphere. Everything is very slick, you see.

Once you come through the doors you enter a fairly large room with wine, wine accessories and other items which would make great gifts. The dining room itself is dimly lit and tastefully decorated. Despite the high ceilings the noise level is low. 

The menu consists of dishes with a recommended wine pairing alongside it, the wine recommendation refers to a particular bin and of that bin you make your choice of libation. 

I started out with a blanc de blanc as aperitif, it was crisp, dry and I really enjoyed it. Our friends ordered the chicken potstickers and pork belly tostadas for the table. I loved (with a capital L) the tostadas. The pork belly was tender soft and it&#39;s pairing with fresh sliced avocado made the little bites perfectly creamy and addictive. The potstickers were pan-fried and served alongside a flavorful coleslaw.

I had trouble deciding on my main course as most items on the menu sounded wonderful. I opted for the short rib risotto, served with earthy mushrooms, fresh parmesan shavings and white truffle oil. The short rib was braised perfectly- it was fork tender and it made me a very happy diner. All of us ordered meat so we enjoyed a bottle of cab to accompany our meals. The bottle was poured into a very cool (and effective) table aerator. 

All of the wines are their own, the grapes are grown and processed just for them. They have numerous restaurants throughout the Chicago area and throughout the country, if I&#39;m ever near one again I will definitely stop for lunch or dinner without hesitation."

He was arrogant. He actually told me not to eat so many vegetables!! Not joking! Whut???? I know it was family style but maybe I like vegetables??? A waiter telling the customer what to eat and not eat??? Unbelievable. I would describe him as medium height, normal weight, dark complexioned, and with a trimmed narrow beard and greased back hair.

The first time I ate there, unfortunately, he was also the waiter. His attitude hadn&#39;t changed, as the first time he left a most nasty impression as a snobby, too busy to serve you, general jerk attitude who didn&#39;t hold back on telling you what he felt. Sadly, I would have to say that twice his strong lasting impression ruined my overall experience at Cooper&#39;s Hawk. To say nothing that there wasn&#39;t anything outstanding about the food."

We went during the lunch hour on a Saturday and were seated right away.

Our server (Raul M.) was excellent.

Our appetizer (calamari) was outstanding as were the entrees (turkey burger and pork chop).

We asked to split a dessert.  They served the dessert on two separate plates with the garnishes appropriately split between the two plates, which I thought was a very nice touch.  Most other places, when we ask to split the dessert, just bring one dessert and two plates and make us split it ourselves.

Overall, a very good first impression and I hope to return soon."

They(my parents) knew it would be immediate family but the aunts/uncles/grandparents were supposed to be a surprise. So, we made a reservation for 7:00 dinner, we all arrived on time, ten minutes early.... checked in with the hostesses and waited.... we asked the hostesses how much longer our table will be, since it was already 7:15, she replied with &#34;not much longer&#34;.....then we waited some more... and we waited and waited..... Needless to say the surprise wasn&#39;t such a surprise when my parents walked in and saw everyone waiting in the lobby, and then they got to wait with us some more! 55 minutes passed and were finally sat. It didn&#39;t seem like there was any reason why we had to wait almost an hour PAST our reservation... especially with my grandmother who is 86 years old.... When we were(finally) sat, our server apologized  for our wait and she even gave us a few appetizers on the house. The food was good. I had the tuna and tried some of a few other dishes. Service was good too. I just don&#39;t understand why such a large establishment would make a reservation wait an hour AFTER their reservation... what is the point of reserving a table? Anyways, just because of this first and probably last experience, I will not be back. There are so many more places I would much rather spend my money for great food AND great service.

I work in the industry and I understand that the restaurant cannot always control when tables get up, things happen, which is why I would&#39;ve been okay with a 20 or even *gasp* 30 minute delay.. but an hour?? no thanks.

If you care to learn the details, then keep reading.

FIRST TRIP: I&#39;m obligated to give them one (1) star.

SUMMARY: Our lunch meal arrived extremely late, making us late, it was way under cooked (raw), and the customer service was muddled. 

EXPLAINATION:
Our waitress took forever to greet us, but eventually took our order--a hamburger (medium) and chicken sandwich. Our beverages eventually came and then ran out, but weren&#39;t ever refilled. After 35-minutes of waiting (post order), our food also never came! We saw other people who had arrived after us eating!

So, I finally got up and went to the hostess (our server was still M.I.A.). It was a weekday and lunch time, and we had somewhere to go! I explained to the hostess what was going on (or not going on), and she just asks me, &#34;Where are you sitting?&#34; 

First off, there was no apology, and secondly, the place is huge, so, how was I supposed to answer her? Nonetheless, I kept my mouth shut and said, &#34;I can show you.&#34;

The manager then came and said they gave our plates to the wrong table. She did apologize and said they would re-cook our meals, which would arrive in &#34;4-minutes.&#34; Even so, by now we were in such a mad rush, I said we needed them &#39;to go.&#39; Five minutes later, our boxed lunches finally arrived. To their credit, the manager did comp the entire meal and gave us a free desert and free appetizer vouchers. So, everything was free, which we appreciated, but now we were late to work.

So, I now had to eat my burger on my drive and it was nearly raw. They must have flash fried it, because everything was falling apart, soggy, it was so rare and bloody. Therefore my lunch for the day was table-bread and soggy French Fries (from blood in the box) . I couldn&#39;t eat the raw burger; it was just way too rare. I was NOT happy!

SECOND TRIP:
This visit was much different, perhaps because it wasn&#39;t so busy or because they knew we had our vouchers. I don&#39;t know, but we received our meals in a normal, timely fashion. The appetizers (which were free from the coupons) were very good. Our servers were attentive and responsive.

All in all, visit number two was uneventful. The food was better than average for what you would expect. 

I gave Cooper&#39;s Hawk a second chance, because the ambiance really is nice and the manager from our first trip seemed truly concerned about us. They also have a huge wine selection, which I still have yet to try. The decanters look fun, as they are huge and hold a whole bottle dangling over the table in a glass. So, I would still give them another chance.

Overall rating for these two very different experiences is three (3) stars."

I&#39;ve been to several locations in my Midwest travels, and I like that I get consistent quality and great service each and every time I visit this establishment.

The house sauvignon blanc has become my go-to choice here. However, I&#39;ve tried some of the other whites, reds, and seasonals; and have enjoyed most of those as well. The gnocci carbonara is also my go-to dish, for no reason other than carbonara, when done right, is the most relaxing sauce in the world. I catch myself making &#34;mmm&#34; sounds while I eat this dish, and neighboring tables probably think I&#39;ve lost my marbles.

Once in a blue moon, I allow myself to order the banana bread ice cream sandwich, and only when there is a gym available to me within the next 24 hours. This is one of the most delectable things I&#39;ve ever eaten, and the reason I have to buy bigger pants every year."

When we arrived for our 7:15 reservation, we waited about 10 minutes to get seated. There was a wine tasting area by the front desk, even though we did not take advantage of it, it seemed like people were really enjoying it. 

Once the six of us got seated, the waitress immediately came over. She was very friendly and knowledgeable about the dinner menu and the wine list. My sister is part of the wine club, and she had a free bottle for January, so she ordered the sauvignon blanc. They didn&#39;t end up finishing the whole bottle, but she was able to get it re-corked and take the rest home. 

Throughout the night the service was good and the atmosphere of the whole restaurant was great. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food that they ordered. I decided to go with the Life Balance Sea Scallops, which were served over a mediterranean sweet grape tomato relish, oven-roasted cauliflower, and fresh basil. The dish was really light and very savory. I would definitely get it again. However, the relish was a little bit onion heavy, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anyone who does not like onions. 

At the end of the dinner, the waitress brought a cute dessert for my sister with a candle, which consisted of some chocolate covered strawberries and some truffles. 

Overall, we had a great experience and my sister had a wonderful birthday. We would definitely go back again!"

I can&#39;t believe I walked in there to do a tasting and ended up with a two bottle club. Very enticing very very enticing you get two free tastings per month by being a two club to bottle club member. The prices are reasonable about 20 bucks for a bottle of wine and they have ports how cool is that?

I met some girls there for dinner and we started off with a couple of tastings and got a nice glass of Malbec. Paired well with my vegetarian dish. Yum. 

I wasn&#39;t 100% thrilled with my dinner but it was a veggie night for me so I should just go with something different next time. I had the black bean veggie burger with jalapeno cheeseburger toppings. Without the meat  they bunned with lettuce instead of bread, so was good, it just was really crumbly, it&#39;s falling apart so I had to eat it with a fork; a  burger cannot be eaten with a fork.

My girlfriend also was doing veggie entrée and hers was really good and my other friend really enjoyed her dinner. It&#39;s a must visit place it&#39;s really cool it&#39;s is really fun and oh so casual in a good way. 

My goodness my other favorite winery, you have some competition people! 

Did I tell you that they walk around with trays of additional wine for you to taste, yeah, way cool. You could totally get wasted in this place just by walking around, really!

We had a great experience with the wine member event. The only thing I would recommend is to extend time for servers a bit more so they have time to refill glasses and serve food. The barrel room holds many people and having only one person go around to fill glasses is not enough. Our table did remind them we were still waiting and someone at the table even suggested to leave two bottles at the tables... Not a bad idea! Food was delish!

It was overall a fantastic experience. Their event coordinating staff was a pleasure to work with. They made the experience very easy and were flexible and accommodating to the type of night we were trying to plan. 

The serving staff that we had was truly above par. Our head waiter was attentive, friendly, and very professional. He helped make our night very special for our employees.

As always, the food and drink was delectable. This was our first year hosting at Cooper&#39;s Hawk and the staff feedback was all very positive. I look forward to doing many more events with their team."

Went in for a weekday lunch, so I&#39;ll start by saying I didn&#39;t get to have any wine!

I had to settle for an Arnold Palmer which was delish....perfect blend and sweetness of iced tea and lemonade! Very refreshing. 

Appetizers: YOU HAVE TO GET THE CALAMARI!!!!! It&#39;s probably the best i&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s got a great Asian fusion and the dipping sauce is so yummy!!!

My entree was the parmesan crusted chicken with giardinera...SO GOOD!!! It came with mashed potatoes which were so creamy! The giardinera was perfectly spiced as well...not too over the top and not bland....perfect amount of heat! 

I enjoyed every aspect of this meal and can&#39;t wait to go back and try other items off the menu!"

I like this location a lot better than South Barrington - not nearly as crowded, better parking situation, and easier to get a table.

We did the wine tasting first. It&#39;s $7 per person for 8 tastings. I really like Cooper Hawk&#39;s wine. It&#39;s pretty reasonably priced for how good it is. We then went to a table and ordered the cheese plate and a bottle of wine. I really like how they bring the wine aerator/dispenser to the table when you order a bottle. The cheese plate is really good. We each ordered a different entree. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had anything here I didn&#39;t like. I really like the lobster bisque. Our waitress was even nice enough to split a cup between the 3 of us.

The service was great throughout the entire meal. My parents were really impressed, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they beg to come back some day :)"

A few of my friends mentioned this place when it first opened up near our house but we never bothered to check it out. Then we saw it featured on an episode of Check Please and thought it was interesting so we made a reservation on Valentines Day no less. 

When we arrived we participated in the Wine Tasting which anyone can try at the front of the restaurant. My husband and I love red wine but are not very knowledgeable so the tasting was definitely worth the time. We tasted 8 different wines and were given tips and notes on the best foods to pair with each wine. 

We had such a great time our server Ron offered the membership to us. You can become a member and get free wine tastings and bottles of wine every month for a membership fee. You also rack up points for money spent on dining and can redeem the points for a reward towards your bill. 

When the wine tasting was finished we were taken to our reserved table and enjoyed a delicious meal. Typically when you visit a winery the food isn&#39;t up to par but the food here is excellent. They have something for everyone but my staple is the Short Rib Risotto which is sublime. 

I would recommend taking anyone here from a Girls night out, or a romantic dinner, even a business lunch. Cooper&#39;s Hawk has an appealing and sexy atmosphere so leave the kiddies at home to enjoy a night of fun for the adults."

What started out as a wonderful evening with a tasting for 6 hosted by Kate (she is adorable and friendly and so down to earth!) turned into a night of jaw-dropping comments, eye rolling and general lack of respect from our server, Chrissy. Things started out okay as we ordered a bottle for the table, but then quickly went downhill from there.
1. Chrissy came around to ask if we had settled on any appetizers, to which I said, &#34;No, I think we&#39;ll just have the bread.&#34; When I said this, she rolled her eyes and said, &#34;YEAH, I&#39;ll bring the bread.&#34; My guests and I were appalled.
2. When she came back for our orders, I told her, &#34;I&#39;m going to do a couple smaller plates for dinner (the soup, shrimp and side of fries).&#34; To make pacing easier for her I said, &#34;I guess the soup can come out first&#34; to which she snobbily replied, &#34;I KNOW. I think I&#39;ve done this before!!&#34; Seriously?! Sorry for trying to make things easier for YOU. 
3. One of my guests needed a refill on his beer (which she hadn&#39;t been coming to check in on) so he said, &#34;Excuse me, ma&#39;am, can I please have a refill on this?&#34; Chrissy immediately shot back, &#34;YEAH. I GOT it. And don&#39;t call me ma&#39;am!&#34; And then walked away. When she came back, she told him again, &#34;Don&#39;t call me ma&#39;am, I&#39;m too old for ma&#39;am. Call me miss.&#34; (She was, I&#39;m guessing, in her 40&#39;s? And his use of ma&#39;am was out of kindness, not disrespect.)
4. When our food came, it was quite some time before she came back to check in. We had to tell her that my fries NEVER came. When she brought them, she set them down and told me, &#34;I&#39;m sorry about that ma&#39;am.&#34; REALLY? You make such a stink over someone calling YOU ma&#39;am, but then you call ME, a woman in her 20&#39;s, ma&#39;am?!?&#34; 
5. She came around and asked if anyone wanted coffee, which we said no. Granted, it appeared that one of our guests was in mid-conversation with another, and he didn&#39;t hear her. When she came around again, he said, &#34;I&#39;d like to order some coffee please&#34; to which she said, &#34;Where were you when I offered?&#34;
After that, she must&#39;ve realized that her job requires her to work for tips, because she was very polite around the time that the check came. She never once asked if we were wine club members, or if we wanted to be (which we are, and have been, loyally, for the past 3 years.) I don&#39;t know if she was a transplant from the recently closed Ed Debevic&#39;s, where customers PAID to get treated like garbage, or if her personality truly IS that foul. Either way, my recommendations for the &#34;improvement specialists&#34; are to have a nice, long, talk with Chrissy about the way she is representing your company."

Food- We started off with the Thai lettuce wraps and the prosciutto bruschetta.  The Thai lettuce wraps were good, crisp romaine lettuce and an array of sauces to dip in.  But the real star here was the bruschetta...    Oh.  My.  Gosh.  Literally on my top three best things I&#39;ve ever eaten list.  It came with arugula, prosciutto, mozzarella, ricotta, sundried tomato, and as always balsamic.  Every bite was creamy and the fattiness of the prosciutto blended with the creaminess of the cheese to make a heavenly combination.  For dinner I had the surf and turf with filet medallions and bacon wrapped shrimp.  It came with rich mashed potatoes which were smooth as butter and delicious.  The shrimp was nicely cooked and tasted great, even though the bacon was a bit overpowering.  The filet medallions came with a succulent steak butter on top.  I had to scrape a tad off because I was already so full from the apps.  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium and was seasoned nicely.  There was also a thin but prominent layer of au jus on the bottom of the plate that served as a sauce for any bite that needed a flavor boost.  I also tried a bit of the classic cheeseburger which was cooked medium well (as requested by another member of the party) but was still seasoned well enough that it held a good flavor.  

Service- Very polite and free refills on soda and iced tea.  

Atmosphere- Upscale but doesn&#39;t feel fancy.  I was still in my beach clothes and I didn&#39;t feel too underdressed.  

Would recommend to anyone in the area and I would make a special trip to go again."

It is not surprising because after when you in side interior makes you immediately feel good and warm. High quality interior helps this feeling remain before you go out from there.  If you like wine, you will feel like in heaven May enormity of selections and it is really to choose from so many flavors of wine. if it comes about food you pay for what you get, and the place to cheap does not belong.

If you happen to be stranded in the NW burbs and don&#39;t want to venture out to the big city, this place is a solid &#34;C&#34;. 
The wine selection is wide, and the quality decent.  We have bounded about quite a bit on the list and recommend the red blend.  Blended wines have a way of nicely mixing the grapes such that they average out to a good wine that should offend no one. Kind of like what Budweiser did for beer- not too hop not too malt, but just right. 
I think their short ribs are really good.  Slow cooked and tender, with a nice wine reduction sauce. They have to be a calorie killer as they rest upon some buttery, creamy mashed potatoes.  
The Asian glazed salmon also was good.  Fish was cooked perfectly on temperature.  Sauce was lil sugaray for me, but still solid. 
Our server had one speed.....ssssslllloooowww, but it was a Saturday night and I got the impression it might have been his first big night.  They don&#39;t seem to have runners or bussers, so in think this dude had to do everything.  Dirty dishes sat in front of the diners way too long and the water glasses ran dry on occasion.  
Finally, the tile floor exiting the kitchen into the dining area seemed slick with a film of kitchen grease.  I almost killed myself heading back from the loo."

Went with friends for wine tasting and dinner.  One section of the wine tasting bar was open, but full.  We inquired if the middle small section could accommodate us and we were told no.  We waited approximately ten minutes and we then were told by Trina that the couple in front of us were on their last tasting.  Not.  We stood and witnessed them be served three more selections.  At that time we decided we had either been lied to or the person was not capable of making good decisions.  We left.  I personally have no interest in returning.

It was a business gathering for a small group of four, and because we weren&#39;t in a hurry it took longer than we planned...but it didn&#39;t seem to take that long.

fyi: I am not a wine expert, but it was interesting to be surrounded by them...and their wine...big barrels of wine!

Started with a flute of Almond Sparkling wine.  Whoa, that stuff is good!  I could have had a whole bottle of that, but alas, I was driving (I should have called a taxi!)  

Had the Caesar salad while munching on their house bread.  Both were enjoyable.
For the main course I had the scallops which were also very tasty. (I rarely meet a scallop I don&#39;t like!)  The scallops were paired with a glass of Viognier. Worked for me!

Finished with this crazy good warm Reese-cup cookie in a skillet with vanilla ice cream on top.  And yes, I do try to gain weight in the winter!

Overall a very pleasant dining experience.  The guys that took us out also bought us all a bottle of wine to take home...gee, maybe I should open that tonight..."

I&#39;d read it was greasy, and with menu items such as The Heart Attack, Doomsday Dogs, The Charlie Sheen and The Ricky Bobby I knew I should stay FAR.AWAY. 

They put gyro meat on burgers. Mac n cheese on buns. Country fried steak and gravy ON TOP OF a beef patty. I mean this place is like THE ULTIMATE hangover food and I just can&#39;t bring myself to eat it when I have to return back to the office and try to function like an adult. 

However, the intern guys at work (bless their hearts) invited me and I decided I&#39;d try a chicken sandwich- Blue Buffalo. I was glad it was grilled, not fried. It was good but it had jalapenos and it was then I&#39;d realized I had made a mistake. Why, you ask? I love jalapenos, but... 

Canned jalapenos? Really? Who are you kidding, Fatt Mustard? Booooo. Boo I say. 

You got some points back with the tots. I&#39;ll be back but only because these interns are good kids and I enjoy an occasional lunch with them.

If nothing else the menu will give you a good laugh- http://www.fattmustard.com/menus/menu.pdf

This isn&#39;t one of those places. We were persuaded by the reviews and the pretty pictures, but when all is said and done, this is just a regular local hot dog joint. They try to put some interesting things on their dogs, and sandwiches, but overall it&#39;s just average stuff you could make at home. Their big claim to fame seems to be the Fat Sauce, which tastes almost exactly like Red Robin&#39;s Campfire Sauce. 

What they do is fine. We ordered a couple of chili dogs that had mac &#39;n cheese on top, with bacon and whatnot. There wasn&#39;t really anything special about them. They tasted fine. They looked fine. They were fine. 

Don&#39;t take this review the wrong way. If I lived in the area and was craving a hot dog, I&#39;d definitely come back. But I wouldn&#39;t make it a destination stop again. In fact, this is going to be a short review because it&#39;s just simple stuff. 

Service was prompt and friendly. Presentation was fine. Taste was fine. 

It&#39;s just not stand up and shout, eat here every week delicious. And that&#39;s okay."

Unless, of course, you are there for the breakfast (which I cannot write about because I have never been there earlier than 11 AM- but they serve breakfast all day!). 

You just need to order any kind of burger they offer, and the Fatt Fries. It&#39;s really what they excel at. They have enough variety and toppings to satisfy anyone&#39;s weird cravings, and the Fatt Sauce you can put on your fries and feel really bad about yourself afterwards, because you know it was like eating 2000 calories all at once (JUST THE FRIES). But damn does it taste good. 

One time, (at band camp) I ordered a salad here. It came out almost as large as the tray itself. This is obnoxiously large, and I think the employees decided if anyone came here and wanted to act all sanctimonious about being &#34;healthy&#34; they would give them an entire head of iceburg lettuce with a ton of toppings to show them another way they can get to 1000 calories while thinking they are being healthy. 

Another time, I had a special- grilled chicken with buffalo sauce, blue cheese crumbles, all on flat bread with fatt fries. Again, this was a winner. I couldn&#39;t even finish 1/3 of my fries. The portions are huge. 

Just as a side note, parking here is kind of busy, so aim for the side parking lot so you don&#39;t hit anyone on your way in or out of the one way channel along the front of the restaurant."

I love a restaurant that puts a twist on things. Now, before eating the breakfast here, I had tried a panini because it was a free lunch thanks to my workplace. Plus, I was new to the area and didn&#39;t know many restaurants in the proximity. The sandwiches are good; Greasy, but good. The fries are in fact fresh cut, but they&#39;re more like fry nuggets because most of them are so small. In my opinion, the lunch food is average at best. 

Back to breakfast: They have an amazing opportunity to make some bomb breakfast food. Considering they open at the crack of dawn and close just after lunch, they need to make desayuno a priority. You can order it all day, with an exception of a few items. Again, their breakfast is simply average. The omelets usually don&#39;t come out fully cooked. I&#39;ve gotten pieces of egg whites that are still gooey-nasty and personally gross me out (haha). I am sorry to say this, but they&#39;re hashbrowns suck. They are completely undercooked and have no flavor what-so-ever. I understand that they are simply potatoes, but throw some spices on those suckers! Even asking for them well-done doesn&#39;t change anything; Trust me, I&#39;ve asked for them EXTRA well done. I would suggest swapping the hash out with tots, if you enjoy crispy tators like myself. 

On a more positive note, they&#39;re country fried steak is to die for. It&#39;s delicious, fresh, and smothered in white country gravy. If you were to get breakfast there, go for the CFS, no questions asked.

In the end, it&#39;s all like I said: Just average. And greasy. With horrible hashbrowns. Do I suggest trying it out? Sure, why not. Would I make it a point of interest if you&#39;re in town? Mehhh, probably not. Though, to each their own, right?"

Sadly, they are not ON Devon, so it&#39;s hard to tell they are even there. Being that a Fastsigns franchise is in their same strip, you would think they would have more signage at the corner of Devon and Tonne (wood dale) to direct people. 

Fries are stupendous. I just wish they weren&#39;t as chopped up as they are; they are kinda hard to eat. But they really are yummy. I&#39;m not much for fries, so for me to say they are good, is a compliment.

Service is great. The staff is fast and accommodating. 

The place is clean. And if u know me, you know I like clean.

You can&#39;t really go wrong here, there&#39;s definitely something for anyone.  A friend of mine who works nearby turned me on to this place, and since then I&#39;ve insisted on bringing several other friends in to try it, and not one of them disliked it.  

Keep an eye on the hours, they&#39;re closed Sundays and close at 3 every other day.  It is probably a good thing this place isn&#39;t open late, otherwise I could see myself making several post-midnight treks here to wrap up long nights of partying."

This place is amazing.  The amount of items is incredible.  The cheeseburgers come with a nice warm bun and they are a very nice size burger.  The serve breakfast everyday at anytime, I love breakfast!  Breakfast for lunch is awesome.

My double bacon cheeseburger was eh, okay. The meat was more bland than anticipated, since they boast about it being their own and being made fresh daily. And the bacon? I was not a fan. Seemed kinda cheap and thin. 

The fries... not sure what all the raving is about, I got mostly tiny little pieces that I had to spear mass quantities of onto a fork just to dip in ketchup... where all the pieces then fell off the fork and into the ketchup. Gave up and tossed them, mostly the whole bag. They were a bit undercooked anyway. You&#39;d think those tiny little pieces would have fried up fast. 

For $10, I can do a 3/4 lb burger at Dino&#39;s in Glendale Heights. And the fries are included. I will say, Fatt Mustard has the best burger in a 5 mile radius of my job. Unfortunately, as most burgers suck around my job, that&#39;s not a huge claim to fame."

Review - Fatt Mustard

Food - My Fav was def the fries!  They are fresh cut fries, lets say it again bc sometimes peps cant tell the difference.  They server FRESH cut fries.  You can tell the difference trust me!  And the fries are good!!  They serve you more than enough too, but on a cold day who doesnt mind putting back a fried greasy potatoe or two.  lol  When you walk into the place the line dividers are jugs of veg oil.  Kinda funny but kinda gross when you think about it...

Other than their fries, its a typical burger and hot dog joint that get creative on a few menu items.  I ordered the Charlie Sheen it was a burger w/ grilled onions, bacon, jalepenos, hot sauce (franks red hot), and american cheese.  Basically it sounds like a heart burn waiting to happen if you are old, out of shape, and married.  lol  Well Im none of those so I ate it w/ a smile on my face.  :)  Decent burger I would have like to see the burger have some thickness but its one of those burgers that are thin and get that nice crisp from the flat top.   

Decor and Service - They have the cheezy hidden sexual sayings, which I always enjoy reading on the walls all over the place.  Besides that it appears to be a husband n wife duo running the joint very nice people and handle the crowds quite well!  It was lunch by myself so nothing that humurous could happen. lol"

the service on the other hand was terrible.

Me looking at menu and trying to decide what I would like when a employee , I wouldn&#39;t say yelled but forcefully asked me if I was ready to order and I responded I am still looking at the menu and she dismissed me quickly to talk with another employee that was sitting at the pick up window on break I guess.

I was ready to place my order and I walked up toward the register and the employee was still chatting with the other employee and I guess she wasn&#39;t ready to take my order until she was finished talking . I placed my order for the &#34; heart attack &#34; burger  and proceeded to pay , after  she took the order she basically threw my receipt and change into my hand and quickly walked away to continue her conversation with the other employee who was on break.

I ordered a soda with my meal and walked over to the pop machine and wanted ice in my cup, 4 cubes fell out and the machine was empty, I kept pressing the ice bar because it makes a loud click to engage the release for the ice at least a half dozen times while both employees are still talking at the pick up window , which is about 2 feet away. It was obvious that the machine was empty and not once did either employee ask or tell me that they would add more ice to the machine.

So I mentioned to her that the ice machine was empty and she never even looked in my direction. I have a voice that can be heard and for her to ignore me was not going to happen. I then in a louder voice said &#34; the ice machine is empty &#34; and I would like some more ice , she replied OK and continued to talk with her other employee. 3 other customer came in while I was there trying to fill my drink. they never added ice , she never mentioned it to anyone else there to fill it so I had my soda with 4 ice cubes and I guess that all you can have there.

I waited another 8 minutes for my food which was quick and she was talking the whole time I sat there and never filled or made an attempt to fill the ice .

it was 1:20 in the afternoon and  I understand the lunch rush but once I asked if I could have more ice I would have thought they would have filled the machine.
 
sorry but this is not a &#34; respect the customer &#34; type of place I guess. if I wanted rude, and dismissive I would have went to Ed Debevics and would have expected it."

Everything I get here is great, dogs, gyros, burgers, you name it. The best thing about them, however, has to be their fries. Hand cut, Crispy, and Flavorful.

Since it first opened many things have been added and improved.  I&#39;ve tried different things on their menu, from Sandwiches, burgers, all the chicken plates, soups, pasta Wed and salads.  Salads have massively improved, I might have to get one next time I&#39;m in. All their food is seasoned and cooked well. I pay to eat here because the food is fresh. Such as their hot dogs FRESH, not store bought processed in some plant! 

I&#39;d rather pay a little more and know it&#39;s fresh than pay for something cheaper and not know when it expired. The quality of good is good. I always get a lot of food for my money, so I always have leftovers.  I&#39;m happy!

The customer service is always spot on! To address the pricing again, you can always get things from the combo list.  Make smarter choices when buying.  I can get many dishes and be right at $7.00. Much healthier meal than going down the street to McDonalds and paying $5-$9 for a value meal loaded with crap. Just sayin!

They&#39;re all menu items at Fatt Mustard Cafe which is a  burger joint with your not so typical menu.

Imagine an army of french cut french fries (skin on) diving into a bath of boiling peanut oil.  Anybody that knows their fries knows when it&#39;s peanut oil.  Pair these fries with their special house sauce or the hanky panky sauce which tasted of a creamy mustard with a hint of curry.

They take burgers and dogs and give them an upgrade such as the The Big &#34;Opah&#34; Burger which is what happens when a gyro and a burger has a baby.  This was the first thing I tried here and it works

I was also able to bear witness my coworker finishing what they call the &#34;King Kong Challenge&#34; which is the mother of all hot dogs.  I can&#39;t even begin to start describing this monstrosity of a heart attack.

Fun and quick, I think of Fatt Mustard as a guilty pleasure.  The fries are a dark pile of greasy goodness.  The sandwiches are big and juicy.  Look around the dining room and you&#39;ll see old LP album covers from the 1970s and 80s up there.  And a lot of old posters that put you in the mood to relax and have a fun bite to eat before returning to the workday."

They have kooky gourmet designer hot dogs that are named after famous people as well as the more typical staples such as Chicago style, chili dog, etc.  I haven&#39;t tried the gourmet hotdogs, the staples have been good.  With the special, you get two Chicago style hot dogs, really tasty fries and a drink.  The dining area is packed but large.  During noon ~ 1pm, you may not find a table, depending on what time you show up.  The staff is really friendly, and I like the décor of the place as well.  The food is spot on authentic.  The hot dogs taste like Chicago style hot dogs, and fries are out standing.  I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re cut fresh in the kitchen or what, but something about these fries are magical.  I don&#39;t know how late they&#39;re open, but if you&#39;re craving some hot dogs, I suggest you try this place.  As good as Portillo&#39;s hot dogs, if not better.  Try the fries."

I love their chorizo skillet or Spartan (spinach, mushrooms, feta cheese) omelette; the hash browns that accompany them are fresh and yummy.  You get either a side of pancakes or toast; the pancakes are just ok, get the toast instead because it comes with their homemade jelly and it is so good!

The fresh squeezed OJ is awesome and reasonably priced. Eggs &amp; bacon are good. Hash browns are freshly made and perfectly cooked. Service is generally good sometimes a bit slow but all the servers are friendly. The bus boys are super efficient. 

After church on Sunday mornings it gets super busy and pretty loud. There are few a things that  I don&#39;t really like here, the side of pancakes are nothing special and very dry plus the syrup seems extra sweet. Also, they don&#39;t have your standard jelly packets on the table. They serve &#34;their&#34; jam/jelly on the side in a little cup and it has a very strange consistency and flavor so I stay away those items. 
Overall a decent breakfast place."

Nothing fancy, but it&#39;s a solid pancake/eggs/skillets kind of place. They double the eggs which I always forget. I order two and they give four. Personally I don&#39;t need to eat four eggs and I always end up tossing two. That&#39;s a little annoying.

We had told the server when we ordered we were going to need a togo order as well before we left. She came back to our table less than 5 minutes after we received our food to take the next order, but didn&#39;t  bring the menu back.  We were still eating when the togo order was ready.

We were never asked if anything else was wanted  and she moved so quickly when she dropped off the check we didn&#39;t get a chance to ask for drink refills-we had to flag her down.  Note none had been offerred/given during the 30 to 40 minutes we had been there. Then the weirdest thing-while I&#39;m drinking the coffee refill  she comes back to our table and asks if she can have the dish with the sugar in it.  I must have given her a confused look because then she asked, &#39;or are you still using it?&#39;  I gave her the dish, she disappears and we comment how odd this seems.

My plan includes increasing my review from four to five stars after a few visits if the fifth star is warranted. I&#39;ll keep you posted. :-)

I didn&#39;t visit the previous restaurant that was housed in this building very often. It was drab and dingy. The food was meh. The service was fine, but never overly friendly, so it fell from the rotation pretty quickly. So when I saw that a new pancake house was coming soon, I was pretty excited. I work about two minutes away and will never turn down a reasonable lunch spot to work into the plan. Actually, I was in the Lincoln Park area on the weekend after I saw Elly&#39;s coming soon sign and recognized the logo while driving by an Elly&#39;s in that neighborhood. The reviews were good, so I was hopeful for this location. It turns out that they are related which can only mean good things. 

I wandered in on a Friday afternoon right around 1pm. I was a little short on time, so I decided to carryout. The manager was super nice and patiently waited for my decision.  I went with a build your own burger with caramelized onions, bacon and BBQ on the side. It came with cole slaw, seasoned fries and a cup of soup. For less than $9, I was going to walk out with a very full meal. She suggested that the wait would be 15-20 minutes. It ended up being every bit of 20 minutes, so I learned that I definitely need to call ahead to order or eat in when I have a full hour. I waited at a nearby table which was nice because standing in the entrance for 20 minutes would have been strange. I noticed another woman did the same thing nearby. 

The restaurant is open, bright and cheery. The staff was friendly and helpful. I know it&#39;s newly opened, but it felt clean and fresh. I wish I would have had more time because I just would have stayed there to eat. When my order was ready, the manager brought it over and quickly recapped everything that was in the bag.

I ordered my burger on a pretzel roll. Oh boy!  This was really good. It&#39;s quickly become my favorite burger holder. ;-) The bacon was crispy and not burnt. Perfect!  The burger was handpacked and seasoned nicely.  No frozen patties here.  The fries were probably a frozen variety, but the seasoned kind and I really enjoyed them. I skipped the cole slaw. But the chicken shell soup was nice. Giant chunks of chicken breast made this a real treat!  I wish it had been seasoned a bit better as it was a little bland, but hey, everything can&#39;t be perfect. 

I&#39;m going back. Probably sooner than I should.  It was great and I expect to see a lot of happy customers walking out soon."

If you were a regular of Sunny Side Up, the first thing you&#39;ll notice is that the interior is a much happier place. The walls are nice, light and bright, and the light fixtures help open the interior, as opposed to the life-sucking dark wood and carpet of the previous establishment.

Some of the servers are holdouts from Sunny Side, so you&#39;ll get the same good service that you got previously; it just so happens that the food is better. The maple syrup, so far as I could tell, is real. The pancakes had an excellent buttermilk tang.

I picked an odd choice for breakfast; the lox and onion omelette. I got the omelette I expected this time; tall, fluffy, perfectly cooked salmon and onions, and not dried out. The hash browns aren&#39;t as crunchy as they used to be, but they did come out hot and moist.

And of course, the coffee is just right.

Elly&#39;s is a significant step up from Sunny Side Up, and I&#39;d be happy to return here for more!"

The first word that comes to mind when I think of this place is cute. And clean! They have plenty of seating, but it does get a little crowded in the walk ways when they are busy.

Their menu is pretty impressive - there is plenty of variety! Everything from Greek influences to Mexican. They serve both breakfast and lunch - I went with breakfast. They have plenty of healthier options as well. I feel like everything was very fairly priced, and that the service was friendly and attentive as well, especially for being busy.

They did take off two bucks for our trouble

Start to finish a huge fail and $50 for a shitty experience with mediocre food and a rude waitress.. I&#39;ll never be back."

On service alone, this place will not disappoint. The food is also good. Both add up to a nice breakfast experience.

As I do at all breakfast joints I visit, I ordered a skillet, which to me is the perfect breakfast meal. I ordered the mushroom and steak skillet, which did not disappoint. The hash browns could have been crispier, and the skillet is not as flavorful as the skillets from Wildberry, but Elly&#39;s does not skimp on the meat and mushrooms, and a nice layer of cheese tops off this tasty dish. The skillet comes with pancakes, which were pleasantly fluffy. 

I was really impressed with the service at Elly&#39;s. My buddies and I lingered for a bit since we had not met up for a while, and the server was very accommodating. She was neither absent nor overbearing -- the mark of an excellent server -- and best of all, she kept that coffee coming!

Elly&#39;s redecorated after taking over the space from Sunny Side Up, and it&#39;s certainly more inviting and modern. If that memory of the old Sunny Side Up interior has stuck with you, don&#39;t let it stop you from stopping by Elly&#39;s. You won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re walking back into the 80&#39;s. 

All in all, Elly&#39;s is a nice neighborhood establishment with some tasty food. Bring some friends and stay a while!"

Our experience could be described as barely average food with below average service. 

The menu offers a couple items that shows they&#39;re trying to be creative, but the execution is really lacking. On paper, a slice of ham between two pancakes topped with eggs looks original, but the eggs were cold and the ham was the driest piece of meat I&#39;ve had for breakfast...thank goodness for syrup. 

I couldn&#39;t tell if our waitress was just rude or overwhelmed, maybe both. When she would come by, she would ask if we needed something or ask how our food was, but then quickly walk off before we had a chance to respond. Trying to get the check and waiting to get it back from her was no easy task either."

Just returned from Ellys. Now i understand this place might be an improvement from what was here, but that doesn&#39;t excuse from what happened today. And i fully expect this place to look like what a pancake house should look like so i don&#39;t see the big hoopla of new decor. I was seated right away with my wife and two year old. We ordered for our two year old immediately as she was hungry. I ordered a steak skillet and my wife ordered a special. My meal was decent with the exception that I found a foreign object in my meal. It appeared to be a stem of sorts. I would have brought it to someone&#39;s attention had someone asked me how my meal was, never happened. My wife&#39;s eggs terrible runny, no substance.  We were both hungry so we ate and finished the majority of our meals. Here is my biggest gripe:  we sat there for a good hour. I had one water and my wife ordered coffee. Not once were they refilled. I don&#39;t like paying three dollars for a 12 oz coffee cup unless its from Starbucks who knows how to make a three dollar coffee. The entire time I sat there, was with an empty water glass and my wife with her empty cup.  Will I be coming back here? No, unfortunately I will not."

I&#39;ve dined in here many years ago when it was open under a different name but haven&#39;t tried it yet under the Elly&#39;s name. I called in my order and was able to pick it up a few minutes later. 

I ordered the Cajun Chicken Salad mainly because the menu stated it came with red peppers and cucumber. Seems odd to order solely based on those 2 veggies but I was craving them so it was an easy choice. However, the cucumbers didn&#39;t make an appearance on my salad at all. Neither did the red peppers. I think there were maybe 2 tiny pieces of red pepper. The cucumbers were substituted for egg. I don&#39;t like egg on my salad. Had the menu stated that egg was on this salad, I might have made another choice. With all the food allergies going on, you think this would have been noted. Perhaps I was looking at an outdated menu (via their website)?

The salad portion was fairly large and also came with a roll. It was just under $10 which seems a bit pricey but there was chicken so that could have attributed to the high cost.

I may order something else in the future, but will definitely verify that they are going to make the item as the menu suggests."

It was more of a spicy chicken soup with small strips of lettuce. They were too small for me to use as wraps. The soup lacked in chicken but had a good flavor. I only managed to eat about half. The ribs are really good but they are tiny so only get them if you just want something small.

I discovered Cajun food several years ago when some friends took me to Heaven on Seven, and the gumbo was awesome! I haven&#39;t been to too many Cajun places since, but for me, that&#39;s the place to beat. I randomly had a flashback of Heaven on Seven, so sitting in the office, working late, as usual, my coworker and I decided to search Yelp for Cajun, and we found one single place near us. And here we are.

This is the Embassy Suite&#39;s in house restaurant. According to their website, their menu was developed by John Folse, CURRENT president of the American Culinary Institute. Nope! Check for yourself. Ok, I&#39;ve already spent way too much time on this review, because this place just feels like a scam. It plain sucks. The website spouts off this crap and...forget it, I&#39;ll just review the food and get outta here.

CREOLE CRAB CAKE
We got the Bayou sampler, and it came with the wings, ribs, and crab cake. The crab cake was halfway decent. I&#39;ve had Baltimore crab cakes, and I&#39;ve had microwave crab cakes. This is close to the microwave one, but that&#39;s not all that bad! Just because you make it in a microwave doesn&#39;t mean it sucks. And that&#39;s about as much good as I can say about this. Though it was one of the only halfway decent things we tried, it&#39;s not worth $9.95 to get it by itself.

RIBS
These are supposedly covered in a Cajun BBQ sauce, and really, I don&#39;t think it quite worked. It tasted like Sweet Baby Rays with a sprinkle of...something unnatural. Something in this concoction actually, very subtly, tasted gamy! The texture was actually pretty good. Tender, and fell off the bone. At first, it doesn&#39;t taste bad, but once I recognized that mild gamy flavor, it&#39;s all I could taste.

BUFFALO WINGS
These are supposed to be tossed in a &#34;Cajun spicy sweet sauce,&#34; but there was nothing authentic, exotic, or mindblowing about this. These....are....BUFFALO WINGS! And not great ones either! So, that ends our Bayou Sampler. Very mediocre, but probably the best thing here.

GUMBO
When it came out, it looked very...pale. As I drowned the white rice, I noticed the gumbo was a lot more watery than I remember. It&#39;s not quite Chicken Noodle Soup, but it&#39;s not Tomato Soup either. It&#39;s almost like...Minestrone. Surprisingly, it had an acceptable amount of flavor and seasoning. Here&#39;s how I explain this. If I could go to the grocery store, and buy Campbell&#39;s Chunky Gumbo, and this is what came out, I&#39;d be stoked! If I went to a restaurant and paid $4 for this, I am not entertained.

HOUSE SALAD
Who the hell takes time to review a side salad? Well, this was such a spectacular fail, I had to mention it! This was the most horrifying house salad I&#39;ve ever seen! I mean, I&#39;m talking about Denny&#39;s and Baker&#39;s Square being gourmet compared to this! It couldn&#39;t even get 1 star out of 10! First, it was dehydrated! If they splashed it with water, it may have earned 1 star! Second, about 50-75% of the lettuce leaves were browning! YUCK! The tomatoes tasted like fail. Oh and lastly, I asked if I could have a Caesar Salad, and they said &#34;Sure!&#34; But I got a house salad with Caesar dressing. I know, I know, First World Problems, but whatever.

BAYOU COUNTRY CREOLE
Ok! Finally we get to our main course. It&#39;s a hot plate, with 3 lines drawn on it. Creole, white rice, and steamed veggies. My first bite contained a tomato, which was probably the other half of my salad tomato. The whole thing just tasted kinda funny. It took several bites for me to really try to figure out what the familiar taste was, and I got it. Tomato Soup! I took several bites that were completely devoid of tomatoes, and all it really tasted like was tomato soup with peppers and shrimp. Honestly, there was no &#34;Cajun&#34; spice or anything to be found here. It was like straight up tomato paste and veggies. The shrimp were jumbo, but overcooked, so they were a bit tough and chewy. Tomatoes, onions, celery, bell peppers, and garlic, and all I could taste was the tomatoes. 

ONE STAR?!
Yes! My coworker got the Etouffee, and he said it was disgusting too. I actually debated on whether or not to give it 1 or 2, but the fact that we split the bill and each paid $34 for this meal (when we could&#39;ve gone to Morton&#39;s for Restaurant Week and paid $33) made it a no brainer. I don&#39;t give many 1&#39;s. In fact, I give more 5&#39;s than 1&#39;s, and I consider myself a pretty stingy reviewer. So I guess, in that case...Congratulations Lafitte&#39;s, you are among the company of a few! 

Oh, side note. If John Folse developing the menu had anything to do with him typing the menu, he needs to be smacked. Interchangeably uses &#34;bbq&#34; and then &#34;BBQ&#34;. What is &#34;ADozen large chicken..&#34;? You ever been to &#34;Mardi Gra?&#34; Bad tense: &#34;tossed and garnish with...&#34; and so on!"

Our entree&#39;s were too disgusting to eat more than one bite of. They were bland and tasted like chlorine! We sent them back, paid the bill, and bailed. This place needs a complete overhaul. So gross!

Really...you are much better off financially if you buy some shrimp at the grocery store and cook it in dirty pool water; it&#39;ll taste the same as anything you could purchase at Lafitte&#39;s."

I was working late one night and my co-worker and I were tired and hungry and looking for a good place to get something to eat. So where did we go...Yelp. We decided we were in the mood for Cajun and started reading some reviews and came across Laffite&#39;s.  After discussing we decided that we would try it out, after all how off can the previous reviews be...not far.

Here&#39;s what I had to eat.
-the sampler 
  - Creole Crab Cakes (4/10)
  - C&#39;est bon Ribs (4/10)
  - Buffalo wings (3/10)

- Vieux Carre Chicken and Sausage Gumbo (2/10)

- house salad (-1/10)

- Crawfish etouffee (-1/10)


The crab cakes weren&#39;t the worst I&#39;ve had, but weren&#39;t anywhere near the best. they tasted a lot like something I could buy at the local grocery store and heat up in the oven. 

The Ribs had a bit of gamey taste to them.  The meat did fall off of the bone which I love, but other than that not worth it. I was expecting more sauce on them and was disappointed.

The buffalo wings were dry. Nuff said

The Gumbo...yuck. I could have gone to the store and bough a better Gumbo in a can. It was watery and had an appearance of something only creatures from the dark abyss would enjoy. 

The house salad...yup that&#39;s right i am reviewing the house salad. Needless to say didn&#39;t eat more than a couple small bites.  How can a restaurant feel comfortable bringing out brown lettuce. Everything about this salad said fail.

The etouffee...I love etouffee. It is by far my favorite cajun dish. I fell in love with this dish in travels to the South for a couple years, and then traveling there for work.  Not having been back to the South for a few years now i was really craving it. This was just plain bad. It lacked any desirable flavor. It tasted like something they cooked in my gym shoes. Nothing about this tasted fresh as the menu had led me to believe. I think the worst part about this dish was that the crawdads tasted rotten. Having learned my lesson from down South of eating fresh crawdads that tasted rotten and getting food poisoning, I stopped eating. I was very disappointed in this dish...ok I lied, the whole experience.

Will I ever go back to La&#39;feets...nope, I&#39;ll let my feet take me elsewhere."

The word here is bland. In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure if you look up the word &#34;bland&#34; in the dictionary, it would say, &#34;any supposedly authentic dish served by Lafitte&#39;s&#34;. What&#39;s really tragic is how much they pump themselves up on their website, bragging about things like &#34;flawless recipes and presentation&#34; and that &#34;many of the guests comment that they know real Louisiana food, and they concur that Lafitte&#39;s is indeed the real thing.&#34; 

Yeah, okay. (eyeroll)

My crawfish etouffe came served with a whole crawfish in the center of it. His beady little eyes implored me to not eat the etouffe. I wish I had listened. I&#39;ve made etouffe from scratch. I can tell you that this roux sucked. Without an excellent roux, etouffe is doomed. 

The best part of the meal was getting to terrorize my companion with the crawfish. The busser got quite the chuckle out of that.

Note to Lafitte&#39;s - it&#39;s called ICED tea for a reason. It&#39;s not called lukewarm tea, or room temperature tea, or barely cool tea. Learn it. Live it."

We ordered from here for the first time tonight and are so thrilled with the quality of food and service. I ordered carry out and it was ready in fifteen minutes or less, and was assembled neatly in containers when I arrived for pick up. One of the employees even triple checked everything was in place before I paid. It&#39;s so nice to see that level of customer service happen directly in front of you to remind you it still exists. I was too hungry to take a photo before eating, but it seriously looked picture perfect. 

Both my boyfriend and I ordered chicken burritos and they are SO BIG for so little money. We could both only finish half. The chicken was seasoned well and the ingredients were clearly fresh and crisp. We also ordered the supreme nachos which were, in short, delicious. He chose a steak taco as well and said it was better than the other ones he&#39;s tried in the area. We plan on going back tomorrow, Wednesday, for the $0.99 tacos. 

But back to that salsa: So. Good. I love trying salsa from Mexican restaurants and this is top 3 for sure. It&#39;s refreshing and thin, not chunky, and the flavors work so well together. Order it and make your day."

I stopped here midday on a Tuesday and the place was filled with Mexicans for lunch; always a good sign when you see people of the same background in a Mexican/Indian/Greek/etc. restaurants. They offer tacos in both Mexican or American style (different toppings).  I went with the Mexican style.  I had 2 shredded beef &amp; 2 chicken while my girlfriend had 2 pork &amp; 2 beef tongue.  All amazing!  We also had cheezy nachos which were good but pretty standard.  I like that they have an easy to go / pickup area, but, also a nice little dine in area.  We dined in and their free chips and salsa were also delicious!  Salsa seemed home made and very tasty!  I like that they offer a few beer options for dine in as well!

Almost always, I&#39;ve been dissapointed or not very impressed.

I&#39;ve tried this place many times, and every time the food has been delicious! I love their green sauce, not too spicy, but lots of flavor. The red salsa is too spicy for me, but delicious. They are switching their name from &#34;Catering&#34; to &#34;Restaurant &amp; Catering&#34;, and they have a sit down restaurant going on next to their takeout section. The staff mentioned that they will be gearing up to host karaoke, so that should be interesting! Only desire is that they had more of an array of deserts, but they do have Flan and cookies. Haven&#39;t tried these yet though. They do sell beer here and you can place your order in advance for pickup. 

The staff is always very friendly and the food is always brought out fast and hot. The rice and beans are not my absolute favorite, but I think the main entree&#39;s more than make up for this. 

Steak tacos: Plenty of meat, three usually more than fill me up (points for $1 taco day actually having regular size tacos, unlike other some other places)
 
Steak Gorditas: Gorditas are traditionally like thick tortilla flatbreads that are stuffed with meat, cheese, beans and sour cream. The ones served here are not your traditional gorditas, it has a bottom and top piece with the meat and condiments in almost a sandwich form. But it tastes like they make the flatbread tortillas in-house, huge plus for me, they are soo delicious!

Enchiladas (green) with Chicken and cheese: These are not on the menu, but one day I asked for them and they made them. Tortillas were a bit soggy, but overall delicious cheese and delicious seasoned shredded chicken was used. 

Chilaquiles (green): Delicious, crunchy goodness! Only offered as a breakfast item, I usually get these with chicken, beans and rice and an egg over easy. My favorite thing on the menu. 

Horchata: 7/10. It&#39;s delicious, not too sweet, not too bland. Wish it was a bit thicker, but quenches my horchata craving. 


It is in the same lot as the Village Tavern, next to the 7/11. They also just extended their hours, which is great for me! 9:00 am - 10:00 pm.

It had to be one of the best I&#39;ve ever had, from the meat to the fresh ingredients to that toasted crunch on the bread. Just delicious!

While they&#39;re good, they&#39;re far from authentic in the same way P.F. Chang&#39;s is anywhere close to genuine Asian food. So, setting off to discover something remotely close to the Real McCoy of Mexican food, my wife and I happened to stumble on Pancho&#39;s in a hapless sort of way. I expected it to be okay and was thrilled to discover it was so much better.

Despite being nestled in a small strip mall, so unassuming that if you weren&#39;t looking for Pancho&#39;s you might very well miss it, the place is nothing less than a hidden gem at the very least. Walking in, the place is simple and unassuming, but conveys a homely feeling of a neighborhood taqueria with an alluring smell to match. The couple behind the counter are all too happy to take an order or toss out a recommendation.

Opting to try the pork burrito, I was curiously enthralled to see how it matched to Chipotle given that&#39;d been my usual meal of choice when visiting there. My wife ordered a foursome of steak tacos. We also opted to split some nachos and queso. Forgoing fountain drinks, which aren&#39;t offered, my wife nabbed a can of Pepsi and I a bottle of orange Fanta. Altogether, we spent roughly $20.

Directed to take a seat in the dining area, the gentleman behind the counter brought out our drinks and a set of chips with salsa. While I found the salsa to have a slight kick, my wife -- ever more sensitive to spicy food -- found it unbearably hot. Wimp. She nearly downed her entire can of soda trying to alleviate the heat and was all too happy when the nachos arrived.

Though a bit sad and slightly better than what one would expect at a movie theater or ballgame, I couldn&#39;t be too upset with the appetizer. Taken at face value, it made me wistful about waiting for my food to get there, filling me with anticipation and did it well. While it wasn&#39;t necessarily anything that could be considered to rewrite the playbook on nachos, it was perfect in that it left the bar at a place for our meal to surpass it. 

When my wife&#39;s tacos finally showed up accompanied by my burrito, we couldn&#39;t have been more excited. The smell was just about enough to trigger a Pavlovian response. Hungrily, I sampled the first big bite and slowly savored it, dragging the moment out. It was great. Down right fantastic and some of the finest Mexican food I had ever had the joy of tasting in the Chicago burbs.

Sampling one of the tacos off my wife&#39;s plate, it turned into me eating an entire one, complemented with a slight amount of green salsa to give it a bit of limey flavor. Equally good, I felt like the normal sweetness of the tacos and burritos outer wrap was dispensed, giving the food contained therein each its own moment to be savored. My wife said it best when she exclaimed that she hadn&#39;t had Mexican this good since she lived on the South Side and I was inclined to agree. Pancho&#39;s offered the delectable flavor of the city to us deprived folks of the suburbs and delivered it exceptionally well.

We quietly ate as much as we could before we were both too full for another bite. Taking home half of my burrito and my wife bringing a solitary taco, we saw our way out. It wasn&#39;t long before the leftovers were gone -- in fact, they didn&#39;t even last through the evening.

The service was exceptional, the prices right and atmosphere vastly welcoming -- it was purely icing on the cake that, for the most part, the food was positively delightful. If you&#39;re ever in the area, it&#39;s well worth stopping in, if for no other reason than the place is leagues beyond the next best thing suburbanites have access to: Chipotle."

The food is ready super fast too, and who doesn&#39;t love that?

They are currently working on building a dining room, so I have a feeling we will be adding this to our little circle of Mexican spots to eat very soon.  I am excited to see how their menu grows and improves.

Seeing the &#34;catering&#34; planted all over the windows actually made me reluctant to go in. It also may throw expectations to be low. Boy, was I surprised. 

I love a good taco. The ones that are made right with the cilantro and onions. I&#39;ve been to many establishments boasting &#34;the best taco&#34; but have been mildly disappointed. Panchos has fantastic tacos. My recommendations would be to try the pastor (pork) and the lengua (tongue). Both are fantastic choices of meat along with the warm tortilla, of course. They also have mild and hot sauce available, which I love. I down my tacos down with a bottle of jarritos which is 1.25 per bottle.

Their tacos are awesome. They have .99 cent tacos on Mondays and Wednesday which, unfortunately, I have missed out on. Their burritos, quesadilla, and others are okay. Their prices are very good. Like, cheaper than Chipotle prices. The staff is very nice and friendly, too. 

Overall I love this place and look forward to coming back."

P.S. It is actually on the corner of NW Hwy &amp; Central (don&#39;t trust the map on here)!"

This restaurant is located in MOUNT PROSPECT at the intersection of Central and Northwest Highway. It is not on Milwaukee Avenue in Wheeling. I am trying to contact Yelp to change this. That being said, this is my regular gyro joint. Best gyros around. The chicken gyro is great as well. So are the tacos. They have Mexican Coke in the cooler, and Pepsi products from the fountain. The family that runs this place is wonderful, warm and friendly and providing great service and food. Lots of cops and contractors lunch here. Outdoor seating was recently upgraded to nice picnic tables with umbrellas. The owners are always making improvements, a good sign of pride and prosperity."

I went in last week for a small meal and they had trouble running my Chase card. They had the same trouble with two other customers. All three of us waited and the older lady who was very pleasant must have said &#34;be patient&#34; 20 times to each of us. I didn&#39;t want to eat my food until the bill was settled but she said go ahead. She must have run my card 6-7 times and it finally went through...35 minutes later! I asked if I would be charged more than once and she said &#34;no, of course not.&#34; But sure enough, the next day when I went online and looked at my account the same charge showed up twice on the same day. So I thought no big deal I&#39;ll just stop by the next day and show them a copy of my account and get a credit or refund. A young girl who I showed my account info to said that her mother wasn&#39;t working the night I said she was and I said well I don&#39;t care who was working I&#39;m simply trying to get a refund. She asked me 4-5 questions and I said it didn&#39;t matter that she could see the name of their restaurant on my account twice for the same amount. Please give me a refund. She was so rude I couldn&#39;t believe it. She yelled at me, looked at another customer as though I was doing something wrong...the she started crying while she supposedly gave me a credit with my card. She told me they don&#39;t need people &#34;like me&#34; as customers and to never come back! I couldn&#39;t believe what I was experiencing...it was like being in the twilight zone! I called Chase and told them about my experience and they said there was no credit from Olympus Gyros but they would immediately remove the second charge. This girl should have apologize and given me a credit and I&#39;d still be a customer. They could give me a 12 month gift card and I wouldn&#39;t step in there again. The local health dept. should take a surprise look at the cooking area and bathrooms. I bet you a nickel they don&#39;t have a food sanitation license. Wow! This has to be the worst experience in a so-called restaurant, EVER!"

I pass Olympus Gyros on a pretty regular basis with my buddy so the last time we passed by, we made it a point to stop in the next time.  We walked in &amp; took a look at the extensive menu, the first thing I noticed was that they served Mexican food.  I thought that was a little strange for a Greek place to serve Mexican food in addition to their gyros, hot dogs, burgers &amp; such.  But it didn&#39;t stop there, they also serve breakfast!  I was already impressed &amp; hadn&#39;t even ordered anything yet.  My friend ordered a chicken gyro &amp; I opted to try their cheeseburger, fries &amp; drink combo since that&#39;s what I normally order when trying out a new place.  The nice lady at the counter said she would call us when our food was ready.  Our orders were done pretty quickly &amp; the lady at the counter asked if I needed any ketchup since there was none to be found on the tables or near the napkin station.  She walked around the counter over to the cooler where the bottled drinks are &amp; brought me some ketchup which I easily could&#39;ve gotten myself, but she was very nice about it &amp; went above &amp; beyond when she didn&#39;t have to, that&#39;s service right there.  My cheeseburger &amp; fries were hot, fresh &amp; tasted a lot better than most hot dog/gyro places I&#39;ve patronized.  My buddy said his chicken gyro was one of the best he&#39;s had, so I&#39;ll have to try one on a future visit.  The place had a very warm &amp; homey feel to it, even though this was my first time here, I felt like I had been coming here for years.  The lady behind the counter, who I assume is an owner, was so kind &amp; nice.  A few customers came in, placed their order &amp; started telling her about how one of them recently got engaged, how often do you hear that kind of conversation at a gyro place?  So that, along with their excellent food will definitely bring me back!"

This was a return trip, and Olympus was just as good the second time. The place is a small old ex-dinner type scene but it&#39;s clean.  Friendly service.  The gyros came with a big pile of fresh sliced meat in a REAL pita not a pocket, could barely close it.  They use real tsaziki sauce yogurt cucumber not lame Greek salad dressing. 

The fries are just like the type you get in &#34;Cheese Burger in Paradise&#34; joints you get all over the Mexican coast.  Thin, crispy salty goodness.

Between the 2 of us, we had the GYROS SANDWICH and the CHICKEN PITA SANDWICH, both of which were really tasty. The cucumber sauce at this restaurant was amazing!

We didn&#39;t sample the fries, so I can&#39;t make a review about that.  Also, the difference in cost of a sandwich, and a plate of the same thing, was about +$4.  I guess that accounts for the fries and drink?  I don&#39;t know.  All in all, a good spot for lunch.  I&#39;d be back"

We were not disappointed. I ordered waffle fries, their regular chicken sandwich and a lemonade around 9 am (we were in the area for an appointment). The employee took my order, was courteous in explaining the wait and after paying, filled the drink first while the food was prepared.

The spicy chicken burger is not bad though. Definitely spicier than KFC or Popeyes since McDonald&#39;s doesn&#39;t have spicy McChickens. Their waffle fries are alright. I would still prefer Popeyes curly fries. These fries kind of taste like Wendy fries to me. So if you like their fries you would like these ones. 

I ordered their salad this time and it isn&#39;t bad. The salad was more expensive than the chicken tender meal. Eating healthy is more expensive than grabbing a burger meal. 

The customer service for this fast food place is phenomenal. From right when you walk in, to ordering, to sitting down to leaving, everyone who worked there was super nice. They would come around to ask if we needed water, more sauce, or anything else. I think that is why people come back because I would. It&#39;s such a nice and warm environment to be eating at.

This location is busy. We came here on a weekday at lunch. The drive thru had no less than 10 cars waiting and the inside had a line with almost all the tables at maximum capacity. 

We stood in line, placed our order with a very kind and genuine employee. See my pictures. Her smile was contagious! We were lucky to find a table! They brought our food to the table and the order was perfect. The food was hot and tasty. Two different employees stopped by to check on our meal as well as ask if we wanted our drinks refilled.

The crispy chicken nuggets are my favorite thing to get. The chick-fil-a sauce is worth trying, I think it is pretty good! 

Great quality chicken meat, which given their name you should expect that. This means a lot to me because I am really picky with the meat I eat, and I know that the chicken is of good quality  and doesn&#39;t contain a bunch of fat on it."

My only complaint about this location in particular is the service. I&#39;d like to preface this by saying they are almost always friendly. In the mornings, however, there have been times where I&#39;ve had to wait 5 minutes for a sandwich. The last time this occurred the employees were too busy replacing headset batteries instead of at least telling me that it was going to be a few minutes. I literally felt like I was a burden because I&#39;d come there for breakfast. I was given my bag with no acknowledgement that I had been sitting there for that long staring in the window like a creep, waiting for my food. I was late for work that day - not that that is their fault, but nonetheless it contributed. Another time I slipped and fell in the parking lot on some black ice and informed them of said ice - I left there with a huge catering order and kind of thought that maybe considering my bleeding knee that they would have offered help back to the car. Nope. And other times with catering orders (we order often) same thing - there is just me and a huge amount of stuff to bring to my car and no offer of help. So - yeah, this is kind of a &#34;meh&#34; location for me. I enjoy Chick Fil A because of the food and the quality of the service so hopefully it improves as it ages a little.

It was beyond bad.My boyfriend ordered a chicken club which was equally as tasteless .
I have had better chicken at Wendy&#39;s .Not to mention it cost about $20 for us to eat food worse than they have on McDonald&#39;s $1.00 menu.

The manager or owner of this place (at least that&#39;s who I think he is) was so nice and provided among the best customer service I have ever experienced. He engaged in friendly conversation and when I went up to get napkins he told me to sit down as he got them. He also offered us a refill on our drinks on the way out. I&#39;ve never seen such awesome customer service at a fast food place and I will definitely be coming back not just for the food!!! The girls at the cash register were also really nice.

Their spicy chicken is the best, always nice and crunchy, never greasy, with a very nice kick. Their waffle fries are good, too. I also feel their customer service goes above and beyond, exceptionally courteous and quick to serve. This is true of any of their establishments I&#39;ve been to. The interior is clean and has plenty of tables with window views, which I like. When I get a craving for fast food there is no where else!"

Solid 5 stars! What a great find! So far very consistent...had sandwiches there three times and the chicken breast they use is huge! We couldn&#39;t believe how heavy the box was with my sandwich. Last time we ordered one sandwich and shared and it was plenty for two adults. 

It&#39;s got an inconvenient location and, while I think it&#39;s a great find I&#39;m almost hesitant to share this info because I don&#39;t want it to become overrun! It&#39;s that good!!

YES to the tasty grilled fresh prepared food everybody is raving about. Large Havana is not as spicy as I was led to believe, spicy mustard is not spicy habanero, but good. The texas toast travels really well, and remember this is not the lo-cal plate. OK Fries are fresh cut with skins and refreshingly not a salt bomb, thank you. Next time I&#39;m gonna try the slaw.
The stuffed pepper soup, think Italian Wedding soup, was a salt bomb and on the greasy side but delicious and I wouldn&#39;t change a thing. You might want to omit the optional feta cheese if you are watching salt, but it added a lot. Large 16oz serving for $3. We split a Havana and soup and it was plenty for us, no leftovers except a lot of fries. $15 with tip. Great road food.

Laura was very helpful as we stumbled through their menu the first time. We like Bomba grill and bet their rating goes up, another reason to like Dundee.
Link wasn&#39;t working tonight but here it is off their sign.

Entrance and exit to Bomba can be tricky. I was heading East and made a U-turn to get into Bomba, watch out for people making right on reds there. I had decided to not even try to turn East out of there but it was completely OPEN when we left so we did. Parking lot is small.
Be careful."

I had a 45 minute drive so I was weary of fries making it that distance but I figured I&#39;d try anyway. I ordered 2 Havanna sandwiches, one with fries and pasta salad and one with pasta salad. Even driving 45 minutes did not affect the sandwiches! They were amazing and I can only imagine what a fresh, hot sandwich was like! The flavor is incredible, like a pork and beef explosion. The bread and cheese make the sandwich! The fries were soggy but after driving 45 minutes that was expected. My dogs sat by the table drooling when they smelled the food! I shared some fries with my pups! They approved. The pasta salad was fabulous, Greek style with shaved Parmesan cheese. I will share the menu with co-workers and will eat in to get a more fresh experience. I look forward to trying other menu items!"

It seems this place is becoming a victim of it&#39;s own success.  I had the bacon wrapped hotdog with chili and cheese, both coworkers had the Havana.  Hotdog was good, but average - both said the Havana was good.  The problem was waiting - it took over 30 minutes to get our orders and we had to move outside because it was so smoky (from the grill, not smokers) inside the restaurant.  The lady working the counter apologized and gave us all credits for a future visit, which was nice.

I will be back - I think this place has a lot of potential and they are still working through the kinks of being a new, successful business.  

One more note - parking can be tight and exiting the lot and heading east is a challenge."

Cruising down the bike trail and was craving a hot dog. Yelped this place and it&#39;s so close. Go here for your biking break. Lady waiting on customers was super friendly and the food is so unique. I had the Chicago dog which is unlike any Chicago style dog I&#39;ve ever had. The dog is grilled perfectly and very tasty. The bun is no standard dog bun either. It&#39;s like it&#39;s cut from a squat loaf of bread and sliced to fit the ingredients. It&#39;s grilled on the sides and the presentation is awesome. I asked myself how I was going to be able to eat this thing. Pasta salad was a nice alternative to fries. Place ended up fairly busy and gentleman sitting by me said the burgers and beefs are great too. Can&#39;t wait to come back and try the fries!

My guess it would be BOMBA Grill.  My wife and I split a Havana and a Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  We couldn&#39;t finish either - but not for lack of desire.

Subtlety is not a virtue at BOMBA.  Both sandwiches were huge - and displayed a fusion of flavors and ingredients which were both delicious and daunting.  The Havana deserves the raves it has been receiving - but the Buffalo Chicken might be better.  It&#39;s an over-the-top combination of buffalo chicken, cheese and bacon which could have fed four.  

The pasta salad side was enormous - and delicious.

This is not your ordinary sandwich place.  It&#39;s built for the serious eater who&#39;s looking for creativity and quantity.  The only thing it needs is an easier to access location.  Mr. Otto - can&#39;t you rent them space on River?  Bomba Grill is ready to move up town."

Bomba you have my eye. I will certainly be in again to try that Havana that everyone has been raving over. As well as the mushroom burger and fried pickles. Keep it up  stick around. Great fast food spot yelpers!!! Check them out.   

Update!!!  I went back 8/14/15 I give it another 5 stars!!! This time took the wife , I had the Havana , had to try . other reviews pointed out the sand which so tired it, conclusion !!! This sandwich was fire!!!!! The first four letters of the restaurant say it best bomb!!! Owner / cook didn&#39;t have enough pork came out to as if he could add some other meats to it, but I wanted to try it how it suppose to have been made. Even with from what he said a smaller portion or pork, the sandwich was the shit! I don&#39;t know if I can swear on here but I am cause it&#39;s that damn good, the wife had the Dundee burger, which she loved but didn&#39;t finish.

House salad was fresh and crisp (ranch was pretty good).
The deep dish pizza (pineapple - half sausage/half pepperoni) was OK. Good crust reminiscent of Jake&#39;s.  Sauce was kind of bland.  Lots more pineapple than meat.  Overall an above average pie.  
Beer (Stella from the tap) was good but could have been served colder.
Atmosphere was nice.
Service was a bit slow but friendly."

I had the Cavatinni with Vodka Sauce sause that was devine. The atmosphere was a bit dark and noisey or i would give 5 stars.  Very satisfying dining experience all in all. Highly recommended.

I&#39;ve been to this unassuming pizza place a few times and have been impressed by their thin crust pizza. They seem to use very fresh ingredients and the cheese is not too greasy. The best is when you buy it on one day where all pizzas were 50% off however I don&#39;t know if they are still running this promotion. The largest pizza is enough to feed a lot of people. I have not tried any of their other type of pizzas except for their thin crust.

Pros: Great thin crust pizza not too greasy

Cons: Gets really busy and customer service at the desk is sometimes lacking

Hidden deals:
Monday used to be 50% pizza however you should call to verify that this is still the case"

Décor: The outside is a bit unassuming as it is in a strip mall, but inside they do a solid effort of making it feel as authentic as they can. The party &#34;area&#34; (it was not a separate room) was the perfect size for our gathering and the rest of the place is a decent size too. I was told that they just recently expanded their space so that must have been where we were located.
Bathroom: clean and inviting

Staff: All of the waitresses were johnny-on-the-spot with anything that we needed. Great service!

Food: As you might imagine, we had pizza. There was a salad to accompany it, which was basic and very tasty, and the pizzas had assorted toppings. Everything was very tasty and there was more than enough food to go around. Great taste, flavor, and everything was hot and fresh!

Value: unknown

Pasta Mia is a great little Italian spot at which I would not mind returning for a full on meal."

I should let anyone know that if you&#39;re looking for a quick review, I think the place is good and at a fair price. If you want to hear my detailed review and get down to the specifics, then I suggest to read along.

When you walk in, you will notice immediately how greatly designed the interior is. One side is the dining room, while the other side is the bar. I prefer to be on the bar side, as the dining room side can get noisy and crowded. The bar has many beers on tap (from IPA&#39;s to Lite) and has a wide selection of whiskey and vodka. They have a large selection of martinis, but the one alcohol you should drink is wine, especially at an Italian restaurant. The bar side has high top tables, so bringing your grandmother may not be a good idea (unless you dined in the dining room with low top tables). Even though it isn&#39;t your typical bar, it is still a great place to grab a cocktail and enjoy some appetizers.

The service is, well, hit or miss. I had a few of the waitresses take my order and were slow. They would bring the wrong food out, and even mess up the drink order. On the other hand, I have had a waiter and a waitress give me great service and deliver the food right on time. I guess some of them are great, and others are ok.

The food is good. I&#39;m not going to say great because I have had better dishes, but for what you pay, you get an excellent bargain. I have many favorites, and I am going to label the better dishes and the lesser of them.

Great Dishes You Have To Try:
- Any Special (they&#39;re always great)
- Calamari (try all 3 ways!)
- Grilled Misto
- Eggplant Stacks &amp; Eggplant Rolls
- Wings
- Pasta Fagioli (the only item I get every time I am there)
- Vinnie&#39;s Meatball Salad
- Italian Beef Sandwich
- Shrimp Scampi
- Chicken Marsala
- Chicken Vesuvio
- DA CHEEZY BEEF PIZZA! (THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD TRY!)

The stuffed artichoke and the veal dishes will upset you.

Overall, its a nice, cozy place. Pete is a great guy, and he&#39;s always happy. I hope one day this place takes off and eventually expand. It&#39;s all homemade, and I hope you can experience this for yourself."

I was with a group of 6 friends, myself included, nobody was there and this was around 8ish... I don&#39;t remember the name of our waitress but she had such a terrible attitude and her tip reflected that, sad to say. I get that it is Halloween and if it was a bad day to be at work, that did not need to be shown to me or my friends but it was. We were not offered an appetizer, nor dessert and I would want my staff pushing guests to order more food if it would help business, my opinion. We had extra pizza at the end and we were not offered a to go box to take home our food. We had had enough of our dinner and just wanted to get out. Also we were not refilled with water and went to the car to get water because she seemed too bothered to be asked.

I do recommend this place because in the past I have experienced quality service and the food is good.

Very disappointed yesterday in our service and hope for better the next time."

Have not been there in a long time but from what I remember it was good. Daughter ordered a sandwich and a slice of pizza. I ordered a dinner special. Salad comes out on a small plate with cup of dressing on the plate. Wrong dressing and very small salad. No bread. I ask for some bread. No bread.  Out of bread at 8pm open till ten no bread at 8. Pasta comes out. The smallest amount of pasta I&#39;ve ever seen at a Italian restaurant. My daughter looked at it and said &#34;is that it&#34; and laughed. I ate it and had to order a slice of pizza. Go if your not hungry. Food tasted ok but the portion was as small as I have seen. Daughters sandwich was ok I guess.

I handed the burnt pizza back to the delivery man and asked him to hold on so I could check the new one.  His response was&#34;I don&#39;t have time you are costing me money&#34;.

I just didn&#39;t know what to expect when we came here. We always drove by and figured we&#39;d give it a shot. I honestly feel like I would have been better off flushing my money down the toilet. 

Here&#39;s what we ordered:
Chicken Vesuvius which came with salad:
This was described on the menu as chicken with garlic and a light sauce with potatoes.  When I got it I was a little blown away. The potatoes are actually potato wedges (the kind you deep fry and eat away your sorrows at a cheap bar). There was no color in the dish and whatever the sauce was wasn&#39;t a sauce...it was a oil slick. There was garlic, but it didn&#39;t taste like anything except bland sadness. The chicken itself had obviously been frozen for months. For $15 I could have just driven a few miles and gotten all you can eat sushi instead. The taste was revolting. It was equivalent to what I would give my son as a punishment. There was zero seasoning on this dish. I ate one potato wedge (of the 5 on the plate) and half a chicken breast (of the 3 on the plate) and politely declined when the waitress asked if I wanted the rest wrapped up because I wouldn&#39;t even have the nerve to give this to my dog. The salad was OK...you can&#39;t mess up a salad...but the croutons were burnt.

Chicken Pollo sandwich:
My fiance ordered this and by the look on his face alone I&#39;m gathering that he didn&#39;t enjoy it at all. The bread itself was gluey on the inside and then indestructible on the outside. It looked to be an egg bread (shiny on the outside) but it looked like it had the consistency akin to something like polyester. Hey it flexes, but you can&#39;t rip it apart.  How the inside was raw is beyond me. He got potato salad with it and it completely lacked seasoning. He ended up eating half of the potato salad and only the chicken (which was dry) from the inside of the sandwich.

Chicken tenders and fries:
My son got this (I&#39;m so sorry, Desmond). The chicken fingers were obviously frozen. They looked like Tyson chicken nuggets, just longer. The fries have zero seasoning. They just tasted old to be honest. He didn&#39;t eat much of it thankfully.

At the end of this excursion I spent $36 plus tip. When you stop and think of the things you could have gotten for $36+ instead of dropping it on food you only ate 1/4 of it gets really depressing. $36 gets you a lot of decent sushi up the street. $36 pays for a month of internet. $36 gives you a good amount of groceries. $36 pays for two and a half months of world of warcraft. $36 will make a homeless person&#39;s day. If I wanted a ton of frozen food served to me, I would have gone and bought $36 of frozen food from Jewel because at least then I&#39;d throw salt on it before serving it.

This was by far the worst food I ever put in my mouth and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I got sick off the 5 bites I did dare to take of this food. All that went through my head was how this place is worse than some places you see on restaurant impossible."

The food has been going downhill for the past few years. The past 4 times I&#39;ve ordered the chicken Parmigiana it has been dry to where I have to add my own sauce or throw it out. This past week we ordered pizza for delivery and again need to add extra sauce because it seems they cut back on it. Well the pizza was delivered and it looks like the driver tipped it and all the topping slid off the pizza all to one side. I called and the mgr said it&#39;s because we ordered extra sauce!! He me me feel like it was my own fault. We always order extra sauce never had trouble. He told me he would remake a new pizza and my husband had to go get it!! They didn&#39;t offer to refund the pizza price or the delivery charge we paid earlier! By the way with extra sauce my husband got it home in one piece!!!

It&#39;s nice to be able to go and get delicious pizza by the slice. And really tasty pizza. If you come at night and it isn&#39;t super busy, you&#39;ll have all the bartender&#39;s attention - and this place has some pretty good cocktails. They had a frozen lemon vodka drink this summer that was excellent. 

The food is really good, but I don&#39;t recommend planning a party here - it seems like their party planning is very disorganized and it&#39;s difficult to get hold of Pete. The staff is helpful though and accomodating to requests. We had a party here, and they didn&#39;t provide enough food for the size of our party, the bakery they mandate that you use didn&#39;t do what we asked, and once we were seated the wait staff basically forgot about us and never served us drinks or anything.

Anyway, like I said, I have to go back once a year or so to be reminded this place is no good, which I did about two weeks ago.  Still the same old tough chicken marsala with plain pasta slapped on the dish for some unknown reason, and still the same cardboard pizza with pizza sauce that has no seasoning and tastes like tomato sauce.
I will say though I&#39;ve never had problems with servers, wait times, or out of stock food."

The dining room suggests this place to be a fine dining establishment, but the clientele occupying the dining room suggested otherwise. Very casual

Started off with the appetizer platter, which consisted mozzarella stick, wings, jalapeno poppers and ravioli, which was decent, but nothing special.

We then ordered &#34;Da Cheezy Beef&#34;, which is pretty much a NY Style stuffed pizza, meaning no sauce on the top. Again, it was good, but like the appetizers nothing special.

Our server was very attentive and accommodating and made frequent checks on our table. 

I may come back to try an entrée or a thin crust pizza if I am in the area."

The place is very close to home and when we got there at like 6:45 dining room was empty, but the bar had people. Our waitress was very friendly she told us that Monday was half price pizza. We ordered a cheese and sausage pan pizza, a pasta entrée, arrancini, and chicken wing appetizer. My son loved the teriyaki wings, the arrancini was just so-so, the pasta had artichoke and tomato-pretty good, but the pizza was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!  We LOVED it. I have no idea why some of the other reviews were not so good. Perfect crust, just the right amount of sauce and tons of cheese. This was only $9.97, once the half off was taken.

As I&#39;m walking to the front door I see a really nice Mercedes backed up to the sidewalk. I hate to say it but I figure if people with money like it, it must be good. Then upon entering the front door the restaurant looks clean and the decor is very much what I like to see from a quality Italian restaurant. Nice bar smelled good.....then it went down hill.

Service was pretty weak all around. Our waitress kept hanging out with her friends up and the nice bar and my wine glass found itself to be more empty than full most of the night. Food was simply average..one of those non memorable meals that you wondered what you paid for when you left. Found out from the table next to us that the nice car parked in front of the door was the owner. Guess hes not a big fan of walking  very far..why would you when you can just have your customer hike a few extra steps.

The pizza sauce you can for sure taste the garlic. We went on a Monday and it was half priced pizza. I also had the vesuvio soup that was great and the bread that came with was very fresh and tasty. I also had the stuffed artichoke it was quite different from other places I&#39;ve had this similar dish. It tastes more like stuffing at Thanksgiving then in Italian stuffing with cheese. The bartender was our server and she was great I think if we go back we would definitely get a pasta dish not quite the best pizza in town if you know what I mean.

This is the first time I&#39;ve ever eaten at any Pasta Mia -- We went as a family - 8 of us.  Was this the waiter&#39;s first job??  We were seated at a long table around the corner in the restaurant with practically no light at all.  Waiter comes with plates/silverware/oil.  We waited FOREVER for bread.. One basket for 8 people?  And he brings drinks.. eventually.  No sweetener.  We pass our own plates/silverware around as he clearly can&#39;t be bothered.   

Waiter could  not get the drink orders straight..  WHO had lemon?? Who had wine? Who had this?  

When the &#34;entrees&#34; came out.. the waiter brought 3..  The rest of us had to wait and wait and wait and wait.  I got my salad when another person got their hamburger..  ??  

One person ordered a slice of pizza that included broccoli..  We&#39;re told they ran out. Sorry.  I ordered linguini in white clam sauce.  15 min later I&#39;m told they gave my food away and they just ran out of clams.  Did I want the shrimp scampi pasta??  Horrific choice.  Dry and no garlic butter to be found anywhere in that bowl.  By this time, we are out of bread.. again.  We had to ask, repeatedly, for more bread. ONE loaf of 6 pieces is not enough for 8 hungry people.  

The pizza crust tasted like cardboard ( margherita) and I can safely tell everyone we will NEVER come back to this place, again.  The waiter was more worried about a table of 3 young girls than serving us.  His excuse for running out of food was due to the holiday weekend and that they put their orders in on Tuesday. My daughter works in food service. That was a bunch of bunk. They need to hire somebody who KNOWS how to order.. and a waiter who KNOWS how to wait.. and a COOK who knows what he&#39;s doing.  UGH..  If I could give it -l0 stars I would..  NO THANKS."

It&#39;s a little tucked away but still close enough to the downtown area. The strip mall it&#39;s located in is behind a Walgreens and by the Post Office, in case you were curious. 
It&#39;s not a huge fancy establishment, it&#39;s kind of like half a bar and half a sit and eat but don&#39;t stick around there&#39;s only a handful of tables kind of place. I would call it a family restaurant though even though there is a bar vibe. A lot of kids and families are there when we drop by, so its all good! 

The first time around we were not impressed at all by the food. We got some kind of pasta dish, I think I got the chicken marsala which was obviously not too memorable. I mean pasta IS in the name? It tasted very oily, bland and something that I could easily whip up...which trust me folks is not a compliment! We left full but not that impressed.

I don&#39;t know what it was, maybe laziness and not wanting to venture out too far, and we were starving...but we decided to try Pasta Mia again, this time we ordered a pizza. Because At least half of the patrons in the place always had a pizza, so we followed their lead! I&#39;m so glad we did too because it was a-freaking-mazing! Really, this is now one of my favorite places to go for Pizza, that isn&#39;t ridiculously expensive for a bland pie.  The crust is thin, but not paper thin, and the ingredients fresh. What else do you want? Well for me, not a whole lot! 

Bonus there are sometimes coupons floating around through the mail, so if you&#39;re in the area keep your eye out. But there hasn&#39;t been one recently *ahem* Did you hear that Pasta Mia? 

So oddly enough I would skip the pasta at Pasta Mia or try at your own risk. But I would definitely order up a pizza, it&#39;s fantastic!"

My friend grew up in Bartlett, and Pasta Mia was a staple in their house.  When she recommended it when on her way to my house, I was game :)

We ordered:
Cavatelli w/ vodka sauce (it comes w/ soup, and we ordered the chicken vegetable)
Minestrone Soup
Medium Cheese-Well done
Medium Mia Supreme-Well done
Fried Dough

The thing that fell short was the Fried Dough--we barely ate any of it.  Maybe it would be better if it was fresh and not take-out, but I don&#39;t think I would order it again.

The pasta was really good, the soups were ok (I would try again) but I really, really enjoyed the pizzas.  They were flavorful and the ingredients were really fresh.  The kids downed the cheese pizza, so I know that was a hit!

The price wasn&#39;t bad--all of the above food was for $46.  Not &#34;cheap&#34;, but then again, it doesn&#39;t taste cheap, either.  I appreciate that!

But sometimes you&#39;ve just got to dine in for pizza. So before my kids&#39; class we decided to stop in -- thinking I had an hour so it should be fine. Especially since we were the only people in there. 

I informed the guy that sat us -- well scratch that, we sat ourselves. The server came out about 5 minutes later. We ordered. I let him know that we had to be out in at least 40 minutes and he said no problem -- that the pizza would be ready in 10 minutes. 

Well about 20 minutes later the server noticed we were still sitting there. I asked him if I could pay at that time, and also have the pizza put in a box since I knew getting that done close to the time we had to leave would probably stress me out. 

Finally we got the pizza. Something is different in the sauce from what it used to be. I think it&#39;s that there is not as much garlic. But here is what I will say, THE CRUST WAS AWESOME. Again, THE CRUST ON THE WELL DONE PIZZA WAS AWESOME.

We walked in with about 10 other people and we waited to be seated, as other grabbed menus and took seats, we finally determined that was normal.  Grabbing 5 menus we took a round table.  Later we watched as other were seated so...that was a bit confusing.

Lighting...let&#39;s say it was intimate dark...hard to read the photocopied menus, luckily we have flashlight apps on the phones!  

I asked about specials for the night, our server explained that they were on the back, ok...he walked away and when he came back I asked if there were any other specials he said...&#34;No.&#34;  I then asked about half price pizza&#39;s...oh &#34;Yes, that is a special tonight.&#34;

There were five of us and we ordered two pizzas a plate of chicken fingers, a stuffed artichoke and a cup of soup.  After about 20 minutes we got our water and I noticed that another table had gotten bread, I asked about that and was told it would be right out...that went ok.  At that time the soup and salad arrived, the salad was not drained and full of water the soup was ok.  

While waiting we could hear someone, yelling at the staff in back from the front of the house...that was interesting.  No cursing so no Ramsay effect but it still seemed a bit unprofessional.  I know it happens but I have only heard it in the house a few times.

The pizzas came out at the 35 minute mark, they were warm and they were prepared correctly...but there was nothing special about them.   We had ordered the Hawaiian and the Cheezy Beef...eh, they were ok.  The Cheezy was full of a lot of giardiniera and a little beef.  The beef was not tasty at all.  The Hawaiian was not bad, a little salty but we have had worse.

We had to ask after 10 more minutes about our chicken fingers and our stuffed artichoke.  They arrived, the chicken fingers did not excite the diner and the artichoke was more artichoke flavored bread.

The bill came and there were a few errors, the pizzas were not half off, I had to get that corrected and the price we were billed was different from the menu we had been given, off by a dollar...we let them keep that one.

Will NOT be returning."

I&#39;ve been dining at Pasta Mia for over 5 years now and have never had a bad pizza or bad experience dining in or taking out.  Pizzas are the best around-- thin crust has a nice crunchy crust and slightly sweetened sauce.  Toppings are fresh and good quality.  I&#39;ve had good pasta dinners as well-- the Rigatoni Spinachi has been a favorite.

Recently, I changed to a vegetarian diet and no longer eat meat or cheese.  While it&#39;s had to find healthy options like this at any pizza joint in town, Pasta Mia now has some gluten-free pasta entrees and they were easily able to accomodate my needs with a nice veggie pasta dish.

The crust edge is a wonderful combination of crispy and fluffy, like a warm roll that perfectly complements the rest of the ingredients.  The sauce is delicious and in just the right proportion to the other ingredients.  They don&#39;t skimp on the cheese either.

Pro tip: They have a coupon for 50% off pizza on Mondays if you are looking to save a few bucks.

 I have occasionally stayed to eat my pizza, but the beer selection is terrible.  They have Miller Lite and Leinie&#39;s Red on tap, with a couple of other undrinkable bottled beers.  Good beer is a requirement for me when eating pizza and I have plenty at my house.

I do occasionally eat in when I am in the mood for pasta.  Pasta Mia is very small.  The tables are very close together and there are not many of them.  Despite the limited seating, this place seems to be very popular for children&#39;s sporting team events.  I really hate the nights when I am unlucky enough to walk in on that scene.

There is not a dedicated hostess station, but you will be greeted by someone behind the counter as you walk in.  There is a stack of menus on the counter.  You can just grab a couple and seat yourself.  

The servers are all very nice.  Even when the place is packed, I always get pretty good service.  Some of the young waitresses don&#39;t know anything about beer or wine, but I suppose that is more the fault of our Puritan laws.

The pasta dishes I have had over the years are always tasty.  This is not the fanciest Italian food you will ever eat, but it is a good, solid effort.  The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable.  Each meal comes with bread and soup as well.
 
I don&#39;t often get dessert, but the Italian ice is very good.  The tiramisu comes in a little disposable plastic dish.  I don&#39;t know where they get it from and I don&#39;t like the fast food presentation, but it is good.

I have also used Pasta Mia to cater a house party.  The ordering process was easy and they delivered big steaming containers of delicious food such as eggplant parmesan and chicken marsala  directly to my kitchen.  The prices for this service were very reasonable and everyone loved the food.  They definitely made my party a success.

Overall I am definitely a fan of Pasta Mia.  I have been a customer since I moved to Bartlett in 2004 and I hope we continue a long and pizza filled relationship.  If only they had a better beer selection, then this would be a 5 star place."

Not bad, but not great.  The pizza is very good.  Anytime we order, its cooked as we ask and delivered when promised.  While there may be other pizzas I prefer, Pasta Mia is consistant with an above average product.

The principal reason that I spend my money with Pasta Mia is their very high level of commitment to youth sports.  I coach Football, Baseball, and Wrestling in the community and it always seems that Pasta Mia shows up more times than not on the sponsor list.  This goes a long way with me and I appreciate their efforts in the community and the role they play in making Bartlett youth sports some of the best around.

Thank you Pasta Mia."

Due to the abundance of Italians in the area, the western &#39;burbs are blessed with lots of good Italian restaurants, and Pasta Mia is one of them.

The restaurant itself is a pretty casual place. Service was on time, and friendly. I think it&#39;s a little dark inside, which is... odd... considering how much of the exterior walls are devoted to windows, but that&#39;s just me.

But on to the food. Calamari was surprisingly good; the batter wasn&#39;t overly complex, but it was crispy, and the squid very fresh. It helps that the tomato sauce tasted fresh, and that they give you 3 lemon wedges with it.

I had a simple broth-based pasta dish with broccoli, shrimp and lots and lots and LOTS of garlic. Very good. My wife had a thin crust sausage pizza that came out as a chewy thin crust, but an absolutely unbeatable cheese mixture. (I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they used some of that fontinella in the cheese mix.)

On the way I got to see some of the other flavors of pizza they have to try - eggplant and fontinella sounds like a winner, as well as a pizza/Italian meatball hybrid. This is definitely a place I would check out over lunch someday."

It seems since the expansion, the service has really declined. Friendly, but not organized and not enough servers. Plus, just found out that they recently put all high top tables/chairs on the older side of the place. I don&#39;t know many people that like to sit on those. Might be a bad idea, since that means less regular tables. Very loud inside since the ceilings are high and open.
We went to restaurant last night (for first time in about a year...since last time we went was awful). It took forever just to get bread and soup. When the soup came, it was room temp. It was good and we were all hungry, so we ate it and told the server later. She said she&#39;d turn up the heat. Don&#39;t know if that actually happened. Our entrees came pretty fast after the soup (since it took so long to get that). Food was ok. Not that tasty. Had to keep adding salt/pepper. Wish I had other spices to add. My husband had chicken parm and he said the chicken was delicious, but the marinara sauce had no flavor...just pureed tomato sauce. 
They were out of two of our favorite desserts, which was disappointing. But, what we did have (Nanis Casadetti), was delicious.
Don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be giving this place another chance. There are many other Italian restaurants that are a lot better (even Olive Garden)."

Their promo on Mondays is half price pizza but is kept a secret unless you ask for it and will charge you full price.  I was told by the kid manager that the phone girls will not offer that information.  He did not offer any apology or compensation for being misled.  I also requested my pizza pie cut and when I got it half was pie cut and half was squares.  He said he would send another one out BUT required the wrong one back which my hungry family had already started to eat.  He then said there was nothing he was willing to do.  This is why our pizza place of choice is V &amp;V !

You have way too many better choices for pizza in Bartlett. They are rude to customers and the prices are sky high !
I find it hard to believe that people eat there, the owner parks his brand new car right at the front door so you can see that you are making his car payments.
If you must go there just beware you have been warned."

When my husband and I first moved to Bartlett, we were worried about finding a good pizza place, but luckily, Pasta Mia was there. 

Their pizza toppings are always wonderful quality--whether it&#39;s the sausage or the eggplant or the ricotta cheese. I would say they could use more meat when it&#39;s ordered, but that seems to be the trend at all pizza places these days. 

I normally order my own pizza because I mainly like veggie pizzas. I suggest the Quattro Formaggi pizza which has four cheeses, fresh sliced tomato and fresh basil leaves on top. I also suggest the eggplant if you&#39;re looking to replace the meat on your pizza.

For under $6, you can get a sandwich with a side of fries or potato salad. I&#39;ve had all of their sandwiches and love them. I recommend the potato salad--it tastes homemade--like someone made it for a picnic. 

Although there is a sit-down area inside, it&#39;s not like going to a sit down restaurant, which I like, but if you&#39;re looking for ambience, it&#39;s not the place.

Finally, there&#39;s always coupons in the paper or Coupon Clipper, so make sure to take advantage. Just today, we ordered more than $25 and got $10 off. If you order a larger pizza, you get a free small cheese pizza.

Overall, a great place in Bartlett to get a pizza or a sandwich for reasonable prices."

No one at hostess stand upon entering, informed waitress that we needed a &#34;to go&#34; order asap due to a fussy baby.  Order did not come out for 50 minutes and came AFTER the entire table was served.  I requested to have the &#34;to go&#34; order taken off the bill by the assistant manager.  After he spoke to Paul Jr. the manager, I was told NO Paul Jr. would not comp the 2 Italian Beef sandwiches-Really?  Really?! Our total bill was over $160 and he couldn&#39;t take of a measly $16?!? The waitress was willing to take pay for the sandwiches, the waitress!  Poor, Poor management to allow this to happen. Manager never came out to speak to me about the situation, but sent his response through his minion out front.  The place was dirty, food was below average, service poor and no customer service what so ever.  This was a going away dinner for parents moving to Arizona, our party of ten will never go back and we will each tell at least 3 people who in turn will tell their friends-the number grows and grows.  Sadly this is the type of place that will fail if management continues to treat paying customers like crap, service doesn&#39;t improve, quality of food isn&#39;t improved to above average and the place isn&#39;t kept clean.  Don&#39;t waste your hard earned money at this place."

The staff was very kind and accommodating and they were able to reserve a section of their restaurant just for me and my guests at the last minute on a busy Saturday night.  I also had a $25 Restaurant.com coupon so I didn&#39;t feel like I was taking advantage of my friends just because it was my birthday.  

    Anyways, Pasta Mia is one of those family owned, small Italian eateries in my neighborhood.  From first glance, the place is nothing out of the ordinary, conveniently located inside a shopping center in Bartlett.  I love coming here for their food.  It is one of the best authentic tasting Italian restaurants close to the house.  The food is very tasty and authentic, and the portions are always huge.

   When I come here, I always get the Eggplant Rolls, stuffed with ricotta and smothered with marina sauce for $5.50  You get 4 large eggplant rolls, enough for 4 people.  If you want, you can get this as your entrée....it is that good.   One of my other favorite is their fried Calamari drenched in Jardonaire.  If you love spicy food and calamarie, this is definitely not one to be missed.  It is not always on their menu so ask the waitress if they have it on their menu.

    I have tried a number of their pastas and antipastos, and have loved them all. But on my Birthday this past Saturday, I had ordered the Clam Linguini in Red clam sauce, and it perfectly complimented my Calamari appetizer.  This place is one of those hidden Italian gems that not too many people know about."

I feel like the food is not consistent. The first time I was here my meal was great.  The fresh bed they served was...well fresh...and hot and soft and Ohhhh so good.  I&#39;ve been there several times since and my meal has not once lived up to the first experience. I&#39;ve never again been served warm bread, and one of the times the bread was so hard we couldn&#39;t eat it. And at the end of our last meal here we noticed the table next to us had oil with their bread...we were never offered oil on any of our visits. I&#39;d say I know to ask next time but it will probably be a long while before we give them another shot. A plus for them is that I think this would be a really good place to host a wedding/bridal shower. The restaurant kind of splits in half so I&#39;m sure they could reserve one half for a party. I&#39;m not sure they do this, but I took note of that on my last visit."

I stand by my positive points of having a local restaurant.  I have also since met who appears to be the owner and he was a very nice guy.  The girl servers are all very friendly and personable.  However I have had a couple of experiences that just prevent me from giving more stars.

I went in for dinner one evening (actually Halloween) with my daughter and some friends.  The kitchen was obviously slammed with orders as the entrance was crowded with people waiting for pizzas.  We were one of three tables in the dining room.  After we sat down and didn&#39;t have our drink orders taken for about five minutes we decided to leave.  It was late and my friend is a diabetic and she needed to get some food in her.  As we were leaving the server came out, I explained we were going to go because it seemed like they were slammed.  He seemed irritated and said they were busy with pizzas but the kitchen was fine.  We opted to leave anyway.  It turned out to be a good decision as our other friend walked in shortly after we left and said they were stuck there waiting for their food (they did get pizza) for an hour and twenty minutes.

More irritating however, is the harassment I have received from Tim S. who appears to be associated with Pasta Mia in some way, I have had the below exchanges with him:

Tim S.a year ago-

I was searching google for reviews for Pasta Mia, and I came across yours. First of all I would like to apologize to you again for the level of service you received on 8/12/2010. I am the General Manager of the all 3 locations, and am aware of what happened. I just wanted you to know the other side of the story. Your server, &#34;Mr.Twitch&#34;, was running 9 tables at the time. Yes, that night we were understaffed. However, you cannot plan on that volume of business especially on a Thursday night. That Thursday night was like a Friday night for us. On Friday nights we have 4 servers for 22 tables and also 4 cooks in the kitchen, 3 pizza cooks, 2 answering phones, 2 managers and 3 drivers. That Thursday we had 2 servers, 1 manager, 2 kitchen cooks, 1 pizza cook and 2 drivers. The manager on duty was actually the owner and was helping in the kitchen as well. That is why it took a while for your food, and a 15% discount was applied to make up for that. Your server applied that discount without asking the owner, and he was very honest and sincere with his apology.  I do hope your server got your order correct and everything tasted to expectations. As far as the &#34;Pee Dance&#34; I know what you are talking about, my 4 year old does it too. I think your server just stands with his legs crossed like that sometimes. Your server works about 65hours (by choice) a week to support his family, he is on his feet a lot and I guess that is comfortable for him. He looked &#34;more crazed&#34; because he was running 9 tables and was running around like a mad man in order to do a good job for his tables so he can make tips to supplement his regular income. Bad service = bad tips. He has another little one on the way next week, and the only things he thinks about is supporting his family and doing the best he can at his job so he has the means to be able to support them. Anyway, again I am sorry for your experience at Pasta Mia, please come back and see us again sometime. 

Sincerely, 
Andrew Linck aka &#34;Mr. Twitch&#34;

Tim S.a month ago-

&#34;I wish someone could write a review on your fake, stupid bitchy ass.  It&#39;s people like you who hide behind computers and say stupid ass shit all the time... &#34;I work in the credit card industry&#34;  WTF does that even mean??? I suppose if you did, you would know that the correct action the owner should have taken would be to call the credit card company and report it lost and they would have instructed him to destroy the card.  You Olive Oyl looking twig, work on your imperfections FIRST, maybe you can get a blue star for that.....&#34;

 Julie B.a moment ago- 

&#34;Wow Tim, great come back. 

You are correct, the proper thing to do would be to destroy the card. However, good business owners have common sense to know that perhaps their paying customers would like to come back and use that card again at their establishment. 

I don&#39;t hide behind my computer and say stupid ass shit all the time, on the contrary I only review when I think an experience warrants it. 

I wish you well in all your endeavors, sorry you are such a hateful little person.&#34;"

We loved it because it was a new place for me and my husband to come and have a drink or two without the kiddos in tow and it&#39;s right down the street from us.  But....the way they blacked out the windows now is a bit intimidating.   It&#39;s usually a bit crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, so before when we want to come we kind of look inside as we drive by to see if the bar side is super crowded.  If it is, well, we go somewhere else.  Now we can&#39;t even see inside because they blacked out the windows.  Once, and only once, we walked in, it was too crowded and we left to go somewhere else.  We don&#39;t want to have to walk in everytime we decide we might want to go there.  I also noticed they have a new sign on their window....an &#34;Open&#34; sign.  Gee, I wonder why.....

Tonight was not a good experience. There was about 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant section when we entered.

It took almost 10 minutes after we were seated by a young host who took our drink orders. The waitress, Amanda,  that eventually approached our table, was previously giggling and talking behind the main counter with other servers. When we placed our orders we asked about soups, she quips clam chowder .. she doesn&#39;t mention the other soups, that I later learned,  are available that night .We asked what came with the ribs, she snips &#34;only fries&#34;. In the past we always had a choice given. We asked she go back to the kitchen and ask what our choices are. A while later she comes back and again barks &#34;out of ribs&#34;. We had it with her attitude, so we got up and started to leave. As we were walking out the door a thin blond asks us how was our dinner. After she confirmed she was a manager I gave her some examples of the waitress&#39;s rude attitude, Amanda overhears and runs over to challenge us with &#34;how was I rude&#34;. Maybe the owner may have handled it better, but as I looked over my shoulder, as we exited, the blond and waitress Amanda were laughing and smiling with each other... so much for professionalism and respect in the treatment of your customers. ...by the way, we had a great experience down the street at Savory restaurant."

  We recently had a sit down meal on a Thursday evening when I craved a good sandwich and the wife wanted some pasta. Skipped all other restaurants in town, went here knowing best, and ordered their steak sandwich.  Simple Pizza bread appetizer arrive15 minutes  after ordering. Steak it self was very cold and over cooked.  Sent it back, and was returned to me within 3 minutes, same piece heated on the grill and was under seasoned.  My wife ordered a simple Alfredo pasta and she commented that she&#39;d had better at local chain restaurants.  What&#39;s most concerning is that things appear to be precooked and reheated. The alfredo sauce sounds like it was out of the jar. 

  Unfortunately, the ingredients  and detail to quality has gotten worse over the past year.  Pizza is either burnt or under cooked... yes that can happen. Cheese quality has changed and only the owner(s) will know why!  The family was going to this place for over 3 years now and once upon a time officially claimed this the best pizza joint in Bartlett to all our friends and family. NO MORE

Stick to simple marinara dishes, but know that it will not taste like anyone&#39;s mother is truly cooking this, but rather just some random staff in the back.

I know some personally that tried to schedule a party during a 1/2 price pizza promo. There was nothing stating it as not for large group. Even when it was confirmed it was stated they would honor it. Then they received call that they will not after confirming everything. So wrong! Where is old school customer service. Is one party worth a weekly order from a group of long standing clients? Makes me rethink ordering there again.

The restaurant seating area is relatively small, but that doesn&#39;t keep people from packing the place on a busy Friday/Saturday night. As you might gather from the name, the pasta is a major draw here. The servings of largely Italian-based pasta dishes are very generous, and should almost automatically be accompanied by a to-go container. 

The pizza here should definitely not be overlooked, as it&#39;s also very decent. If you&#39;re looking for a quick lunch, stop in and order a slice and they&#39;ll cut a generous slice out of a finished pizza on presentation on their large serving counter. They&#39;ll give it a quick blast in the oven and pack it up for you and you&#39;re on your way. If you have the time to fight the crowds on a weekend, the fresh pizza is really the way to go. I&#39;ve had a good experience with it nearly every time.

Pasta mia is very popular with local kids sports teams after games, and it&#39;s not uncommon for big crowds to roll in/out as their evening events finish up."

Cute place, lots of country kitschy &#34;charm&#34; if you&#39;re into that. Comfortable booth, attentive service (though I wouldn&#39;t call her cheerful, I sure as heck wouldn&#39;t be cheerful either on my feet all day bringing people their food), strong coffee, and bonus points for flavored coffee crack options , err, creamer, on the table. 

My skillet was tasty, and I love that they had a make your own option so I could customize to my picky heart&#39;s content. The husband liked his fajita frittata that he said was excellent, and I also liked that I could have pancakes instead of toast with my skillet.

The inside looks and feels like your local breakfast stop. This is the kind of cafe that already has empty mugs sitting on your table while a waiter walks up with a pot of coffee assuming you want a pour.

I&#39;ve tried multiple menu items and all were satisfying. If you show up for lunch, give the BLT a shot, trust me.

Once you&#39;re finished, you take your bill up to the cash register on your way out. Overall, it&#39;s a homey place to dine with solid food that&#39;s sure to fill you up."

It had different veggies than you usually fine (and plenty of them), and the cheese was on top (also different).  However, the reason we will likely not be back here is because they charged FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS for two scrambled eggs for my son.  He tends to order eggs a la cart like this, so I am not unfamiliar with paying that way.  But I have never been some place that charges me this much (even with places that had an up charge for eggs during the price increase).

This is quite unfortunate because we&#39;ve been there many times since they opened years ago. Generally, the food and service have been very good. But, today, Mother&#39;s Day, we got a better look at how they feel about their customers and it was not pretty. But, if I were rating our server, she would rate very highly. 

The story goes something like this - since it was Mother&#39;s Day, we made reservations ahead of time. Monday, my daughter called and set up a table for us at 11 AM for brunch. When we arrived, they did not have our reservation. There was a long wait, but they did manage to get in after only a short wait.

We ordered right away. Since our whole family was together, we spent time talking and even ran into some friends who were also there. Before we knew it, 40 minutes had gone by. We flagged down our waitress who said she would check on the food. It came right out.

It was pretty obvious that the food had been sitting around for a while. I ordered a club sandwich and fries. The french fries were cold. My daughter ordered an omelet and specifically ordered it with no cheese. When it arrived, we noticed cheese shreds were sprinkled on top. We called over the waitress who apologized and took it back. She said she would rush the order since we&#39;d been waiting for so long already. A minute or two went by and the waitress returned. The manager send her back to tell us that there was no cheese in the omelet. She pointed out the shredded cheese which she acknowledged and took it back again. Another few minutes went by and she returned again - this time the omelet was cut open. The manager sent her back again to show us there was no cheese inside.

In my life I have never experienced a case where a manager puts there employee into such an awkward circumstance and blames their error on their customer. It was clear that there was no cheese inside, there was cheese on top which management refused to acknowledge at all. She said they would remake it and I asked for her to have the manager come by our table. The manager did not acknowledge us and in fact, never came back to our side of the restaurant.

When you check out at Egg&#39;lectic, you pay at the register. The hostess asked how our meal was and I asked her if she really wanted to know? I asked to speak to the manager. She went back to get her, but instead the owner came out. I explained what happened, and she also argued with us about the food. She told the hostess to take 10% off of our bill (my daughter said it should be free). But, I told her that I was not looking for any money off, I just wanted an apology. She was unwilling to admit they did anything wrong.

Restaurants are great places to go to for a meal out. But, half of the meal is the experience. This was not a great experience. I would give them one star if the waitress had not been so professional and had not tried to resolve the situation."

Quiet, a little run down, but the staff was very friendly, coffee was good and as far as the food goes, it was good.  Best thing for me was the biscuit in the biscuits and gravy I had.  It was really light and fluffy and melted in my mouth, came with diced potatoes.  What kind of disappointed me was that the food was not hot.  It was warm - if that much.

Full disclosure: it wasn&#39;t our first choice. We were at Woodfield and tried to go to that other breakfast restaurant that shall not be named but rhymes with smilegary. The wait there was ridiculous. Like, standing room only, but you can&#39;t even stand comfortably. I called Egg&#39;lectic and asked what the wait was, and they said barely 5 minutes, so we bolted. 

I am so glad we decided to come here! My only gripe was that the booth we sat in was a little tight. I&#39;m a pretty tall chick with uber-long legs, so I had some trouble here. I couldn&#39;t cross my legs without banging them on the bottom of the table, and I couldn&#39;t sit without them crossed unless I wanted to be playing ultimate footsie with my mom. Next time, I&#39;ll ask to sit at a table instead of a booth.

Our waitress was the sweetest girl, especially for being as busy as she was. The food was outstanding for the price. My mom and I both ordered the farmhouse, which is biscuits and gravy with two eggs and hash browns. I was expecting one biscuit cut in half, since there was so much more involved in the meal. Nope! It was a full order of B&amp;G (two biscuits), plus a full order of hash browns (like half the plate and overlapping onto the biscuits), and my eggs were poached perfectly! Needless to say, there was plenty to bring home as leftovers. I also had a large fresh-squeezed OJ, which was delightful and didn&#39;t break the bank. For the two of us, the bill came to 19 bucks. Worth every penny!"

It took kind of a long time for her to initially come around. I will say, it looked as if she were the only waiter dueing the shift, however, maybe 4 table were being waited on and I saw a few times the workers standing around. It even took a while to get our check. I usually order eggs benedict and this time, the egg was over cooked and the hollandaise sauce tasted odd. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be coming back."

Stayed down the street with the family for a few days and ate here twice! I had the same thing both times because it was so good. I ordered the Irish Benny which is corned beef hash on an English muffin topped with egg and hollandaise sauce with a side of hash browns. Seriously good eats. The service is kinda off as we waited awhile before our server came to take our order both times. However we were seated quickly and food came out fast as well.

I tried the California Omelet with hash browns and pancakes instead of toast which was a massive amount of food for breakfast- I was glad we went later in the morning because it lasted me through lunch too. The mix of the swiss, jack and cheddar cheeses with sour cream on the side made a delightful topping.

Parking on a Sunday apparently can be a bit of a problem, but a tip if you can&#39;t find parking is that there is an extension to the parking lot in the BACK of the restaurant building that when we visited was mostly empty.

The only negative- and it is a very small one for me, is that the items we were served weren&#39;t as &#34;picture perfect&#34; and beautifully plated as the more upscale breakfast places in the area. The items we ordered looked largely homestyle ordinary but the TASTE was extraordinary. I am not so picky that my meals have to be art on a plate- I just want something tasty that will stick to my ribs and that certainly is what we got.

I felt the prices were good to slightly inexpensive considering what we got for the money. 

Overall we were very pleased with Egg&#39;clectic Cafe and I feel that it is worth putting on your &#34;to try&#34; list."

I had not been here in a while, so I was hoping the experience would be just as good. 

I&#39;m still impressed with the amount of items to choose from on their menu. I decided to get the special for the day, which was a Mediterranean benedict. I knew right away this was either going to be terrible, or amazing. Had it not been for the home-made hollandaise, it would have been great. Maybe I&#39;m just not a fan of the home-made hollandaise (although I think I have had it before at other places and liked it), but the sauce ruined the taste of everything. Everyone else seemed to like what they got, so I&#39;m thinking this was just not my dish.

The service was a little slow. For not being that busy, we had to ask for refills on coffee and water and had to remind them about a plate of pancakes.

Have yet to find another breakfast joint that gets it just right. I prefer the Florentine over the regular, but I&#39;m a veggie over meat type of gal anyway. Another favorite is the Veggie Skillet, which I usually swap out the cheese for feta instead, though both ways are delish. When it comes to pancakes, it&#39;s easy to disappoint with multigrain batter. Well not here!! Spot on perfection. For lunch, my fav is the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, no bleu cheese, sub their HOMEMADE ranch instead. Which, by the way, is also perfect to pretty much dip and dunk anything in (especially their golden onion chips *drool). Tied for first place (lunch) is also the Pot Roast Sandwich, which also tastes great accompanied by above referenced ranch.

Like you, I searched Yelp for help in selecting a place to enjoy breakfast.  My choice was Wildberry because of the reviews.  It was in a shopping mall and I got what the Yelpers told me: a half hour wait. There was also a wait for the food to get to the table and a relatively good breakfast.  This time we tried Egg&#34;lectric.   This review is for a weekday breakfast at both. Do not assume weekends will be the same. 

We were able to park in their parking lot and received a friendly greeting on the way in and a friendly thank you on the way out. As an aside, when we got to Wildberry the young liberally inked (tattooed) person was too busy chatting with other workers to say hello. Back to Egg&#39;lectric.  It is clean, but the decor has not been touched lately. I intend to eat the food not drink in the beauty of my surrounding at breakfast. I want a relaxing meal. That is what I got. I had Eggs Benedict with a thick slice of ham...not Canadian Bacon.  The eggs were perfect. At Wildberry they were just able to emit a little wet yoke. When my companion asked about the ability to make the Quesadilla with eggs and bacon a wrap she said we will be happy to give it to you.  So what I am attempting to convey is if you want a relaxing week day breakfast, at a reasonable price,  without fighting the crowd and standing for half an hour this is a better choice.     My companion, Tonto agrees."

Problem is, many of said diners/breakfast locales are just ok. And while I don&#39;t need Wildberry every weekend, I often crave their creative dishes. What I do not crave is the asinine wait that forms every.single.weekend. Thus, I&#39;m always on the lookout for tasty substitutes. And overall, Egg&#39;lectic is solid. And technically in Rolling Meadows. 

Inside, Egg&#39;lectic is country kitsch without meaning to be kitsch. Know what I mean? It&#39;s comfortable, spacious and a welcome respite from crowds. The menu is pretty impressive - deep with options that will likely please any picky palate - a multitude of creative omelets, fritattas, oatmeal, pancakes, scramblers, crepes, combos and more. If you&#39;re feeling indecisive, I bet you&#39;ll have a helluva time making your b-fast decision.

I often steer towards the sweet side of a breakfast menu, thus went with the blackberry-banana pancakes. The pancakes were hearty in size and flavor, and the fresh blackberries and bananas made for a tasty combination. Nothing too crazy, just a nice stack of carb with fruit - no fanfare in the presentation. My main issue with the combo breakfast was the eggs that came with the pancakes. The eggs were pretty gummy - akin to those you may scrape out from the bottom of a chafing dish at a hotel buffet. Perhaps they sat under the heat lamp too long?

Regardless, Egg&#39;lectic offers a really deep menu for all you breakfast lovers out there. If you find yourself hangry in Arlington Heights/Rolling Meadow, it&#39;s certainly worth a try!"

One day, I decided to give it a try with some co-workers and boy was I glad I did! They have every possible breakfast item and many lunch items. It took me 15 minutes to decide- we went at 12 but they serve breakfast all day! 

I ended up getting the cinnamon apple French toast and OMG it was delish! There was a whole lot of food on that plate! It came out piping hot and the heat was warming up the apples from crunchy to soft which made them even sweeter as they melted in your mouth. But every now and then you would get a crunch apple. My mouth is watering as I recall this meal! Most of my colleagues got savory breakfast items and theirs were just as good. Bacon was thick but not too thick. Service was great. We ordered a to-go item and it was ready as we finished our meal. I would come here again anyday!"

Sunday we tried Egg&#39;letic Cafe.  The interior is bright and open and not as cramped as a lot of other places are on a Sunday morning.  The wait was less than five minutes, the food was good and service was friendly and prompt. 

My daughter had the plain creeps with blueberries which she enjoyed but the blueberries were just okay and she didn&#39;t eat them.   Tasted like they had been frozen and were mushy.  My wife&#39;s stuffed French toast was excellent.  I went with the Ironman Omelette for something a bit healthier and enjoyed it.   

Prices are fair, food is good but equal at best to a couple of other local and popular breakfast and brunch places.   Overall a good spot that we will be back to."

I discovered this location thanks to Yelp (woot!!) and my husband insisted that we go the very next day (which just happened to be New Year&#39;s Eve).

My husband&#39;s FAVORITE breakfast place is Egg&#39;lectic cafe, and his favorite thing to order is the Banana Nut Bread French Toast Combo.  He gets it w/ eggs over hard, and it comes with two slices of toast.  This is his tried and true meal, and he has yet to sway from it! :)

I, however, try something different every time, and I have yet to be disappointed!  I got the healthy scrambler w/ the potatoes and substituted peppers for spinach with no extra charge.  Gotta love it!!

The kids ordered french toast and one of their specials--oatmeal pancakes!  They had oats and raisins in them and were delicious.  The french toast was standard fare--not bad, just nothing to write home about!

As for my scrambler--YUM!!  You never know how these are going to turn out--some are tasteless, some are greasy, but this one was delicious!!  There&#39;s nothing worse than ordering a &#34;healthy&#34; scrambler and have it swimming in grease, but Egg&#39;lectic understands that!  It wasn&#39;t overly-oiled and was still delicious!  The potatoes were a good compliment!

For the four of us, it was $37 including tip, and my husband was even offered a cup of coffee to go.  What a nice touch!!

We will definitely be back!"

Here&#39;s your answer to break-fast without the 2 hour wait (which is also known as brunch... also known as Wildberry wait expectations). At Egg&#39;lectic we got right in. I even saw 3 other couples come into EC while we were dining who I had also seen standing for tables at Wildberry when I went in to check on the wait time. Apparently, this is THE place to go if you get rejected by the insanely popular W-Berry. 

Like any warm-blooded Schaumburg area-n, I love to eat at Wildberry. It&#39;s one of the only reasons I get up before 3pm on the weekends and one  of the main reasons I, sadly, won&#39;t be cutting weight this summer. But sometimes, unfortunate things happen and I can&#39;t always get a table at Wildberry that doesn&#39;t come with a ridiculous wait time, that my morning-mate will not tolerate. It was after one of these occasions that we luckily discovered Egg&#39;lectic Cafe. 

With a HUGE menu and items that, like Wildberry, are a bit more imaginative than your average B-fast menu, I quickly forgot about feeling like a pre-lunch loser who didn&#39;t get on the list. With your pick of flavored coffee creamers (mix the hazelnut and chocolate!) and pages and pages to choose from, Egg&#39;lectic was quickly winning us over. The &#39;Hey Ricky&#39; omelet was packed with avocado- there had to have been at least 6 of those bad boys up in there. And the stuffed french toast was a real panty-creamer. They NEED to sell that passion fruit jam. I hate putting jam on my ish but I was literally eating it straight out of the bowl. My BF tried to stop me because he thought it was gross, then I made him try the jam and he changed his tune. He was then trying to stop me because he wanted to eat it on it&#39;s own, too. SO good. The plates here come a little less dressed up than at Wb, and overall, nothing is as fancy or modern, or even clean, but the food is just as good and you don&#39;t have to wait 2 days to get a seat to eat it. 

We will definitely be back. Next time I&#39;m ordering a bowl of that passion-fruit jam, though. And maybe the Cap&#39;n Crunch French Toast, too!"

They have the absolute best Chicken tortilla soup from here to the Himalayas. I wish they would open a place closer to my office, because I would have lunch here once a week. And lunch would include a vat of their chicken soup and a club sandwich. They have yummy fries and delicious breakfast items. I know this because I drooled at each of them as they passed our table.

I am not much of a breakfast person, so their lunch options appease me. My fiance ordered the cinnamon roll french toast and looooooved it! The only thing I would mention is that their breakfast sausage was just average. I would either order it well done or get bacon instead. Their bacon was pretty decent.

They had a number of items on the menu that I would try but since having had their soup, I think I will stick with lunch. They have crepes which I know everyone loves, waffle, pastries and skillets. Their menu is pretty extensive.

My fiance tossed around the Red Velvet french toast idea that sounded good, but he was more than happy with what he ended up with. My sister opted for lunch as well. She rocked a chicken sandwich with bacon and a side of onion petals. The toast came out all buttered up, and she didn&#39;t want that buttered so she ordered fresh toast plain. Don&#39;t worry though, my guy snatched up that buttered toast and ate almost all of it. Evidently, it was good. 

I think after reliving our experience, I want to go back soon. Hope that soup is ready!!"

Based on reviews and since Katie&#39;s Kitchen had already closed for the day, this was our next choice.  If you can make it into the dining room even at 2 minutes before closing time, they will still serve you.  Luckily we were one of three tables so we got everything fairly quickly and they didn&#39;t cheap out on anything being that it was already closing time.  Once they took the order and brought out the basics, they let us know how much time we&#39;d be waiting.  Our waitress was kinda aloof, of course it was closing time, but, the runner and the hostess helped us more often then our waitress.

Nice, welcoming atmosphere makes me think of a comfort food environment and reminds me of the typical restaurants found along expressways.  The table tops are red and white checkered which to me reminds of pizza, although that is not served here.  Food was better than average and we could see why this restaurant is highly rated in this area.  Not a decision I would make again though, it was good not great.  Some of the flavors weren&#39;t appealing to us and since both of us got different Eggs Benny&#39;s, we found the hollandaise had an almost sweet taste to it which is a first for the both of us.  The highlight for me would have been the fresh crepe filled with Gnutella and topped with sliced bananas, which again was just okay.  With your brunch entree comes hash browns or house potatoes and fresh fruit.  The meal is filling and you can leave with a food coma.  

This restaurant has its own parking lot and I guess sometimes it can get so busy that there is spill over into the next restaurants adjoining parking lot.  Which you shouldn&#39;t do unless you have money to cover your car towing cost."

We called about a week ahead for seating on a Sunday afternoon. The tables were preset so that was a plus. We ordered some appetizers and they were fine. Nothing memorable to even share. 

The pizza was another thing. The crust tasted undercooked and made the pizza inedible to me. Our guests were so entranced by the thick stringy cheese every time we served a slice. They aren&#39;t familiar with food pizza and they didn&#39;t say much.

I got the cheesy garlic bread and bacon BBQ chicken stuffed (deep dish) pizza

cheesy garlic bread-

   nice blend of cheese, can taste the garlic bread, crisp

marinara sauce 
nice tang like classic marinara


bacon BBQ chicken-

crisp bacon
juicy chicken
onions meh? ( not much and over masked by the BBQ sauce
BBQ sauce very light 
Crust was a bit too thick and had a weird crunch to it
nice blend overall 

Over all the food was yummy but I do prefer Lou&#39;s better"

Only a few others in the place.  After a while (20-30min) we are told that they made the wrong size pie and are remaking it.  The manager never stopped by to apologize, nor did they bring a slice or bring the wrong one out while we are waiting.

Then when we went to check out they refused to accept an online $5 off coupon, because it was online; even though they pay to offer and advertise.  The manager Natalie stated that the code on coupon is useless and not used by them. She could care less about customer satisfaction, even in the event of  the delay in order. $30 for one pizza and a coffee and they wont budge on a $5 coupon they pay to advertise. Dont tell me that the manager cant deduct $ from the bill.

This was my first for eating Giordino&#39;s take on Chicago style stuffed pizza and I was not very impressed. We ordered the &#34;Special&#34; with green peppers, sausage and onions as well as an antipasta salad and calamari side.

The antipasto salad was very good and loaded with great ingredients and the calamari was cooked correctly and had good flavor.

On the Pizza - 
&#34;DISAPPOINTING&#34; would be the best word to describe the Giordino&#39;s stuffed pizza - there was an overabundance of large onion pieces, very little green pepper and almost no sausage (I found 2 dime size pieces of sausage in the slice I had) and an unremarkable flavor to the sauce and crust. Basically an onion pizza with lots of cheese and basic crust that cost $19.75 for a small. 

Bottom Line - Wouldn&#39;t come here again for pizza (would stick with Lou Malnati&#39;s) but might come back for other items if everywhere else was busy."

Giordano&#39;s was best all around. Sauce was flavorful, Sausage patty was substantial and very tasty, cheese layer was stringy and thick as hell, and best of all the crust was flaky, not too thick, and not oily or greasy. Pricing is moderate.
Lou Malnati&#39;s was delicious as well, but the crust was very buttery and left my hands with a layer of grease. The pizza at Lou&#39;s was the least expensive of the 3.
Ginos&#39; fillings were decent, but the crust lost it for us as it was extremely doughy and thick, not flaky in the least."

New Yorker born and raised, and I can say this is the best pizza I&#39;ve had outside of New York City.  It&#39;s a little different than how we do it, but it&#39;s a nice alternative.

It took about 10 minutes for our appetizer (bruschetta) which was ok, but it took about 45 minutes for our pizza to come to the table after ordering.  Mind you, when we were greeted at the front door, the gentleman said &#34;You guys are the first people to sit down in over 40 minutes&#34;.  The place was not packed at all.

The bruschetta was very good.  I didn&#39;t care much for the balsamic drizzle, and it would have tasted much better without it.

The pizza was pretty good.  The crust was not oily at all, the cheese was in the middle and the top of the pie was covered in sauce.  The mozzarella was high grade, you could taste it.  A lot of places in the city use cheap, garbage mozzarella.  The sauce was pretty flavorful as well.  My only gripe is that the outter crust, what us New Yorkers would grip this thing by, is extremely dry and hard.  The dough on the bottom was nice and soft.

Once we were done, it took about 15 minutes to get our waitresses attention for the check.

Food was great, service was eh.

I would love for places in New York to serve pizza like this, hopefully I can find one."

I think it is one of the best, if not the best pizza I have had in Chicagoland. This location has to be the most inconsistent one of the bunch. I have always had excellent pizza near the Michigan Avenue location, and also in St Charles/Geneva and Addison.

The thin crust is missing something. It&#39;s passable but I really won&#39;t go out of my way to order it. The deep dish is probably their specialty at this location and it is much better than the thin crust.

I guess my lack of superlatives tell the story about this place. I was pretty disappointed with my thin crust pizza this past weekend."

Giordano&#39;s offers full size entrees but half orders are also available. Both include your choice of soup or small salad, bread and butter. 

The downside of having food delivered is my bad habit for over-ordering and today was no different. Besides ordering Spinach Ravioli, I ordered an Individual Pizza stuffed with Spinach, Sausage and Sliced Tomatoes.

The Individual Stuffed Pizza is only available during lunch hours: 11am - 3pm. It&#39;s the size of the ones you find in your local Grocer&#39;s freezer. I like taking advantage of this offer.

The bar area was being set up for a private party so we left that area and went to the host area to be seated. Simple request, no? We had to ask the dual hosts three times to be seated. After we were seated it took several minutes before a waiter came to the table. He took our food order but failed to ask if we wanted drinks. My date did have a beverage from the bar but I guess I was meant to be thirsty. Fifty minutes later our perfectly delicious pizza was delivered. Hot, ooey, gooey awesomeness.

The house salad dressing was delicious.   The food however, leaves a lot to be desired.  My wife had a beef sandwich and I ordered a small cheese and sausage deep dish pizza.  When the pizza arrived, I had to dig around and found only one piece of sausage, I asked to speak to the manager.  Someone came over, didn&#39;t bother to introduce himself (I later found out his name was Horatio), and then spoke to me in a condescending manner - I might be 76 years old but I&#39;m not senile!!!   He told me &#34;you don&#39;t understand, the meat is underneath the cheese on the pizza&#34;; he proceeded to dissect the pizza and then said &#34;see that little gray thing - that&#39;s the meat&#34;.   I told him that I have had this type of pizza before and 1 and 1/2 pieces of meat on a slice is not acceptable!  I did not want to eat the pizza and certainly did not want to take it home!!   He refused to write it off the bill ( 5 out of 6 pieces left and the one he dissected sat on the plate); said he&#39;d take the cost of the meat off the pizza!!  I paid for a meal I could not eat!!   I will never return to Giordano&#39;s!!!!   Lou Malnati&#39;s  pizza has meat on it and they treat their customer&#39;s with respect!

Don&#39;t eat at Giordano&#39;s - you&#39;d be better off buying a DiGiornio  at the grocery store.

It&#39;s got that cute family joint feel with big open booths and Frank Sinatra playing in the background.  We were seated quickly, the waiter was friendly and didn&#39;t give us that oh-god-you-have-a-coupon look.  We ordered the large, stuffed Spinach Pie. 

 It takes 35 minutes to bake a stuffed pizza.  (It would&#39;ve been worth an hour.)  The sauce was the perfect blend of flavor and the pizza was DELICIOUS (that&#39;s right, in caps).  The five of us couldn&#39;t finish the pizza in one sitting.  (The leftovers didn&#39;t last long.)  This pizza *almost* makes me want to move here."

Although not my favorite, it&#39;s right up there.  I do like the stuffed pizza.  That is usually what we get there.  We get a medium and there is enough for both of us for that dinner, breakfast the next morning and a couple of lunches for me to take to work the following week.  We&#39;d like to try some of their other menu items, but we still keep getting the stuffed pizza.  This last time we got the fried zucchini.  Probably won&#39;t have that again, but there are other appetizers to try.

Service has been consistently good.  Never anything great, but still acceptable.

My only complaint is that this is a family restaurant.  This means kids.  Seems that no matter how hard we try, we end up with someone&#39;s demon spawn sitting right behind us.  Hey parents, how about doing some parenting and control the little bast...ummm...children.  Their screeching like Mariah Carey may be enthralling to you, but to most others is at best annoying, much like Mariah.

Other than the demon spawn, we like Giordano&#39;s and will be back for more Friday nights out for dinner."

Most recently we went on 1/2 price and trivia night. I will definitely go back for this combo again. Mister Trivia was hilarious and even though we were awful, he was kind and made some light-hearted jokes. The food was very good. I had filet sliders and had them sub in some crispy onion strings.

We ordered and our bruschetta came out decently fast. The bruschetta was the worst I have ever had. It was so full of onions it was almost unbearable. My mouth tasted like onions until we left and got fro yo. 

The cream of mushroom soup was fine. I dipped the bread in it and I enjoyed that. I ordered the alfredo. It wasn&#39;t horrible but it wasn&#39;t good or anything. I ate half of it. My husband got the chicken parm and he said it was bad. I tried the sauce and it tasted like Chef Boyardee.

I ordered a Diet Coke as we looked at the menu and it had lost its sweetness. I checked the date and it was outdated by 3 months. So I asked for (and got) another one which was OK. My biggest takeaway was the overwhelming  fragrance smell that hit me when I sat down. We were at the table farthest from the door inside the restaurant (and nearest to the restroom). It could have been a deodorizer in the bathroom, I don&#39;t know. All I know is that an hour after leaving, that sickening sweet/floral scent is still stuck in my nose. After 30 minutes,  I started breathing in through my mouth to avoid smelling that scent. My two friends were congested, so couldn&#39;t smell anything. 

The food was OK. I initially ordered the veggie lasagna until the waiter said it had no pasta, that it was just veggies and cheese. So I got a veggie panini instead and the bread (ciabatta) was outstanding. I would have bought some of that to bring home if I could. I got a cannoli which was also delicious. 

The food was OK, but between the scent and the bad Coke, I won&#39;t be back. I think my stuffed up friends thought it was OK. :)"

 Anyway, stopped in for lunch. I had a breaded steak sandwich which I think was called the Godfather or something. It was pretty big and pretty good. I liked the bread that it came on. In talking with the fellow who was working there, they make their own bread. It was very good. My dining mate had the Italian Beef and really liked that too.
I saw someone with lasagna and it looked good.
They had quite a few other items on the menu that I would like to try so I guess that I have to plan another visit soon.

I like that the menu isn&#39;t extensive or overwhelming. Though there aren&#39;t a ton of options to choose from, I think there&#39;s something for everybody here. 

I went around 2:30 on a Thursday for a late lunch and there was nobody there, probably because of the time I went. I wanted something simple and semi light, because I was having a big dinner later on that day. I ordered a chicken caesar salad and a bowl of their soup of the day which was pasta fagioli. I also got four cookies from the selection of baked goods by the register - they had a decent selection of sweets. My total for a pretty large salad, large bowl of soup and 4 cookies came out to about $20, so not too bad.

The salad had plenty of chicken which I love, because some places seem to skimp on chicken in their salads. There were almost no bites I took that didn&#39;t have chicken in them. The soup was delicious! Very hearty and filling with tons of beans and noodles. Would definitely order again. My meal also came with two garlic dinner rolls which were tasty. The cookies I got were delicious and tasted fresh. A good ending to a yummy meal. 

I will definitely be visiting again with my boyfriend, and am excited to try other things on their menu."

I was in a rush one day and wanted to try an Italian panini but didn&#39;t have time to sit in and have the whole dine in experience so I decided to do a carryout order. I came in on a Friday around noon and they had a few tables casually enjoying lunch. The place is small but there&#39;s definitely room to have a nice quiet lunch if you&#39;re in the area. Here was the issue and thank god for the fact that I did carryout but it was scorching hot in there. I know it&#39;s not exactly summer time but why have the heat blasting, that would have caused me to have a very uncomfortable eat in experience. I ordered the fig panini as it looked delicious to go, one of their fresh cannolis and a few of the cookies they had in the display case. The cookies are a little on the pricier side if you ask me but they looked to be fresh.

I got home and dug into my panini. It was definitely tasty but on the smaller flatter side, I wish they stuffed it a little more with ingredients but otherwise it was very delicious and I do recommend that specific sandwich. The cannoli for $2.50 was good as well but not the best I&#39;ve ever had, the custard was on the sweeter side for me. I also didn&#39;t really care for the cookies as they were pure sugar.

Overall, my order was done fast and I would try them again for their paninis if I&#39;m in the area but I wouldn&#39;t say that I was wowed or am dying to go back. The guy taking my order was pleasant so they get a star for that. But please turn down the heat next time since it&#39;s not Italy in the summertime! I had to compare this place to the cafe Bonta in Lincolnshire which I much preferred!"

I could feed their gnocchi to someone with no teeth, then melt in your mouth so fast, and they are stuffed with spinach and cheese.

I rarely bring my lunch to work so I&#39;m always looking for good places to eat around my office--this is definitely being added to my list.

It&#39;s a nice cozy place that thankfully lacked all the cheesy things of some Italian restaurants. I was there today just a little after 12 PM, and there was one patron quietly eating lunch and reading a newspaper. I asked the server/cashier what he would suggest since I was new. He helpfully suggested three options that were his favorites. I chose the Venice Tuna Panini and ordered it to go.

As it was being prepared, I sat down at a table to wait and began to regret that I didn&#39;t order it for there. As the server interacted with two other small groups, I could tell that Dolce is a place where people become regulars. The server already knew what the one group wanted without them even ordering!

The food was good and I have a list of things I want to try, but the service on top of it rocketed it up to a full 5 stars...though honestly, it probalby would have been 5 regardless."

Now I&#39;ve found a perfect restaurant for that and other outstanding traditional Italian fare. 

Dolce is a vest-pocket restaurant with slightly more than a few tables.  It has the traditional red checkered table cloth and the rarely found great traditional Italian food.

We chatted with our very affable server who explained that the restaurant was a family restaurant.  They&#39;ve been in operation for a few years with business building by word of mouth.  His father is the chef and owner.  He is one of the servers.  Father-son! 

Before our entrée, a choice of soup or salad was offered.  My choice of soup, minestrone, was a cup of true Italian character.

The meat lasagna I ordered had al dente noodles with a delicious meat filling.  The sauce was the perfect combination of slight sweetness and slight bitter with intermediate thickness.

My partner had a gluten free pasta.  Gluten free can have its issues in terms of noodles, just not holding up well.  Not so here.  Al dente noodles.  The dish was great, shrimp and broccoli chosen as ingredients to be added.

Toasted garlic rolls are served with the meal.  Bravo!

This gem of a restaurant offers specials.  It also has baked goods which looked great but not tasted this time.

And there is yet more possibly in store.  Son advises they have a good pizza dough recipe.  However, father is the sole cook and pizza takes time and oven space.  They don&#39;t want anything else to suffer.  Planning ahead but wanting to keep their fine quality--another mark of a superior restaurant. 

The pricing is very reasonable and make note: it&#39;s BYOB.  They take reservations.  

Bravo Father/Son!"

I had the Palermo Fig Sandwich which was perfect. The flavor was a nice blend of prosciutto, agrula, fig and balsamic on a ciabatta. I could have had 2 of these things! Finished it off with a mini cannoli. Just excellent. Great friendly service and a good price as well, especially since they give you a salad with the sandwich. Ahh, I wish this place was in Indy where I live. I would eat here so much."

First of all it smells delish inside, and second, they have those adorable red and white check table cloths.

The menu has a little bit of italian joy for everyone, including gluten free meals. The cookies on the display case are really adorable and inviting, I had to fight a strong urge to get a dozen.

Their sandwiches menu is varied and sure to please. They also have italian sodas and coffee beverages.

I ordered take out and they prepared my order fresh and from scratch while I waited.

I got a minestrone, spaghetti with marinara and meatballs on the size, with a caprese salad.

Everything was lovely, and I really like their tomato sauce.

I&#39;ll be back soon!"

Maybe a mile away.  NEVER knew it existed til I got a Restaurant.com coupon.  And WOW WOW WOW!  The food is EXCELLENT, and just as important, the staff is SO friendly and sweet!  Service is great!  Everything is good here from the appetizers through the desserts.  And, there&#39;s enough food on your plate to actually fill you up.  (You know what I mean.  Those restaurants that make your meal SO tiny that you get a couple of bites or tastes of things and pay a fortune!)  Not here, you get real portions and REAL flavor.  You&#39;ll believe me when you try the Bruschetta  and their garlic dinner rolls!  
It&#39;s in the corner of a strip mall...and nothing fancy to look at.  There are only a few tables, and I would recommend calling for a reservation if you&#39;re going on a weekend during peak dining hours...just to make sure.

It&#39;s tucked away in the corner of Lake Cook Rd and Arlington Heights. Dolce Italian Caffe is family owned and the owner is one of the sweetest lady I have ever met! She&#39;s clearly passionate about her customers and her business and it shows. 

As for the food, I&#39;ve had their Venice Tuna Panini a few times already and I can&#39;t even begin to describe its deliciousness... but it&#39;s definitely a must try! I&#39;ve also had their Prosciutto panini and it&#39;s good too, but nothing beats the tuna.

I have a hard time getting the hubs to go get Italian and yesterday when it was pouring and we didn&#39;t want to go out we ordered from this little place around the corner from our place and we were not disappointed. He got the chicken vesuvio and he liked it and he is very hard to please when it comes to food.  I had the chicken farm and it was really good even the leftovers I heated up today were still good. They give garlic rolls with the meals which after I took off all the garlic were really good.  Not a huge fan of garlic on the top of the rolls but I am sure I could ask for it without next time.  The only reason I didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars was I wasn&#39;t impressed with the soups. I got one beef barley and one minestrone. The beef barley was ok but the minestone was the biggest down fall for me it was more like a cabbage soup with carrots and celery.  Not at all like the minestrone that I am used to. But we will definitely be back.

You can call ahead, order to go or eat in. My mom and I chose to eat in. Quick service and blown away by all of the menu options from appetizers like fried calamari, sandwiches (who doesn&#39;t crave an awesome meatball Sammy?) Panini&#39;s and pasta dishes. 
For lunch I chose the Tuna Panini which had a great taste, made with olive oil, sundried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. Delish. My mom had an Italian with salami, prosciutto and provolone. We started with minestrone for mom and cream of spinach for me. Both were full of flavor and not your typical made ahead of time soups. The cream of spinach was light and creamy, I could have eaten a bigger bowl with a big hunk of bread!
To go we grabbed some Almond Crescent cookies which were just sweet enough to satisfy a craving.

The owner was very helpful when I asked her what most people ordered for a chicken dish. I opted for the Chicken Pesto Panini. I also got broccoli soup. For desert a mini canola. I didn&#39;t expect much, since most Panini&#39;s I&#39;ve have are very greasy. But not this one. It had just the right amount of everything. The bread was grilled but not greasy. It was delicious. I also didn&#39;t expect much out of soup (my favorite). Wrong again! Some of the best I&#39;ve had. I might have made it a little thicker, but the taste was wonderful. And the cannoli (another thing I never order) was out of this world. It wasn&#39;t your typical cannoli . It was fresh and crisp and I don&#39;t think they used ricotta. My guess is they used Mascarpone cheese. Yummy!

We both had an Frittata with Roasted Red Peppers, Feta Cheese, Kalamata Olives and caramelized onions, and asked that they add in some Italian Sausage, which completed the dish, we both loved it. The inside of the cafe feels like an nice little neighborhood bakery in Italy, with family photos adorning the walls. Really felt like home, and did I mention the cookies? 

One amazing item we have never seen was a giant Cannoli cake which looked amazing. The place is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and if you are looking to cater a party, this is the place to call! All this and BYOB as well!

What more can you ask for.  For an appetizer, we had the antipasto platter, which was delicious. The homemade warm rolls that came were wonderful and tasty.  We also had cups of pasta fagiole, loved it.  I had a special of chicken parm with linguine alfredo.  Very very good.  My son had chicken marsala, and also a side of meatballs.  Nice size servings.  Everything was very good.  But by the end, we were full (with some to take home), and could not try any dessert.  Next time.  Everything was great, at very good prices.  We definitely will be back."

And we were duly rewarded with a charming little room, which looks like self-serve, but is not. The menu is a Libra nightmare with too many great and flavorful choices of panini, subs, traditional Italian pasta and other entrees. For example, three kinds of lasagna, meat, eggplant or veggie. $8.95 at lunch. $10.95 at dinner. Accompanied by fresh soup or salad. In fact, most lunch choices regardless of type vary in price from $7.95 - 10.95. We went with the sandwich options: The Milano panino, morsels of fresh grilled chicken, with house-made pesto, mozzarella and the brilliant addition of arugula. It was one of the best sandwiches I&#39;ve had in awhile. Sister Betty had the Italian Beef, served with a side of au jus. I didn&#39;t taste it, but she raved about the flavor and tenderness of the beef. Which by the way, is also made on site. The food, along with gracious and unpretentious service you&#39;d expect from a family deli made for a memorable mid-week lunch experience."

We ordered this wonderful fresh baked garlic spinach bread, and a breaded potato &#34;hush-puppy&#34; that was just tasty  to start, then we had the minestrone soup (came as an entree choice with the dinner menu), that was delightful.

It is simply one of my favorite Italian places anywhere. Their minestrone is hearty and loaded with vegetables, I&#39;ve never had a salad that was less than delicious, their sandwiches are huge and come with the most incredible hand cut french fries money can buy, and their pasta dishes feature great meat, tasty sauces, and perfectly cooked pasta. I have never been disappointed in anything I&#39;ve ordered in the dozen times I&#39;ve gone. I would recommend a particular dish, but I change it up almost every time. The service has always been very friendly and prompt, but never rushed. The restaurant is also BYOB in case you feel like having a bottle of wine with dinner. The setup is simple and intimate, with a bunch of square tables with simple decorations. You will be pleasantly surprised that a corner store in a strip typical looking strip mall can have such great food. Give this place a try and you&#39;ll probably be back."

Torre &amp; Lukes gives you TWICE the amount and fabulous flavour.  When I went up to her she said she would box it, she didn&#39;t contain the &#34;au jus&#34; which my husband might have wanted - which I found out after I got home.  Ok, and then the cherry on the cake:  the owner asked how I liked it and I quietly told her - it was quite salty, and instead of apologizing or offering something - like even a homemade cookie for &#34;goodwill&#34; - she said - &#34;OH, you&#39;re the first person to say that&#34;.  Really?  In today&#39;s economy?  good luck!  Sorry Methinks NOT!!

From the outside its easy to miss it, the location is in a little strip mall with nothing else really or note around it but it&#39;s worth stopping in and trying it out.

Do not walk in any later than 20 minutes prior or they will refuse to make anything. Even if you come in at 1:30 and try to order an extra plate of sushi in the middle of your meal, they will refuse. This signifies laziness in the kitchen staff and an unwillingness to please the customer. They refused to put noodles on a dish for a child, even when we offered to pay extra.

What I got was a fair level of disappointment.  I ordered the Philadelphia Roll, which was a clumsy mess of low quality salmon and cream cheese, without real consideration for proportion.  The 911 roll showed more promise, but again it just failed to deliver any real finesse.

Sushi should be a thoughtful experience where chefs understand their ingredients and dare the guest to experience excitement in each bite because each element is so exposed.  This, this is what I&#39;d expect to eat after sweating out a 12-hour day in a warehouse.  A Burger King level of two stars for a Burger King quality experience."

We would literally come here once a week to get my favorite dish their tonkatsu curry!! As an Asian that has tried tonkatsu curry at every Japanese restaurant that offers tonkatsu curry, it is by far the best tonkatsu curry I have had in the US. It is super hearty and warming to the soul. Their curry is perfectly flavored with nicely sized chunks of carrots, onion, and beef. The tonkatsu is only 1 deep fried pork cutlet, which may be the only downside because it is so crispy and complements the curry so well. Beneath the tonkatsu and curry is a bed of rice that is well-portioned. 
Their miso soup and house salad are also excellent. The Japanese salad dressing they use is so GOOD! My husband loves futomaki, and the futomaki at Sakura is amazing! Their spicy tuna roll is great and comes with a good amount of tuna. I could go on, and on about all the wonderful dishes they have made for us that we have thoroughly enjoyed (Niku Udon, Menchi Katsu, Zaru Soba, and more!)
As for the service, Sakura is a family-owned restaurant and everyone there is very friendly! The restaurant is located in a non-descript plaza that seems a bit run-down, so try not to be put off by your initial impression. Inside the restaurant is separated into two rooms that you can select to be seated in. One side is where the kitchen, sushi area, and bar is located, this has seating for smaller groups of 2 or 4. This side is where my husband and I usually sit, because it has a more intimate ambiance, and we come during slower hours (8:00-9:00pm on weeknights). The other side is a lot brighter and can accommodate bigger groups, on weeknights you will see a lot of Japanese businessmen gathering in this room eating and drinking pitchers of Sapporo. That&#39;s how you know this place is good. The other side also has a great jazz band that plays on some weekends! If you are looking for an authentic taste of Japanese cuisine, Sakura is the place."

Girlfriend&#39;s order arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. 30 minutes after she finished her food, I approached our waitress to ask if my order had been misplaced. She hadn&#39;t visited our table since taking our orders 40 minutes ago. She apologized and said it would be right out. I saw the chefs make two more orders before even starting mine. If I hadn&#39;t approached the waitress(if I can call her that), I don&#39;t even know how long it would have taken.

They weren&#39;t even busy."

I had been there several times before and never had an extreme experience as the last one, but this one server, not sure if she&#39;s the owner, made the visit so unpleasant I will not go back to this place again.
The old Japanese lady spoke in a very rude manner.  We saw only shrimp tempura in Tempura Udon and asked if it should come with other vegetable tempura as well.  She angrily responded, &#34; No!  That&#39;s Korean style!  This is Japanese style!&#34;  First of all, I did not understand why she was rude in her response.  Second, what does Korean and Japanese style have to do with answering whether or not vegetable tempura should be included in Tempura Udon?  I had suspected that she may be discriminating due to my nationality, but thought perhaps she&#39;s just having a bad day or she&#39;s a grumpy person and that&#39;s how she speaks.  Shortly after, a Japanese family was seated next to our table, and the server&#39;s demeanor changed like a night and day!  She smiled at them, checked on them, and conversed with them asking where they are from and so forth.  The server spoke rudely to us with a straight face, never checked on us and we had to wait and ask for her in order to get the check.  Obviously, she is only one person and cannot represent her people, however, she left such a negative impression with her poor, discriminatory demeanor, it really doesn&#39;t help the image of her restaurant nor her people."

And boy, am I glad it was closed! Sakura is definitely one of my favorite Japanese spots in the Chicagoland area.

Having lived in Japan for 6 months, finding authentic, quality Japanese food can be difficult--so many watered down, Americanized versions out there. Sakura, though, is not one of them. It&#39;s true, Japanese home cookin&#39;. The saba shioyaki is excellent &amp; perfectly seasoned. The sushi tastes fresh, though maybe a tiny bit pricey for the amount. The udon is a good, solid udon, as is their miso soup. I often gauge Japanese restaurants by their miso soup; it&#39;s so simple, and yet at some places it tastes more like salt water. I figure, if restaurants take the time to make a good miso, they probably put in a strong effort into the rest of their food as well.

The service is friendly, and the vibe hospitable. The room is a little on the warm side, especially near the kitchen, but it&#39;s nothing unbearable. If you&#39;re looking for good, authentic Japanese cuisine, Sakura is it."

Appearances can be deceiving, however, as inside features some nice maki choices and a pleasant enough atmosphere.  On the night I went (a Friday), they had a live soft jazz band playing.

Upon entering Sakura you&#39;ll likely be greeted enthusiastically by one of their sushi masters.  Chef Morimoto (no idea what his name actually was) seemed genuinely happy to have our business.  Our server was much less spirited--in fact, she was pretty meek and spoke almost too softly to understand.  What was more of a problem was when I asked about the specials, I received a blank look and no response.

Me: &#34;You know, the daily specials....I think the sign outside said softshell crab?&#34;
Her: &#34;Sure, crab, yes, mhmm.&#34;
Me: &#34;Uh, okay then.....&#34;

So I got two orders of nigiri sushi which was adeptly prepared by said friendly sushi guru.  As he handed it off to my hungry eyes, I politely nodded my head and said in my best Uma-Thurman-in-Kill-Bill voice, &#39;arigato&#39;.  He smiled, appreciating that the whitest dude ever (me) at least made a bilingual effort to thank him for being a master at his craft.

Sakura is one of the few places I&#39;ve been to (can count them on one hand) that has Sapporo beer on draft.  SCHWING!  When it came time to ring up the tab, I received no itemized receipt, as I would get at literally any other restaurant on the planet.  Instead, I just got the final amount and had to request a play-by-play tab so I knew how much my Sapporos were (they were $6 each).  The check total was a bit more than I expected, but you can&#39;t really put a price on carefully prepared sushi.  Or can you.....?


TL;DR: 4 stars for sushi quality, 3 stars for value, 2 for service--average 3 stars.  Plus 1/2 a star for having draft Sapporo, and in rounding up/down Sakura gets the benefit of the doubt.  There&#39;s dozens of other places I&#39;ve been where the sushi maki is the same quality in a greater quantity at half the price."

It&#39;s not a real holiday and I know nobody who isn&#39;t a community manager even cares (though I did get one shout out- thanks, Christian K!), but for whatever reason I felt like celebrating this made up day by treating myself to a solo sushi dinner at a local independent business.

I&#39;d been wanting to check out Sakura ever since I stumbled upon Yanyao N&#39;s review, because, ya know, her word is as good as gold in my household. No joke. If I say I found a place I really want to visit, the peanut gallery at the G household happily ignores me. But if I say Yanyao went somewhere and loves it, well, all of a sudden we&#39;re running out the door to get there. 

So anyway, I head on in to a semi empty Sakura and get to pick my seat from the 2-tops in the first sectioned off room area. I had my pick of seats at the sushi bar but personally, when I go out to eat alone, I like to eat alone as well and not put myself in any kind of position where I might have to talk to people who aren&#39;t directly affiliated with restaurant. 

My server was soft spoken and sweet and brought the miso soup I ordered out in exactly the blink of an eye. The general vibe of the service on a Monday night wasn&#39;t overly attentive or friendly, but I&#39;ve waited tables before and the absolute worst is when it&#39;s slow and you get stuck waiting on a single person, trying to decipher whether they&#39;re just sitting there looking all all blank because they need something or because they just enjoy the silence. So I guess for my being a single diner who was just in it to enjoy the silence, the service was pretty spot on and my green tea was always full and hot. 

The broth in my miso was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had- so much so that I was tempted to follow up my appetizer miso soup with a second serving of miso soup. For sushi, I went with my standard spicy tuna, which was fine, but I tried it after having started with the 911 roll (tuna, jalapeno, double wasabi, and spicy sauce) that was by far and away, the spiciest tuna roll I have ever had--and I always seek out the spiciest thing on the menu and 100% of the time I&#39;m disappointment with the lack of spice... but not this time. It was perfect. Perfect and spicy enough that I had to take a break and chow down of the lobster salad to cool my mouth off, so I could even attempt to taste the spicy tuna roll. LOVE. 

They didn&#39;t have a ton of sushi options, but they have other dishes beyond sushi like noodles, tons of appetizers, salads etc. The atmosphere isn&#39;t fancy, there isn&#39;t much ambiance, but you probably weren&#39;t expecting the Ritz if you paid any attention at all while pulling up to this somewhat dilapidated parking lot and outdated suburban strip mall.

When I went to leave my server stopped everything she was doing to thank me for coming in and I turned the corner to the exiting path past the sushi bar, all the elder sushi chefs stopped what they were doing and took the time to thank me for coming in and trying their food. Then, as I walked out the door, my heart, now warmed by the kind gesture of appreciation by the staff, grew three sizes larger when I saw this sign: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TS__uZpyM-kVJ4GwIa7b0g&amp;userid=UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg

It&#39;s got the head chef&#39;s photo on it (from his younger days) and handwritten at the top in silver marker and red, glittery puff paint it reads: Thank you very much. See you tomorrow. Have a nice day. 

And that was it. So much heart in so few, short, simple interactions, yet I felt more appreciated than I have in, well, a really long time. And you know what? I probably will be back tomorrow; Showing my support and appreciation for independent businesses like Sakura that truly appreciate their customers."

I tried the miso soup and agree with the recommendations here. It&#39;s simple but really good. We had a few different maki rolls, all of which were great. The spicy sauce on one of them was creamy and delicious. My girlfriend, who usually doesn&#39;t like spicy things, kept dipping her philly roll in it. The waitress recommended a really good sake, which I&#39;m sure was a lot better than the one we almost got (not knowing much about sake). My one complaint is that the green tea mochi we ordered after our meal was a little freezer burned and frozen as hard as a rock, which made it hard to eat. Not enough to bring my review of this place down from 5 stars. The food and service were that good.

My guy is in Chicago on business frequently, and we often stay out in the Schaumburg area. The food has, without exception, been excellent. But we were treated so poorly on Monday, February 4, that we will not return.

We arrived at the restaurant shortly after 7 p.m. The place was not crowded  and we were told we could sit anywhere. We chose a table near the window. 

After we sat down, ordered our food and had begun enjoying our beverages, a large group of Japanese businessmen came in. The staff began racing around, re-arranging tables to accommodate them. A server (not our server, but the one who presumably would be waiting on this group) said she needed our table for that group and she would like us to move. No &#34;please&#34; or &#34;would you mind...?&#34; No assistance in moving our stuff. No offer of any recompense for our inconvenience. Just get thee out of our way.

I probably could have let it slide, but my companion was furious on two counts. First, that we were asked to move, at all. And second, that there was absolutely no courtesy or respect accorded in any of it. We walked out.

He called the next day to speak to the manager or owner. They weren&#39;t in, so he left a message. He is still waiting for a return phone call.

My first Japanese boss took me here back in 1997 and introduced me to sushi...and ever since then, I have been hooked... both on sushi &amp; on Sakura.

However, the prices have gone up, so for the Sakura Chirashi dish (the one that includes Salmon Roe),  you will be dinged for $25.  But, along with the increase of price, it seems that they have increased the quantity of that dish, so I guess it kind of off-sets itself. (It is now 3 hours after we left, and I still feel stuffed.)  The quality of all the fish that I had today was excellent.  Another member of our lunch party had the Ramen (i know, i know...not Japanese), but he said that it was one of the best Ramen dishes he has ever had, and he had spent some time in Japan. 

Which goes to this point:  An establishment that keeps on producing quality Japanese food year after year, and continues to be a favorite of the local Japanese clients (I work for a Japanese owned company, so I have known plenty of expatriates from Japan who love this place), and can pretty much fill up the place for both lunch and dinner, definitely deserves a 5 star.

The strip mall in which the place is located in looks pretty suspect, but don&#39;t let that scare you off...you will forget all about that when you walk through the doors!"

Top 10 reasons for Sakura lovin&#39;:

1) No-frills, strip mall, ethnic - my absolute favorite!

2) Super enthusiastic service - our server was such a doll! Joking about the size of the portions and commending me for my valiant effort at taking down their bento box. Waters filled, empty plates bussed. Superstar!

3) The lunch menu offerings! I had such a difficult time deciding because this menu reads like Yanyao&#39;s favorite Japanese foods - yakisoba, katsu don, unagi don, ramen, udon, zaru soba, spicy scallop roll, tonkatsu, tempura (and sushi/sashimi/maki rolls too). Plus, they have sukiyaki and and shabu shabu for dinner!

4) Over half of the clientele during our visit was speaking Japanese. 

5) The combination bento box! This is the most absurd bento box I have ever encountered - more like a bento platter. I chose unagi over the beef/chicken/salmon. Out came a giant platter with THREE salads (house, potato, and a cucumber with seaweed and crabstick), rice, a huge piece of unagi, two pieces of fried shrimp (so good, I even ate the tail), and vegetable yakisoba (THE BEST) -- yes, you read that right... rice AND noodles. Everything delicious. Very difficult to finish. FOOD OVERLOAD!

6) The tonkatsu is crispy and delicious - 2 large pieces of pork, served with a house salad, rice and miso soup.

7) House-made gyoza - winner!

8) The speed at which lunch comes out - we were eating within 7 minutes of ordering. This is a terrific lunch spot in the area.

9) The price! An enormous lunch for 2, with green tea, was only $32! 

10) Not having to eat at the gross chain restaurants in Schaumburg? #WINNING"

You can choose to pay less and have just one item from the Mix with your rice and broth: a sheet of nori (seaweed) for $5.95, Ume (pickled plum) for $6.95, Sake (salmon) for $6.95, Tarako (broiled cod roe) for $6.95. Because I don&#39;t like umeboshi (pickled plum), I asked to substitute it with takuan (pickled daikon radish).

Beef Aspara-Maki appetizer for $8.95. It&#39;s sliced beef rolled with asparagus and broiled with teriyaki sauce and a Kiliuea roll for $11.95. It&#39;s the darkest part of the tuna (and the most expensive)

Green tea is a good beverage to have with anything Japanese."

Sakura popped up with a promising rating and good reviews, so off we went.

The chefs at the bar were the first people we saw when we walked in, and they all gave friendly greetings in Japanese, and it wasn&#39;t too long before we were shown to a table. It did take them a few minutes to bring us menus. After that, it was a little rough because we thought we were going to have to wave someone down for a menu. But they eventually brought us menus and hot towels to wipe down our hands, which was a nice touch. 

We&#39;d had the impression that we were going into a sushi place, but truth be told, this place is probably better with its appetizers and entrees. You can generally tell what a place is devoted to by the size of its selection. There was a sushi menu, and a few specials, but it was pretty clear that this place is more devoted to good hot entrees and appetizers. 

Since we&#39;re a little adventurous and pretty flexible, we decided to get a couple of rolls that caught our attention, and we each ordered our own noodle soup. I got the ramen, and my bf got soba. We did share an order of crab shumai and realized that we could probably go to any Asian market and buy a whole bag, but hey, at least we discovered its existence. :)

Our server was pleasant but not pushy, and the food came FAST and hot. I mean...I&#39;m pretty sure we had all of our food under 10 minutes. The sushi portions were typical, and the entree portions were huge. My bf took some of my ramen, and I still couldn&#39;t finish it. 

Sakura is situated in a nondescript strip mall near Woodfield, and I was glad we found it. We generally have defaulted to nearby Mitsuwa for ramen or sushi when we have the craving, and though we have no plans to abandon Mitsuwa, we were pleased to find this little place that offers a variety to meet different Japanese food cravings. We live in the city and won&#39;t make regular trips, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back when we&#39;re in the area."

Sushi was essentially slabs of meat (servers term, not mine) placed on old rice. Get the more expensive meal and more &#34;meat&#34;. Rolls are uninspired - no consideration of competition offerings.

They took our order quickly, the food came swiftly, and we were able to check out (all in our lunch hour). I think the price is pretty comparable to other sushi places around.

The place seemed authentically Japanese.  We saw many Japanese patrons, as well as a lot of Japanese text on the menu.  I wonder if there are some kind of exclusive Japanese-only menu items?

I love good sushi, but hate spending much money.  However, there tends to be difficulty getting one without doing the other.  In this case I did spend more money than I would have liked, which was not totally unexpected, but a lot of other places I&#39;ve been would have at least included a miso soup and/or a house salad for the price.

I&#39;ve had a lot of green tea in my day (including in Japan), and the hot green tea here was surprisingly bland.  Maybe I just burned my taste buds off with that first scalding sip, but it tasted like nothing more than hot water with the subliminal implication of being green tea - which is surprising, with all of the sediment I saw at the bottom.

My husband wanted the tempura mozzarella for an appetizer, which was light, crisp, and tasty, so no complaints there.  It came with four salted green beans (not edamame) and ginger dipping sauce.

The unagi rolls were delicious, as well as the Futo maki we ordered.  As far as the quality of the food goes, we have little to complain about.  It was very tasty, at least as tasty as some of the other good sushi places we&#39;ve eaten.

The low point of our meal was the service.  There are some people who will complain about the service wherever they go because they are just unpleasant individuals.  I am not one of those people.  Usually I am tolerant of even very indifferent service, and while I don&#39;t mean to complain even now, I must say our server made us feel pretty unwelcome.  I don&#39;t know if she was overworked or maybe was just having an off-night, but she pretty much just flew through when bringing us food and the check, and had a demeanor that made my husband say mid-meal &#34;I don&#39;t think she likes me.&#34;  I didn&#39;t take it THAT personally (there was no obvious reason for her to be put off by us), but she definitely made me feel like we were imposing by eating here.  I wouldn&#39;t say it ruined our meal, but it did kind of make us feel like our patronage wasn&#39;t wanted.  The chefs behind the sushi bar, on the other hand, were quite friendly in welcoming us in to the restaurant and wishing us a good night when we departed.

All things considered we may try this place again, but on the other hand there are other equally good places we can go for sushi without feeling discouraged.  I don&#39;t want to sound overly dramatic about our experience because really it was only a case of subtle discomfort, so certainly if you are curious to try this place I would encourage you to do so."
sakura-woodfield-rolling-meadows,Phil S.,asP08n8OwVhIg2hyff8DFQ,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,1,0,133,1025,J1kBbS5yevwoqa600SFrHg,2.0,2012-09-30,"We decided to try this place out after hearing good reviews about the ramen and rolls. I&#39;m not much of a roll fan because a roll is basically just over-riced sushi but I&#39;m enjoy a good bowl of noodles.

It was past peak dinner hours on a Saturday but the place was still bristling with activity.

We started with the Kaki Fry and was pleasantly surprised by the fresh tenderness of the oysters. We tried to order a beef tongue appetizer but it wasn&#39;t available so we ordered a Dynamite Roll instead. The roll was decent as far as rolls go but we noticed it was a little on the salty side and the flavor wasn&#39;t coming from the sauce either. This was a foresight of dishes to come.

Ramen and Yaki Soba were next up on our list and we were pleasantly surprised with presentation. The ramen came in a dark broth topped with a harboiled egg half and various meats. The yaki soba came as a steaming heap of noodles and bountiful meat topped with dry seasonings and the whole dish looked very smokey and dark. Presentation was great but at first bite we both said the same thing: wow this is salty! Serious sodium overload at this place. My first thought about this tragedy is that they must be catering to the typical American tongue. 

What a shame because the noodles were fresh made and they had a great consistency and the other flavors seemed like they would&#39;ve been fantastic as well had the salt not overpowered everything. The yaki was cooked to smokey perfection and had such a great smokey flavor and the ramen noodles themselves were soft and chewy just like a fresh noodle should be but I was constantly reaching for water to calm the salt beast thrashing around in our dishes. I wish they would realize that adding flavor does not mean adding more salt because the flavors had real promise.

Service was a little slow but we had one lonely waitress serving one entire side of the place by herself and she was walking back and forth getting dishes and drinks non-stop. She was polite enough but I could tell she was extremely tired and didn&#39;t even have enough energy for a fake smile. She did her best though and we received everything we needed as long as we requested it. At the rate this woman was working it would&#39;ve been impossible for her to remember all the small details. What&#39;s funny was there was at least eight guys crowded behind the sushi bar and grill area. 

Overall, I was not impressed with this place and left longing for the noodles at Sankyu. It&#39;s too bad that Sankyu has the worst service I&#39;ve ever encountered. I&#39;d probably go back to Sakura again someday but I&#39;m going to have to request they take it easy on the soy sauce if I do go back."

Sushi may seem expensive for those who like to eat non-authentic sushi (like dragon roll and that kind with mayo, etc.) because their sushi is real/authentic Japanese style, and it is very reasonably priced for the quality. Menchi-katsu curry is one of my favorite dishes. Menchi-katsu is a panko covered deep-fried hamburger mixture, a Japanese home-food, and that comes with their home-made curry with rice = yummy!! The restaurant also has early dinner specials if you get there until 6:30 Monday-Thursday, and they are very reasonably priced.  For sushi, my favorite is Sakura sushi, Edo-style authentic sushi.  In my opinion, they serve the best sushi in the NW suburbs.  It&#39;s not a fancy place to wear heals and dresses, but is at-home and very comfortable restaurant."

This is true even in the suburbs of SF, LA, and Seattle, just 50 miles inland. 

So finding good Japanese food in suburban Chicagoland is something you accept as a pipe dream. 

That&#39;s why Sakura was a pleasant surprise! Not only do they have good, authentic Japanese dishes, the president, Sinnai Makoto-san is Japanese, and many of the female wait staff is Japanese. Our server, HIdemi-san, was from Okayama, Hyogo-ken. 

We had a pretty good size group, about 12 of us. The company was good, food was good, the service was good, the Sake was good. Tanoshikatta!

We shared a mix of sushi choices, both Nigiri and more Westernized rolls, Sashimi, and Nabeyaki Udon noodle soup. The fish was fresh and tasty, even the Ikura (Salmon Roe). The Edamame was cold, not  warm, though, but salted nicely. 

You can get a nice Omakase sushi platter for about $30. The other dinner entrees are fairly priced, all between $20 - $25, for things ike Sashimi dinner, Ume Sushi, Ume Chirashi, Sakura Chirashi, all mixtures of good fish slices. They have a good list of appetizers, salads, and cooked dinner entrees like Teriyaki of all types, Negimaki, Unagi Kabayaki, Katsu, and combination Bento boxes. 

If you are in the Schaumburg, Rolling Meadows, Hoffman Estates, and nearby northwest suburbs, this is a good choice. Fortunately, there are some major Japanese Companies with US subsidiaries or US Customers in the general area, so that will help keep this place authentic, with Japanese nationals eating here, and a great choice for real Japanese food."

We had Dynamite and Mexican rolls. The Dynamite rolls were not as flavorful as we&#39;d hoped, but it showcased the fresh fish very well. Our server said the Mexican rolls were a favorite dish among many -- and for good reason! Great flavor with good spice, if you like jalepeno.

Our server also recommended the aspari-maki appetizer. It&#39;s asparigus wrapped in broiled beef with teriyaki sauce, cut into rolls like sushi. I&#39;ve never seen an appetizer like this before, but it was fantastic. I want to try so many more items on the menu, but it&#39;ll be tough to pass this one up.

Our server was very good. He was friendly and gave great recommendations. We were too full to try all of his recommendations, but we&#39;ll be back to try the tempura and squid appetizers (he even came by our table to show us someone else&#39;s squid), along with more sushi.

As other reviewers have noted, we noticed a number of Japanese businessmen eating here. Most of them appeared to be regulars as they were greeted personally by the chefs.

Always a good sign in a sushi house to hear most of the other guests speaking Japanese. I went with the tonkatsu (breaded pork) with veggie sauce and it was excellent.

Their steak teriaki combo plate is great when they don&#39;t overcook the steak.  First time I had it , It was OUTSTANDING. Second time, a little over cooked, so good, but not as great. 

They get 4 stars only because :
1) they are a little pricey. Plan on dropping 50-100 dollars on a dinner for 2.
2) there&#39;s something a little off with the salad dressing.  I love the dressing from benihana, kampai, yu sun, etc.. but here, it&#39;s got a strange flavor.  Not a fan of it.

The food was good but nothing spectacular.  We both had bento boxes that contained tempura, sashimi, rice, a tiny egg roll, some raw tuna with mayonnaise, fish cake, a pot sticker/dumpling,  and other assorted items.  There was a lot of food but the steak teriyaki was overdone and a little too chewy.  The dragon roll was ok, but not great.  The miso soup and salad that came along was good.  However, the price $90 for 2 people including tax and tip was too pricey for the quality of food."

I bought carry-out a few months ago. My salad was packaged before me (the restaurant worker used an ungloved hand throwing a handful of lettuce into a container). I noted he handled other items before this and hadn&#39;t washed his hands.  I ordered a few rolls and would be generous to describe them as average. In truth, they were insipid. One of the rolls was a California roll with a minuscule fake crab center. After reluctantly finishing my lunch my stomach was unsettled. Maybe the unwashed hands, or possibly just the thought of it?"

The fish is terrifically fresh on a friday night. I had the sashimi dinner and each piece tasted buttery smooth.

My girlfriend had a dynamite roll and a spider roll. the Dynamite role was good, with Tuna and Yellowtail rolled up, but we could have done without the sauce that topped each piece. The soft shell crab in the spider roll was over-cooked. It tasted ok, but we&#39;ve had better.

I would recommend this place. It&#39;s not very crowded, and the service was great. Our waiter was very friendly, as were the sushi-chefs and other waitresses in the place."

Upfront, yes, the place is not pretty to look at. It has an 80s feel to it for some reason. That weirdness aside, this place was really good.

The wait staff was really friendly, the gyoza and the rolls were super tasty. I did not try any nigiri or sashimi, as it was just a lunch run. Philly roll was amazing ... a simple roll that a lot of place find a way to mess up. Also, a wicked tobiko roll (the Sakura roll) ... six pieces topped with 3 types of tobiko beautifully placed on some super spicy sauce.

One thing I am super picky about is the texture of my rice, be it in rolls or nigiri. I could feel every grain of rice in my mouth. It was wonderful!

Heading there for lunch again. Sakura is a nice little sushi gem to keep in my back pocket."

The inside isnt a luxury decor either, but the food is damn good.  When a place is full of the same ethnic as type of restaurant it is.  In most cases, you know that you are going to eat some decent food.  Been going here for a couple of years and the food quality and the freshness is never off!  On top of it I always see the same sushi chefs working.  I have tried the sushi and the noodle dishes.  Lets start off w/ their bread and butter, ok let me reiterate that their soy sauce and wasabi....Sushi never failed me here yet, along w/ the out of towners that I bring.  Rainbow is always a must and so are the rest when I go (911, spicy tuna, spider, and dynamite)  I would only advise that you be drinking some of their excellent sake.  If you would go Felipe style it would be sake bombs, for the rookies out there its sapporro and a sake shot.  ;)  Well w/ any of those rolls you cant go wrong, as well as the noodle dishes.  Yakisoba is always a winner if you are not a fish eater.  Its not the prettiest duckling inside or out, but who cares the food rocks here!"

Low key, nice staff and super hot tea to start off with.

Then the spicy tuna was definitely impressive.  I got some salmon sashimi as my comparative fish, and it was pretty good.  I&#39;m kind of a sushi snob, but the fish I did have here was pretty fresh and well prepared.  Portions are nice and we both drank and ate quite a bit and got out of there very reasonably ($50!).

So this Friday night we decided to change that. It&#39;s a traditional Italian restaurant which I really enjoy occasionally. We had a reservation for 7:30 and were seated right away. The service was good, attentive and quick but not fabulous. It was what you&#39;d expect at this price point which is reasonable. I had the chicken parm, (See traditional). It was a little heavy on the cheese but otherwise very good.
She had the chicken vesuvio I think it was and she really enjoyed it. 
The wine list is just ok. We ended up with a John and Tony&#39;s blend which was a cab and merlot and it was pretty good for a $31 carafe. 
Atmosphere is nicely appointed, clean, actually nicer than I had expected. 
After dinner we made our way over to the bar and they had some live music, a couple that was playing some soft rock. They also have TV&#39;s all over the bar area so you could watch the Hawks game. (they won). All in all we had a very nice time and will probably go back again for a nice dinner and some music on a weekend night."

I should have known since there were no other customers having lunch there at 1:00 lunchtime, it was empty in there.. and the ladies bathroom was dirty ..... food wise even worse, ribs are dry and over cooked shrimp and chicken carbonara was sticky and dry eggplant parmesan was very mushy... the lettuce in our salads was old and brown...when we asked to talk to owner John...he was extremely aggressive and rude when we had complaints about our meals.  He also had us wait 45 minutes to talk to him, telling us he had things to do!!  He told us he didn&#39;t believe us that our food was not good telling us his food is great when I showed him the pasta noodles that were all stuck together and glue like a ball he said he&#39;d replace the food we declined bc all our meals were bad...thats when he became aggressive and said pay ur bill and don&#39;t come back...as we were leaving after paying for our terrible meals he became aggressive again bc I took a picture of this terrible experience and in a threatening way he approached me a 59 year old woman with my 2 elderly parents in there 80s and told us he would have the police come and trespass us if we dont leave immediately I thought he was going to hit me.... a women that worked there tried to calm him down and said to us just leave...this is incredibly worrisome that an owner would threaten patrons like John did...I wish the police would have come....we left out of fear...Don&#39;t ever go there!!!"

Never mind the fact that we were drinking alcohol and they could of easily made another $30-$40 on our table just by asking if we wanted a second cocktail. One of us got the linguine di mare, there were so many fractured shells in the pasta he actually stopped eating. The rest of the food was mediocre at best. The owner obviously doesn&#39;t care that the food and service sucks since he sat at a table with guests and drank (at least someone was drinking) and talked loudly for the rest of the bar to hear. Our waitress came by to take the order, dropped off food and disappeared. We literally had to flag her down just to get the bill after our table had been cleared of plates for over 20 minutes. She never asked how to food was, she asked us if we wanted desert as she was brining us our bill. We would of been better off at a diner than this place."

This went on for way too long.  Finally, one Friday night when he decided we should try to find something different, we wandered in.  

We were under-dressed.  I should have known better, but the hostess and waitress were kind and welcoming just the same.  There was no wait at seven on a Friday which concerned me, but it turns out that I think John &amp; Tony&#39;s just aren&#39;t getting the publicity that they deserve.

The bread is not worth the space in your stomach.  I am confused why so many people, including our sweet waitress, thinks that it is so good.  It is overdone and they are stingy with the olive oil and cheese.  This was the only less than complimentary thing that I thought about our entire visit.

We both had soup.  The French Onion was marvelous!  Not too greasy with a nice, rich broth.  My other half tried the soup of the day...cream of broccoli maybe...and was pleased.

He had the fish and ships for dinner.  It is not all you can eat, but the portion was plentiful and he had plenty of leftovers for our 14 year old eating machine at home!

I had a trio.  I&#39;ll be honest here.  I struggled with what to order.  So many things sounded good and that&#39;s why I ended up with a platter of things to try instead of one entree with one side.  When it arrived, I thought I made a mistake in ordering it because it didn&#39;t look like a lot of food and I thought I was going to be hungry.  I was not.  I ate most of it and I was nice and satisfied.  From left to right:  A fried tilapia filet with asparagus, a filet mignon over smashed potatoes with a perfect beef gravy and a chicken breast over sweet potato mash with a slightly spicy sauce.  It was all delicious and served at the right temperatures.  Thank goodness!  That&#39;s a pet peeve of mine and everything was timed just right.  

Prompt service, quality ingredients and reasonably priced sandwich options are the main reasons that I plan on heading back very soon.  You should too...and take a friend because I&#39;d like to see the good word spread about this local gem."

Sure enough it was around 11am [the time they open sunday] and the parking lot was packed, but no one was going in.  We had no idea we would be the first in the doors.

When you walk in, there are 2 eating areas.  The bar to the left and the main dining room to the right.  They had a party that morning in the dining room area, so we were escorted to a highboy table in the bar.  We were told it was a mimosa brunch for $12 a person.  whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!? bring it on!  The potatoes were seasoned with some kind of great salt mixture, the corn beef hash was home made, the eggs Benedict were over cooked but hey, no one is perfect.  They had scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, salads, ribs, made to order omelets, crepes, and a waffle station.  This place was packed in 20 minutes with wall to wall people.  The owner [or manager?] walked around and greeted everyone asking them what they needed, could he get them anything, SUCH good service [we never see that any more] and the hostess was as sweet as could be.

It was good!  We shared the stuffed jalepeno peppers, buffalo shrimp, and the filet mignon skewers.  I found them all to be quite tasty.

The shrimp were butterflied and served on top of a &#34;bed&#34; of blue cheese.  The jalepenos were interesting - halves that were roasted with a mixture of sausage and cheese inside.  Some were quite spicy and some weren&#39;t - guess it depends on the pepper.

The filet skewers were cooked to order (medium rare) and were good as well.  I thought the portions were pretty generous for the price, and the service was attentive and kind.  We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very friendly and conversational.

The service was subpar, the check was wrong as they charged one of the kids as an adult and oddly could not figure out how to clear the check for the longest time. We had no waters brought to us until we had to ask for the waters and the &#34;free mimosas&#34; were very small and were never, ever, offered to be refilled, coffee or sodas or anything.

The food layout was chaotic, it was spread out everywhere with no honest direction, it was like bland bar food, with the price point of a Easter brunch. The ham was very salty and most of the food actually was just lukewarm or even cold. 

Two of the silverware sets were super dirty and we had to make due by grabbing our own. The whole place had a vibe of being not really clean during this event if I am to be even more honest. Nothing about the place spoke about have a special once a year event. N.O.T.H.I.N.G

I would rate this place slighty better than a banquet hall but that would be pushing it.

We arrived shortly before 3:00 p.m. and were told we could choose from the lunch menu if we ordered before 3:00 p.m., or else from the dinner menu.  We wanted to unwind with a drink or two, so selected the dinner menu.  We sat in a booth in the bar area.  We had a wonderful server.  The place was empty, so she was the server, bartender and hostess.  Nevertheless, service was great.

When we looked at the menu, we were surprised at the prices.  $10.95 for a hamburger, $11.95 for a cheeseburger.  So we opted for the pasta dishes, where we get soup or salad with the meal.  I had J &amp; T&#39;s Rigatoni with a salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Both were very good.  My partner had the Linguine with Clams and the Broccoli Cheese Soup--again both were very good.

We both loved the Artisan style bread.  We had it with butter so can&#39;t comment on the olive oil and Parmesan cheese.

Portion sizes were very good.  My partner ate all his food, but I wasn&#39;t able to finish mine.

So why 3 stars rather than 4 or 5?  First, we thought it was overpriced.  Secondly, when I looked at their website, I noticed they have a &#34;Happy Hour&#34; menu, which we were never offered.  According to their website, a Pub burger and fries is $4.95 between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.  My partner would have enjoyed the wings (6 for $2.95).  Maybe the Happy Hour menu is no longer available?  If so, they need to change their website accordingly.

Also, when I looked at the wine list menu, I ordered White Zinfandel, which said $15.00 for a carafe.  I received 1/2 carafe for $15.00.  Their on-line menu shows White Zinfandel at $15.00 per bottle, which is equal to approx. 3/4 carafe.

I know it&#39;s difficult to keep websites up to date, my partner and I are remiss in keeping ours up to date.  However, we don&#39;t post prices or &#34;specials&#34;.

The bread was mediocre, the olive oil was very thin and tasteless (cheap)

We rented out the back room for a family event and for a steak house I have to say it felt very middle of the road.  I&#39;d compare it to Outback, nothing above that type of place, which was disappointing.

I ended up ordering a steak salad and I was very clear that I wanted it medium rare.  This being a steakhouse I figured they knew what I meant.....Woe is me, my steak arrives and it&#39;s grey.

I&#39;m of the opinion that anyone working in a kitchen and 90% of home cooks should be able to cook meat properly.  It&#39;s really not complicated, you can tell by touch and if you advertise as a steakhouse it should be a lay up.  To be honest I usually order Medium Rare because I think they&#39;ll screw up and I&#39;ll end up with Medium or...worst case Medium Well.  The rest of the salad was very underwhelming.  I am reminded of a bag salad from the grocery store with a few strips of flank steak sliced on top.

They also seem to be over the top with sauces for your steak.  Personally this seems more of the french style of mediocre meat and drown it in a peppercorn or hollandaise to mask the sub par meat, but that&#39;s just my .02, I prefer the taste of aged and well prepared beef over sauces.

After we were all done they presented us with a bill that was just a number.  It looked like a computer print out and had NOTHING on it but the $$.  I found the manager and said, &#34;What am I looking at here?&#34;

She replies, &#34;the bill.&#34;

&#34;How do I have any idea if this is our party or not?&#34;  I say.

&#34;Oh, you want an itemized one?&#34;  She inquires.

&#34;yes, thanks that&#39;d be great....&#34;  I reply.

So they add in gratuity, which I understand but don&#39;t give me an itemized copy or our bill?  This is the first time I&#39;ve ever had to ask for an itemized receipt and a restaurant.

I would not return.  It was overpriced and they overcooked all of the meat."

The hostess was very welcoming, however the manager had a different attitude.  We decided not to stay and eat solely on this factor.  She was standing at the front when we walked in and instantly she gave us an unpleasant vibe of the entire place.

The bread for the table was less then mediocre and we only received about 5 tiny slices. I think they could beef that up a bit by picking a more quality bread like LaBriola or something.

We started with the baked goat cheese and it was absolutely delicious! My fiance loved it so much that he wouldn&#39;t let him take it because he wanted to dunk his steak in it - and he did. 

One perk of this place (when you have a hungry guy like I do) is that they give you a lot for the price. Our meals came with soup or salad.... My fiance&#39;s salad was nothing spectacular - just your below average iceberg lettuce with a few veggies and French dressing. I got the French Onion soup which may have been one of the worst I&#39;ve ever had, unfortunately. It was over salted and the broth didn&#39;t have that great, rich, beefy flavor. They didn&#39;t top it with gruyere but with swiss instead - maybe to cut costs? Anyway, it was also evident that after putting the cheese on top, they didn&#39;t bake the soup in the oven but instead fired it with a torch. 

For our entrees, I had the tournedos of filet mignon and it was yummy. A bit over salted also, but tolerable. They were cooked perfectly and the mushroom sauce was rich and had a nice flavor. For my side I got the au gratin potatoes - HUGE MISTAKE. Not good at all. I took a few bites and never returned. It was almost worse then a Betty Crocker box mix. 

My fiance ordered the NY Strip and loved it. His was also cooked perfectly and had nice grill marks on the top. His steak came with a small cup of melted garlic &amp; herb butter to pour on top which was really delicious. For a side he got the sweet potato mash and which was pretty good."

But I&#39;ve slowly exhausted all my other limited food options by my place, so my wife and I decided to venture in.
I liked the decor, it was a nice atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and we got our water and bread pretty quickly.  They poured us some olive oil + pepper + parmesan cheese to dip it with.  
There was some music goin on by the bar, but we were seated in the main area.  It wasn&#39;t too bad, and it seemed like people were having fun.
I ordered the chef trio or something like that.  It was some filet mignon, some chicken, and some fish.  I can&#39;t remember the fish lol.  I think it was tilapia.  Either way, it was yums.
My wife got the special pasta which was a beef ravioli.  That thing was huge.  She probably only dented like 1/3 of it and we took the rest home.
We ended up taking a dessert sampler, of chocolate cake, carrot cake, and choco mousse but to go, cause we were stuffed.
I felt like the portions were good and the prices were reasonable.  I&#39;ll definitely be back to try more of the menu, and we migth check out their brunch one of these days."

Fettuccine Alfredo was very sauce heavy but good, Penne Bolognese was as well.  The Lasagna wasn&#39;t that good. 

Waitress was very pleasant, joking with us, talking and in general just being a very nice person.  Not to mention she was always ready with a refill. 

Great place."

We had noticed about a year or more ago, it changed hands and WE STILL WANTED TO CHECK IT OUT.   fast forward to last night...we wanted to pop in there for a drink, just to check it out. 
What a beautiful place.  Kinda classy, with just a hint of rustic.  And then we sat at the bar...I FOUND MY FAVORITE BARTENDER from my area right here @ John &amp; Tony&#39;s.  I couldnt have been happier to see Michelle.  We lost contact over a year ago.  Whoooo Hoooooo.  You rock Michelle. 
anyway, the aroma coming from the kitchen could entice anyone to try something from the menu, however, we were not prepared to have dinner there, we went with the intention just to see it and have a drink which is what we did. 
Im giving it 5 stars because im so happy to find Michelle and I trust her when she says THERE ISNT A BAD THING ON THE MENU. 

Then we meet John, and he said we should go there today (Sunday) for their $12.99 brunch.  I think we will.  Cant wait to go back for dinner because i have my eyeballs on those parm crusted pork chops.  Yeahhhh babbbbyyyy..

I know they have other specials.  When I go back, I will find out and post them."

Atmosphere terrible.  We had an early dinner, three groups of customers in the dining room.  One group of six were extremely loud.  Either they had a hearing problem or they wanted everyone in the restaurant to know what they were talking about.  Management elected to ignore it, and we have elected to ignore the restaurant in the future."

The food was on the expensive side, but it was very good.  The cocktails are a little different (they each have song title names which don&#39;t pertain much to the flavor of the drink), and I thought they were nothing special.

The entertainment in the bar area is certainly a nice touch.  I was there on a Friday night when the owners (John and Tony) were playing with their band.  They started a bit late, and the mix was up much too loud on the notably talented vocalist, but the cover songs they did were mellow and inviting.

I&#39;d definitely come here again, but perhaps not sit in the bar area.  The music would probably be easier to enjoy from the other end of the restaurant where it wouldn&#39;t be as loud."

The food was very nicely displayed and was easy to access.  Overall, the food was good, but a few items were a greatly under seasoned - potatoes, tomato and mozarella salad.  The meat at the carving station was all perfectly prepared and the omelets were great.  We really liked the desserts and the fact they were cut into small portions.  Very wise move.

Now the negatives.  While we were seated fairly quickly, they really crammed too many tables and chairs into the room.  Our chairs were so close together that we could barely raise our arms to eat.  It took a while for our waitress to fill water glasses and she never even took our drink orders.  She also failed to mention that the one sole coffee carafe was at the far end of the table.  I think it was just really busy for her, but it provided a negative first impression. 

The thing that left us with a very bad taste in our mouth was at the end of our meal.  Our waitress came over and said that her manager told her that we needed to leave because the next party was here for their reservation and they had the same table.  We thought that was extremely rude, especially since the other 2 tables in the room were open.  We understand that it was crowded due to it being Mother&#39;s Day, but honestly couldn&#39;t the manager have said something directly to us instead of sending the poor waitress.  Or could they possibly have phrased it more politely.  Very unprofessional."

It seemed there was only one waitress and one busboy for the whole bar, and during trivia night when a bunch of people were there, this was a mistake. Our waitress forgot to put in our appetizer, barely came around to check on us, and our food took forever to get to us. She was polite and very friendly, but not attentive. And we were among the first there, so it&#39;s not like she was juggling when we ordered our appetizer and entrees, so maybe she was just a little scattered? But as soon as it got busy, all hope was definitely lost in getting her attention for anything.

Took a family member last Saturday evening what a disapointment! The calamari was good the prime rib was awful no meat, all fat ordered it medium rare it was raw, sent it back the manager said they couldnt replace it because it was all that way. My thoughts if you have &#34;steak house&#34; on your sign and menus and charge the prices they do you should deliver. We have no problem paying for a good meal but this was a joke. We will not be going back! If you really want to have a great steak which consistantly delivers large portions, reasonably priced. Make the journey to Sorrento&#39;s in Maple Park straight shot down North Avenue. When you had the best why settle for less."

  Lay out was in three different rooms.  First room contained the salads and desserts on one table.  Three salads ( potato, fruit and a caesar salad)and some smoked salmon on toast. That was it.  
I love desserts and this was pretty disappointing.  Some very tiny  and I do mean little,  maybe 1 inch squares of different bar cookies..lemon bars, brownies and some chocolate pudding in maybe a 2 inch in diameter tart shell.   And then to top it off, there was a foil pan that had some store bought cinnamon rolls that looked like they were bought out  at the last moment to fill in the empty space???  Tacky ..  Do it right or don&#39;t bother. Sigh

Getting back to the second food area, in the main dining room, had scrambled egg, bacon, sausage, french toast some kind of pasta, cod fish, macaroni and cheese, chicken wings(nice wings but no sauce or anything  to put on them) chili and corn fritters.  That was pretty much it. Had to ask for butter for the french toast. Should have been provided by the french toast.  

The final room had a chef making omelets and another person carving roast beef (the best, but again, no au jus, gravy or horseradish to put on it) pork and a piece of turkey breast.    Nothing else.

The owner seemed a bit taken back when he asked me how things were and I said, food was great, but things were missing.  He replied that if I wanted anything that was not there, I should ask.  Hmmm a buffet usuallly has everything out that should be served together.   Should I have asked for lobster?  I don&#39;t quite think that would have flown.  But just normal accompaniments would have been out.

  He went on to say that we should have been there at 9:00am and should have seen all the things they had.  we were there at 11:15.  I thought to myself, the buffet didn&#39;t start until 10:00am^^^. 

We had a second helping of the roast beef,  and the owner then did bring some horseradish sauce, I&#39;m sure he whipped up himself and it was good. Thank you!
We also found it strange that there were no vegetables nor and kind potatoes.

I know that they have just started searching brunch in the last couple of months, but it needs to be tweaked a lot.  Perhaps Raise the price and do it right.

Not sure we will rush back, but having had a regular dinner there on Xmas eve we again found that the food itself was really good, too bad this brunch needs help.
Went for lunch recently,  waitress stated..be sure to check out our FANTASIC lunch buffet.  Lemon chicken and fettuccini, lettuce salad, two dressings, I think 2 soup choices, and some left over pastries from Sunday brunch..that were not appetizing looking.  Not a thing fantastic there.  Pretty pathetic.  Good thing we ordered from the menu.  Food was decent, BUT PLEASE, DON&#39;T OFFER BUFFETS AT ALL.  BRUNCH OR LUNCH."

A friend and I were cruising around trying to find somewhere new to eat and this came on Google Maps. I went to their site on my phone and got their PDF Menu and read that they had a Crab Cake burger on Pretzel Roll - Sold! We happen to arrive at exactly the same time as the members of the band that were about to perform. Nice, live music and pretzel rolls.

I ended up getting the Domain Dupage (by Two Brothers) to drink, and boy was it delightful. I originally wanted Lagunita&#39;s IPA but they had replaced that with Ranger, it couldn&#39;t have turned out better. I did end up getting the crab cake burger and it was as delightful as I thought it would be. We sat in the seating around the bar and we were served by the bartender, Michelle (sorry if you spell it differently). I was a little apprehensive about this as it is quite easy for them to forget about you. I&#39;m happy to say that Michelle was more than attentive - she was like a ninja. I would be getting close to empty on my beer and she was there, and right as I am finishing it off there is a fresh one that appeared seemingly out of thin air.

The cover band that we arrived with was rather good as well. They played a lot of good/well known hits. They won me over when they started with a jam by The Police. 

I highly recommend John &amp; Tony&#39;s and I will be eating there again sometime soon."

All 4 meals very good, and the 2 steaks that were ordered were cooked wonderfully, there has been a rash of new steakhouses lately that just can&#39;t seem to get it right but they do.

Our service was great and every request for the evening was handled with a smile, our server was made us feel like we were at a much pricier downtown joint yet still had a sense of humor.

This place is relatively new, even though many steakhouses have been in this building, if they develop a following which I am sure they will, they could be in for the long haul here, something the suburbs really needs.

The inside is very nice and tasteful, with good bands setting the mood on the weekends.  The menu is a little small, I will admit, but I would rather have 10 good dishes than 20 subpar dishes.  Prices are maybe a little bit more than they deserve to be, but for what you get and the quality of food, you won&#39;t be able to complain.

I will be back, and will most likely make this a once a month retreat, I did like that it tries to be a more upscale locale without the snob attitudes yet still keep an air of class and elegance for the burbs.

I would reccomend that if you are looking for a good area steakhouse and don&#39;t want to pay a week&#39;s salary, spend an hour looking for parking and another hour waiting for a table, try John &amp; Tony&#39;s, you won&#39;t be dissapointed."

It was nearly February and there were still Christmas decorations up, and it was uncomfortably cold. It took far too long for anyone to come to the table; when the server finally arrived he could barely manage a drink order for two. Their iced tea is unlike any other tea I&#39;ve ever had, it tasted burnt, with artificial sweetner poured in, gross! The mozzerella sticks, stay away, it&#39;s a very unusual breading, not in a good way. And then there was the meatball sandwich, looked good; then I took the first (and last) bite, into an ice cold meatball. Disgusting! The server finally wandered back and asked if I wanted a to-go box. I explained that I wanted it taken away. He did offer a new sandwich, but from the onion-packed, ice-cold bite, I just wanted to get out of there. We finally got the check, and no one apologized for the trash food, not the server, manager, anyone! I honestly don&#39;t know what was worse the food or the service. Hope they&#39;re reading this."

I previewed the menu on the website beforehand, and it had a lot of good-looking items. The chef is also originally from Emilio&#39;s Tapas. John and Tonys is located in a spot that never seems to hold a restaurant for long, so I thought maybe this would be different. Last night, we tried it out.

The restaurant is recently remodeled and hosts live jazz bands in the bar area. It wasn&#39;t very crowded, despite us arriving around 7:30 on a Saturday night. The crowd was also a decidedly older crowd.

I ordered the roasted chicken that came with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, and red cabbage with bacon and pearl onions. The BF ordered a cheeseburger and the french onion soup. The meal started off to a good start with hot crusty bread and a roasted garlic/shallot spread. The garlic spread was awesome. The salad that came with my meal was small and unremarkable. The BF&#39;s soup was tasty, but there wasn&#39;t enough cheese and there was a colony of bay leaves at the bottom of the bowl. We also ordered the saganaki which had a nice crust on it.

When our meals came out, I was a little disappointed in the chicken. The skin was soft and soggy, and the chicken seemed reheated. The mashed potatoes and green beans were average. The best part of my meal was the red cabbage, which I probably could have eaten a whole plate full of. The BF&#39;s cheeseburger and fries were average as well. The best part of his meal was the grilled pretzel roll.

Prices were reasonable, and there is a pretty good wine list. However, there are many other similar places in the western suburbs where you can get a better roast chicken or cheeseburger. Maybe we ordered the wrong items, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back to try something else unless I know it will be better."

Normally their brunch is $15/adult, but I guess because it was a Bears game day, they lowered the price and had different food offerings.
Food was ok...there was a crepe and omelette station, french toast, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, chicken wings, chili, salad, a few dried out desserts, chips and salsa, way too creamy pasta and some others not worth mentioning.
The coffee was not included in the price, which I think should be told to the patron on a brunch day.  Every other brunch around includes soft drinks, tea and coffee.
Kids price was $6.95 and didn&#39;t include juice either and the waitress didn&#39;t mention that either.  Juice cost $2.69 each.
My kids are all under 6; they barely eat anything.  I think it&#39;s unfair to charge $7 for brunch and almost $3 more for one cup of apple juice.
Our waitress was non-existent.  I hate tipping 20% for a brunch that I basically serve myself at and had to track the waitress down to get a refill on coffee!
The only positives are...it is a beautiful restaurant...very clean; 
the omelette station was good and an older gentleman (owner?) came by our table and offered my kids complimentary ice cream.
We probably won&#39;t go back anytime soon.  The total price with tip was $70.  I can eat at the Clubhouse in Oakbrook for that price and kids are free!"

Right from the beginning it was bad. We got there and one of our water glasses had lipstick on the rim and didn&#39;t have any ice in it. I was with 2 young kids and we got kids meals but we never got any crayons and they gave the kids glass drinks with no straws. We also got the artisan bread which was very good, but it took a long time to get butter. The worst part of the evening was when they brought my lasagna with meat sauce when I specifically asked for marinara sauce with no meat. After taking my meal the server came back and informed me that the whole lasagna had meat in it and they could not remake it so she could bring me spaghetti and marinara sauce instead. I got that in about 5 minutes and it looked very rushed and the sauce was just sloppily poured into a pile on top. The sauce was basically watery tomato juice and I didn&#39;t even eat it. The kids meals were just grilled cheeses but they cost 8 dollars! This place is very overpriced and disorganized. Don&#39;t waste your time."

Service was prompt and considerate since my friends were late, the owner sent a cup of soup of the day and warm bread to go with my cocktail, while I waited for my friends who were delayed. I was made to feel at home while I waited alone for my 3 friends.
Upon their arrival we ordered drinks and dinner. I had the coconut shrimp dinner which came with a marvelous pineapple dip. My friends ordered, a pasta dish with chicken ( she asked for a side that did not come with the dish and the server brought it no charge). Parmesan crusted pork chops and a Chicken Marsala for the other 2 at my table.
We enjoyed the food very much. Everyone commented on the generous portions. I was proud that my friends were pleased because it was my suggestion to meet here.
The owner came over to meet us and he was very friendly. My friends like the location because it was midway between our separate homes. I will come back more often... made reservations for the Easter Brunch with my family."

We had the Prime Rib and it was too die for!  All of the rolls, sides, and salads with the meal were top notch.

Not a good first impression. Finally, a bus boy came to greet me and help.  The owner John walked up, offered me coffee while I waited in the foyer for friends, and tried to look for the reservation we had.  He did admit he sometimes writes down the dates wrong, so make sure they&#39;ve got it right when you call.  While waiting, I noticed a lot of artwork was moving out.  When I mentioned it, John took me on a tour of the restaurant paintings that were done by his daughter, whom I met, and told me about the multi use room where they were just clearing.  I liked to hear the enthusiasm in his voice and appreciated his hospitality.

The interior is darker wood and offers a fireplace on the west end of the main dining.  Hopefully, the lighting will be adequate for the evening.  The east area has two bars, seating with a musician area.  John mentioned the previous night&#39;s artist was a member of the Drifters and another recent artist was a jazz singer.  The southwest corner is an enclosed multi use room which was being converted to a swing dance floor for the evening.  John and Tony&#39;s offers dinner and movie nights and this room also serves as the theatre.

The brunch menu was one page and offered a variety of items for $7.95 along with a separate lunch menu.  I opted for the omelet with Spinach, mushroom and goat cheese. A build your own with four ingredients for the same price as three is listed.  We were served a starter of small cinnamon rolls providing a nice touch. There was too much goat cheese and not enough egg and trying to eat the omelet was like eating paste. The meal comes with a very small portion of diced fried potatoes (which were slightly overdone) and one slice of toast; the size is enough to satisfy an appetite.  Coffee and tea are $2.25 with refills which I thought was pricey.

One of my friends had the dates wrapped in bacon (sides on the lunch menu) and French toast. These days anything wrapped in bacon in a sure thing, and she said this idea was on the top of the list.  

The bus boy did a phenomenal job keeping our beverages filled, asking if the meal was satisfactory and clearing.  I wish every restaurant would have someone taking pride in the service as this gentlemen did.  

If you want something a little more elegant, this is place to go.  If you want local and casual without the feeling of one of those generic family restaurants, go to the Olde North Pancake House just to the West, they&#39;ve been a staple for a long time.

As a side note, watch your time on Sunday.  With an enormous church across the street in session, and three Sheriff cars patrolling the intersection, you may run into traffic.  The Sherriff have orange cones all over that intersection."

We used to try different establishment&#39;s but  have become regulars at John and Tony&#39;s.  The quality of this buffet is excellent with a great selection of food for just a little more than what we paid to order breakfast off the menu  at other local restaurant s.   They have kept certain breakfast  foods as a staple, but change up some other items.  In addition to their awesome omelet station, they had pulled pork at the carving station (with a separate barbeque sauce, so you can choose how much you want) along with ham and turkey.  The buffet had tender fall off the bone ribs and figs wrapped in bacon.

We were sadly mistaken, who knew simple pasta dishes at an Italian restaurant could seem so difficult to make? I ordered the gluten free pasta aglio from the signature pasta part of the menu. When I got my meal the pasta was the most overcooked pasta I&#39;ve ever been served, the broccoli was just plain disgusting and was equally as overcooked and the sun dried tomatoes had the texture of raisins. But that&#39;s not the worst part. The menu claims my dish has a light herb garlic oil and my dish tasted like nothing. I even tried putting pepper, cheese and more oil on and the &#34;pasta&#34; dish just soaked it right up. I rarely complain when going out to eat and wasn&#39;t surprised when my sisters Chicken Marsala was drenched in sauce, and her side of fettuccine Alfredo looked like it had been sitting under a heater for days. Not to mention that it tasted like nothing as well. My dad had the Reuben and you could tell it was disgusting based on how little of it he ate. Our waitress could care less and it seemed as if she had heard the same story many times before. It&#39;s amazing that this place got 3.5 stars because the cooks could care less if their customers get food poisoning or not. I&#39;ve never experienced such horrible food in my life. Don&#39;t let the &#34;Italian steakhouse&#34; fool you and I highly recommend you stay away. Apparently this place doesn&#39;t know what seasoning is or food for that matter."

The food for dinner was great.  Relaxed and elegant atmosphere. On 4/21/12, Saturday dinner, my husband ordered the bacon wrapped date appetizer - delicious red pepper sauce compliments it so well!  The blue cheese salad dressing had plenty of cheese and flavor, but the lettuce was bitter.  I had the prime rib, my husband the filet, and both were excellent.  The sweet potato puree was too sweet.  My one recommendation would be to add salad forks.  I really don&#39;t want to use the same fork for salad and then my entrée.  Pleasant &amp; attentive waitress &amp; bus boy service.  I wish everyone would try to think about what they are wearing as some of the customers were just too casual for this establishment - please leave the baseball caps at home.

I&#39;d rather eat grass than eat at FoodBarz again (the only other option for lunch in my building), so I was excited to see that Grill Chasers was coming to the office on this lovely Hump Day. 

Here&#39;s what I had: 

Chicago Bird Skewers: I had mine doused in Buffalo Burn sauce. The meat was tender, juicy, and seasoned well. The sauce was not exactly your typical buffalo sauce, but really good nonetheless, and not too hot. 

Jalapeno Ranch: This came as a &#34;Chaser&#34; for my skewers, and it was so good that I felt it deserved to be mentioned separately. Buttery, slightly spicy, and a great complement to the buffalo sauce. 

Roti Prata Pancake - I had no idea what to expect here, and what I got was the lightest and fluffiest flatbread you could ever imagine. I had no intention of eating this because I knew it was filled with butter, but then decided it was worth the obscene amount of calories it probably contained. 

The staff was nice and the line didn&#39;t take too long. Come back to Rosemont soon, Grill Chasers :)"

However, the food was very mediocre. I ordered the chipotle fries and the chipotle sauce was basically spicy mayo. The sauce made the fries much worse. $4 for the chipotle fries.
I ordered the grilled veggie and goat cheese wrap, the wrap was a bit burnt, which made everything bitter tasting. The grilled veggie was nice but overall the whole wrap needed some sauce or some melted cheese to it to blend it all together. $8 for that sandwich.
Overall for a $12 meal, I am expecting much more. I could get a very decent meal at a sit down restaurant for $12. 
However, overall the lincolnshire food truck event was a disappointment, only 5 trucks overall so honestly, it&#39;s a monopoly because there isnt much option."

I&#39;m really picky when it comes to chicken, so i can&#39;t blame Grill Chasers for my picky tastebuds. 

I ordered the Ole&#39; Bird skewer which is chicken infused with orange and lime juice, garlic, chipotle peppers,  and ancho chili powder. I also tried to get the jalapeno mac and cheese but I was told they didn&#39;t have it. So that was disappointing. 

The mango salsa that accompanied the skewer was good. I also loved the Roti Prata pancake. But the skewer wasn&#39;t great. The first piece was good: full of flavor and slightly spicy (for my tastebuds, anyway. Others might consider it very spicy). But the second piece was chewy... not good chicken at all. I didn&#39;t even bother eating the third piece. 

The service was great though. The cashier was super friendly and the cooks had really upbeat attitudes. My entire order from start to finish took less than 5 minutes, so that&#39;s a big plus.

I might try them again if they return and have the jalapeno mac and cheese... maybe give the veggie wrap plate a chance. But I&#39;ll pass on the chewy chicken."

The grilled wings were outstanding the first time I tried them.  The pieces were bursting with flavor and had the perfect amount of char.  The second time I had the wings, however, there was a marked difference.  The pieces were smaller and the meat was noticeably drier.  The chicken skewers were good, but Grill Chasers does not give you enough for the price - I definitely wanted more on my plate.  The Malaysian Roti Prata pancakes redeemed the dish, though - good stuff!  Finally, the mac and cheese was disappointing.  It was simply too bland.

Grill Chasers has their chicken portioned for sampling, but the samples are generously portioned so you will be happy with the $5 you spend.  They come with a Malatian pancake that is WONDERFUL!  It is very similar to a French crepe, but smaller.

The line was super long and the food was mediocre at best. We ordered two different types of chicken skewers which were $5 a piece and very skimpy. You get one dipping sauce per skewer but I ordered an extra one for of course an extra charge. The problem with this was I noticed I didn&#39;t get it once I sat down. The roti that came with the skewers was good but very greasy. The jalapeño mac and cheese was overpriced as well. It was a tiny portion and Kraft mac and cheese is more gourmet than the stuff they are serving here. I love mac and cheese, yet I threw this stuff away.

She sent her menu way ahead of time allowing me to post them around the studio to get my fellow employees excited about the visit. I asked Jami if she could provide special items from her menu and she graciously agreed. 

Unfortunately for me, I had a family emergency on the day Grill Chasers came to the studio, but I know from Jami&#39;s phone call that the truck was on time and ready to serve lunch at the appointed time. There were absolutely no complaints about the food. Everyone loved it. No one complained about the prices or the portions. I hear the Bacon Beer Cheese Fries were delicious and the chicken was tender and flavorful. My co-workers also told me that the staff on the truck was super friendly and prepared the food quickly.

A couple of friends actually bought me some food that I was able to eat the next day. I had chicken skewers with the mango salsa. Even reheated it was excellent. Did I mention the mango salsa? Really, really good. There was another sauce, too. I don&#39;t know what it was called, but it was also delicious. As mentioned in other reviews, the roti prata pancake was also wonderful.

This is walking distance from where we live in DT Mount Prospect &amp; I&#39;m so happy a nicer restaurant with GREAT service is finally here!

The bang shrimp appetizer &amp; calamari is amazing! I&#39;ve only tried pasta here so far but both were amazing, carbonara &amp; gnocchi! 

I haven&#39;t made it in for their Tuesday happy hour yet (wine is on tap!) but I&#39;m looking forward to trying. 

Again, GREAT SERVICE!"

(Jake&#39;s was a pizza place with a bar and lots of regulars.)  Trezeros has totally transformed this place so much so that I don&#39;t even remember exactly how it was laid out before.  It&#39;s now classy, upscale and definitely a nice place to bring anyone. 
 
We went with our friends and had a very good meal. Tahara was our server and she did a great job.  All in all it was an enjoyable time.

I didn&#39;t give it 5 stars only because my idea of a 5 star Italian restaurant is one with thick red sauces, meat lasagna, cheeses, breads, and red wines like Toscana or Maggiano&#39;s.  Where you eat as much as you can, bring home leftovers and don&#39;t have room for dessert.

At Trezeros I ate all my spaghetti and the one big meatball it came with and still had room for dessert.  Fortunately I did because they brought out a piece of carrot cake as big as Rhode Island. We all shared it and It was wonderful!

Not to take anything away from Trezeros.  I&#39;d go back in a heart beat.   I just know when I do I will leave pleasantly satisfied versus stuffed to the point where I have to loosen my belt because I ate too much (which happens everytime I leave a 5 star Italian restaurant.)

By the way, the name &#39;Tre Zero S&#39; came from the fact this restaurant is at Three Zero Two Northwest Highway. The &#39;S&#39; at the end of Trezeros is supposed to be a backwards 2."

We are very excited for this place to succeed...we need some great non-chain dining options in this town.  That said, we were sad to see it less than crowded on a Saturday night.  That is where our disappointment ended.  The staff were perfectly pleasant and attentive without being intrusive.  The decor is clean &amp; modern.
We started with some cocktails and the bar happily accommodated some special requests to our satisfaction.  We decided to split one appetizer &amp; chose the Italian Beef Won Tons.  So good and just enough for the four of us to have a taste.
For dinner we ordered the Pork Porterhouse, Lamb Shank, Parmesan Crusted Chicken &amp; the Filet Trio.  All were perfectly prepared &amp; tasted wonderful. 
The pricing was on the higher end, but they delivered excellence.  We vowed to return again."

Completely renovated. The decor was very nice and the service was excellent. The menu had a moderate selection of Italian foods. There was free bread before dinner and and I ordered the pizza Margharita. I would give this establishment a rating of 3.5 stars only because the food didn&#39;t really have much flavor. However, the quality of the ingredients didn&#39;t seem to be the issue. Perhaps on another visit I will try a different food item that might be more flavorful."

I took my three children here for dinner.  One had chicken parm. Sandwich and fries he said that was good.  I had shrimp scampi was very bland.  One had a burger took two bites and said it was bad.  The last kid had spaghetti and meat ball took a few bites and it was bland.  Service is good the food not so much.  I will not be back way too much money and to throw the food away.

Staff was very friendly but we sat for 10 minutes after being seated in the dining room before our waiter came over. He did apologize and said he was working the bar and had to wait to be relieved. The food was excellent. We both had the wedge salad and the porterhouse pork chop. The chop was cooked perfectly and at a cost of $20.00 for a 16oz chop, it is a good value. The menu is small but has a variety of items. Appetizers are also 1/2 price before 6:00pm. We&#39;ll definitely be going back. This restaurant is a nice addition to Mt prospect."

We had calamari and bang bang shrimp omg so good! I had the lobster ravioli and my boyfriend had the lamb shank. Both were outstanding! Drinks and service were good too!

Please don&#39;t review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you&#39;re connected in any way to the owner or employees.
This restaurant has potential.  Friendly greeting from hostess as soon as we walked in on a Saturday evening.  Disappointed that we were seated in the bar although the dining room was not filled.  Very stark, needs something to cozy the place up as the tables are bare-a tiny bud vase with a fresh flower or a votive candle would do the trick!  Our waitress was helpful in recommending drinks and food. Ordered the asparagus salad.  It was good but would have liked a bit more dressing as I could hardly taste any.  Chicken Marsala was average, steak was good but potatoes that came with it were overcooked and were in desperate need of seasoning!!  With a few tweaks this could be a nice addition to the neighborhood.  We&#39;ll be back to try it again!!"

This restaurant should be a good addition to the Mount Prospect / Arlington Heights area, as long as they step back and focus on the service side of the business.  

The Pro&#39;s
- From the mussels to the lobster ravioli everything our group tried was excellent.  I want to go back and try more things that I did get to try the first time.

- whenever something didn&#39;t go well with the service they were willing to fix it.

- the owners genuine interest in the happiness of their patrons

- the decor

The Con&#39;s
- didn&#39;t have our reservation. 
- the service needs significant upgrading.  For example, wine was served without us being offered a taste.  One time they brought the wrong bottle and poured it before we could tell them it wasn&#39;t what we ordered.  They were willing to take it back, which was good, but shows how new this staff is to the service business.  
- Meals not timed coming out of the kitchen, children&#39;s meals received 10 minutes before adults.  Luckily we had fully charged iPhones to distract the kids once they were finished eating before we got out meal.

Al in all, a restaurant that I really want to see do well and based on the quality of the food it should.  Would recommend everyone in the area give this place a try."

Husband and I had a 6:30pm reservation on a Friday night.  We were seated in the bar area and within a few minutes, every table was taken, so business is well.  I give an A+ for service all the way around.  Appetizer, we had the beef wontons bc I had read reviews they were good.  I didn&#39;t realize they were fried, so I probably wouldn&#39;t get them again, although they were tasty.  For the entrees, I had the Swordfish and my husband had the Chicken Vesuvio.  Mine was delicious and a perfect portion.  The Chicken Vesuvio was sad looking with 2 tiny chicken breast.  My husband said it tasted good but he wouldn&#39;t get it again.  That&#39;s his favorite dish at most restaurants, so he just wouldn&#39;t get it here again.  We will definitely go back to try other dishes, maybe the pastas."

My lobster ravioli was delicious.  We also split the colossal meatball - delicious - and the Italian beef wontons - very unique and delicious!  The vanilla bean gelato was outstanding.  They have a good wine and craft beer selection to go with their cocktail menu. 

This restaurant is desperately needed in downtown Mount Prospect.  You can get quality Italian meals for the same price you pay for bar food at the other local restaurants.  The most expensive item on the menu was $25. You should definitely give it a try."

Chef John has outdone himself with a wonderful menu that satisfy every pallet. The service was very friendly and prompt.
     The building was completely renovated from the ground up and it looks gorgeous. It provides a place for upscale dining at a fraction of the price. The restaurant has a modern look that is also cool and inviting.
     Our meal started by sampling some appetizers and they did not dissapoint. The Bang Shrimp were out of this world and the horseradish crusted clams were spectacular. However, the Italian beef won tons were out of this world. A must have for any true Chicago eater!
     We then ordered plenty of entrees and proceeded to share them amongst eachother. The swordfish sandwich was bright and vibrant with an array of flavors that awaken your tastebuds. The hand cut fries that accompanied them were a wonderful pairing and seasoned well.
     I ordered the pork porterhouse. Let me tell you, this is the mother of all entrees. This may go down as the single best piece of pork I have ever eaten. It was a thick cut that was cooked and tempted to pefection. The cut of meat was placed ever so lightly on a bed of mashed potatoes that were only outshined by the fact that a giant cut of meat was resting upon them. The glaze on the pork was a beautiful addition to the meal and complemented everything on my plate very well. Needless to say, my plate was cleared. I would have liked it clean had I not been in such a public place!
     Desert was a must. The carrot cake we ordered was GIANT and it had all of the flavor we could have ever asked for. I was so full by meals end, but I could not help endulging in such a decadant dessert. 
     Overall I highly recommend Trezeros to any and everyone. It has something on the menu that will satisfy everyone. It is so nice to have a run down pizza joint renovated and replaced with such a wonderful new establishment. I will be returning for many more meals. When you go there, I will be the man eating everything in site. Be sure to say hello!"

I must say I was  extremely pleased with both. Jack our bartender was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. He was also very honest about what you thought were winners and what we&#39;re just OK. He was spot on with his recommendations.  Italian beef Won Ton were  outstanding.  The beef was very moist inside the roll and paired well with the giardinaire. We  added a little homemade marinara sauce which worked out well. The bang shrimp appetizer was very good also. Portion was plentiful but  the shrimp were a touch over cooked.  Easy to do with such a light batter.  We also tried one of their sausage pizzas. The crust was nice and crispy, and the toppings were great.  Nice size drinks and nice atmosphere. Can&#39;t wait to come back and try some of the entrées.  A welcome addition  to the real humdrum restaurant atmosphere in Mount Prospect. Thanks, Jack for a great experience!"

Not a fan of the much hearlded Beef Won Tons,they had a slightly sour taste that I did not like.

We walked in around 3pm the place has a musty smell. The identity of the place is confusing. Are you a fine dinning as you claim or a sports Bar? The place is missing a soul. Large TVs just hanging wherever theres a space on the wall. The Bartender started of a little cocky then become polite after knowing we were in the industry. 
2-The food tastes good except the fact that the shrimps and the mussles were the tiniest you can find in the market but we enjoyed a hole bar to ourselves since there was nobody there.
3-The worst thing in my opinion is the fact that this place is run by little kids. Customer Sce is what its all about. Try calling and see how you will be treated. Kids hanging in the front to do nothing, if you ask anything you get a quick No answer, no effort whatsoever. And if you insist you are bodersome to them. Really? We just spent a huge check my friend and I to be mistreated by a teenager? FORGET ABOUT IT! Good luck! Another one that will bite the dust very soon.

It was basically like eating dessert for breakfast, but that&#39;s fine by me! I mean, there was a sliced banana on top, so that&#39;s one point in the healthy column...right?

At 11 am on a Thursday morning Jelly Cafe was pretty empty. Our waitress was prompt and friendly and our food came out really fast. My decaf coffee was always full and and hot and waters were full.

Their menu has so many things that sounded delicious, but the banana bread french toast definitely caught my eye, and here&#39;s why...

4 slices of banana bread. I repeat... Four. Slices. Topped with chocolate chips, sliced bananas, some sort of cream frosting, and powdered sugar. So freakin&#39; good! Mind you, it&#39;s extremely filling and super sweet so despite how much I enjoyed it I was only able to eat about half of it. It reheated nicely as leftovers though! With all this sweetness I was glad I got a side of bacon to even things out. The bacon was thick-cut and very good - the perfect addition to French toast.

After bookmarking, browsing and drooling over the photos of Jelly Cafe dishes on Yelp, I decided to give this place a try with Jacqueline B. for breakfast. 

Upon entering, I was greeted sweetly by multiple waitresses and was seated right away at a booth near the door. I have never been called &#34;babe&#34; so many times by women! The employees seemed appreciative and sweet to their customers. My coffee and water was served right away and I was excited to check the place out.

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just a newer concept or if it&#39;s a bit of an eyesore to me but I couldn&#39;t help but notice the open ceiling. I&#39;ve noticed places acquiring the open ceiling look more and more but I&#39;m not sure how I feel about it. The place is bubbly, colorful and happy so for some reason the industrial, hardware look on the ceiling didn&#39;t mesh well with the rest of the decor. This wasn&#39;t anything to be taken seriously or a reason to be given less stars, it was merely a first thought.

After browsing the yummy options in the menu, I decided on the Almond Berry French Toast...mostly because I had seen a few photos from fellow Yelpers who had gotten this picturesque dish and I had to get it for myself (and take my own pictures of course). One thing I must say is, HOW PERFECT. This was the prettiest french toast I had ever eaten! The toast itself was covered in tiny almond slivers which gave it a satisfying nutty flavor and crunch, they were so perfectly yellow and yet still soft and pillowy! And yes, I am still talking about the toast! Aside from the nuts, there was powdered sugar and vibrant strawberries and blueberries on the toast and plate as well - excellent photo op. The waitress came by often enough to get us re-fills on coffee, make sure we&#39;re doing alright, etc. 

Overall, I&#39;d love to come back here because of it&#39;s convenient location to me and these dishes that come out of the kitchen are beautiful AND delicious!

Note: When they say it&#39;s a &#34;breakfast &amp; brunch&#34; cafe, they mean it. Jelly Cafe closes at 3pm for the day so make it here early :)"

My scrambled eggs were overcooked and dry. The corned beef hash was mediocre. My wife was underwhelmed with her omelet.

The restaurant draws a good crowd. Maybe we ordered the wrong items...but eggs? If you can&#39;t get eggs right, well...you know.

And with the crowd comes the noise, and the restaurant does get loud. 

I suppose if you&#39;re in the neighborhood and craving breakfast, Jelly Cafe might be alright.

But with Katie&#39;s Kitchen, Egg Harbor Cafe, and a few other places in the area, you could do much better."

We were ready for this jelly and had a late Saturday brunch here.  Menu offers plentiful breakfasty options like pancakes, crepes, and various egg dishes all day, in addition to lunch-type stuff like sandwiches and wraps.  I tried the huevos rancheros, which was a hearty serving of chorizo, beans, and melted cheese on a crispy tortilla and 2 eggs prepared your way. I thought it was a little heavy handed on the salsa though, and the cubed potatoes were a bit wet. 

A pot roast skillet was enjoyed by the husband, although we both thought the corned beef hash was a swing and a whiff.  CBH had a lack of potatoes, the beef was stringy and kind of crispy... but we didn&#39;t care for it.  A-OK service."

Place is small and loud. Have a little patio section for a couple of tables. Tables are very close to each other so don&#39;t expect too much privacy. The bathrooms are facing the tables which make it a little awkward to go to. Very nice inside though. 

Took the waiter 10 min to take our order since it was busy. Started off with orange juice which was a little on the sweeter side but good overall. Unfortunately, they don&#39;t give you any straws.

I ordered a half breakfast panini.The waitress made a mistake and brought out a full sandwich. I was charged the higher price and questioned that since it was her mistake. The manager came out and took the extra half sandwich and said she was throwing it out. I&#39;ve never been to a restaurant that did anything like that when a mistake was made. Very poor customer service. There were only two tables of customers so it was not hopping. I will not be going there again and will pass the word to my neighbors, friends and associates. I would give it zero stars if that was a choice. The food was mediocre.

I heard from the owner today regarding my visit. The owner&#39;s rendition of the incident was not quite accurate and was harsh in his/her response. They accused me of being &#34;proud&#34; of not leaving a tip and that was not true. I simply stated that I did not leave a tip. They wanted to make me feel bad that I slighted the 18 year old waiter. This all comes down to good customer service which there was none, That&#39;s fine.

As you can tell this was a mother-daughter lunch date and this was the perfect spot.  The food was delicious and I would definitely order my pot roast skillet again.  The pot roast was tender, juicy and flavorful and the combination of pot roast and gouda was awesome.  I tried some of my mom&#39;s crab crepe which was pretty good as well.  My mom can be very picky at times and she liked her dish which says something.  The crepe was slightly sweet but not overly so and there was plenty of crab inside the crepes even though it was mainly mushed up.

This place is known for its hash Benedicts with homemade corned beef. I ended up getting the Florentine Benedict which was fine. The English muffin is usually crunchy which combines well with the eggs. Unfortunately my muffin got pretty soggy so I was quite disappointed. My partner in crime did get the hash bennie and it was very good. I don&#39;t even like corned beef hash and I could not stop eating off his plate, much to his chagrin.

I ordered the Foster Banana crepes that were doused in about 4 pds of butter? The heck prompt them to cook in all that oil?? Then the nerve to serve additional butter in a cuppie thingy. I couldn&#39;t eat it, left it and thought ok the bacon might redeem the $10 I just lost in this dish. Dang that bacon was thick, fatty and undercooked. 

My husband ordered the biscuits w gravy he said he felt parched due to the salt contents in that dish.

Then my daughter ordered the avocado meatless burrito and her avocado was brown and mushed nothing like the pics seen here on Yelp. What a fraud! 

Not worth our family&#39;s money, 

Friendly host love the fact the host takes his toddler to work but doesn&#39;t make up that disaster of the foster banana ( sick to my stomach yuk)"

Me and my wife started our breakfast with the beignets and jelly (they make their own jelly from scratch) and they were delicious! The beignets were dusted in sugar/cinnamon, very light and warm. Jelly was sweet and kissed with some tang. A definite must!

For the &#34;entree&#34;, I ordered the blue crab crepes (blue crab meat, mushrooms, and asparagus tossed in a delicious creme sauce) topped with a chipotle aoili, accompanied by their famous home red potatoes. Great taste! My wife had their ham steak, eggs and home red potatoes with a side of pancakes. Delicious of couse. 

The service was good. A latin lady served us. She was attentive but was out there. And I mean out there as in she might have a little crazy in her. Lol I really don&#39;t mean that in any disrespect, however whenever she&#39;d come to our table to ask us how everything was going, she&#39;d literally scream out her sentences. And it wasn&#39;t that loud in the restaurant. A little annoying. She&#39;d said a couple of things that did not make sense either (to generate small talk). But I rather have her service than the really crappy &#34;what the hell do you want?&#34; kind.

I got the lox scramble and it was so good. Usually it can be really salty or fishy, depending on where you get it but it was amazing. My date decided to be unhealthy and got the Nutella and strawberries waffles. They were amazing. So worth running a marathon after.

My first experience was about a month ago. I was in the area and stopped in for lunch with my boss. We were greeted and welcomed in a friendly manner. Once the servers heard it was our first time they brought us their beignets and jelly - the jelly is homemade and phenomenal. The server gave great advice on what to try and I left highly satisfied. 

I loved it so much I took my boyfriend their today for breakfast. I had told him about my first experience and insisted we go again. The portions are a great size, he got full before he finished his plate (which is a rarity for him). I left full and satisfied and took half my skillet home. 

This is a must try place. The 2nd time around they were busier because it was a Sunday but it was only a 10 min wait. We looked at the menu and we were ready to order by the time we had been seated."

I got a plate with corned beef hash, 2 eggs sunny side up and rustic potatoes. Comes with a side of toast or pancakes. Got the toast as we had jelly cheesecake French toast. 

Food is really delicious. The rustic potatoes tasted really well cooked and not burnt and not dripping with oil.  The beef hash was fresh to taste and also tasted scrumptious. 

The highlight of the brunch was the French toast. It&#39;s basically two pieces of French toast stuck together with cream cheese and sprinkled with their jelly. Vey sweet but delicious. 

Over all the food was good. For a part of 4 who eat like crazy we ended up spending 15$ each. So it&#39;s very worth it.

Hubs ordered a burger with bacon and egg, hold the cheddar cheese. It came without the bacon and egg, and without the cheese. That was quickly remedied when we pointed it out to our server. He said it was good and cooked to the right temp. 
I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast special. The steak was super tender, the breading a little weird, but overall it was good. The sausage gravy on top was very tasty. The side of potatoes were fresh real potatoes, not that shredded in a bag hash brown stuff. That alone could be a meal!

Rough meaning I drank way more than any normal human should...especially when they have to work the next day! Curse my company for making us work the day after the 4th. Honestly, our parking lot was empty and the commute to work was without any traffic to speak of. A couple of my buddies at work were in the same head pounding, dehydrated state as me yesterday and we decided the only way to semi ease our pain was to fill our faces with some greasy brunch style goodness during our lunch hour. 

Enter Jelly Cafe. Imagine my surprise when I was able to eat a normally super greasy brunch meal but with less of the mess.

I&#39;ve been seeing all my Yelp friends check in here on the daily so I knew this must be the right spot for brunch food. We walked in and I was surprised we were the only table dining in the entire corner cafe! The good with that is there was a lot of parking and we had very attentive service throughout. 

The menu at Jelly Cafe is simple with some good options but missing a little something in my humble opinion. With a name like Jelly Cafe, I would love to see more types of homemade jellies...tons of cool flavors...maybe even a jelly flight! That would spice up this cafe and bring it up a notch in my book. But alas, they have their one signature jam...I&#39;m not even sure what flavor it was but it reminded my friends and I of the lingonberry sauce you get at Ikea ~berrylicious. 

My friends and I got the beignets &amp; jelly which should be their signature item coming with four of the little guys and their jelly for $2.50. Good deal and they are so delicious! Each is a ball of warm, soft goodness covered in brown sugar - not your usual beignet - but good all the same. I didn&#39;t even need to dip it in the accompanying jelly to enjoy the little balls.

For my main dish I had the Hash Bennie and loved it. They have five styles of Eggs Benedict and this sounded the most appealing to me with their homemade corned beef hash in addition to the usual eggs benedict sandwich. I loved this dish but it just tasted a bit more - dare I say - healthy that the norm. I liked it! It was just under $10 and came with potatoes. Not too bad but also a bit more than my usual brunch diner spots.

Jelly hit the spot for my hungover coworkers and I without breaking the bank or putting us into a fattening food comatosa state. Although I&#39;m not dying to go back, I wouldn&#39;t mind venturing in once more. Up the jelly offerings, Jelly! :)"

Jelly Cafe has a slightly more unique menu like what you&#39;d find at Egg Harbor but without the extremely long wait (yet). The setting is comfortable and the service is good.  Overall, everything was cooked very well with good texture and flavor without being overly sweet or salty.

Beignets &amp; Jelly - You&#39;ve probably seen everyone who posts a picture get this, and for a good reason. These are fried perfectly so that the outside is crunchy while the inside is steaming hot and chewy. This pairs perfectly with the jelly on the side and is a MUST TRY item on your trip.

Croque Madame - Good flavor, the ham and the cheese match well together and the sandwich doesn&#39;t seem overly salty. The egg was prepared well and tied the entire dish together. The french toast could have been done a little better, maybe crispier and sweeter but this didn&#39;t make the dish bad.

Hash Bennie - Excellent texture on the hash browns, excellent flavor on the corned beef. The hollandaise sauce wasn&#39;t too distracting and the house red potatoes with sauteed onions accompanied the benedict perfectly. These potatoes are seriously good, they rival the ones made by Egg Harbor.

Pot roast skillet - the pot roast is done well, not too salty and not overcooked. The best part about this is that it&#39;s not overly saucy since too much gravy can ruin the rest of the dish (by making it too wet and salty). All the other elements (gouda cheese, onions, mushrooms) helped to support the flavor of the pot roast.

Cream of mushroom soup - great body and flavor (almost like a mushroom bisque).

Chicken sandwich - Probably the best I&#39;ve had from any of the local breakfast restaurants. The chicken was perfectly cooked and tender and accompanied by fresh avocado and tomato. The real star of the dish was probably the bacon, adding a burst of flavor the tied everything together.

Pancakes - Light and fluffy, done very well.

The food here really speaks for itself and I can&#39;t wait to come back soon."

We&#39;ve been back at least six times since and have asked for Rosa every time.

Coffee could be better, but they give you the carafe so at least it&#39;s plentiful. We&#39;ve never waited for longer than five minutes to be seated.

It&#39;s a cutely designed restaurant open for breakfast and lunch and I am never disappointed-- with the exception of the beignets, which are yummy little sugar donut holes and not legit beignets. Other than that, the food is good and good quality! Some places you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re gonna get when you order a side of fruit. Here it&#39;s always fresh, with variety and a decent portion. You can&#39;t go wrong with the skillets or the omelettes, and the homemade biscuits are pretty good, gravy, too. I found the andouille gravy lacking in that andouille flavor but it was still delicious. I also can&#39;t say enough about the servers and bussers. They are so friendly and efficient, I&#39;m never wanting for anything, including my pot of coffee they provide on your table. My service has been stellar, though I&#39;ve never been during a peak time- and I do imagine they get quite busy. If you&#39;re looking for a straight up breakfast, this is the place.

The service at Jelly Cafe is consistently as great as their food.

Fluffy eggs. Spongy flapjacks. Sticky syrup. All good but the jelly... Raspberry-frickin-Jelly... and it accompanies four fresh fried fritters flocked with cinnamon and sugar hot from the kitchen... HEAVEN ON A PLATE. Beignets, they call &#39;em. [Ben-YAYS]

The whole crew is sincere and attentive but not overbearing. From the host to the server to the bus... always friendly. Such a pleasant experience every time.

This place has seemed to grow into the best breakfast spot in Mt. Prospect and possibly the NW burbs.

Situated on the South end of a beautiful park with a pond, playground, tennis courts, and jogging path, this spot is the perfect place for a relaxing start to a beautiful day.

Hunger had set in and I was on the Yelp app locating a good place to have lunch.  Luckily for both parties, Jelly Cafe popped up as a local option and once I saw the food porn that Sarah S. provided of her Hash Bennie from July 2013, I was like hell to the yeah!

The place is cutesy in decor.  Nicer than your average cafe and surroundings quaint enough to enjoy the time whether solo or with a group.  Now if only they could offer Wi-Fi, I could have had my Chromebook in their with me taking care of some needed work, whilst enjoying my Bennie.

The food was good, as I was thoroughly satisfied with my order.  Service was good and my waiter made some small talk while ordering and checking back.  Food came out in a reasonable amount of time as they were having a good amount of business during lunch on a weekday.  
I&#39;m crazy about Eggs Benedict and homemade Hollandaise, which is what my waiter responded when asked whether it was real or canned.  Another detail which caught my eye via reviews was the mention of Beignets.  I&#39;ll tell you any place offering Beignets should be a must and your response to whether or not to have them should always be &#34;of course!&#34;  Beignets with jelly are a must.  The pairing of this sugar topped, light and airy French donut with a sour jelly, is perfect.  Previous experiences had left me having them solo or with a caramel dipping sauce.  This was the right amount of sweet for me.

Most folks know that Chicago is known for spectacular breakfast and brunch.  The suburbs of Chicagoland are riddled with chain eateries which offer some good staples but it&#39;s in these random Mom and Pop cafes that wonderful experiences are found.  Don&#39;t overlook the burbs.  If you can dig the food porn that Jelly Cafe is putting out, it&#39;s worth the try."

She ordered the Mexican skillet (which we had before) and barely touched it. It was very watered down and comparable to soup. When I stopped our server to inform her of the non edible plate and explained that it was barely touched she said she would have the manager remove it from our bill. I asked my partner if she would like something else and she said no because she was eating her cinnamon role instead. The server came back with a revised check that was only 15% off and said the manager would only allow for that. We paid the bill and left very unhappy. This was the first &#34;nice&#34; restaurant I have been to that disregarded our complaint and decided to make us pay for half the plate when only a few bites were taken. The manager did not come to our table to apologize or talk with us either. It&#39;s needless to say, we won&#39;t be back."

So, was it a perfect visit - no.  We had to wait a long time for a server since I gather we were not assigned one when we sat down.  My daughter ordered a crab benedict which came out as something completely different and we had to wait for them to make her the original order.

The beignet are heavenly. Perfectly fried and covered in cinnamon sugar.. and you dip 
it in this homemade fruit sauce they call jelly (its not as gelatinous as the jellies I am used to).. I felt a small moment of fireworks in my mouth when I ate these pillows of cinnamon sugar dough. They were AWESOME! 

So I get excited for my main breakfast meal when my Jelly Cheesecake French Toast arrived. I took a bite and to my despair, I was a little disappointed. They were wet and soggy. It maybe the type of bread, it was thin and flimsy. I saw the cream cheese but it was overpowered by the jelly that you could not really taste it.  When I ate the The Works Skillet, first thing that pop in my head was the Papa John&#39;s The Works Pizza. It tasted just like it. 

I will definitely be back even if it&#39;s just for the beignet because they are just that good and worth coming back for."

I recommend the mexican skillet, high quality chorizo and a whole avocado."

Jelly Cafe is proof that the American diner concept doesn&#39;t have to be boring, bland, or tasteless. Why? Because Jelly Cafe is none of those things.

It&#39;s super-cute, from the outside to the inside. Nice little wrought-iron bistro tables and chairs sit outside -- and they&#39;re both big enough and spaced well enough that you&#39;d feel totally comfortable sitting out there on a nice day. It&#39;s relaxing and inviting, with some nice hanging baskets of flowers keeping the area pretty and homey. 

Then you go inside. The decorations are modern without being uncomfortably so. It&#39;s not hipstery; it&#39;s homey and comforting, but it&#39;s also not your sainted great grandmother&#39;s sitting room with floral wallpaper and plastic covers on all the furniture. Super nice. 

The tables are nice, but the high-backed booths are even nicer. They do a great job of keeping your conversation within your area, and keeping other peoples&#39; conversations outside. Very nice. 

The food! Most of the Yelpers who have reviewed this place have mentioned the beignet &amp; jelly side as a must. As my SO says, &#34;if it&#39;s in the name of the place, you pretty much have to try it.&#34; We did. 

Four of the most beautiful freshly-made, cinnamon-sugar dusted beignets you could ever want to see came out with a little dish of their homemade fruit sauce...er, &#34;jelly.&#34; I don&#39;t say &#34;jelly&#34; mockingly; it&#39;s just not set the way most jellies are, but that&#39;s a good thing in this case. Picture the most delicious jelly doughnut you&#39;ve ever had. This is better. I guarantee you this is better. That is, unless your mom or grandma made that doughnut in your mind, in which case I&#39;m a liar. (Of course your mom&#39;s and/or grandma&#39;s is better! But this is a close second!)

We came in around 11am on a Thursday morning, so it&#39;s prime brunch time. I&#39;m the kind of girl who could easily eat breakfast for any meal of the day. My SO went with the portabella and steak panini with a side of pasta salad, and I went with the croque madame. We also each had a fresh fruit smoothie: he had strawberry/pineapple, while I had strawberry/mango. 

The smoothies were delicious, and exactly as advertised. Definitely hit the spot for a smoothie craving. The croque madame at Jelly puts a slight spin on the traditional croque madame. Instead of just being the fanciest, nicest grilled ham and cheese you&#39;ll ever eat (I say it&#39;s the gruyere that does it), Jelly takes away the Mornay sauce and makes it with french toast instead. So even though you have the fried egg on top, it&#39;s still marginally less messy. (I still didn&#39;t pick it up and eat it with my hands, though.) 

The breakfast potatoes that come with the croque madame are very tasty. The croque madame itself isn&#39;t crunchy at all (which, well, &#34;croque&#34; does mean &#34;crunchy,&#34; but I&#39;m not complaining because it&#39;s really tasty), but crucially, some of the potatoes *are*. I love crispy, well-seasoned breakfast potatoes. I also noticed that you can order traditional hash browns as a side, if your breakfast palate isn&#39;t satisfied by mere breakfast potatoes. Most places only have either/or, so that&#39;s really nice of Jelly to do.

My SO&#39;s portabella and steak panini was HUGE. He&#39;s a boy who can throw down on a much bigger amount of food than I can, and even he said it was huge! The pasta salad was very tasty, with a nice vinegary kick to it. The horseradish sauce served with the panini was creamy and smooth and flavorful, and suited the sandwich beautifully. (It wasn&#39;t bad on my breakfast potatoes, either.) 

All in all, definitely a good experience. We&#39;ll be back, and we&#39;d probably recommend it to everyone we know. We saw some of the coffeepots on tables that Candice G and others have mentioned, which is awesome if you&#39;re a coffee drinker. I also appreciate that you can do a half-sandwich, cup of soup lunch special if you want. My kind of lunch special (when I&#39;m not feeling brunchy)!"

Jelly Cafe got put to the test today on a Sunday brunch at 10:30, which could only be worse if it was 12:00. They really hustle there, but our food still came out pretty slow BUT when I have my own carafe of coffee, I&#39;m happy.

Don&#39;t let anybody tell you it isn&#39;t really LOUD in there, and Jelly Cafe is very kid friendly which is fine for those of us who enjoy other people&#39;s kids, but it definitely adds to the volume. Our food looked good too, I specifically wanted to try the cornedbeefhashbrowns and I liked it. My partner&#39;s bacon and fig omelette with melted provolone was fantastic even if a little overdone and the coffee was good. 
They seemed pretty flexible letting me choose a fruit cup over MORE toast or pancakes and I appreciated it. Interesting menu and we saw several other choices we would like to try, and that is NOT our usual experience in most breakfast oriented restaurants.

This would likely be a much more mellow place during the week and there are also coupons online, but we&#39;ll be back even on a Sunday."

The Great
The service was excellent! We got there soon after opening, and I was praying that  the food would not take forever. It didn&#39;t, and our server (Alexa) was awesome for suggesting the $5 Jumbo Long Islands (choose your flavor too) while we !

The Good (chili)
The brisket chili had the perfect blend of spices, and the cornbread was tremendous!

The So-So (crab boil)
I&#39;m a southern woman, so I have high expectations for flavor. The  crab boil was a bit mild for my taste, but Alexa helped me out with some add-on seasoning. In the future, I would hope they let seasoning really &#34;set&#34; before serving."

My wife and I decided that on my birthday we would go celebrate and eat there together.
We showed up at 6PM and stood at the host booth atleast 5 mins where up to 8 people gathered behind us. After we were finally seated, we sat and looked at the menu. For the next 15-20 mins, we didn&#39;t have one employee come up to us. No water or beverage order taken. I sat there and heard orders around us being taken, desserts offered, checks given and taken. People who were in line after us were having their orders taken. By this time it was 6:30PM and my wife and I decided we should just leave since we wouldn&#39;t be happy even if we eventually ordered."

Enjoyed the vibe there and they only turned the TV volume on during the highlights and we celebrated their victory with the live act.  Very cool.  The food was good and plentiful.  I guess you just expect places like this to serve portions that only a 400 lb person would find spot on but I understand that is the nature of this type of offering. . 

I had the ribs and the chicken combo (which were served prior with bread that was soaked in garlic butter).  (Maybe carry some Tic Tacs if you are on a date.. but then again, why are you going here on your date.. )  The ribs were great and I&#39;d order again, but the chicken could have been a bit more seasoned.  Everyone else had the pulled pork dinner and they raved so that would definitely be an option.  The drink menu was standard (but they had a few cool looking drink offerings but we drank prior so no chance to sample anything beyond beer.. this menu was perfectly fine if we were in the mood for some cocktails.   

Service with a smile.  Would come again if we venture out that way again."

The &#34;Pick 2&#34; and &#34;Pick 3&#34; options allowed us to sample several specialties.  Meals begin with a basket of warm, crusty rolls anointed with melted butter.  Our group gave unanimous thumbs-up to the smoky BBQ chicken, ribs, fried chicken, snow crab legs, shrimp, tender brisket, and lobsta roll.  Generous sides were good to excellent.  Our enthusiastic server was quick to deliver, answer questions, and offer suggestions.

And the decor:  Just another rustic sports bar with jumbo TV screens and a party atmosphere?   Actually it&#39;s very well done, several notches above most BBQ joints.

I had a rack of ribs from this place at the Schaumburg Septemberfest and I was very pleased. The rib meat was excellent, the sauce was excellent, and they were cooked to near perfection. They were a little on the small side, but I will attribute that to fair food. I hope to get into this place soon and have the full effect."

I had the chicken and waffles and my wife had a combo plate so that we could sample different items.  The BAM BAM shrimp appetizer was 1/2 price so I started off with that.  We were there early on a weekday afternoon so it was pretty quite.  They were playing some great blues music throughout the restaurant. The shrimp was amazing. Dressing not to spicy and served on a bed of cabbage slaw. 

It was the first time I had eaten chicken and waffles so I wasn&#39;t sure how to eat it.  It comes with an amazing jalapeno jam, honey butter and a country gravy that I could have eaten with a spoon! The chicken was breaded and fairly large.  I wasn&#39;t aware that there were still bones in it which made it a bit difficult to eat while trying to cut into the waffles.   

The ribs were really good but on the short side (Only like 3-4&#34;). They had just the right enough pull to them. Not fall off the bone but not tough at all. Very well done.  The pulled pork was ok. Not exceptional in any respect.  The brisket fell far short of my expectations.  Thinly sliced.  Fairly salty. Not much smoked flavor.  Didn&#39;t even look appealing for a piece of meat that had been smoked for hours.

Service was friendly and polite.

All in all I hope to return to explore the menu a bit more."

Not many patrons when we went (10AM) and the service was attentive.  The brunch menu has a combination of traditional breakfast dishes along with BBQ options.  I had a skillet that had potatoes, cheese, roasted pablano peppers, brisket and a couple of eggs.  It was the best skillet I ever had.

Midway through, we were brought biscuits and gravy to try.  The biscuits were made fresh and were fluffy.  The gravy was perfect and had a hint of smokiness.  Best I&#39;ve had.

I wait 10 minutes and try it again, same thing, no answer from 1 or 0.

The coconut onion rings were really big and coating was a bit over cooked which made it as hard as a rock in spots. They should make them smaller.

Had the gravy been smoothering the chicken like it should have I wouldn&#39;t have been able to eat any of the meal.  The gravy was hands down the worst I have ever eaten.  My wife ordered the chicken wrap and she struggled to choke half of it down before giving up on it.  Our server barely attended to our table.

I was singing like Neil Diamond by the end of the night. If you watch the Yelp video I posted you will hear my singing talents as I belt out, &#34;Bop Bop Bop!&#34; &amp; &#34;So Good. So Good!&#34; Look out American Idol &amp; The Voice I&#39;m coming for you next. Yelpers start voting on my video now. Actually Friday nights are a lot of fun here. They have the &#34;Live Pete Show&#34; &amp; he plays music from 5pm to 10:30pm. The guy is magical &amp; smooth when he sings. I felt like I was listening to the coolest CD ever. Pete is a performer from his ultra cool jacket to the old time microphone. I could listen to this guy sing all night. In fact, we ended having a three hour fantastic dinner. 

When you walk in, you will notice all of the cool antique memorabilia on the walls. My favorite item was the giant neon Blatz beer sign hanging in the middle of the room. I want this in my house. This place has such a fantastic feel inside plus they had great holiday decorations. I loved how the restaurant was like a giant loft with the bar in the dinning room. It just added to the fun atmosphere.  Everyone in the restaurant could hear Live Pete playing music but it wasn&#39;t very loud, so we could still enjoy having a great dinner conversation without yelling across the table. 

When we sat at our table I notice that the  chairs were incredibly comfortable. It had taken us an hour from downtown Chicago to get here and when we sat in our seats it was so enjoyable. I didn&#39;t mind sitting down again. 

We started out with some cocktails. I ordered the hand crafted blackberry bourbon smash which was fantastic. I loved how the drink wasn&#39;t overly sweet and it was a great way to start my evening. We also ordered the Maryland lump crab cake &amp; I will tell you it was one of the best crab cakes I&#39;ve had in Chicago. It stands up above all of the fancy downtown joints. In fact, I liked this one the best cause it had a little spice to it. The chef hit it out of the park with this amazing opening dish. If I walked away now, I would be a happy man. There was also a side of coleslaw which was delicious with a nice spice to it. My little one started out with the clam chowder and it was phenomenal. I love that she is such a foodie. 

I was in need of a second cocktail when I decided to go with the Ginger Crush. I was in love with this drink &amp; I would be enjoying it for the rest of the night. When I find a drink I love why would I choose anything else. This cocktail is very similar to a Moscow mule but made with tequila, fresh lemon, mint &amp; ginger. This is my summer drink! I can&#39;t wait to come back here when it&#39;s warmer &amp; drink this on the great outdoor patio. 

I loved the kids menu. We typically do not order off of it but my little one saw Filet Mignon on there &amp; she had to have it. I feel sorry for her boyfriend cause she&#39;s not going to be a fast food date. I was really impressed with the steak. It came with two petite pieces and ranch fries. They even cooked it perfectly for a child. It was done medium &amp; not dried out. The chef knew the timing on cooking the steak &amp; I was happy cutting it up for her. My little one also jumped into the garlic butter bread rolls. We got three for the table but for some reason I only got one bite. My little one loves bread. These rolls reminded me of the addictive buns you get at Bob Chinn&#39;s. I wish I would have asked for another basket cause they were very good. 

For our entrees I went with the Shrimp Creole which was delish. I loved all of the spices. I could have used some of that bread to soak up the yummy sauce. The sauce was made with butter, beer &amp; Cajun spices. I wish I had a shot glass of it to toast the table. The entree came with a choice of two sides &amp; I went with the Mac N Cheese &amp; the chili. The Mac N Cheese was creamy &amp; yummy. I wished I had more. My side was a tease &amp; I&#39;m going to need to come back here for a full bowl. I was really impressed with the deep red chili with chunks of beef brisket. Again I can not wait to come back here for a giant bowl of this. 

My wife decided to go with the fish of the day. It was a grouper with a white wine sauce, fresh tomato, avocado over green &amp; white asparagus &amp; a fantastic polenta. My wife doesn&#39;t like polenta &amp; she dived in. I&#39;m a huge polenta fan &amp; I couldn&#39;t stop stealing it off her plate. She had three giant pieces &amp; I was able to steal about 2.4 of it. I&#39;m lucky she didn&#39;t poke me with her butter knife. I really loved her fish &amp; the sauce worked great on it. I wish that this dish was always on the menu cause it was a winner &amp; I would drive out here for it. 

We were almost ready to throw in the towel when we had a family discussion for dessert. My wife and I were voting for key lime pie &amp; our little one was voting for fresh hot maple bacon donuts.

Pork used for the sliders was dry they load the sandwich with slaw to mask it. Thumbs down on the beans also pretty much ho hum. The crab cakes were just ok, sorry they should be outstanding when it&#39;s used in your name, &#34;sorry maybe that&#39;s just me&#34;! Everything is over salted my guess is to drive you to the bar.

On a good note the Mac was pretty good as were the rolls in garlic oil along with the service received.

To wrap this one up...bit pricy for the overall quality of what I tried. I might be fun for a night out drinking and snacking."

 I had the pulled pork dinner, the other people in my party had the chicken and waffles, the creole shrimp and the snow crab legs with ribs. We also ordered the calamari for an appetizer and 2 alcoholic drinks. Only 2 of the meals didn&#39;t have any issues.

The appetizer was slow to arrive and not a good portion size for the price. 

Getting the alcoholic drinks took more than necessary. At one point our server said that the bartender was taking his time with them. They were good so it was fine in the end. 

The creole shrimp was cold, even to the point where the sauce was congealing a bit. The portion size for this dinner wasn&#39;t good. I would expect there to be more shrimp on the plate since it&#39;s cheaper than the other seafood offered.

The Snow crab legs with ribs were alright but again for the price not really worth it. Our server said the ribs weren&#39;t ready and had to come back for them and the soup that my friend ordered came without a spoon. 

The chicken and waffles were good and didn&#39;t have any issues and even the server recommended it readily. 

The pulled pork was alright I had better. It wasn&#39;t as moist as other places. 

The service was slow even once it slowed down. When we came in it was busy so we expected a wait but by the time we received our appetizers and drinks a good portion of the inside seating was gone. A table who was seated 5-10 minutes after us had their food first and once they got there&#39;s we had to wait about 15 minutes for ours. We would understand that if a certain dish took longer to cook but we expected our food to come out in the usual amount of time(and the expected amount of time for a Saturday night) without someone&#39;s dinner being cold.

All in all I wouldn&#39;t come back here. If the food was better than average then it would be a yes but it&#39;s a skip for me. At least they had plenty of t.v&#39;s and a live band to help pass the time.

Update with new information. Two people in my group had the lobster bisque soup and now they have diarrhea."

But Sweet Caroline&#39;s passed with flying colors!

We did not order any seafood, just brisket, pulled pork and ribs. Our sides were BBQ beans, Mac and cheese and corn bread. The amount of smoke was just right, you tasted it but it was not bitter. The meat was a touch over cooked if you were in competition but it was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The ribs were very small, like a Danish cut. The bones were maybe 2.5 -3 inches long; but great taste. The dinner came with tasty rolls and Texas Toast. 

Our sides were delicious! I&#39;d drive an hour for the corn bread alone! It comes freshly baked in a skillet with maple butter.  The beans were mild with a touch of smoke. The Mac and cheese was creamy and sooooo good! 

The atmosphere is a cross of Joe&#39;s Crab Shack and Famous Dave&#39;s. There is live entertainment on weekends."

I got a shrimp po boy and some cheesy grits I could share with the kids.  Kids got a waffle with strawberry sauce and sausage patties.  Husband went for the ribs with sweet potatoes.  The sandwich was delicious (get the spicy keeper sauce on the side) and the girls ate everything on their plates as well as a lot of the grits.  Great service and all of this was under $50!

We all loved the food and the BBQ was very tasty. I did the combo platter and the smashed sweet potatoes and was very pleased. Everyone enjoyed their selections and sides.  We also ended up ordering two orders of the fried pickles - they are some of the best we have had in a very long time... Those vanished quickly from the table :)

They had a large party at some high top tables by the bar. Even with that group of people we still had plenty of attention from the wait staff. 

I would go back again and recommend you give them a try. I wish they had a booth set up vs. all tables. 

PS love that the BBQ is in bottles on the tables so you can do the taste test first.... Also saw some gambling machines on they way out so maybe you will win enough to come back a second night :)

I went to finally try out this place since it&#39;s one of the newest in town and there aren&#39;t many unique seafood/BBQ spots in the area. 

Here are the pros: 
* Food
* Portions
* Food Options
* Location
* Parking

The food is amazing and Fresh! All the BBQ&#39;d meats are placed on a slow cooker/roaster for about 14 hours so the meat has amazing flavor no matter what meat option you choose. 

You also get to use 3 different types of BBQ sauce to perfect your flavor experience to your liking. 

You also get treated to complimentary garlic rolls. These are amazing! They a baked at the restaurant and pretty much made to order. So the bread is soft and flavorful! You may feel questionable about the quantity they give (1 roll per guest) but trust me you&#39;ll be fine. 

When it comes to the actual dinner. The portions are really good and very fair for the price you pay. I went with the &#34;Pick 2&#34; option and I picked the pulled pork (cooked great and so tender) and half rack of ribs (Ribs were also tender and flavorful) I had more then enough to take home and the price was very decent. 

Save room for desert! You have to try the Bacon Maple Donuts! Holy $hit! So good! You get donuts and bacon and it&#39;s also dessert! What&#39;s not to like? 

Cons: 
* Wait times during the Weekend
* Queuing System

If you plan of going FRI, SAT, or SUN. It will benefit you if you reserve a spot ahead of time. The wait time was longer then quoted at the host table and they seem to give shorter wait times to parties of 4 or more VS parties of 2.  As we were seated (party of 2) after groups of 4 who checked in after us. 

The queuing system seems to need some work. Either the system they use or the users who are using it. 

All reservations are made with an app service called &#34;NOWAITAPP&#34; which prompts you for a phone number to book your reservation. Which in turn you get an SMS confirmation and another SMS notification when your table is ready. 

We didn&#39;t seem to get the notification that our table was ready so we are assuming the hosts were having issues with the check in system and when manual to some degree. 

Will I got back? Sure! Just during a time where it&#39;s not too busy."

Kathy had a lobster roll and Tim had Cajun shrimp.

The food was excellent and the drinks were great.

We were lucky to have a reservation since the place was packed and it was a 40 minute wait.

Bands play on Saturday and Friday nights.  It was so crowded and noisy that you could barely hear them.

I would recommend this restaurant but on the weekend make sure you have a reservation."

And you can&#39;t beat their Wednesday special of 1/2 a BBQ Chicken &amp; 1/2 a Slab of Ribs for $11.99! That meal comes with their &#34;ranch fries&#34; &amp; some buttery garlic rolls.  We all took our chicken home to have another meal (or two!) from.  The BBQ ribs were very tender &amp; come with a BBQ rub on them &amp; then you can add sauce from their 3 different sauce options if you&#39;d like.  My only disappointment was they don&#39;t allow any substitutions on that meal special - I wanted to try their succotash instead of the &#34;ranch fries&#34; but, oh well.  The &#34;ranch fries&#34; were crispy &amp; delicious so I was still a happy camper in the end.

The service was pretty quick &amp; everyone was nice. When we left every employee we passed from the bussers, other servers &amp; manager wished us a good evening."

What kept me hooked though was checking out the menu.   Almost every item listed peaked my interest.   I decided to order carryout from there.

I was torn between several items.   Fire-roasted Crab &amp; Shrimp Artichokes or Smoked Chicken?   Crab Cakes or Spicy Grilled Jerk Shrimp?  Traditional Lobsta Roll or The King Crab &#39;N Que?    So many enticing choices...such a limited appetite.   What&#39;s a poor sap like me to do?

In the end I ordered the Smoked Chicken, Lobsta Roll, and some ginger beer to wash it all down.    All of their carryout orders are picked up at Moretti&#39;s Ristorante &amp; PIzzeria&#39;s Carryout section.    I went inside Sweet Caroline&#39;s Crab-N-QUE by mistake and the hostess was friendly enough to direct me to Moretti&#39;s.   The restaurant itself looked packed so business clearly is doing well.

The staff at Morettis&#39; were friendly as well when going to pick up my order.

The ginger beer I thought was a little tiny for the price but the drink was good.   I was overall happy with the food.  I especially loved the smoked chicken wings.   I want to definitely try the King Crab &#39;N Que next since the name was part of the appeal that drew me to the restaurant in the first place."

So, interesting fact, this plaza is about to be dominated by the Moretti&#39;s owner, like a one-sided game of Risk. Steak &amp; Shake is like a super fortified Australia, so no one&#39;s going to be attacking them anytime soon, but Macaroni Grill is like little ol&#39; Europe, that&#39;s about to get hit from all sides! Shame, because I like Macaroni Grill. And yes, this Moretti&#39;s owner is the same owner of Snuggery. Sweet Caroline&#39;s is a new concept from Moretti&#39;s. This used to be the old Lone Star, and it&#39;s been vacant forever. One random day, I went to Steak &amp; Shake for dessert with some friends, and there&#39;s this new shiny sign, and more importantly, a really interesting concept! 

&#34;Crab N Que.&#34; Sounds like Seafood BBQ Fusion! I&#39;ve never had smoked or grilled crab/seafood. I wonder if that&#39;ll even be good? So, a couple weeks after their grand opening, I finally got the chance to go here...

BABY BACK RIBS
Ribs were moist enough, but not as good as they could be. Good char, good smoke flavor, and mixing the Hot &amp; KC BBQ sauce on this was pretty good. I haven&#39;t had Champps&#39;s ribs in a long time, but they were my favorite ribs in Chicago, although that isn&#39;t saying much. Chicago&#39;s BBQ scene is pretty grim, and even though Champp&#39;s was no Kansas City, it was consistently pretty decent. Well, Champps is gone now, so it may be a toss up between these and Chili&#39;s ribs (which I haven&#39;t had in probably 7 years or so).

PULLED PORK
Nope. Not quite Sahara desert dry, but maybe California drought dry. Didn&#39;t have any real good pork flavor either. However, it was edible, and that means I could put BBQ sauces on them and eat them! If you like pulled pork, no need to disappoint yourself here.

BEEF BRISKET
Definitely smokey, but also pretty dry. The sauce makes it edible, but still not great. Not worth it.

SMOKED CHICKEN
Again, dry, but not as dry as the pulled pork or brisket. This one actually can taste decent with the BBQ sauce. Nothing special though. I&#39;d rather have the BBQ sauces here with Boston Market chicken...or hell...Costco rotisserie chicken.

FRIED OYSTERS
I&#39;m more of a raw oyster fan, but this wasn&#39;t too bad. For something that was just deep fried, though, it came out a little lukewarm. You get cocktail sauce and a cherry pepper tartar sauce, which was really good. That tartar sauce had a small kick to it that was very welcome too, and I found myself using that sauce for other things, like the cornbread and chips!

KICKIN CREOLE SHRIMP
Again, came out lukewarm. Jumbo shrimp with a lot of cajun spices and garlic. This was pretty decent, but the lukewarmness was killing it. Also, I could taste the creole, I could taste the garlic, but this &#34;creole butter&#34; was nowhere to be found. The flavor I was most hoping to see was butter, but oh well. And if you&#39;re wondering, NO, this is not Boiling Crab. You get like 6-8 pieces of shrimp on a plate with sauce.

CRAB LEGS
Not bad. I love crab legs, and other than being warm, these were just par for the course.

CRAP/SHRIMP/ARTICHOKE DIP
Again, came out lukewarm. It was pretty cheesy, and sure, it contained all 3 ingredients in there, but something about it was just not exciting at all. After my first chip, I was bored of it. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it wasn&#39;t bad, but nothing really popped out. Flavors weren&#39;t really complimenting eachother, and sort of fused into something blah. The whole was somehow less that the sum of the parts.

SKILLET CORNBREAD
For something served on a small iron skillet, this was also lukewarm. You&#39;d expect, &#34;don&#39;t touch the skillet, it&#39;s hot!&#34; but nope, lukewarm. This is just cornbread, but it does have a light jalapeno spice baked in. Didn&#39;t really help for me.


BORE-N-QUE
I honestly wanted to give this place 2 stars, but the points just didn&#39;t add up that way. A place that&#39;s named &#34;Crab-N-Que&#34; is dying to have some kind of fusion between seafood and bbq, but there is NOTHING of the sort here! In fact, they don&#39;t even have combinations that include both BBQ and seafood! Not only do they have an identity crisis on their menu, their restaurant layout is also just as ambiguous. The bar is huge, and is the centerpiece of the place. It&#39;s too much restaurant to be labeled a bar, but it&#39;s also too much bar to be labeled a restaurant. It&#39;s basically like an Applebee&#39;s, but with a bigger bar.

Bottom line, I don&#39;t have any desire to come back. If I was with a group that wanted to go, I wouldn&#39;t start a fight, but I probably would suggest a different place."

It&#39;s hard to tell if it&#39;s due to it being opening night or if they&#39;re going to be like this all the time.  First off, the server seemed like he was still trying to figure out how and what to prioritize, which is understandable in a new environment.  I ordered a drink when he first came around and didn&#39;t receive it until after we ordered our food 10 minutes later.  
We ordered the mussels and the cajun shrimp.  The food wasn&#39;t too bad, but there was nothing special about it at all.  The shrimp came in a plate of juices that was just too thin to coat the shrimp, which made the shrimp taste like...just shrimp.  The mussels were a bit better, but there was still room for improvement in the flavor department.  
All in all, the place was alright, the service was still trying to figure things out, and the food was nothing special.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d come back for the food, but I might try sitting at the bar one of these days."

I had the half smoked chicken which I was able to take home with brown rice and coleslaw. We shared appetizers of calamari, smoked chicken wings, crab and shrimp artichoke dip. among those three, the calamari and artichoke dip are something that I would come back for.
Ribs are off the bone, pulled pork dinner was substantial. We had leftovers so the servings are enough.
Will come back and try other fares from the menu.  
Saw a sign for where the restrooms are and it states.... Sanitary Rest Rooms, good to know! It was though...."

Deal breaker was our server, Hope. We paid and just waiting for our friend from the restroom. Hope started cleaning up and then she said &#34;I apologized if my service was bad tonight.&#34; And of course we said no, she was great. And she replied &#34;well you guys didn&#39;t leave a tip sooo&#34; and then left. Our friend paid using a card. And we were going to leave cash for tip. The thing is when she complained about the tip, we were still at the table having a conversation and finishing our drinks. So greedy and impatient. Let me ask this, (tip or not) are you guys only giving a good service in the hope of getting a tip and not because it&#39;s part of your job??

We were so shocked. She embarrassed us. Good job Hope! Way to ruin our time.

Not ever coming back and will not recommend this place to anyone!"

I did not try the seafood here. Ordered the 3 BBQ platter that consisted of dry rub ribs, 1/4 chicken and sausage. The ribs were nice and tender and I enjoyed dipping them in the hot and spicy BBQ sauce. The sauce had nice heat. Chicken was juicy and the sausage had a nice spicy flavor.

For sides had the spicy caesar salad and mac and cheese. The salad did have a kick to it and the lettuce was nice and crisp. Dressing was basic caesar taste. The mac and cheese was just ok. It was noodles in a cheese sauce. It was not baked with bread crumbs or came in a hot pan.

Also ordered some loaded fries. The fries were wedges that were quite crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside. toppings were good.

Atmosphere was nice although the music was played very loud. Inside they had live music which was great but my group wanted to be able to hear ourselves talk. We ended up sitting outside but the speakers were still blaring the music from the inside.

Service was excellent. Our waitress got us refills in a timely manner and bought us everything that we needed."

The shrimp were large, plentiful, and properly cooked, and came in a tasty sauce, with a choice of 2 sides, which also were good. The double burger with one side was good. The menu is a strange combo of seafood and western BBQ. Caroline&#39;s features a long list of draft beers.

The place is very very busy and noisy. There are 20 video screens with different programs running. The decor and the menu are a blaze of different images, colors, shapes. Items of decor hanging all over include fishing/crabbing implements and western items in a random mix. Entertainment 3 days/week is 50&#39;s, some blues, country or folk. Not exactly the place for a quiet dinner.

Service is friendly and capable. There is plenty of help. They have outdoor service as well."

They will text you when it is ready so you don&#39; have to hang out.

Our waiter was nice but a tad slow. It took awhile to place our order, maybe 25 mins or so. We found it funny that the decor consisted mostly of Coke signs but they served Pepsi. the menu said serves full line of Pepsi products, this is a lie. No Mountain Dew :( Over all food was pretty good. I had pulled pork and mussels.

After reading all prior reviews, we were not sure what to expect. Service was great and food was really good. We got here on Wednesday night before thanksgiving. Ordered crab cakes as an appetizer - it tasted really good, had big chunks of crab, tasty sauce and slaw. Ordered corn bread- very ver good: moist, with a little sweetness and jalapeños flavor, don&#39;t forget the butter!!!  We had a group of 6, most people ordered lobster bisque soup and really liked it. As a main dish, we had ribs, shrimps, and fish of the day - walleye. Everyone enjoyed their dish. Drinks and desserts were good too: tried doughnuts, peach cobbler and hot fudge Sunday. Everyone had a good time. It was a little loud, but we all could easily talk. 
We gave 4 starts, because we expected a little more mix of sea food and bbq, with a little more flavor."

Gave good advise on the crab artichoke dip, but they served it with about 12 tortilla chips???  We ordered what we had our tasters set for and the only one that liked the food was the person that ordered one of the waiters suggestions.  I had the Thursday night crab special - glad I didn&#39;t pay full price.  That would have been bad.

Someone ordered a burger - overcooked.
Shrimp Po&#39;boy - good.
Brisket did not go over big and was not eaten.

Succotash was a hit.  Sweet potato casserole - Meh...

2 out of 4 of us might go back, 2 would go next door instead...

Looks like it might be fun sometimes.  Decor and ambiance was pleasant and authentic(ish).

Not a lot of people given it was an early meal.  Started with the cornbread skillet and was provided a couple of rolls. The rolls were swimming in butter sauce with garlic. Overkill on the butter when it is dripping and running down into your hand. I had the brisket dinner which had a decent smokey flavor but it coated in an extremely salty rub. Couldn&#39;t eat more than a couple pieces. Husband had ribs which had good flavor. Sweet potato side was the best thing on his plate though. Bacon maple donut bites were decent but nothing special.

Service was okay. Waitress was friendly enough but couldn&#39;t remember to bring me a fork after the one i had fell. 

Overall I don&#39;t see any reason to return. Nothing stood out as worth spending that much."

Great ambience, excellent beer selection, and sauce on the table. Loved the vinegar sauce on the pulled pork.

The only bummer was the brisket; it was dry when we got it.

We were back in the day, but after a while, we decided we would rather be comfortable at home. Yesterday, my office closed early which was a treat, but NYE had kinda just shown up this year and we weren&#39;t prepared with plans of any sort. I&#39;ve been wanting to try Sweet Caroline&#39;s from the moment I heard about them. We took the early, non-crowded opportunity and ran with it. 

The first thing we noticed was the large bar. It&#39;s huge and takes up a lot of the restaurant. There are TVs all over the place, so it&#39;s hard to miss the game here. The designers must have taken quite a while to pull together all of the interesting decor. You could look at this for a long time without getting bored. 

Our server was sweet, but she wasn&#39;t overly excited to be there. We noticed that the table next to us who were seated after us, had bread immediately with their drinks and their server was practically Prince Charming. Our bread came out ten minutes after theirs. I wish our meal had been spaced out better. We were there around 3:45pm...long before the rush.  

I wanted the crab cakes and the hubby wanted the chili to start. The crab cakes were actually a crab cake. It was a very good crab cake and the remoulade sauce was tasty. It was an $11 appetizer and I&#39;m not sure that I felt it should have been an $11 appetizer in the suburbs. Don&#39;t laugh at me because I know this will sound ridiculous, but if they had taken the same amount of crab cakes mixture and made it into two cakes, I may have felt like I had gotten my money&#39;s worth on that one. Just my two cents. I told you it sounded crazy... The husband&#39;s chili was good, but not what he expected. It was more like a soup with a lot of beans and some chunks of meat. He likes beans, but said it was too many beans for him. 

I went with a NYE special with filet mignon and two crab stuffed prawns. I subbed out the rice and veggies for herb roasted potatoes. He chose a two meat combo with ribs and beef brisket, baked beans and ranch fries. The filet was perfectly cooked, seasoned appropriately and so tender!  The prawns were dressed in a nice buttery sauce, but the cornbread/sausage/crab stuffing was minimal. My potatoes were very good. The filet was definitely the highlight for me. My husband was annoyed by the presentation. His dinner came on a metal tray which was fine, but the beans were in a separate container on the tray (and it wasn&#39;t full...choose a different serving dish if you&#39;re only going to fill it halfway please) and the brisket was on another plate sorta thing on the tray. They had poured meat juices over the brisket, so you couldn&#39;t transfer the ribs to the plate or the brisket to the tray without making a mess. He used his appetizer plate to try the three sauces that were all too similar to appreciate the differences. They weren&#39;t bad...they just weren&#39;t distinctly different. 

While it wasn&#39;t the perfect meal, it was good and we would like to go back on a random regular night to see how that goes."

We went for dinner on Saturday night. They are not on OpenTable nor do they have an online reservations system but I called was able to make a reservation for 8. We arrived about 15 minutes early and the lovely hostess (Katie) advised us that they were running about 30 mins behind.  No problem. We found space at the bar and ordered a drink.   My bf had the blackberry bourbon smash and really enjoyed it. I simply had water at the bar. After approximately 30 mins we checked back in with the hostess, still no table.  The restaurant has maybe a dozen various sized high top tables surrounding the bar and then maybe two dozen low tops between the bar and the stage. A large cluster of those are close together and right in front of the stage and it was very loud. We opted to wait for a better spot.
Once we were finally seated, our server  (Maria) greeted us with a smile and an apology. She was delightful. Before we could order, she informed us that they were out of ribs. What!!?? How is a BBQ joint out of ribs. That was the sole reason I went there. I openly pouted. 
We ordered the skillet cornbread - just ok. The fried oysters - AMAZING!  Perfectly coated,  seasoned and fried.. just yum 
We also got the shrimp appetizer (can&#39;t remember what it was called ) but it was basically sautéed shrimp in a shooter with a spicy corn relish. It was really good. 
For my entree, I got the pick 2 with brisket and pulled pork. Just ok. The baked beans were great.  The mac and cheese was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. Worse than Kraft 
I also had a mai Tai.  It was,pretty good but keep the cheap plastic &#34;souvenir &#34; cup. 
My bf got 1lb king crab legs. They were big and meaty although not served as warm as he would&#39;ve liked. His mashed potatoes and Cole slaw were hits. 
We wanted to try the bacon donuts but couldn&#39;t force more food down. 
The manager did come by to greet us and we expressed our disappointment at the absence of ribs to which he replied that we may need to come earlier.  They cook the ribs 16 hours so cook for the day and when they run out, they run out. I understand but I don&#39;t understand.  
At any rate, the people there are awesome. The food has its highs and lows. They need to figure out how to plan better for food quantities and based on the fact that there is live music (that is pretty good ) they should expect people to diddle a bit which makes seating a challenge.  
Will I go back?  Yes,  I likely will and they better have some darn ribs!!"

Bar was clean and bartender observant. We were told 45 minute wait, got seated in 20. 
Ordered the nachos, while they were yummy, they came out kind of cold, so probably wouldn&#39;t order again. 
We both ordered the 2 meat platters. My husband got pork and sausage with ranch potatoes and baked beans. Yum. 
Pork was great. Sausage was ok. The beans were nice and tangy and we loved the potatoes. 
I got brisket and chicken with ranch potatoes and the succotash. The succotash was incredible! Brisket was some of the best I&#39;ve had. Chicken was nice and moist. 
Also got an order of the cornbread with maple butter..... Delicious.

I love the fact that I can get a great lobster roll and my husband, who is not very fond of seafood, can get some great bbq!
The coleslaw was a bit peppery, but VERY tasty.
I got the chicken wings appetizer which came dry rubbed so you could sauce them to your liking with one of their 3 bbq sauces on the table.

My only complaint is the wasted space of a stage. They had two people singing to tracks of music up on this huge stage.  It was LOUD.  If it was a band it would have been different but this to me was a glorified karaoke with the same two people singing over and over again.
They have a beautiful space which could easily entertain a band with space for a dance floor."

Everything was incredibly salty. Like really, really salty. Like drink a quart of water salty. This applied to the mac and cheese which was also globular in consistency, the chili which was just sort of chunks of fatty brisket in a soupy sauce, and, yes, even the coleslaw. Salty coleslaw, you say? Indeed I do say.

I had the &#34;pick two&#34; plate and I chose the beef and the pork. Other than salt, there were no other flavors that came through. The brisket did have some bark on it, but I assume that came pre-applied from the Sysco packing plant, because there was no smoke flavor, no smoke ring, no color to be found other than gray, and lots of fat. It was actually fairly tender, so I guess that is a plus. The pork was, again, very salty, and not at all a Carolina style BBQ. I was just recently in NC and had some great BBQ and was hoping this place would bring me back to my summer vacation. But no. I guess there was nothing else really bad about the pork, but they aren&#39;t even trying. They even serve their &#34;Carolina&#34; puled pork atop a piece of, yes, very salty, Texas toast sort of how they don&#39;t do in NC.

As for service: we did carry out, so can&#39;t comment on service per se. But they gave us no BBQ sauce, which actually is a thing in some Carolina BBQ places, but they did advertise each dish coming with their house BBQ sauce. And we ordered corn bread as well, but they left that off the order and we didn&#39;t realize till we got home. On the plus side , they didn&#39;t charge us for the corn bread.

I can&#39;t contemplate the circumstances under which I would visit again."

The thought of their food makes me crinkle up my nose and shake my head left to right, mumbling gross.  

The brisket was dry and cold with a lot of fat. Clams were nothing special, clam is a clam.  The cornbread was saturated in oil.  The sides are about the size of an old Dixie cup your mother would have in the guest bathroom. The side of Mac &amp; Cheese would have been pretty decent, but cold and when you stuck in your fork, the entire glob of macaroni in the cup came up.  The succotash was saturated in oil/butter and cold. 

We threw everything in the garbage.

Due to all the restaurants in Schaumburg, South Barrington and Hoffman Estates, I highly doubt we&#39;ll ever visit again."

That&#39;s Sweet Carolines. While the name gives you the impression that it&#39;s a restaurant, as soon as you walk in you find that the bar and pub tables take up over half the space. And the video gambling takes up another section. Given the history of the owners, (Fred Hoffman - Snuggery) it&#39;s not a surprise. Arrived about 6:30 on a Saturday (about a week after the grand opening) and the wait was 45 minutes. We found that some groups walked right in and got a table without waiting. The manager seemed to recognize each group so maybe that got them faster service. Our waiter arrived and apologized for the wait - &#34;It&#39;s crazy tonight&#34;. If a full restaurant is &#39;crazy&#39;, that&#39;s a problem. Maybe this was just the staff getting into a rhythm as part of the recent opening. We weren&#39;t offered drinks or any details about the listed specials. We just got the &#34;Are you ready to order?&#34; The music and crowd noise is very loud. And the obligatory Neil Diamond Sweet Caroline was turned up even louder (more bar clues). The families with small children looked a little out of place. The food was ok but kind of spotty. The brisket, while juicy, lacked any smoke flavor and showed no smoke ring. The pulled pork was pretty good but had too much fat for my taste. The sausage had a strange off taste. The cornbread was more cinnamon bread. The beans, however, were very tasty. The sauces on the table were also pretty good. So there were some hits. We noticed the dueling piano players setting up (another bar clue) but we left before they started. The decor is mostly old signs, cans, etc but gave it a good BBQ joint feel. When we left about 8:30 the bar was about half full and we saw no one waiting for a table.

I think this concept would work better in an entertainment area like Navy Pier, or around a hotel area like Rosemont, but this area only has other restaurants so it really doesn&#39;t seem to draw a bar crowd. This area has seen some big names fail like TGI Friday&#39;s, Lone Star, and Max and Erma&#39;s so if they don&#39;t concentrate on the restaurant operations they will have a hard time making it."

I had the Brisket Melt with a side of beans. My friend had the pulled pork sandwich. The Brisket was tender bit slightly overcooked. It had grilled onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. It was supposed to have Chipotle/Honey sauce but that was missing. However they have a variety of sauces on the table so was able to make do. The ranch fries were excellent and the beans were excellent. The beans have a variety of 5 different beans with big chunks pork and onions. Had a cocktail that was a VERY heavy pour and didn&#39;t taste very good. Overall the food is great but service was lacking."

Tried a little bit of everything. I&#39;m a picky eater. Started off with the steamed mussles, they were perfect and the broth was great for dipping. Then of course it being a BBQ place had to try the Brisket....it melts in your mouth and with the 3 different BBQ sauces made it even better but save room for the cornbread. The corn bread was fantastic with the maple butter, it totally complimented the Brisket. Ordered the Bacon Maple Glazed donuts for dessert....I highly recommend it...salty and sweet.... and they have my favorite burbon...BULLIET neat was the perfect ending to the meal.

After dinner went to the bar to have a few more drinks, Bartenders were very friendly and I like the fact they have Live entertainment and a Late night DJ.

I was so surprised by this place the first time I went. We tried a bunch of things and loved them all!!! We have come back a few times, even with other friends and they all loved what they had too. The music is always great and we usually hang around longer than other restaurants because we get so comfortable just enjoying the moment. My favorites are: brisket, ribs, Cajun shrimp, corn break skillet and key lime pie. I will definitely return!!!"

We ordered the BBQ Feast which serves four (but, it could actually serve five or maybe even six). The feast has four meats (brisket, chicken, ribs and pulled pork), potatoes, coleslaw, beans and cornbread. Had lots of leftovers to take home. The next day, my son took some for lunch and we actually still had enough meats for a few more meals at home. The meal overall was really good.

The three sauces they have are OK, nothing spectacular. I like a vinegary kind of sauce. Of their three, none of them were like that. In the end, they do the job.

OMG!!!! That skillet cornbread!!!! It is (for me), honestly the BEST cornbread I have ever had!! I&#39;m in love with that cornbread. Next time, we&#39;ll order two! LOL

The only thing I didn&#39;t care for is the cilantro in the coleslaw. Other than that, it&#39;s decent. An idea, they should give you a choice of with or without it. BLAH!!

The waiter was great and, the chef came out and talked to us (and even sat down). I asked about the cornbread and jokingly asked if they had any extra. Because it was my birthday, he gave me one to take home on the house (along with some of their honey &amp; maple butter). So nice!!

This place is a tad on the pricey side but overall, it&#39;s good! I will go back again. It&#39;s closer to me than Famous Dave&#39;s."

So on my Birthday today decided to check out Sweet Caroline&#39;s Crab-N-Que that was close to home.
I had the smoked BBQ quarter chicken with their ranch fries (which look like potatoes sliced like potato chips and baked) and their mayo spicy coleslaw with the complimentary garlic rolls. They also had the option of the vinegar based coleslaw. 
I also liked that on their table they had squeeze bottles of their Hot and Spicy BBQ sauce, Kansas City Sweet BBQ sauce and their Tangy BBQ sauce. I sampled the sweet BBQ sauce and tangy BBQ sauce and decided to go with the sweet BBQ sauce since it was more rich than the tangy BBQ sauce.
I&#39;m happy to say I walked away feeling very full and satisfied. Service was good, and the atmosphere looks like they&#39;re trying to model themselves after a Southern BBQ place. 
Keep in mind they currently don&#39;t do lunch service (they open at 3PM) probably because of their process of cooking their ribs (very slowly over hours) it&#39;s not practical to have a lunch service right now."

The slaw on the side was just as excellent. Service was impeccable and the manager was nice. The bad, the bbq tasted like it came out of the oven, it didn&#39;t have much smoke flavor so I was a little disappointed.

My wife ordered the lobster roll, it came out not in lobster chunks as the picture shows but in minced pieces that you couldn&#39;t tell if it was lobster or filler.   I ordered the brisket sandwich, and there was no way it was real brisket as it was sliced paper thin and looked and tasted like roast beef from a deli.

The servers were good and the live entertainment great. Unfortunately that&#39;s not why we came here. When you call yourself a &#34;Crab n Que&#34; your crabs and BBQ had better be good. Both were awful. The alligator bites were rubbery and they gave you such a small quantity it was ridiculous.  The Baby Back Ribs did not fall off the bone and the meat was not cooked well. I ordered the king crab legs for $22.00. Correction..it was a LEG. Only one 8 inch long leg and the knuckle.  I think they went to Jewel for the $9.99/LB special and just heated this thing up. It was not good.  The Creole Shrimp was also just a mess of butter sauce with maybe 5 or 6 tail on shrimp. Way overpriced. I can say that their special ingredient it SALT.  There isn&#39;t a chance in Hell I will return to this place. Its awful. I went with a group of 8 people and we all felt it was not good for the money.  Long John Silvers would serve you better.

We had brisket which was dry but swimming in a puddle of some kind of clear juice. The ribs were fatty and the sauce choices were either too sweet, too vinegary or too spicy. We also tried a shrimp po&#39; boy. The shrimp were cut in half lengthwise (I guess so they don&#39;t have to give as many) and it was doused in a very spicy sauce. I&#39;m not afraid of flavor, but not at the expense of overdoing it with heat. The drinks were so-so. Tasted like they were pre mixed and very easy on the alcohol.
The service was just ok. The wait staff seemed confused about table assignment. Once our server found us, she was efficient but didn&#39;t make any suggestions.
I might go back if I was in the area, but probably won&#39;t  go out of my way to go back."

We went again this past weekend because we had a taste for bbq and this time they had some drink specials which helped but the food was flavorless! Smoked chicken wings were ok but pretty dry. Brisket dinner was sliced, zero bark, floating in a broth which is very strange and tells me it&#39;s cooked extremely dry and needed it for flavor and to make it juicy but flavor it had none! Wife had pulled pork which again was dry, zero bark with so little smokey flavor I don&#39;t get it! Then to make it all better that night was sick from the food..

They had a live band and several TVs. TVs had the basketball game, hockey game, America&#39;s funniest videos and a Dale Earnhardt documentary on. There was more then plenty to watch.

Menu choices are really quite limited...do you want smoked this or smoked that. We started with the corn bread &#34;served with maple butter&#34;...then why put green chili pepper in the corn bread? I asked the server 1 question. What are Ranch Fries? &#34;well, you know, fried potatoes. They have a ranch seasoning on them&#34;. OK, what is the ranch seasoning? Is it code? Are they spicy??? To which she replied that spicy is a personal thing. Big help. I opted for the Cole Slaw. Big mistake. That had so much black pepper mixed in it I couldn&#39;t eat it. Husband tried it and agreed it was even too spicy for him. Pepsi products, yuck. Water in mason jars supposed to be cute, but before I drink it I want to know the lemon floating in it was washed before it was cut and plopped in the jar. Husband got the brisket dinner, with the ranch fries and beans. He said the best thing on the plate was the beans. BTW, tasted the ranch fries, not spicy. In fact they were bland.
I&#39;m not sure if the female servers are instructed to flirt with male patrons or if it was only the 3 I noticed. Our server stroked my husband&#39;s arm, flung an arm across his shoulder and generally acted like an idiot from a southern road house. Surprise sweetie, this is Illinois, and bigger surprise, I paid the check! Did you notice the tip, sure hope so!

It was clean and the service was good.  In terms of the food, we ordered a variety, and the best things we had were the broasted chicken and the sweet potato fries (which were waffle fries - so they were already better in my book).  

&#34;I heard it from a friend who, heard if from a friend who ...&#34; said this place had some good BBQ.  Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t.  Nothing looked or tasted like it was smoked and all the meat was covered in so much sauce that I couldn&#39;t taste anything other than the sauce.  Mind you, the BBQ sauce was pretty good, but there was way more than I wanted, or expected.  I&#39;d like to say the meat without the sauce was good, but my wife ordered the pulled pork without any sauce and it was so plain that even she didn&#39;t like it (she orders everything plain).  If you decide to go, here&#39;s how we&#39;d rate the food:

Broasted Chicken - 4
Sweet potato fries - 3.5
Cornbread - 3.5 - sweet and moist
Fries - 3.5 - surprisingly crunchy in a good way
Ribs - 3 - tender but not smoked 
Pulled pork - 3 - flavorless
Sausage - 3 
Broasted Potato - 3
Green beans - 3
Beef Brisket - 2 - chopped not sliced, way too much sauce
Beans - 2
Coleslaw - 1"

I love classic and outlaw country. I love BBQ. Combine these two and I&#39;m in love. Put it in Bartlett?? I feel like there&#39;s hope in my world. 

Food is good. Beer is good with a descent selection (Lagunitas and Hamm&#39;s in the same cooler). I finally got to hang in the bar after dragging the family here a couple times and loved it. The soundtrack is the best part. I want to put live music in here and it would be perfect...but I doubt that will happen. My only complaint (and this is of most places I frequent) is the need to fill the dining area with flat screens). If you&#39;re a sports bar I get it. If you&#39;re playing Wheel of Fortune it feels cheep and distracting and I&#39;d rather enjoy the moment that I escape to the sounds of real country music and smoked meat. 

But give them a chance. Admit it, you love the suburbs but at times you miss the city. Give this place your patronage and encourage more of the good behavior."

Dinner on Monday was in an almost empty restaurant with attentive service, good ribs, great mashed potatoes, fresh cornbread, hand battered fried green beans and nice chicken. We learned a lot during this visit. Everyone agreed that although we didn&#39;t love everything that the service and the food were good enough to warrant another visit soon. 

At 8:15 on Friday evening, it was well past the busy dinner hour and so we headed back. Promptly greeted and seated, we sat down and waited. They were busier and ultimately seemed confused. My husband said things like: Are they trying to run the customers out of here?  A large group walked in and moved tables and chairs around to accommodate themselves. Then another mid-sized group walked in and asked for a table but was told the wait would be an hour. What?!?!  The staff should have moved a table and a couple chairs just like their other patrons had just done to welcome their guests. Nope. They just let them walk right out the door. They were there to drink at almost nine o&#39;clock on a Friday night?  It doesn&#39;t take a business degree to know that was a bad business move. 

After finally placing our order and anxiously awaiting our meals, the food was wrong. My burger was covered in cheese - I did not order cheese, so I sent it back. The same burger arrived back in front of me a few short minutes later with the cheese peeled off and now cooked to death. Yuck!  Why ask how I want it cooked if you are going to ruin it anyhow?  Well, at least the yummy mashed potatoes are still here. Um...Nevermind. These potatoes tasted so old, I truly thought they could have been the leftovers from Monday!  

I sent the whole thing back. It was after nine and I was just done. No one wanted to refill my drink. It was a complete disappointment after Monday being decent. I figured the owner would swing by and extend an apology and some indication that he wanted us to try them again. Nope. He&#39;s very busy knocking back cocktails at the end of the bar. And I don&#39;t know who the sullen woman is that walks back and forth without saying a word to the customers and only snapping at the staff, but she could use some sunshine in her day. I hope she cheers up soon before there aren&#39;t any customers to scowl at. 

As for the space, some of my favorite restaurants are in strip malls, so I wouldn&#39;t allow that to be a deterrent. 

Maybe it was an off night. But it was too far off for me to give them anymore of my hard earned money."

Other then that, it sucked. The first sign we noticed upon entering, there was no smoke smell. Any good smoke BBQ restaurant you walk into, you walk out of smelling like smoke. I feel bad that I actually took my wife here for our anniversary, instead of making the hour trip to Smoque BBQ in Chicago. Their brisket tasted like a pot roast. No rings and none of that delicious charred ends. The pulled pork and sausage had no smoke flavor either. You can tell a good smoked sausage when it has that initial snap, when you first bite into it. The sausage tasted like it&#39;s been in a crockpot all day. All these meats were overwhelmed with BBQ sauce, in order to mask that crockpot taste. Sad to say, I was told about this place from a friend. I now know that she has no idea of what good BBQ should taste like. I&#39;m going to introduce her to Smoque BBQ in Chicago."

As for the food?  No thanks.  I tried the chicken and waffles, a combination I usually love.  I was very diappointed to be served breaded chicken tenders instead of actual bone in chicken.  The syrup was obviously that fake artificial corn syrup crap.  We make this better at home. I tried my husband&#39;s fries and they were so unappetizing and plain.  I couldn&#39;t wait to shower once I got home to get the oil smell off of me that permeated all our food.

Recently brought my family here.  We are bbq fanatics, and as I travel a lot, often hit local places.  While there is potential here, mainly due what seems a lot of hard work happening, they have a long LONG way to go.

First, the service - As I mention, I travel for work, and so, eat out often every week, so have what I feel is a good understanding on how long it should take from the time I sit down, til the time food is coming.  Service was extremely slow here, and not on an overly busy night, but I also watched my server constantly on the run.  Watching further, I had a dilemma, as I could tell he was working hard, but between being improperly staffed and the inefficient setup, he was doomed from the start.  We had a view to the kitchen, and it seemed the same.  But waiting for 15 minutes to get our drinks and 30 for our appetizers, and nearly an hour for our dinner for a table of 3, I wasn&#39;t impressed.

Now on to the food - first off, using the same batter for every item, including the chicken &amp; waffles, just got to be overload.  The waffles were like hockey pucks and overall that dish was lackluster.

The pulled pork was very disappointing, no smoke flavor whatsoever.

As for the brisket, it was very dry, very little smoke ring, and Luke warm.  It made me wonder if anything is actually smoked, or just cooked in an oven with a makeshift pan smoker.

On to the sauces, None of us were pleased with any of the tastes.  I&#39;m not quite sure what they&#39;ve done, but one tasted a bit acidic even.

Overall, none of were greatly impressed, which is a shame, as we really wanted to be.  It&#39;s debatable if we&#39;ll go back, if they last, I&#39;ll probably give it another try,  but for that time, I&#39;ll go alone before spending a good chunk of change taking the family.

I&#39;m hopeful, they&#39;ll sort out things, as, like I said, I could see a lot of hard work going on, it just hadn&#39;t delivered results as of yet."

The all-you-can-eat fish fry was perfection: tartar sauce is clearly homemade and made well. Fish was tasty and crisp. Coleslaw was somewhat bland, but very fresh. My friend had the ribs, green beans and waffle fries - all of which she raved about. Our server was really helpful when we couldn&#39;t decide what to order and extremely attentive throughout the rest of the meal.

The decor was very welcoming and the restaurant was very clean. Our server was friendly and attentive. I had the sampler trio because I could not decide on the pulled pork, the chicken or brisket. The chicken with the Carolina Mustard BBQ sauce was my favorite. The brisket was also good and the pulled pork had a sauce with a little zing to it. Plus they served Hamms beer in a can and that was a favorite of mine way back when. I will definitely be back to try one of platters."

The food was hit or miss from when they opened until recently.  The service is VERY spotty,   Last waitress we had should not be in the service industry.

I ordered the Still Signature Burger which comes with bbq smoked brisket,  1/2 pound burger, Applewood bacon and pepper jack cheese on a pretzel bun. You have a choice of fries, french fries or sweet potato waffle fries. I had the waffle fries. 
My wife ordered The Still Melt. It also has a 1/2 pound burger, onion straws, American cheese on grilled marble rye bread. With soft drinks our bill with tip was $40.00. What a great meal.

This was my first time here so I don&#39;t have much to go on but my first impressions.  The food and drinks were pretty good.  The only thing that is stopping me from giving it 5 stars is a couple of &#34;logistical&#34; things.  First, specials listed on the board said &#34;St Patrick&#39;s Specials&#34;. This led me to believe that it was for just that day but for the weekend and Monday leading up to.  Not the case.  They might want to note that it is only for that day.  

The next is the description on the menu of some items.  I got the Catfish.  Let me say, it was good.  And the sweet potato waffle fries and green beans were good too.  However, the menu gave a choice of Seasoned and Grilled or BATTERED and fried.  What ended up coming to the table was breaded.  It was good regardless but I was expecting Battered.  

Lastly, I was thinking about taking a bit of dessert home.  On the board they had Key Lime Pie, cheesecake and a couple other items.  I mentioned the Key Lime Pie (my wife had brought me home a piece a couple weeks ago and it was delicious.  I am told they make their desserts in house).  The server said that was the one thing I couldn&#39;t get.  They didn&#39;t make any that day.  I guess it goes back to if you&#39;re going to put something on your &#34;specials&#34; board, make sure its available.  

But like I said, overall good time.  I will be back even though its mostly BBQ and I am not a fan.  There are some items that do not involve BBQ."

What drew us in was the ridiculously awesome smell that hung in the air from the parking lot! REALLY cute little place. Separate TO GO area. Nice bar area. Small&#39;ish dining area. Simply decorated &amp; very clean. We ordered a combo type BBQ plate &amp; a rib/fried catfish combo. The BBQ was very good. I especially enjoyed the pulled pork. The brisket was &#34;ok&#34;, the texture was a little dry. The ribs were outstanding, fall off the bone. The deep fried catfish was the evening winner, it was OUTSTANDING! The cole slaw was &#34;meh&#34;, the baked beans were &#34;meh&#34;. Cornbread didn&#39;t even need butter!! Good beer choices, especially if you&#39;re looking for IPA.

Our server, Tiffany, was upbeat, energetic and absolutely wonderful! She could not have been friendlier, more knowledgeable or awesome! She really made our evening. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to come back again. I really hope this place makes it!"

I should have known it wasn&#39;t going to be barbeque by the fact that there was no smoke anywhere when we were walking up.  The dining room was awkward and the booths seemed a little cramped.  There was almost too much light in the dining room.  Service was okay.  The beer list could have been larger.  

I ordered the Hillbilly Surf and Turf.  This is when I knew I wouldn&#39;t be coming back.  The brisket came out and right away you can tell it was not smoked.  There was no smoke ring, which should be very apparent in a meat that takes hours and hours to barbeque.  It had the shimmery glimmer that I remember seeing on roast beef when I worked at a hospital cafeteria in high school.  The catfish was okay.  It was deep fried, but not really seasoned.  Adding some Tony Chacere&#39;s or some other spice blend would go a long way.

Places like this should really call their food what it is and not throw a BBQ label on it.  I had high hopes for this place, but it is another place pitching a poor attempt at BBQ/Southern food.  There are much better places to go in the third largest metropolitan area in the U.S. than The Still."

So far away from Bar B Que, that you may as well be ordering szechuan from an Italian joint! Throwing store bought BBQ sauce onto over processed GFS type meat, is hardly what should be labeled &#39;Star Studded&#39;. 

Both of the meals ordered on the occasion of our visit ( the smokey mountain combo and the smoked brisket ) were so over cooked and leathery, we did not attempt to complete the meal. When our server came to clear the plates in front of us, seeing the majority of the food still on the dishes, they avoided eye contact and swooped away like hawks after road-kill ( which is pretty much what we were served). 

And &#34; World Famous Chicken Fingers   $8.99&#34; - Now THAT is nerve! 

Also Be warned -you know  that over-priced &#39;specialty moonshine cocktail&#39;, well it is not worth the glass it&#39;s poured in.. If I could give this place a -1 star I would.

My wife and I went in for drinks on a Saturday night just to see what the place was like. Decent prices for their drink specials which is always nice. We looked at the menu to get an idea of what they served. I found lots of things I plan on trying. We had just eaten so it wouldn&#39;t be that night. 

A few thoughts for the owner if they are reading. 1) The bartender working that night was nice but not very engaging. She had minimal interaction with any of the customers. 2) There was a sign out in front of the restaurant that said that there was a sangria special. A group came in and a few asked for the sangria only to be told they were out of it. If you are out, take it off the sign! 3) The wood trim in the bar (that&#39;s the only part we saw) looks great but having a plain, colored cement floor just looks tacky. Maybe a wood floor? Even a fake one would look better than what is there. 

I really want this place to succeed because I&#39;m a fan of BBQ.

1/8/16 - Service is terrible. It took 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out. Even longer for the main course. The excuse was there were a lot of take-out orders ahead of ours. Here&#39;s a hint, Mr. Owner. Take care of the people in the building. You can tell the people on the phone it will be an hour for pickup and they would be fine. If you told me it would be an hour when I came in, I would have left.  Take my comments for what it is worth but I won&#39;t be going back. Besides, the food wasn&#39;t that good."

My boyfriend plays on a softball team and after the games some of us will go out for dinner. We thought The Still was our new place. I want this review to be as fair as possible, as I really love small local businesses and that&#39;s why we were so excited about The Still in the first place. That&#39;s why I&#39;m giving them 3 stars instead of letting my feelings get the best of me and giving 1 star. 

Our first visit was great. We all enjoyed our meals, had great service and tried a few fun drinks. I asked about a drink menu and was told they were working on one. Our second visit was okay as well. Our waitress was less informed and pretty shy this time. They still didn&#39;t have a drink menu and she really didn&#39;t have any drink suggestions for us. The food was still good. We really liked the fried pickles, and the smoked sausage. I tried the broasted chicken this visit and it was just ok. The chicken itself was really tasty and juicy, but the broasted portion wasn&#39;t great. Boyfriend had the ribs and those were pretty good. 

Our third visit was yesterday. We came with a group of 12. We all ordered drinks, appetizers and meals. The first problem we noticed was how warm it was inside, I&#39;m normally freezing all the time and even I was uncomfortable. The guys in our group were all sweating. We asked about the air and was told it was on, but not working very well. No huge deal, things happen. Our sweet waitress apologized. Where things started going wrong was when our food started coming out. Entrees were brought to our party 1 at a time, and all of them a couple minutes a part. Not one of us was served at the same time. Eventually 20 minutes later everyone in my party of 12 had food. All but two people had finished their meals.  Problem was I still wasn&#39;t served mine. Nobody even acknowledged us to say &#39;I&#39;m sorry, the rest of your meals will be right up&#39;. The people in our party who did have their food felt bad eating before everyone was served. At this point I didn&#39;t even want my food anymore. It still hadn&#39;t come, everyone else was done eating and I just didn&#39;t want to sit there and eat by myself. So when the owner walked by I stopped her and let her know what was happening. I told her that we had already been there for 90 min, everyone had eaten and I still didn&#39;t have my food. I told her that I just didn&#39;t want my meal anymore. I didn&#39;t yell at her, I didn&#39;t speak rudely. I simply let her know what was happening. The response I got from her was shocking. I wasn&#39;t offered an apology of any kind. Instead I was made to feel like a jerk for even letting her know. She very sternly (that&#39;s putting it nicely) told me that the kitchen was short staffed because of the holiday weekend, they couldn&#39;t keep up, they were doing the best they could. I wish I could properly describe the inflection and tone in her statement. She walked away offering no form of an apology. I sat there shocked feeling like she expected an apology from me for visiting her restaurant on a holiday weekend, as if my patronage of her restaurant was a big inconvenience. Im not responsible for staffing her kitchen. A few minutes later she walked by our table and without even stopping she &#39;aggressively&#39; stated (I have no idea how else to explain it) that she took my drink, appetizer and my unserved meal off our tab). She didn&#39;t even stop to personally address me, just kept walking as she said it and again, no apology. My entire table of 12 was shocked. We couldn&#39;t believe how unfairly rude she was to me. Our waitress heard the way the owner spoke to us and she immediately came over and apologized to us, she seemed incredibly embarrassed. I should add that our waitress that day was great, very sweet.  

In the end, the owner handled the mistake accordingly by removing a drink and appetizer from our tab, I take that as the apology. However she did this very begrudgingly and with total disdain for myself. There was never a verbal apology. When I let her know there was an issue she immediately jumped to the defense. This is not customer service. I had even let her know that this was our third visit since they opened just a month ago. None of that seemed to matter to her. She didn&#39;t seem to appreciate the fact that we came with 12 people who could have become regular guests. When opening a new business, word of mouth is everything. Great customer service and a smile really go a long way. This all could have been resolved with a simple apology, a smile and a correction. Instead it looks like they lost our continued business. There was just no reason for things to have happened as they did."

Food? Bad, overcooked, TOUGH brisket. Seriously folks, it&#39;s BBQ it&#39;s not that hard. Second... Prices... Outrageous. There are a LOT better places around. Charging $7 for &#34;Hillbilly Salsa&#34; or whatever that was ? That&#39;s nuts. A small bowl of chips and &#34;Sorry, I have to charge you for more chips? That&#39;s insulting.

Drinks... meh, just some made up stuff.

Waitstaff, not good. Poorly managed. Maybe they&#39;ll get it right. I hope so, but if they don&#39;t change the prices, they&#39;ll be gone by March."

The ribs were ok - tender. The pulled pork and the beef brisket were nothing to write home about. Both sandwiches needed a lot more meat. The brisket meat was fatty and sparse. I expected barbeque sauce on the table - none was to be found. For a place called &#39;The Still&#39; they didn&#39;t have a printed drink menu - at least none was offered to me or my three friends.  There was plenty of parking. I won&#39;t be going back.

My biggest concern was the initial description I read touting it as a liquor-themed establishment -  not at all the kind of place Bartlett needs. It&#39;s actually very family friendly (the bar is separated from the dining area) and the focus is really on the smoked pork and other Tennessee-themed menu options. The moonshine is just an excellent bonus &amp; deviates from the same ol&#39; beer &amp; wine menu in most restaurants.
The decor is a little bland, but I&#39;m sure the character of the interior will develop as does the clientele."

So far I&#39;ve had the brisket and the brisket sandwich, plus I&#39;ve tried the chicken, pulled pork, and chicken fingers.
The brisket was really good, not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but smoky, tasty and if you live near Bartlett, you should like it.  I tasted the chicken and pork and they were good too but I like the brisket better.
Each meat came in a different sauce and all were delicious, either having smoke, tang, or heat.  The brisket sandwich made me not hate pretzel buns and join the rest of society but it was a little fattier than just ordering the meal.  The baked beans side is just average, the cornbread is very good, and the cole slaw you&#39;re on your own...I hate coleslaw more than Mondays. The chicken fingers are fantastic!  They&#39;re juicy and delicious and the batter is not like normal batter....it&#39;s light and airy and very good.
As for the place itself.  It&#39;s kinda weird.  The decor....well, it&#39;s not good.  The place is small and looks like a cafeteria a little bit. Someone said a wood floor would change the whole place and they were right.  There&#39;s a small bar in a different room so family types won&#39;t have to put up with you lonely drinker types and vice versa.  It looks nice but I didn&#39;t try it.  By the way, don&#39;t let the term moonshine scare you.  I tried two of their speciality drinks, both of which were refreshing and not boozy tasting at all.
The staff is friendly, but there&#39;s a blond lady there who, while friendly, seems awkward around people....I think she&#39;s one of the owners. The only advice I can give them is that sometimes they are a little light on the sauce for my taste. I wish they&#39;d put some bottles of each sauce on the table so you could try them all and as much as you want.
All in all the place is a little pricey but definitely worth a try.  I know I&#39;ll be going back there more often."

There was a 30 minute or so wait. We went to the bar area which is very small. We stood for a while and finally a large group that had been in the seating area left...and left a huge mess. We sat in the midst of dirty glasses. No one came to pick them up. Gross. Once seated, we received our menus from the hostess but waited about another ten minutes for our waitress. In the middle of trying to order, she was called over to take the check from another table, and then went to another table to take their order! She didn&#39;t come back for another ten minutes! The food was decent, not spectacular, but the service was horrible. We will try them again sometime since there are so few restaurants in Bartlett and will hope it has improved."

The blackberry Tennessee moonshine went down too easily!  Service was good but even though it is a small space, the waitstaff seemed a little stretched. The lack of five stars is because we had an issue with a wrong side order. They corrected it without an issue but the right side came well into our meal. Definitely a place we will frequent."

Had a Tennessee Lemonade which was very good. $7 a mason jar seemed a little bit high as it wasn&#39;t really that strong.  To each their own though, right?  Bartender was pleasant but kind of distant. she Thought I was there for take out.  Had the pulled pork sandwich. Came in like 5 minutes literally. Was pretty good, glad the bartender recommended some bbq sauce on it as it needed it. The sweet potato waffle fries weren&#39;t great though. 
Bar Atmosphere was just okay. Very small. They had two tvs. One had on shark tank the other had on Mash and Andy Griffith. Why?  Seemed to have a younger crowd there, I left early cause I was sick of watching black and white reruns.  Seems like if you are going to the bar, you might want to reconsider a go and into the dining room. Seems strange for a place whose schtick is moonshine.

We&#39;ve been to The Still several times in the past year - the food ranged from good to just okay, depending on the visit. However, our friends (very sweet, polite people) were treated badly, where a member of the staff wasn&#39;t content to be rude in the restaurant, but chased them into the parking lot with insults - all because they preferred not to wait for a table. That&#39;s enough for me, and, our neighbors - we&#39;ll go elsewhere. Bartlett needs more restaurants, ones that care."

Loved the slaw and happy we ordered extra.  My son had the flatbread bbq chicken with fried onions.   Also great.  My husband had the cheeseburger.  Simple yet so many places do not get his order correct!  He loved it.  Our drinks were refilled in a timely manner.  We are all looking forward to our leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

We decided to go back tonight and had a bizarre experience, and based on other reviews I can see that this is a common theme.
We walked in and saw about 8 tables occupied, by no means a full house. We waited at the door a few minutes while trying to determine if we should take a seat. 2 waitresses walked past us but no acknowledgment, so we started walking to a table. A waitress passed and I looked at her and said &#34; sit anywhere? &#34; she ignored me like I was invisible. We sat and watched them walk back &amp; forth, trying to make eye contact, even when they served the table right next to us. It was as if they wanted to teach us a lesson for seating ourselves. Another group walked in and they were seated almost immediately, and drink orders taken. After about 10 minutes of that we walked out. I&#39;ve never walked out of a restaurant until tonight. Sorry to say I would never go back or take a chance on recommending this possible experience to someone else."

That was fine with us . We were the only customers in the bar . There was no bartender to be seen. After approximately 10 minutes a woman did come into the bar, stood right in front of us, did not greet us, made several drinks and left the bar. Another group came into the bar and still no bartender. At about 15 minutes we were told  by another staff person that our table would be ready soon. My husband asked if we could order a drink and the server said.&#34;Oh I&#39;ll find the barteender&#34;. Finally the women who had previously made drinks behind the bar came in and took my husbands order.  We were seated.  When the waitress came to our table I asked to see a drink menu. She said they did not have one yet and &#34;we are  working on it&#34;. When I asked what their speciality drink was, she said &#34;one made with our moonshine&#34;. I asked what was in it. She told me &#34;moonshine, lemonaide and Amaretto&#34;  I said  I didn&#39;t like Amaretto. She never mentioned any other drinks so I just ordered water. I ordered the surf and turf which was catfish and brisket, my husband ordered the smoked turkey sandwich.  He said the turkey was good. My brisket was very tough, some bites so tough I couldn&#39;t even chew them. My catfish was bland and nothing special. My side of coleslaw was very small, about 2 tablespoons. They gave me more tarter sauce than coleslaw. The slaw was bland. The side of baked beans was good as well as the sweet potato fries. 
While we were eating multiple groups came it. Some were greeted by a staff person, others looked around for a hostess, saw none and seated themselves. One couple who had been waiting awhile for a hostess, finally seated themselves at one of the 2 empty tables. They were told by the bartender lady they couldn&#39;t sit there because another couple had been there ahead of them. They said no, that they had been there first, which they had.  The bartender woman didn&#39;t appear to believe them. They left the restaurant.   
Overall the service was very poor and the food nothing special. The owner seemed nice. We overheard him talking to some customers near us.  When our waitress asked how our food was and I said that my brisket was very tough, she made no comment."

Food- hubby ordered chili, he likes spicy food, but he said it was awfully hot, like someone dumped a cup of jalapeno seeds and a whole bottle of hot sauce in it, so hot in flavor he couldn&#39;t eat it!!  He got 3 tablespoons down and the rest went to waste. I told him to tell bartender (we ate in the bar) but he didn&#39;t want to make a fuss.  I ordered BBQ wings.  They brought me Hot wings. That&#39;s not what I ordered, but I just got off of work and I was starving and couldn&#39;t wait any longer. So that was bad but then....The wings were really bad, so dried out, so small!  Seriously the wings seemed to have been made days prior, then flash fried just to make them hot. There was little meat and the meat that was on the wings was completely dried out.  We also ordered the onion straw stack which was very delicious.  This place is worthy of 1 more try - I hope NOT to be disappointed.  There was a &#34;regular&#34; there, who said all the food was awesome. His burger looked great, so we&#39;ll give it one more chance....."

We were greeted and seated promptly. Service was prompt. We waited about 10 mins after order. 

I was impressed with the sashimi (good quality fish, usual horse radish and soy by the side). 

The yakisoba tasted suspiciously like instant noodles with clever addition of bulgogi and vegetables (I checked - it is actually instant noodles). Not bad tasting (but bars are low when I eat instant noodles) - whether it&#39;s the right thing to do, would be left to your discretion. 

Not a particular fan of the bento box with tonkotsu. I felt there was too much bread and the meat tasted like it was prepared in advance and hence dry and a little chewy. 

Food prices were reasonable and good portions. 

Overall, I would say this is the &#34;run of the mill&#34; variety pseudo Japanese/Korean place with reasonably well priced edible food. But the sashimi is great, try it."

The good:
+ Friendly staff
+ Lunch special prices Mon-Fri 11:30AM to 2:30PM
+ Happy hour prices M-Sat 5pm to 6PM
+ Clean restaurant; clean bathrooms
+ Ample parking (lot and street parking)

The bad:
- Appetizers are not made in the restaurant. They are from Asian grocery stores. Go to Mitsuwa in Arlington Heights and get their shrimp shumai &amp; gyoza from the refrigerated section. Exact same thing. Was disappointed to get this. I was expecting something made from scratch. 

- My fave is the shrimp crunch. We went here 2 weeks ago and there was barely any shrimp in it; mostly batter.

- As other reviewers pointed out, the ramen here is store-bought, too.

The verdict: 
There are better sushi and ramen restaurants out there. Skip this place unless you are stuck in Des Plaines and super craving for store-bought Japanese food."

I wouldn&#39;t normally review a sushi joint and recommend you go out of your way to eat their product but in the case of Dotombori, I would recommend you stop in for some rolls. 
Do it.

Des Plaines you say? Sushi?
I know, a little blip on the map. Unless you are parking here for the train, severely lost or randomly passing through on your way to one of the neighboring towns - consider visiting here for some lunch or dinner. 

My wife and I have been stuck here in corporate housing and happened upon this place out of shear desperation. We figured the local praises were warranted given the lack of sushi in the area. 

None of that matters. 

This place is legit and boasts some rolls/flavor combinations I have never seen - let alone tried.

Super tasty. Super affordable. Super quick.

The owner is the sweetest little old lady and makes an effort to remember your name and treat you as if you were a visitor in her house.
Every time. 

If I had to recommend one favorite roll it would be the Mango Gaga. A tiny dip in some soy sauce gives this roll the best sweet, sour and umami flavor.

Also, the large beers that make me happy as there arent many options for dinner in Des Plaines that also serve alcohol."

WOW! Many times we went out for sushi, got a few rolls and there was one or two that were the &#34;good ones&#34;... all of the ones from here were DELICIOUS!!!! We got four rolls and figured we won&#39;t finish them since it was a lot but nope, we ate it all and felt &#34;awesome full&#34;!

Not to hate on the suburbs *too* much, but this place actually exists in the suburbs?!  I LOVED Dotombori.  Their lunch specials were amazing.  AH-MAZE-ING.  We got a giant bowl of ramen and a roll or tempura for $7.95.  That&#39;s it!  The ramen is vegetarian and you can get regular or spicy - I totally recommend spicy.  The bowl of noodles, veggies, and broth is huge so really that&#39;s all you need.

However, they also have lunch special rolls so we ordered two just to try them out.  One was deep fried and one was spicy and they were both super delicious.  Unfortunately, that was too much food for two people so I recommend only getting one additional roll or just getting the tempura as your side for ramen.  

Service was relatively quick, the place was fairly quiet for a weekday afternoon, and we loved the food.  What more could you want?  Be sure to arrive before 1:30 p.m. for the lunch special - they end it at 2:00 p.m. but they really mean they&#39;ll stop serving after 1:30 because then you&#39;d be there well after 2.  They probably should advertise that better since someone came in while we were eating and got super angry at the employees but it seemed like something dumb to be angry about since it&#39;s like a three-hour lunch special to begin with."

Our waitress was a delightful woman. She took our order and when I tried to order egg fried rice she said they didn&#39;t have it so I just asked for plain. When our food did come out she brought me egg fried rice. She said they were kinda slow so the chef was able to make it for me. Very thoughtful. When she brought out our food she made sure to organize the plates in a pleasing manner. She got my fried rice all set up and told me that I needed to take a picture of it and said, &#34;Smile Fried Rice&#34; That made me laugh haha.  

Atmosphere- Pretty typical of a sushi place

Staff- Very attentive and pretty humorous, one made me laugh a lot. 

Food- Very good all around

Edamame- Top notch- very fresh and well salted
Caterpillar roll- Great roll, loved every bit of it 
California roll- Also another great roll
Egg Fried Rice- Rice was ok, I ate it all, I added some soy sauce to spruce it up a bit.

It reminded me of the trip and the smaller restaurants I had visited abroad. A great job, although it does seem to be kind of &#34;Asian fusion&#34; rather than just Japanese. I have only a few comments that I think would have made it the perfect experience...1. The service was impeccable for the States - no complaint! But when I was in Japan, there were devices to request service (electronically - press a button, and &#34;poof&#34; - you had the attention of wait staff! This would not seemingly be cost prohibitive with wireless, etc. and would be a fantastic addition. 2. Change the background music to something more suitable - I do like oldies and early American rock n roll, but you went through such a great job making a visual appeal to the Orient in your décor, why not have some soothing pentatonically based music as the background? 3. I loved gyoza in Japan - it was basically, to the best I can equate, little fried cabbage rolls. The gyoza you served was good, but seemed to be made of dough, like a dumpling, rather than a cabbage wrap. Please win my heart and stomach over totally - everything else I tasted was as spot on as could be in the U.S.

The food was overall great - service great - clean. Very enjoyable! Thank you so much!"

For dinner, we had 4 rolls: the Las Vegas, Spicy Crunch, Viking, and White Dragon. All were incredibly tasty, though my favorite was the Las Vegas by far. It had mozzarella cheese on it, which sounds like it wouldn&#39;t be too appetizing, but it was delicious.

This time, service was very attentive. We were checked on often, and our waters were topped off frequently. The only service I didn&#39;t like was that after we paid, we were sitting for a bit finishing up our sake, and a waitress came up and asked if we needed anything else. We realized there was a couple waiting at the bar area, and the waitress was trying to get us to hurry out so that the couple could have our table. OK, I understand. But still.

All that food and sake and the total came to around $50. Completely reasonable. I&#39;ll make sure to head back soon!"

Anyway, after today&#39;s nice lunch outing, we will certainly be back.  They are Korean run and have a mainly sushi, sashimi, and bento box menu.

Originally, I had thought we had a pleasant first-time experience at Dotombori.  The Spicy Rainbow and Mango Sushi were refreshing and revived my jaded seafood palate.  The decor was simple, elegant, and overall is well-kept.  Then it dawned on me;  There were two major red flags I should have picked up on!

The signature rolls average about $15.  I&#39;m fairly accustomed to that figure, but not after what I now realized:  Don&#39;t be fooled by the photos or when the food is first presented.  

Yes, the rolls are colorful, plump, and scrape the sky.  What you don&#39;t pick up on is that the sushi that seemingly covers the roll is PAPER THIN.

From my observation, the rolls are triple or sometimes even quadruple the average thickness of rice you would find in more upscale sushi venues.  Combined with paper thin sushi and a $15 price point, this is a thinly-veiled way of overcharging.

The second red flag that I should have picked up on was the final bill.  2 Miso soups, 1 seaweed salad, 1 OMG, 1 Spicy Rainbow, 1 Mango Salmon, 1 Lycheetini (delicious), and 1 Asian Peartini (extra delicious) came out to $62.50.  Final total after tax, before-tip, was $68.75.  Not bad . . . Right?

The kicker is their tip guide at the bottom:
15% Gratuity = $10.31
18% Gratuity = $12.38
20% Gratuity = $13.75

Makes sense.... Oh no it doesn&#39;t.. 

$10.31 / 15% = $68.75
$12.38 / 18% = $68.78 (!?)
$13.75 / 20% = 68.75

Their tip guide is representing how much you should tip on the TAX as well!!!  I don&#39;t know about you, but Uncle Sam has a large enough presence in my life already . . . I should not have to tip him as well.  

Very sneaky to an unsuspecting customer who is looking to correctly tip on the quality of food and service received (subtotal), not on Sam&#39;s shadow.

It may seem like I&#39;m making mountains out of mole hills, but I feel these two items are just blatant, sketchy, veiled business tactics that detract away from the overall experience."

My friend was already there and ordered a selection of rolls and nigri but she had no clue and clearly having a tough time - I don&#39;t think sushi is for her, despite my suggestions. I&#39;m not even anything near of an expert on Japanese cuisine but I know what I want &amp; like, and have an open mind to try stuff, even if it sounds yucky.

I had a few California rolls and an assortment of tuna, salmon, and shrimp - all were decently tasty but it seems to not quite taste and prepared if it was done by an expert, and a Japanese one at that. Washed that down with some tea, had a few more rolls and assorted nigri, and left for the night.

Decor was nice, had some Japanese and Asian touches for the interior, and generic tables and chairs. Music played didn&#39;t detract from the masticating activities or the conversations. The wait staff (and I think the owner too) tried to be helpful and did fairly well to serve us.

Next time I come around, I&#39;ll need to try the fish dishes and bento box, and will update this review as well as the rating.

The exterior looks decent, but patrons who were interesting in coming in had a difficult time figuring out if they were &#34;open&#34; since it appeared to pretty dark inside.  The hours were posted on the entrance.  They only open during lunch and dinner time, so the business hours were not continuous.  

We ordered the specials for today: chicken katsu curry and spicy salmon sushi combo.  There was another neon board with four (4) other specials, one being salmon tataki...Well, I should have ordered that.  

Everything we ordered had a good taste, and the quality of fish was pretty good as well.  However, I had a feeling that I should have ordered something else.  On a side note, I felt that katsu was over-prices: $15!  The size of the cutlet was average, and there was nothing special about it.  Regarding my sushi combo, I can for sure find a better deal in Chicago.  The table near us ordered some kind of tempura lunch combo and the presentation looked more glamorous than our order.  I guess there will always be next time.  

Despite the ordering chargin, the atmosphere was cozy and private.  I enjoy the Korean music playing on the background.  I think I may have an opportunity to come back and give them another chance.  

By the way, the total came to $35...yeah, kind of steep, but it is what a Japanese restaurant typically charges.  I will stick with my hole-in-the-wall Lawrence Fish Market."

I ordered for two, but it was just me :)
Miso and house salad to start. They have the perfect blend of dressing and they do a great job of coating the lettuce.
The miso was very flavorful, lots of tofu and seaweed. 
Main course was sushi and sashimi dinner and I upgraded to the Hawaiian roll. Best decision ever, as that roll made my top three favorites, immediately. 
The place was busy, luckily I found a spot at the bar, and watched as the chefs prepped each dish. Such skill and care went into each plate and it&#39;s presentation. 
The flavors were a perfect blend. Mango, a light amount of heat (before I added wasabi) and a bright freshness to the Roll made it a palate pleaser.

I ordered an Asian peartini. It took 20 minutes for me to get my drink. My waiter was unfamiliar with one of the drinks on the menu, and didn&#39;t both to ask for clarification. He was friendly but inefficient. A different waitress had to help him pick up the slack. Overall, the service was slow. The lady behind me got and ate her food before I got mine. The decor was cute, I suppose. I ordered what I thought was a spicy tuna roll with 5 pieces of chef&#39;s choice Nigiri. I checked twice with the waiter to make sure it was Nigiri. What I got was the spicy salmon roll with sashimi. I checked with another waitress who said I got the right thing, but I&#39;m relatively certain that it was wrong. Sashimi has no rice, I got the sushi that the waiter told me was nigiri. The sashimi I got was tuna, salmon, and some type of white fish. Fresh, thick pieces but the white fish was a little funky. The spicy salmon roll was a hint of spicy, but not bold. Too much rice. Overall, it was an okay experience. Not mind-blowing, but not terrible. Mediocre. It took me an hour to get 2 drinks, and the lunch special. Not good if you&#39;re in a rush. Fortunately, I had an hour to kill before my car appointment."

What?!!! Huh?!!! By the way there were 5 empty tables at the time. And to make matters worst the server was holding off on our menu - The (Caucasian) folks that was sitting in front of us who came in 10 minutes after we came in got their menu before we did.

Traditional Japanese menu with all the stand-bys, plus some Korean dishes and specialty rolls. 

I had a deluxe bento box (with your choice of entree and roll) and started with agedashi tofu. The agedashi, deep fried blocks of tofu was great and I was pleased with the bento box, which was huge. 

The bento started with miso soup and a salad. Both were standard Japanese restaurant fare, not bad but not special. The bento box i coed five pieces of tempura, including one shrimp. Tempura was very good, healthy size veggies that were fried perfectly. I found the tempura sauce a tad bland. The box also had bulgogi (my choice of entree), which I thoroughly enjoyed but was more like beef teriyaki than traditional bulgogi. It also had good veggies. 

I was pretty full by this time when my huge kamikaze roll arrived (spicy tuna with regular tuna). The fish was very good, fresh and plentiful. I do wish I could have picked from any roll on the menu, they were all around the same price, but it delivered. 

Overall a very good meal."

It is really cute inside and I&#39;ve always had really great service.  I mostly end up at Dotombori for their lunch special.  You can pick any two rolls for around $9!  

Although the selection is kind of limited at lunch, I never have a problem finding something delicious.  I typically order the shrimp tempura rolls, which are nice and crispy with a delicious mayo on top.

It&#39;s Literally a Shin Ramyn (Korean instant Ramen you can buy in a grocery store). It taste great? Of course it does, with all the MSGs and chemical+greasy fried noodle grease. This instant ramen packet is about a $1 btw. It&#39;s a terrible deal even for a lunch special.  This place has the Dotombori only in name.  In fact it&#39;s a Korean-Japanese restaurant restaurant that&#39;s not that great. Mind you, i don&#39;t bash Korean Japanese sushi restaurants. I&#39;ve been to plenty and there are great ones out there. But this one here claims to be an authentic Japanese restaurant with the name and branding of Actual Japanese chain brand while it&#39;s not really a real one, let alone barely a &#39;Korean-Japanese Restaurant&#39;. They should have renamed the restaurant rather than pretend to be a real Japanese restaurant. I wonder if they even paid a royalty to use the restaurant name. Probably not, because if so, the restaurant chain would have forced the restaurant to behave certain way, i.e Not To Use Instant Noodle Packet to prepare Ramen Dish.  They should know that the cheap tricks only last so long, cheating on (white) people with sub-par food. While 5 piece sushi was decent, while their &#39;Ramen&#39; is so fake, not ethical, and just plain WRONG.  2 Stars."

The rolls are as good as they can get. From the Oh-My-God roll to the one with the slices of strawberries, and blackberry on top. It all melts in your mouth. The chef experiments all the time and there are rolls that are not on the menu - he has hung pictures of his new creations above his station. If you&#39;re feeling adventurous, you can even ask them to have the chef surprise you with one of his current masterpieces. All the rolls are a work of art as they are scrumptious. 

Looking from the outside, you&#39;re not sure what to think of this place because it looks very old-school, not loungey, like most sushi places nowadays.

The servers are super friendly and courteous. If you are in need of a compliment and a smile, this is the place to go to after a rough day.

Pros:
+ NO MSG at all, whatsoever (not even in the soup, and not even in the soy sauce)!
+ Very nice staff (friendly, helpful, kind)
+ Huge portions! Usually when you order sushi, the rolls are small, so we ordered 2 rolls and one of the Sashimi packages. When they brought out the first roll, it was huge! Then they brought out the second, and immediately, we knew we were going to need a take-home box (our sashimi hadn&#39;t even come out yet!). You definitely get your money&#39;s worth.
+ Cute place, clean, authentic Japanese soda...
+ Very good Miso soup
+ Great place to bring a date (intimate, dimmed lighting, soft background music, quiet) There are also many other stores around the area, great for taking a walk around the area together.
+ Many rolls to choose from
+ Reservation or walk in (we made reservations the previous night, and they gave us the table right by the storefront window (very nice). Table even had a &#34;reserved&#34; sign.
+ We were given a &#34;Rewards Card&#34;. This visit counted as the first, next visit will give us a free appetizer.
+ Free parking in lot around the block

Cons:
- I&#39;m not a huge fan of cilantro, and there was a strong taste of it in the rolls.
- Crab meat was listed in just about every roll (not all, but almost).
- Though you probably could bring kids there, the ambiance is quiet and intimate. Plus, they don&#39;t have a kids&#39; menu."

She wanted Kurumaya which is an authentic Japanese-owned restaurant, but it&#39;s a bit of a trek. Dotomobori is an OK substitute... since I am pregnant and cannot eat raw sushi, I didn&#39;t feel like I was missing too much by not going to Kurumaya. This restaurant is Korean-owned so we ordered the bulgogi bento box. My friend was VERY HUNGRY and it took a long time for our food to come out. The first time they gave us a teriyaki Chicken bento box. It was obviously a mistake since 2 other bentos went to a different table at the same time, but the people there started eating right away and the servers could not salvage our food. They did not apologize or give any explanation and made us wait another 10 minutes for our food. Bulgogi was seasoned ok, not too saucy, but the beef was really chewy and in big wads. Tempura was over battered and fried. Pieces were very big and difficult to eat gracefully. Came with 4 California roll pieces. We did not get any salad or miso soup with our bento lunches, not sure if they were supposed to come with. Overall, food was neither bad nor good. The cheap prices make up for it though, $7.95 for the lunch bento.


Updated from 3 to 2 stars: My coworker said I was too generous with my original 3 stars. It&#39;s been a couple hours since we ate here and she now feels sick from the oily food and can still taste the oil."

One evening after unsuccessful attempts at deciding upon a place to have dinner I ultimately granted his wishes and we went to Dotombori. And I totally loved it. The fish was all so fresh and well presented. We went with the chef&#39;s choice platter and it was great. We also had the yaki soba with chicken that was yum.

For Dotombori, 4 stars is just right.  Reliable, tasty sushi, mostly reasonable prices.  Not going to wow you usually, but that&#39;s not what they are going for considering the pricing.  Service is pleasant but sometimes inattentive.  Kamikaze roll is good and is also on happy hour menu (before 6pm - week nights only I believe).  Stay away from the gimmicky rolls they set on fire.

She brought out miso for my boyfriend and asked if I would like one on the house. I asked if I could get plain curry and she had to ask the chef. She came back and said yes, but it would be the same price for curry sauce on rice even if I didn&#39;t want the beef or veggies. So $18 for curry sauce on rice. I passed. I didn&#39;t want curry that badly. What I should have done was read all the reviews about the ramen before I ordered it. DO NOT GET THE RAMEN. It is instant ramen. Other yelpers have confirmed this. Mine was overcooked and too watery. Don&#39;t do it. The Philadelphia roll was fine. The mega crunch was ok. It was crunchy and tasted ok. I felt like it shouldn&#39;t have been a sushi roll (with rice.) It may be better as like a stuffed mushroom. My boyfriend had the chicken katsu curry and liked it. It&#39;s not like Japanese curry. It&#39;s not as thick. It has the curry flavor, with a lot of diced vegetables. Would not go back."

Never going back again. I live in the neighborhood too.  It was lunchtime and it was busy. Still I felt unwelcome by the server. I cannot recommend this place.

The staff are awesome and way friendly. They are very attentive and make sure you are happy with what you ordered. Especially the waitress name Mary, she is very friendly and hospitable.

I normally get the spicy ramen during lunch. I expected a small bowl when I first ordered this but to my surprise it was HUGE. It&#39;s defiantly better then cup ramen and stove top.  Bento boxes are yummy too.

I also have had their sushi and nigiri, the fist is always fresh and tasty.  So far no upsets for me. :)

They also have a little rewards card that they sign and get free items off the menu after every visit. Which is a plus!"

The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the pricing is reasonable. And during the daily Happy Hour, offered Monday through Saturday, the prices get even better! It really can&#39;t be beat.

I really enjoy the Agadashi Tofu and Takoyaki and my girlfriend loves the Shrimp Crunch Roll. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had a roll here that I didn&#39;t at least like, if not outright love.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is calm and sedate and is a great place to go on dates or for a little quiet time with your partner or alone. They&#39;re incredibly adept at dealing with groups large and small and never seem to get flustered. 

We love the food and have been frequenting Dotombori since it opened and will continue to go back."

So really, when you are in the area, its best not to get your hopes up, and we won&#39;t have any problems ! 
Anyway, after living here most of my life, I&#39;ve learned to venture out of town towards the city for sushi places because if  places like Todai is what some people consider &#34;good&#34; than I don&#39;t want to know what &#34;bad&#34; is! 

With that said, its definitely a postive note that Des Plaines now has a sushi establishment. Excited to give Dotombori a try, I stopped in to find a cute little restaurant that seats about 10 tables not including the sushi bar. I ordered a couple rolls to go- the Las Vegas roll and a Rainbow roll. The place was more than half full but I got my rolls in a jiffy. While the rolls were nothing out of the ordinary they did satisfy my sushi craving- but for a price- $20 to be exact. A tad pricey in my opinion considering the rolls did not really have that wow factor. They did have some lunch options and sushi dinners that I might consider for the next time. Overall, not bad but not great BUT I&#39;ll defintely consider this place over Todai..just sayin..."

Service was much quicker and the sushi was fresh, unique and delicious as always. I am in love with the White Dragon, OMG and Holey Moley rolls. I recommend sauce on the side if you&#39;re picky about too much sauce.

Wish they had seaweed or cucumber salad on the happy hour menu, but maybe next time ;)

Still giving those misc food receipts, but maybe some day they will catch up with technology and also allow access to their &#34;Free Wi-Fi.&#34;

All griping aside, this is the BEST restaurant I&#39;ve been to in Des Plaines. Finally a place to take my city friends!"

Prices reflect what you&#39;re going to get, especially at lunch. Plenty of &#34;Lunch specials&#34;, however the &#34;lunch&#34; rolls are always smaller than most, and sometimes don&#39;t hold up too well. The Bento Box is probably the way to go for lunch. You definitely get your monies worth, and should be full at meals end. Throw some soup or an app in the mix, you&#39;re looking at a pretty solid, filling lunch for around 10 bucks."

I forget.. the Yumyum?  Chef is very generous and had some off menu special items.  I like their appetizers too with the crab and puff.. forget the name again... It&#39;s a big crab puff.  Location is right across the train station in downtown.  Parking, I&#39;d recommend right in front or on the side street... otherwise there&#39;s garage and side parking lots from the plazas near the area and public garage parking.

NO.

it was SHIN RAMEN - the ones that come in red packaging. that you get from H-mart. whole box of 20 of these would cost $12.

i asked the owner if this was shin ramen or shin ramen black and she said, &#34;well the noodle is shin ramen. but the base is pork base. noodle is shin but base is japanese pork base.&#34; FURIOUS, i asked her if she has ever tried shin ramen and she said, &#34;no... but is it good?&#34;

i had shin ramen here and it was $9.00.

Will be back for sure. However, the service is extremely slow. A coworker and I went for lunch at 11:45 during the week. There was only 1 other table with a couple people there. It took 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order. I asked for a take out container immediately upon getting our food, since I knew I would not have enough time to eat it.  Tip for the owners and wait staff...Learn to make eye contact with your customers when you are walking around to see if they are trying to get your attention. Most people that come in for lunch during the week are on a schedule with allotted time for their lunch break...you could  potentially lose business at a prime time if more attention is not paid to your customers and their busy schedules.
I would advise anyone on a time constraint to tell them you are in a hurry the second you walk in the door."

The owners were super friendly and gave us free soup and desserts to accompany our sushi.  The thing you always look for is the freshness of the fish in a sushi restaurant and this place was definitely good.  The prices were reasonable as well!

I&#39;ve been there twice, today was the second time. First, the service is fine, but not over the top great. It&#39;s overpriced for what you get, the amount of food is average. If you order the vegetable tempura, you can expect about 5 pieces of vegetables on the appetizer plate. The tempura udon was good, but had all kinds of vegetables in it like onions, carrots, and broccoli - not typical of Japanese udon, I didn&#39;t like different vegetables and onions in it...keep in mind though, this restaurant is korean owned and managed, but only about 2 dishes are korean. sushi, is okay, but this wouldn&#39;t be my first choice. I love that its in my neighborhood, but not sure I can give it a 3rd chance. Just can&#39;t seem to walk away feeling like it was worth the money spent."

Their rice is perfect.; not too sweet, not remotely mushy.  The service is very polite and pretty good.  It is a small, quiet place, with great decor.  The sushi is very fresh with some interesting rolls.  

As an app, we had the gyoza.  It was very light with the perfect amount of ginger.  We had the salmon nigiri and tobiko.  The salmon was outstanding, with the perfect amount of wasabi.  The tobiko (flying fish roe) is green, though I prefer the orange.  I know it is just the dye, but psychologically, I prefer the orange.  It was very fresh and not over salty.  We also had the spicy tuna roll and it was excellent.  We tried two specialty rolls.  The Caterpillar was very good.  We asked for a bit of sriracha to dip.  We then tried the Viking.  We didn&#39;t love this one.  The white tuna on top is seared and we didn&#39;t love that.  Since it was our first time, they gave us a bit of the banana cake to try, and it was great.  They also have a card where you get something free every other visit.  On your tenth visit, you get a free specialty roll.

Overall, we were very pleased and will definitely be back.  It isn&#39;t cheap, but nowhere near downtown prices.  Their lunch specials and Happy Hour look extremely economical.  We recommend it for great sushi in the burbs."

I&#39;m not usually a big fan of Thai food, but after looking on Yelp, some of the dishes left me with a craving for it. It doesn&#39;t get too crowded so we were served right away too.

We ordered the big plate, spicy duck rolls, and pork pad Thai. The big plate was a great appetizer/dish to share and sample some things on the menu. The crispy salmon rolls weren&#39;t really what I expected- which was what I was most excited for- but still good. The array of sauces in this dish was awesome too- lots of different yummy flavors. I really liked the spicy duck rolls too, but beware- it is SPICY. The pork pad Thai was fresh and delicious as well.

I&#39;m pretty sure this is the only (but one of the few) Thai spots I&#39;ve tried and am willing to go back to! Some other items on the menu looked very promising too."

My 1st impression was how clean the place felt. The service was attentive and friendly and the food was pretty great. the menu is slightly Americanized and tries to be pan Asian (there was even dim sum on the menu?). it doesn&#39;t have the usual Thai names next to the English names (i.e the menu says papaya salad not sum tom next to it).... 

Anyways, I really liked the ground chicken salad (Larb) that I would get this again if I go back but I would ask for more than just medium spice. The massaman curry was great too. The seafood pad kee maw was not as spicy as I would have liked but the seafood itself was rather fresh and clean tasting.

The food came out quickly, and it was delicious!! They have a great menu, something for everyone. Pad thai, curries, other noodles and rice, chicken, duck, etc. I ordered the chicken panang curry, and it was so good! I finished the entire thing. My friend ordered a noodle dish and loved it too. They don&#39;t have a great alcoholic drink menu (a few wines), but the wines they do have taste good.

As others have said a modern decor to the interior. It feels nice and open unlike many places that have poor lighting and just feel dark and dingy. Although that might be what they&#39;re going for...

Had lunch specials so they come with little sides that IMO are 100% better than any other Thai spot. Fresh cucumber salad was great and the pot stickers we&#39;re also good. The soup is real TomYum. 

The spicy ginger w/ seafood was great. Very clean seafood, cooked right, with hot peppers. They marinade the squid so it has a nice texture &amp; not super chewy.

Also did the Pad Thai and was a big fan. Served with sprouts, ground peanuts, shredded cabbage, &amp; carrots. It had the right amount of sauce and it was not oily like so many other places. The only thing I wasn&#39;t keen on was the BBQ pork. It&#39;s a clean cutlet that they slice for you with bbq flavor on the outside. It&#39;s not bad but I might have been expecting marinaded pork pieces that I have had in so many other Thai dishes but bbq&#39;d flavored. If you think of this as well done dry cuts of pork w/ some bbq flavor you&#39;ll be ok.

Both these lunch portions were large compared to other Thai places so it&#39;s a good value for me. If I make one comment it&#39;s that the items I had could have used a bit more salt (WHAT?) I know I never say that as I hate over salted food! They do give you soy and hot sauce on the table but the flavors just needed a little boost. I will say I&#39;d rather add that have it loaded up to begin with.  

I&#39;ll be back to try other things..."

Being a major thai food lover, this was definitely not the most authentic thai restaurant.  We ordered pad thai, panang curry, and fried tofu.  The pad thai was alright, and the panang curry was decent.  However, if I wanted authentic thai food, I would not go here.  Great service!"

Waiters were attentive. My glass of water was continuously filled. 

Pot stickers were nice and crunchy. Not one bit soggy.

Blue crab fried rice was not bad. The crab was cold but the rice was hot. Weird temperature mixture. I like that they offered a fancy crab on their menu though.

I got the massaman curry. Pretty good. I just wish I had more rice because it was a big bowl of curry."

A friend had recommended that we try altThai with the assurance that they had some of the best soup around. 

The day we went in was perhaps a quieter one since the signages were not fully lit up and we infact missed it on the first go. This had us a bit anxious to begin with. Eventually we trooped in and were seated. 

Our server was quick to notice that hubby was a vegetarian and accordingly suggested dishes without meat, seafood or fish sauce. The Tom Yum Chicken soup, Papaya Salad and Curry Fried rice were all excellent. The soup especially was hot, spicy and just perfect for my achy throat. So was the Papaya Salad - Crunchy, Fresh, Spicy &amp; Lemony! 

There was a delay in the payments, since our seat was in a corner of the restaurant it seemed like we were forgotten while the rest of the staff went about wrapping up for the day. 

All things considered - great food, good service. Will be back :)"

The service is great, the presentation is great, the food tastes great. 

One irritation. If it wasn&#39;t for the following, the would have all five stars. When we order a vegetable dish, we must specify for the cooks not to put fish sauce in. Why would you put fish on a vegetable dish? This is not listed in the menu. None of the staff mentioned for several visits, until one did. That&#39;s almost dishonest. Every time I order, and specify &#34;no fish on my vegetables&#34;, it irritates me. Eventually, I will get irritated enough I find an alternative."

Everything we ordered was delicious n portions were good.
I&#39;ve dined in and carry-out. 
Dining in experience:
I love the presentation using the beets, so simple yet eye pleasing. We dined in on a Sat evening and it was surprisingly not busy but food did take awhile to prepare compare to other places. 
We ordered several dishes to share, one of them being woon sen and requested mild for the kids. 2 out of 3 kids complained dish was too spicy (you have to specify your heat level for each dish). The one that didn&#39;t complain was older n she can tolerate some heat. The adults tried the dish and thought it was fine but we believe it was bc our tastebuds were numb by the spice frm trying all our other dishes. We came to the conclusion that they messed up on the heat level of all our dishes bc the one that we requested &#34;hot&#34; wasn&#39;t as spicy as a dish that we requested &#34;medium&#34;. It wasn&#39;t a huge issue bc the flavor profile for all the dishes were on pt; was just an issue for the kids dish. We ended up ordering fried rice for them and made certain they made it mild. 
Service was ok, didn&#39;t seem very attentive. We were celebrating a bday and server said he would bring out dessert at the end and forgot, had to ask someone else. 
Carry-out experience:
They have a very good lunch special. Soup is included when u dine in but not carry-out. Portions of items not part of special seems to be smaller (imo) compared to same item ordered for dinner dine in and I believe pricing is the same. Plus u don&#39;t get the pretty presentation."

We ordered the crab rangoon, papaya salad - spicy, tom yum seafood - spicy, panang chicken - spicy, and pad see ew tofu. 

Crab rangoon was so good. I loved it. They actually had seasonings in the filling! The papaya salad wasn&#39;t as fishy as I&#39;d like it, but it was super spicy and still pretty good. I&#39;ve had the best homemade papaya salad so nothing ever comes close. The tom yum seafood was delicious. Lots of seafood and spicy. Panang chicken was too watery. It was like a soup. The flavors were good, but I&#39;m used to panang being creamier and thicker. I almost thought they accidentally brought us another tom yum. Pad see ew was good too. Even tho I usually wouldn&#39;t order tofu with any of these, I&#39;m glad I did. It made it seem lighter than it was.

Make sure you check in for a free thai iced tea! :)

For lunch you get Tom Yum soup (except me but only because I hate soup for some odd reason), eggroll or potstickers and your entrée.  The portions are so generous, I always have enough for leftovers for the next day, even without the soup.  Right now I am obsessed with the curry fried rice, medium spicy, with shrimp.  My mouth is watering even thinking about it.  Their medium is pretty spicy (and I like spicy food), so be warned.  We have tried most of the lunch items and they have all gotten the thumbs up.

Have been here multiple times with my friends and tried one different things everytime. We call it experiment on new dishes along with the pre-tasted ones. Believe me each time the experience was good.
The staff is always ready for your service and gives attention to each table properly. 

The staff properly listens to your requirement of the food and takes proper instructions as you direct. We always order only specific veggies &#34;no meat, no egg, no eggplant, no mushrooms&#34; and we have never been disappointed with any unusual dish or unwanted ingredients in the food. 

The cleanliness of the place is also very well maintained. Usually when we go out in different restaurants many times it happens that the restaurant is clean but the restrooms are not in a good condition,  uncleaned and stinky. Over here the cleanliness is very well maintained and is always clean.

 Few dishes which we loved till now:(all dishes below we ate were Vegan)

The food is Thai and Asian-fusion, and the feel is contemporary and casual. Food is excellent.  The crab rangoon appetizer is better than any I&#39;ve had elsewhere.  Pad Thai with shrimp was fresh, flavorful and not heavy-handed as some Asian restaurants tend to get.  Panang curry is out of this world, and the basil rice with chicken is also very flavorful and fresh.  It&#39;s kind of small so it fills fast on a Friday night, but don&#39;t let that deter you.

I ordered Tom Kha soup with tofu and veggie spring rolls. When the tom kha soup came out it was just broth, a few pieces of tofu, and cilantro. I inquired about the fact that there weren&#39;t additional vegetables in the soup and the waitress told me that&#39;s how it comes, but if I wanted I could add veggies for an additional charge. I said I would like to add more veggies. Nonetheless, she wasn&#39;t too friendly about my request. When my soup came back with the extra veggies, I was disappointed to see that the soup was still mostly broth-- some mushrooms were added. Not only was I disappointed with the extreme lack of veggies and tofu for a $10 soup, but the soup itself was extremely tasteless and bland. I&#39;ve had Tom Kha soup at many other Thai restaurants including having had it in my travels to Thailand. It&#39;s usually one of the most flavorful soups, which was a stark contrast to my experience at altThai. I also ordered vegetable spring rolls, which had way too much onion.

I went for carry out today. The very nice server took my order, lead me to a table, brought me a glass of water, she was very sweet. I always giggle when people complain about the service in most Asian restaurants. No how are you? Seriously? Drop a star even if the food is the best because the service was awkward? The language barrier is often difficult for people, and they&#39;re doing their best to bring you delicious food. Hope when you open your restaurant in Thailand it goes better for you. And slow service usually is the result of a &#34;slow&#34; kitchen making the food as it&#39;s ordered.

I&#39;m eating my order of Larb (ground chicken salad), which is delicous!! The spice level is perfect, and the flavors are wonderful. I also ordered noodle soup with beef balls and pork. This dish is bland, which I expected, so I added a little Sriracha which was in my bag. They packaged the broth separately from the noodles and protein, which I appreciated."

Most of you are now thinking, no sh*t Sherlock, what&#39;d you go there in the winter for? I travel every week for my job, and my most recent assignment had me visiting Chicagoland in November through January. I never seem to get a Florida assignment in the winter. :( But I digress. One cold and snowy night, I persuaded a coworker to scope out a particular Chinese bistro in Arlington Heights for dinner. Little did we know the place is closed on Mondays. So we drove around looking for someplace else Asian, and Google Maps sort of led us to altThai. I say sort of because we asked for Asian restaurants in Arlington Heights, but the map directions had us driving all around the place...it&#39;s tucked into a corner of a small  courtyard that also houses a Noodles &amp; co., a sushi parlor, an ice cream parlor, and some other businesses. Thankfully, free garage parking was available so we didn&#39;t have to park on the snowy street.

The establishment is small and intimate, softly lit. Instead of cheesy quarter-tone music, light dinner jazz played overhead. Tables are small and seat no more than four. I&#39;d guess they seat no more than 30 overall. Service was attentive without being pushy, and on both occasions we went, the server was quite knowledgeable about the food.

Because I was freezing my buns off, I started with the tom kha soup. (Note for those new to Thai food: Tom kha is the one with the coconut milk; tom yum is the broth.) Coworker went with the spinach soup with chicken balls. The serving of tom kha can be a meal by itself. Large portion, tangy, coconutty, with a variety of yummy ingredients. I had them put tofu in, but of course you can choose chicken if you prefer. When I go to a new Thai place, I always ask for medium spicy, figuring I can modulate up or down if needed. This place&#39;s &#34;medium&#34; is just a little bit on the hot side; I&#39;d give it a 6 on a scale of 0 to 10 for heat.

Curries at altThai are just sensational. On my first visit, I chose the red curry, medium spicy with tofu. A huge bowl of vegetables and tofu with a soup-like portion of  coconut gravy came my way, with white rice. Brown rice or noodles are available for an upcharge, but I feel like spicy food isn&#39;t cooled off by brown rice very well even though I know it&#39;s better for me. What a savory, mellow taste. A perfect toe-warmer!

The next time we visited, I chose the same soup but for an entree, chose the Crispy Basil Salmon. Now, that name is linguistically ambiguous; you would think &#34;crispy&#34; refers to the salmon, but it doesn&#39;t. What I received was a large salmon filet, cooked properly, with crispy basil leaves on top and vegetables to the side. Apparently they fry the basil leaves, which is a nice crunchy garnish. The best part of this dish, besides the perfect salmon, is the melt-in-your-mouth eggplant that appears in the vegetable mix. A nice foil for the spice.

Sadly, my favorite Thai dessert, mango with sticky rice, was not available this winter; my server informed me it&#39;s seasonal, which is reasonable but still disappointing. I never get any other dessert in a Thai restaurant. So, I guess I&#39;ll just have to hope my company sends me to Chicago this spring or summer, so I can enjoy another terrific meal at altThai!"

I got the HOT which was spicy but not that bad - handled by those who have had some really HOT food in Indian/Thai cuisines. This place has nice decor and service is not bad.

P.S. It&#39;s a bit difficult to find this place in the complex and parking in the night seemed difficult."

There is very little communication between the server and the customer. Every time I have dined here, the server didn&#39;t make eye contact or offer water refills. I never got a smile, a hello, a thank you, or a &#34;how are you?&#34;

I really don&#39;t have high expectations, I just like to feel welcomed. I don&#39;t feel that way when I dine here. I get that this isn&#39;t a five star restaurant, but I don&#39;t like being ignored, and brushed aside. I feel uncomfortable and rushed when I eat and it&#39;s hard to feel at home. 

Another thing is that despite the fact that I love spicy food, and can usually gauge what mild, medium, and hot mean, the food is always way too spicy for what it claims to be. I&#39;ve ordered each level of &#34;hotness&#34; and have found that the mild flavor still requires me to drink a good glass of ice cold water, the medium spiciness makes me sweat, gasp, and down several glasses of water, and upgrading to hot makes me breathe fire and gulp an entire pitcher of water. (Bring your own water so you don&#39;t have to flag down a server like I did for a simple refill.)

This is coming from someone who was raised in a Korean household and enjoys kimchi, curry, hot sauce, and hot peppers. 

If you don&#39;t have a high threshold for spicy foods, do not get anything worse than the mild option."

It&#39;s a tad out of the way for where I live (Wheeling) but it is so worth it -- just don&#39;t go at rush hour. 

Mom and I ordered wine (Sonoma something, a Chardonnay, and mom got a Pinot noir of some kind), good wine for a pretty average price.

We shared the coconut shrimp, YUM! Would order again. Also would totally order this as my main dish if it came with more than 4. 

We also shared chicken Thai fried rice and chicken pad Thai (medium spice). So delicious and we&#39;re bringing home leftovers, so excited for lunch tomorrow, lol. Both have great flavors and spices. Fresh. Love it! Probably the best Thai food I&#39;ve had in this area.

We also redeemed our free Thai iced tea for checking in, it&#39;s good! Different. Mom thinks it tastes like a creamsicle. For a free drink, why not.

The atmosphere and service are also great. There&#39;s some smooth jazz/easy listening playing right now. Our waitress was attentive and gave us good wine recommendations.

The sauce was amasing,  And it had also shredded hearts of romaine and spring onion for crunch and flavor. A light dish, but the flavor of the garlic sauce was outstanding.  Not overpowered with garlic, just a note, but the complexity and balance was perfect.  It was ideal with steamed jasmine rice."

We order on the website regularly and just repeat the same order every time.  Despite this consistent ordering, the food varies quite a bit from order to order (amount of sauce, level of spiciness, amount of veggies). Sometimes it&#39;s very mediocre but when them make it well, it&#39;s really good.  Their website is also somewhat confusing, the time they say it will be ready is frequently wrong. My wife orders it gluten free and they will frequently make both of ours gluten free. 

All that said, 4 stars but it would be 5 with more consistency."

The decor is trendy chic, which is why I found that the waiters wearing jeans to be slightly off?  I would suggest that they wear dark khakis instead.  It says business casual in a very trendy Google software-engineer kind of way..

My sister and I both had the chicken pad thai, and it was delicious.  The portion was generous.  Our water glasses were refilled constantly.  We didn&#39;t feel rushed.  The service was prompt and polite.

I&#39;d recommend the place to anyone looking for somewhere hip to eat and not looking to eat at a corporate franchise in the downtown Arlington Heights area!"

The ambiance is nice with minimal and simple decor that resembles a modern café. As for how many people this restaurant can accommodate, I couldn&#39;t  imagine a huge party eating here but rather a family of 4 or so.

It was Friday evening and it wasn&#39;t packed as I expected. There were actually a lot of tables open so in the beginning I questioned the popularity of this place. However once we received our food, I questioned why this restaurant wasn&#39;t as crowded as it should have been.

Let me start off by saying that they&#39;re very generous with the seafood content in their entrees. We had so much scallop/shrimp in our entrees that it was almost overwhelming. We tried Caribbean fried rice, basil scallop (comes with a small bowl of rice), and seafood pad Thai. Caribbean fried rice and basil scallop were our favorites. Pad Thai rice noodle was still cooked perfectly but it didn&#39;t go over my expectation in terms of taste. However, if you&#39;re a fan of Pad Thai, I advise you get it. 

Service was great and even appetizers were served hot and fresh. We were pleasantly surprised on how good the appetizers were. The chicken satay was okay however. Chicken was cooked properly but the whole overall taste with the peanut sauce didn&#39;t impress me. Probably our least favorite. But try the shrimp and calamari appetizers. 

For a group of 3, the bill came out around $75. 3 appetizers, 3 entree and a free Thai iced tea for checking in on yelp? I&#39;d say that&#39;s a pretty good price. 

I would definitely come back here again as it seems that there&#39;s a lot of people who order their meals for a pick up instead of eating at the restaurant. It might be because you get a 10% discount from ordering online. Regardless, altThai was a pleasant surprise."

It was a really big portion and really good! I had to take some home for leftovers. They also put the cashews on the side which I enjoyed because I ALWAYS forget to ask for pad thai without the cashews.

The interior of the restaurant was interesting. The shape of the restaurant is kind of odd, with a bunch of corners and walls all over, making it inconvenient to place furniture. But it looked clean and modern. The furniture kind of looked like Ikea furniture- cheap but sleek. The table had a really neat rubbery table cloth wrapped around it- you could tell it was on the cheaper side but it looked nice.

The server was nice... he was a bit timid. Overall, I&#39;d go again for the pad thai!"

The ambience is lovely, cute decor and low-key sound level. You&#39;ll be given a choice of spiciness when you order your food, so you won&#39;t be out of your depth and sweating like Hephaestus.

My go-to orders are tofu pad thai with a thai ice coffee. Oh, how&#39;d I forget! The drinks rock. Coffee is very, very good- creamy with what I think is either condensed milk or coconut milk. There are many tea options as well, including a classic matcha-based green ice tea that pairs well with the spice.

Last time I went (and I go every couple of weeks), the owner sent us a free dessert. When I asked what the occasion was, he brushed it off and said &#34;just because!&#34; That was a really nice touch- and the ice cream/fried banana were great, to boot! :)

All in all, altThai earns the 5 stars. Great food, great service. Great restaurant, I go back regularly."

For some reason they made their delivery area smaller so we fall just outside of it by 4 blocks. Since we have two little guys, hubs and I don&#39;t get out nearly as much for dinner anymore so it has been a while since we&#39;ve had altThai. 

Went yesterday for dinner with my niece for the first time in months! It was busy. There was a long table of 15 people and children everywhere. We were seated at a &#34;bar height&#34; table in the back on the other side of the restrooms. We waited 20 mins for someone to come take our order. As we waited we watched 3 separate couples walk in and get seated. Those tables had the servers take their order and we still waited. When the fourth couple showed up, got seated at the two seater table by the wine cork display, and had their order taken within 3 mins of them being seated we left. 

Doubt they noticed since we went 25 mins without any service.

Spring rolls were more sophisticated than most and loaded with fresh ingredients.
My friend had the Panang curry with fish and enjoyed it; she noted that the spice level was not dumbed down for the suburban palate.
I love crab and so had to try the crab-fried rice. It had a generous portion of blue crab, some of it stirred into the rice and the rest on top. Rice was not greasy or heavy as so many versions of fried rice are, plus there were a few more vegetables than normal.
Better than average wine list for this type of place, and the service was very good. I&#39;ll be back.
Convenient free underground parking on the same block."

Ordered everything online and when I walked in to pick up, the place was packed. It was a small space, but everyone sitting seemed happy. I was immediately greeted by a server and pointed to the carryout line. Impressed at how they already had my order after 20 minutes of ordering it online. 

Now to the food...everything was superb! I love thai food and needless to say everything we had ordered was delicious, fresh, and better than most Thai places I&#39;ve ordered from. The portions are good for 2 people.The reason I didn&#39;t give thsi place a 5 was the crab rangoon was dripping with oil when I picked it up. They also tend to make things on the spicy side, so when you order and they give u the option from mild, hot, hotter etc...you better know what you&#39;re getting into! I had to drink milk with my meal as my taste buds were on fire. Other than that, I would definitely go back to order here!"

The service is wonderful without being overbearing and the atmosphere, as a few people have said, is modern but relaxed. As for the food, between the four of us we have tried a decent chunk of the menu and have never had anything less than excellent. To start, we never ever skip the crab rangoon, and the other appetizers we have tried are great as well. Our new favorite main dish is the spicy catfish that was recommended to us by our waitress, and you can never go wrong with the massaman curry, pad Thai, or deep fried red snapper. We second the tip to order for mild, we each tried medium once and it was still delicious but a bit too much for our palates. When you have room left, go for the fried ice cream. To put it simply, this is easily the best restaurant we know of in the area, and it rivals places we&#39;ve been in the city or anywhere."

Service was great, especially in a Thai restaurant, where food  can be hit, my water was never empty.   Tried some dishes I had never had based off Yelp recommendations, they were all well done and flavorful.  Crab Rangoons were standard but the filling was very savory.  Had dim sum sampler and it was also great.  Wasn&#39;t a big fan of pad Thai my girlfriend got, which is odd, since it is normally the only thing I order.  I got that Pad Ew stuff with chicken and ordered it hot.  It was hot but not unpleasant, perfect if you like spicy food.

This is Thai food the way I like it. Straight forward preparation with authentic flavors.
Every Thai restaurant is different, isn&#39;t it? How did their mom make Mussamen Curry, or Pad See Ewe back home?
All I can say is that the flavors are spot on. Curries? A little soupy, but awesome.

I can&#39;t say enough great things about the service I received at while ordering and waiting for my food at Alt Thai, but I&#39;m certainly non-plussed that nearly 3 weeks after they changed me for Tom Yum soup that I did NOT receive, I&#39;ve still yet to have been refunded. 

It is really cute inside- great for a casual date and one of the only dining places on the block not swarmed by teens. 

The food that I did receive was underwhelming at best and the portion size of my Spicy basil w/ tofu looked like the leftover amount I&#39;d have after eating that same dish at any other Thai food restaurant. SUPER small, didn&#39;t even span the bottom of the container and the rice was obviously very not fresh. I know I came during an off-peak hour but rice that doesn&#39;t seem like it was cooked yesterday, reheated and put in a box doesn&#39;t seem like a whole lot to ask. Normally I&#39;m so excited about my Thai that I pretty much inhale it, here, even with the teeny bopper portion, I stopped a few bites in and went to work on a mega-giant wildlife puzzle I&#39;d been working on for the past few days. I finished it a few hours later figuring that the rice couldn&#39;t taste all that much more stale than it did when I got it.

I knew if I was patient enough I would find delicious Thai in Chicagoland, different from the heavy style that seems to be prevalent in the midwest.  altThai may be out in the suburbs, but it&#39;s worth it if you prefer your Thai food, lighter, less oily, and more like the Thai food in Florida and the east coast.  The restaurant is in a cute little suburban complex and the atmosphere is new, clean, and modern.

We started with the crab rangoons, which were crispy and fried well but not dripping in oil.  The filling was cream cheese, crab, and also little bits of celery and other veggies that helped give it a great texture.  The rangoons come drizzled with sweet &amp; sour sauce.

Next, I orderd the ginger tofu rice dish with brown rice and my fiance ordered the spicy basil noodles with beef.  Both were served as great portions (we both took half the meal home), and the sauce was not oily at all.  More importantly, the sauce was flavorful and tasty without being too heavy on soy sauce which seems to be the midwestern Thai style.  Light sauces, full of flavor, and fresh ingredients.  We&#39;ll be visiting altThai any time we&#39;re even remotely in the area."

Worth mentioning: last year, my best friend and I came here on Valentine&#39;s Day. altThai gave us a small plate with a few cut up strawberries drizzled with chocolate for desert. Very sweet of them.

Anyway, I brought my mom here the other day. I hadn&#39;t been here in a while and I checked up on Yelp and saw their offer/deal. I read it quickly, and when we ordered we mentioned Yelp and apparently the free soft drink is for lunch only, but he still gave it to us anyway. My mom got a Coke while I ordered a water. A few minutes later, he came around and asked if I&#39;d like to try the Thai iced tea. Say what? I thought you&#39;d never ask!

We got the big combo appetizer: highly recommended. Two of everything, great for sharing. You get stuff like the shrimp shu mai, chicken satay, and other crispy goodness. For dinner, I stuck with the familiar and got the basil chicken - hot. Delicious as always, and I noticed they changed their plates. The food used to come served on rectangular plates.

At the end of dinner, we were given complimentary mango sorbet. Yummy.

Service was a little slow; a table that got in after us was served before us; however, I can&#39;t complain. The tea and mango sherbet were much appreciated! Things like that keep me coming back - and keep me writing 5-star reviews on here. Keep it up."

I also am not a fan of how I keep having to go up to the counter to get water. Why can&#39;t they just give us jugs? It will save both the bartender and me time and the hassle. This would be especially annoying when lines form at the bar.

I was disappointed with the pizza. I guess it just wasn&#39;t for me or it may have been overhyped by my friends. It definitely was not the best thin crust I&#39;ve had, I don&#39;t even think it&#39;ll make the top five.

The only bad that I have to say was the entire layout of the restaurant. First off we were not sure if we had to seat ourselves. We didn&#39;t know we had to go to the counter and order our food and then have a seat. After ordering we sat down and didn&#39;t realize we had to go to the counter at the other end to pick up our drinks.

The food is so bad the appetizers are like some dollar store shit. The pizza is some dry ass sandpaper with sauce that was expired for over 2 years.

Not quite as good as the one in Northbrook but I might be partial I live right behind it. When I drove by and saw Barnabys I had to stop after the god awful pizza I had for lunch today.

We liked the self-serve aspect of Barnaby&#39;s; you order your own drinks and food at separate windows, are given ticket(s) and wait for your number to be called when your food is ready.

Our veggie pizza (with added sliced tomato) was a pretty good thin crust pie. We ordered the 14&#34; at $17.50 because the 10&#34; looked too small for us. The pizza came out screaming hot (too hot). All of my toppings slid off the flimsy crust; I would have had better success had I used a fork. Oh well. Most of the ingredients appeared to be fresh, except for the mushrooms. There was an up charge for fresh mushrooms. The pizza wasn&#39;t bad and the cornmeal crust was different, but the pie didn&#39;t blow my mind.

We ordered the fried veggie basket as an app ($7.50) and it wasn&#39;t anything special. The cauliflower was good, but not extraordinary enough that I&#39;d reorder. Stick to the onion ring basket or cauliflower by itself.

The older woman taking our order was not friendly, nor was she helpful. It was obvious we were new customers, but she didn&#39;t do anything to make us feel welcomed. We had some questions about how many slices come in a 10&#34; and all she could say was &#34;they&#39;re cut into squares.&#34; Fine. Ok, but you still know how many squares are cut into a 10&#34; pizza, given you&#39;ve likely worked at this joint for 20+ years. 

We also printed a $3 off $20 coupon from the Barnaby&#39;s website, but she didn&#39;t apply it to our bill. This woman was old enough to be my grandmother and old enough to know that she didn&#39;t want to to anything beyond her $8/hr. duties. (Pretty certain she&#39;s the same woman another reviewer mentioned).

I noticed a &#39;help wanted&#39; sign hanging behind her, the cashier. I hope they find someone a helluva lot friendlier than this lady. Aside from the bartender, she&#39;s the only employee you make contact with. The bartender was nice. Oh, and the woman bussing the tables was kicking butt. Kudos for non-sticky tables.

Atmosphere is totally dated, but I imagine that&#39;s part of the reason this place is so appealing. Couple of big screen tv&#39;s and they even have carpet on the ceilings. 

Paper plates, plastic utensils, no wait staff, mediocre ingredients.

We came home with half of a leftover pizza. It should feed us for another day. We spent just over $25 for two people and no tipping. Pricey to us given the overall experience.

Still up in the air as to whether or not we&#39;ll be back."

This place has a special place in my heart as I have been coming since I was a kid, and I&#39;ll likely continue to until I&#39;m in the ground. Why? Well the nostalgic atmosphere that resembles &#34;Cheers&#34; is one reason, but only 1 of many. It&#39;s all the little things like how they give you a ticket with a # on it, and you wait in utter anticipation to hear a muffled &#34;pizza 126&#34; over the loudspeaker.

Now the food! I consider this the best or close to best thin-crust pizza in Chicago. I actually don&#39;t eat the crust on most pizza I order but that&#39;s actually what makes it for me here. I think they use some sort of beer batter, and then the bottom of the pizza is dusted with cornmeal. Best. Pizza. Ever.

To get drinks, alcoholic or not, you have to go to another counter that I believe is cash-only, or was at one time. They also have good specials, and 1 or 2 TVs.

This is a great little spot for all walks of life. You can bring your family here, you can get together with some friends here, your kids, your date (just make sure it&#39;s not your first one!) etc.

At the end of it you feel full, happy, and relaxed, because stepping through those doors always seems to make me feel like I&#39;ve stepped into a simpler time with simple pleasures and makes me appreciate that.

I like to place my order while I&#39;m in the car driving over to this place since I&#39;m usually driving from the Schaumburg area. I just recently made a pilgrimage back to Barnaby&#39;s and fed 6 adults for $63 (including drinks). I love the sausage, onion and green pepper pizza. They just use the right amount of cheese on the pizza which really puts me in a happy place.

They also have a lot of different alternatives to pizza. Sometimes I get their Italian Beef sandwich during lunch. But 90% of the time I go for the ZA. Every time I bring a newbie into this place, they rave about the food. So do yourself a favor and get some pizza from Barnaby&#39;s."

I&#39;m pretty sure the place hasn&#39;t changed since it opened. It&#39;s very dark, no windows, with some weird quazi-medieval, beer hall theme. The basic cheese pizza is my personal favorite but toppings are tasty as well. Beer is crazy cheap. It&#39;s the kind of environment you need to experience to fully understand and appreciate, so just go. Just don&#39;t be expecting anything fancy or healthy."

I had ti go ask for lettuce and tomato on my grilled chicken sandwich.  I double checked menu description and it was supposed to be on sandwich.  He made up excuse they started making the lettuce and tomato and onion optional during dinner time.  Beer prices great and cold mugs.  Just need a more personable cashier and all would be better.

Every suburb has their &#34;pizza place&#34;. Sorry to all the other pizza establishments in Des Plaines but Barnaby&#39;s is the Best Pizza in Des Plaines. I&#39;ve been to all the others and none compare.

Maybe part of it is nostalgia as I remember going there after the Little League All-Star games at West Park. Maybe it&#39;s because there are no windows in there which cause temporary blindness when you walk in there on a blinding, ice-covered street day or when you exit on a bright, summer day. Not much has changed in Barnaby&#39;s which is the biggest charm of the place. The pizza?

I&#39;m a huge fan of the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza and the beer-crust which is addicting. I will say, however, that their crust is a little soggy. I guess I can ask for it crispy next time. 

Drink a draft beer out of an icy-cold mug, chow down on some pizzas and your Saturday or Sunday will be that much better. Just remember to put your sunglasses on before you head out that side door by the bar. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you..."

Perhaps it&#39;s the Tolkien-style Inn decor of the old school pizza parlors or the benches that make me feel like i&#39;m resting before i resume my adventure campaign.  Perhaps it&#39;s the stained glass. Perhaps it&#39;s the fried zucchini or the cheddar-instead-of-cream-cheese-jalapeno-poppers.

Perhaps it&#39;s the whole strips of bacon when you order that topping for your pizza.

Whole.
Strips.
Bacon.

Barnaby&#39;s rules. The beer batter crust and freshness of the ingredients is obvious in every delicious bite, and i&#39;ve never ordered anything i didn&#39;t love.  Granted they sell other things but the idea of going there and not ordering a pizza just doesn&#39;t register. Along an order of something fried and a cold pitcher of brew with frosty mugs to kill the time while your pie is slowly coming along and i tell ya, i&#39;m smiling just thinking about it.

Be especially careful of running into the Barnaby&#39;s trademark post in other cities (south bend). It is emphatically NOT the same."

I went to this location on Saturday, January 23, 2016 around 5:00. They had the most archaic system. I waited in line at least 20 minutes to order a pizza. Then you have to go to the drink line to pick up drinks, where I waited 30 minutes! There was only 1 woman who was slowly working the drink line. It didn&#39;t matter if you were getting beers, pop, or water, you had to wait in this line.  If they can&#39;t keep up, why not install a fountain pop dispenser where people can pour their own. So, by the time I was done waiting in line, my pizza had been done. In addition, they don&#39;t deliver the pizza to your table so you have to go up to the counter to pick it up. Had the pizza been good, like Arlington Heights or Northbrook, I wouldn&#39;t have complained as much, but it wasn&#39;t. In addition it is extremely outdated and needs an overhaul. This location should be closed or new management brought in. Definitely the most inefficient system I have ever encountered."

I found it ok, but I might find it better if I lived nearby and didn&#39;t know there were a lot better places for pizza in other towns or the city. The place itself leaves something to be desired, though I did kind of like being able to hide in the corner in this dark place. The pizza was ok, nothing special. I didn&#39;t really like the ordering and pickup method they have going there. It felt like I was in what a film student would create if they were told to make a German cafeteria. I&#39;d give it another try I guess, but I&#39;m not tripping over myself to get there."

I wanna start with some of my earliest memories. When we were kids we would stand on our tippy toes to look through the glass to watch the guy make the pizzas.  This seemed like more fun then eating the pizza.  It was so cool to stand there and watch the cook and wonder is that our pizza? Recently I was able to show my little one the pizza being made but I don&#39;t think she was as amazed as I was as a kid. I&#39;m gonna blame technology and the iPhone for stealing this innocence.  I still think its cool. 

Time has changed for this once successful family pizza chain. Sadly there are only 6 locations still around and only 3 in Illinois (including this one).  I hope that at least these locations are able to survive.  

I must say one thing about the pizza! The thin crust is amazing here. I believe it is a corn bread crust because it is so crispy. I also love how they twist the ends of the crust almost like a braid.  I even taste a little sour in the crust like a sour dough bread.  I will say that there crust is the most unique thing about this pizza.  Dare I say I like the crust here because nobody likes the crust anywhere!

Ordering is interesting here. You go to the counter and place your order. You can also pre-purchase your pitchers of beer here but you have to go to the bar to pick them up. The person behind the register gives you a number and you have to listen for that number.  When they call your number...it means your food is ready and you go back up there to pick it up.  Very easy...no need for any servers here!

The interior is really dark, in fact there are no windows here, which adds to the mystic of this place. I love the dark wood booths plus a group of 8 can sit in two booths right next to each other which is what we typically do.  There are also TV&#39;s scattered around, so if there is a game on you can watch it. 

I also have a Barnaby&#39;s jingle burned in my brain!  &#34;After the game, after the show, all dressed up, no where to go, come to our place, make it your place, for great pizza and more, Barnaby&#39;s in Schaumburg!&#34; Why is this stuck in my head? Well when I was in my 20&#39;s I directed and edited a TV commercial and had to listen to that song for a week plus.  Every once in a while I will call my old cameraman and sing the jingle on his voicemail. We will have a good laugh plus the jingle is stuck in his head for weeks!  I may have to call him today!

What does all of this have to do with my review?  I guess I am just trying to show how much this pizza place has been a part of my life and it would be sad to no longer have a Barnaby&#39;s around.  I hope future generations appreciate the pizza and the charm that this location has. It is sad to see how many of these locations have closed over the years but I&#39;m glad to see a few are fighting strong. Keep it up!!!"

You have a variety of food to choose from (pizza, burgers, etc), you put your order in at the front, and they call your name when it is ready. You pick your own seat (it&#39;s a pretty big place), and they take your plates for you when your are finished. It has an older feel to it, but in a good way. It&#39;s sort of dark (I wish it was a little lighter), but it adds to the atmosphere. We ended up ordering a pizza - they only have a small or large, nothing in between. A large ended up being enough for 2 of us (we did take a few pieces home). The crust was thin and crispy, and it came out piping hot. It had just enough sauce, toppings, and cheese. I actually thought it was pretty good! I don&#39;t know if I would consider it one of my favorite places, but it is different and they do have good pizza!"

The delicious thin crust, amazing cheeses, and the order of fried cauliflower that we had?  My god!  It was just divine.

There is plenty of parking outside, though parking really isn&#39;t something you have to worry about in the Chicago suburbs.. and even though the restaurant is dark and older, it&#39;s very clean and well maintained.  Looked just like it did when I was little.

The part I&#39;d like to also throw in - I&#39;m west of Gurnee. We will literally drive the 40 miles here JUST for pizza. That alone should explain how good it is.

Took 45 min to get q pizza, had to pay an extra $2.50 to get pop refills and ate on old school paper plates.  I can say I did it but won&#39;t go back in the future.

The food is actually quite good, but the service has been consistently poor the last 5 times we&#39;ve been there. 

Long story short: 

They had a promotion 1/2 off all dine in orders. We ordered lots of food, that&#39;s how we are. When I asked for a to-go container THE OWNER explained she could only give me 1 container due to the current promotion, &#34;That&#39;s why you ordered so much food because of the promotion&#34;... YIKES!

We have been patrons of Barnaby&#39;s since the  70&#39;s! My entire family goes there (more than 50 people) and we order A LOT!! We always come home with boxes and boxes of left overs and this is the FIRST time we&#39;ve ever saved money due to a promotion!! The nerve of this lady to imply that we would only buy in abundance when the food is on sale!

What&#39;s worse? When I explained that I took offense to her comment because we&#39;ve been patrons for so long, her answer was &#34;I didn&#39;t mean it offensively&#34;. That&#39;s it, no &#34;I&#39;m sorry if it came across that way...&#34; or  &#34;you&#39;re a long time customer and I would hate to offend you...&#34;  NOTHING. 

Niles. Schaumburg. Northbrook. That&#39;s a list of suburbs where you will find another Barnaby&#39;s. I recommend Northbrook, it has the best food and excellent service."

It had been a while since having Barnaby&#39;s and was so looking forward to it.  

I can&#39;t even bring myself to give them 3 stars (which is what I found this particular pizza to be) bc I just love this place for so many reasons other than the pizza.  Reality is the pizza could have had a bit more sauce and cheese, simple fix. 

Apart from that it is seriously some of the best pizza around, housed in the most awesome Bavarian, Old World style building, straight from the 70&#39;s."

The burger and sticks come up right away (as usual)...25 mins go by and and still no pizza. I go up and ask and they say &#34;oh here&#39;s the ticket here, it was never put it. we&#39;ll put it in now and &#34;rush&#34; the order. It&#39;ll be about 12 mins&#34;....20 MINS later, as im walking up to the cashier to get my $ back the pizza is ready. I refuse to take the pizza b/c i had some where to be in 10 mins. 

Not at any point did someone say &#34;sorry&#34; offer a discount or even a refund until i demanded it. 

NEVER ever going back to this location. I&#39;ll stick with Schaumburg Barnaby&#39;s. Plus this location has Pepsi products *gag*"

I&#39;m not opposed to updating my review, either. A lot of people will probably disagree and think I don&#39;t know jack about pizza because I&#39;m from MN. But I know when I like something and I didn&#39;t like this.

The pizza was bland. Bland, bland, bland. I couldn&#39;t even tell that I was eating a pizza with pepperoni because the meat had no zest. Everything simply melted together to form one ginormous round pizza of nothingness. Even the crumbled cheese and seasoning couldn&#39;t save it.

We had a thin (thinner?) crust pizza, so perhaps they have regular dough or create deep dishes that outshine our order. I don&#39;t know. All I know is that the crust tasted as if it were a couple sugar sprinkles away from becoming a sugar cookie. What&#39;s up with all the saw dust on the bottom of the pizza? I understand you want to keep it from sticking to the oven and the pans, but I found myself wiping off my hands every few moments simply from whatever fairy dust they deemed fit to coat the bottom of the pizza with."

Pros- The food was actually very tasty and affordable. For two meals with an appetizer and sodas our total came to just over $20.00. I was able to use the coupon found on their site to reduce the bill by $3.00. They also had a considerable number of options although it was lacking in vegetarian choices. 

Cons- We dined in and they only had plastic silverware. It was also weird eating there because there weren&#39;t any windows and the lighting was far too dim. The staff was also a little dismissive and although all of the other patrons knew how to order it was a complicated process that confused both me and my friend (You place your order in one location, pick up drinks in another, sandwiches in a different place, and pizzas in a forth location). 

Overall I don&#39;t think I would go back for dine in services but all of my complaints are nullified by ordering take out. My suggestion: Call ahead and take the food to a more enjoyable location and enjoy!"

The first time I tried it I was hooked.  They make their own pizza dough and homemade tomato sauce daily.  But not only do they have pizza but they have sandwich and side order galore.  I love my fried foods and this place makes it happen for me.  Fries, onion rings, veggie baskets, jalapeno poppers, and mozzarella sticks.  Want soup?  They got it.  Want homemade chili?  They got it (in sesason).

Not in the mood for pizza?  Try their burgers (cheese extra) BBQ beef, beef/sausage sandwiches, homemade meatballs, or the parmesan, charbroiled, and BBQ chicken.  Like fish (from the sea, people)?  They have that too.  I like the fish &#39;n&#39; chips, but they also have fish sandwich, a catfish basket, a shrimp basket and a seafood basket.  The seafood basket comes with fried catfish, filet of cod and shrimp with tartar sauce, cocktail sauce and your choice of hush puppies or fries.  Order them with a pickle or for an extra buck or two get it with homemade coleslaw and fries.  You want pizza but the kids don&#39;t?  Whatever...  They have a 12 and under menu.  Not only do all of the items come with fries they are all under $3.00.

They have beer and soda on tap along with bottled Corona and Sharp&#39;s non-alcoholic beer.  Like wine with your cheese (pizza) they have Chablis, White Zinfindel, and even Burgundy by the glass or carafe.  My kids like the pink lemonade but they also have oj, apple juice, brewed iced tea for you non-carbonators.

My husband likes this place too but would always complain about the cash only policy.  When he had no cash on hand I would stare out the window and wave as we passed by.  Well now they accept credit/debit.  So no more excuses spouse o&#39; mine, let&#39;s go eat."

I&#39;ve been known to take down a whole pizza (or two) by myself. 

The weird thing is that even amongst other Barnaby&#39;s restaurants (Schaumburg, IL) this one has the best tasting pizza.

Everytime I&#39;m in the area I grab a &#39;par-bake&#39; (partially baked, so you can cook it at home) pizza to take to my family 3 hours away and I immediately reclaim my position as favorite child."

when the food is this good, sitting on a crate in an alley is all that you need and anything else better is gravy. Yes its dark, the decor hasn&#39;t changed since day one, but neither has the food and that&#39;s all that matters.

Needless to say I got hammered and woke up the next day nursing a major hangover.

We got up sometime in the early afternoon and we were not ready to face cleaning up the mess, my friend suggested we go to Barnaby&#39;s to line the old stomach.  We got some kind of deluxe and that pizza tasted so good to this wasted young man.

20 years later, I noticed a Barnaby&#39;s near my place of work in Des Plaines, and it brought back memories of that hazy New Years day so long ago.  I decided to stop in and see if the pizza was really all that good or was I just messed up from cheap rot gut and evil herbs.

I&#39;m glad to say that the pizza is still top flight, I ordered what was called a &#34;belt buster&#34;.  The pizza was a top notch thin crust pizza, unusual in that it is not only thin, but also crunchy as well, kind of reminded me of Home Run Inn crust.  Sauce was pleasant and added to the flavor of the pizza.  Toppings were a bit on the skimpy side but not terribly so.  

The restaurant still has that 70&#39;s look.  Thick dark wood picnic tables with solid chairs.  Place gave the impression of being dirty but it really wasn&#39;t.  But it was dark and probably would have been smokey if it hadn&#39;t been for a smoking ban.  As you can guess, the darkness comes from weak lighting and the fact that the place has no windows.  Just one big screen TV on one side of the wall to watch the games on.  Cooking area is wide open and you can watch them make your food.  Pizza area is on one side, grill in the middle and the bar on the other side.  No service, just order what you want and pick it up when your name is called.  Nice friendly staff, fat middle-aged people who seem to like where they work and eat their own cooking.

The dark atmosphere may make the place seem hostile but I highly recommend it for their thin crust pizza.  Sandwiches and things look good too although I have not had the privilage of trying them."

It&#39;s a bit of a drive for us since we live in Portage Park, however, hands down, it&#39;s worth the drive EVERY SINGLE TIME. Their pizzas never disappoint. The make the best and crispiest thin crust pizza. Fresh ingredients and the pizzas are made to order. You can actually stand by the window and watch them make and bake your pizza - one of the things our 4 years old loves to do. There are no waitresses, which saves on the cost as well. You place your order and pick it up at the window once it&#39;s ready....no frills. When we first went there, I told my husband that I feel like we are in a Robin Hood movie - from the wooden tables and chairs to the chandeliers and dimmed lights, it feels like out of this world. It&#39;s also a very family friendly restaurant so if your kids are just a bit louder, that&#39;s ok. I have seen many birthday parties happening there. Barnaby&#39;s is also VERY affordable. Last time, we ordered 3 pizzas and 1 greek salad and it was approx. $50 - can&#39;t beat that price. 

All in all, it&#39;s a great family restaurant with delicious, fresh pizza (and other foods) that is wallet-friendly. I would recommend it to anyone and have friends who will drive for 1.5 hrs. (each way) once a week to have their pizza."

I was looking for the good, and AUTHENTIC one in the Northwest burbs. City has so many great Mexican Mom and Pops shops, but burbs are full of artificial Mexican wannabes. Not this place. Modest, simple interior, behind the counter charming, super nice girl ready for your order ( I was always taking carryout, so I don&#39;t know how the dine in experience is, but I&#39;m sure it is nothing short of great). Food is ready super quick, and damn...it is good! So far I tried their steak tacos, pastor tacos, and chile relleno tacos, all amazing ( My favorite el pastor, perfection!!!),  served whatever way you want- they will ask you about the tortilla choice and topping choice. I always go with corn tortilla and cilantro for toppings. I also tried their mexican chicken rice soup, served with the choice of tortillas ( I took flour ones here, and they taste homemade, amazing), and pozole, served with crispy warm tostada. Both great, just like my Mexican friends&#39; grandma would make. Salsas are very tasty, green milder, and red spicy, both so delicious!
I can&#39;t wait to try their other foods. They have plenty of selections, so I am very excited. With the prices being very fair, I know I will be back to OK Burrito many many times, come rain or come shine :-)"

The people were friendly and they&#39;re open til 10 which is a plus, but at least as far as my food went (steak tacos with onions and cilantro) I didn&#39;t care for my tacos.  I even tried moving the filling onto some tortilla chips i had at home but i ended up throwing away most of my food.  No real flavor, the tortillas weren&#39;t very good, etc.  A shame because of it&#39;s location and they were friendly, but I don&#39;t see me going back here again.

However, in the meantime my wife fell in love with the steak burrito here, so I was dragged back the other day. In my last review when I said the meat was flavorless I meant to say steak as that&#39;s all I&#39;ve had. 

When I went back I opted for an Al Pastor burrito. This time....the meat had flavor. Their Al Pastor is pretty good. I haven&#39;t had a lot of Al Pastor so I can&#39;t compare it to too much, but it&#39;s definitely a better choice than the steak. Paired up with the sauces (I recommend the milder red sauce with the Al Pastor) and this was a pretty damn good burrito. I&#39;m still not sure why the burrito has to have 2 cups of iceberg lettuce in it, but the flavors were much more pronounced on this visit. 

Thanks to my wife I will be back again, and maybe next time I will venture away from the burritos. STAY TUNED!"

This place is basically a small Mexican restaurant in a strip mall. Nothing fancy. I asked the girl at the counter how long they had been open and she told me a little more than a month.

The place was clean, service was friendly but was a little slow. I ordered three different burritos. Steak and Al Pastor were the choices, but the one steak burrito had very specific instructions (picky coworker)
I watched them make the burritos since the kitchen is open behind the counter. They got the order out correctly. We all judged the burritos to be pretty good.

Sounds like the reviewer Sean did not have the most pleasant experience, but I would give them another go.

I will admit that I was somewhat excited when they opened this place so close to my work.. but now I wish this place was never opened in the first place as my stomach has still not fixed itself.  First problem is no one here speaks English, that would likely help you be successful in the business world.  It took about 5 minutes for them to understand my order of taco dinner with cheese and lettuce, and when I finally got my food, it was wrong - but I was hungry so I said &#34;fuck it&#34; and bit into my taco.  Gross.  The meat was gray and tasted old and I&#39;m not even sure if it was actually beef.  I went with my brothers in laws and they both ordered the same burrito and chips and salsa.  The chips were massively overpriced , almost 5 bucks - What a joke!  They were also stale and the salsa tasteless.  They brought out one burrito and a plate or rice that no one ordered.  About 10 minutes later a person came out and took our receipt and left.  Never returned , never explained what was going on.  Finally after 30 minutes my brother in law went up to the counter and they accused him of eating the burrito and saying that he never got it.  He asked for his money back and they gave him $7.00 (not even sure what the burrito cost, but whatever) - All and all, I ate a half a taco and got a killer stomach ache.  Overall this place blows and I expect it out of business before the end of the year,  Any one that truly says this is good Mexican food doesn&#39;t have a clue of what it actually is to eat and enjoy great Mexican food, instead of this overpriced , tasteless garbage!"

It&#39;s the way to go when ordering from Domino&#39;s. I always had this bad stigma associated with Domino&#39;s pizzas for some reason - their pizzas are overly greasy and taste really processed. Perhaps that&#39;s the case with their regular pizzas but the handmade pizzas...Well....they&#39;re handmade!

I was able to score a free pizza last week with a MLB promotion and ordered away. I am not a big pizza fan because I don&#39;t like tomatoes but they had the genius idea to offer their pizza sans sauce! You can of course replace the tomato sauce with white sauce or BBQ but to have no sauce...makes me so happy! And helps me pretend like I&#39;m eating slightly more healthy.

Great thing about Domino&#39;s is watching the progress if you order online. Cool little feature! &#34;Sean put your pizza in the oven at 6:19.&#34;

The guys at this location called me to make sure I had correctly ordered my pizza. No sauce weirds people out I think...he quadruple confirmed with me it was what I wanted.

I had mushrooms &amp; ham on my sauceless pizza and man was it delicious! Made me rethink my whole not liking pizza mantra I stick by. I would absolutely order a pizza of theirs again! Plus a medium size easily makes 3 meals for me! And that&#39;s three meals with me being stuffed."

Garlic butter crust. Nice! Every since they modified the menu item the pizza taste a lot better almost rivaling papa john. The hand toss pan pizza has a nice crunch to the crust.

I live near this one.  I stop there regularly for a grilled chicken sandwich, the yogurt and some iced tea.   I may have to stop that routine.

The employees at this location are not terribly friendly with a few exceptions.  Also, I would have to agree with Sarah S.   There are BIG problems with accuracy.  This morning I was there and wanted to try that steak and cheese mcmuffin.  The person seemed very confused as to what I wanted despite the fact that there is a HUGE picture of it on the menu board.  She asked if I wanted the biscuit (no, the mcmuffin, just like the sausage and egg mcmuffin you&#39;ve been serving for decades - this isn&#39;t that hard).  Finally, get my meal.  Two tiny strips of bacon instead of steak.  

There is a digital readout on the menu board for a reason.  This is supposed to make it fool-proof.  Cmon, get it together!!  This shouldn&#39;t be that hard.  The franchise owner really needs to get his team together.  Hurts McDonald&#39;s brand."

I have been to this location before, and have never had great service. This particular time I went through the drive thru while it was very slow. My last experience here, I ordered French fries and was very disappointed to discover that they were cold and dry. I drove off with them because I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal about it. On this occasion, I requested fresh fries and even offered to wait for them. Keep in mind, my WHOLE order was for two fries and a drink. I received my fries without a wait so i decided to try them first. As expected, they were cold and dry. I then parked my  vehicle and went inside to request a new order as mine were cold and dry. I was very polite and kind, as I am in customer service myself and I know how customers can be rude. I spoke to the Manager I believe (wearing a white shirt). He was very rude and condescending. When I requested a new order and explained my situation, he told me that the fries looked fine to him with an attitude. I told him that they were cold and dry and for him to try them himself. He opened the bag and looked at them and threw them away. He then walked away swearing under his breath while rudely talking about me in spanish to other employees. He then made a fresh batch, and I watched him douse them in salt. I could not believe the attitude from him. I am a General Manager myself and if he was an employee of mine, he would be fired on the spot. I understand we all have bad days, but I literally was told I was wrong, and he cursed about me to other employees literally right in front of me. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EMPLOYEE. DATE OF VISIT 05/29/2016 TIME 7:50ISH. The worst part is I live right by Randhurst and there is a Mcdonalds across the street and I always drove out of my way to this one. NEVER AGAIN!"

But let me tell you - this one actually made enough of an impression for me to add it to the Yelp directory. I don&#39;t know if I just luck into stopping by on their good days, but lately the folks working here have been the friendliest McDonald&#39;s employees that I&#39;ve ever encountered. The negative nellies can probably view this as more of a sad reflection of the general fast food industry, but I am struck by the regular presence of SMILES here. I know, crazy. And the last time I went through the drive-through, someone who wasn&#39;t even serving me asked how I was doing! I replied in kind, although to be honest, I felt a little silly doing it. On a different occasion, the guy taking my order tried to save me some money by offering a double fish filet sandwich instead of the two fish sandwiches that I asked for. My order was for two people, so that wouldn&#39;t have worked out all that well...but the thought was nice.

As for the food itself, it&#39;s predictable. Of course, that should be expected, but it&#39;s still a positive because I&#39;ve had my share of surprises elsewhere. Now, I have unfortunately received some overcooked fries, but I&#39;ll choose that any day over undercooked sogginess. The only relative downside to this place is the location. Its property is a little cramped, and some customers don&#39;t like to follow the &#34;drive around the building to get to the drive-thru&#34; rule; I almost lost a side mirror while leaving the lot because some pleasant young lady aggressively attempted the shortcut of entering the drive-thru lane via the exit. Chicken McNuggets are a hell of a drug.

I&#39;m probably sounding like I eat way too much fast food. I really don&#39;t. At least I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t. Okay, maybe I do. Damn it, it&#39;s hard to plan meals for one! Don&#39;t judge me!"

The rest of our food was very good. Their shrimp is delicious and, while it takes me forever to get the meat out, the crab was tasty. If you are not a pro with crab, I recommend getting something to munch on in-between breaking the crab meat out...

The prices are pretty good, and the specials on Mondays and Tuesday&#39;s look like good value (we had something off the regular menu but will be back for the endless shrimp!).

I got the fresh Atlantic salmon grilled, and loved every bite. I also tried the seafood bake with linguine which was also very tasty. The cheddar biscuits were amazing, especially when warm. The calamari for appetizer was also perfect for a group of 6 to share. I especially liked that there were fried veggies among the calamari as well. The ranch dipping sauce that came with the marinara sauce was also a smart take on the dish. 

For dessert, the warm chocolate lava cookie was to die for. A warm buttery rich cookie with cool and creamy ice cream on top was the best combination known to mankind. The perfect way to end the meal! A great chain experience overall! Left way too full."

Then we order and our waiter brings the first round of shrimp, it was delicious right. Well we ordered our second round and it was terrible,my shrimp scampi we&#39;re over cooked and rubbery. I said well maybe that was a bad bunch... I then ordered fried shrimp that taste like they seasoned it with a lot of sea salt. I was done at this point. Seemed to me I could be wrong that they were making them any kind of way so you wouldn&#39;t order more...that was my first thought.

I stopped coming back then because no matter what you got it all tasted the same...it all had a fishy taste.  Through peer pressure we thought we would give it a try.  Now my wife and Mother-in-Law have been here before but new for me.

My Mother-in-law had the Dueling lobster tails but substituted the Rock Lobster for a Main  because when she had it last time it was tuff.  They substituted without issue.  My wife had the build your own and she got the scallops and the salmon.  Both enjoyed their meal.

Now for me, after all, it&#39;s my review.
5 for the service 
4 for the food.

first of all the cheddar rolls were pretty damn good.  For my entree I had the Seaport Lobster &amp; Shrimp.  The skewered shrimp and the scampi tasted the same to me.  not the scampi I&#39;m used to having like in high end restaurants. Shrim in garlic butter, that&#39;s pretty much it, but it was still very good.  The lobster portion of the meal was OK too, but just OK.  Maybe its the butter they use.  Bottom line, it was still pretty good.

The waitress was very accommodating, funny and very pleasant.  My bad that I didn&#39;t remember her name to mention here but we did tell the manager that she did an excellent job.

We will come back and I think I&#39;m going to try the Wood-Grilled Lobster, Shrimp, and Salmon.  That would have been my second choice over the Lobster and Shrimp."

For me...omg. the worst burger. Meat was stale. I had to saw into the bread. Overcooked. I did not complain as my friend wanted seafood and I hate seafood. I am never setting a foot in here again. Fries portion was meager at the most maybe it was the plating but I am never coming back no matter who in my party wants to come here. My friend paid.

Lastly, after 20 minutes of looking over the menu without him checking to see if we were ready, he tells us to absolutely not order the dish we wanted with no other suggestions... I could not believe what I was seeing and hearing.

In addition, when we asked another waitress her opinion of a dish, she said I don&#39;t know let me ask around.. walked around the restaurant asking everyone and came back 3 times with different answers. Also would not take her hand off my shoulder while talking each time.

Our server Casey was helpful, timely and enthusiastic. The host staff got my mom and I seated promptly. That was all good and the positive side of the visit. But the food just isn&#39;t good, plain and simple. 

The cheddar biscuits were fine and the salad had a good taste as well. But my mom ordered a Seaport special - shrimp scampi, skewered shrimp and a lobster tail. Maybe it&#39;s the way they prepare it, but off of these items will slide out of their shells when it&#39;s cooked properly. Not one shrimp came away from the tail without the meat remaining intact with the shell. At finer seafood restaurants, the server can take a fork and cleanly separate the lobster tail meat from its shell. Here it takes two hands wearing rubber gloves to pull it apart.

I ordered cod as I used to enjoy scrod at a restaurant I worked at in the 80&#39;s. It was broiled, topped with a little paprika and served with lemon butter sauce that was light and flavorful. Well, this cod showed little sign of broiling, probably because there was a thick lemon butter sauce all over it. Had I realized it would have been that much, I would have ordered it SOS. Instead, the meal itself was more of an &#34;SOS&#34;!

I had two Darden gift cards and it was between this place and Season&#39;s 52. The latter was truly my first choice, but Mom (who&#39;s 86) and I had been out for awhile and I really didn&#39;t want her to be in a restaurant too long, so I thought we&#39;d be in and out of RL faster than Season&#39;s, which was probably a good call. Mom also used to enjoy RL so I thought for her to go there after a 15 year absence and me, probably 25 was a good thing. But it wasn&#39;t - the seafood is simply sub par. 

Rarely do I give a place with good staff a rating of less than 3 stars, but this was an exception - &#34;meh, I&#39;ve experienced better&#34; is truly my outlook on the food we had there."

Every one of them that I have tried here in Chicago is incredibly different than the experience I had with them in Texas. Original Pancake House, IHOP, and Olive Garden I&#39;m looking at you. The meal prices are at least $5-6 more expensive, seriously, and the food quality is awful. I don&#39;t understand how it could be so different being essentially the same place yet here we. The cheapest meal we could find on this menu was the $17 (per person) four course meal. It came with their cheddar bay biscuits, of course, along with soup, salad, entree, and a dessert. For $17 I could have gone down the street to my favorite Italian restaurant the Rosebud and been at least happy with my food. 

The biscuits were the only thing I liked. For the soup I had chicken tortilla which was watered down and flavorless at best. The salad was limp and nothing special, mostly iceberg lettuce and chunks of tomato. I ordered the garlic grilled shrimp which were rubbery and came on a bed of wild rice pilaf (good) and roasted seasonal vegetables (also good). My dessert was caramel cheesecake that was so tiny it could fit nicely in the palm of my hand and tasted like the cheap variety pack cheesecakes you can get from any grocery stores freezer section.

For what we spent it was not worth it. I do not see us dining again here anytime soon, if ever. We will stick to mom and pop places, or at least were the menu price is accurate for the quality of food you are getting."

But my wife&#39;s friends chose the place for their monthly lunch and I tagged along. 

This was the first time I ever ate lunch at RL.  The full dinner menu is available along with some smaller meals that are only served until 5 PM.  I ordered the shrimp tacos from those selections.  They were excellent!  Others ordered different lunch specials and a few people ordered full dinners.  Nobody had any complaints about the food. 

The service was quite good considering that we had a group of 10 people and all entrées were cooked to order.  Everything came out of the kitchen at the same time and were the proper temperature. Good work! 

The dining room was sparsely populated at the height of the lunch hour.  I suspect that this is because fresh seafood takes time to prepare and the lunch crowd doesn&#39;t have sufficient time to wait.  Ah, the joys of retirement! 

I do note that the decor has changed since my last visit - it would have to as it has been 15 years or more since my last visit.  RL always used to have a very nautical theme.  The nautical touches are still there, but much subtler.  It has a classier feel than previously. 

One complaint.  I ordered a side salad with my meal.  While I have seen skimpy side salads, I have never seen one as uninspired as this one. It was just a mess of chopped iceberg lettuce with chopped (not sliced) cucumber, two small cherry tomatoes and two small croutons.  This was the same formula for everyone&#39;s salad.  This is the reason for a 3-star review. I would have otherwise given four stars."

We called at 6 for 7pm reservations on a Saturday and the hostess Lexie (I think) was very nice over the phone and took out reservation. While there was a small wait we went to the bar and the bartender John was swamped but came to us rather quickly and even offered to make my drink even though it was not on the menu. We got to our table and our server Marcela was amazing and kind and never forgot anything and kept our drinks filled. Over all just a wonderful experience :)

I haven&#39;t been to Red Lobster in a few months &amp; it sounded pretty tastey.   We arrived around 4 p.m. &amp; we thought it would be crowded but it wasnt.  I enjoy it better when the restaurant isn&#39;t too crowded.  

We were seated &amp; the waitress took our drink order.  About a minute later the waitress came back with our Iced teas &amp; the Cheddar Bay Biscuits which are one of my favorites.  The Cheddar Bay Biscuits are the absolute best bread I have had at any restaurant.  

Next we got an order of stuffed mushrooms.  The mushrooms were pretty good as well.  They came out nice &amp; hot just how they should be.  

For our main course we got the Ultimate Feast &amp; the Admiral Feast cause that&#39;s how I roll.  The Ultimate feast was the more pricey of the two but it had crab legs &amp; shrimp &amp; it was absolutely delicious.  The Admirals Feast looked like something fit for a king or an admiral.  It had scallops, shrimp &amp; a lot of other items as well.  

I took about three bites &amp; was full because I had so many Cheddar Bay Biscuits &amp; my entree came with a Caesar Salad.  The Caesar Salad was surprisingly good.  I usually don&#39;t like salads but this was tastey.  

All together with tip our meal was about $70.  This is better than what it would have been at most other seafood restaurants.  

The one thing I don&#39;t get about Red Lobster is that while it may be a good deal compared to other seafood restaurants it is still pricey but the customers in here all look like something off of the Jerry Springer show.  I would think that the customers would be a little more well dressed &amp; classier.  

Overall the food here was really good.  The restaurant was pretty clean &amp; the waitress was nice.  I would eat here again if I was in the area &amp; in the mood for seafood."

For a Sunday afternoon it was very empty (Da Bears), originally we were going to be seated in one of those mini booths - ah NO..... I asked for a regular booth and the hostess promptly seated us in one. The server timely asked us about drinks and an appetizer and gave us time to look at the menu and brought us the crab cakes. I&#39;ve seen some negative comments about the clam chowder but I enjoyed it (no bacon), though with my mahi mahi, while good, the server gave me a cesar salad instead of a dinner salad like I asked, plus she forgot my fiancee&#39;s string beans altogether even though she reminded her of them.

The entrees were good (brought to our table by a different server) and our regular server was quick to refill our drinks (ice tea). All in all a good experience, the server made a few mistakes and with it not being busy I kind of felt like one mistake maybe, but two irked me a little bit.

The total bill was $70 and with my $25 gift card brought it down to just under $50 including tax - now normally I always tip on the original total of the bill and not the price with the gift card, but with the server&#39;s mistakes I tipped 20% of the $50."

A nice trip down memory lane of my childhood in the 1980&#39;s, the classic menu items are still the same.  Just give me the biscuits, fried shrimp, baked potato loaded with sea salt, and I&#39;m as happy as a clam!  

Just don&#39;t give me the clam chowder...

I&#39;ve been at this location about a dozen times, and have no complaints.  Subtracting a star because I hate the layout of this particular Red Lobster (part of their standard layouts at many locations across the nation), bar is in the middle, with an open floor plan to the dining areas surrounding the center of the building.  I prefer the old-school sectioned off mini-rooms without an emphasis of the bar.  Not that I don&#39;t like my libations, but that&#39;s not why I go to Red Lobster.

With fears that Red Lobster will no longer exist in a couple of years, I plan on frequenting this location at least once a month.  I suggest you do the same and stop listening to the bashing of Red Lobster for being a poor disgrace of a seafood restaurant!  Enjoy the reheat-in-a-bag entrees of shrimp, crabs, and stuffed mushrooms that are shipped from a warehouse in Taiwan, and just be happy for the final memories of crappy, yet comforting food, that are offered at the 10 dollar price point."

Went here on a Friday night.  This location is down the roads, a bit away from Woodfield Mall.  However, I swear everybody must&#39;ve seen the same commercials and had the same idea!!
It was early dinner time, around 5:30 pm.   I thought it had a descent size parking lot, but it was so hard to find a parking spot.  After driving around and around for a bit, we finally got one way in the back.

Walked in and signed up for a table for 2.  We were told it would be a &#34;quick 30 minute wait.&#34;  (Yes, I snickered at that comment.)    Thankfully, there were a few benches around.  

The best thing about Red lobster is.... the picture menus!!  I have to stress how important that is for me.  I love to have a picture or some kind of image of what I&#39;m about to eat.  

I ordered the glazed salmon with teriyaki grilled shrimp over rice with mash.  My plate was  priced at $18.  Not a bad price for seafood.  The hubby ordered... yup you guessed it.. Endless Shrimp and priced at $14.99 only.  We also had the lobster pizza as the appetizer.

The pizza was ok.  Not enough lobster on there.  My glazed salmon was very good.  Moist.. looked very good to the eye... and tasted great.  As for the hubby, he had oodles of shrimps.  Here are a few things he tried... shrimp pasta, battered fried shrimps, shrimp scampi, parmesan shrimps, coconut shrimps, and grilled teriyaki shrimps on a skewer.  Yes, I tried some of his shrimps... I like the creamy pineapple sauce for the coconut shrimps... and I&#39;ve always loved the shrimp scampi.  Which is garlicky and buttery.

Our waitress was so very nice.  She was always checking in on us, even if the table she was helping next to us, were all having endless shrimp as well.  I felt sorry for her after a while.  The other table was ordering oodles and oodles of shrimps.  She was going back and forth, back and forth so many times for them.  In the end, she gave us a box to pack what we didn&#39;t finish to take home.

One last thing I want to talk about.  Yes... I think Red Lobster has the best bread rolls.  Always so warm, soft, tasty and they look beautiful.  I had 2 rolls, as the hubby engulfed 4 rolls.  

Go now to your nearest Red Lobster... or else suffer watching their awesome commercials that make your mouth water!"

I ordered the Lobster Bisque soup and the Shrimp Salad, sorry to say, I&#39;d not order that ever again.  The soup was really horrid (IMO) and the salad quite lacking.

HOWEVER, my dining partner ordered the 3 choice (I think that&#39;s what it is called) dinner and his was FABULOUS.  The shrimps were cooked PERFECT and the fish PERFECT.  I&#39;m VERY persnickity about how fish/seafood are cooked and this was DIVINE.

There was actually enough on his plate to feed both of us.  We should have, and WILL,  next time, order one 3 choice plate and share.  

Prices very reasonable.  The last time I was in a Red Lobster was when I was 19 years old.  I&#39;m 51 now.  I GREATLY disliked them back them.  Time changes things.  

I think this is a GREAT place for foodies like me and the location is fantabulous as well.

My GREAT compliments to our server.... he was FABULOUS!!!!

Yes, I&#39;d return, absolutely.  I just wouldn&#39;t order the &#34;lobster bisquise soup&#34;... it was TERRIBLE and I love seafood soup.

I thought the bar was too close to the front door. I would not feel comfortable sitting there with people hovering over me while they waited for a table. The booths, however, are incredibly comfortable with super cushions!

The cheddar biscuits are served warm, flakey and delicious.

Jason asked for a $22.25 full order of the Chef&#39;s Signature Maine Lobster and Shrimp Pasta. Linguini mixed with fresh asparagus and tomatoes, topped wtih white wine and lobster butter sauce. It included a Coleslaw, Garden or Caesar salad.

I was not disappointed with the 1lb $18.99 Snow Crab Legs. Steamed and served with melted butter. I added the optional 1/2 pound more for $5.50. I knew Jason would want to have some. The order also included a choice of Coleslaw, Garden or Caesar and a choice of side (steamed broccoli, mashed potatoes, wild rice pilaf, baked potato or fries seasoned with sea salt).

For a chain restaurant, the staff are helpful and enthusiastic about their work. I came here to celebrate a graduation and to my surprise, they set up balloons with my school colors and the waitress even told me congratulations! Our server was this really sweet girl with short hair (I&#39;m bad with names).

The cheddar biscuits are addictive and my salad was crisp and crunchy, so we were off to a good start! We ordered a lot of food such as the lobster pizza and it was great! I ended up ordering another pizza to go. This is one of those places where the portions are huge (at least to my family they&#39;re huge), so we just ordered different seafood dishes to share. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t really name them, but the shrimp scampi is what I got and I really enjoyed it. There was also another option which was a baked dish with a variety of seafood that was also tasty. The only thing I found disappointing was the size of the mussels - they were tiny! Then again, the lobster portions are big, so I guess it makes up for that. Another annoyance was the amount of oil that collected at the bottom of our baked dish - it was mildly alarming because you suddenly wonder about the calories in your food. The desserts aren&#39;t too special - they&#39;re good, but plain. I got the key lime pie and it wasn&#39;t anything special, but it was a hearty helping that I could share. 

All in all, I think the prices are worth it for a seafood restaurant, and I&#39;d definitely come back to celebrate."

A single star for the MOD (manager on duty) Saturday evening, November 8th. He kind of blew it for Red Lobster, and himself. He very easily COULD HAVE kept us as happy, FREQUENT customers, who only go to Red Lobster for the Alaskan King Crab legs. The restaurant didn&#39;t have Alaskan King Crab, and they hadn&#39;t had it for three days, problems with the vendor. As a customer who came in specifically for the King Crab, I dont want to hear about problems with the vendor, especially if the quality is poor, and a manager should never, ever hint of quality issues, to a customer, just don&#39;t have the Alaskan King Crab on the menu, ESPECIALLY, the daily &#34;SPECIAL&#34; menu. In case you&#39;re wondering, we never even thought to ask about the King Crab, as it WAS on the &#34;SPECIALS&#34;, and, it was very early in the evening, so we&#39;d never think to question if they had it or not. This entire situation is the FAULT of the manager, for not taking the King Crab off the &#34;SPECIALS&#34; menu, or at least making sure all his servers knew of no King Crab, in the house.
  I&#39;ll say one more thing about the manager that evening, he never even offered to comp our drinks, or desserts, heck, I&#39;ve been comped at McDonald&#39;s when they&#39;ve messed up an order.  All he did was apologize for not having King Crab, and told us, in detail how bad their last shipment was. 
 As far as the service, it was five stars. Aggie, our server, also five stars, she was great! We&#39;ve had her in past visits, and she was great then too! She was also very apologetic. Because of her good attitude, and lots of ribbing from me, she earned her 20% tip. Too bad she had to work under a lousy manager. 
As far as rating Red Lobster,  no star rating, but we will continue to go back, although, I&#39;ll never order a pound and a half of snow crab again, not even if it&#39;s on a half price special."

Went in for dinner tonight and was greeted by a friendly manager and very nice hosts. We were served by Kristina and if you are in the area, stop by and see her. I critique my servers just as much as I critique the food put in front of me. She was great! Such a pleasure. Never had to ask for a refill, either.

The manager stopped by mid-meal by us and a number of other people around us to make sure we were happy with everything. He offered to fill up my boyfriend&#39;s soda as well. I love any manager that is willing to get his hands dirty. 

Food was PERFECT!!! Biscuts were hot and fresh; scallops perfectly cooked, shrimp was yummy and chicken was hot and succulent, just like I like it!

Oh, where to start. The selection of the menu was pretty extensive- prices were the normal, and they had a lot of seafood trios and feast deals. I ordered the seafood &#34;you pick two&#34; special: the bbq scallops and shrimp.

As I waited, the salad came out.. and then, the BISCUITS. I love their cheddar biscuits! So warm and tasty.... love it.

My meal was large.. but.. overall taste of it, was strange:
The bbq scallops: was wrapped in bacon, with tons of bbq sauce on it. It was... strange?
The shrimp: was in some insane salty sauce.. I went through 3 glasses of water.
The onion rings on the plate: soggy. not cool.
The rice pilaf: Also, way too salty. I almost had another glass of water.

I had key lime pie for dessert, which was surprisingly good, but if I go to a SEAFOOD restaurant, I expect the SEAFOOD to be good. It was not. :P

If you just want appetitizers and dessert, sure, this place is alright. But for seafood? BLEH."

So, we walk in with our brood of three kids and the hostess right away offers to let the kids pet a lobster, that was awesome for them!

At the table, after only a 5 minute wait, we had a good server, although he was very soft spoken so it was a little difficult to hear him at times.  Ordered, kids had popcorn shrimp and snow crab legs; hubby had shrimp, lobster tail and scallops and I had a steak.  Honestly, I think the only thing that wasn&#39;t really good was the steak.  Hubby totally enjoyed his dinner and my little girl who&#39;d been dying to try crab legs LOVED her snow crab legs; my son was indifferent about his shrimp, but I think it was because it was a late dinner.

The service was actually very good, not only by our server but by the whole staff that seemed attentive to all their tables and they actually appeared to enjoy working there, which is always a plus.

Service was excellent. Waitress was friendly, replenished our cheddar biscuits often (and gave us some to take home), plus tossed our Caesar salads with very light dressing, as requested.

I split a special with Jackie G. For $30 we got:
1 seafood stuffed mushroom appetizer - came bathed in oil, and didn&#39;t taste like much.
2 Caesar salads (the aforementioned, and I do recommend requesting light dressing - the stuff is really thick and goopy and could overwhelm the lettuce)
1 order shrimp Alfredo for Jackie - I didn&#39;t try, but portion was huge
1 order jumbo coconut shrimp for me - also a large portion, 11 shrimp, which was 6 more than I expected. Tasted pretty good, with the sweet pina colada sauce. Broccoli was on the peppery side but better than plain steamed."

Warmth, comfort, flavor. A few of the words I associate with these dollops of deliciousness. I try not to imagine the calories contained within or the resulting garlic breath, as I indulge in consuming these cheddar biscuits. Nevertheless, I look forward to eating them whenever I go to Red Lobster. You can get them at any of the locations, why write a review about this location?

- Good service. The waitstaff is always extremely friendly and accommodating to various requests (&#34;Water with lemon, please.&#34; &#34;Can you take a picture of us?&#34;) 

- Large sitting area. Not that I go here all of the time, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve sat in the same section once. I believe the size is due to more than the fact that it matches the suburban quality of &#34;big.&#34; This characteristic is good for diners, leaving less wait time. 

- Convenient location. Speaking of suburbs, this restaurant lies near the heart of a Schaumburg. Nestled between Woodfield Mall and Roselle Rd (where one can get off the 90), at a large intersection, I find this location a good meeting place.

Bonus: emailed coupons (to use at any location). I get made fun of my membership from another friend, so please refrain. If you join the Fresh Catch Club online, you&#39;ll get birthday as well as random coupons for free menu items."

We were served by a beautiful waitress names Renee and boy was she GREAT! I couldn&#39;t have asked for better service for my little girl&#39;s birthday celebration.  She was patient in giving us time to order since we were so indecisive, didn&#39;t rush us as we were eating, and was very attentive to our &#34;needs&#34; as we were water hogs that night.  I think she needs to either be given a raise or given more tables so everyone can experience her great service.

We had lobster pizza (my girl had that and she loved it), broiled seafood platter (which was &#34;ok&#34;), admiral&#39;s feast (which was very BIG!), shrimp linguine alfredo (delish), and peach-bourbon bbq shrimp and scallops.  Everyone finished their meals and even took some home since the servings were enormous! One more item we had that I didn&#39;t mention and how could I have left this out?

The biscuits are the only highlight of the day. It is flavorful and fluffy with crispy outlayers.  

I usually do not comment on service when I review restaurants unless they are good.  This is probably the worst service I had. Waiter forgot about the first course of the soup we ordered, brought out a wrong main course for one of my friends, and was almost lifeless during the service.

My only gripe is that some of the food is prepared on the fattening side.  I like fish b/c, typically, it&#39;s better for you.  I don&#39;t think this is the case at Red Lobster.  

They have a Tilapia dish that they cook in a bag that is very good.  I also think they have one of the best Caesar salads around."

We told the server we were kind of on a time crunch, and she had us served and out in about 25 minutes.  Great staff, really neat lay out.  The food wasn&#39;t anything spectacular (I got the shrimp alfredo pasta and I think they used a stick of butter), but let&#39;s face it ... unending cheesy biscuits?  BOOM!"

Also I had to ask the waiter to bring us more biscuits and he forgot. Wait for my biscuits? Hell no! And the place was empty too, because we went at like 2 pm on a Tuesday or something like that.

I can&#39;t remember the last time I have been to a Red Lobster, it&#39;s been years. I have to say the service was excellent thanks to our server Tony. He was really great. He cracked jokes with us &amp; even helped us make our drink selections. The Sunset Passion Colada was fabulous.

We started with stuffed mushrooms &amp; for dinner I had the Admiral&#39;s Feast &amp; Jen had the Seaside Shrimp Trio. Our portions where ginormous. With dinner you get bread, salad, and the big entree with your choice of of side, I had the baked potato &amp; Jen had the fries. We will have enough leftovers for 2 more meals. 

My only complaint is that I remember the bread being a lot bigger years ago and my baked potato, though it was quite tasty, was very small. I was super excited about ordering my potato and when it came I was a little disappointed. 

Overall it was a great experience &amp; would def go again."

One of Darden&#39;s many delicious restaurants. What can i say when you crave cheddar biscuits they are only a red lobster away. I&#39;ve been craving those things for 5 years(i just never had the time to stop in due to the 2 jobs i work), and this was my opportunity to have them. 

I ate here on March 5th, 2010 and it was a Friday evening. I took a friend with me who had also been thinking about cheddar biscuits all day long. we had jumbo cocktail shrimp for an appetizer and let me tell you that the cocktail sauce at this place is the perfect blend of horseradish and the tomato base that they use. The consistency is perfectly thick enough to stick to the just-right chilled jumbo shrimp with every dip.

Our server TIM rocked! His timing was perfect with bringing out the appetizer, then our entree, and our drinks were delicious. I had a mudslide and let me tell you it is succulent and tasty going down with just the right mix of alcohol, tastes like a frosty milkshake.... mmmmm. His table talk skills and enthusiastic personality made this dinner date a good time. He kept his space at the right time and not once did he interrupt our conversation and came in just at the right time to ask us if we needed anything. 

Our entree: we had the blackened tilapia which he recommended but also what we had a taste for this friday night. We shared a full dish because what&#39;s great is they have the option to get a half dish if you&#39;re not that hungry, which is great if you want to avoid bringing leftovers. The tilapia was so delicious.

I was eating cheddar biscuits throughout the night and our basket was never empty without those buttery-cheddary-perfectly-crispy sinful things. I think i ate 2 full baskets by myself. lol

We were so full from the biscuits, appetizer and tilapia and drinks that I had no room for dessert. To top it off TIM even hooked it up with an extra bag of cheddar biscuits and that really made my night. Those biscuits lasted me a day and a half.

Overall, I was impressed with the service and timing, i loved the food, my date loved everything, and it turned out to be a really great evening. Thank you Red Lobster, I&#39;m not gonna wait 5 years to come back this time."

Located in the JCP wing, upper-level, near the Cheesecake Factory, and Claire&#39;s.  This is a great spot.  Lots of counter space and good display of the cookies.  They also have a small eating area with counter tops and a handful of chairs/stools (5-6?).   Nicely decorated to match the yellow/brown tones in the famous Nestle logo.

We were excited to see this, and had to try out a handful of the different cookies, especially since the Mrs. Field&#39;s in Woodfield closed.  Cookies, brownies, dessert bars and an array of sweet beverages including coffee drinks and icees. Had the classic Nestle chocolate chip cookies along with a turtle bar, and cookie sandwich (whipped icing w/sprinkles in the middle).  All very good, and yes, the cookies tasted just as good as if we baked them at home...using Nestle chocolate chips.  I didn&#39;t notice any white chocolate chip cookies (with or without macadamia nuts), though, and those are always a fave of ours.

We took a seat in the eating area and enjoyed our treats while people-watching.

Staff was friendly and quick, and business was good that night.  There was a line but they got through the customers quickly.

Glad to have a new dessert/snack spot in the mall!"

Ok fine, you aren&#39;t willing to try. So handed over my cardThe person who works there looks at it and says it won&#39;t work. It&#39;s a Costco card.... It will... It always does. Then when I insisted she use it, she swipes it 10 times and tells me card not getting accepted... It finally did. It would have the first time if she tried it properly, instead of swiping multiple times. Really disappointed."

I placed my order through Grubhub. The app allows the user to visually see what they are ordering, how much everything will cost (including tip&amp;delivery), and the tracking of your order. After placing the order, the final price was $17.00 (including tip and delivery). Next, the app estimated the time of delivery (7:45-7:55pm); fine, that&#39;s obviously reasonable. Then, the time starts passing by... 7:50, 8:00, 8:15, 8:30pm... Now I&#39;m getting annoyed. After noticing the time going by, I received a notification that my bill went from $17, to $24! Ok, I&#39;m cool with spending a little extra on a side of sauce, but to go from $17 to $24 dollars is a little ridiculous. Not sure if that&#39;s Grubhub&#39;s issue for not stating on their website that sauce is an extra &#34;$7 dollars&#34;, but when I placed my order, it listed everything including tip, and delivery; not sauce price--where did that extra $7 dollar charge from? 

I then called the restaurant to notify the host that it&#39;s been over 35 minutes late from when my food was suppose to be delivered. The host was extremely rude telling me: &#34;it&#39;s not my problem that he&#39;s not there yet; I can&#39;t control it.&#34; Ok, it is your problem because it&#39;s your restaurant that is suppose to be serving its customers. After calling to calmly ask about the delivery, the food finally came at 8:40pm. The food was so cold, soggy, the sauce I order (which could easily been $7 dollars because who knows where that charge came from) was poured so low it barely covered the bottom of the container. 

I&#39;m extremely disappointed in the service overall, and not pleased with #Grubhub as well. I would have appreciated more of a true price at checkout than a deceiving outcome, and more customer service, and quality of food."

Finally walk in and no one even looked up at me so I grabbed a take out menu since it says &#34;please wait to be seated.&#34; Looking at the menu maybe a good 8 mins they woman who never even introduced herself asked me did I know what I wanted. I asked to be seated. (Now I am alone but I go out to eat by myself quite often) she directed me to a table all the way on the wall. Near the rear. There is no one else in the restaurant. Whatever. But then I&#39;m looking at the drinks and get a tea and order already. I ask which one is better and she didn&#39;t seem to have an opinion. Cool I&#39;ll just get something I guess is good. She brings it out and stands for a minute then walks away. Maybe 20 minutes into my meal an older Caucasian couple comes in and what a switch. Baby girl is now all smiles giggles and  conversation.

I have not been here for dinner. It is a bit strange, run by Thai people with hispanic-looking cooks. The restaurant itself is nice, decently large and the kitchen is open so you can always see what is going on. Now to the food...

For full disclosure, I lived in Thailand for 5 years, am married to a Thai person and travel to Thailand regularly. So being fluent in Thai, I discovered that there is actually a secret to this restaurant if you want authentic Thai food. And I disclose this reluctantly because I don&#39;t want a rush of rude Americans demanding this secret. But there is a second THAI menu for Thai people to order off of. So if you can read Thai or at least speak Thai to the staff, they respond with bringing you authentic dishes. But again, I was ordering authentic Thai dishes off a Thai menu in Thai. I have never ordered off of the English main menu.

Having said that, not everything was perfect off the Thai menu, but there were some great dishes. If I still have a picture of the Thai menu, I&#39;ll post for those who are interested.

I think the owners Americanize the Thai food not realizing what well developed Thai palates Americans have these days. Unfortunately this results in bland food prepared by non-Thai cooks. But, of course, this frees up the Thai staff to cook for the occasional Thai person, or Thai-speaking person to cook authentic dishes off the secret menu!"

I found the very minimal staff unpleasant.  I figured since we were the only ones in the place at a prime time, she would try and be at least nice and thankful there is anyone in the place at all, you know, maybe we might want to come back?  Guess not, cause they were very bitter. 

The food...bland.  For a Thai place, there was very minimal vegetarian/vegan choices.  I don&#39;t think the food is &#34;Thai&#34; at all.

Thai Spoon is, not by any means, authentic but even though it&#39;s a bit &#34;americanized&#34;,  the quality of the food that I&#39;ve eaten there has been very good so far.  At least try the Panang Curry or the Beef Pad See-ew...you can&#39;t go wrong with those."

Unfortunately, I have to say I agree with them. The Tom Yum soup was ok - not the best but not as bad as some have said. It did have some spice/kick but not much cilantro or lemongrass flavor to it. I also had the Pad Thai, which was dry and bland. The noodles were all stuck together in clumps. There are definitely better places to get Thai. My husband ordered the sesame chicken, was was terribly over-fried. The chicken was almost black, which at first I thought was due to the sauce until I tried a piece and found it was just over-cooked. Too bad. I won&#39;t be going back."

It was awful. I ordered Shue Mai,  and I seen that they put it in the microwave before giving it to me! What was that about??
Not great, it was over cooked and not flavorful at all.
I also ordered Tom Yum soup with shrimp, It was like some one stirred mud and put the bottom of the lake inside the plastic container to go. What the hell happened to the beautiful orange color, and the spicy flavor???? I threw it in the garbage! I also ordered the Chicken 
Panang Curry, it was flavorless. It smelled really good and the color was pretty, but when I put it over the rice, it had no flavor and no spice!!


I was turned off my the non thai cooks, and one was handlng raw chicken, and never washed his hands after handling the bloody chicken bag. It was really gross and that was enough to make me not go back.

I was very disappointed with the taste. Not authentic enough for me.
As most Thai resturants in this area. They figure who will know the diffrence, While I am a white girl, I love authenic Thai food!

This place can keep the flavorless food, the non Thai cooks, and the e-coli that the customers will get  from the cooks not washing their hands! I do not recommed this even if it is in area! Yuk!!!! :{"

It looks promising but on the two occassions I&#39;ve been here for lunch, the food is uggghhh. I eat it because I&#39;m hungry and I&#39;ve paid for it. The first time I went, I found a hair in my food- plus it wasn&#39;t that good. A year later, food was just blah, very salty, no hint of spice even in &#39;spicy&#39; dishes, and the rice was on the dry side....  Plus, they don&#39;t have a variety of lunch specials-only one per day!!! Weird."

Was just searching on Google for a new restaurant to check out that wasn&#39;t too far away.  The name definitely caught my attention.

The food was very enjoyable.  My wife and I each had the Sante Fe Chicken, which was filled with flavor and a good portion size.  However, the various tequila drinks they have are the most unique trait of this place, outside of the monkey themed decorations.  The margarita I had was strong, but still had flavor to it, and came in a large glass.  It was well worth the price, which was pretty standard for margaritas.

The best part was the extremely friendly staff.  Our server, Rishi, was very friendly and had a personality, joking with us each time he came to make sure everything was going well.  At one point, another gentleman, who appeared to be an owner/manager, came by and made a quick appearance just to make sure everything was going well and even asked us if we wouldn&#39;t mind providing feedback later so they could keep improving.

Definitely planning on coming back!"

He had order a drink. Bartender, to no fault of her own, initially ignored me to serve her boss. The owner, if he were customer centric, would have asked her to serve their customer first.  Instead of his very complicated drink order my need would have taken precedent.  It wasn&#39;t an extended wait for and I usually would not have cared had it been another customer that was before.  But if the owner can sit around and not even care for his customers needs before his own drink... Is really where I wanna spend money.

Could have got the guac at costco and made better fish tacos on my own. Waste of twenty bucks. 

Only redeeming quality... The margarita was stong!  Still again bad ownership. Bartender made that drink right in front of the owner. Over pouring is the number one factor in bar sales!"

I will mention this place is in a strip mall, though adorable with a monkey-esque theme going on!  My friend and I came here on a Tuesday which happened to be their &#34;taco tuesday&#34; special night.  We both ordered margaritas...I was super thrilled to find a spicy margarita on the menu so of course I ordered that!  We also ordered guacamole, and tacos...with the deal our bill came to about $21.  The place wasn&#39;t dead, though wasn&#39;t packed either for dinner on a Tuesday night.  The service was average - our server didn&#39;t mention the special, we had to ask as we saw it on the website.  I don&#39;t live in the area, my friend does so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d make a special trip out this way, but it&#39;s worth a try if you&#39;re curious like I was...or, just for the name! :)"

First, we were not given water right away, or even offered water. Margarita was ok, but I just ordered a house margarita because I just wasn&#39;t feeling any of the &#34;fancy&#34; ones at the time. Chips and salsa were fine, nothing special. I ordered the coconut shrimp tacos they were interesting, but good. My husband ordered the chicken tacos and said they were boring and just ok. The place was basically empty. I&#39;m a teacher so I think it is cool they have a discount for teachers on Fridays. We will probably go back to give it another go, but wont rush back."

The Queso dip is homemade so I will suggest ordering it before you arrive to the restaurant, if you are going to eat it as appetizer it takes a while for it to get done. But it is worth it. The service and food was good even after my sisters and I were some of the last people in the restaurant we were not kicked out. Lol

Make reservations they are very busy on weekends.

On to the meal and drinks-

The bartender made us drinks that were not on the menu and it was fantastic.  I then shared with our waiter that I needed to eat gluten free and he was very accommodating with it.  Although there were not many gluten free choices, I was able to eat safely, which is what matters most.

We&#39;ve talked about going since it opened up but for one reason or another never gone.  (We&#39;re not &#39;bar people&#39; and over time the Tipsi Monkey seems to be marketing itself as more of a bar than a restaurant, so that&#39;s part of it.)  But finally this week we went...and are glad we did.  

We went about five o&#39;clock mid-week and found the place nicely designed, clean, and the music at a reasonable level.  We opted to sit in the dining area instead of the bar area, which is nice.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The $5 happy hour margarita surprised us by being HUGE.  We ordered the Tacos for Two which we also found tasty and plentiful.  (So much so that we took home leftovers.  I won&#39;t promise that you will since we each had just two tacos and the are small, but it was plenty for us.)  The rest of the menu was not expansive, but also not small and we saw other items we&#39;d like to try on future visits.  The cost is about what we expected to pay for a sit-down place with table service.

All in all, we were extremely pleased with our experience and plan to add it to our list of regular places.    :-)"

My boyfriend and I had such a great time. RAj our waiter was so helpful and his suggestions were excellent. I tried the not on the menu margarita with habanero infused simple syrup with muddled cucumber and tangerine. It was by far the best margarita I have ever had. Tangy, a little sweet with freshness from the cucumber and then a slight kick of heat as an afterthought. My boyfriend had the sangria swirl margarita that was tasty as well. 
 We had a flight of tequila shots that Raj picked for us. Great choices! 
 We chose the potato chorizo tacquitos as our app. Unbelievably tasty. Like Mexican comfort food. The fried tortillas were so fresh and crispy and the inside potato was fluffy with some melty chihuahua cheese to add to the goodness. A little more chorizo would have been perfect.
 I had the steak tacos with onion, cilantro, and lime. 4 street taco sized tacos per order. Wonderful two bite treats. Steak was cooked perfectly and those little tortillas were warm with the right amount of chew. Little bouncy fluffy tortillas. 
 My boyfriend had the steak, chicken, and shrimp fajitas which he said were the best he has ever had. I tried his shrimp and it was perfectly cooked and the freshness really stood out.

After we were seated, and as the evening progressed, I was pleasantly surprised. They had high chairs and we were seated in the slightly separate section towards the back. Also, the place was loud enough that I didn&#39;t have to worry about the kids bothering anyone. (Phewf!)

The waitress was very friendly and checked on us frequently. The food was delicious. My daughter especially loved the nachos and I loved the spicy salsa.

1st star goes to the name. the name itself sounds fun and somewhere I wanted to check out. I have heard about this place and heard both good things and bad, so I was more than happy to try it out for the name alone. 

2nd star goes to our adorable server. She was friendly and totally personable. She had her flaws I will talk about later, but she&#39;s a keeper for sure!

3rd star goes to the chips and salsa. The salsa was fresh and the chips were delicious. It was not very oniony and I&#39;m always a fan of that! Well done, TM!

Fourth star is for the food. It&#39;s excellent. The chicken tortilla soup was amazing. They really know how to cook here!!

We decided to do the taco party. You have a choice of two meats. We chose the chicken and the BBQ pork. The barbecue pork was shredded and had an excellent flavor. The chicken was very well seasoned. I was not crazy about how they served it. Everything came in little cups. Really took up a lot of table space. There was two of us eating and the table was very crowded with all these little cups. I can&#39;t imagine if we were 4 people at the table, there would not have been anywhere for anyone to put their beverage or even two more plates.

5th missing star goes to the staff. Our server was friendly and totally personable. She really was adorable but she needs to learn the menu a little better and we suggested to the owner that he have the staff try all the items on the menu so they know what their talking about. The response of &#34;I cant really tell you because I never had it&#34; doesn&#39;t work for me.

The pricing...they are severely overcharging for what they are serving. I could see paying what they charge in downtown Chicago or even a fancy neighborhood like Barrington, but it doesn&#39;t work in Bartlett and I foresee that being an issue for the owners down the road."

Setup:
3ish on a Saturday. 
6 people
Place was almost empty.

Food:
Tri-color chips and salsa- Hot and fresh! Salsa was okay, fresh but nothing special. We also got a hot Salsa that was quite good. 8 out of 10

Quest Fundito- This was a surprise!!! This was Excellent! Caramelized onions with a fantastic sauce! Well worth it! Solid 9

Traditional Steak Tacos- Best flavor for 
a traditional taco I have found. Good sized portion! 10 for what it is.

Chicken Quesadillas- Good 7

Guac- Tasty and fresh 8

Kids meals are the best I have ever gotten!!! Huge plate, with high quality food rather than the sad food kids usually get! Fresh made fries that are super thin and really good! Kids had enchiladas and they ate the plate clean! 10!

Over all I would go back regularly if I lived near by, but I will make the hour trip every now and again! I really want to try the drinks!  

The only gripe I have is that the video poker machines and bar style ads/signs out front do this place a disservice. I almost did not bring the family inside since it looked like a dive bar from the front. Someone spent a lot of time building a great brand and menu, I think they should stick to being the great/high-end place they are and not fall into the crappy bar promo stuff I&#39;m seeing plastered all over the place. The inside of this place looks great too and was well decorated for Halloween. I know the Machines are a good source of revenue but put them in back out of sight.

The TV show bar rescue comes to mind with all the statistics on why to avoid neon and bar/ beer signs. This place is waaay to good for that!

GO!"

The margaritas are delicious, don&#39;t get me wrong. But they are sooooo good that they try to distract you from the horrible food. The queso fundido had too many distractions in it, I like my queso simple. The shrimp tacos tasted like sun screen and the steak tacos were marinated it some gross sauce. The only saving grace for the food was the fries which is shocking because this is supposed to be a Mexican restaurant. So sad too bad. Ps one and a half Mexicans came here so you can trust us."

You get the first bowl of chips and salsa for free :) 
I got the fish tacos and they were very well made
This place is right across my friends new place so we thought we&#39;d give it a try for the first time and it was a pretty good experience. 
The only thing my friends and I wondered was where the live entertainment would set up as the place didn&#39;t look like they could have an entertainment area. Oh well. Guess we gotta come back and find out!"

Our first impression of the motif:  It&#39;s cute, quirky, and quaint with charming, little monkeys stenciled on the walls.  This is a taco and tequila bar.  Interestingly, they did not have Mexican music playing; rather, they were playing something more eclectic, something rhythmic, which was nice to hear something different and unexpected.

Service:  Pleasant, attentive service.  Drinks and orders were timely placed and delivered.  We did not need to ask for anything additional.  Our entrees were served exactly as requested.  Plates were cleaned from the table in an appropriate time frame after eating.

The food:  Wow!  First, we were served with multicolored corn chips and homemade salsa with just the right amount of heat to it.  We couldn&#39;t stop eating the chips and salsa, not because we were hungry, but because it tasted so good!  I think we had three refills of salsa.  

As for our entrees, two of four of us had the carnitas tacos and loved them!  They were recommended and oh, so good!!   The portion size for the tacos is good -- four small tacos with an option of adding beans and rice.  The beans were cooked perfectly.  Most of the time when I get refried beans in a restaurant, they are extraordinarily dry, like they were scraped off the inside of the pan. Yuk!  Not even close to that with the beans at the Tipsi Monkey.  These beans were served just right -- right temperature, right color (not an overcooked brown color), and the right texture (not that &#34;sticky&#34; dried out look).  These were the best beans I&#39;ve had in a very long time.

The third person in our party got the pulled pork tacos and loved those too!  The fourth member of our party ordered a burrito.  Holy smokes!! That thing was huge!  She ate the whole burrito and loved it!!  I don&#39;t even know where she put it all.

Drinks:  We didn&#39;t try any tequila this visit.  We ordered domestic bottles of beer, which were on special for the month. 

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t live in the area or I would definitely go back to the Tipsi Monkey soon.  Next time I am in or around Bartlett, however, I will make an effort to go back to this place though.  

Keep up the great service and excellent food, Tipsi Monkey!!  :-)"

Though if I were just reviewing the quality &amp; size of their margaritas I&#39;d have to go with 5 stars! ;-)

The food is good, the portions are decent but not gigantic for most things.  I&#39;m sticking with 3 stars because:
-I think the prices may seem a tiny bit higher than your standard Mexican restaurant
-The menu is definitely limited compared to other Mexican restaurants but what they do have is good (love those fish tacos!)
-The service has just been okay.  Not bad but not as friendly or attentive as I would like.
-The restaurant is tiny.  When they are busy it fills up fast and it&#39;s a bit claustrophobic and very LOUD in there.

It does have fun but very nice decor and those margaritas and fish tacos will definitely have me coming back on occasion."

We were a party of two toddlers and two sets of parents but they seated us quickly and got us two high chairs.  We were served two big bowls of chips and salsa.  The salsa had a nice flavor too it.  I ate too much chips and salsa for sure.  
This place is more of a tex-mex place.  But that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.  One thing that stood out to me which is kinda iffy is the fact that an order of rice, beans, and cheese costs $4.50.  They are listed on the same line in the menu as $1.50  I think that&#39;s kind of expensive.
I had the fish tacos, which were pretty delicious.  They came with a cole slaw, and some sweet and spicy sauce.  I gobbled them down.  I&#39;ll admit I was kinda missing the cilantro and onion.  But, it was still delicious and they used corn tortillas.  
I&#39;ll be back again I&#39;m sure."

Both times I was there they had live music and that duo did good oldies &amp; dance tunes that got folks up &amp; dancing which added to the comfort &amp; cozy, they kept the current sports teams games on the large screens - a plus!

Cons- I had heard from a couple people who liked the food &amp; didn&#39;t like the service and wouldn&#39;t come &amp; meet me there.  Unfortunately the service really left a lot to be desired and could not be considered good.  I spent well over a hundred dollars on dinner and drinks and at one point we had to go to the bar to get drinks, the table was piled with dishes from dinner, beer bottles and empty glasses that just sat there on table for over an hour without them being cleared off.   Either they need to train the staff to provide better customer service or hire someone to clear tables.  
As pleasant, personable and warm as the server was  doesn&#39;t make up for the poor level of service.

That being said I will stop in again for drinks only and see if the service has improved before I spend again the  kind of money I spent there before."

The great effort by our server to rescue the experience almost gets this up to a two star, but at the end of the day I just can&#39;t justify a rating over 1 based on our food experience.    I won&#39;t pile on with the disappointment on the food but will make one simple recommendation I would make to the chef, when I eat a a shrimp fajita I really don&#39;t want to dig through veggies and sauce to take the hard shells off of the tails of the shrimp.   I do prefer to manage that mess than eating the shells, but I would recommend removing shells before serving them mixed in with a larger dish."

**I like the streamlined menu (hey, if you do something right, there&#39;s no need to have 18 pages of fluff)
**I also liked the portion sizes
**The salsa was very flavorful but not spicy which is EXACTLY how my white butt likes it (spicy and I are not besties)
**The drink I got (the ape margarita) was REALLY strong.  LOVED it.  Very delicious.  My friend&#39;s strawberry margarita was really good as well!
**The nachos were really yummy--I like when nachos have refried beans on them!
**I ordered the chicken Parrilla, and enjoyed it immensely!


Our waitress was really sweet, attentive, and really kept us happy and well-fed!  

What I didn&#39;t like about the place was how small it was.  You know those restaurants where you see it from the outside, and it is WAY bigger once you get inside?  This is NOT one of those restaurants.  We had a hard time getting in and out of our seats because it&#39;s pretty tightly cramped.

The food is great, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the drinks are AMAZING!

We were greeted by the owner&#39;s daughter and promptly seated with a smile.  She&#39;s a spunky, young woman who had me chuckling a few times over the course of the evening.  Fresh, warm chips hit the table with a nice chunky salsa.  We took care of those pretty quickly and our waitress offered more, but we decided to save room for the main dishes.

The menu is pretty simple.  It was a pleasant surprise to see a streamlined menu.  Do one thing &amp; do it right.  Some appetizers - maybe six or eight of them, some unique entrees that come with rice and beans, many varieties of tacos, a few simple side dishes, drinks and desserts.  My son decided to try the shrimp tacos.  This was a platter of four tacos on blue corn tortillas with breaded shrimp, tasty cole slaw and a sweet and spicy sauce.  He did a good job of clearing his plate.  My husband and I decided to have a &#39;Taco Party&#39;!  We chose two meats - seasoned steak and lightly breaded tilapia (fish).  He opted for flour tortillas &amp; I chose soft corn (red corn) tortillas.  The accompaniments were plentiful!  A mound of guacamole, onions &amp; cilantro, pico de gallo, sour cream, refried beans, the sweet &amp; spicy sauce, a creamy cole slaw and honestly, there were a couple more things that I didn&#39;t use, so I can&#39;t place them right now.  We ate all of the meat and the cole slaw, but didn&#39;t even come close to using up everything else.  

Our waitress was lovely...a real sweetheart.  She kept our glasses full and promptly moved dirty dishes off of the table.  

We also met the owner.  He arrived at the end of the meal, right along with the check.  It turns out that this is definitely not his first rodeo.  With different restaurant concepts in Elgin, Arlington Heights (I think?) and Southern Illinois, he is a seasoned restaurateur.  Soft spoken and maybe even a little shy, our conversation was quick.  But I was glad to meet the man behind our newest Bartlett restaurant.  I wish him well and will look forward to another tasty meal again soon!"

At the Tipsi Monkey, the &#34;monkey&#34; theme or name was everywhere from their drink specials to the accent decorations around the bar. Even their free WiFi password had a monkey word in it (but you&#39;ll have to ask your server for that).

Although the Tipsi Monkey is billed as a Taco &amp; Tequila Bar, I usually rate any place that serves Mexican food by their enchiladas. So on my first visit to the Tipsi Monkey, I ordered their enchilada dinner and a small side of guacamole. The dinner came with the standard beans and Spanish rice.

I wasn&#39;t really impressed with the quality of the enchiladas. The server did tell me the red sauce wasn&#39;t spicy, so I was okay with that. However, the chicken and corn tortillas were quite mushy together; the texture did not meet my expectations. The side of guacamole was okay (nothing special).

I did like their regular Margarita (again with a Monkey name). I&#39;m not a big drinker and I don&#39;t like overly strong drinks. Whereas I typically feel the effects of the tequila after sipping 1/4 of a typical Margarita, this drink was very mellow and either really smooth with a good quality tequila or not much alcohol at all. I finished the whole thing without much of a buzz at all, so I wondered about their mix/alcohol ratio. There was an option to add an extra monkey themed shot of tequila to the Margarita, but I opted out this time not knowing how strong their drinks were. May have to try that next time to make a good comparison.

On my next visit, I&#39;ll probably try their tacos, pass on the enchiladas and go for the upshot in a Margarita or try their Sangria. And I&#39;ll try to save room for this unique banana dessert that was on the menu."

I gave 2 stars due to effort- waitress was very kind.  This place was dead on a Saturday night.  I enjoyed the taste of the salsa but if you ate the chips without it- ewww.  They had a nasty fried in oil taste.  My fish tacos were bland, nothing special, I&#39;ve had WAY better.  The sangria- SIGH- I really thought this place would know how to make good sangria but it had the &#34;Hawaiian punch&#34; taste to it.  Go to Cooper&#39;s Hawk if you want a real sangria.  The snow monkey margarita was like a bad White Russian.  Lastly, I tried a margarita on the rocks.  Tasted like toilet water.  I couldn&#39;t even finish it and it was Saturday and I wanted to drink!  There is nothing here that will EVER bring me back.

It wasn&#39;t packed, but service was still slow. Our waitress was an unenthusiastic girl, not engaging or friendly. My first drink was alright, not very strong, and my friend and I split the chicken enchiladas. They were so so, nothing special. Then I ordered my second drink. 
My second drink, a Snow Monkey, arrived with a thick black hair in it. It was nauseating to look at, we could not stop gagging. It took forever for us to flag someone down, just wanting it to be taken away. Finally, a male server walks by, and we stop him and inform him of the hair. He says &#34;ooooh....that&#39;s probably my hair....&#34; (Awkward silence) &#34;do you want me to make you another one?&#34;  I decline, and he offered me a shot of tequila, &#34;as there&#39;s definitely no hair in the tequila&#34;.  I decline again and ask for our bill. There was no apology, no disgusted shock...and then he proceeded to bring drinks to the older couple at the next table and talk to them-- &#34;I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re so grossed out about,&#34; loudly talking about us with other customers--very inappropriate. 
After we left, my friend called to speak to the manager and complain. There was apparently no manager on duty, but we did learn that the male server is the owner&#39;s son--I suppose that is why he feels he can treat customers with such disdain. 
The girl on the phone, Jessica, was very sweet, apologized profusely, and offered us free drinks for the next time we come in...yet that&#39;s unnecessary, we will not be back."

There aren&#39;t many bar/restaurants that have a really fun atmosphere in downtown Bartlett, but this place does. The owner and staff are really friendly and attentive. Their menu might be small, but their food is fantastic. Their drinks are delicious as well as reasonably priced. My friends and I come here about once a week. Would recommend to anyone."

You can mix and match, and they&#39;re all delicious! My personal favorite is the chorizo &amp; potato taco, but I also enjoyed the shrimp, fish, and carnitas ones!

Arrived around 6:30.  Our first clue should have been that this very small place had several open tables at 6:30 on a Saturday when there are not many options in Bartlett.  After terrible food/service at the previous concept here, we decided to give this one a try.

All started out great.  The salsa was fantastic, some of the best I&#39;ve had in a while.  Although, I question giving out some pretty spicy (in a good way) salsa and then allowing the server to not return with water or take our drink order for 5-10 minutes.  Our mouths were a bit warm.

With our hopes high, we ordered the tacos for two meal.  We got the grilled steak and the pulled pork with flour tortillas.  We were brought out a nicely displayed assortment of toppings.  We made our first tacos and dug in.  Sadly, we instantly noticed that there was zero flavor to these.  Even the sour creme had no flavor.  The meat seemed clearly processed and not fresh.  The pulled pork is very likely the precooked variety available from Cosco.  I did not sense that anything was prepared with any pride or prepared fresh.  Even the tortillas were not homemade and just a bland generic type.

Service, much like when this place was Italian was slow, without personality, and simply not good enough.  My wife ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt.  She received one with no salt.  Rather than send it back, she kept it as she was very thirsty from the hot salsa.  Her drink was not very good.  Tasted either pre-made or prepared with a store bought margarita mix and tequila.  A bar featuring tequila should at least have enough pride to mix real margaritas.

We noticed &#34;comment cards&#34; stuck in with the check.  My wife suggested this means that ownership knows something is wrong, but either does not believe it or is clueless to it.  The manager did visit our table as we ate and asked us if everything was good.  I told her that the salsa was fantastic but the food was terrible and bland.  She did not seem too shocked by this and I sense she has heard this before.  We also noticed the table next to us scarfed down their chips and salsa, but left most of their dinner untouched.

We&#39;d love nothing more than to find a great local place to eat (We do love the other Mexican restaurant located down the street from here), but until things change here, we won&#39;t be back.  I predict that a for sale sign will be on the front door by years end.

We&#39;ll tolerate questionable service for a good product.  Questionable service and a poor product means we simply will bring our business to a competitor."

Maybe we should have had the fish tacos. Had the skirt steak tacos. Dry and tasteless. Boyfriend had the chorizo tacos. Yuk O! Spicy Kennel Ration. Refried beans was like eating nothing. Just texture and NO taste. Maybe we are Mexican restaurant spoiled. We did comment to each other that people probably don&#39;t come here for the food. It would be a great place to go to for just the alcohol. Margarita was great. But, I mean, even the salsa was bad. So, what do you have with the margarita? We were really hoping this would be a good place. To survive in this area, you need two things: Good food and reasonable prices. The prices are ok, but the food is not there. This is off our list. Kinda sad.


I need to update this review. They deserve some credit. It has gotten better. It is what it is. A place to hang out. The food isn&#39;t good; it isn&#39;t bad (mostly) now. It is a place to get margaritas. Food is a secondary purpose. But, since my last review, it really is much better."

Onto the food...the portions are decently sized but with just A-OK food, I wasn&#39;t terribly impressed. It does have a very limited menu so I guess I expected what few things they do have on there would be stellar. 

I had the chicken enchilada stack. Hubby had the steak tacos. We both agreed we weren&#39;t blown over by the taste.

We will certainly try again, though...so stay tuned."

The attractive name got it on my list. We decided to head there on weeknight with the Kids. Very friendly staff(Raj and company). Everyone stopped by to make sure we had great service and food. Go for the premium Margaritas and the taco plates. It was great fun and looking forward to next time.

Stale, colored bagged store bought Chips? Salsa was OK, Chips were not. Food was actually not bad Pulled Pork in Wontons - Good and Tasty.
 Margaritas: Cheap Tequila, Watery and weak. Would I go back? A resounding not in this lifetime."

Great chips and salsa!! 
Salsa is not spicy, but very fresh and flavorful!

We had the taco party for two ... perfect portions for &#34;average&#34; eaters!
If you like bigger portions for one, this is probably a bit on the smaller side for two.

Margartias were delicious!! $6 each - pretty good in my eyes - expecially for the size!

Service was great too!

My ONLY reason for 4 stars is I would have liked to see just a little bit more on the menu - I love some basic favorites that I didn&#39;t see on the menu.

We will def. be back!!"

We enjoyed our time here. Service was friendly and the &#39;ritas were good.

It pains me to see the former beautiful Sansavaria decor modified even if the monkey theme is cute....  I miss that beautiful eiffel tower and other decor (and the bread and pecan butter)."
