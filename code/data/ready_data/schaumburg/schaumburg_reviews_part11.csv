I check Yelp and a bunch of pizzerias came up. I trust most Yelp reviews, so I went with Pizza Ready due to its high ratings and individual reviews. I was in the mood for something Indian style, as well as some pizza delivery. I was very curious to try the chicken tikka pizza! Aka &#34;Indian style pizza&#34; according to other reviews. How conveniently perfect! 

I was not let down by the other reviewers, and I was surprised beyond my expectations by their pizza and their buffalo wings. I was not expecting much, but their Indian chicken tikka pizza is delicious!!! I can&#39;t over exaggerate how yummy it is! It has tender and succulent chicken pieces marinated in tikka masala, with onions, tomatoes, and coriander leaves (cilantro - great addition btw). The cheese and the sauce on the pizza were just perfect as well, in my opinion. 

The staff who answered my calls were very nice and respectful, and the man who delivered the pizza was very respectful and modest. I really appreciated that a lot. I had a rough day, and their niceness and modesty really wanted me to give them a huge hug. Wish I tipped them more but I was low on cash. 

For those who follow halal dietary restrictions, they serve halal chicken wings and halal chicken pizza if you ask for it. You have to ask for halal, however. Definitely try their wings. I tried the buffalo wings as stated above, and they were very juicy. Thank you so much for the great service!!"

I went in there for two of them on the way home yesterday and they are now $6.99 and you have to wait 20 minutes for them to cook. I would rather just go to Little Caesars.

1. This was the first Pizza Ready I had heard of/seen before 
2. Not in the greatest of neighborhoods
3. My friend who recommended it doesn&#39;t have the best track record.

The odds were not in their favor going in, but having been there 3 times now, they have made me a fan.  Little Caesars is their biggest competition since they offer $5 carry out pizzas, but Pizza Ready makes their pies to order &amp; their turnaround time is 5 mins per pie, hard to beat.  They also offer breadsticks &amp; wings which are very affordable.  I used to think Little Caesars was the best $5 pizza around, but Pizza Ready is giving them some competition!"

You just have to know you&#39;re not getting top notch pizza here, it&#39;s more of &#34;grab a pizza on the way home&#34; kinda pizza.

Sounds too good to be true?

Fortunately... it IS true! And whoa, was that unexpected!

Sausage and pepperoni are not the only toppings you can get -- you can also order black olives, peppers, ham, onions, zucchini, cilantro, pineapples, and jalapenos. They are also willing to make your order half one topping and half of another. Of course, this is something you expect from a regular pizza joint, but at a place where the pizza is ready quick (think: Little Caesar&#39;s), the variety of toppings is really nice to have. They also offer bread sticks with dipping sauces, chicken wings, and a variety of specialty pizzas. My husband and I actually ended up getting the $12.99 deal: two one-topping pizzas, bread sticks, and a liter of soda. Despite the fact that I felt overstuffed and unhealthy at the end of our meal, the pizzas were pretty amazing. They tasted fresh, not like cardboard. The breadsticks were good, but I can do without them.

If you&#39;re a Little Caesar&#39;s fan, forget that place. Come here.
Heck, I may come here instead of ordering $10 pizzas from restaurants!"

I was a little skeptical about this place when I first arrived. It&#39;s in a not-so-great neighborhood and the prices are cheap. Typically, low-end priced pizza such as Little Caesar&#39;s and CiCi&#39;s Pizza leave a bad taste in my mouth (or toilet if I&#39;m lucky). But this was surprisingly good. Hot and ready in five minutes and it still tasted fresh after the fifteen minute drive home. The breadsticks were some of the best I&#39;ve ever tasted, and I&#39;ve been to a lot of takeout pizza places.

I recently noticed this place right by their abode and decided to give it a try...five dollar pizza! Take-out only, unsurprisingly.

As the other reviews note, it is a surprisingly good pizza for five bucks. It was certainly much better than a Little Caesar&#39;s pizza. It&#39;s pretty big, if not gigantic, and the major advantage over LC is that here they make your pie fresh after you order it. I didn&#39;t time things, but I was certainly waiting less then ten minutes for my pepperoni pizza. Unsurprisingly, other customers were walking out with orders for two to four pizzas at the same time, so at least at the present level of business they seem to be able to keep the orders moving.

My friends had eaten earlier, but liked the pizza enough to have a couple of slices each. I have the remaining four (I&#39;m a big dude). Definitely enough pizza for two to three people, unless you&#39;re really big eaters. And again, three people fed for five bucks! Beat that. If we&#39;d been a bit hungrier I might have tried the garlic or cinnamon bread sticks for a whopping $1.20 (!!). Next time I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll grab some.

I especially liked the crust, which for me had just the right amount of chew while being just crispy enough. The cheese, sauce and pepperoni were again of a higher level than I was expecting, and again, the pizza was fresh out of the oven, always a huge advantage. We definitely plan to hit this place for those nights when we don&#39;t feel like venturing out or are counting our pennies."

TNT was on our list, and a mere 3 minute drive from home, so it was a no-brainer.
We were thrilled that the tiny little diner had a booth available for us to be seated immediately. We&#39;re pretty much in a constant state of hungry, and could smell the breakfast goodness in the air.
The walls are lined with bird feeders, and windowsills adorned with eclectic statutes. It has a slightly cluttered feel. There are no physical menus, rather you decide off the large one posted  above the kitchen. I wondered if the owner was a hoarder of some sort, but refocused to the task at hand: breakfast.
It&#39;s quaint, yet the servers have heart and personality, cracking jokes, and smiling. They make you feel like regulars.
We ordered water. It was promptly delivered in styrofoam cups :)
After finally deciding what to get (this, of course, takes me an inordinate amount of time) we ordered. It felt as though the waitress barely turned around before our perfect piping hot omelettes were delivered.
The food was cooked to perfection, cheesy gooey goodness, paired with browned potatoes and a side of pancakes. It was really reasonably priced too!!

This is one of those places. Like, whoa. Like, bacon &amp; egg scented &#39;do for days kind of whoa. 

As everyone else has said, this place is about as tiny, dive-y, and diner-y as it gets... at least for the northwest suburbs. 

They serve just the basics and not much more and have room for maybe 18 patrons if everyone sucked it in real hard. 

Coffee was basic. Drinks were served in styrofoam cups, which, call me new-fashioned, but I thought it was pretty sad. This place seems like it&#39;s been around forever and for as many cups as I&#39;m sure they go through, they can probably justify getting ones that aren&#39;t disposable, or at least are slightly less anti-Earth. 

I went with a grilled cheese sandwich and a side of fries while my boo got an omelet with veggies and hashbrowns. Hashbrowns were great. Nice and greasy just how I like them (I hate when they&#39;re all hard and burnt), grilled cheese was fine, fries were just the basic from a bag frozen kind, which was all I really expected. 

Our bill was only like $15, but my grilled cheese was pretty un-substantial (I know that&#39;s not a word. just pretend, k?) and I def was still hungry when I left. I thought about ordering a second grilled cheese since it was only $4, but the food was already pretty heavy from all the grease and I knew that while I likely wouldn&#39;t leave hungry with a second sandwich, my stomach probably wouldn&#39;t feel very good about it. 

Service was fine. You can tell everyone who&#39;s worked there has been there forever as they&#39;re pretty casual and know most all the customers. 

I did think the spot was cute, and I&#39;m glad I tried it. I do think TNT has a place in the community and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s there and obviously doing well for itself.

What makes TNT a notch above similar diners in the area? The patio! If it&#39;s a nice day out, you can chill and have some delicious breakfast and lunch eats outdoors. Well that and the eats. Service is a bit above your standard diner service, too. Nothing fancy but they are friendly and polite which isn&#39;t always the norm at diners. 

On to the food, it&#39;s really good. All of it. The standout for me is their corned beef hash though. I don&#39;t want to get all crazy here but it may just be the best I&#39;ve ever had. Their biscuits and gravy are also top notch. They have a huge menu full of very well priced items so I&#39;ll be dining here for quite some time before I knock out everything I want to taste.

TIPS: Ask for a menu; There are things on the menu that aren&#39;t listed on the wall! Have a slice of pie! If you are a fan of southern style grits with your breakfast, you can get them here!

It&#39;s definitely an unassuming little place with a handful of booths, small patio and swivel seating at the bar. I rolled into TNT&#39;s looking for something quick and easy, and the menu is definitely on point for such a craving. Expect most items a la carte and you&#39;ll see offerings like sandwiches, omelets, hash browns, burgers, French toast, hotcakes, and more. It&#39;s cash only, but prices are quite affordable! I paid just $2.50 for my single cheeseburger. 

The cheeseburger itself was just fine - your basic sesame seed bun, beef, lettuce and tomato. With the friendly service and the no nonsense diner eats, I want to pop back in to TNT&#39;s and try out some of their other offerings (namely eggs and hotcakes) for an updated review!"

The staff is mostly family or long time employees.  They work hard to please you and the food is fantastic.  I typically order bacon and eggs (and they make it perfect with bacon still sizzling when served) but later discovered they have fantastic grits.  I now go their probably 2-3 times a week (driving out of my way from Palatine) which is not something typical for me.  Prices great and sit at the counter and meet fun and nice people.

But if you&#39;re like me and you want fast, hot food and a place where there aren&#39;t a lot (or any) little kids running around then this is the place for you.

My wife and I have been coming here for roughly four years now ever since we moved to the area. The food is a solid 4 stars. It&#39;s not gourmet quality, but they give you plenty, it comes out quick and it comes out hot. The best part about TNT is the service ad the fact that you always know what you&#39;re getting. By that I mean you never run the risk of getting bad food.

I generally get 2 eggs over medium (they know I like runny yolks not runny whites) bacon, hash browns crispy and rye toast buttered. If I&#39;m feeling adventurous I&#39;ll get the corned beef hash as a side instead. My wife gets the soup and french fries and is always pleased. 

TNT is a great staple to have in your rolodex of restaurants. If you wake up one Saturday and realize you don&#39;t feel like cooking, but don&#39;t feel like spending a lot or having to wait long, pop on over to TNT. MAKE SURE YOU BRING CASH!!

I suggested going here for Father&#39;s Day based on my last experience here, which was pretty good. I now regard the place as &#34;OK, but inconsistent&#34;.

We went earlier (around 5:00 pm), as that is when my parents like to eat. I often feel like I am in the episode of Seinfeld about the &#34;early-bird special&#34; but as it was Father&#39;s Day, I am not going to argue. The place was busier than the last time I was here, and unfortunately, it showed, both in the food quality and the service. 

Our server was nice, but very busy and not particularly knowledgable. I ordered the Veggie Quesadillas again.  When the plate came out I inquired about the guacamole and sour cream. I wAs told the fish did not come with those garnishes. I am an ex- waitress, and all ex-waitresses read the menu, but to be fair, I looked it up online while in the restaurant. I was correct, but ended up paying for guacamole to avoid being a &#34;problem&#34;because the server was so busy. Maybe they have changed what comes with the dish, but they really should change the menu to accurately reflect the current entrees.

The salad under my entree looked slopped on the plate,  and the bottom of the quesadilla was soggy. The veggies were also undercooked. It was still edible, just not enjoyable. It was like eating something you make for the first time out of a cookbook.

My dad had fajitas and he did not seem impressed with them. He was being polite, so all I really got from him was &#34;that it wasn&#39;t worth taking the leftovers home&#34;. My mother was pretty happy with her burrito, but again, she may have just been being polite. The frozen margarita machine was broken, so she had to get her drink on the rocks. I was surprised they had not &#34;86ed&#34; frozen drinks at the start of the shift, as it was a holiday, and more people tend to order at least one drink on holidays. 

So, overall the place is &#34;A-OK&#34;, and better when it is not busy. They seemed a little understaffed and rushed in the kitchen on a holiday though. I would not return on a busy day, since I felt a bit guilty about suggesting this place."

We were seated out on their patio - it was a beautiful day. Sitting their, we realized we had a wonderful view of cars driving by on Golf Road. We waited patiently while the server chatted away with the only other people sitting outdoors. He brought them drinks, took their order, came out to check on them but never even acknowledged us. We even tried to flag him down and to call out to him. Nothing.

After about 10 minutes or so I went back to the hostess stand. We told her no one came by our table and asked to be seated at the bar. Again, we sat for another five to ten minutes trying to get a server&#39;s attention. Finally, the bartender came to us and brought chips and salsa. He said he saw we were waiting, and apologized that no one stopped by. They had specials on margaritas, so, i got one. Then, I had another. We had table side guacamole, which I would rate simply okay. While I didn&#39;t have any, my wife had chili con queso, which she said was good. The chips and salsa they serve is bottomless, and it&#39;s really good. Be careful to pace yourself.

The bartender came by periodically throughout the night to make sure we were being taken care of. I had one more margarita, but this time he brought me a large one.

It&#39;s too bad the night started out the way it had. I also wish I could recall the name of the bartender as I&#39;d like to praise him for making our night special.

After all of those drinks, I&#39;m glad that my wife didn&#39;t even finish one. Fortunately, she drove home..."

Not to mention poorly trained servers who forgot what they were supposed to bring you because they decided to clean a table instead, when it&#39;s not even busy!  Only things I can think of still good is their fresh fruit margaritas, chips and chipotle salsa &amp; tortilla soup, but that is not consistent- at times it has been overly salty.

I have tried Mexican food from the East Coast to the West Coast, &amp; even in Mexico.  Now, to start, go to this place knowing it is &#39;Americanized Mexican&#39;.  It isn&#39;t very authentic; however, you should already know that before going to a place like this.  

I&#39;ve been to this Chevys a couple times, but it was a couple years ago that I last visited.  During this visit me and my girlfriend both got the &#39;Chevys Super Cinco&#39;, which comes with: 1 taco (soft or hard shell), 2 enchiladas (one beef one chicken), 1 hand rolled pork tamale, 1 chili relleno, as well as refried or black beans and rice.

We both agreed with the outcome of our meal.  The taco wasn&#39;t horrible, seemed like fresh ingredients, but wasn&#39;t anything to write home about either.  The enchiladas were pretty bad.  Enchiladas are one of the main Mexican dishes I get, and I&#39;ve tried them in many places.  These were some of the worst I&#39;ve had.  They were edible, and didn&#39;t necessarily taste bad; but, they simply were sub-par.  The tamale pork meat tasted good, but overall I wasn&#39;t a fan of the tamale either.  We also tried 2 of their margaritas: Cadillac Margarita &amp; Mexican Bulldog (Basically a margarita with a coronita tipped upside down in the glass).  Both the drinks were satisfactory.  We gave their Deep Fried Ice Cream a try as well.  It was pretty tasty, but, of course fried icecream with whip cream and chocolate &amp; caramel drizzle on the top always would be.

I gave this Chevys 2 stars because as it shows 2 stars means, &#34;Meh. I&#39;ve experienced better&#34;.  Our bill for 2 drinks, 2 meals, and a desert was $62 before tip.  Fairly expensive for a place like this.  Most margaritas were $10 or more, although they do have a &#39;house margarita&#39; for $7.  Service was good!  Thursday night around 6:30pm.  There were a few tables and some people at the bar.  I&#39;d say restaurant was about 1/4th full.  Our waitress, Jennifer, was awesome.  She was very fast at refilling water glasses without being asked, and made sure we were doing ok and if we wanted anything else.  We were never waiting around for a waiter/waitress to attend to our dining needs.  

Overall, it&#39;s been a while since I have been to any Chevys, and I probably won&#39;t be back anytime soon."

I had to ask for chips and salsa after I had ordered my meal. I get it everyone is a Blackhawks fan except me. With TWO TV&#39;s showing the game right at the bar I asked could one be turned to the NBA playoffs that were on. Bartender did change the channel, but then the manger told him to turn it back?!? Mind you I&#39;m the only one sitting at the bar and not just  the bar but also the whole bar area with tables behind me completely empty. (I get that some of the TV&#39;s are connected to the same receiver but usually TV&#39;s are established for Bar guest and not dinning) 10min later someone else set down at the bar and asked to see the game...HA! and then the manger finally allowed it but it was on the TV the furthest from us. I had already started eating so didn&#39;t feel like moving to get the better view. 

Food was good. Ordered fajitas with steak &amp; shrimp along with the ribs (Ribs were okay, Would order it without next time) Drink was wonderful (especially for a house margarita. 10 points for it being $5 because of memorial day)

Bill took way too long to come out after I asked for it ...and took too long to pick it back up. Literally was standing next to my seat hoping the gesture would point out I was ready to go. I usually sit at the bar to avoid slow/crappy service but would probably try seating in the dining room area."

I say this because I didn&#39;t look at the yelp reviews before I came and now that I&#39;m right interview I&#39;m also giving them a three star which is their average.

Service wise I thought it was OK. Nothing exceptional nothing great just your standard may take your order for your water a couple times and heres the check.  basically nothing screen leave me a better than 20% tip nothing said don&#39;t leave me no tip. We chose this book because my girlfriend said it should be here before she thought it was pretty good and it has fast service. And it was fast but there was also nobody here either.

The food was a little disappointing though. I was really hungry when I came in and I got the prickly pear margarita. It to is OK maybe on the sweet side and not strong enough. A $6.99 drink though should be that and for that it was that. The guacamole was not that great. It was kind a runny very limey and just didn&#39;t look very presentable. We didn&#39;t eat half of it. For another appetizer we got the sampler. Wings, burritos , and a few other things. Again we left half the food on the platter. I&#39;m writing this after being gone 90 minutes and I&#39;m hungry. Not because they didn&#39;t serve enough food. The portions were good. Just didn&#39;t taste that great to me. Or her actually. 

The food itself warrants a 2 star rating but the service and speed of service bumped this to a 3 star. 

I always thought this was called Chevy Chase. Kinda wish I still thought that."

We both ordered the shrimp bowl for lunch.  By the time the food came out, my friend had to eat fast so she could get back to work.  The bowl was pretty darn tasty.  All of the ingredients were fresh, and the seasoning spot on.

My wife ordered flautas with no guacamole, sour cream or beans.  It came w/beans.  This is not the fault of the waitress, I watched her write down no beans.  The kitchen obviously cannot read.  The chicken in the flauta looked like baby food.  I had the beef chimichanga but could not even find the beef in it.  Neither my wife nor I finished our food and we did not take the leftovers home because they were not that good.  As others have said the salsa and chips are good but they are not that great either.

I had a special 15% off dinner coupon to use, we both got fajita dinners. Joshua our sever very nice man, very attentive.

I love their paper thin crispy warm tortilla chips with their fresh tomatoes roasted salsa!  We also had the Con cesco that was ok. 

I ordered the steak it was good, hubby got the carnitas it was soft but a bit too salty. Oh did I mentioned unlimited warm chips!  I didn&#39;t care much for the black beans too much cumin. The rice was dry like it came out of the box. liked the little scoop of sweet corn tomatillo. The flour tortilla was ok. I wish they had a choice of soft corn tortilla.

I was seated promptly by the hostess, and greeted by my wonderful server Nicole.  
Bartender &#34;Benny&#34; (not his real name, not sure how to spell his real name but just said to call him by his nickname) makes EXCELLENT drinks, I usually do NOT like margaritas, but he made a skinny marg. with no sour mix, or something to make it absolutely FAB!

The chips and salsa were tasty, with the chips being warm and fresh!

I ordered the Fresh Fish tacos (2) and they were Salmon that day, yuuum!  
I was easily able to substitute beans for some freshly grilled veggies mainly consisting of some delish zuccini!  Nicole was super friendly and helpful!

I normally don&#39;t love Mexican food or gravitate towards heading there for a meal out, but this was a big surprise of amazingness, I honestly was taken by surprise!  I usually don&#39;t like going to chain restaurants, for fear of crap food just slapped from a freezer into a microwave... 
no thanks, if I wanted that I could get that at home... but I was quite surprised by the freshness and yumminess that Chevy&#39;s had to offer!

The atmosphere was festive, and actually a bit too intensely bright with the eye blinding spot lights that were blaring me in the face, but that&#39;s a small thing I noticed, and everything else was pleasantly awesome!

I actually do think I will be back!

They need to work on their combinations because I don&#39;t see how some type of sweet and sour sauce goes with Mexican food. Beans tasted like out of a can, and rice was horrible, the flautas I ordered had a weird box Mac type sauce drizzled on top (horrible also) If you want spicy, that will come in a bottle of hot sauce your server will bring you.

Let me make it clear the one star is for the amazing peach margarita I had. But let&#39;s be real how hard is it to mess up a margarita as a bartender. 
The food was awful. I had the appetizer sampler and the only good thing on the plate were the wings. The quesadilla was HORRIBLE!!! The meat was shredded chicken and it had no flavor at all!! I don&#39;t even think there was cheese on the quesadilla and if there was I don&#39;t remember tasting it. The nachos were some of the worst tasting nachos I&#39;ve ever had and the flautas were less than desirable. I had a bite of one and that was all I needed. 
I recently was at a very small airport getting a connecting flight and they didn&#39;t have any restaurants that served fresh food past security. They had a quesadilla in the fridge that was pre made on Friday (it was Sunday), he put it in the microwave and that was a thousand times better than the quesadilla I had at Chevy&#39;s. 
If I&#39;m ever in Schaumburg or if I ever see a Chevy&#39;s I most certainly will not be stopping in. Not even for the margaritas. 
There has to be another Mexican restaurant in the area trust me when I say try that one!!!!!
And just so you know my colleague had steak tacos, the meat was flavorless and dry and the tacos weren&#39;t good. She even said the rice wasn&#39;t even good!! Shame because I LOVE a good Mexican restaurant and it left me still craving a good quesadilla :-("

I&#39;ve eaten here and ordered their carry-out many times; both are always great experiences and the food is simply delicious. As others mentioned, the guacamole is made table-side and the servers are really nice... just seems like they have a lot of fun doing their thing here. Overall, Chevy&#39;s reminds me of Chi-Chi&#39;s, Pepe&#39;s and Taco Bell (in a good way) -- all rolled into one great place.

Note that their drinks are well-crafted not on the weak side as you may expect. For example, the Pina Colada is cold and creamy (versus filled with shards of ice) and the Margaritas can be made your way (on the rocks or slushie-style), but have a generous amount of liquor in them.

Naturally, their home-made chips are oh so good."

Sadly I didn&#39;t have super high expectations, but that changed when we walked in - the place was pretty packed for 5pm!  (Walking out the door at 6:40, there was an ever-forming crowd waiting to be seated.)  The chips and salsa were phenom - probably one of the best salsas I&#39;ve had (dark, smoky, not too watery like most salsas are).  

He had the San Antonio Chicken Quesadilla and I had the Farmer&#39;s Market Enchiladas.  He thought there was too much BBQ sauce on the quesadillas; I had a bite and thought they were pretty good.  I LOVED my enchiladas!  I think the mushrooms were canned, though - no me gusta.  The rice on the side was your typical ho-hum rice, but there was also a pile o&#39; cornbread-tasting &#34;stuff&#34; I&#39;ve never had before that was pretty awesome.  Needless to say we both cleaned our plates.

Service was phenom even though I busted out a 2-for-1 dinner entree coupon (which, in my experience, sometimes puts a damper on waitstaff attentiveness).  We had refills of our chips and salsa, too.  I about rolled out of there food coma-style.  

If it weren&#39;t for the coupon I had, I probably never would have chosen Chevy&#39;s...now, I must say I&#39;d definitely return."

Amazing Americanized mexican fajitas! I don&#39;t known why there are so many negative reviews, but hear me out why Chevy deserves a 4 star. To begin with the staff is super friendly and helpful always ready to fill your water and refill you salsa and chips. The restaurant is quite roomy and usually you don&#39;t have to wait too long to be seated. Now on to the food. I can&#39;t say anything about the enchilada or tacos because I always get the PLATO GRANDE which comes with steak, shrimp, chicken, and carnitas. I can honestly say that the steak and shrimp are spectacular. The beef is not overcooked and super tender. Shrimp is marinated perfectly for flavor. The chicken and carnitas were a bit overdone but saved by a dab of sour cream or guac that comes as the side. You also get a helping of black or refried beans and mexican rice. The sweet corn tomatillo is perfect way to cleanse your palate. The fresh corn tortilla made on the machine are just plain heavenly. Freshly made it compliments all of the ingredients as your make your own fajita. I usually need two bags to finish my meal.  Also the free chips and &#34;roasted&#34; salsa is delicious. Chips are super crispy and thin. Also the salsa has a smoked flavor to it with finely minced tomato which IMHO is the best salsa ever. You will leave feeling super full!

Pro- relatively inexpensive, not sure why people are complaining that it is expensive. Margaritas! Happy hour 3 dollar drinks and apps on the weekday. Super friendly staff

Service was okay. Atmosphere was okay. Food was okay. Absolutely nothing really stood out to me as special, unique, authentic. I met 5 other ladies here that day and our party was a little smaller than originally anticipated. When the server approached our table, one of our ladies was in the middle of going over the itinerary for our meeting that afternoon and instead of waiting for a break in the conversation, or waiting for her to finish he rudely spoke over her until she stopped talking completely as we were greeted and asked about beverages.. While his service was prompt I didn&#39;t find it to be anything special. I ordered the cheese quesadila. You know when someone cooks a frozen pizza and the cheese needs to melt longer because you can see the individual shreds of it? That&#39;s how my cheese was. The guac was good! Came for another meeting twice now since this visit, had fajitas which were again, okay, and tried a salad and some appetizers. I enjoyed the appetizers (we got the larger sampler) and the salad was okay. I&#39;m sure we will have another meeting here, and they&#39;ll get another chance to wow me.

Like to be called &#34;amigo&#34; every 30 seconds? This is your place. We were attempting to eat at Mad Mark&#39;s, but we failed to look at Yelp beforehand -- it&#39;s closed. D&#39;oh.

In all fairness, the food is pretty good for chain Mexican. I&#39;d probably give the food 3.5 stars. The salsa is fresh and smoky, the chips are very thin and crispy. The menu is the typical variety of meat + cheese + tortilla, but they do have a few (not many) more authentic/original/interesting choices.

I had fish tacos, which were actually made with salmon, and that sort of impressed me. Usually it&#39;s tilapia or the otherwise least expensive fish they can find.The fish was grilled well with a very lovely crispy skin and fresh pico + just enough crumbled cotija. The rice was pretty good and my black beans were tender and well-seasoned. My husband didn&#39;t seem overly impressed with anything besides the rice, but he ate it all.

Service was average to mediocre. We got called amigo a lot which annoyed me, and he wasn&#39;t super attentive or friendly.

First, the good things: Chevys delivered on a fun environment including multiple televisions for enjoyment of Bulls games. Our waiter was very attentive, even being our little tour guide for where to find a good salsa dancing spot. The restroom was clean. The hostesses were nice and whomever brought out my virgin colada was decent. The food was great too...until I got a mixture of veggies and chicken in my VEGETARIAN chimichanga.

This wasn&#39;t a oh-we-thought-you-wanted-veggies-in-your-chicken-chimichanga kind of situation. This was even worse. Just surprising bits of chicken mixed in with my veggies. Now, I&#39;m not unfamiliar with the fact that things are sometimes cooked on the same grill and therefore intermingle. However, if you&#39;re going to offer a vegetarian option, it should actually be vegetarian. Not partially vegetarian. It&#39;s not like restaurants can get away with keeping your food mostly free of toxins, but also include a little salmonella. Legit is legit.

I didn&#39;t complain about it there because it was just one little piece and I caught it immediately. I ended up taking that massive leftover home and eating it the next day which is when I found another couple of pieces of chicken. Come on, Chevys. Come on.

I&#39;m truly a fan of generic, by the way. Who doesn&#39;t love the convenience of a well-manicured suburb with a plethora of stores and non-threatening restaurants?

Chevy&#39;s you will always be comforting to me because of your strong margaritas, delicious chips and salsa and variety plate dinners (because I&#39;m a Libra and making decisions is equal to water boarding to me). I like to sit at a table in the bar area and watch football or baseball and try for a brain freeze from too many original margaritas. 

And the little scoops of sweet corn dotting my plate.. OMG soooo good. Screw beans and rice, bring on the corn!

I think it had been at least a decade since eating here, prob longer, and remember it being meh back then, but for some reason, I felt like Mexican and this place was right in the area and thought I&#39;d give it another shot.

Oh boy. Not good.  

I did the mix and match lunch diddy which included one ground beef taco and a chicken enchilada w rice and beans.  The enchilada was drenched in an overly sweet red sauce and the shredded chicken was sub par quality.  Ground beef taco had some sweet concoction thrown in the mix that wasn&#39;t the best either, and to top it off the hard shell taco was stale.  The black beans were indelible. 

The bill was nearly 15$ before tip, that&#39;s outrageous.  What&#39;s more outrageous is that a pop will set u back 3$.  Give me a break, and...

We asked the waitress as we sat down about the happy hour specials and she says no happy hour drink specials but $3.99 appetizers so we weren&#39;t going to make a big fuss at least the food would be cheap. Some of the other gals raised a little fuss about it because the website never said that it would vary by location. 
As our waitress was the worst ever and even had to go to the bar to order drinks because she forgot to place them. When we get our bill none of the apps were $3.99 all higher we got him to comp our bill but still so frustrated why do you advertise $3.99 but your not going to ring up as $3.99"

The food was good, but nothing to write home about.  They serve you chips and salsa.  I just thought they were ok. The chicken enchiladas were pretty basic.  

What gets them the points, was there good service. When I go to chain restaurants, I don&#39;t expect good service, but the medicore-I-do-this-as-a-high-school-waiter type of service.  So when our waitress was helpful in making suggestions on the menu, was friendly and personable, was attentive but not pushy, always kept our drinks full, and promptly gave us the check but let us stay for half an hour without giving us the evil eye, I was pretty impressed.

We came for dinner on a Wednesday night and each of us got the dinner Deal Meal ($11.99 for a salad, entree and dessert). Their unlimited chips and salsa (free) were pretty good. I had the garden salad with the something-chipotle dressing, the chicken taco dinner, and the flan for dessert. I thought the salad was pretty good, the tacos were OK and the flan was OK too. 

Sodas are expensive. A sprite rang up at about $2.89. They feature $3 Margaritas which is a good deal, but was not in the mood for a drink.

Freed chips and salsa is nice though the size of the basket oif chips has been downsized BOOO! Salsa is good though a hint of sweet and a touch of heat. For years I got the combo platter, a taco, enchilada and whatever else came with it. Then I became lactose intolerant (not by choice), and the enchilada had to go, so I switched to fajiatas and they are the best. Chicken is tops, great flavor, nice big pieces, corn paste is killer. Rice has always been just meh and beans, well you know what beans do to most of us. 

But this time the tortillas were overdone, not bad but it over cooking them changed the texture so now it was like roti (not killer roti from Flat Top Grille), but just something other than a traditional tortilla, made the meal strange, still good but not has good as usual.

If you have to order something get the wings or the fajitas. Drinks are pricy. The only thing that really makes up for it was the kind staff.

 I shared the chicken fajitas with a friend and ordered the table side guacamole. Mmm guacamole. Luckily they were able to take out the onions and peppers for me.

Tried their vegetarian dishes as it was our first time. Ordered the paneer tikka masala, dal makhani. The paneer was fresh and yum! The masalas were perfect! 
Dal makhni was not that great but didn&#39;t let us disappointed either.

The samosas were probably the best I&#39;ve had so far. Himalayan always had good food but their samosas just weren&#39;t very good.

You&#39;ll want your order to go - trust me and every other reviewer before me. And ask for the kitchen to use less oil/ghee, since they tend to be a bit heavy-handed.

The aloo gobi, palak paneer, dal makhni, lamb kebab curry and fish curry are all delicious, and main dishes come with naan for sopping up every last savory bit of sauce.

The garlic naan, however, is WAY too garlicky even for my Korean palate - I don&#39;t enjoy biting into whole cloves, but you can give it a go if you feel brave enough."

I always love finding great little holes-in-the-wall and Ashoka did not disappoint. The Rogan Josh and the chhole were particularly good, as were the samosas. The garlic naan deserves special mention: they were made with sliced bits of real garlic, not tinned minced garlic or worse, garlic powder. Truly amazing. 

Even better - we were in town for a conference and we descended on them with 12 people in tow. They handled the crush with considerable aplomb, quietly calling in reinforcements. We hit them with 10 entrees, assorted breads, and rice - and they didn&#39;t blink. 

Several in the group were Indian food noobs and I&#39;m really glad that this was their first experience. I couldn&#39;t have asked for more.

So I did a carryout order of veggie samosas, naan, Shrimp Masala, and basmati rice.   I get there 30 minutes later and the host has my order and when I pay for it, he asks me if I wanted sauce or not to go with my Masala.    I told him if that&#39;s what comes with it, then yes.   But apparently it&#39;s optional and they didn&#39;t give me the sauce so he says it&#39;ll be a few more minutes.   

I tell him it&#39;s okay I don&#39;t need it but he proceeds to pull out the contents of my order to show me what my Masala looks like.   In the process of doing this, I noticed that the veggie samosas were basically just tossed in the bag w/o any packaging or foil.   He touches my samosas with his hands and puts it on the table.   I&#39;m besides myself because 1) I don&#39;t know where his hands have been...and obviously he&#39;s handling money and who knows what else...and 2) the table itself was not clean.

I immediately tell him I don&#39;t want the samosas and to take it off my bill.   Granted I&#39;m not naive to think they don&#39;t touch the food while preparing it but to not only pull it out in front of me but also put it on the table, I was appalled.    Not to mention there was no wrapping at all.   They just put it in the bag with the rice and Masala (sans the special sauce).   At least the naan was wrapped in foil.   We go back and forth a bit on taking out the samosas from my bill and order but eventually he does so.

Honestly I should&#39;ve not paid for any of the meal and just walked out but I wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.    He later mentioned that he tried to call back after I placed order to ask about the sauce but I didn&#39;t answer.   I didn&#39;t realize he called back but upon seeing my call history, I do acknowledge that he did.

As for the meal I will say the Marsala was okay but nothing really special.   The naan was burnt but was warm at least.

I will not return.   I would&#39;ve gone to Himalayan Restaurant but they weren&#39;t answering their phone when I called and I was craving Indian and thought I&#39;d give Ashoka a 2nd chance...especially after reading all the recent reviews.    For me though I won&#39;t be back a 3rd time."

Ashoka is delightful, but in that way where you feel like putting a review on the Interweb might spoil the secret. 

My wife and I live right around the corner and had no idea this place existed. Our first Indian love was the dear departed Himalaya that used to be nearby, but since it closed down, we&#39;ve been searching for a place to call our own. 

Ashoka is the one we&#39;ve hoped for. If you&#39;re too bougie to deal with a little bit of stickiness on the menus and not a lot of decorations or &#34;ambiance,&#34; good. Keep your sanitized little attitude out of here! 

If, on the other hand, you like killer food and an owner who is also the Chef, Waiter, Busboy, and Maître d; who adds all the personality and verve that a Sitar and a beaded curtain never could, then this is the right place.

Just do take out. I had read some of the other reviews and thought that maybe my fellow Yelpers were being too harsh on the interior of the restaurant, but they were not. The place is kind of dingy and our waiter was sitting in the middle of the restaurant eating with people and having a conversation about S&amp;M. Yes, he was attentive to us but I think it is kind of inappropriate to be eating dinner in the middle of the restaurant while you are serving food. However, that is not the main concern. As we were drinking our water, I noticed a bunch of black things at the bottom of my glass. I then looked at my boyfriend&#39;s and he had the same black debris at the bottom of his glass. I asked the server for new glasses because there was black debris floating. So, he brought us new glasses, but I noticed there was no ice. While we were eating dinner, I asked for more water and he brought us an Aquafina bottle (gross) for water because he said the ice had black stuff in it so we should just drink from the bottle. I was pretty grossed out about it. However, the food was great! Besides, a little too much garlic on the garlic naan, my eggplant and potatoes was one of the best Indian dishes I have ever had. So, please, do try this place out, it is definitely worth it but maybe dining in and drinking the water is not your best bet."

The first thing to note is that they allow you to BYOB with no corkage fee, which is definitely a plus. The restaurant is plainly decorated but I wouldn&#39;t say it is &#34;dirty&#34; as others have complained. They more than make up for it with the quality of their food though! We have been back countless times and have gotten to know the owner who is very nice. 

Every dish we have had has been awesome. We try new things every once in a while, but tend to come back to some of the same dishes because we like them so much. (I personally like the Chicken Tikka Masala.) After several dine-in and carry-out experiences we have noticed that you get a bit more food if you carry-out so keep that in mind. All of the dishes come with a side on Naan but we like to order rice which is extra.

All in all this is the best Indian food I have had. They are open from noon til 9pm most days, but it&#39;s carryout only from noon til 3pm.

I wish the orders came with rice but you have to order some seperate, no big deal.  We&#39;ve gone to other places in the area for indian/pakistani but nothing quite compares.

My husband and I love Indian food, and Ashoka is literally less than a mile from our house.  After reading the amazing reviews about the food, we couldn&#39;t resist ordering some take out.

I walked in expecting to be horrified but instead was pleasantly surprised to find that either they cleaned the place up a bit or my aesthetic standards are much lower than previous reviewers.  It looked to me like they may have replaced the carpeting and window treatments, threw up some art, added some soft background music, and perhaps took heed of recommendations to vacuum and wipe things down more often.  Maybe some previous reviewers can go back and let me know what you think.  I didn&#39;t check out the bathrooms since I entered through the &#34;Take Out&#34; door, which leads to an area that is separated from the rest of the restaurant by a partial wall.  The place is by no means gorgeous...still plain as described but as tidy as any dive one would eat in to get great food.  We may dine in next time.

The food was delectable.  We ordered the combo platter for two, which was more than enough food for two people.  The meats were cooked to perfection.  Tender lamb chunks, steaky shrimp, and juicy chicken pieces, each in their own yummy sauce.  The naan and rice were warm and fresh.  They throw in dessert too.

Thumbs up on what I expect is the best Indian place in town."

we all ordered curries. all 5 of us ordered something different. LOVED the heat. it was just perfect.

The place is...dismal. absolutely uninviting and scary, even.  We ended up here after trying Himilayan and Taj Mahal on a Tuesday night to find out there were closed.

Perhaps I&#39;ll just do take out next time.

I liked the variety on the menu, and the spicing was very palatable. I&#39;ve tried maybe a dozen Indian restaurants in the suburbs, and this shot to the top of the list. I hope to return many times."

I will say if you are looking for somewhere to eat based on ambiance it&#39;s definitely lacking in regards to that but the amazing food makes up for it.

I too have been visiting this restaurant with my best friend and his family for well over a decade and can&#39;t say enough about the fantastic flavor that Ashoka&#39;s food has. 

I strongly recommend the Chicken Saag - I order almost every time and love to dip the naan in the robust Saag sauce. The Bhel Puri is fantastic and I also recommend the Onion Pakora or any Samosa. Shrimp Biryani is a favorite as well."

I ordered to go from there with my best friend and everything was delicious! I grew  up eating/cooking Indian food so I was pretty thrilled that this place got such great reviews and existed so close to my home! 

What really made me fall in love were the cheese somosas! I could eat those all day (and would also have a hard time getting into my jeans)! When you think Cheese Somosas you think that it is going to be something just plain, like a cheese stick, but these have all sorts of things mixed in, red peppers, onions just filled with AWESOME!

I am vegetarian so I will say I always order then Paneer Makhani and it is wonderful! I always prefer my dishes with basmati rice so as a heads up you only get your dishes with naan. So if you want the rice it is an extra charge to get it (unless you get a combination meal, then it comes with it). But overall everything that I have tried has been awesome!

I would say eating there is sort of not the best, I took my mother there for her birthday and we had sticky menus, our water glasses were not all that clean and the music from the cheer place next door really was loud making us rock to the 90&#39;s dance mixes while eating our appetizers. 

The staff is friendly and the food is wonderful. I wish they made the dine in better but the to go is divine!"

We order carry out on a weekly basis since it&#39;s so good, and they are pretty fast as well.  They have great vegetable samosas and excellent naan.  Our favorite though is to order paneer tikka and plain naan (uncut) so we can make naan-wiches out of them.  The chicken tikka masala and paneer tikka masala is also delicious.  We will be moving out of the area soon, and this place will be sorely missed...we&#39;ll probably still end up making the long drive occasionally to get our Ashoka fix!

I always remember my parents taking me here to pick up small dishes or especially their samosas, which are huge and well-cooked.

The decor inside is quite drab, old and decayed. There are holes in the vinyl booths and the place is just generally grubby.

Make sure to ask about ingredients, as this is a North Indian restaurant, and many dishes will contain some kind of dairy product (milk/cream/yogurt/ghee/butter).

Also confirm that the samosas (their best dish) are vegan. Often times the samosa pastry shell is made with yogurt, so it&#39;s definitely worth checking every time."

We&#39;ve also had the veg samosa, lamb vindaloo, paneer tikka masala (this was a little too sweet), paneer chili masala, aloo mutter. The naan is a little bit pancakey (?) but you get a lot of it.

He kind of made fun of my white boyfriend for wanting food &#34;Indian&#34; spicy - but it was all in good fun :)  Decently priced and very good food.  They could spruce the place up a bit - but it&#39;s really not that bad.

When I took my mom, the first thing that caught my eye was that it looked like someone had dumped half a bag of cheetos on the floor and stomped all over it. When I pulled the chair back for her, my hand stuck to the back of the chair. The paper on the table was covered in food from previous diners. It&#39;s safe to say that the family that runs this place doesn&#39;t really care for eat-in diners that much. BUT they care about your palate. They are in the business of mean Indian cooking and they are the BEST in the 15-20mi radius BY FAR. If you need a clean pleasant dine-in experience you could go to India Palace in Wheaton and, honestly, the food at that place sucks and it&#39;s overpriced because the atmosphere is more up to code. But the staff there is pretty typical and unlikable. Not the case at good old dirty, oddball, friendly Ashoka. If you care about the elegance of spices and the flavor then they&#39;re on the same page as you. Every dish I&#39;ve had is amazing and I&#39;ve gone quite a few times now. I personally wouldn&#39;t order meat here (a friend complained, but she&#39;s a complainer so who knows). So, call &#39;em up and pick it up. Consume it off your own plates in the ambience of your home."

We ordered the Ashoka combination platter for two.  I thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp, lamb and vegetable curry, not to mention the samosas.  However, the restaurant is in need of a very deep cleaning.  I had a problem with the sticky, food coated menus, but an even bigger problem with the disgustingly filthy bathroom.  The bathroom was in far worse shape than many gas stations bathrooms I&#39;ve encountered over the years.  For that reason alone I will not return to Ashoka for the delicious food."

This was my first time at Ashoka and it was absolutely delicious. I had the veg samosa and chicken tikka masala. Everything is made from scratch and it shows!  Himalayan Restaurant and Taj Mahal have nothing on this place!  The appearance of the restaurant is off putting to say the least but the owner/chef came and talked with me and you can just see the passion he has in his food!

BUT, I mean that in absolutely the best way possible!  Though I don&#39;t mean to use two trite idioms in a single review, Ashoka really is a diamond in the rough!

It&#39;s true that the decor is...lacking  It&#39;s dark, kind of dingy and some of the seats are probably in need of repair.  And the bathroom...well...if you can do your business at home first, it is advised.  But I promise you that the quality of the food more than makes up for it! 

Every dish I&#39;ve tried has been rich and flavorful.  It&#39;s Indian food, so of course it tends to be intensely flavored, but what I mean to say is that with every bite, you can taste all of the time and effort and years of perfecting recipes that have gone into these dishes.  Everything I&#39;ve ever had from them has been delicious, and everyone I&#39;ve ever taken to this place has been in full agreement.   

In the end, naan may just be some flat bread, but Ashoka&#39;s naan is oh so soft, chewy and buttery.  As simple as it is,  you can eat an entire plateful of naan only and be perfectly satisfied.  The chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken are great &#34;introductory&#34; dishes for those who have yet to foray into Indian food.  They&#39;re creamy and perfectly spiced.  It&#39;s so good that you could give me a bowl of the sauce alone and I&#39;d be happy as a clam.

Their Saag Paneer/Palak Paneer is another dish that is sure to please.  A lot of the Saag Paneer dishes I&#39;ve tried from other restaurants have been extremely mild or, dare I say it, bland.  While this is not a spicy-hot dish, the spice combination (including a touch of mustard seed) leaves you craving the next bite.  This vegetarian dish is one of my absolute favorites (and I am no vegetarian)!       

I recently took a small group of friends to Ashoka, and each of them had nothing but compliments.  One friend ordered cheese samosas--Golden brown on the inside and piping hot and bursting with gooey cheese on the inside, those cheese samosas left me wondering why I had never thought to order them before for myself.  Another friend went so far as to say that Ashoka had the best Rogan Josh he had ever tried in his life.  From appetizers to side dishes and main dishes, my friends even salivated over the chai tea and the mango lassi.

I understand why appearances can discourage people from wanting to try this place.  But keep an open mind about this place and definitely check them out!  Or if you can&#39;t bring yourself to dine-in, at least order carry-out.  It&#39;ll be well worth it."

Went here on a recommendation of a friend; it must have been a joke.  I don&#39;t know how this place hasn&#39;t been shut downby the health inspector.  Walked in, and in between the air-lock doors was a pile of catering serving dishes, that looked and smelled like they had been there for days.  At the table, even if you put paper over the table cloth, if the table cloth has visible food stains or even pieces of food on it, the table cloth shoud be changed, not just covered over.  Food on the wall, window blinds, floor- unbelieveable.  
No one in the place when we arrived or left.  Apparently, not terribly popular of a place.
We stuck it out and ordered some food.  We are usually willing to try new things on the indian food menu, but do like to order at least one favorite (Chicken Tikka, Tikka Masala, etc), so we can compare to what we like at other restaurants.  So we orderd a few different items.  I&#39;m not sure how they do it, but everything at this place tastes the same, even though its not supposed to.
Save yourself the pain.  Much better indian food in the area.  Our fav is Taj Mahal in Roselle."

The entry door feel like it has not been cleaned since the day this place opened up, same goes for the toilet and tables. When you touch the tables you get the sticky and gue feeling. Great place for bacteria to feed on. 
The staff is obnoxious and makes you feel that you are not welcomed at this place. I asked for a spoon and he pointed to it on the table without utter a word. I thought he was vocally challanged but i found out that wasn&#39;t the case when he loudly told me my bill amount.

IF the ambience is this bad, just think about what could be behind the kitchen door where the food is actually prepared

I moved to CA 13 years ago, but I always come back when I visit.  They have numerous dishes that I rarely see at other Indian restaurants such as Bhel Puri, Ragda Patish, Masala Dosa.  

Their Indian cuisine is better than any place I&#39;ve been in SF.  

On top of being amazingly good, it&#39;s inexpensive and FAST.

The reason for only 4 stars (instead of 5)?  It&#39;s a bit dingy.  They need to vacuum, they need new chairs, and their bathroom needs to be improved.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is EMPTY and they seem to do most of their business for take out and catering.  Still, if they dimmed the lights, put on some low music, and cleaned up the place a bit, they&#39;d do much better.  

All in all, GREAT FOOD and the best kept secret in the western burbs."

This is THE BEST place for Indian food that we have ever found, hands down. We go there regularly and order many different things, and we have never had anything that wasn&#39;t absolutely delicious! It&#39;s all fresh and freshly-made, and the owner (Ashok) is super nice and always comes over to talk to us. We love the samosas, the paneer dishes, the meat dishes, and my husband is in love with the masala tea. The Cashmiri naan is amazing. Actually, their naan is the best I&#39;ve ever had.

It blows India Palace (and any other Indian restaurant we&#39;re ever tried) out of the water. This place is in a slightly difficult-to-find location next to an Army Recruiting place, but you MUST find it and go.

On top of it, the pizza toppings slipped right off of the pizza. It was like they cut the crust before they put the toppings on. Every time we grabbed a piece the entire cheese/topping layer peeled off. Meh.

The girl on the phone was not very helpful either. She didn&#39;t tell me how long the wait would be or say thank you. The delivery guy was friendly at least. It took about an hour to deliver that tiny pizza on a weeknight.

A mistake. It is not a comfy place to dine, more of a take out with a few tables. It wasn&#39;t a hot evening, but was hot in there, no fan or anything. It seemed to take a long time to cook &amp; they weren&#39;t all that busy. The delivery guys were taking one pizza at a time to deliver. The guy behind the counter was great &amp; helpful, but the pizza came to the table in a take out box which I guess kept it warm longer but was very cumbersome at a small table.

We asked for the thinnest pizza they had. It was a 1/4 inch thick. Not thin at all. The sauce was not slightly spicy as Terri said &amp; nothing special either. I would rate it just average. I got half onions on it that were skimpy, diced &amp; still crunchy, UGH ! My husband got gyro&#39;s (off the spit) which seemed plentiful enough &amp; he said it was good.

And while Vini&#39;s is not the best &#39;za I&#39;ve tasted, they offer deep dish and deliver via GrubHub, and that&#39;s a standout in my book. I can only speak to their delivery (two occasions)...

And here are some important notes...
1) On the most recent occasion, the delivery man was completely clueless that our order had been submitted via GrubHub, so he asked my husband a few times to be paid. I promise, sir, we&#39;re not trying to sleight you...your tip is already on our order.

2) The deep dish is a little flavorless. I added crushed red pepper, garlic powder and black pepper to spice it up a bit. However, the &#39;za was none too greasy and cooked just right. My pizza seemed almost (emphasis on the almost) healthy. 

3) Their menu is pretty extensive with plenty of crust variants, toppings and more. They also have a multitude of sandwiches, pastas and wings. 

I&#39;ll likely give Vini&#39;s another go around via GrubHub but I&#39;m not rushing to do so."

So I order the extra thin pizza because I&#39;ve discovered the NW burbs idea of thin pizza really is more of a medium crust.  Wow...was I pleasantly surprised when this comes out as paper thin as pizza can be without being floppy.  The crust was perfect, the sauce has a delightful slightly spicy flavor and the cheese was perfectly cooked - not too brown.  This is now my fav pizza in the area...5 stars!

Fired up my Samsung Galaxy tablet and saw that Vini&#39;s Pizza had some good reviews so I figured what the heck, eh?

I ordered the baked spaghetti and beer nuggets.  I&#39;m from PA so I have no idea what &#34;beer nuggets&#34; are but they sound tasty.  They actually were!  Seems to be just a small piece of pizza dough dipped in batter and deep-fried.  I got 10 of these little cuties in a bag.  How come they didnt have these cheap tasty snacks when I was a broke college student 20 yrs. ago?

The baked spaghetti was quite delicious and a rather large portion for $7.00.  I&#39;m 6&#39;2&#34;, 240 and used to play outside linebacker in my younger years so I know how to throw down some grub!  It&#39;s nice they added 3 or 4 well-cooked meatballs to the order just like I asked.  Washed it all down with a cold Corona Light I bought at the Speedway store down the street.

One bad note was that they packed the spaghetti in a container and then put in sideways in the brown paper bag!  A little bit of sauce dripped out and made the bag soggy, and it could&#39;ve been a total disaster if the lid popped off and the entire spaghetti pile fell into the bag.  Somebody who prepares delivery orders at this place needs to grow a few IQ points, OK?

Also, the delivery kid was driving a brand new white Cadillac Escalade with moonroof --- is the pizza business doing that well in Chi-Town?"

It was a little shy of amazing. Christina S. was right- the gyro platter is hefty! 

We HAVE had bigger Italian Beef sandwiches that were bigger for less (we ordered the bubba beef) and the wings were supposed to come with celery but did NOT. Since we ordered 21 wings, it was a very disappointing experience to not have the celery we were promised on Vini&#39;s menu description. 

The moral of this story is to include the request for celery and get the regular beef sandwich if we order from there again. Over-all, it was a decent meal, but if I was dining in, they would have been on-point. Bummer."

They are fast, consistent and friendly.  I have never had a problem with the food here, or any employee.  

I did, however, have a small issue with delivery once.  There was a misunderstanding between the person taking the order, and myself.  They thought I was coming to pick it up, and I thought it was being delivered.    I got a phone call about 20 minutes later asking when I would be there.  I took this as a good sign--they called right when the pizza came out of the oven, not when it had been sitting there for 20 minutes!  I told them I thought it was being delivered.  The employee explained to me that he would be happy to deliver it,  but it would take 30 minutes (bears game).  I just decided to pick it up.  To my surprise, they did not charge me a dime.   In addition, the next time I went in for pizza, they gave it to me for half price, and thanked me for my business.  

I have had salads, fettuchini, breads, and sandwiches here.  All of them are made correctly and carefully.  

I would reccomend carry out, as the seating area is nothing special---plastic tables and chairs.  The seating area is always clean though.  They also offer a good lunch special, a huge slice and a can of pop for 2 dollars.  The pizza changes daily, so call ahead!!!

UPDATE 10/10/07.  Tried to get delivery again.  MISTAKE.  Pizza was COLD on arrival.  We paid for toppings and got a cold, plain cheese pizza.  It was embarassing because we had guests.

The sauce was flavorful and the toppings were tasty and apparently fresh. I added a soda and it was just what I had in mind.

After I was finished with lunch, I bought a box of cookies to take home to have after dinner. (Thanks to Candace for the suggestion!) Counterman extraordinaire Sam suggested a couple other varieties of cookie, and it was fun to have a selection. We tried at least one of each of the three varieties that I purchased, and to be quite honest, I would have a hard time picking a favorite- each type had a certain character and texture that made them interesting and enjoyable.

Anything  and everything here is fresh and fantastic. This is a favorite lunch spot for a quick and painless in and out!  Sherry is always smiling and happy to help!  Kid friendly as well business appropriate. Order, seat yourself and your meal is brought out to you. There is always a hot pot of coffee and ice water, complimentary. If you are looking for a traditional, old school Italian eatery this is LIGIT!"

Worth every penny! Fate brought me to Fausto&#39;s.

Seriously, walking into this Italian deli (ironically having just come from the vegan Pure Juice Cafe across the parking lot), was a feast for the eyes. Everything in the case looked inviting and delicious. I think it was Sam that helped me (sorry if I am not remembering the correct name), and he was so friendly and helped me make my choices. I knew I was getting the stuffed peppers soup because earlier that morning, I got a shoe fitting at the running store, and one of the employees was eating that soup. It smelled so good I had to ask her and she happily filled me in on Fausto&#39;s. Fate.

Sam recommended the meatballs with sauce, and also the sausage with onions and peppers, and further, mixing the two together. It was a great idea. I picked these up Thursday afternoon, and Saturday night reheated them in the oven for about 15 minutes on 400, soup on the stovetop. I also couldn&#39;t resist the homemade rosemary and sea salt focaccia bread. We popped that in the oven right on the grate for 5 minutes, having cooked some dry pasta from our pantry to go with it all for our dinner. Perfect, like I had just freshly baked it! You can tell the sausage and meatballs are homemade, good flavors and soft textures. The meatball was particularly light, and I think it was baked not fried, bonus. I like a little more flavor punch, maybe more fennel, but these were no doubt delicious in their own rite. The sauce was good, but nothing spectacular. The soup, however, tasted amazing and just like my sister&#39;s stuffed peppers but in soup form; savory, comforting and full of perfectly balanced flavors. And my favorite item was probably that buttery focaccia. I am definitely getting that again, maybe in the dangerous larger size next time. Maybe not, since it would be hard to not overindulge. Seriously, get the focaccia. 

It&#39;s impressive that 2 days later, everything tasted fresh and perfect, like I had just finished creating it with love in my kitchen, even the focaccia! Except, I&#39;m pretty sure nothing this tasty was created in my kitchen. My takeout order was a quart of soup, a couple links with sausage and peppers, a couple meatballs with sauce, and a small round loaf of focaccia, and I think it was just under $20, feeding 2-3 people (including our own pasta). I have to say, I am going to do this more often for an inexpensive and delicious meal to whip up at home. Highly satisfying. I&#39;m telling you, it was fate!"

And while I don&#39;t want to give away too much (you really should experience it for yourself), I will say that I can&#39;t wait to get F&#39;d again! It was my first time in what will hopefully be frequent and habitual weekly F-ings in the A(arlington Heights).

There&#39;s just so much to choose from and everything looks like it&#39;s been plucked from the heavens and escorted down by some Italian food angel (probably named Angelo) to this little kitchen and counter service shop that your old-world Italian grandmother would surely approve of. 

On my visit, I split a giant (and I do mean GIANT) slice of pizza and one of Fausto&#39;s cheesy, gooey spinach arancini balls with public enemy (of my diet) #1 and pusher of all things habit forming, Nicole W. We both ate like kings for just a hair over $10 and topped everything off with what might be the greatest food invention ever. F*ck sliced bread, Italian turtle cookies are where.it&#39;s.at. I was mid conversation, b*tching about my usual Candice problems when I took my first bite and had a very involuntary moment where my eyes just rolled into the back of my head in a state of pure bliss. 

When you come here (and I know you will), don&#39;t even bother ordering those turtle cookies by the single digit numbers unless you&#39;re planning on following it up with the word &#39;dozen&#39;. 

Example:
&#34;Hi! I&#39;d like to order 8 Italian turtle cookies to take home, please.&#34; --- WRONG!
&#34;Hi! I&#39;d like to order 8 dozen Italian turtle cookies to take home, please.&#34; --- Getting better.
&#34;Hi! I&#39;d like to order 8 dozen Italian turtle cookies that I&#39;m going to pretend are to take home, but actually plan on eating in my car before I&#39;m out of the parking lot.&#34; --- NOW we&#39;re talking! 

Take my advice: Get F&#39;d!"

I can&#39;t say yesterday was my first time with Fausto&#39;s...we&#39;ve been seeing each other for weeks now and I can finally come out and say how much I am in love with this place. Why? Let me count the ways...

1) Amazing food. Seriously - I have yet to eat anything I haven&#39;t adored. Arancini, pizza slices as big as a toddler, ooey gooey (high addicting) turtle cookies, cannolis, homemade salads and more. It&#39;s living in an Italian paradise and everything is homemade. 

2) Super sweet service. It&#39;s mostly family run from the cooking to the cashiers. They&#39;ll let you sample and most certainly make you feel at home here whether you&#39;re taking a slice to go, pop in every 4 days for turtle cookie (ahem, me) or grab a sandwich and have a seat in their casual dining room. 

3) It&#39;s affordable! CG and I split a piece of giant pizza, an arancini and a few turtles for $10. That&#39;s a beautiful thing. 

4) They deliver! I&#39;m not sure of the area, but definitely check it out and give them a call if you&#39;re looking for a homecooked meal. 

Fausto&#39;s, this is the start of a gorgeous relationship."

There are all sorts of potentially delicious entrees in a display case, but all of them looked like they had been cooked much earlier in the day and had been sitting out.  You know how cheese looks after it&#39;s been sitting around for hours?  That&#39;s everything there, including a whole pizza.  I knew that if I ordered anything I could see, I would just be getting a reheated disappointment, so I went for the Italian beef sandwich and my wife ordered a margherita panini.  Hard to mess those up, right?

Sadly, my Italian beef was extremely mediocre.  I won&#39;t say it was bad -- it wasn&#39;t -- but it was the kind of thing I&#39;d expect from a school lunch.  I asked for cheese, they didn&#39;t even bother to melt it on.  And the quantity of beef was extremely small, maybe 1/2 inch of meat which seemed to have been put in a toaster oven for two minutes.  The bread was fine, but nothing I can&#39;t get at any grocery store.  I can get a far better sandwich at Portillo&#39;s, Buona Beef, or Potbelly for less money.

My wife&#39;s panini was sadder.   There wasn&#39;t much cheese, and the basil?  One small leaf (see the photo).  That was insulting.  I honestly could make a better sandwich at home, and I can barely fry an egg.  We paid $6.99.

As if all that weren&#39;t disappointing enough, our can of Coke was $1.49, and it was flat.  How do you mess up a can of Coke?  Fausto&#39;s managed.

I debated whether this was a 1 or 2 star review, because when I give something 1 star, it has to be pretty bad.  The food we had was certainly edible and did not taste horrible or make us sick.  But ultimately I would never return, and I think that&#39;s worth a single star.

I will allow for one possibility: this place might be far better at lunch time when I assume all of this food is fresh.  But even if it were, I can&#39;t help but think that what we received was effectively cafeteria food that is easily beaten by local fast food chains.  I&#39;m going to stop putting so much faith in yelp reviews after this."

Maybe it&#39;s because their location is tucked back into parking lot, but I never really gave them much mind. Lately, though, I&#39;ve gotten bored of the usual go-to&#39;s and took a chance.

I&#39;ve stopped in for lunch a couple times now and had good experiences every time; always did take-out, and never thought to call ahead. The service was always quick, and friendly enough. The salads and soups have been tasty, and the hot subs piping hot. I don&#39;t seem to be capable of getting out of there for less than $20, tho.

First of all, I felt like I walked into an episode of &#34;What would you do?&#34;  The owner was yelling at an employee just behind the door to the kitchen.  That same employee stormed out to the counter and abruptly asked me or my order.  My bad...I wasn&#39;t ready.  He stormed back to the kitchen...more yelling...then he stormed out the front door.  Then he stormed back in....more yelling...then the owner fired him.

Finally, a calm, friendly young man took my order.  I ordered the very bland and pricey tuna sub for the dining room.  He told me I could pay on the way out because I knew I would be ordering gelato to go.  The owner had the nerve to come looking for me in the dining room...probably to make sure I didn&#39;t do a dine and dash.

So, I go to pay for my sandwich and order my gelato, and the owner is all snarky with me.  Well...welcome to Yelp, Mr. Snarky.  The gelato was good, hence the once star."

Either way, it&#39;s definitely worth it to walk over to Fausto&#39;s.  It has 2 entrances but use the one on the west with the countertop for ordering.

They have a great selection of hot and cold sandwiches along with some prepared salads, pizzas, breads, and desserts.  My friend had the italian beef pizza which had slices of italian beef and hot giardineira.  I had a sicilian slice of their veggie pizza, which is something I normally don&#39;t order but it was chock-full of toppings.  Mine had plenty of mushrooms, spinach, onions, peppers, zucchini, but most of all, it  was really tasty.  I tried the italian beef pizza and the spiciness really added to the italian beef and cheese along with the thin crust.  When I was about to pay, I saw that their rosemary sea salt focaccia was quite cheap at $1.25.  I took it home and made a great sandwich the next day with it.  The staff was really cool with us and gave us a few goodies to take home since we came at the end of the night.  Overall, a place I definitely want to return to when it&#39;s busier to get a better feel for the ambience."

The bread is 5 stars (more if possible).  The food is 4 stars.

But, a great baker does not a great retailer or restauranteur make; nor do children (the most apt description of the young people often behind the counter).

Be prepared:

To pay the &#34;food per pound price&#34; for packaging - no taring out
( i.e $7.95 lb.or more per pound for plastic containers);

To pay a surcharge for using a credit card;

And if you call be prepared for them to answer and put you on hold indefinitely (literally).

Last caveat: The bread goes fast - get there early.  

Buon Appetito!"

Wife decided to look at some boutiques and I was obviously thrilled (sarcasm) with that idea, so I thought I would checkout this Italian deli nearby for a cannoli. The rest is history. 

Over the last few months I&#39;ve been a weekly visitor of Faustos. The treats are awesome, including the cannolis and my favorite, turtles! &#34;Boom&#34; on the turtles. My wife even asked for them for here baby shower at nearby Francesca&#39;s...so good!

I&#39;ve had their arancinis, the artichokes, their eggplant parm and my favorite...their pizza. We always get the pesto pizza, which comes with ricotta, tomatoes and onions. I love that they cut the pizza in squares too! I usually come in and order a pizza and grab something from the deli case to munch on while I wait.

With so many great local businesses in Arlington Heights, Faustos is definitely one Italian family-owned business I&#39;m happy to support (weekly in my case)!"

I want to support small business, downtown, non-chain eateries, whenever I can.  I loved the concept that this was an authentic deli, with fresh, Italian food.  I had meant to go here for a couple of years but just didn&#39;t get around to it.  So, last month, I finally trekked over to Fausto&#39;s.  In one month, I have frequented Fausto&#39;s, 3 times.  I shall not return.  3 STRIKES AND YOU ARE OUT.
Trip #1:  I looked at their menu, online and became quite excited.  I adore fresh, Italian food.  This stuff sounded scrumptious!  So, I drove to Fausto&#39;s, with a loose idea of what I wanted.  When I arrived, I noticed how small it was.  No worries :)  This would just add to the charm of the&#34;deli&#34; feel, right?  NO.  It was pretty empty, at lunchtime, because the place is very unpredictable, inconsistent and CLEARLY run by someone who doesn&#39;t understand the &#34;business&#34; end of running a cafe&#39;.   The menu is handwritten, sloppily, on a few chalk boards.  I could not find, on the chalkboard, what I had seen on their online menu.  I looked in the deli case, which resembles a grocery store deli counter, where the staff is standing behind, between you and the kitchen.  The salads, especially the tuna, looked crusted over and old.  The lasagna looked very fresh, though.  Some things had been sitting out for a long time and others looked fresh-baked.  Inconsistent.  So, I thought I would be safe an order a panini.  Boy, did I want that panini.  I waited, a clear, 4 minutes, for someone to come out of the kitchen to wait on me.  I was met by a gruff, young man who called me &#34;Hun&#34; during every opportunity he had.  After ordering, he took my money and I went to eat, outside.  A few, minutes later, the gruff man came out and tossed at me a plastic plate with the smallest, thinnest, panini I had ever seen made.  I could of made a better sandwich at home!  No garnish on the plate, no care, no nothing.  Oh, and he took this time to call me &#34;hun&#34; one, last time.  Maybe this young guy thought he was working at a retro diner?  I decided that one time did not make an accurate judgement, of this place. I REALLY WANTED TO DIG THIS PLACE!
Trip #2:  A week later, I wanted to go back and order something different.  I remembered that veggie lasagna I saw on the online menu.  It did look good, in the case, when I was there, last.  So, I invited 2 friends to meet me there, for lunch.  I ordered the spinach lasagna (there was no veggie available).  When I was prepared to pay, before sitting down, like last week, I was told to sit down and the food would be brought, to me.  So, my one friend comes after me, orders pizza and is told the same, &#34;sit down and I will bring it to you&#34; without her paying, first.  Then, my other friend arrives.  As I am sitting in the dining room, and cannot see the counter, I am assuming that she was told the same thing (since she was dining in), to sit and pay, later.  My spinach lasagna, of course, was reheated.  I knew this, for it came from the deli counter.  That being said, it was delicious and the sauce so fresh.  I believe the owner (an Italian man) asked us how we liked the meal.  I did not mention that the plastic plates really &#34;cheapen&#34; the experience.  Deli or not, having hot food on plastic is not, really safe (BPA releases).  So, I wanted to treat my friends, without them knowing.  So, when we were done eating, I snuck up to the counter, found the same, gruff &#34;Hun&#34; guy and asked him to have me pay for all, 3 lunches, so I could treat my friends without them raising a fuss.  So, he charged me for the 3 meals.  I came back to the table, told my friends that &#39;LUNCH IS ON ME, TODAY&#34; with a smile.  My 2nd friend said, &#34;wait, what are you talking about?  I paid for my lunch after I ordered for it, at the counter&#34;.   GREAT.  The restaurant was, virtually, empty.  I find it hard to believe &#34;gruff man&#34; got things confused!  So, I walked up to the counter and asked for the $$ back for my 2nd friend.  At this point, my wanting to pay for lunch became tacky and weird.  What was I going to do, at this point?  Give my friend cash for her lunch?  Again, no CONSISTENCY.  
Trip #3  In spite of all that had happened, that spinach lasagna I had, during trip, #2 was delicious.  Yesterday, I wanted another slice.  So, fool that I am, I went back to Fausto&#39;s.  I asked for the spinach lasagna (after waiting about 4 min., again, as staff passed me by, from the kitchen window, not acknowledging me or seeing if I needed help).  Who should, eventually, come out of the kitchen &#34;hole&#34;?  The gruff, &#34;Hun&#34; young man!  So, I gave him my order, (spinach lasagna) and added a small, caprese salad.  My friend had one, on Trip #2, and it looked fresh and delicious.  Yesterday?  Disgusting. A rumor of balsamic.  Old, mushy tomatoes. Mozzarella had that pungent, not fresh smell.  I was afraid of being sick.

I probably should have gone with my gut and ordered some of the appetizing selections in the deli case (chicken parm, lasagana, or chicken marsala looked good).

Not too bad. The house didn&#39;t really have much taste to it. We paid 5.99 and 6.99 if you ask me it&#39;s a bit expensive to not even get a side or a drink. Most Deli&#39;s at least include a small side.

First time in we had the delicious pizza, chicken artichoke salad and a House Favorite sandwich.  This time I again ordered the House Favorite.  The bread is beyond fresh.  Fresh mozzarella is always welcomed along with high quality prosciutto.  The arancini was also amazing.  This place needs to be packed at all times.  Why it isn&#39;t ill never know.  Mmmmm!"

I love this place. There are many ways to describe the superlatives of Fausto&#39;s but quite simply, the food is exceptional and the Chef and management are constantly working to better their offerings. 

Case in point is the pizza. The pizza is perhaps the best I&#39;ve had, and I&#39;ve ate pizza in almost every major city. I would recommend the giardenera and Italian beef - just try it and you&#39;ll be astonished at how unique and absolutely delicious it is. I&#39;ve been wondering if my taste buds are bias, so I&#39;ve introduced this place to every guest I&#39;ve had in town and the judgement is unanimous, the food is stellar. 

Everything about this place is stellar: the food, the desserts, the staff (particularly Aldo, who always ensures feedback and service are up-to-par), and the creativity with re-vamping Italian classics. I can appreciate this place on a different level as I live across the street and go there almost everyday. I see the establishment is fully owned and operated by Aldo&#39;s family, who put their all into ensuring their food is the best around, and it comes across in the food. Just try it. Mind blown! 

I&#39;m never overly-enthusiastic about any given place, but since moving to AH, I&#39;ve been able to fully test the strengths and weaknesses of local restaurants/delis and without a doubt, Fausto&#39;s comes through on all levels. 

Fausto&#39;s has all the rights characteristics to succeed, I sure hope anyone who reads this will try their food. 

The desserts are amazing. I would recommend their cookies. I really don&#39;t like certain cookies, but after getting them for my (then pregnant) wife, I was unable to stop and actually went back for more that night. 

Without a doubt, please try the Pizza, Italian Beef sandwich and cookies. Delicioso!"

Aldo from Fausto&#39;s is Buddy Valastro&#39;s cousin (Cake Boss).  Buddy was there for the grand opening &#34;under cover&#34;.  I went there today to taste the &#34;bonta&#34; (goodness) created by his works, and it was amazing.  The flavors brought me back to my homeland...the place of my birth.  Aldo was gracious and kind, and the food generous and flavorful.

If you want the real deal, this is the place.  And for the lady who didn&#39;t get her &#34;extra sauce&#34; on her eggplant parm two weeks in a row...you&#39;ll get it.  Italy isn&#39;t about &#34;slam your fist on the counter....get it your way...service&#34;.  It is about genuine flavor and real personality.

It had always been there but I never thought of it for catering.  I had just gotten a new job where I was going to need to cater often and boy am I glad I put two and two together.  It was little time before I got to know Aldo the new owner, who kept the same old world recipies but injected new energy into the store with later hours and a can-do attitude.  Aldo, and his family there are &#34;off the boat&#34; Italian, which means great recipies, great personalized service, and great accountability... which in the catering world is clutch. As far as the food goes , I saw the review of Sara A. and agree the food looks great but truthfully sometimes can be hit or miss.  I feel like some of the recipies need tweaking.  Also, the pricing on their sodas for catering makes me have to buy two liters which is annoying.  Otherwise, they more than make up for it in the service... and the meatballs and sausage caccitore play very well for my offices.  Their sandwiches are good and so is their pizza.  They are getting a new wood fired stove and I swear if they extend their hours even further on the weekends, that they will get such a bar rush they won&#39;t know what hit them. Aldo is smart.  I see this place on a pretty drastic upswing from good to great and ESPECIALLY with ALL of the surrounding restaurants being so high priced, I would highly recommend stopping in a few times to witness the ascent.

Lately I&#39;ve been searching for a deli or sub joint that isn&#39;t a chain for a couple months now (I&#39;ve exhausted all of the restaurants in Rolling Meadows/ Schaumburg area). I found this place and I convinced some of my coworkers to come with. Low and behold it was awesome. I got 2 slices of their sausage pizza and they were amazing. My one coworker got a tilapia sandwich and he said it was very good and my other coworker got the eggplant parm sandwich and he said it was good too. That bread is really really good and fresh. one of those places where you can tell they make everything at home. Not to mention when you order the guy yells back in the kitchen in Italian. That&#39;s how you know its good. We talked to the manager Sam for a little bit, real cool guy. The next day at work it was a no brainer where we&#39;re going for lunch. I ordered the Italian sub. once again amazing bread and a perfect balance of oil/meat/cheese/veg. Yeah this place rules and to be honest I would bet everything on their menu is really good. I&#39;m coming back next week for sure. One of those places where you can tell everything is fresh and not half a**ed. Very clean place to eat, cool staff, amazing food. What else is there? Very homie, small business/real people feel to it, not some teenager behind a counter hating his job deal like most of the chains. I&#39;m gonna have to try a connoli next time i go. Bakery is probably really good i could imagine."

They have a great selection of deli meats and unique cheeses.
They also have many baked goods. 
Also you can order a giant cannoli filled with many mini cannolis. 

I got the House special combo with salad.
 The sub was okay. I&#39;ll try something else next time.
My sister got the Grilled chicken panini.
It was yummy and had some hidden eggplant inside and pesto sauce.

My only gripe is the combo meals are only served with a side salad or with soup. And the good soups go fast during lunch hour. 

I am planning on coming back and trying something new.
Maybe the pizza or pasta?"

Not wanting to just go to Panera for the umpteenth time that week, I drove around until I found Fausto&#39;s, which has a storefront so small it was like finding the entrance to Narnia. 

Fausto&#39;s has a definite deli feel to it, with various Italian meats and cheeses in a display case right in front when you walk in. They also appear to make a variety of desserts as well as pre-made dinners and appetizers. 

As far as sandwiches, I definitely recommend the House Special, which if my memory serves is hot capricola. proscutto, salami and mozzarella on a very crusty and delicious Italian bread. This place is a great local solution for a quick lunch fix or as a source for sandwich making at your own house! All in all, not a bad find."

Their subs are very well priced and delicious!  The chicken parm sandwich is awesome!  I could probably eat 5 of them with a big smile on my face... ok, maybe not, but I wish I could it is so good!  The focaccia is wonderful as well... I love the salty rosemary one!

I think their location is bad for business... kind of hard to find tucked away in Evergreen plaza in downtown arlington heights.  Easy parking though.

Their &#34;to go&#34; lasagne and other items are wonderful as well.  They close at 5 or 6pm, so you have to buy them early for dinner, but they&#39;re great heated up.    

Their cookies and canoli&#39;s are great!

NOTE TO OWNERS:
Just an idea for you... I recently lived in Italy for almost 3 years and there is a &#34;chain&#34; of restaurants that serves up the most delicious foccacia.  They make all sorts of foccacia and you can buy a &#34;slice&#34; cold or heated up just like you do a pizza.  They had amazing combinations, all sorts of options... the store is packed at lunch and dinner and almost all times of the day!  Seems like something that would work well for you considering you already have some foccacia&#39;s, just get creative and serve individual slice options!

Also... I&#39;d love to see an insalada di riso now that summer is here!"

The french bread is made fresh, so it has the crispy crust I love.  There are a number of delicious little side dishes to choose from, and they can be ordered deli-style.

A PLAIN BEEF WITH NOTHING ON IT. so there would be no more confusion. they were very courteous and brought my food within about 15 min, but when i took a look, there was the beef with all the fixings AGAIN.  like really guys? how hard is it to make a PLAIN ROAST BEEF SANDWICH. obviously quite difficult. like i said, service was good, employees were polite, and they brought me new food with no questions asked. oh yeah, and i got 2 combo orders and they forgot my chips :/ i dunno. even though the food was decent, i wouldnt order from here again. sorry :/"

The gentleman at the front was very kind and promptly seated us. It&#39;s a little on the small side but you know what they say, good things come in small packages.

My son and I both ordered my favorite, a Chicken Flautas Dinner. The food came really quick. It was fresh and hot.

My flautas were crunchy with moist tender chicken filling that was perfectly seasoned. My dinner came with a side of mexican rice and beans also perfectly seasoned not too salty and not bland. The sauce our server brought was a light green sauce and a creamy one, they were super delicious with perfect balance of heat and flavor!! My son had the Horchatta, which was disappointing because I don&#39;t think it was homemade but a powder mix.

Also ordered a steak burito dinner for the hubs to go. I&#39;m not a fan of steak, but this steak was so good. It tasted like it was fire grilled and the burito was pretty big and nicely stuffed. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t take a pic. Next time.

Located in a shopping center off Algonquin, it&#39;s pretty easy to find. Parking isn&#39;t an issue at all. Once entering, you&#39;re immediately greeted and told to take a seat wherever you please. The inside of the restaurant is small and has an up-to-date atmosphere.

Once seated they bring over free chips and salsa. The ingredients they use are always fresh and you can taste it in the salsa. I&#39;ve tried multiple menu items for lunch but find myself ordering tacos the most.

Definitely a hole in the wall, the employees are always very nice and I would (and have) recommended this place to countless people. I should also mention that we&#39;re from San Diego and my husband is Mexican. We know good burritos. If you&#39;re in the area, you have to try it.

The chips and salsa was very good but I don&#39;t like it spicy so it may not be good for others. The quesadillas were boring. The guacamole was ok but a little too much lime. The burrito was good if all you want is meat. Little else was added. The cheese would have been better inside the burrito.
The cheese has to be ordered extra. Overall not that great."

Had the gobi 65 as a starer.. Huge portion.. Medium spicy, would rate it 5/5
Had their chicken chetinad gravy with naan 
And a mutton pan biryani for the main course
Firstly their servers need to brush up on listening skills otherwise they are good! You have to repeat you order 2-3 times as the server kept saying sorry what sir, pardon sir! 

Ok now to the food
The chetinad chicken is nice but not the best I have had. Their gravy was good. Spicy, moderate amount of spices and authentic with no compromise on flavors! Although here is the catch, the chicken pieces were that great! Lacked salt if had with a little gravy also! Probably don&#39;t use the best quality meat! Too much skin and didn&#39;t seem very very fresh! Overall average 
The naan were pathetic!! Thin and seemed more like a papad! Garlic naan was worse for that matter
The pan biryani probably was not the best thing to order on weekends as they have special dum biryani served on weekends and the chef decided to burn you tongue and tummy in anger!!! 
The rice surely wasn&#39;t biryani rice( basmati) 
Steamed rice pan fried with some meat from the biryani they made for weekends with additional spices and probably heaps of chili powder!!!!!!! 
I only could curse myself that night for eating that! 

I have heard from few friends that the food is great but had a bad experience and would love to give them another chance in the future though!

Forget the ambience, the place and even the service. When i arrived there on a sunday afternoon the place was packed and that got my taste buds watering because there is no better sight than a packed place when you drive 30 miles to eat at a restaurant and unsure if it is worthwhile. 

We wanted to order some drinks, the guy who waited on us politely set the table with spoon and fork (again typical indian!! no Knife) and two glasses of iced water and moved on to set the next table, No question if we wanted to see the   menu to ask for drinks!! Also never mind if we wanted to order from the Ala carte or not, he made the choice for us. So we set off for the buffet, My wife a vegetarian tried their uttapam (mediocre) egg puff, chutneys and i went for the tandoori chicken and masala chicken wings. This set the tone for the rest of the buffet. This is definitely a great dining option inspite of the mediocre idles, dosas and nan. It simply makes up with the great tasting entrees.

No one ever came to our table to greet us; we figured out that we should go ahead and serve ourselves.  No one ever came to ask if we wanted something besides water to drink.  The poor bus boy was run ragged, and he did a good job, but that&#39;s the only employee that ever came to our table.  The food was also not what I hoped for.  I&#39;m familiar with many dishes and recognized some, but unfortunately, there were some that were new to me and only about 10% of everything was labeled.  I&#39;m reasonably adventurous, so I tried many unlabeled things, but I felt like the dishes were filled with heat and skimped out on flavor.  Even tried and true dishes tasted nothing like I expected.  At $15.18 for one, without any drinks, I consider this place to be grossly overpriced for what I got.  We will not be back."

I used to go to this place for different curries etc and then it is just getting disappointing every time ; one time I requested the chicken pieces to be smaller ; the chefs are just dumping un-flavorful meat in a curry sauce which not going to saturate the meat ; I want the chef to eat the piece of meat he/she serves in parcel in one bite ; I am sure they will throw up ...
I have to make sure that this gets out ; all Indian restaurants die doing such kind of business ; they are trying to save up on spice cost etc. and serve inexpensive large chunks of meat .
if we want to eat big pieces of un-flavorful meat I would go to any american fast food any days hardees; kfc, etc. etc.

Mouth watering biryani and the spicy mutton curry with puri, the best among the buffet. The biryani and the gravy curries are extra spicy and I enjoyed eating such a spicy food. I felt like I was eating the food back in Andhra.
And for sure it will be burning on your palate, if you are habituated to eat moderate spicy food.

I have been waiting for Naan and chicken for 40 mins during Buffet. I was keep asking you were saying it will be ready in 5 mins and we are bringing in a min. At last I got pissed of off and frustrated and paid the money with out eating anything. You people are sick and sucks to the core. You may have lot of time to waste but not customers. I would never ever recommend anyone to come to your restaurant and also I will never come nor I will let my friends come to this place.

So we figured we&#39;d get Indian food before going to the club. I picked out this place from Yelp because it had the best reviews in the area.

Fast forward to a few hours later as I&#39;m writing this review in my head while waiting for the comedy club waitress to bring us overpriced burgers and nachos... because at Cool Mirchi WE NEVER EVEN MADE IT TO THE F&#39;ING MEAL.

When we get there, things look good. Easy parking. The place smells great. Semi-crowded with Indian families, and it&#39;s always a good sign for a restaurant when people who are native to that cuisine choose to dine there. So, we get seated, handed menus and water, and we&#39;re psyched.

A few minutes later the waiter comes to take our order, and we already know what we want. No problem, order placed. We&#39;ve now been here 5 minutes, maybe less.

Now the place is getting a little busier... in fact, soon it&#39;s nearly packed. It&#39;s been about 10 minutes now. We start noticing little things: the pictures on the wall are all slightly crooked. The table and fixtures are smeared with grease. A bunch of loose wires sticking out of the wall, wrapped in masking tape, and painted over. A random paint can is just sitting against a wall in the dining room. The whole place is just... dingy.

But, no big deal, we&#39;re hungry enough to not care. Another 10 minutes go by. The waiter passes our table, bringing appetizers to people that arrived after us. We give him an inquiring look, and he says &#34;two minutes.&#34; M. is slightly annoyed that another table is getting food, but I reason that we didn&#39;t order appetizers so it&#39;s not a problem. Two more minutes. We&#39;re so hungry! Can&#39;t wait.

Ten more minutes go by. It dawns on us that there is only one waiter. On a Saturday night. In a packed restaurant. Although it&#39;s not his fault, this is just poor planning. So, M. gets up and walks to the front counter to politely ask what&#39;s up. &#34;Two minutes,&#34; she&#39;s told simply.

She sits down. It&#39;s been half an hour, we&#39;re starving, and at this point we&#39;re assessing how much time we can spend on the actual meal in order to to get to the show on time.  At any other spot we&#39;d be halfway through our Chana Masala by now.

Five minutes later, dude walks by again. &#34;Two minutes,&#34; he says, bringing appetizers to yet another table. Clearly time operates differently in this strange, dingy dimension. M. says, &#34;let&#39;s give them 10 more minutes,&#34; figuring we can leave at that point and grab a slice of pizza somewhere before the show.

Ten more minutes go by. Then 11, 12, 13... The dude is nowhere to be found, a baby is crying, and we are considering mauling the other tables for their appetizers like it&#39;s 28 Days Later. Finally we get up and walk out. No attempt is made to stop us, or apologize, or even acknowledge that we were there for 48 minutes without being given so much as a pice of nan to gnaw on.

I know that things happen. Maybe a waiter called in sick. Maybe they had a new cook and that was his first day. Maybe there was an unforeseen chutney shortage and the owner had to run to Jewel-Osco to get some.

Even if all of those things were true, we should have been treated like the paying customers we were. We should have been given some kind of explanation, apology, free drink, some bread, ANYTHING more than just some idiotic &#34;two minutes&#34; mantra meaninglessly repeated to us. Instead, we lost about an hour of our lives (including the 10 minutes it&#39;s taken to write this silly review) with nothing to show for it.

I&#39;ll never go back to this place and I urge anyone reading this to avoid trying it as well- unless you are the ONLY customers, in which case you may be able to order, be served, eat, and leave before you notice the looming crapiness around you.

And oh yeah, those comedy club nachos were so, so, so, good."

When we ordered our appetizer we were waiting for our order and when we asked about it the waiter totally forgot we ordered an appetizer. Like what waiter forgets someone&#39;s order.  Next when we ordered our main course thy mixed our order up. We wanted spicy paneer tikka masala but when we ate it the paneer was sweet. When we looked at the bill it showed we ordered sweet paneer makhani. I would not recommend this restaurant. Their service is horrible they made us wait for like 30 min , maybe one day they will make us wait for like 1 or 2 hours. I&#39;ve been here before and they did it fine but today was horrible. At least we got a good discount after we told them their food is not good which was better than the food. If you go there go for the discount not the food. Like I said why would they forget the order that is crazy and the coftha curry was over spicey my mouth was about to burn like fire it was crazy.In my opinion I will tell everyone no cool mirchi"

I visited &#34;Cool Mirchi&#34; with my wife on Memorial Day weekend for dinner. It was not busy and only 1 table was occupied with 6 people there. We were seated and as soon as we sat we realized that there is very intense and bad odor in the restaurant.  We noticed that there was only 1 server, and he did not care to come to us and ask what we would like to eat/drink etc. Waiter was just busy with the 1 table and taking orders on the phone. We waited for 10 minutes and then waived at the waiter. He finally showed up and we asked for the water and the menus. Finally he gave us menus and water and never came back. Another 10 minutes then we waived at him and he ignored and was busy on the phone. One Lady, probably the chef herself, came from inside and took our order. We asked for tea and ordered our food.  Half an hour passed nothing came on our table and they did not even care to give papad or something else to fix the situation. The waiter there was only busy with the to-go orders and no one was there to serve. In the meantime 2-3 more families came in. We noticed that it has been 45 minutes since we placed the order and the family that came after us was served the food before us. I asked my wife to leave the place and when we were about to leave the place then the same lady showed up from the kitchen and told us that our food will be ready in 5 minutes. We told her that it has been more than 1 hour sitting here and sipping water, and you guys did not care to bring even our tea. She then realized that we ordered tea also. She admitted that she forgot about tea and was cooking our food. We asked that why the people who came after us are getting food before us then she replied that these guys ordered on the phone and then came here to eat. We were like WTH, anyways get us our food. Finally, the food came and chicken pieces were the worst we ever had and so tiny and ugly that looked like scavenged chicken. We did not even eat it. I just ate 2-3 bites of my naan and then the server came with our tea. We told him that the service is horrible and you were hiding in the corner and we were just trying to make an eye contact with you to ask for our food. He was such an arrogant looser that he started talking in loud voice in his broken English that he cannot stand next to your table all the time and Indian food takes time to cook blah blah. Instead of admitting the mistake that they forgot about our tea and their service needs improvement, he was trying to dictate on us. I was like go to hell dude and left cash right on the table and left."

Curry&#39;s and wet items are just OK. 

But, to go was like a 2 star. We ordered some Chicken and veg biryani. Veg was good, but the chicken biryani was really bad.

We went back there today for lunch and were so happy to see the newly remodeled kitchen and updated decor.  They&#39;ve always had 5 star food, but a few months ago, our lunch experience was anything but 5 stars.

The quality of their food is back to what it was when it first opened and that is a good thing.  Now I know why the Daily Herald gave them such a phenomenal review years ago.  Cool Mirchi&#39;s waitstaff and managers are exceptional as well, as they definitely add to the wonderful Indian dining experience.

I knew that Cool Mirchi would make a comeback and I&#39;m so glad that they did!  I never lost faith that the owners of Cool Mirchi would perhaps read my previous review or listen to some of their other loyal customers and make a change for the better.  Knowing that Cool Mirchi decided to listen to their customers&#39; concerns deserves much more than the 5 stars I&#39;ve given today!

In summary: a truly delicious, exceptional, authentic Indian dining experience that is second to none, in the city or out in the burbs.  Mouth watering entrees, delectable desserts, and specialty breads make Cool Mirchi tops in my book!

Food is still great. Just tried the Chicken 65 and 3 days later I want it again. It was spicy &amp; awesome. I guess my survivor&#39;s guide to this place is: don&#39;t expect everything on the menu to be available (I&#39;ve given up on the paneer tikka, sadly) and expect slow service."

The biggest flaw from my perspective is that it&#39;s too far to make it a realistic dining option for me. However, if you&#39;re ever out there, do check this place out and you won&#39;t be disappointed. 

Food: Rich but not oily, which is how good desi food should be. I was surprised by the fact that they have more than one style of biryani. They have Hyderabadi and Dum biryani. Most places just have one style with only the meat changing. Their malai koftas were a Hyderabadi mughlai treat, excellent texture enchanced by a piquant cashew flavored cream gravy. Their chicken fry tastes very much like good home food, Since it&#39;s an Andra restaurant, there&#39;s a lot of fish and seafood on the menu. I don&#39;t eat fish or seafood, but if you do I would imagine you&#39;ll be in for a treat. The food gets 5 stars.

Value: It&#39;s a little expensive, with dishes ranging from the mid teens to almost $20. They have a lunch buffet, and though we had an amazing dinner, I would imagine the buffet would be a better value if you can make it. In my opinion, the value issue keeps it from 5 starts; however, this is an excellent place which I would love to frequent again.

Ambiance: Nice Hyderabadi fare. no problems.

Service: quick and personal. good service

Time of my visit: Within lunch hours

I have read all the great Yelp! reviews about wings and it so happened to 60 cents special, so I figured why not!  It was not too far away from my work and I wanted to try it.

The place had a look and feel of a bar.  I knew it was a bar, but I guess I was expecting more of a dine area...

So I chose to sit by the bar.  Barkeep came by shortly after she acknowledged my presents.  Immediately, I asked her about the wings special and she offered me the menu to take a look at anyway.  I had a taste for wings and nothing would really change my mind.  I ordered 12 (must order in multiples of 6).  I took 6 smokey BBQ and 6 garlic.  Being weird-o that I am, I wanted drumsticks only and I was told no....  Not because they didn&#39;t offer drumsticks only option, they didn&#39;t offer it with the special...  Really?!  I mean really?!  WTF?! Okay, not the end of the world, but again, what is the difference between regular price and 60 cents special?!  Are ones more special than others?

Well, okay, as soon as I thought I was over this, the barkeep asked me if I wanted something to drink, water was more than fine with me.  As I watched her pour water in my plastic cup, while holding a fist full of money, she decided it was a good idea to reach for a straw with said hand full of money and put that straw in my water.... Joy!!!

The good news, my wings came out relatively fast.  That was a plus!  The wings were nothing special.  The smoking BBQ (sauce not wings, wanted to make it clear) was good, but the garlic (again sauce not the wings) was so, so.

Time came for a check...  Well, apparently there was an extra charge for the ranch (50 cents), not the end of the world, nor a big deal, but could you tell a customer, since today was a special, ranch would be 50 cents...  You told me no to drumsticks only, could have mentioned the extra charge for the range.

D-, very disappointed.  That&#39;s unfortunate I don&#39;t work too far away from there and could have been a regular..."

Service was flippant from the get-go. We ordered beers and were each given the incorrect ones. We thought it was a fluke with just my +1&#39;s.  (FYI, he told her about the error..) When my beer arrived several minutes later and in a glass with a different beer logo, I wondered if it was the GLASS that was wrong. Nope: totally wrong beer. 

Not like our waitress was ever around for us to flag her again, so we dealt with it. She was really into chatting up her regulars and she rarely stopped at our table. We had to ask a different server for the waters we asked for but didn&#39;t get.

We had been sitting, ready to order for nearly 10 minutes while our server was standing 2 tables away socializing.. In hindsight, we should have just paid for the beers and eaten elsewhere.

We ordered the following apps for dinner:
_________________________________________________

Wings - Garlic (6)

Verdict: 4.5/5
These were totally delicious! Big, crispy, and garlicky. They were pretty oily, though. 

The blue cheese that we were charged for (..which wasn&#39;t mentioned) was watery. Gross.
_________________________________________________

Wings - Medium (6)

Verdict: 3.5/5
Not as crisp as the garlic. They were relatively spicy!

So, you want ONE sauce with your 6 wings? It&#39;s going to cost you.

The ranch was fine, though.
_________________________________________________

Breaded (butterfly) Shrimp

Verdict: 4/5
Pretty good. It&#39;s clearly from frozen, but the size is large and they were crispy.
_________________________________________________

Deep Fried Avocado 

Verdict: 3/5
HUGE chunks and light batter. They were void of any crisp or seasoning (even salt!). Meh. Good idea, mediocre execution. Not worthy of the $8 pricetag.
_________________________________________________

Mozzarella Sticks

Verdict: 3.5/5
Crispy, melty.. pretty standard.
_________________________________________________

The GOOD?
+ Garlic wings
+ All of the food was HOT and fresh(ly fried).

The BAD:
- Sh!tty service
- Wrong beers x2
- .50 charge for one measly sauce, which should be free, no? (Do they need to offset revenue for &#34;60 Cent Wing Tuesday&#34;??)


I don&#39;t think I&#39;d come back UNLESS it&#39;s for the Garlic wings: those babies are the reason for the 3rd star."

We would have normally gone to Fox and Hound, but that place has closed.  For having 10 people suddenly show up, they handled it pretty well.  We happened to stopped by on a Monday, which was half price burger and $2.50 domestic bottles.  The normally priced $12 Heisenberger burger for $6 was an impressive deal!  This burger with its avocado and bacon was huge and delicious.  

The last time I was here was when this place was called Dino&#39;s.  They really did a good job redecorating and making it look good on the inside.  There are several big screen TV&#39;s around the bar.

They even had Blue Moon cinnamon horchata beer on tap at one point!"

I couldn&#39;t tell much from the outside; its in a strip mall next to a Peachwave. Inside was dingier than I imagined but it had a large area for bands and there is a decent sized patio. There was only one waitress working, both as a server and behind the bar, so service was slow. The menu isn&#39;t huge, but there were signs highlighting that brunch was served. One wall was taken up with video slot machines. We ordered an appetizer before our entrees (the nachos) and it was GIGANTIC. I ordered the steak wrap (also huge) and my husband had a burger. It&#39;s not the fanciest place nor has a huge menu, but for those times when you don&#39;t want to spend a ton of money, it would be fine."

I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect walking in. I ended up trying this place off a Groupon for $17 for $30. I&#39;ve been a little leery about trusting Groupon deals nowadays based on a few bad experiences I previously had but this seemed legit so I decided to try it anyway. Great choice!

Walked in and one of the first things that I noticed is that for a bar, this place is extremely clean for a bar. Most bars are usually on the crummy side. But not here. The floor is very neat and clean. All of the tables including the bar area was clean.

On to service. Our waitress, Michelle, was very nice and quick. No complaints there. I got the Nolan Ryan Burger. My wife got buffalo wings &amp; mozz sticks. The burger was AMAZING. Nice thick patty, good flavors and array of condiments and the pretzel bun was soft. Additionally, they had REAL, natural cut fries that were thick, not over-fried and well seasoned.

The only drawback I see here is that they don&#39;t have menus or prices anywhere so if it&#39;s ur first time here, you may have a little challenge finding what you want without asking the waitress. But definitely not a deal breaker. This place is great. I came here off a Groupon but I can EASILY see myself returning at full price! Fortunately I live only 5 minutes from here!"

1. Came here in a groupon. 17.00 for a 30.00 dollar value. At the end I ended up spending 23.00 including tips. Not shabby at all.

2. Burgers were fantastic. Wow. I had the Juan&#39;s revenge and my fiancée had the Nolan Ryan. 

3. Service was OK. I can tell they were understaffed on a Friday night. We waited a long time for service. 

4. Not sure and I could be wrong, but our waitress, who was super nice and good, went out to smoke. There was a very long period of time between us finishing our food and getting a check. I don&#39;t want to be harsh especially since she was friendly and good despite the understaffing part.

5. Bar was clean. Not a trashy bar, but a very blue collared bar. You can tell it&#39;s a regulars bar. One thing though, we can tell once we came in there was a stench that smells like cleaning solution mixed with alcohol. We got use to it and didn&#39;t sense it. I use to smell this when I worked at a nightclub back in college. Place was still clean and not trashy.

Will I be coming back to this place? Probably not. The &#34;wow&#34; factor was definitely the burgers. But that is it.

I think the service lost a star. Definitely go here once to try the burgers though.

Atmosphere great. Good music. Large variety of beers. Very clean. Super nice waitress/bartender. I ordered my burger without the pretzel bun and I was still stuffed when I finished.

It used to be Dinos.  Under new ownership, this place is actually thriving pretty well.  The atmosphere is pretty typical of a standard bar and grill.  The outdoor arrangement for seating is improved with a full adult scale jenga game.  The food is GREAT.  The BURGERS are juicy and scrumptious.  I ordered a Nolan Ryan burger that was DELICIOUS.  The kicker is the cost of such said deliciousness.  $12.99 for burger and fries.  It&#39;s a bit pricey. The alcoholic beverages are decent.  It depends on the bartender that&#39;s making them. I&#39;m not a huge drinker, so I only sampled a couple of different selections. The only downside from my visits would be the GOD AWFUL live entertainment for the evening (HORRIBLE two man band named Bad Medicine unplugged).  Other than their problematic booking issues with actual talent, this pub is a great place to go if you&#39;re looking for a smaller, less crowded atmosphere.

Wednesday March 23, my husband and I finally got our chance to break away.  We have 4 children at home, so finding anytime to get away is difficult.  We use to do a lot of Karaoke before we had children so we decided to give JAXX a call.  What a hurtful disappointment.  


My husband called first to see what time karaoke started.  The woman said 8 pm and hung up.  I wanted to make sure that they were still serving food.  I gave them a call back and asked the girl if they were still serving food she said yes.  Then I asked does that mean a full menu or after hours menu?  

The girl got frustrated on the phone and then said very meanly, &#34;you know what,... I cant hear you lady!&#34;  Then she hung up on me.  My husband said, &#34;did she really just hang up on you?&#34;  I said, &#34;yes.&#34;  We were shocked!!!  

We are both servers and never in our entire career would we have the audacity to say this to ANY potential customers.  My husband then asked me if I still wanted to go?  I said, &#34;No, if they have that kind of customer service and let their staff get away with it, I can just imagine what the kitchen would be like.&#34;  

This place is obviously not friendly.  They have a hostile staff.  If someone can not answer the phone and be pleasant, I can not imagine what the courtesy of the wait staff would be like.

I watched the STL version with interest as it was being built and even sold them some of the HVAC equipment that was installed.  I walked the property a few times before they opened and really craved what I knew would be some really tasty food.  That said, I find it more than a little bit odd that my very first visit to a Weber Grill would be anywhere other than STL.  Oh well..such is life!

A few notes about the food and experience:

+ I really appreciate the fact they got our party of four in and out so quickly!  We had a meeting to get to and I really wanted better than some chain restaurant quick-service experience.

+ Bread service with both butter and cheddar spread.  I probably could have filled my belly on that alone...

+ Slider trio - my favorite (by a long shot) was the brisket slider.  Smoky and tender meat on the same roll they provided with the bread service, just a touch of barbeque sauce.  All in all, nearly perfect execution.  Second favorite was their grilled meatloaf.  Who knew you could grill meatloaf?!?  I loved the sear marks and charcoal flavor.

- Sadly, their pulled pork fell short...by a lot.  Very little smokiness and a bit on the tough side.  I&#39;m just really glad I went for a sampler instead of just one item because I was leaning towards ordering a full-sized pulled pork sandwich and it would have left me disappointed in the whole experience.

I&#39;m guessing they offer the same menu in STL.  I suppose I&#39;ll have to go find out..."

It smells like a backyard bbq on steroids when you enter which brings back pleasant memories but might not be for everyone.   Anything off the grill is fantastic and they have a brick chicken menu item that is to die for.   If you want  little slice of heaven, order the smoked gouda mac &amp; cheese, you will not be disappointed.

We ordered the Mango lemonade and Strawberry lemonade for drinks (you can have 1 free refill). These were both tasty. We started with the brushetta appetizer. This was enough for 2 to 4 people. Also it was very good, the bread is a bit toasted with garlic spread, tomatoes, white beans, seasoning and balsamic drizzle. Very good. Also complimentary pretzel rolls were served to the table with butter and cheese-butter. These were also good.

For entrees, my mom ordered the Southwest Turkey Wrap with fries. This was a very large portion. I tried it and agree with my mom that the flavor of the tortilla didn&#39;t go great with the contents inside. With this said it wasn&#39;t bad, would have been great as a salad. 

I ordered the salmon salad with beets, goat cheese, and pecans. I asked for the salmon to be grilled. It was served more like a spinach, goat cheese, and pecan salad on one side of the plate and the beets and salmon on the other. However, I haven&#39;t tried beets before but I&#39;m not really a fan; this didn&#39;t make the salad not good. The salad part was good and the salmon was very tasty.

I love the vibe of this place. You enter the restaurant and right away, you are introduced to a series of fired up charcoal grills and the smell of delicious steaks on the grill. Yes, it&#39;s a mouthwatering entrance.

Last night, I tried their prime rib and again, it was delicious though cooked a little more than what I asked for.  It was served with garlic mashed potatoes which tasted good. For dessert, I had their seasonal creme brulee (chocolate) and it was the highlight of my meal!

Upon entry, there was the &#34;bar&#34; area, and then the more intimate dining room. It was cool because you could see all of the chefs in action on their Weber grills. That goes to show that they&#39;ve got nothing to hide and they&#39;re good at what they do! 

The server was informative, attentive, and warned me of something that I almost wish I listened to: beware of the pretzel rolls. They&#39;re irresistibly soft, chewy, and are so deliciously filling. They&#39;re even served with cheese butter. Cheese butter! Oh my goodness, I didn&#39;t even know such a thing existed. 

I ordered one of their specials - a truffle Parmesan NY strip steak. It came with two sides, and the carb lover in me opted for the macaroni and cheese (it&#39;s my go-to, everywhere I go) and mashed potatoes. My boyfriend got a barbecue combo of ribs and pulled pork. 

Holy macaroni! I regretted eating all of those pretzel rolls (but they were just so damn good), because that truffle steak was one of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever had. It was flavorful, perfectly cooked, and an all-over mouthgasm. But I could barely eat more than a few bites; those pretzel rolls destroyed me. I had to take everything to-go. Fortunately for me, the food was just as good the next day, if not better because I got to retaste the deliciousness all over again.

I have always kind of overlooked Weber Grill but it&#39;s stood the test of time in Schaumburg and I can now confidently recommend it to my coworkers!"

Started with a cup of chili. Chili was good but they put a full tablespoon dollop of sour cream on it. That might sound good but it&#39;s a cup of chili not a bowl. When I mixed it in it became chili flavored sour cream soup... Poor balance of SC to chili...

Had the Prime burger... I had high hopes for this but it was sub par. Somewhat over seasoned so I couldn&#39;t taste the beef and it came out med well at the least (ordered med). Should have ordered Med Rare. I&#39;ve had many better burgers especially for $16! The parm fries are good.

The other good thing was the pork ribs. Good smokey flavor without being too strong. Expensive for $19 (half) &amp; $30 (full) slab. I think these are really good and would come back for them.

Service was good at lunch."

It was very good.  The second time I went was last night and I had a combo platter.  Of course I had to order pulled pork because I&#39;m the eternal optomist and figure if this place is know for meat, that maybe, just maybe they have a good pulled pork.  They didn&#39;t.  Now those who know my reviews on sliced / pulled meats know that I eat them with a scapel. And 80% of the time they are subpar.  It&#39;s not that the meat isn&#39;t juicy or tender or flavorful, but all that gets cancelled out in my book if it&#39;s got chuncks of fat.  And this pulled pork did.  I enjoyed their ribs, and their meatload.  I didn&#39;t dare try the brisket because that&#39;s usually more fatty than pulled pork.  But in general, pulled pork aside, this restaurant is very nice.  The atmosphere, the servers (last night we had Erick), the prices, the food.  It&#39;s all really good.  So if you enjoy good meats and aren&#39;t a freak about fat on meat like I am.  Check this place out."

I ordered the black angus meatloaf and brisket combo. 
I was not at all disappointed. It was also a lot of food! The brisket was okay but the meatloaf was great! BBQ sauce is very good.
They have a selection of sides but I had whipped sweet potatoes with bourbon butter..and ..yum!! I also chose the creamy bleu cheese and pecan cole slaw and it was also very good. The plate comes with cornbread but they also give complimentary pretzel rolls which I tried with spreads and they were very good too!
The Tea comes with a flavor I was not enjoying and the serve gladly swapped it out for a coke.
The service was perfect from start to finish.
The only reason I didn&#39;t give 5 stars was the brisket could have been a little juicier. Even though it was tasty!!"

Had 2 whiskey sours with makers mark, drinks were strong and made well although they came in a strange wine glass looking glass - 4/5

My girlfriend and I split the wedge salad. It was made well but kind of small. Wedges are typically a third to a half of a lettuce head and with it split it looked to be about an 8th of a lettuce head. Either way it was great (dident fill us up too much either) 4/5

Prime rib-- delicious. Exactly what I would expect from a 30$ prime rib. Not much to say here other than it was excellent. The garlic mashed potatoes were great too, they add a lot of butter and possibly cream to them but they tasted great. 5/5

Finished with the seasonal white chocolate creme brulee. There are no words to describe how amazing this was. It was a small creme brulee dessert but it was the best I have ever had.

Our bill was 108$. Exactly what I would expect from the meal we had (girlfriend had parm crusted tilapia which was also fantastic). Had a great time tonight, we will be back. Check this place out if you are in the area!!"

We went for a lunch after a baby shower and had their BBQ ribs and chicken. It was served family style and 1 plate of ribs, chicken mashed potatoes and green beans were put out for each 5 people. It turns out that you only get a single serving of ribs ( which is 2 bones) per person.
I waited my turn, which meant that I got the serving plate last and the ribs were gone - when I asked the waitress for more, I was told that you only get 1 piece of ribs per person! Since I waited my turn, I got none!!!
The rest of the food was mediocre,  the BBQ chicken was very greasy, tough and fatty. The mashed potatoes were watery and the green beans were cold.
Since I attended with a group, I did not have to pay, but based on what I received, I felt bad for the people throwing the function - whatever they paid, they paid too much.

Think twice before you book a group there - I know most people in the group were very disappointed  - check out other places, there are much better venues out there that want your business,  this place does not!"

Considering both me and my date have celiac disease and I have other food allergies they handled the situation beautifully. The manager came over and explained how they handled the situation. First the waiter took our order on a big red card, this signifies allergy. Then the chef would sit down with the cook and confirm that all the ingredients being used are okay. Then the manager comes back out and confirms it all and says were good to go. Then our meal started being prepped. Now while this did add time to our night it was completely worth it. We felt safe and pretty much knew our meals would come out correctly.

They had a gluten free menu printed out which was nice. I decided to order the salmon grilled on a wood plank with steamed broccoli and grilled asparagus. This meal usually comes with green beans but I could not have those since they were tossed in butter. My date got the New York strip with garlic mashed potatoes. We were both very pleased with our meals and the service we received. The only downfall was when the busboy brought us out rolls and I asked &#34;are these gluten free?&#34; and he said &#34;yes.&#34; I saw confusion a little in his face though so we waited and decided not to risk it. Good thing the waitress pulled them away immediately and said the busboys are not informed. I would say that could be a way they could improve on their allergy procedures. Other than that though what a great experience."

I won&#39;t go into the pretzel rolls like so many do, but I&#39;ll highlight a few of my favorite items. The Mediterranean grilled vegetable salad is amazing, especially with some grilled chicken or salmon. Mixed greens, grilled asparagus, grilled artichokes, roasted peppers, tomatoes, shaved red onion, kalamata olives, feta cheese, pepperoncini, herbed pita croutons, and white balsamic vinaigrette. The smokey flavor from the grilled veggies take this to another level; this is no boring run of the mill salad. The BBQ brisket is really flavorful as well, though I wasn&#39;t as thrilled with the pulled pork. Also, the Founder&#39;s strip steak sandwich is a wonderful sandwich. It comes on ciabatta with a house-made bourbon steak sauce and I always get it with mushrooms and onions. I asked for the steak medium-rare and that&#39;s how it was served.  

And every year, I am here for Thankgiving. If you need a restaurant to go, I&#39;d recommend it. For $30, it&#39;s all you can eat. Pretzel rolls, soup or salad, a mix of dark and white turkey (which is not baked, but roasted on the grill!), sausage stuffing, mashed or sweet potatoes, a cranberry sauce that is actually edible, roasted brussels sprouts or asparagus, and dessert. I&#39;ve been to a couple of restaurants for Thanksgiving and this is my favorite."

Rolls - soft and chewy and excellent with the dark yellow butter (cheddar?)

Sides: String Beans were crisp and garlic mashed had a nice flavor

Sorry but apologies from management after the fact are too little too late.

Pros: location, availability to serve larger groups, variety of barbecue options.

Cons: cons colon ordering family style and being told that you&#39;re not allowed to eat what you want. The server called people out when she felt the they had more than one portion on their play. The server also actually removed food off of someone&#39;s used plates and gave it to someone else in our group. That is absolutely disgusting and I will be filing a complaint with the health department.

So now as a result the management has given us a discount and sent us gift cards. All the money in the world even a full refund it&#39;s just not enough it&#39;s absolutely disgusting that you take food off of someone else&#39;s plate and thoroughly embarrassing when you call people out when they have two of a particular item. Their service was horrendous.

On top of that the food came out one item at a time. So you would get green beans and they would sit there for 10 minutes and see you then got mashed potatoes which would then subsequently sit there for 10 minutes until you got the chicken which then subsequently sat there or whatever number of minutes before the next item came out. Appetizers which consisted of two flatbreads took 45 minutes. Not quite sure where why it took that long the majority of the restaurant was empty."

My strawberry lemonade was a huge let down. Super watered down- I prefer the Minute Maid lemonade I get at work.

I got the Teriyaki Skirt Steak and requested garlic parmesan fries but got mashed potatoes instead. The server apologized and brought me the garlic parmesan fries. 

The Teriyaki Skirt Steak was amazing! It was full of flavor and super juicy. YUM!

I actually ended up liking the mashed potatoes a lot more than the garlic parmesan fries so I had to hide the fries on other people&#39;s plates to make it look like I ate some! The mashed potatoes were pretty buttery and good. =)

The garlic parmesan fries were skinny and had no seasoning except for pieces of raw parmesan shreds sprinkled on them. My husband&#39;s fries that came with his burger were much more flavorful.

My husband enjoyed his farm burger as well.

Our server was super nice and funny. We were celebrating a birthday and he asked for a slice of cake which is kind of unprofessional but he was a funny guy so we gave it to him and he loved the cake!

The pretzel rolls with cheddar spread were amazing! But when we asked for more, our server completely forgot us. That&#39;s fine, it happens, even though it was a slower night. 
But then we got our steaks. My mother ordered medium and my father and I both ordered medium rare. My mother&#39;s arrived medium, my father&#39;s arrived on the more well done end of medium rare, and mine came medium, edging into medium well. I really don&#39;t like steak cooked more than medium rare, so my dad was nice enough to switch with me and send the overdone one back. 20 minutes later, the replacement arrived pretty much raw in the middle. At this point my mom and I were done eating so we decided just to leave. For a grill-focused restaurant, the steak just wasn&#39;t good. Added to that, the service was slow and unfriendly. I&#39;ll be looking for other steakhouse recommendations.

My coworkers back in NH have been to this location during a business trip and loved it! I spent most of the day and evening driving several hundred miles and I needed food late at night! The Weber Grill was open!

I arrived here around 10:15 PM and I was promptly seated in a comfortable booth. On the way to the booth, I walked by the open kitchen which had plenty of big Weber grills. After being seated, the waiter stopped by to bring to take my drink order. I ordered a Diet Coke ($2.75) with free refills. A basket of fresh baked rolls with butter were brought out, which were soft and chewy. 

For dinner, I ordered the BBQ Combo (Choose 2 Meats $18.50) with Black Angus Meatloaf and Pulled Pork for the meats, 2 side choices: Mac &amp; Cheese &amp; Cole Slaw, and Corn Bread. The portions of food looked generous. The chargrilled meatloaf was soft inside and coated with a hickory BBQ sauce. The pulled pork was soft and juicy. The mac &amp; cheese was very soft and mushy (macaroni), plenty of cheese in the mix. The shredded cole slaw (cabbage,red cabbage, carrots) in a light mayo had a crunchy texture, which was a cool and refreshing side. The corn bread was very soft with niblet corn inside, not too sweet. I finished my entire dinner pretty fast since I was hungry. I decided to pass on the offer for dessert since it was getting very late.

Overall, the food I had was very good. The service here was prompt. The food came out to my table quickly in under 10 minutes after ordering. I was also given refills on the Diet Coke when requested. I would definitely have dinner again at The Weber Grill if I happen to be staying in Chicagoland again."

My wife and I have tried basically every upscale restaurant in the area, and Weber represents the best value time after time.

Atmosphere is similar to an upscale home.  Hardwood booths with leather seats, The lobby has a statue of I&#39;m guessing the patriarch of the Weber-Stephens family, as well as a mural showing some history of the company.  The smell of a backyard bbq wafts in as you approach the door.  Once inside kitchen&#39;s commercial Weber grills are in plain view from the lobby.  I am a fan of restaurants with kitchens that are open.        

Servers and hosts have always been friendly and professional, though the time we were there on a week night, it did seem our server was too busy for us.  I&#39;ll give the benefit of a doubt, It was a busy night.  

Bar is a typical upscale restaurant bar with a few TV&#39;s, nothing too fancy but definitely a comfortable place to grab a drink.  Bartender was knowledgeable and friendly the time I sat up there while we waited for a table.  

Food is the reason I keep coming back.  I&#39;ve tried the New York Strip and Prime Rib.  Both were on point.  Simple seasoning, the meat is the star of the show.  Always seared and cooked to the right temperature.  I could easily spoil my meal by eating too many pretzel rolls, especially with the cheese spread.  Desserts have been outstanding each time I&#39;ve had them, though the selection seems to be limited to very rich or hot desserts, I&#39;d love to see lighter sweets or ice cream dishes on the menu."

Service was good--the noise level was annoying due to a table of women trying to outscream each other.  Guess there was nothing that could be done about that.  Hoped the beverages they were served would calm them, but no such luck.  I digress.  The crab cake appetizer was surprisingly good-- I had no high expectation, but was pleasantly proven wrong.  Had the sausage and rib bbq combo with slaw and mac n cheese.  All was very good and delivered hot."

That&#39;s at best. Worst case? Weber Grill really has gone downhill. Last night, I was so looking forward to a great steak dinner with all the fixings as my birthday treat.
As RARELY eat red meat, this is my birthday meal of choice. And I really look forward to it. My sister siggested Weber Grill by her house. I hadn&#39;t been here in years but immediately became reminiscent of great steak and savory barbecue. Yes! I agreed.
It was Friday night at Schaumburg location so the joint was very busy. 
We started with onion strings and the artichoke &amp; spinach dip. My dining mates didn&#39;t like the lack of flavor of the strings and the diced tomatoes added ( but not usual) to the dip. I thought they were ok. 
I ordered the wedge salad with blue cheese dressing. 
Here&#39;s where it all went wrong. The &#34;wedge&#34; was not 
the usual quarter wedge of iceberg lettuce. It was a bulb of romaine laying in its side!!!!! Romaine!!! Who does that??? A top this passive looking lettuce....was cherry tomatoes, grilled onions and bacon. Because it was romaine in one whole chunk with all this junk on top it was hard to eat/cut. The romaine wasn&#39;t crisp and fresh....more flavorless and limp. Strike #1
I ordered the filet medium PLUS with a blue cheese CRUST. Please note. With a side of sauteed spinach w/garlic. What arrived, was a filet cooked MEDIUM RARE (NOT medium plus) with blue cheese crumbles on top. I asked for a crust which denotes grilling the cheese on the streak. They got my once-a- year streak WRONG. There&#39;s nothing worse than a re cooked steak nor waiting for a new streak when your party is eating their meals. So I ate it. The streak was tender, the mashed potatoes good. The spinach was undercooked and flavorless. Strike #2
The red sangria was more fruit than wine. When we first arrived at the table, there was a birthday card for me at the table. We all expected some promo gift as a token. Maybe a free app or drink. It was just a card. Cheesy. At the end of the meal, the waiter brought over the teenist, tiniest itsy- bitsy chocolate cake with a melon ball serving of ice cream. No extra forks for sharing like most places but i guess since it was so small, they really couldnt. No birthday singing. Kind of put a damper on our celebration. Strike #3
Again, either they were too busy and things weren&#39;t as good as they could be or.....they&#39; ve really slipped in their standards.
Next year, I&#39;ll stick with Capital Grille or Gale St. Inn."

My fiancé and I had the colossal shrimp for an appetizer and they were great, only two so for the price I would have liked 3-4, but still worth it. The prime Webber burger was perfection. It tastes like that perfect burger you&#39;re always trying to grill at home but always come short of. The onions were tasty and the fries, they were small slightly crunchy and full of flavor."

My honest opinion of the BBQ ribs and chicken was it was dry but I had a mushroom burger that was great and the filet mignon with garlic mash potatoes which was excellent. It&#39;s a nice place to check out if you&#39;re in the area. A little pricey but the portion size is good. Lunch during a regular work week is busy so keep that in mind if you go at that time.

The GM sat us, and was very friendly.
Now, service. Matt was our server, and he was very knowledgeable and very friendly!! We are not from the area, so we didn&#39;t know what was special there. Matt was super patient, and knew how to suggest and make us feel welcome. 
The pretzel rolls were delicious. I ordered a caesar salad and it was fantastic. Both my date and I ordered the filet. They came out PERFECTLY! He ordered the shrimp and turf, and the shrimp was delicious. I ordered a side of asparagus, and it was also delicious. 
We were both too full for dessert, but the dessert menu looked amazing!! Will most definitely be back the next time we&#39;re in Schaumberg!"

Everything on the extensive menu is made right there on one of their grills.  Truly a carnivore&#39;s dream!

Plenty of beef, but lots of other tasty things on the menu as well... something for everyone. And don&#39;t miss the Chili of the Day... usually something very tasty and unique.  Today&#39;s  was Cincinnati Chili... Very authentic and reminiscent of Skyline Chili in that city, but without the spaghetti. 

Weber&#39;s... Highly recommended with 3 locations in Chicagoland."

My office has hosted multiples lunches here and we go for dinner from time to time. My first issue is the noise. There is no good way to carry on a conversation here. It&#39;s annoying. Between the open kitchen (which I do love to see!) and all the noise that comes from that added to the strange acoustics, I really don&#39;t do too much talking when dining here. Kinda takes the fun out of dining with other people. 

The service is always attentive and I cannot recall a time being annoyed by an empty glass or piles of dirty dishes. These are big pluses in my book!  The pretzel rolls are quite good when served warm. A cold roll sneaks in from time to time, so watch out for those stinkers. 

Most recently, we visited with my dad and stepmom. Dad loved his meal - a burger. He likes straightforward, no fuss food. Done!  My stepmom seemed to like her meal too, but her steak was waaaay overdone. Enough that we could see it across the table on the first cut. She never said a word, but that&#39;s a sure fire way to ensure a guest won&#39;t come back. Please don&#39;t overcook the steak at Weber Grill....  The hubby and I shared a platter. I think we want for three meats. Their meatloaf is as good as my mama&#39;s!  Shhhh, don&#39;t tell her. The beef brisket was nice and juicy and the pulled pork had a great flavor. 

Desserts here have not been memorable. I know a cupcake was involved during our most recent visit, but it was so boring that I didn&#39;t take a picture or make any notes to remember it. 

Overall, it&#39;s a fine choice, but it&#39;s not always consistent and that doesn&#39;t make me rush back."

We sat in the Grill room and had Sara as our server. We ordered bloody Marys and the honey mustard chicken skewer appetizer. The bloody Marys come with a skewer of sausage, pickle, olive, and gouda cheese, mmmmm! ALSO A SIDE OF BEER, OKAY?! It was delicious, spicy as hell, and had great vodka in it! The beer was their backyard brew and it was delicious! The beer went down smooth and had a nice, malty finish. 

The honey mustard chicken came out served on a bed of fried onion strings, which was not stated on the menu, and we both hate onions, but they took it back and brought us a new plate right away. The chicken catme out hot, tender, and coated in delicious honey dijon sauce with some honey mustard dipping sauce on the side. So good! It could definitely be served as an entree! 

The brunch specials looked amazing this morning, but we tried something from the BBQ menu. I had the BBQ combo with chicken and pork, sides of mac and cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese was delicious and had a thick and creamy sauce. I loved that it was made with cavatappi noodles! I find those noodles to hold sauce better than the traditional macaroni noodles. I did not like the baked beans at all, but again, Sara replaced them with a side of broccoli, which was cooked perfectly! The pork was really tender and salty, full of flavor. The sauce served with it was phenomenal. The chicken had a nice and crispy skin with the sauce on it. Very tender! My boyfriend had the brisket and it was amazing! So lean, very little fat, but so tender, it just melted in your mouth! He had the macaroni and mashed potatoes as his sides. I LOVED THE POTATOES SO MUCH! Garlicky, red-skinned potato goodness! 

Overall, this was an amazing meal and an amazing experience. The service was phenomenal, and everything came out hot and delicious. I loved everything about this experience. Thank you, Weber Grill, for an excellent Easter brunch!"

The meat for the steak kabobs did not taste the freshest.  The ribs were okay, a little dry. The chicken was good, probably the best of all.  The kids meals cheeseburgers was very good.   An another compliment on an adult burger.   The beets with goat cheese and pecans whew good.  Apple pie and creme brûlée were fair.  Had not been here in a couple of years.

This place is reliable for a great dinner.  The wood cooking is evident, the friendly servers recognizing patrons is comforting for travelers.

The last time we had been to this particular restaurant was approximately six months earlier. I have to say that we were surprised by the in adequate service and was underwhelmed by the Quality of the food. It&#39;s hard to believe that the restaurant changed that significantly in the past six months.

The quality of the service was poor. Our server was missing most of the evening. When he did show up he was all about the apology for not being able to provide service.

With regard to the food, the garlic mashed potatoes lacked garlic flavor and The blue cheese coleslaw didn&#39;t seem to contain any blue cheese.

I have to say that the manager was attentive to our complaints and was gracious enough to deduct $25 from our bill.

We will go back again in the future and our hope is that the restaurant will provide us with a better experience at that time."

I had the burger on the specials menu, which was delicious, full of flavor. It came medium as asked. I had the coleslaw which was a bit sweet to my taste - I like my coleslaw sharp and tangy, but instead it had stuff like cranberries in. 

Someone in the party had a salad which was a very good portion and looked fantastic. Another had the &#34;salmon salad&#34; and that looked rather disappointing - a separate piece of salmon with a side salad of sorts.

Ordered a side salad, made fresh to order. Some might think that&#39;s a no brainier, however if you&#39;ve ever ordered a salad and it came with a cold or chilled dish. It was made earlier in the day.

Was on the fence between the prime rib and 16oz New York. Went with the 16oz and it didn&#39;t disappoint. Cooked perfectly in font of me and some friends. Garlic mashed potatoes were a great addition.

I&#39;ve wanted to visit this place ever since I heard they were opening. Although I&#39;m not about going to those corporate owned restaurants this was a must stop. Although the weber grills are only in and around Chicago. If you have the opportunity you need to go. Well worth the wait, if you have to.

My first experience was a great one - great atmosphere, the service was decently fast for a Friday evening.  My girlfriends and I were able to have some drinks and dinner with no major difficulties with service or food errors. Weber Grill&#39;s burgers are high quality and I love the seasoning that they put on them.  The waiter was very accommodating when I requested no bun. 

My last experience was not so great.  My boyfriend and I had made reservations for one of our anniversaries.  We called to ask if we could move our reservation time up at all because we were ready early (surprisingly!).  They informed us that the restaurant was closed that evening due to unexpected circumstances.  However - they never informed us.  So at 7 PM, we are stranded without reservations in the suburbs near Woodfield Mall... We ended up waiting for a reservation at another location at 8:30 PM!  We were both very unhappy and the person on the phone who informed us never even apologized.  Talk about bad customer service. 

Go to another location or hope that their customer service has increased since then."

The first time I came here with my brother I was disappointed in how pepper-y the BLT sandwich was.  Having had it several times before I know how it should be, but the bacon was so coated in pepper I couldn&#39;t eat it.  However this must have been an anomaly because it&#39;s been great any other time.

They have pretzel rolls and a cheddar butter (as well as regular) which was a nice change from the usual bread.

Their website mentions a dress code and I was nervous the second time I went and my boyfriend was in jeans, but the family in front of us showed up in little league gear including a dad in gym shorts and there was no problem.  It was lunch time on a Sunday so not sure if dinner is more strict but we were fine.

The second non-work visit we sat in the bar area.  The service was great.  There&#39;s a special bar eats menu, so rather than getting the pulled pork sandwich for 9.50, I decided to get the chips with their french onion dip and pulled pork pretzel bowls also off the bar menu.  These together came to 50 cents less than the pulled pork meal.  I probably got less meat, but I got more chips and dip.  I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the dip, but the chips were great as usual.  Normally I&#39;m a french fry person but here I recommend the chips.  The pulled pork pretzel bowls were good, it was basically their pretzel rolls cut in half, grilled briefly, with pulled pork and coleslaw on top.  If you&#39;re really hungry you&#39;re better off getting the sandwich instead but for me this was the perfect amount.  I would definitely go back for the pulled pork."

Both were incredible. The brisket was tender and moist. The sauce was a little sweet for my liking since I prefer my brisket dry but it was still very very tasty and cooked perfectly. The ribs were incredible. They fell off the bone with a little tug meaning they were NOT over cooked. The rub was caramelized to perfection. Sauce was a little sweet but lightly brushed on and complimented the ribs perfectly. Would highly recommend. 

Let&#39;s talk sides. I had the bourbon baked beans, Mac and cheese and a square of corn bread. The beans were real good. Again a little sweet, but not too sweet. The beans had big chunks of brisket I&#39;m them and had my favorite bean, the kidney bean. Never had baked beans with a kidney bean before but man it was good. Mac and cheese was delicious. Hands down the best I&#39;ve ever had and I&#39;ve had lot of Mac and cheese and bbq joints in my day. Make sure to make this a side when you visit the weber grill. 

Pretzel bread and garlic butter. One word wow. 

The ambiance was great. The old grills were cool. The kitchen is part of the dinning area. Huge charcoal grills cook the food. The heat lamps are made out of weber kettle lids. 

The place is amazing! We ate in smokey joes bar and the bar area is huge. Service was great and our server was the best. I would highly recommend the weber grill. We traveled from Cali and this was our first establishment to eat at. Don&#39;t miss it if your from out of town. If you live in this area consider your self lucky to have such a bad ass place to eat! 

We liked it so much we will be eating here when we head back to catch our and later this week. Weber grill two thumbs up!!!"

Ordered medium rare and cam medium to well. The replacement steak came 20 min later almost raw. Service was slow. At least they took the steak off the bill ( it was not eaten ). My beer came 1/2 empty as the keg was out. What else could go wrong?  Shame as the vibe was nice. Obviously do not recommend at all.

You can smell the grills pulling into the parking lot. I love a good cookout in the summer! 

We were seated in a matter of a few minutes to arriving. The girl at the front must have been new because she was a little clueless. I&#39;ll let it slide. 

We got our pretzel bread and our cheese butter...yes cheese BUTTER...thats just ridiculous. But it was delicious needless to say. 

Our server was very attentive and knew everything on the menu. I wasn&#39;t sure what to get since I had never been there and my date suggested steak. I did&#39;t want to be an expensive first date, haha so I got the Wisconsin Burger (Go Pack!) and it was absolutely delicious and moderately priced! Cooked medium just perfectly and the taste was better than any other chain restaurant. For my side I got the coleslaw, another great item. Its hard to find a restaurant with a good slaw. There was a lot of food so I ended up taking half of it home.

I would love to come back again and try a steak. The fillet was calling my name but I didn&#39;t want to order a $30+ meal on a first date. :)"

Ambiance:   3 stars - Nice and open and I kind of like the fact that you walk by the grilling / prep area.   But, at the same time nothing to write home about either.   

Staff:   4 stars - The waitress we had was really good.  On top of the game and checked back to the table often, to ensure things were going along well.    

Menu:  2 stars - I personally found the menu a bit limited.   I few different cuts of steaks (but no T-Bone! ) very little chicken and pork.    I would have like to have seen around twice as much as what they offered.   

Food: 2 stars - I got the steak and my wife got pork.   Not to brag or anything, but I can do far better with my webber grill and pay a fraction of the price.   Not to mention, have fresh soda and not flat.    I found the coleslaw, bland and the garlic mashed potatoes also bland and a bit runny.   What I did like were the pretzel roles and the cheese spread!    But, certainly not enough to off balance the end price!"

Brought out of state company for dinner Labor Day evening.   Three of us ordered Prime Rib  medium rare.  Another ordered lamb chops.  We also ordered side salads.   Server came back and said there was no med rare prime rib available.  This is at 6:30 in the evening.   I chose the steak and frites instead.   First my med rare steak came well done.  They remade, my replacement was med to well. The two prime rib dinners were cold, dry and looked like old food and had no flavor to them.  The server made it seem like the food is cooked somewhere else, brought in and re-heated when we were surprised  that no med rare meat was available.  She said they didn&#39;t get an order in for that day being a Holiday.  Will never go back.  Other complaint was there was barely a drop of salad dressing on our salads and we all had to request some more dressing."

I ordered one of the specials - Bourbon mahi mahi with mashed sweet potatoes. Mahi does not have a lot of flavor and requires seasoning. I detected zero flavor whatsoever in the fish. Where was the Bourbon flavor? The sweet potatoes had the consistency of baby food and were way too sweet, cloyingly sweet, as if they added sugar. I dunno, perhaps getting some form of beef with a baked potato is a better option at this restaurant.

Also, I get that it&#39;s called the &#34;Weber Grill&#34; and sells itself on charcoal flavor, but the smoke hung in the air throughout the restaurant. Do you really want to walk out of a restaurant reeking of a charcoal grill? I don&#39;t."

______________________

I had not heard of Priya until I was looking at south indian caterers for an event. So we decided to check it out as a test and headed there exactly when it reopens for dinner at 5:30. 

We ordered the following:
-The special thali - we picked lamb biryani (meh), and chicken curry (pretty darn good). it came with rasam and sambar (both sub par), which doesn&#39;t seem like a proper pairing for biryani. It also came with yogurt rice, the pakoda (cold), orka masala (not good), and dal (good but kinda redundant with the dal based sambar which doesn&#39;t fit). The dessert looked messy but it was tasty. 
- Paneer tikka masala - pretty tasty but creamy north indian dish
- Gutti Vankay - great recommendation from the boss. I liked everything about this.
- garlic naan - good and can&#39;t go wrong. 

The stand out dishes were the chicken curry, and the gutti vankay. The paneer dish was fine too. Despite some misses I still would go back to try other south indian favorites. I really wanted to try the lamb fry or curries but maybe next time. 

Rant: Service-wise, I find it annoying when the owner/boss can&#39;t have a conversation with you and eager to provide recommendations (he seemed rather robotic and just down to business initially). it a took a while to convey that I was asking for what is popular in their restaurant which he finally told me the eggplant dishes. Additionally, I would have liked to really ask what they have on hand that they can make fresh and well but it may be taken the wrong way...or cause extra confusion."

Have tried their buffet, a la carte and also been here twice on Tuesday and once on Thursday for dinner. They have Dosa nights on these two days. 

Their dosas are perfect. Thin, crispy, covered with ghee, soft- name it, you get it! 
Their buffets are pretty decent too. With both veg and non veg options.
On the dosa nights you order your choice of dosa (about 15-20 types of dosa) when seated on your table and the rest is to be self served from the buffet, including varieties of chutneys, sambhar, rasam etc

I personally had a bad experience last time I went.. Firstly being some occasion it was too crowded and staff were having a hard time running around. He dosas ordered came very late and also there was some mess up between or order and others
Sambhar wasn&#39;t up to the mark this time and rasam was thick!

We got our appetizer one at a time and about 10 mins apart.

We&#39;re now about 90 mins in and still haven&#39;t received 3 of our other dishes!  We ended up cancelling and just paid for what we did get and left.

The food that we did end up getting was tasty, so o won&#39;t mark them down on that, but when service isn&#39;t your priority, and not getting food when you expect it, my appetite for anything was just gone.

There are at least 12 dosa styles and  the usual chutney&#39;s -coconut, tomato and peanut along with sambar.  they just keep on coming until you are full. Dosa&#39;s are made to order  and things such as idli and tomato/potato curry are also included.
For those that are not familiar with the Dosa and Idlis here is the rundown. Dosa&#39;s are a kind of crepe made with rice and lentil flour. Some are paper thin, others are very thick. Sometimes things are added like cheese, egg or extra seasoning.  Idli is a kind of steamed rice cake. Both are meant to eaten in conjunction with a semi liquid  such as sambar or chutney. Sambar is a thick vegetarian soup. Chutneys are a kind of condiment or dip.  All of these items are made in house at Priya, and the Dosa&#39;s are made to order.
Outside the Dosa buffet, the gobi manchurian is a standout dish. The veg dishes seem to be better then the meat ones although fish and chicken are also on the menu. I&#39;m especially fond of the indo chinese options.
Not so busy on weeknights, but the Dosa buffet can be packed. The parking lot is shared with the village tavern which is also super popular at dinner, but Priya is located on the opposite side from them and thus always has parking available."

We were like &#34;we have had this dish before at many other places and we know surely it is not like drinking pure lemon juice.&#34; They apparently redid and brought it back but it didn&#39;t taste good.

We started the buffet before 12:00, we were able to beat the crowd on a sunday. 
I started the buffet with pakoras and some vegies, good varieties of south indian chutneys. There was no naan, but they had chapati&#39;s another variety of bread.
The second course of the buffet was rice varieties, they had excellent Biryani and pulav and there were good entrees for the rice items. 
I did not taste the desert, but kids loved it. 
Finally the tea was authentic., but remember to add sugar before going back to the table.
Service was ok., they were unable to remove the buffet plates right away, it was a big deal for us ad we were dining with two small kids. So four stars 
Ambience was ok, But the pictures that are hung were good.
Finally the checkout was using, ipad dongle. It was kind of first time I saw in an Indian food place.

Plus it&#39;s great to have a buffet that serves up real good lamb and goat dishes too!The other great thing is that the customers that dine here are practically all (if not 99.9%) Indian--so you know Priya is keeping it real and not dumbing down the ingredients for anyone!

We decided to try Priya despite mixed reviews, and we&#39;re very glad we did.  The restaurant is a decent size with lighting that can only be described as romantic, and there was just one other table dining while we were there (a Monday night around 7).

The food: We ordered butter chicken, paneer tikka masala, and chapati. The paneer was delicious, so creamy and full of scrumptious onions. The chicken tasted very fresh, though I think we&#39;ll order it spicy next time (our fault for ordering &#34;mild&#34; since we were sharing with our two year old). The only thing I can find to criticize is that they ran out of coke and tried to serve me diet without letting me know of the shortage. 

The facility: The bathroom was pretty decent, especially compared to other similar restaurants (sorry, but you know it&#39;s true).  The manager came out at the end of our meal and seemed enamored with our son - so much so, that he invited the three of us back for a tour of the kitchen!  Wow!  Everyone there was friendly, and I have only limited commercial kitchen experience, but it all looked okay to me.  He showed us the separate cooking areas for vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, which I know is important to some people.

I saw one other reviewer mentioned getting sick after dining here, so I&#39;m just going to go ahead and address that.  I&#39;m just rounding out my first trimester of pregnancy and have not had exciting food in about three months, so I think if anyone were going to be made ill by this cuisine, it would likely be me.  All good!  I&#39;m very pleased."

The start was horrid since we were a group of 10 and made to wait nearly 30 mins for table. Totally understand since the crowd was big but there were not ample chairs at the waiting area. The restaurant is small for the crowd that visits on weekends.
The cashier lady is very rude. Its natural for customers to inquire about availability and she was so rude to us. To top it all she announces that a group that had made a phone reservation would be given preference over our group. I was losing patience when another staff came in and handled the situation and we were given split tables. I wud  give a 1 star for this behaviour.

Now the food in the buffet sort of dowsed the tensed atmosphere. Most of the dishes were very good. 
Plus: The pakoras were yum, Dosa and Idly was serveed hot and also quickly, the Egg curry was good. Desserts were nice and not very sugary. Sambhar had a lot of veggies.

Cons: Except the regular chutney all others were horrible, THe Rotis were hard and chewy, The biryani was over and no one bothered to refill it. And Rasam was garlicky.

Overall I will be fair and give a 3 star. If they improve customer service the star cud be better. im sure they have a lot of potential to becoming a fine-dine restaurant which they sadly arent today."

It is Indian cuisine tilted towards South India, especially Andhra Pradesh. One of the best things about Priya is their range of Chutneys. This is the closest you can get to authentic Ginger, Peanut, Tomato, Coconut and Mint chutneys anywhere in North America. The Dosa buffet brought me in for the first time two years back and they have a very wide variety of Dosas (Pesarattu - A Dosa made using green lentils; included).

The other items in the Dosa buffet are pretty average causing me to knock one star off. Their regular buffet on Sunday is typical pan Indian cuisine with Dosas included. I definitely recommend this place only for the Dosa Buffet and the Sunday Buffet + A La Carte is worth a shot.

The ambiance is more from the 1980s to 1990s interior, so don&#39;t expect much. Parking is not problem due to the strip mall location. Prices for the buffet vary between $13 to $15 which seems nominal. The service (when not done by the owner) can be a little more brisk."

Ever since Taj Mahal in Bloomingdale closed, my boyfriend and I have been on the hunt for a new favorite Indian restaurant to frequent. We were pretty excited to give Priya a try, given that it is just a short distance from home. 

Words hardly suffice to describe our disappointment and disgust. We ordered the Butter Chicken, one of our favorite dishes. On top of the entrees being incredibly overpriced, the food was just downright awful!! They call the meat they put in there chicken? Perhaps they gave us the cuts that were intended for their pets at home. Nothing but fatty, bony, chewy pieces that my boyfriend couldn&#39;t even get through without spitting it into a napkin! Not sure if plastic is a new addition to southern Indian cuisine, but I certainly don&#39;t prefer finding it in my food.. gross.

Long story short: We will absolutely never eat at Priya again. For what they charge, you would think they would take a LITTLE more pride in what they serve the general public.  Tsk tsk."

I have tried all places for south indian food esp. dosa and vada but havent found this taste. Even from this restaurant, I ordered food online but they serve only coconut chutney for online orders, which I am not a big fan of.

Being a foodie from India and actually having tasted every possible South Indian dish,in the entire south india,i crave sometimes for authentic or near authentic South Indian food
My brother is a bigger fan of the food as well!
So here we were braving the Chicago rain just to satisfy our cravings.

Not disappointed at all!!
The spread is different for Mondays,Tuesdays an Thursdays,we went on a Monday,and ill just say,its the closest you can get to South Indian food and the other one is UDIPi at Devon.
These two are anyday better than Mysore woodland.
I am a big fan of sambar,and i found both here ant UDIPi to have great sambar!

Austin( the guy who helped us) was great and helpful to have around.special mention about him as well.

For others,who have complaints-i sometimes wonder why people can be so dumb/ignorant.

You have come to a South Indian restaurant,why in the world would you order something from them which is not their specialty and then complain?

Had to ASK for chips (normally that is brought out with water and menus), while trying to order... finally decided on &#39;safe&#39; chicken biryani and friend got lamb version.

My partner enjoyed his Kadai Chicken.  The masla dosa came with a lot of food for the money, but the potato curry was extremely spicy for being a mild order.

We only received one container of rice though we ordered 2 entrees; it wasn&#39;t nearly enough.

Ordered Gulab Jamun ($5) and was disappointed to find that it was only two pieces in a syrup that lacked the complex spiced flavor I was used to. Tasted like a sugar syrup with some honey.

They actually forgot to include the dosa when my partner picked up the order. They called us as he returned home, and he had to drive back to pick it up. They were very apologetic about it though.

Mutter Paneer: Pretty good, not as tomato-based as usual and light on the peas, very salty.

Whether you order south indian or Punjabi they will always serve you some papad with a nice spicy chutney, this is a nice twist to starting your meal.

My friend made a reservation here for 40 people for their rehearsal dinner. If you&#39;ve been by, you can see that that&#39;s pretty much their whole restaurant. Now, if you&#39;ve got a large (well, huge) group coming in, you&#39;d think you would want to make sure the tables were ready right? No. Not a single table was ready for our group. In fact, we had to trickle in as people finished their dinners. That ... was terribly awkward.

Maybe the food would redeem it?

No. No, it would not. The dosa buffet is setup so you gather whatever you&#39;d like to eat your dosa (uh .. a savory crepe?) with and wait at your table to order whatever kinds of dosa you&#39;d like. The main problem I had was that they selection of fillings was terrible: barely any vegetables, no protein, and bland dessert. But lots of chutneys. So, there&#39;s that.

The folks that come around and ask for the dosa orders were kind and seemed embarrassed at their lack of preparation, but weren&#39;t that helpful. There&#39;s 30-40 different kinds of dosa but no description to help you choose between them. By the time we actually got ours, we were too hungry to be picky.

Largest selection of dosas anywhere.  They have entire nights and lunches dedicated to unlimited dosa buffets.
Someone once told me that the secret to excellent indian food is when it has been slow cooked for days. Probably why Indian food from most places is often better as leftovers- lets the flavors meld. Priya has that days long, slow cooked taste to it with the first bite.  I wanted to say it has that &#39;leftovers&#39; taste to it, but doesnt sound as appealing, even if i mean it in a good way.
The papadam chips they bring out were very good. thin and crispy.  Served with an excellent chutney.
We started with the vegetable pakoda app.  the only item we weren&#39;t really impressed with.  way too much batter around a single sliver of vegetable.  Excellent chutneys, though. 
Then we ordered a dosa.  i think we picked one with potato &amp; onion.  The kids tore the dosa apart.  Served with excellent, and widely diverse selection of chutneys.
Then we ordered the mutter paneer- mild, mostly for the kids.  I would certainly order medium spicy or even hotter next time. but was nice and creamy as mild.
We also ordered the chicken fry.  It appeared to be mostly dark meat chicken- bone in.  most excellent.  Lots of ginger flavor- big hunks of it right on top.  Would definitely order again.
Very large menu.  I can&#39;t wait to go back and try something new."

Wanted to eat here since a very long time ago when I heard that this restaurant serves Andhra food. Got the urge to eat here after an exhausting morning at Ikea and me n the hubby quickly drove up here. I&#39;m turned off by buffets but it actually sounds good when you&#39;re starving! The lunch buffet costs $14/person during the weekends and its totally worth it. Don&#39;t expect a very inviting ambiance or super attentive friendly service, come here with the sole motive to get some good food. The dishes are mostly south Indian. Crispy hot dosas are brought to the table that taste divine with the mint chutney. The vadas are cooked perfectly and very flavorful. The sambar and rasam took me back to the days when I would ditch dinner at home and sneakily eat at my neighbor&#39;s place. They do have chapathis and a couple of sides but as I said earlier the south Indian food is the primary focus and it is very good.

Brother made reservations - which at the time I thought was pointless since I&#39;ve never seen a packed indian restaurant before. 

Turned out to be great since huge line and packed house at priya. The waiter/host was friendly and had good sense of humor. He was also really nice and efficient on the phone. 

We got to sit right away at reserved table = nice  

While seated - didnt get a waiter to come to table for 20mins. Didnt get apps til like 40-60mins. We were there 1.5hrs and our main food didnt come yet. 

They were severly understaffed, unorganized and just seemed like amateur hour -maybe first time ever they&#39;ve been this packed?

Asked the guy how long they&#39;ve been in business (thought they must&#39;ve been new) - nope, been around for 10yrs!!

Plus it felt like 100+ degrees and super humid inside. Zero ventilation + packed house + hot kitchen = sweating nonstop. 

The annoying light hindi music (too low to hear, but loud enough to sound like a buzzibg bee) made it even worse.

Very authentic south indian food. The variety of dishes they serve is awesome and elaborate. The biryani, rasam are always good. The rasam is as spicy and hot as it should be. The chicken starters are always without an exception tasty and yummy and never fail to hit the right spot. Even the veg starters are well made and tasty. My husband loves the pongal and the veg dishes they serve here. Even the desserts are tasty. 

Recently, we had been to Dakshin which was not great at all and definitely not worth the price that we paid there. Any given day, I would prefer Priya over any other buffet. The ambiance is okay, but go for the awesome food. Though the buffet seems a bit expensive, but they serve much much better food here than I have tried at other places. Of all the buffets, this is worth every penny.

(The only irritating and unbearable thing are the songs of the 90&#39;s which they play. Ow, no complaints)"

They were doing a special on Dosa which is like a lite and thin pancake, almost like pita or lavosh flatbread.  So we all ordered the endless Dosa.  And they kept coming out with different flavored Dosa and they were all delicious.  Some of them were very spicy, baked into the bread.  Turns out there was a buffet setup, but it was all for chutney.  So you take your plate to the buffet and dish up some spoonfuls of your favorite chutney, then come back to your table and spread the amount you want on the Dosa.  We laughed over several Kingfisher beers and had a great time.

It is a small place that you probably wouldn&#39;t think twice about if you saw it from Wise Road.  But it is definitely worth a visit for authentic Indian food from the southern central part of the country."

My parents and I came in after an afternoon of shopping at Deepkala.  And wow.  We went in and it was packed with Indians speaking all kinds of southern languages--Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam.  The buffet line is nothing like I&#39;ve ever seen before.  It was divided into a non-veg and veg side, and the traditional southern dishes that we eat at home in the buffet line shocked me!  There were various pickles, yogurt rice, rasam, sambaar, tamarind rice, etc. among the regulars like curry chicken, biriyani, etc.  I have NEVER seen yogurt rice in a buffet line.  ever.  And fresh dosas were brought to the table, which were delicious with the sambaar.  Buffet was a bit expensive, but worth it for this experience.

I grew up eating South Indian food at my best friend&#39;s house, so I&#39;m familiar with South Indian home cooking and Priya does not dissappoint!

The spice level is where it should be - they are not afraid to spice things up. The service was very good... not fast, but I expect to wait a bit for freshly made food.

Their soups (esp the Rasam) are very good. I love the variety of chutneys that come with the Dosas.

First up -- Its REAL SOUTH INDIAN food. You know what i mean? As in the real &#39;REAL&#39;...The real spices, the real taste , the real heat, the real aroma...
Let me start with dosas - The chutney you normally get in any restaurant on devon is called &#39;coconut chutney&#39; with a domination of coconut. In priya its more &#39;Andhra&#39; (A south indian state) style where coconut forms the minor portion and fried &#39;chana dal&#39; is hte major ingredient. And they also serve &#39;Onion&#39; and &#39;Ginger&#39; chutney....one word ..&#39;WOWWWWWW&#39;

I tried the chicken curry, chicken chettinad, chicken 65, chicken chilli, shrimp masala, chapathi, puri masala, rava dosa, pesarat, idly, babycorn manchurian..All were fantastic but for chicken chettinad.....

If I have a craving for some REAL indian food, this definitely is my go-to place. Dakshin on Salem drive is a super close competitor.

Dakshin has its own special dishes where it scores. But then Priya truly deserves a 5-star.

P.S. :  One of those INDIAN restaurants were INDIANS get some respect along with FOOD...:) :)"

Different in the sense that it is actually one of those restaurants that serves authentic south Indian food. Make no mistake about it. Whether you&#39;re ordering the original Chicken Fry or the spicy Chicken Chitinad or the unmistakable Fish Pulusu, the taste is right there. Takes you right back to the sub-continent and makes you very nostalgic. The Indo-Chinese items, like the fried rice and the Chicken Manchurian or the Chili Chicken are very true to their original taste and are quite good. Priya also does a variety of tiffins or breakfast items and they are tasty too, though these days most Indian restaurants get them right. But what sets Priya apart is their Dosa (or crepes) night on Thursday, where you get to experience a variety of Dosas made with different kinds of batter and stuffed with your choice of filling - well this depends on what kind of Dosa you order. And vegetarian food here is good too with the ever-popular Panner Tikka Masala, Tadka Dal, Kadai Panner and other regulars gracing the menu. Ambience and interior settings wise Priya doesn&#39;t score well but who cares as long as the food is good, right? So head over to Priya you&#39;re craving real, authentic south Indian food."

Gradually, like most Indian restaurants, they tried to cut corners while increasing the prices and now it is very mediocre. We had  stopped going there for a few years and when a Groupon came out a few months ago, we decided to try it out again. Big mistake, the quality still is poor. The trick they use is to have foam take out containers which bend internally so that it looks like they are giving you a lot but you find out later that you got ripped off. Biryani was awful. I will NOT be going there again."

Now the place opens up for buffet at 6 PM or so. I would say if possible arrive before 6.45 PM or so. After that the crowds start building considerably and you may need to wait a little bit to be seated.

The buffet itself is somewhat of a unique offering (it is priced at $9.99)

They have about 20+ varieties of dosas from which you can choose as many as you like as many times as you want. Now the dosas  are somewhat small thus the waiter itself would suggest you to choose 3 or 4 at a time.

The other items of the buffet includes appetizers such as pakoras, 4 types of chutney (coconut, peanut, tomoto-onion, ginger), idli, upma, different podis for dosa, sambar,  aloo onion subji (as in masala for masla dosa), pulao, curd rice, dessert (usually kulfi), chai (welcome addition I would say).

Now it is quite amazing that they keep running like a well oiled machine despite the crowds and all the multiple requests they get for  different types of dosa. Usually with this type of arrangement there is a greater chance for pandemonium but surprisingly  I have been served dosas typically 5-10 minutes of my requests (for a group of 4).

A great and unique experience for serious dosa lovers."

Recently when hubby suggested going again, I was excited. We went for a saturday lunch buffet. Ugh..they didn&#39;t have real utensils or plates and bowls. It was around 12.45 pm and practically all the food was gone. We waited for 20+ mins but no one refilled/restocked the buffet.  There was just 1 waiter guy who promised to bring us dosas. We got exactly 3 dosas for the 3 of us. After that, we told the waiter at least 4-5 times to bring us more dosas and he just didn&#39;t. What kind of service is this? 
After being charged $15 for a buffet, we couldn&#39;t even get more dosas! This is after they have advertised it as a lunch buffet with unlimited dosas.
There was a lady at the reception and she could not possibly have been more unfriendly. She just frowned at us and when we pointed out that we didn&#39;t get the dosas but did like the food she just rolled her eyes at us.
The food would have been decent if there had been any. Not sure why this place was so packed. It certainly couldn&#39;t have been for the negative customer service or the lack of food.

It was crowded, which I expected, but the dosas took FOREVER to come to our plates, by which time the masala was completely cold. The upma was okay--the only thing I could palate at all. There were literally no decent options for vegetarians as far as veggies went. The rice dishes were bland and around three-fourths of the way through our meal, we noticed that the big &#34;appetizer wok&#34; which had chicken tikka or something had been replaced with one containing pav bhaji, which we vegetarians would have loved to try BEFORE stuffing our faces with substandard stuff. Dishes took a LONG time to be replaced, and I don&#39;t like eating oily curries, dry pieces of chapathi/parantha, and bland rice, when the meat-eaters have SO many options to choose from.

Chicken pakoras were out of this world. Chicken briyani was pretty good as well. Try the weekend lunch buffet. This place is spicy, so not for the faint of heart. Caters towards indian clientle.

Ambiance was mediocre to poor. Loud music was blaring and I requested them to lower the music but I dont think that was done.

I brought in a coupon from the Entertainment book. It was a buy one entree get one free. I presented the coupon once paying and the manager came to me telling me that the previous owner of Emersons signed up for this Entertainment book coupon offer and he no longer works there and they are trying to ween out this deal. He said I can use it in the future but I would have to order 2 of the 4 total Entree options they offer (which honestly don&#39;t seem like good options). 

All we ordered was a salad and a steak sandwich, and we come in once a week...are you really not just going to accept the coupon and take off the $9 salad? You want me to come in and force the other person I&#39;m with to order one of your 4 entree options (which if you have time, please look at the 4  options. Nothing great and they are more expensive)

I thought this was a poor decision by the newer management and it honestly will affect the frequency of my visits. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from.

If the burger I had here couldn&#39;t ease a hangover then I don&#39;t know what could because its not like the mac n&#39; cheeseburger was small or unfulfilling by any stretch of the imagination.

Being the cheeseburger expert that  I am I pinpointed the biggest, beefiest, most spectacular burger on the menu - the mac n&#39; cheeseburger - but I didn&#39;t realize it was is going to be THAT big and THAT beefy.  This burger was friggin&#39; ridiculous, but oh-so-good with its thick, juicy patty and fried mac n&#39; cheese on top...I could barely fit my mouth over the entire burger.  The burger is about the only thing that enthused me, however.

I did have a blue island iced tea (for about $5 for a huge glass) which was descent, but I&#39;ve had better long ice teas in my time.  However, it was a good combination with the ridiculous burger.  I&#39;d say that the beers on tap are better than their cocktails - there seems to be a lot of Goose Island selections at this bar so if you&#39;re a huge fan of this beer then you&#39;re in lucck, my friends.

Personally, I&#39;d choose to have many the beers before those they had on tap, but believe me - I&#39;ve seen worse selection.  The bar itself was pretty much the fashioned in same way that every other bar is so there&#39;s not much to say about that, but the waitresses did seem to be somewhat unknowledgable about the menu items so you were pretty much on yor own with figuring out details about the food and drinks.

This isn&#39;t my favorite bar, but it&#39;s a nice local bar that seems to be frequented by many people in the surrounding area."

I know it&#39;s a busy night for the World Series but their lack of basic customer service was appalling. We&#39;re regulars but we felt like nothings. They wouldn&#39;t take reservation, but couldn&#39;t get us a  table more than 1-1/2 hours before the game. When we were there for dinner the night before, they didn&#39;t tell us they would let people call in for the wait list and we were just the fools who listened to their advice to arrive early."

In my opinion it was better before, but what can you do, and the menu now is still good! They have more &#34;conversational&#34; burgers and by that I mean their &#34;mac and cheese burger&#34; and &#34;grilled cheese burger&#34;, almost better to Instagram than to eat.

Nevertheless, Emerson&#39;s food is great! We always get the Groupon for two that comes with two flights of beer and two burgers, so I&#39;m always looking to get the burger as an entree. I&#39;m really glad they kept the Royal burger (used to be called Roy-ale haha) because that is a show stopper! Bacon and a sunny side up egg on a burger.... so decadent! Since they got their new menu, I&#39;ve ordered the southwest turkey burger that has pepper Jack, avocado, onions, bell peppers and chipotle mayo; overall a great burger. I know they have a huge craft beer selection hence why the flights are such a fun thing to get. I definitely choose Emerson&#39;s when I&#39;m looking for a high quality burger."

Of course, we had a discount coupon.  We chiselers almost never pay full fare: we are classic, old school, tight-fisted cheapskates.  

Emerson&#39;s has a few outdoor tables facing Emerson Street (presumably the source of the bar&#39;s clever and innovative name), and there were a few cute females eating there, whom I pointed out to my wife (who threatened to do something to raise my speaking voice a couple of octaves).  We stayed inside, enjoying the magnificent view of Oberweis Dairy across the street.  I couldn&#39;t get Emerson&#39;s wi-fi signal, so I used the dairy&#39;s.

Emerson&#39;s is a toned-down sports bar, with a pretty good selection of beers and a not-so-great display of sports memorabilia (mostly Chicago BlackHawks stuff).  Most of the TVs were tuned to a college women&#39;s softball game, the others were tuned to an infomercial channel (who knows why).

Our server was a nice fellow who was friendly without being cloying.  My wife ordered a beef sandwich, and I ordered a small steak sandwich (or was it the other way around?).  The servings were big and loaded with fries and condiments.  It was bar food, not what I call gourmet stuff.  The meat was too salty for my tastes and I think that the greasy fries could have been wrung out and the effluent used for lubricating automobile axles or other tools.  

I did not have any alcoholic beverages, but I noticed that they have specials most days of the week.  The bar menu did mention they offered a lot of &#34;Long Island&#34; teas; but their menu did not include Long Island Whitefish.

I consider Emerson&#39;s to be kind of a Plain Jane sports bar: no activities nor games for their patrons, and rather limited seating.   So, I think that it is OK for some people, it would not be the right choice for my tastes."

I would recommend not getting any actual entrees but to rather stick to the short list of appetizers that they have on their menu. We ordered the cheese curbs because they did not have mozzarella sticks. I would stick to ordering liquor and beer from this place rather than ordering the food. The food here is nothing special and desperately lacks in flavor.

The atmosphere opens up to a large circle bar right in the middle and tables surrounding along the sides. This place is very dark and did not have that many customers. I would recommend if you need a place to get a beer go here if it is your last option."

Food tasted alright but we will not be back as we go in good faith trying new places finding new restaurants to enjoy. Clearly their goal is not to find new customers.

First the good: 
Service was excellent, very friendly server, and when we needed something our server was right there. Questions were answered quickly and with a smile. 

Our groupon included two &#34;Classic&#34; burgers with fries- the fries were good and the burgers were excellent The fresh meat patties and butter bun worked together to make my taste buds sing an opera. I was a bit disappointed that no ketchup/mustard was brought to the table with our meals but we soon found that the burgers were just fine without either condiment. The burgers were huge and they give you a massive pile of fries; when we were done, we were literally stuffed like a Thanksgiving Turkey. For a small up charge you can enjoy your burger on a pretzel roll (the ones we saw being served looked good). There is also a gluten free bun option for an additional $2 for those people who are interested. I&#39;d say go for the butter bun because it was excellent.

As many taverns are doing these days- Emerson&#39;s offers a couple of &#34;non-beer&#34; draft choices including an alcoholic root beer and a couple of hard ciders. Terri tried the &#34;Ciderboys Grand Mimosa&#34; which is a hard cider mixed with oranges. She declared it &#34;A-OK&#34;.

Now for the not so good: 
While we were at Emerson&#39;s, the fire alarm went off not once, but twice. I would not normally mention this, but it was an ear piercing and uncomfortable experience that was very much unpleasant. I certainly would understand one random malfunction, but to have it happen twice, with the fire department showing up the second time, is harder to forgive. 

Our included &#34;beer flights&#34; only were good for certain draft beers unless we wanted to pay an up charge for the more interesting drafts on the beer list (beers not included were indicated by a &#34;star&#34; on the beer list). Unfortunately the drafts that were included with our groupon were common for the most part and not very exciting in my opinion. You have to be the judge as to how you feel about this because for most people beer is very much a personal choice. They do have their draft and bottled beer lists online for your perusal. In my opinion, their bottled beer list looks more interesting so that would be the way that I would go when I visit again.

I think we will try Emerson&#39;s another time because I see a lot of potential in the place- parking was easy and it just seemed like a friendly neighborhood gathering place. I&#39;d say the positive outweighed the negative so I am going to assume that it was just an off night that deserves another chance."

Beer flight - I got the Grapefruit Schofferhofer, Skull &amp; Bones Imperial Pale Ale, Edmond Fitzgerald Porter, and the 312 (had to get a familiar one just in case). The grapefruit was by far my favorite beer out of the four. It was really light, refreshing, and citrus-y. I think I may have discovered a beer for future purchase!   

Martini flight - comes in cute little martini glasses. The chocolate one tasted just like chocolate milk. Other favorites were the mango-tini and the apple-tini. (Can you tell I&#39;m kind of a fruit person?) 

For my meal I got the mushroom swiss burger but substituted the swiss for manchego cheese. It was a fairly standard burger on a pretzel bun - not bad but nothing special either. I thought the mushroom really added more flavor. Fries on the side were standard as well.  

Overall, not a bad place to stop if you&#39;re in the area but I wouldn&#39;t drive 30+ minutes just to eat here."

The beer list is actually decent (though kind of pricey for the good craft beers) and the food menu is small but sufficient.

The food isn&#39;t as good as I would expect for the price and type, but the main reason I kept coming back was the friendly bar and wait staff. They&#39;re wonderful people. 

Management, however, is another issue. Last night the manager on duty came over and told me he was skipping the song I had played on the jukebox. He clearly felt my taste in music was just weird and bad, and that&#39;s how he approached the conversation. He offered to refund me the money for the play, which is fine, but I don&#39;t know if he realized that the one dollar wasn&#39;t the crux of the issue. He informed me &#34;the customers&#34; (not the &#34;other customers,&#34; but &#34;the customers,&#34; as if I wasn&#39;t one of them) didn&#39;t want to hear it. There was one group of about four at a booth, and one guy sitting by the door waiting for a friend. Myself and they were the entirety of patrons at the time. So I asked him if the customers had complained. They had not. I had asked him if he had asked them about it. He had not. I pointed out that I was, in fact, a customer, and I was the only one about whose opinion he was sure.

The song was, yes, probably unusual for a bar, but it was a dead Wednesday night. It was some meditative middle-eastern music with a good drum rhythm. I have no way of knowing, but I wonder if the sound of middle-eastern music has now become a source of anti-muslim instincts in our country.

Now, it wasn&#39;t just that he skipped my play. It was the half-smirking attitude that I should know better and not be so unusual. The guy could&#39;ve told me in a way that said he really was sorry but he just felt he had to, and that he understood my disappointment. And for crying aloud, he could&#39;ve bought me a beer to show me he cared and wanted to be a good guy about it. NOT because I want free drinks, not at all, but because the gesture would tell me I was still welcome in spite of what he felt he had to do.

I don&#39;t write this review just to moan about this incident, but rather because it was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. When the new owners first took over the place had an exciting, revitalized feel. And the owners were directly involved. Now I never see them and the nice human-touch and personal style they had isn&#39;t there anymore. I now feel like I&#39;m just another barstool-warmer, interchangeable with whoever.

Bartenders and managers, know your customers. And be good to your regulars. I&#39;ve never seen that group in the booth there before, and they seemed to be having a great time and not noticing the music. They may or may not be back, but it won&#39;t be because of the tunes. However, I definitely won&#39;t be back."

I usually reserve one star reviews for food poisoning or the equivalent, but this place was horrible.  I went here with a friend and we both decided to do flights.  She got the beer flight, which she enjoyed.  I got the martini light which was horribly unpalatable.  If you know me, I LOVE martinis.  This flight had four martinis... none of which I finished... they were that bad.  Or burgers were dry and overcooked.  The service was terrible and the waiter never even check in to see how our food or drinks were.  A great concept gone terribly wrong... avoid this place!"

I like the decor and I especially like their pizza!  I like Gino&#39;s and Uno&#39;s and Emersons pizza is like a combination of both, leaning more toward Uno&#39;s.  It&#39;s not a pan pizza, but it has that crispy, buttery crust taste like those places.  (From the pictures I see posted, it looks like the crust is burnt.  It certainly wasn&#39;t when I had mine.)

I&#39;ve had dinners and lunch at Emersons and I&#39;ve always had attentive service every time I&#39;ve eaten there.  

Most recently we stopped there for drinks on our way home from a movie. When we sat down for drinks one of the owners, Bobby was sitting at the bar and he saw us come in so he got up to serve us.  (We are not regulars and didn&#39;t know Bobby from Adam).   I told him we wanted a night cap so he suggested a Frangellco.  We got it on ice .  As I was drinking mine I realized they had a hard to find root beer beer (made by a small brewery in Wauconda.  It tastes just like a sweet root beer... only 19% alcohol) so for the second round I ordered a root beer beer and  instead of a Bailey&#39;s he suggested my wife have a rum chata.   I tried a little of the rum and it was very good.   We enjoyed ourselves and will certainly go back. 

One other nice feature of the bar is their complementary salty bar snack is strips of bacon!  Nice touch."

Seating took way too long. Three employees walked past us before the 4th finally seated us (we even made reservations one week beforehand). 

My martini &#39;flight&#39; was terrible. I only sipped a little bit of each sample, but my husband enjoyed his beer flight. *Note* if you&#39;re using a Groupon only certain beers are included in the beer flight. 

The &#39;Sissy&#39; burger (for the vegetarian folk like myself) was tasty, but super salty. I could make the same burger at home for $3 and half the sodium, but I did devour every last bit of the burger...and 3 glasses of water because of the saltiness.

Hubs enjoyed his patty melt and took home leftovers, but he didn&#39;t have rave reviews either.

We sat on the patio with friends. This was very nice except for the blaring Blackhawks game. Our waiter was much better than the previous 3 employees who ignored seating us, so that was well appreciated.

Far more pricey than we would have liked to have spent. $50 for 2 people (including the Groupon and tip). 3/5 stars overall. Experience was very average."

The bar is really dark inside, which I like, it reminds me of bars up in WI.  They had a huge variety of beers, but their special was $2 Miller and Bud Lite Taps, so how can you pass that up?  They also had .50 cent wings, we had 6 BBQ and 6 Buffalo, and these wings were HUGE!  After looking over the menu, we decided on a pizza.  We ordered a 14&#34; because it said it was thin crust, boy were we wrong! See my picture......It was gigantic!  The pizza was different than any other pizza I&#39;ve had, it was good, but different.  So trivia kept on....and so did our losing streak.....

They publish their lists on Taphunter, which isn&#39;t very popular so don&#39;t look for them on Beermenus. Hopefully they will figure that out soon.

Everyone who worked there was attentive and friendly. Street parking wasn&#39;t too horrible. The place was kind of loud but I expected that, especially on a Friday night.

I may or may not have taken a &#34;selfie&#34; video of me walking out of Emerson&#39;s Ale House asking for Oberweiss Ice Cream (which is located right across the street, FYI).  

My husband and I were meeting another couple here on a Friday night.  They highly recommended this place, so we were happy to oblige :)  There was a 20 minute wait when we got there, so we went to the bar and ordered a drink.  That&#39;s where this place loses a star for me.  The bartender was efficient, but she had a snotty attitude the entire time we were there.  Like we were upsetting her by ordering drinks.  Strange.  So we settled up there and headed to our table.

They had purchased a Groupon for a beer flight and a burger for each of them, so that&#39;s what they ordered.  I ordered an Appletini (the beginning of my amateur video debut) and my husband got a beer flight.  I ended up ordering the fettucini alfredo, and my husband got the grilled cheese w/ fries.

The food came out somewhat quickly (and the appletini went down even faster!  NEXT!) but both burgers that our friends ordered were charred.  Like WELL WELL done, and they ordered medium.  They tried, but they were inedible, so they sent them back.  The waitress was really apologetic, though, so good for her.  My husband&#39;s grilled cheese was amazing (it WAS National Grilled Cheese Day, after all!) and his smart addition of jalapenos really added to the flavor.  

My alfredo was gooooood.  Not only was it good that day (after a couple of drinks) but it was good the next day, too (completely sober).  Sometimes alfredo can be hit or miss the next day, and doesn&#39;t reheat well (the oil separates and the noodles get dry and it&#39;s just a hot mess!) but NOT this alfredo.  It was delightful the next day as well.

So in addition to the yummy food, Emerson&#39;s also has standout drinks like Root Beer Beer.  Yes, you heard me right--I did NOT stutter!!  It&#39;s Beer that tastes like root beer and it is SUPER potent in its alcohol content, so be on your toes!!

I would definitely come back for the food and drinks.  Maybe not sit at the bar next time, though ;)  I wouldn&#39;t want to ruin that lady bartender&#39;s day!!"

I&#39;m used to cold (ice cold) martinis, so I did not finish them, as if I added ice, they got watered down.  I&#39;ll go back, but I&#39;ll drink beers next time!

I think someone should talk to the management about the purpose of offering a Groupon.  The general idea is to get people into your establishment so that they will return.  You give them a good deal so that they are willing to pay full price when they come back.  Unfortunately, the management at Emerson&#39;s Ale House has decided to nickel and dime (or more accurately, several-dollar) the Groupon customers, leaving a bad taste in my mouth despite the good food.

The Groupon deal was for two burgers and two beer flights.  However, the Groupon deal only included their basic &#34;Classic&#34; burger--there was an extra charge for any other burger.   The Classic is $9, and they had the &#34;Roaster&#34; on special for $8, so we asked if that could be included with the Groupon since they were actually charging less for the Roaster than for the Classic on the day we were there.  Nope, extra charge.

The next part of the Groupon deal was a beer flight, which was 4 small glasses of beer.  However, the Groupon only included the beers without a star next to them on the menu.  We were told that if we chose beers with a star it would be an additional $2.50 PER BEER added to the cost of the flight--potentially adding another $10 to each person&#39;s bill despite the fact that the Groupon allegedly covered a beer flight.

We felt like this was bait-and-switch, and an attempt to get extra money from the Groupon customers.  To receive the burger and a beer flight of our choice, we would have each had to pay up to another $15 each on top of what we paid for the Groupon.

There are a lot of burger and beer places out there.  We won&#39;t be back."

We got the nachos and I wouldn&#39;t even feed those to my dog. The salad was iceberg lettuce with 2 pieces of a tomato. Beer list was decent, but the groupon only allows you to choose certain beers. To say your an ale house and highlight the beers on groupon and then give you a limited amount of drafts to choose from is deceiving. However... The burger was pretty good.

And there we waited.  And waited.  Watching the bartenders, waiters, waitresses and hostesses all standing around and chatting, without a care in the world.

So after trying to get the bartender or hostess&#39;s attention multiple times, we finally decided that even a discounted meal - one that was already paid for - wasn&#39;t worth it and got up to leave.

That seemed to finally get the bartender&#39;s attention, who finally looked our way and acknowledged we were there...10 minutes after we sat.

Needless to say, too little too late.  We were happy to walk to Blues Bar and spend money at a place that seemed happy to actually have business.

I gave it 2 stars because the service was pretty bad and because they had about 1/2 the number of beers on tap.  Selecting beers and especially beer flights are annoying when the waitress has to keep checking about what&#39;s on tap.  That&#39;s also probably why the service was bad as I imagined this takes up her time.

You get four 5 oz servings for about $11 so live a little and try something new! There are a decent number to choose from including a delicious root beer beer! The higher alcohol percentage is masked by the sweet flavor so the buzz may sneak up on you. 1/2 lb burgers are certainly big and tasty too. You&#39;ll be full after eating that and the french fries. Everything else on the menu is typical American bar food. Emerson&#39;s is a pretty small place. A square shaped bar is in the center and tables are along the perimeter. Definitely a nice little spot to grab some food and drinks.

The two things I loved best about Emerson&#39;s.  $.50 wings on Mondays, we ordered 6 mild and 6 bbq.  They were big and crispy and meaty.  Veryyyyyyy good!

From the pictures on Yelp, I thought their pizza was thin and crispy.  It turned out to be thick and puffy.  It has a unique taste, not bad, not great, but unique.  The sausage reminded me of Chuck E Cheese&#39;s, but the pepperoni was spicy.

I felt the bartender should&#39;ve advised us that the 14&#34; thin crust pizza is WAY more than any two people can handle.  She was very nice and a good bartender, so I won&#39;t hold it against her.

We sucked at trivia tonight.  The guy running the trivia had as much personality as the penguin on his shirt.  Maybe I&#39;m just sour because the fat hillbillies seated at the end of the bar were blatantly cheating.  Phones out, yelling answers, and cheering loudly when the correct answer was announced.  Not cool.

Awesome wings, eh pizza."

I tried a burger and beer flight. The burger was mediocre but I liked the sweet potato fries. The beer flight was very good since I was able to Rey other beers the. I normally would have.

I parked in the bank parking lot across the alley. May have not been quite kosher, but it was quite convenient for downtown MP. My car did not get towed or ticketed, but take my advice with a grain of salt.

They have minimal patio seating, which was full when we arrived, so we sat inside. Its very dark inside, with a typical pub feeling. Plenty of TVs for the sports fans, but not too loud for those who want to catch up with friends.

I give 3 stars for the food. I had a burger, which was good, but nothing super special. I felt similarly about the rest of the table&#39;s orders - standard bar food. However, they have an awesome selection of beers. My BF ordered a flight of beers to try some new things, and they even threw in a 5th tasting for free! They have a lot of (very) local beers, including some new breweries that don&#39;t even have their bottling facilities yet (Not Your Father&#39;s Rootbeer, I&#39;m talking to you).

All in all, a fun local suburban spot to hang out on a weeknight or weekend with some friends and have an old fashioned good time."

I&#39;ve enjoyed the 2 burgers I&#39;ve had there and their appetizers have been solid as well.  

The atmosphere is that of a regular dark bar so don&#39;t go looking for ambiance, but for what they advertise vs what you get, I think it was spot on.  Looking forward to my next flight of beers with the ever changing taps.

Having never been here before, we read the reviews on here and were nervous about what kind of service we would receive but we both had a good time! We were greeted when walking in by the bartender and got a booth immediately. There were a few open tables overall and by the time we left the place was pretty full (and we went on a Wednesday evening betweeen 6:45-8ish). The place isn&#39;t huge by any means so be prepared for that.

Stephanie was our waitress and was very nice and knowledgable, when a few beers we selected for our flights were unavailable, she had suggestions that were similar to what we wanted to try. My husband was already well aware of the Root-Beer Beer they offer and was excited to try it. It was everything he hoped it would be and the sampler was the perfect size for the beer, a full glass may be too sweet. 

We started with Mozzarella sticks which were good, could have been a little warmer but overall fine. We both ordered a Classic burger and I added avocado to mine. The pretzel roll was a great addition to the burgers and both of ours came out cooked correctly. Fries were good but I didn&#39;t get too many &#34;whole&#34; fries, more pieces of fries and we each got a nice size dill pickle spear.

Overall Emerson&#39;s is a nice place to get away from the chains if you want to grab a quick bite to eat. Not a huge menu but a nice sized one but really come here for their beer selection."

They have a nice list of craft and premium beers to choose from for the beer flights and a huge selection on tap! I asked the bartender/server about a beer she was pouring for another customer and she gave me a free sample-nice! I also noticed another customer had gotten the martini flights and they looked pretty good as well. 
The burgers were tasty and large with some good fries on the side. Nothing to write home about, but certainly satisfying (my friend couldn&#39;t finish his because it was so large). 
We sat at the bar and the server was friendly and relatively attentive, though there were only about 3 other parties there on that Saturday afternoon.

I liked that there are samples available to try since the beer selection made it challenging to decide what to order.  All of their house-brewed drafts were good with unique flavors.  My favorites are Fallen Angel and Confessional IPA.

They have $6 appetizers from 3pm until close and I tried the Solitude Stout Burgers and the N&#39;awlins Chicken Sliders. They come with two sliders each and a generous pile of fries. To be honest I was pretty full off getting two of these plates. Food was really high quality and you can tell they don&#39;t skim on high quality meats and fixings.

Cubs game special also had $5 beers from some really awesome breweries in the area and from far. So if you don&#39;t like their 6 or 7 beers on tap they have a ton of other choices.

Rachel-
Sorry to hear about the wasp issue from the other night.  Since seeing your review and also seeing them first hand, we have sprayed the nest and contacted our pest control company in order to eliminate them permanently.  I am glad to hear that the food and all was excellent but wanted to let you know that I saw your review and took the proper steps to ensure the safety of our guests.

Came here tonight with my husband for our date night. It was beautiful outside so we asked to be seated outside. Not a problem. We were sitting against one of the glass walls closest to all of the plants I guess you could say. We were towards one end and there were there columns as part of the glass wall. I noticed a wasp fly into the cap of one of the columns. Wasps totally freak me out. I thought meh, just one wasp, not a big deal. All of the sudden 3 fly out! I told my husband we had to move tables. We moved to the table across the way. When our waitress came back we let her know of the newly discovered wasp nest and that&#39;s why we moved. She said it wasn&#39;t a problem. Now what kind of bothered me was they say people at the table (we had already alerted them of the wasp nest) I didn&#39;t notice when they say their or the fact that the lady who was now sitting their had hung her bag over the pole covering the entrance to the wasp home - and when I noticed it was too late!!! There were about 10 wasps swarming the strap of her bag!!! By the time we left there were probably about 20! It just bothered me that after letting our waitress know about the situation, people were still seated there and it caused a very stressful eating experience. Thank god we left before she had to get her bag because I&#39;m pretty sure I would have been in tears (I&#39;m that afraid of wasps!!) the food was good. My margarita was a little weak. The pouting was blah. The burgers though, wow they are filling and soooo good! I could only eat half and I took the other half home where I will be enjoying it in my wasp free environment! Don&#39;t worry we will still return."

Love their burgers, love their tacos, love their salads, love their fried pickles.... and now I love their brunch (DISCLAIMER: It is only offered twice a year, so don&#39;t show up at 10 one morning hoping to devour some eggs and bacon  They do Brunch on Mother&#39;s Day and I believe the other is Easter.

Being my first Mother&#39;s Day all I wanted was a nice brunch, but I didn&#39;t want or need a buffet.  Somehow we thought about Lucky Monk and boom, their website is advertising a special Mother&#39;s Day brunch menu.  All of the items look delicious so we made reservations.

Get there on Sunday and the hubby screwed up with reservations (sorry about that guys), he made them for 3 (him, myself, and my mom) but forgot to say that we would need a highchair.  So where they have us seated will not work, however, they say they can seat us outside under the shade -- totally fine and it ends up being perfect.  Their patio is adorable and it sits a lot of people!  They have a fire going to have some heat in the area and we are all super comfortable.  They have patio furniture by the fire, seems like a great way to sit out there at night and have some drinks.

Our waiter, Mark I believe, is fantastic.  Always checking on us at the right time and making sure we were pleased with our meals.  OMG our meals.  Hubby and I both got the Shortrib Benedict and they were to-die-for.  He had this exact meal in New Orleans and stated this version might just be better.  My Mom got the Mushroom Benedict and while ours is insanely decadent, her&#39;s is light and refreshing.  We also ordered French Mimosas (OJ, Champagne, and Chambord --- can you go wrong?!?).  And they are only $5, that says a lot for South Barrington.

I met my sister here for dinner and really enjoyed my experience! The hostess asked if we wanted to sit in the dining room or the bar, so we opted for the bar area. Even the bar had a nice mix of high top tables and some booths, so I was happy to be sat at a booth. Our waitress was nice and attentive. She checked up on us a lot and was a trooper when it came time for us to order, because it took us forever to decided since we kept gabbing away!

The menu has a great mix of mouth watering appetizers, salads, soup, pizza, fish, sandwiches, burgers, tacos, and desserts. It was hard to choose! My sister recommended the tacos, so I went with that and got the skirt steak tacos. These babies include 5 mini tacos filled with pasilla &amp; ancho chile marinated skirt steak, avocado, five-chile cheese sauce, roasted salsa, and sour cream. Plus is comes with a side of Mexican rice, refried black beans, and a lime. These little juicy bites were delicious! Well worth $12.95. The best part was that this meal was the perfect portion. I definitely cleaned my plate, but felt perfectly content afterwards (not stuffed and not starving).

I was going to stick with just water, but then I of course started browsing their beer list. I was intrigued by their own beer on draft, so I ordered a pint of their Confessional which is an American IPA and a hop lovers dream. I definitely suggest giving it a try.

My sister lives and works nearby The Lucky Monk, so I look forward to plenty of future visits! Lots more of this menu to try..."

Came here on a weekday after work and it really hit the spot! Started with a spicy margarita and Trappist Trio -yum.  If you like Bbq sauce ask for a side (they have the good kind).  Next got a basic side salad...and don&#39;t call me patty melt.  Our server recommended that.  I thought if I&#39;m going to try a place for the first time FORGET ABOUT THE DAMN CALORIES! Happy I was in a careless mood cause it was worth it! I added fresh jalapeños and ordered another size of Bbq sauce and got the fries. Yum!!! Need to come back to try other things on the menu!"

Ordered a medium-rare burger with cheddar cheese and no bun with fries on the side and their own oatmeal stout.  The burger was cooked perfectly. Juicy and tender with tons of flavor. Great fries, perfectly seasoned. The stout was thick, dark and potent.  And the Cubs were on TV winning a World Series game. Overall, a very nice visit."

Lucky Monk has been a favorite spot for a while now...but I just realized recently that I had not given it a review on Yelp. My bad.

To quote Chris Farley&#39;s character in Wayne&#39;s World 2 &#34;Good food...good brew...good tunes! I&#39;m gonna go pick a fight!&#34; Although I WON&#39;T be picking a fight, he pretty much nailed Lucky Monk in a nutshell. Below I&#39;ll breakdown what I enjoy by category, but I find it hard to believe you&#39;ll be disappointed if you color outside of these lines.

The Food:
- Smoked chicken wings appetizer - good luck sharing these because they&#39;re.....heavenly (I see what I did there). Great seasoning on the outside with brown sugar sweetness. Accompanying sauce is on point. These are the best smoked wings I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;m a KCBS certified BBQ judge.
- Tacos - pick your fish and you can&#39;t go wrong. They&#39;re smaller, so keep that in mind when sharing
- Fish n&#39; Chips - Awesome! Nicely battered fish, good fries, tasty dipping sauce. Amen.
- Honorable Mention.....Cheese curds - these aren&#39;t quite Wisconsin quality, but prettttyyy close - I&#39;ll take it, they&#39;re delicious
- Confession: I&#39;ve actually never had a burger here, but they look amazing, and I&#39;ve heard great things. Please forgive my sin.
The Beer (try them all &amp; do a flight):
- Cardinal Sin (Pilsner) - good starting point, crisp and refreshing
- Tritica (Weiss Beer) - for the wheat fans, also tasty
- Monk&#39;s Choice - here&#39;s where it gets interesting, this is the seasonal offering and typically awesome
o Barrel aged barleywine - my most recent monk&#39;s choice selection (I bought a growler)
The Atmosphere:
- Depending on when you go, the patio area is very nice. You face away from the traffic of Barrington road, but you also don&#39;t get consumed by AMC or 90. We usually request to sit outside whenever possible
- The bar is also great, and it&#39;s the plan when it&#39;s too hot or too cold to sit outside. Very comfortable, inviting, and accessible.
- The music - I sometimes think I dropped my iPod in the parking lot, and they found it &amp; plugged it in - I&#39;m not tooting my own horn, I just meant that the music is more my taste than say (for example) a classic rock or country bar, which seems to be the norm these days. Praise the lord!

All told, Lucky Monk is great. I haven&#39;t had a bad experience, and I wish I had spent more time here before moving away from the neighborhood. Luckily I can still come back whenever, but if you&#39;re on the fence, I HIGHLY recommend giving LM a shot. 

Enjoy, and peace be with you."

the-lucky-monk-south-barrington,Amber D.,Pnc-oEFcFsgwJrRJMJu8vQ,"Fox River Grove, IL",0,1,0,25,196,DKChN5Y_V_Gof1oKeKWWIQ,4.0,2016-05-14,"Last night was my second time here, and being it was a Friday night, of course I expected it to be packed. As it was, my boyfriend and I were told a 15-20 minute wait and that is approximately how long we waited, which isn&#39;t bad at all for a Friday night. 

We were sat at literally the smallest table in the restaurant (the waitress even told us so), which was pretty annoying because 2 drinks and an appetizer barely fit on the table. We ordered the cheese curds for an app and they were delicious.

I&#39;ve been here before and had the turkey burger and loved it, but wanted to try something different this time. It was my boyfriend&#39;s first time here, so he ordered a beer flight and the Southwest BBQ chicken salad. I ordered a bowl of chili and side Caesar salad. I was not aware that the &#39;bowl&#39; was going to be so large, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have ordered the salad as well. If our waitress was better at her job, she would&#39;ve said something about the difference between the cup and bowl size.

Our waitress, Taylor, was not the friendliest, although she wasn&#39;t mean, just seemed uninterested. Now I use to be a waitress so I understand that it gets busy and you aren&#39;t in the mood to make small talk, but if you want a good tip, I would suggest having a better attitude and being more attentive to your tables&#39; needs. That being said, once we received our food, we couldn&#39;t eat it because there was no silverware on the table. We waited I think around 3 minutes before our waitress actually came back to check on us to see that we weren&#39;t eating because we had no utensils. I also waited another 5 minutes for her to fill up my glass of water.

I dug into my chili, which was delicious, but being such a big bowl I expected to have more of the condiments to put on the chili than what they provided. There was a dab of sour cream and barely a sprinkle of cheese and a few diced onions. Now I&#39;m someone who likes the works in my chili and was a little disappointed that I wasn&#39;t given a larger portion for my huge bowl of chili. Since I was already so full from the cheese curds, I didn&#39;t bother to say anything to the waitress. The Caesar salad was disgusting. Lettuce was soggy and the dressing didn&#39;t taste like Caesar at all. The croutons were mush, so I took 2 bites and called it quits on that. My boyfriend really liked the Southwest BBQ chicken salad and the beer flight was pretty good as well. 

They brew their own beer (in case you didn&#39;t realize this place is also a brewery) so of course if you&#39;re a beer lover like my boyfriend, you gotta try the beer. Now I hate beer, I&#39;ve tried many beers and have hated them all. However, this one beer on the flight I tried I actually enjoyed. It&#39;s their Weiss Beer, which had a banana bread flavor and didn&#39;t taste hoppy at all. I would definitely go back to buy a growler of that.

So overall, the food is decent. Our waitress was a little ditsy and inattentive, but I can&#39;t speak for every server there. We will probably be back, although probably not on a Friday night."

Friday at 5pm I called in and asked for a table for 2 for 5:45. The hostess said she can&#39;t reserve a table less than an hour in advance. So I ask if there&#39;s a wait at the very moment and she said no and she can&#39;t guarantee there won&#39;t be a wait when we arrive. 

We show up at 5:45 and maybe 80% of the tables are available.  Maybe it was her first day?

This receptionist needs better training by restaurant management in serving customers. If someone calls in requesting to eat at their restaurant you put a smile on and do whatever it takes to meet their needs.  Forget policy, customers don&#39;t care.  They choose to eat at places with great customer service and that usually comes with the same level of food &amp; ambience. 

I&#39;m giving 5 stars again because our server Dan (Red) was great; he knows the beer list and the food menu inside and out. The burgers are the perfect portion with a balance of great ingredients, but the fries are below average...quite soggy."

We ate here today - an early dinner around 4 before heading to the movies. We sat down right away and were served super fast! 

The menu was about what you&#39;d expect for a microbrewery, but the food was so much better than you&#39;d expect! Their skirt steak street tacos were amazeeeee, and poutine for an appetizer? Don&#39;t mind if I do! Their beer was a win, too (I would know, I sampled all 6 of them)! The Tritica Wheat Ale and Solitude Oatmeal Stout were my favorite. 

Next time I want to try their fried pickles and house-made sticky donuts (but not at the exact same time)... Mmmmmmm!

I&#39;ll definitely be back soon!"

They always accommodate us well and the food quality is dependable, consistent and better than most gastro pubs that I have been to.  This last visit, we had to wait for our table way beyond our reservation time and the kitchen had a hard time to get the meals out.  The manager shared that they were slammed that night and brought out 4 appetizers compliments of the house.  Nice gesture and the next time we come, we will order those appetizers as they were amazing.  Nachos, pretzel w/dipping sauces, humus/pita, and fried pickles/cheese balls. I ordered the skirt steak over a bed of lettuce and although slightly over cooked, it was tender and flavored well.  I skipped the beer this time, but  their craft beers are normally served at the perfect temperature."

The person I was with and I both got salads and split a 12&#34; pizza. We both had leftovers..and probably too much food. Their portions are huge, one entrée is shareable. Depending on amount of food you&#39;d like to consume.

The salads are huge!! One was the Waldorf Salad, if you&#39;re a fan of fruit in your salads it was delicious. The other was the wedge salad, with chicken and bacon. Also delicious. The pizza, was okay, not too special though. It was thin which wasn&#39;t a terrible thing but could have been better. 

The witness was sweet enough to bring me a free dessert for my birthday as well. Some type of donuts, also pretty good! 

I&#39;d check it out if you haven&#39;t!"

It&#39;s right off the highway, yet has valet parking and the place was absolutely packed. Walked in, and got seated immediately... At a table with a little reserved placard. Not quite sure how I got fancy, but I&#39;ll take it. The servers are a bit over attentive if I had to make a criticism. I can read a menu and I can also check out the chalkboard on the wall for beer specials. But, I would take that over being completely ignored by the wait staff so all in all, it&#39;s okay. I ordered one of their specialty drinks that they had developed especially for the NCAA tournament, which I thought was creative and fun. I wish they would have had a Manhattan, but I settled for an old fashioned. A little strong, but I&#39;ll take it too.
Our server offered a sample of their Oatmeal Stout, which I gladly accepted and then ended up ordering with my meal...

 And holy moly. This meal... This was a burger that I have told probably 15 people about, and every single one of them looked disgusted. I ordered the Elvis, which is one of their great burgers cooked just how I liked it, with bacon peanut butter and bananas. Don&#39;t knock it until you try it, seriously. There&#39;s no ketchup, lettuce, or tomatoes... No condiments at all. Just a beautifully cooked burger, bacon, peanut butter, and bananas. Instead of fries, I subbed out for their soup of the day. I&#39;m also not ashamed to say that I am a grown woman who was moaning over a bowl of crab bisque. I&#39;ve had a lot of crab bisque, all over the country, and this was absolutely stellar. Temperature was perfect, consistency was perfect, the amount of crab meat was perfect... I really wish that they would sell it online so I could order it and have it shipped to me. My biggest issue with the Lucky Monk Is that we don&#39;t have one close by my hometown. Absolute high five."

There is nothing better than an ice cold micro-brew with said burger. 

If you&#39;re looking for craft burgers and micro-brew beers, this is the place for you. 
The Lucky Monk offers an expansive menu of burgers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, appetizers, and signature entrees. 
I always come here for their excellent craft burgers and brewed in-house beers!

The atmosphere in the restaurant is very modern and contemporary. 
However, don&#39;t feel out of place, it is VERY comfy and intimate. 
The bar area is excellent to catch the game. However, I prefer the spacious and comfy booth!

We started off with an order of their Wisconsin Cheese Curds. 
The curds were plated elegantly with a tomato-marinara and a slightly spicy chili aioli. 
The breading seasoned, robust, and light. 
The cheese inside was melty and gooey! 

To quench our thirst, we ordered the Confessional IPA. 
It had a spicy kick with accents of refreshing citrus. 
The large glass runs about $5.50. Totally worth it for the price. 
The quality is impeccable. 

Service here is top-notch. Our server, Donato V. did an excellent job recommending meal items, as well as the excellent IPA. They truly take customer service here to a whole new level. We were able to space our order out and never felt rushed. 

Next, we decided to both order a craft burger. 
Their burger selection is top-notch and you can customize the burger exactly how you want it. 
You have a choice of a sesame seed bun, brioche bun, or dark rye bread. 
The cheese selection is wonderful as well. Tillamok Cheddar, Gruyere, Merkts Cheddar, and  Pepperjack are among the choices. 
You can add a fried egg, avocado, whatever your heart desires!
They have an excellent patty melt, (will try next visit) as well as a burger where the buns are TWO bacon grilled cheeses! 

The burgers are served on a neat pedestal, showcasing the true beauty of a fresh, craft burger!
The hand-cut fries are hands down the best I&#39;ve had! You simply can&#39;t go wrong!

If you thought I was done, think again! I knew I had to order dessert when Donato recommended the House-Made Sticky Donuts! They come out piping hot, sprinkled with powdered sugar. The donuts are glazed in a sweet, delicious glaze. With the donuts, you are treated to a raspberry, caramel, and chocolate dipping sauce. They are sinfully delicious and well worth saving room for!

I can&#39;t wait to come back to try out the highly recommended &#34;Don&#39;t Call Me&#34; patty melt and the fresh, hand battered fish and chips! Unlike other places, they don&#39;t use frozen fish!

The Lucky Monk prides itself on fresh, never frozen meats and fish. Additionally, none of their items are &#34;pre-made&#34; or frozen. This is as good as it gets folks!

If you love their beer, they have a little cooler filled with beer to take home!

If you want excellent burgers, beer, and ambience...check it out for yourself!

You will not be disappointed!"

Ordered the bbq salmon which was cooked on cedar plank. I thought it would have had a rich smokey taste; maybe the strong tangy bbq sauce wiped it out. Either way, it was tasty that I finished it all. Large beer selection, but the taste of their own brewed beers didn&#39;t stand out. our waitress was great; very attentive and checked in on us fairly often. 

I would have considered giving a higher rating, but the poor service at the hostess stand put a bad taste in our mouths as soon as we walked in. They first said its 45 min wait at 8:00 for a party of 7 (3 were kids). Then they told us they&#39;d seat us sooner since we had 3 small children and everyone else waiting were couples. As we patiently waited, we watched the bus boys clear up several tables and sit empty as the hostesses continued to have personal conversations. It must have been a juicy topic b/c they were laughing and not paying much attention to the guests standing around. As we stared at a few large tables ready for seating, we watched the hostesses seat everyone including parties of 2 that just walked in. Then when we were the only party left waiting, my husband walked near the hostess stand and obviously looked behind them at the large empty table that had been empty for a good 10-15 mins. It was just then that the hostess noticed and said  &#34;I can seat you now.&#34;  They really made us wait 45 mins. I don&#39;t expect special treatment b/c we have small children with, but I don&#39;t appreciate hostesses making promises they don&#39;t keep, servicing others coming in after us, and us having to interrupt their conversations to hint to them that there is clearly a table ready and there was no one waiting. 

The parking lot was packed but not surprised for a sat night. They offer complimentary valet parking, but the line was pretty long that it was faster for us to follow those leaving the restaurant and taking their spot. 

We&#39;ll likely return after a few months in hopes the service upon entry has improved."

It&#39;s big, spacious, with plenty of parking. They had numerous tasting sizes to fit your mood.  The beer was good and the menu had a nice variety of options. 

I went with the steak mini tacos... They looked sooo good. But they were sooo salty! It made me drink my beer faster along with a couple glasses of water. The calamari was crispy and just as salty. I guess that was the going theme of our lunch. 

Staff was friendly and attentive. Maybe it was my food choice.. I would try this place again, later..."

They offer indoor seating and outdoor seating by a fire place.  it is a nice place to take someone on a date, especially since it is right next to the AMC theater.  The food is decent. I commonly ordered the fish and chips and each time it was a huge portion and we&#39;ll cooked.  I recall having a steak in the past and it was cooked rare, but once I got it, it was well done.  I didn&#39;t complain since it was still good, but was not what I ordered.  this happened to me twice but I feel as if because of the amount of customers they get, it is hard to keep track.  otherwise, they have a wide variety of options to eat from. From pizza to burgers and many more.  this place also has a bar with a few tv screens to keep up with sports for enthusiasts."

Décor: The interior is decorated like a restaurant (mainly) and a brewery (secondly). It&#39;s a nicer place and is quiet large - any size group you have should be able to be accommodated. The lighting is decent, not super bright as to set a more relaxed and laid-back mood (which works). I did not, however, get a look at the bar area but it, too, looks nice.
Bathroom: clean and inviting, well looked after - just make sure you go in the correct one (I accidently went into the woman&#39;s room at first... I guess it pays to double check haha... thankfully it was empty)

Staff: Our waiter was pretty nice but seemed a bit off. It was just small occurrences, however, like him not hearing our orders (and it wasn&#39;t exactly loud/busy in there). For example, we had to correct him several times on our ordered items as he was walking away.

Drinks/Food: We had beers and wine (some homemade craft brews and some other) and they were tasty. We started with the hummus (decent) and the chicken wings (good sized and good flavor) before moving on to our meals: the Trout (enjoyable), the salmon (tasty, the sauce was decent), a burger (amazing! Their burgers are GREAT!), and the roast beef (yum). Everything was tasty and fine, but nothing blew us away (except for the burger, which was outstanding). The food selection on the menu is solid, the execution is just on par.

Value: The prices are about what you&#39;d expect but I think the drink prices are a bit high ($5 for a Miller light?).

Overall, Lucky Monk is a decent place to try if you have never been. We&#39;d return for another burger but other than that..."

  We always start out with their warm pretzels and NO restaurant comes close to the Lucky Monk&#39;s pretzels, mainly their dipping sauces. This last time we also ordered the cheese curds, once again delicious!

  The drop in 3 stars has been coming for a while now. 

  First, their quality in beer has declined, sometimes it&#39;s a carbonation issue and other times it&#39;s the taste. I have noticed my favorite beer &#34;the fallen angel&#34; has gotten more bitter of late and is unappealing to me anymore. I tried their Oktoberfest the other day and wow... one of the worst Oktoberfests i&#39;ve had all year. Not east to drink at all..

  Secondly and most importantly, they keep changing their menu and not in a good way. First they removed their ever popular beer braised short rib pasta, that was a huge mistake. This dish was my wife&#39;s favorite and was often so popular that they wouldn&#39;t have the short rib in stock. So my wife found a new favorite dish.. and once again they changed their menu and removed that dish from the list. 

  Basically all the Lucky Monk has become is a pizza and burger restaurant.

  There has been a sign in front for a while now that reads hiring ALL positions.. That could have something to do with these changes. Did a head chef leave along with all the delicious food? Did the head brewer leave?

  Finally, please do something about your fries.. they are not tasty.. They taste burnt every time.."

As far as apprizers my favorite are the cheese curds which comes with a chipotle dipping sauce. 
I have had a variety of entrées but my all time favorite are the crispy fish tacos. Lastly we tried a desert for the first time and it was the sticky donuts and it was absolutely amazing with three dipping sauces: chocolate, raspberry and caramel. 

This is a nice environment and when the weather gets nice there is outdoor seating and a bonfire pit. The ambience is nice, it&#39;s a classy feel, this is a great place for a girls night, date or even casual dinner and drinks. 

I have never been disappointed with the level of service I receive there. They ran out of the stout that I usually get after my first glass, they suggested a different on which I didn&#39;t like, and they took it back and let me pick another one."

The ambience of this place is great. Decour is nice. Beer selection is good. As well for the mixed drink list. 
 Staff welcoming and friendly. But the food was not something to really brag about. My burger was a bit on the salty side. The sweet potato fries not the best I&#39;ve ever had. Cheese curds good. Truffle fries 50/50, pickle chips - different. 
Steak tacos - ok. 
So the only thing I can say is that I am glad I stopped by and tried this place. I cannot really say I will be returning. because it wasn&#39;t the most appealing to my taste buds. 
But to each its own. Would not steer anyone away from trying this at least once."

Nice decor and fairly large space. Pleasant smelling when you first walked in. The music was perfect for the place.

The door greeter was pleasant, but my server Laura was the bomb. Everything she recommended was great, although we will butt heads about the King Burger.

The beer: Laura recommended the Cardinal Sin house brew draft. Good flavor with a little of a bite. It kind of reminds me of a little stronger Stella. Highly recommended.

The apps: I had the Trappist Trio which was truffle fries, cheese curds and pickle fries. These came with three dipping sauces; spicy, chipotle ranch and tomato fondue.
  A) The truffle fries were good.
  B) The cheese curds were fantastic. Just the right amount of breading and seasoning. You didn&#39;t need to use any of the dipping sauces for these.
  C) The pickle fries were the best rendition of fried pickles I have ever had. Very light on the breading and seasoning and just the right amount of salt. They paired perfectly with the tomato fondue.

All of the dipping sauces were good with the tomato fondue stealing the show. I would sure love to have that recipe.

The King Burger: Okay, so this was not specifically recommended by Laura, however she convinced me that I should try it. I can say that it is not of my taste. However, if you like to try something new or kind of pay tribute to the King, then this is the burger for you. It&#39;s a burger with peanut butter mousse, banana and bacon. The patty (handmade) was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of spice. This was definitely the best cooked burger I have ever had. 

Personally I would recommend a different burger than the King but either way I don&#39;t think you can go wrong.

Although I came a little early do to travel times I think you should give this place a shot. It&#39;s well worth it."

Everything was great when we got there. The food was good. We were trying different beers, then our main course arrived.

My girlfriend&#39;s burger was medium well instead of medium but it was good and juicy still. My pastrami was fantastic. We just never saw our server again. We had to ask another server for more ketchup. I wish I got her name because she was great. After almost 25 minutes without seeing our server I went to the host stand to see if they could help us. Thankfully it was the same girl with the hostess who had helped us before, and she got our box, another soda, and our check.

I loved the food and the beer it was just upsetting to leave with a sour taste in our mouths due to being forgotten about. Hopefully the next time we go we won&#39;t be forgotten, because the food and drinks were good enough to warrant a second trip."

It&#39;s just a nice, well managed restaurant. I&#39;ve been here more than 5 times and the food has always been great and I&#39;ve always gotten a beer or cocktail and haven&#39;t been disappointed. 

Every waiter and waitress I&#39;ve had has been knowledgable and patient and they seem to actually like their jobs which I feel like makes all the difference in your experience anywhere.

The Parmesan truffle fries are awesome, burgers are huge and served on this platter that makes them look even bigger! It&#39;s a little terrifying till you realize that it&#39;s not that humongous haha

I&#39;ve had people ask me what&#39;s good place for a date, or for a group or to grab a drink or good for families and I&#39;ve recommend The Lucky Monk every time for all those occasions. It&#39;s a well rounded restaurant.

Had a great experience at the bar the other night too! Our bartender was really nice to my friend and I. The bar had slowed down at that point so there wasn&#39;t much excitement happening so it was good to have a server that made us feel welcome!

Keep up the good work, I&#39;ll be back soon!

On busy nights though, make a reservation. This is a good restaurant and it shows, don&#39;t get angry when they tell you it&#39;s a two hour wait and you couldn&#39;t take the time to make a phone call. Quality is worth waiting for!"

The service was on point. Our waitress was funny, informative, and met all our needs. But as for the food, it didn&#39;t really leave anything special behind. Your typical restaurant I guess, I would recommend trying White Chocolate instead.

I remember last time visiting here feeling happy and satisfied, now leaving here thinking man what happened. 

I ordered the Margarita Pizza. The taste of this pizza seems lower than Mariano&#39;s Margarita Pizza. However, the donuts redeemed the place. I remember last time I visited it was superb, and again they were on point. I would recommend getting the donuts."

Excellent service on a busy Sunday afternoon. Jason was awesome in providing vegetarian options to choose from. 

Started out with the Pickle Fries, chips not strips. Delicious, but greasy. We were starving so they were amazing. 

We ordered the Patty Melt (forgot the full name) and the Hot Pepper burger with the spelt patties. Both were amazing and huge portions.  I&#39;ll have enough for another two meals. For the sides we chose truffle fries and cheese curds - also pretty darn good.

I came here specifically because I had a taste for their fantastic pretzels.  Well they are fantastic no more.  They now taste like those bad ones you buy in a box at the grocery store.  Nothing special about them at all.

I had crab bisque and an adequate Waldorf salad.  My Old Fashioned was all watered down with ice and thus I received ZERO buzz on this typically strong drink.  The only good thing this place now has going for it is its beer selection."

We ordered Moscow mules &amp; monk-aritas. The Moscow mules were ok, nothing special. The monk-arita was better.

For appetizers, we had cheese curds &amp; calamari. Both were hot &amp; fresh &amp; good. 

For entrees, we ordered a grilled cheese burger, n&#39;awlins chicken sandwich, a patty melt, &amp; 2 BBQ burgers.

Everyone said their burgers/sandwich/melt were good. 

I ordered the grilled cheese burger, per the server&#39;s recommendation. It was ok. I guess I expected more considering it sounded so amazing on the menu. I liked that it had pieces of bacon in the grilled cheese &amp; then in the actual burger. My biggest problem was that I ordered it medium rare &amp; it was almost completely well done. Not good esp since the server suggested med rare over rare, saying that they do it really well here... 

Still, I had a good time here. The place is lovely, the food is decent, the server was nice. I just wasn&#39;t that happy with my burger. Everyone else liked theirs, so maybe it was just mine.

I think I&#39;d still come back though. It&#39;s cleverly located right next to AMC movie theater so it&#39;s easy to come grab dinner &amp; watch a movie after :)"

The assured us that it was no problem.  However, the four of us sat at that table for over an hour with only our drinks.  The food we had ordered was no where to be found.

My husband got the beer sampler and seemed to enjoy it.  I went for the IPA which was quite nice and very drinkable, just a simple not overdone IPA. I chose the chicken tacos.  They are mini tacos and super cute :/)z. The green salsa was out of this world. The beans were awesome.  I hate 90% of it which was much more than necessarily but shows how delicious it was.

I thought a $2 upcharge for coleslaw instead of fries was ridiculous, i think for another $2 you should get both. Doesn&#39;t make sense, honestly plating coleslaw in a side dish can&#39;t be more labor then deep frying fries....
Anyways, the drinks aren&#39;t very good and mixed drinks are pretty weak. Lots of beers on menu not in stock. If you got a lot of $ to blow go for it. Patty melt &amp; ribs are awesome &amp; that pretzel app is delicious too.

We started off with drinks and then it took the waiter 20 minutes to come back and take our order.  Not a good start for a first impression. We had a Trappist Trio for apps and it was AWESOME.

To be fair, if I was a beer aficionado, I&#39;d probably be more definitive in my rating. But for now, it&#39;s really a 3.5. I don&#39;t think everything is a winner, and last visit, the server seemed a little surly (we all noticed). But typically, our servers have been friendly and knowledgable in the past. I do love the ambiance. It&#39;s a large restaurant with a nice aesthetic, and can be kind of romantic at night with it&#39;s dim lighting. ;)

The food is mostly hit, but there have also been some misses for me. The truffle fries and cheese curds are delicious. I have a harder time turning down the fries than the curds, surprisingly. They used to have a ratatouille dip appetizer served with flat bread, a favorite of mine, but they have taken it off the menu, disappointing. The burgers are pretty solid. Juicy and thick, and always mouthwatering. Salads are good but nothing special in my experience. What I found soooo delicious, and it will be hard for me not to order it again (carbs), was the beer-braised short rib pappardelle. So freaking good! They are somewhat light on the meat (which is ok by me), and it&#39;s $17 which seems a tad overpriced a la carte, but man is it good. Perfectly cooked, cascading, delicate pasta, yummy sauce. It&#39;s surprisingly light, though I purposely only ate half. #willpowertested 

My biggest complaint is the pricing I think. One night I spent $50 for an app, hot toddy type cocktail, my pasta entree, and a side salad. Only the pasta was a standout. I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m cheap but I wasn&#39;t wowed so it&#39;s hard to justify the cost. But, The Lucky Monk is just a fun destination for me. My friends and I always look forward to going and trying out different menu items. The burgers are for sure the highlight for most people. But I will dream of that pasta for quite some time..."

The place has a great vibe and is full of life, lots of seating, and an even more expansive menu. Good luck choosing! We sipped on a Moscow Mule and Monk&#39;s Island Punch (essentially a mai tai) and ordered the Chicken Poblano Chili and Santa Fe Chicken Salad. All of it was great.

Had we not been completely stuffed (late brunch the day after Thanksgiving...smart), there were a dozen other items calling our names; pizza, sandwiches, and the Pretzel Platter which also happened to land on a neighboring table... Hello! Three pretzels the size of our heads would be a chore, though, haha.

I can easily see myself coming back and this being a 5. (I like to reserve my 5 star reviews for places that consistently deliver excellence or truly blow me away.)

It showed the earliest opening as 7:30, so we went without making a reservation thinking we&#39;d just sit by the bar until we got a table.

First off, our appetizer came within 4 minutes which was kind of suspicious considering how packed the place was. My boyfriend, who is in the restaurant business, explained exactly how he thought the appetizer was under a heat lamp for quite some time. The cheese curds were not chewy and the fries were drenched in truffle oil. The burger was pretty good but the bacon was hard and reminded me of a dog treat. The soup was not what we were expecting and rather disappointing. We didn&#39;t even bother dessert because this place was just an overall disapointment. The good reviews are definitely for the beer selection."

They can get pretty crowded on the weekends and parking will be a challenge. You should be good if visiting during the week though. My friend and I were seated at a table in the bar area. I was going through a healthy kick at the time I visited so I ordered a Waldorf Salad (but not before munching on some cheese curds - not exactly healthy). The Waldorf Salad was actually amazing and the blueberry cider I had (they had it in tap at the time that I visited) was surprisingly great. So catch an early movie and head to the Lucky Monk!

Whether sitting inside or out, you won&#39;t be disappointed. We love sitting outside in the summer. Even though you are close to the highway, it feels much farther away. 

The beer selection is good. They brew their own and have a great selection of craft beers. The menu runs from tacos to burgers to salads, pretty much what you&#39;d expect from similar places. 

However, the food is really good. The tacos are great. The burgers are excellent and huge. If you&#39;re in need for extra fried food get the Trappist trio. 

They also have beer to go with growlers and bottles. I highly recommend ordering at least 30 min in advance if doing carry out."

My family of three came here for lunch on Saturday,3/26/2016. The restaurant was crowded but our wait time was still only 10 minutes. Our server greeted us promptly and made us feel welcomed. Our order consisted of the beer flight, kid&#39;s Monk burger meal, Superman burger, and a grilled cheese burger.

No complaints from any of us. My Superman burger was cooked perfectly and was so flavorful. It&#39;s been a while since I had a really good burger and this one hit the spot. The fries were crisp and seasoned with sea salt and cracked pepper. I was beyond stuffed but forced myself to finish my burger because I couldn&#39;t dream of reheating it the next day. That&#39;s just wrong!

Really nice place on the inside.  Service was good.  We sat in the bar area.  We ordered the Trappist Trio appetizer and split a 50/50 burger which was plenty of food.  Food was well done.  What drains the rating is the beer.  Place is a brewery which means beer should be the shining star.  We got a flight of what they currently had to split and wasn&#39;t impressed with any of them. Most of them were light on the malt which gave them a watery, thin, weak beer. The second round I got a Revolution Fistmas and wife got a Hoffbrau Dunkel in a bottle.  

On a side note, I am not sure how you claim to be modeled after monks and not have a Trappist ale or a Bock beer on tap.  And if you are a brewery and people come to eat and drink other peoples beer, then you have issues."

I would highly recommend making reservations if you do not want to wait a long time to be seated- particularly on a weekend. We were seated within 3 minutes of walking into the restaurant due to our reservation, and the wait time for everyone else was about 45 minutes. 

My husband tried one of the lucky monk brews- the seasonal offering- and enjoyed it a lot. I tried two different cocktails- the triple berry lemonade and the paloma- both delicious. We started with the trappist trio- a guilty pleasure of deliciousness that included cheese curds, truffle fries, and fried pickles- heaven in a trio. 

We both enjoyed delicious burgers for our meal- and had some food to take home. We skipped the fries with our meal due to eating them with our appetizer and had beer cheese soup instead- fantastic- and had some of that to take home too.

The food was dissapointing. The grilled cheese burger came over cooked with onion, the kids pizzas were very, very salty. sweet potatoe fries were burned and cold. The twisted chicken was ok but  didn&#39;t see any bacon, avacado was a smear on the bun.
By the time the server checked on us it was a bit late to get things fixed. 
It is a shame the menu made the food sound fabulous and filling. The portions were very small and we left hungry.

i can&#39;t attest to the beer or burgers (probably the reason why people go here) but after a long day at the pumpkin patch, this place checked off all the boxes. the vegi burger was nice and hearty and we devoured the shared sweet potato fries. all the burgers come awkwardly perched on what i like to call a tree stump. can&#39;t really tell you why that is. i&#39;m having a hard time describing their service. our server was very friendly, honest and apologetic (a few misunderstandings on the menu) but food came out slow and she was a bit absent."

Even their house Italian dressing is wonderfully balanced.

It&#39;s spacious inside and has a warm, romantic feel. The menu has everything from sandwiches, pastas, pizzas to BBQ ribs and steaks, something for everyone I guess. 

Their chicken dishes were very tasty: we had the Angel Hair Liguria (chicken strips, sun-dried tomato and such in a pesto cream sauce) and the Chicken Caprese (lightly breaded chicken, very substantial). 

I was not very impressed by the two seafood dishes I tried: Misto Grigliata (basically mixed seafood grill), an entrée-looking appetizer with an entrée-like price of $16.95. I liked the calamari and the sautéed spinach but didn&#39;t care for the octopus which was rubbery and a little bitter; Mussels with white wine sauce were tasteless. 

We also had one of their specialty pizzas once. It&#39;s called IL Colorata with tasty toppings like chicken, bacon, bocconcini cheese but we weren&#39;t too crazy about the thin crust. They do have other kinds of crusts. I am not a pizza person so couldn&#39;t say how this pizza would rank around here, with so many pizzerias in the area. 

Their house-made tiramisu was decent. The hazelnut gelato they carry was yummy. With two entrees, a dessert (or two), plus a glass of Tuscan Chianti ($7), our bill came close to $50 before tax. Groupon saved us $15. We usually had leftover pasta to take home.  

Service was attentive and friendly on all our visits.   

Not a bad place for a low-key romantic dinner (if you both love garlic) or a meet-up with family/friends if nobody wants to cook or venture far. With a big back room, it seems to be a good place for private parties as well. 

3.5 stars."

Only 3 tables were seated besides ours as it was still before dinner time.  Both entrees came with a side salad.  It consisted of some tired mixed greens and one tomato wedge.  Seriously.  Dressing was wrong on one and we had to send it back for the correct dressing.  There were no utensils and finally I had to go ask a bartender for forks.

While waiting eons for the grilled calamari appetizer I finally had to go ask the bartender to refill our drinks.  Waitress who took our order never came back until after our entree was served.  Calamari was finally brought out by a guy who happened to be walking through the door carrying in ice.  It was not quite cold but only better than room temp.  Flavor had potential, it could have been a good dish.

Entrée was brought out by the bartender, we had some sausage and penne dish and it was good.  Steaming hot and fresh.  Waitress came by and asked how things were, so I told her about the calamari but in a nice way.  I heard her tell someone as she walked back to take it off our bill.  When the check came out it was still there and I paid for it, consider it the price for knowing where to never take my wife."

It made me a little skeptical at first, but it was delicious.  For my mail meal, I had an appetizer again because I don&#39;t eat that much so I decided on the sausage and peppers, it was very good.  I usually don&#39;t bring home leftovers, and when I do, they sit in my fridge.  But I really thought it was so good that I had it the next day too!  My husband had the vodka pasta.

The owner was VERY great with communications and invited us back.  

We didnt go right away and we didnt go on a Monday.  We went Thursday the 4th (giving this information because I did not remember her name) AND we did not tell them we had a gift certificate because I wanted to see service and food without them knowing we had been there and had bad experience before.

WELL TALK ABOUT TOTAL DIFFEREN DINING EXPERIENCE.  The lady we had was amazing.  She was very friendly from time we were seated and we did not wait for a greeting or drink order.  The bus girl was so sweet and very attentive to all the tables.  The waitress was good and told us specials, asked if we had been there and what she recommended.  Everything was very promptly served. this time we decided to try the pizza and too her recommendation for the BLT pizza and it was SO WORTH IT.  Crust was perfect - I like a nice thin crust pizza, crispy without being burned and it was SO THAT AND MORE.  I was so happy with this great pizza.

They have great garlic dressing, not the thick lazy mayo garlic, but real garlic salad dressing.

The fried raviolo was soooo good, a real treat.

I was disappointed in the pasta because it was mushy, not aldente at all and I hate when places make ultra soft pasta...it isn&#39;t meant to be mushy.  BUT the alfredo was tasty and lots of chicken.

SO MUCH NICER EXPERIENCE AND we will definitely eat there again.

The food here IS very good.  It&#39;s in a strip mall, you&#39;d never know it was there unless you looked up while driving.

The good - The bad and The Ugly

First the bad-
The staff here really doesn&#39;t seem to know what they&#39;re doing.  The manager [some guy in a shirt and tie] was running around like a banshee trying to keep all his plates spinning, from seating to the bar area to the carry out counter.  They were understaffed, but the restaurant was not that busy.  The consensus after the first 5 minutes?  Everyone else including ourselves spent most of our time looking around for our server.  I saw one bus boy [with a ring sticking out of his nose that I wanted to rip off his face[[this is my issue..I hate metal sticking out of anyone&#39;s face in the food service industry-it looks horribly tacky and unsanitary]], and one waitress.  It was blazing hot over this past weekend, and the floor wasn&#39;t crowded, but the manager wanted to seat us directly in the sun.

Here is a tip for the staff, CLOSE the blinds to keep the sun out of our eyes and the temperature more cool if it&#39;s a 90 degree day, just saying lol.

Let&#39;s talk about the good
We are food snobs.   I can&#39;t help it.  I cook, I bake, and I&#39;m Italian if that says anything.  Momma likes to eat!  I know the difference between frozen anything-and a well balanced dish. The menu itself is pretty diverse.  I saw something on the specials that I NEVER EVER see on any other Italian menu [neighborhood or chain], which was Braciole [pronounced bra&#39;jawl-].  I had to get it.  The waitress looked at me funny when I asked about it, although she thought I said &#34;Bruschetta &#34;.  After we cleared the mix-up up, my husband ordered pasta with carbonara sauce.

There is nothing lacking in quality or portions here.  The asparagus on my plate was grilled to perfection and finally a chef remembered to take the hard outer skin off of it so it could be eaten instead of chewed like shoe leather!  The olive oil used to dip hot fresh bread before the meal was like a buttery consistency-which was a great surprise considering most olive oils used in restaurants are the equivalent old dirty oil that comes from a .10 cent generic can.

The meat was perfect, the insides were seasoned well, and the pine nuts were crunchy, not soggy.  The potatoes were whipped properly, the onion and mushrooms were done perfectly in what I can only describe as a proper Marsala sauce.  And after all of this, I tasted my husbands.  He was unaware that peas came in the carbonara.  I informed him that, THAT was the way it was supposed to be made!  His sauce was sheer perfection of cream, butter and cheese.  Long since gone are the days of salty &#34;tangy&#34; sauce which could only be produced by cheap sub par Parmesan cheese in an alfredo base.  It was so good, I wanted to trade plates!

Most of my reviews are short and to the point, but the food here deserved something more than bitching about the lack of staff on a holiday weekend.  It stood out all on it&#39;s own!!!!  And I cannot wait to go back and try something else.  I am *hoping* this will become our standby on the weekends.

My husband and I went on a Tuesday night, after buying a Groupon. There were quite a few people there (thought it would be empty).  We started with baked clams, which were some of the best I&#39;ve had in a while! Then we had cream of asparagus soup which was excellent. For an entree, I had cheese tortellini with prociutto, mushrooms and peas, in a creamy tomato sauce. It was very rich, and very good. I also tried the arancini, which was a bit disappointing, as it tasted like it had canned peas in it. (maybe I was just getting so full that nothing tasted good any more!). My husband had penne pasta with italian sausage, peppers, portabello mushrooms and onions. He liked it at first, but said it seemed bland and greasy toward the end. He ended up with stomach issues soon after. Both of our meals were huge portions for $14 each, which we felt was a good value. All in all, we would definitely go back."

However my experience at this restaurant warrants revealing a series of circumstances that I have never encountered before in any type of restaurant, regardless of size, class or distinction.   On January 27th, 2015 we were seated at table #32 and our server was R. Jr..  Our order number was 9016, the time stamp on the receipt is 6:36pm, I believe we arrived at about 5:15pm that day.  Having been at Rocco Vino&#39;s before and enjoying their quality of food and portion sizes, we expected the usual pleasant dining experience.  I ordered a Moretti beer with a glass.  This beer and glass was brought out on a tray, and approaching the table,  our server spilled the beer and it spilled on my clothes, my watch, the table and the floor.  The server asked if I wanted a new beer,  I declined, he was embarrassed enough and accidents happen.  As time progressed, I thought a manager or supervisor might stop by and extend some type of apologetic incentive, however that never occurred.  What also did not occur  was anyone cleaning up the floor, the table or moving us to a different table.  With white paper table coverings, the beer soaked into the paper and for lack of proper example,  became unpleasant smelling through our dinner.  We had to walk around the mess on the floor to avoid slipping on the spilled beer that was left uncleaned.  While I am glad I do not carry the liability insurance for this establishment, I am also  glad I have no investment in this establishment.  Such actions certainly are not profitable and may even be harmful to the patrons.  It may be that our server never informed anyone what happened, however it would have been hard to miss the spill and me using every napkin I could find to wipe off my arm and clothes.  There did not appear to be any experienced manager or owner present,  it appeared to be staffed by late teens and early 20s staff members, which in itself is not a problem, however the response to this was dismal.  If that was not bad enough,  when given the bill, I was charged for the Moretti beer that was spilled on me !!!  The server unfortunately paid for that mistake, I left him a .2c tip.  Keeping this in proper perspective, accidents happen,  you can&#39;t control what happens, however you certainly can control how you handle them.  In this particular case Rocco Vino&#39;s failed miserably, and without question lack professional management or protocol for incidents directly impacting their paying customers.  If I had spilled the beer, I could understand this flippant attitude, however this was our server who spilled on a customer.  It was insulting enough to not have a management staff member or competent adult address this, however when I was charged for the beer on top of the mess that remained that R. Jr. created,  it became clear that this cannot be left without notice to anyone considering closing this restaurant.  I, and my family,  loyal repeat customers have been lost, and I strongly recommend to anyone thinking of dining here to avoid it like the plague.   The one star is for the food, beyond that, please consider the 100s of other places that have more professional servers, management and ownership.  Rocco Vino&#39;s is a &#34; TAKE A PASS &#34; restaurant, and if one ventures into this restaurant, you will pay for their mistakes."

We were there rather early so the place was dead.  We were seated in a booth, only to have the only other customer in the restaurant seated directly behind us.  Any sort of private conversation would not be kept private for long as the atmosphere was dead and I&#39;m sure he head every bit of what we were talking about.

I went with a friend and we ordered some pretty basic items.  He ordered stuffed shells and I ordered a Steak House salad.  We waited for over thirty mins to receive our food after we ordered it.  The waitress joking the steak for my house salad was the reason it was taking so long.

When we received our food, the shells were already becoming &#39;hard&#39; and &#39;crusty&#39; and my salad was rather pathetic with only five strips of steak which was not cooked to order (rare, M-well, etc.), which left me a little confused as to why it cost me 11$ and we waiting almost forty mins for it.

This place has some potential, but they may want to re-visit some of the food they offer if they mean to keep their customers satisfied.  If I have a choice in the future, I&#39;ll most likely go somewhere else."

Go-tos here are the gulf ($11) and steakhouse ($10) salads, as well as their grilled paninis ($5.95). Sandwiches come with fries, which are not good, and the panini&#39;s can be on the greasy side... but they&#39;re still mighty tasty.

My deep dish pizza that I asked for well done was so soggy and disgusting that you couldn&#39;t even take it out of the box without it turning into what looked like a can of soup from 1776. When I called back to ask for my money back the manager was a complete asshole even though at this point I was still being polite and hung up on me. So I called back to tell him again that I want my money back and that his driver forgot 1/2 drinks. He said another pizza is on its way. One hour and twenty minutes later I had a box of cat food on my table. But at least the driver remembered my drink this time. The second pizza made the first look like a masterpiece.  So yet again I called back and asked for the manager.  All he had to say was &#34;I watched my cooks make it and thats just the way it is.&#34; This time I got my money back. I called pizza hut witch I recommend you to do. Its a third of the price and you get decent service, A delivery driver who can remember a pepsi, and a manager who isnt a dick head.

Food was much better this time, but I think they&#39;re prices are just too high for what they offer.  $3 extra for vodka sauce?  That&#39;s just nuts. The gnocchi with vodka sauce I ordered was ok, but the vodka sauce had a strange oily texture to it. Boyfriend ordered eggplant parm and said it was just &#39;ok&#39;.

The margherita wasn&#39;t the typical style margherita (NY style?) but it was still good.  Could have used a bit more basil.  Service was decent but took a while to get the waitress&#39;s attention.

I&#39;ll admit I have eaten more authentic Italian food than most; I go to Europe often and have tried many hole-in-the-wall pizzerias in Italy - Modena, Torino, even the small blue collar town of Pontadera.

Started with bruschetta.  The bread was the same as the table bread; they didn&#39;t even toast it.  Uh oh.

Well, of course, the litmus test of any Italian restaurant is a Margherita pizza.  And of course, the pizza tasted like something from a grocery store freezer.  Same flavorless pre-shredded cheese that every other place uses.  Forgettable (probably canned) sauce.  Is it really too much effort to go to costco and get a package of fresh mozzarella balls?  At least they remembered to put some olive oil on the pizza, so that earns them 2 stars."

We ordered the combo appetizer platter - our usual starter whenever dining Italian. I always have to eat the zucchini because no one else will. Luckily I love zucchini.

Girlspawn always - I repeat ALWAYS - gets fettucine alfredo whenever she can and she reported theirs to be quite tasty. 

Chicken Marsala was a bit overdone and dry. Glad it wasn&#39;t my meal. 

I was watching my carbs on this day so I ordered a salad. I don&#39;t remember the name of it but it came with jumbo shrimp and artichoke hearts.

There is the one in Carol Stream on County Farm and Army Trail as well as one in Elk Grove Village at Biesterfield and Meachum Roads. I&#39;ve only eaten at the Carol Stream one since it&#39;s so close to home.

I&#39;ve eaten there many times and never had to wait for a table. The food got progressively worse every time I&#39;ve gone to the point where I won&#39;t go there now. My son loves the place though and mentions it whenever given a choice on where to go to dinner.

I used to like the Toasted Ravioli appetizer and Vodka Sauce pasta dish. The pizza was never my thing. Unfortunately, the toasted raviolis have come out still frozen before or over cooked as often as at the right temperature. The Vodka Sauce is super rich and good but the quality of the pasta is lacking. Either the pasta is precooked, over cooked or just of poor quality. 

They do have a gelato (Italian ice cream) area to the right of the entry area when you come in. It&#39;s really good except some of the favors sit around too long and it loses it&#39;s freshness. Considering there&#39;s a Dairy Queen in the same shopping center and a Baskin Robbins across the street, skip dessert.

(pop) Oops, I guess my dream bubble just burst.

The restaurant itself was nicely decorated and had a warm, comfy feel about it when I walked in. The service staff was friendly. The bathroom was clean and well lit. Plenty of people dining. And the menu featured several tempting entrees. So far, so good...

For my meal, I started with a house salad with sweet balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It came with a nice variety of greens and one small wedge of tomato. I thought the lettuce was kind of limp like maybe it had been sitting unrefrigerated for a short time? But I&#39;ll suspend judgment until I receive the main course...

Since the name of the restaurant included the word &#34;pizzeria&#34; in the title (Rocco Vino&#39;s Ristorante &amp; Pizzeria), I chose the &#34;il colorata&#34; thin crust 9&#34; pizza which included fresh bocconcini (cheese), grilled chicken breast, bacon, red onion, Roma tomatoes and fresh basil. With the exception of the bacon, I LOVE all these ingredients! Unfortunately, I realized after the first bite of pizza (and the second, and the third...) that it had no flavor! Bite after bite, I searched for any hint of ingredient flavor recognition. The only thing I came up with were the fatty bacon pieces that you chew and chew and then have to pull out of your mouth because they&#39;re too fatty to swallow. I even pulled off the toppings individually to see if they had any flavor alone. And the crust? It appeared to be one of those pre-fabricated, round cookie cutter, &#34;cracker-type&#34; crusts that some places use for pizzas... tasted like one too. I was sorely disappointed at the quality of ingredients all the way around.

Well, I opted to skip dessert and had half of the pizza boxed to take home. Funny though... eating the cold pizza the next morning for breakfast actually brought out a bit of the tomato flavor.

I&#39;ll avoid giving them a one-star rating since I&#39;ve only dined there once (thinking that maybe the non-pizza entrees may be a little better). Of course, it may be awhile before I go back to try something different."

We dine at the Wok n&#39; Fire in South Barrington pretty much every month. This was our first visit to the Addison location. While we were seated and our order was taken pretty quickly, it took almost 20 minutes or more to get our sushi. It was Ladies Night and pretty packed in the lounge area, but we didn&#39;t expect to wait quite that long. Our server apologized that one of the rolls we ordered was wrong but asked if we wanted to try it anyway without being charged. Once finished, we asked her if the roll we wanted was still coming and she totally forgot about it! There only appeared to be 2 guys behind the counter making all the rolls. 

The positives? Easy to find and park (great location) and for 3 ppl, 4 sushi rolls and 2 drinks, our bill was only about $32 before 7 pm. We will probably stick to our usually spot in S.Barrington though."

The Good:
Came were with a group of 4 at 7:30 on a Friday night, got seated fairly quickly and our server was friendly.

The Specialty Maki Trio is a good deal.  Get 3 signature rolls for $38- not bad for Signature rolls. 

We ordered the Calamari and Crab Rangoon as apps.  Fresh and tasty.  Calamari was lightly-breaded and soft, not rubbery.  Crab Rangoon was crispy, crunchy, and the cream cheese filling was perfect.

My favorite sushi was the Inky Roll - the seared scallop on top was tasty, wrapped in avocado also added another layer of texture and flavor.

The Bad:
We ordered the Scorpion, St. Charles, Las Vegas and Inky Roll.  The Sushi rolls here were good, not great.  For the prices of the rolls on the menu, I was expecting flavor profiles that were a tad more complex and refined, but I felt as is the rolls were merely average - no particular flavors that stood out as amazing.

Scorpion - Was not a fan of the tuna on top - too pastey and the lack of flavor combined with the amount of tuna really masked the rest of the flavors in the roll.

The Ugly:
Our friends had ordered some bread for their year old daughter.  We received two pieces of sliced bread that was foul-smelling and borderline had gone bad."

The inside was so cute! It had a traditional look and feel.  I absolutely loved the decor.  My friend and I went for lunch.  We arrived at about 11:45 am and were seated immediately.  It was pretty empty.  

The waitress greeted us as soon as we were seated, took our drink orders and asked if we had any questions.  

I decided on a green tea for my drink.  It came out in a cute little tea pot with a small tea glass.  Why didn&#39;t I take a pic.. sigh.  

I ordered the Kung Pao with Chicken.  It was Firey Fresh and Good!  The food arrived fast and the ingredients looked and tasted so fresh!  I enjoyed it!  

During lunch my friend and I fell deep into conversation.  By the time we looked up the place was packed with people!  This to me says a lot about the flow and acoustics of the place overall.

We ordered the following:
Hong Kong Calamari app -  $10
Vietnamese Summer Roll app - $8

Kiss roll - $11
Spider roll - $10
Fantasy roll - $8
Negihamatchi roll - $8
Mexican roll - $13

= $68 regular total, so $34 pre-tax and tip.  Not bad for two of us.

Verdict: 
The Summer Rolls were okay. Though the I love my carbs and the noodles inside gave a good contrasting texture, it was a bit of a carb overload. Bok choy  (?) Was the only veggie present.

We LOVED the Calimari; it was seriously the best thing ever: large unbreaded calimari slices with veggies in a savory sauce... that is, UNTIL we found a 2&#34; piece of melted cellophane in the dish. Sorry, but that totally turned me off.  We showed our server, who apologized, took the dish, and deducted it from our bill.

The Spider and Mexican Rolls were the most distinguishable and tasty, whereas the Kiss, Fantasy, and Negi Rolls were all very similar (minus the asparagus in one). They were OK, but the smallest (number of pieces AND size) maki I&#39;ve ever had!  The good part was that you could fit pieces in your mouth without a struggle, unlike the monster rolls at my favorite AYCE joints. If we had paid full price, though, I&#39;d have felt ripped off.

Service at the bar was pretty poor: we had to flag down our server for refills because he was schmoozing with a group of girls drinking wine.  I guess that&#39;s what you get at the bar area, though.

I wouldn&#39;t go running back to Wok &#39;n Fire, but I wouldn&#39;t discount it if there was a deal such as the half-priced one we experienced."

I never get anything else here in regards to entrees so I can&#39;t give much guidance in that direction, but nearly every single sushi roll I have had here is very good. I have probably had nearly every roll on the menu up to this point. If you eat in the bar, you can get half priced apps and sushi depending on the time and day.

Service: the service is always good here, even when it gets busy!

Appetizers: The coconut shrimp are my favorite, but I also get the miso soup as well. Both are wonderful to snack on while waiting for the sushi to come out.

Sushi: Wonderful. If you order a spicy roll, you are going to taste some heat and good flavor, just how I like it! Each roll has a distinct flavor to it, nothing tastes fishy either. The sauces are good, the fish are good, some of the special rolls are exotic. I have not had a bland roll here before. I am highly picky about my sushi, but I find the flavor here to be distinct. While I have had better sushi at other local places, this place definitely keeps up as a spot I don&#39;t mind getting sushi at! The rolls are a little small here, so the more people that are involved, the more rolls you are going to need to get. For 2 people we often get 4-5 rolls. 

The sake is also good, my boyfriend and I will often get a sake flight here when we are looking for a good buzz with our meals.

All in all, this is a decent place to go get your sushi fix. The prices are not too bad and they get even better if you sit in the bar and get the half-price sushi. Good atmosphere, good service, good food!"

I have always gotten their sushi, chicken lettuce wraps, salads, fried dumplings, egg rolls and have never been disappointed.  I actually thought their sushi was pretty damn good, I was impressed on the quality and freshness, and the rolls were what you&#39;d typically find at a good restaurant and I&#39;ve eaten at a lot of good sushi restaurants. 

On my most recent visit (a week ago) my friend and I decided we needed a sushi fix and went here.  Walking in at 5:30 on a Tue., we were told all app&#39;s and maki rolls were 1/2 off....so we were super happy and dined in the bar area. Hostess was really friendly as was our waitress (who was very attentive as well).  Bar was not crowded at this time.  We ordered 5 maki rolls (mostly standard rolls), and appetizers: pan fried dumplings and crab cake.  As soon as the sushi came out I immediately noticed how small the rolls were in comparison to how they were in the past.  These were definately SMALLER.  In addition, the spicy tuna and tiger rolls were on the salty side. The fried dumpling filling tasted overcooked and dry...the crab cake resembled nothing of a crab cake, nor did it taste like one and served on a small bed of rice with a few micro greens on top?  Would definitely not order this again.

All in all, I believe in the motto you get what you pay for (most of the time).  The fact that we had no alcohol and our total bill before tip was $34.00 was pretty great.  The sushi was not bad, but not great this time around - but we were full and satisfied.

Its great to take advantage of their 1/2 off nights if you want to fill up on app&#39;s and sushi and aren&#39;t super picky about your sushi.   I&#39;ll give them 4 stars based on the good sushi I did have awhile back,  but for great sushi, I&#39;d go somewhere else."

Sometimes it was cut, sometimes it had sesame seeds, sometimes it was larger, sometimes it was half the size, and that last time I had frozen &#34;pre grill marked&#34; chicken. You know the frozen stuff you can find and Sams Club or Costco?! At first I thought that my food was under cooked, even my husband said that it tasted funny, so I sent it back. Then I waited over 45 minutes to get my &#34;new chicken&#34; that was a hockey puck, I waited OVER 45 MIN so that they could complete other tables but not fix mine first? It was then that we realized what kind of chicken I had gotten. I could hear the cook and the waitress arguing and the cook was not happy that i had sent my food back, which was why I wait so long, I&#39;m sure. The manager didn&#39;t really apologize to me or say anything the waitress said that &#34;she,&#34; the manager, took it off of my bill. Had I been able to talk to her I would have said something about the inconsistency of my food week to week as well as the inappropriate cooking staff. Normally I love the food here but after a steady decline of standards I probably wont be back for a while. The only reason its getting 3 stars was because my husbands food has always been great."

The decor inside is nice but the restaurant itself is small. I&#39;ve been here twice. The first time I had items off the regular menu and I loved it. The second time I came during happy hour and the food was just okay. Ideally I would rate this a 3.5 (3 for the happy hour menu and 4 for the regular menu).

Sat in the bar area (1st come 1st serve) and had wine and appetizers. The waitress was good and told us it was happy hour. Went back today expecting the same. Sat fairly quickly. Ordered the same and then were told it was only happy hour at the bar when we got our $79 bill. Asked the server to call the Manager. Explained that we weren&#39;t told and that neither servers had ever said it was only at the bar. She was not even intrested and said that it was too bad the host nor our server had told us before hand. So again we said the bill should be adjusted because the staff had not done their job and she said she couldn&#39;t. What&#39;s the point of being a Manager if you can&#39;t adjust a bill when clearly the staff wasn&#39;t all on the same page. Last time we come here!

The beer to awhile to come, water was empty for half of my meal, she refilled 2/3 glasses and did not take away the dirty beer class, then my chicken tasted like it was siting out all day.

Not the best sushi ever, especially for them being over-priced compared to other sushi restaurants. I mean, a Dragon Roll is a California Roll topped with avocado and unagi for $13. Where is the shrimp tempura like what they have everywhere else?? Plus, they charge almost $10 for their pho bowl. I couldn&#39;t have been more disappointed. I&#39;ve paid almost less than half of that at other restaurants that serves 2 people! Im not trying to be frugal, but I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m getting what I pay for. So, I only come here if there is a Groupon. Also, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for the waiters/waitresses to take a patron&#39;s phone away to redeem the paid Groupon at the register. Who knows what they could potentially do to it? Record the number and leave the phone! 3 stars from me...and that&#39;s for the Groupon."

We have caught the special happy hour deal on a few occasions and it is a solid value.  On Mon, Tues, Thurs &amp; Fri from 4:00 to 7:00 PM you can order Maki rolls and apps for 50% off.  Additionally, they have 20 ounce Sapporo&#39;s for $3.  The sushi and sashimi are good quality and it&#39;s easy to make a meal out of the apps and rolls.

Recently, 3 of us dined and ordered 2 apps, 3 rolls, hot sake and 4 Sapporo&#39;s.  The bill was just under $46.  The only downside is that the happy hour deal is only good in the bar area which is pretty small.

It took forever to get our food, people that came in after us got theirs first... Got an order of calimari and three orders of sushi. Calimari was ok, but the sushi was terrible, falling apart and super tiny and no flavor for the price I pay at a good sushi place.

Monday night is ladies night. $5 specialty martinis....I&#39;m in. Also 1/2 of specialty maki rolls. Done and done. Get the Jun roll, it was amazing, key notes: asparagus, jalapeno, avocado, spicy tuna. Bomb. Do it. I also had the Poppa&#39;s Choice roll, which was good, key notes: spicy tuna and mango. Still good, but that mango is really noticeable, and I didn&#39;t feel it necessarily meshed well with their particular spicy tuna.

My friend and I also split the tuna and avocado poke appetizer which I wasn&#39;t overly excited for when we were ordering, especially since we were getting all of the rolls for 1/2 off and the appetizer wasn&#39;t.....but I was so glad my friend suggested it. Super delish. It comes on a little tortilla chip, or &#34;crisp&#34; as my friend called it. You should probably try it.

So, here&#39;s what you missed last time: came for the happy hour and the food was amazing, but the service was absolutely horrendous from the hostess to the server to the manager...NIGHTMARE

Fast forward to my latest visit........................................................................................

For a quick going away meal before my train, my friend and I decided to hit up the happy hour special here (half off apps and select drinks!!!), taking our chances, especially after what had transpired last time - we were cautiously optimistic. Surprisingly, after arriving, we were greeted by the hostess, whom was very friendly and led us to the bar (note: happy hour special only valid in bar area) 

As quick as we were seated, our server, Tara, greeted us, told us about the specials, and got our drink orders. As usual, our eyes were waay bigger than our stomachs and we ordered:

CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS
Such a light and refreshing dish! There are so many textures with the cool crispy lettuce, unctuous ground chicken and crunchy fried noodles with a sweet and tangy sauce. YUM.

CHICKEN DUMPLINGS
These were nothing great - in fact, I know I can and have made better ones at home. Skip it!

CALAMARI
I&#39;m a sucker for fried calamari. It is so frickin&#39; tender and fried to crispy crunchy perfection! Just can&#39;t get enough of it. You just can&#39;t go wrong with this dish. It&#39;s served with a sweet tomato sauce - kinda like ketchup? SOOO GOOOD...get it!

CRAB CAKE HAND ROLLS
This dish is kinda a cross between sushi and a spring roll. There&#39;s a deep fried crab cake with rice, lettuce, avocado wrapped inside rice paper topped with a dollop of spicy mayo and sprinkle of sesame seeds - perfect bite! It&#39;s served with a yummy Asian slaw with cabbage, carrots, red onion and crunchy noodles - DELISH.

TUNA POKE
Poke is basically raw fish that&#39;s seasoned and marinated that&#39;s served throughout Hawaii. The poke comes served with crispy rice chips stacked up like a napoleon alternating with a layer of poke then chip and so on. It&#39;s served with pickled ginger and a wasabi sauce as well as a sweet sauce - I highly recommend this dish!

The service compared to my last visit was day and night. The food came out super fast and Tara was incredibly attentive even though there were many patrons in the restaurant, always making sure to check on us and refill our drinks. Additionally, there was different manager filling in who was very friendly and welcoming while we were dining. Overall, we had amazing and CHEAP food (only about $25 for 5 large apps) with great service! I can definitely see myself coming back again if they keep up what they&#39;re doing!"

I get a call from the owner Siri today - wow- can I say what a jerk? He is super rude, speaks in a horrible tone, and is not at all polite. I can see how insincere he was for calling me but did it just to do it. I could not believe that the owner was worse than his employees.

He calls me and talks to me in an accusing tone- basically defending his staff when really its literally my words against theirs and of course who would admit to fault on the job?? Wok N Fire gave me problems previously and I gave them another chance only to have another problem. 

He wouldnt take responsibility for the mistakes his staff made, he accused me of saying &#34;Ill just complain again and get another one of these&#34; that he says his staff said I had told them but there is no way I would say that. My husband and I clearly remember me saying &#34;you know the reason why I got this certificate was because of a horrible experience I had at the Wheaton Wok N Fire. Now Im going to have to call and complain about this experience&#34; to the &#34;manager Liz&#34; there. I dont know who was lying about this whole thing Liz or My server Giana but they are all horrible people.

I would say avoid this place at all costs-- Im all for supporting small business- you can find better food and authentic in other places other than a chain. If the owners of wok N fire dont care about their customer satisfaction and wont take responsibility for the poor conduct of their employees then who will? 

I would never support a business owned by a rude, arrogant, and irresponsible man."

Crispy Calamari - Nicely battered and tender.  They were fresh and didn&#39;t turn into a piece of gum in my mouth.

Tom Yum Goong soup - The broth was tasty and went well with the shrimps.  The large slices of onion threw me off since this soup is normally made without onions, but they were good.

Spider Roll - It wasn&#39;t as crispy as I would like and the sauce is too sweet.  I give it an A for presentation, though.

Bangkok Feast with chicken - Eh...it was very Americanized and too oily.  There were carrots, bean sprouts, red and green peppers (ew), pea pods, green onion, mushrooms, water chestnuts and tofu in a curry sauce.  I wouldn&#39;t order it again.

SERVICE:  Excellent!  I couldn&#39;t make it to the restaurant until 9 on a weeknight (they close at 9:30p) and they were more than happy to serve us.  Apparently, the sushi chef leaves exactly at 9:30, so you got to place your sushi order accordingly.  The one waiter left in the restaurant was charming and attentive.

AMBIANCE:  Very nice, modern and dimly lit.  The booths are as comfortable as the stand alone tables.

LEFT OVERS:  They gave me those round aluminum containers with a paper top for my left overs.  It&#39;s such a pain to bend the top every time to close it up and I can&#39;t get to my food fast enough.  I guess the plastic top ones are worst.

LOCATION:  Pretty easy to get to, plenty of parking, close to I-355 near Marcus theaters."

Food was a bit underwhelming--I ordered a &#34;seasonal special&#34;--the Five Spice BBQ pork ribs. The ribs were tender but chewy at the same time--probably needed to be braised longer--definitely gave the ol&#39; jaw muscles a workout. The seasoning was not what I expected--I expected a strong, complex 5-spice flavor with a bit of smokiness, but instead just got a sweet, candied flavor with only a hint of 5-spice. The ribs were outshone by the side of fried rice and Asian salad, which both tasted fresh and delicious. The fried onion straws were fried onion straws, nothing surprising. Would not recommend the ribs but other entrees may be better."

I walked in to meet a friend and told the host that. She said I could look around.  I didn&#39;t see my friend so I texted her. She came up to the front and told me she told the host and the server that she was waiting for someone.  They were not busy either.

Food: We ordered the Tuna Poke because it used to be my favorite.  I think they changed the recipe or something because it was nothing like how I remembered it. It was still spicy but there was barely any avocado or flavoring to it at all really.  The sushi we got was........just poor. The salmon that was used in the nigiri and rolls was very bad quality. The Philly Roll was super generic with no avocado or anything else in it and the mayo on the Mama&#39;s Roll tasted weird.  Honestly, I was a little nervous after the meal that I might get sick. Thankfully I didn&#39;t, but you should never walk away from a sushi meal worrying about that. 

Our server was just ok. Not bad, not exceptional.  I don&#39;t know that I will ever go back after the food being that bad.  :("

I&#39;ve had sushi everywhere, suburbs and city, this was spoiled and nasty tasting. We chose it because located close to the club we were celebrating my birthday at, but too bad i got food poisoning. Worst birthday dinner ever! DO NOT GO! WHOLE FOODS HAS BETTER SUSHI EVEN. THIS IS A CHEAP CHINESE PLACE THAT DOeS Not KNOW HOW TO MAKE SUSHI. Each Roll Coming Out Was worse And worse!

Considers horrible employees but she can&#39;t be talking about anyone at Wok n Fire.  The food is always delicious and the service has never been anything less than courteous and efficient.  I didn&#39;t care for a dish, a bit too hot for my liking and my waitress,  Jeana.....  Linda if you&#39;re going to complain about someone at least get your information correct. Was more than happy to take it back and have a new, less spicy dish made for me.  There are always going to be complainers, and you&#39;re never going to please them.  Cudos to all the employees.

It took quite some time for someone to come out and seat us &amp; a couple behind us (it was a Monday evening at 6PM) We sat in the lounge area which is extremely small &amp; we had no space at all. The coconut shrimp was burnt &amp; the whole piece was fried with little shrimp inside. The egg rolls were really good along with the sauces. Our waitress was on top of things which made the experience better. We would have sat in the dining room but would not be able to take advantage of the happy hour.

I have to agree with some reviews here, that you spent a lot of money on the decor and music and NOT really on their food and wait staff:(  
Too bad, I believe in supporting my local businesses, so I hope they are looking into improving soon.

We came here on a Friday night around 8pm so here&#39;s my Pros/Cons of this place...

Pros:
There&#39;s enough parking in the lot area.
We got seated right away for 2
The bathrooms were clean
The decor is Pan Asian modern style, cool looking, dark and trendy
The music of choice sound like you&#39;re in a club fast pace beat
The hostess was nice with a smile-after a long day of work it&#39;s nice to see that.
Our main dishes were pretty big, enough for two to share
The stir fried spinach with garlic was pretty good
The brown rice well cooked

Cons:
-Our wait staff was not so attentive, refill for drinks took a long time and the place wasn&#39;t too busy.
-They didn&#39;t have 3 of the cold sake we wanted available
-They ran out of grilled asparagus, really?
-The wrinkled green beans were ok, but a bit over cooked and one of them didn&#39;t have the ends cut off, ick.
-The Papa&#39;s Choice Spicy Tuna Maki Special-we got 6 small pieces of sushi hardly any tempura flakes and tons of mayo sauce that we couldn&#39;t taste the spicy tuna and we LOVE spicy tuna:(
-Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass was over cooked (tough and salty)
-The chicken pad thai was good, but too much tofu and not enough chicken.

I&#39;ll have to try the other locations like Elmhurst, maybe it&#39;s just this location that needs improvement?  

If I had to compare this with P.F. Changs as a chain restaurant, then Changs is much better Pan Asian (Oak Brook and Schaumburg).

But again, I tried to support my local businesses."

Wife bought a groupon, so we cashed it in a few days ago.  While her food experience was ok, mine was terrible.  We ordered Edamame as a starter, which I would think is pretty hard to screw up.  It was overcooked, and oiled/buttered for some reason.  Grease on edamame is totally uncalled for.. why not just keep it simple?  We also ordered the pot stickers for my daughter. They were edible, but very dry and bland.  I ordered the seared &#34;Ahi tuna&#34;, which was probably the worst I&#39;ve ever tasted.  It was overdone, and therefore more like tuna steak than Ahi.  I could have lived with that, but there were also large areas of tendon or something, indicating a very cheap cut of fish.  My dish came with fried rice which wasn&#39;t bad, and steamed broccoli.  My wife had kung pow shrimp which she liked.

Service - our server was slow and clueless. The manager came by regarding my tuna, and ended up taking it off the bill, but didn&#39;t apologize or show particular concern. Won&#39;t be going back by choice any time soon."

But the aromas made the restaurant smell less of a buffet cafeteria and more like some good food was being prepared in the kitchen. Per recommendation from one of my friends, I ordered Schezuan tilapia. Served with brown rice, spinach, and in a Schezuan sauce with red peppers, onions, broccoli, and mushrooms, lunch had a wow factor that left me weak in the knees. Because it was lunch and it was quick, I didn&#39;t get around to sampling more from the menu. I shall have to return and perhaps I&#39;ll be able to give at least 4 stars.

We walked in and the scenery and atmosphere were very pleasant. The asian feel was welcoming and we were soon taken to our seats. After about 15-20 minutes our waiter asked us what we wanted. We ordered and while the place wasn&#39;t very crowded we still had to wait 45-50 minutes for our meal. 
The food itself was quite good however. My main course was shrimp fried rice. The shrimp was well cooked and soft, not very crunchy which does depend on taste. The rice was good but it wasn&#39;t any better than your average rice. I also tried of tea which I don&#39;t recall the name(I just took a taste of a family member&#39;s) and it was perfect. I only take the one star off for the long wait but this place is defintley worth your time."

We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which were outstanding except for the fact that they gave us a huge chunk of iceberg lettuce that could not be pulled apart for wraps.  We ate the filling without the wrap, but man that filling was good.

For my entree, I ordered the kung pao noodles with chicken.  There were a generous amount of peanuts, noodles and spice, but they seemed to skimp on the veggies and chicken.  Not the best dish I&#39;ve ever eaten by a long shot.

I&#39;ve heard good things about the sushi here, and I think I&#39;ll come back sometime to try it.  

The prices here are average, and I&#39;ve had better food for less.  Still, I&#39;d go here again if I were in the mood for Asian, and in Addison."

I&#39;ve been to this location a few times, usually with or after a bunch of cocktails, and never really noticed the service too much before.  I know we have definitely waited on food before, but this last time we went it was TERRIBLE.  

It was a weekend evening and not too busy, no wait.  We had asked for a booth (we&#39;re booth snobs) but none were open so we decided just to sit at the bar.  We sat at the bar for about 2 or 3 minutes, never being greeted, and not having a menu or drink menu to look at.  Finally the server/bartender came up and asked what we wanted to drink- and we asked for a drink menu.  After more than enough time to figure out what we wanted to drink, it appeared that our server had no time or attention for us.  The host was walking by and we asked if a booth had opened up yet.... SUCCESS!! We walked away from the bar, without the bartender even noticing.  

As soon as we were seated a server came up, gave us a new drink menu, and we asked for a minute to look it over.  Two different drink menus? Ok.  We decided on our drinks and waited.  Waited.  Finally she showed up, and I ordered and then I waited, and waited.  Finally got our drink and she disappeared before we could order.  Eventually we flagged her down and ordered.  Now... let me tell you... I love sushi, but I LOVE LOVE super white tuna, which they have at wok n fire.  Normally when I&#39;ve gone to sushi places, the nigiri comes out first.  Well we waited, and waited, and a couple rolls on one plate came out. 
These weren&#39;t specialty rolls and they were falling apart.  Not a lot of flavor.  Like, soak them in soy and wasabi to get flavor, no flavor.  Meh.  The next plate were our specialty rolls.  MUCH better.  Not falling apart and full of flavor. What my boyfriend noticed- those rolls had come from the sushi bar up front, the other rolls from the back kitchen.  Things that make you go hm.  
At this point, our server comes up and says oh you need your tuna! Don&#39;t think I forgot little lady- thats the ONLY thing I want right now.  So I do that thing I did earlier... WAIT.  Finally we get down to the last couple pieces of sushi and I tell my boyfriend to find her.  We flag her down, she has no idea why of course, and we tell her we don&#39;t want it anymore.  No apology for forgetting, no nothing.  Just an OK.  We had asked for the bill too but apparently she forgot that as well.  

That was fine because my (sometimes )ever so observant boyfriend noticed people showing their phone to their servers.  He said, QUICK LOOK UP A GROUPON!  I had found the half off groupon which was nice but we had still talked about speaking with a manager.. of course we never did.. and now I&#39;m takin it to the streets.  The streets of Yelp.  


After I had posted my annoyance on facebook, a few others chimed in about the terrible service here, and my boyfriends family agreed too.  So I will def not be goin back."

I&#39;ve been here several times and each time I have had better service in the bar than in the restaurant.  Also, the ONLY time to go here in my opinion is during the happy hour deal where sushi and drinks are half price.  Otherwise, Wok &#39;n Fire is a little on the pricey side considering the size of the rolls (which are tiny).  I will say that Wok &#39;n Fire offers a decent menu that has a pretty good variety and some of their signature rolls are really good;  The Fantasy roll is one of my favorites, but it has sriracha so enough said, really.  Bottom line:  Go there with your friends after work for sushi and drinks, but skip it for dinner."

I&#39;ve been going here for a couple years now for happy hour specials. I&#39;d say this place is better than most of the sushi in the area and they have a wonderful cocktail menu.

As usual I purchased a groupon and brought a friend to come enjoy diner with me. Let me say the group deal was great because it was 15 for 30 and you can order 3 specialty Maki rolls for 38 dollars. Some Maki rolls can go up for 18 dollars! So we saved almost twenty dollars more by getting that and using the groupon. I also didn&#39;t know they had happy hour on weekdays and all the tradional rolls are half off! I am totally doing that as soon as the weather clears up a bit! Anyway the atmosphere was really nice it had a modern Asian feel and the wooden tables were sheek and clean. We ordered the St. Charles roll which were almost completely fired rolls with I believe crab meat and a spicy mustard sauce. I didn&#39;t like them so much it tasted fine but the texture was a no-no for me. My friend adored them however. Next was my our favorite the inky green. It was absoultely amazing, on par with one of the best pieces of sushi I have ever eaten. It was a sushi rolled with avacado and topped with a lightly grilled scallop. I&#39;ve had scallops before but never likes this. It was not chewy at all but almost melted in your mouth and there was a slight crunch to it because of the tempura bits on it so it wasn&#39;t to soft or to crunch. Such an experience. Lastly we ordered the Scorpion which I was dissapointed on because they said the pieces were huge, were they were just more slices of the roll, it wasn&#39;t too bad or too good just as we called it &#34;filler&#34; sushi. Overall though I had a wonderful time at Wok&#39;n Fire with it&#39;s classy atmosphere, cheap prices and great sushi!"

The menu has evolved over time, I used to like it better when there was more Thai choices.  Sushi is ok, and the sashimi cuts are decent.  Service is a bit slow, but usually it is crowded so it comes with the territory.  Food has always been fresh and good."

The food is good - but slightly overpriced, which is typically a huge turn off for me. Not that I have a problem paying for good food...I have a problem paying for just decent food.

((Example: Teriyaki Steak for $22.95. If I&#39;m going to pay 23 bucks for a steak, it&#39;s not going to be at Wok &#39;n Fire))

However, the menu is huge. You have the option of a variety of Asian appetizers, soups and salads, noodle dishes, stir-fry dishes and sushi. As a non-seafood eater, I was disappointed to see the limited veggie rolls. Avocado or cucumber doesn&#39;t really cut it for me. ((boo)). Most recently I gorged myself in a tasty bowl of miso soup and the Chap Chae noodles ((udon noodles with veggies, tofu, and a soy sesame sauce)). Both dishes were good, although the noodles were a little too saucy for my liking. My girl friend had the crab rangoon and the Sesame Chicken. I&#39;ve had the sesame chicken in the past, and I will say, it&#39;s pretty darn good! I&#39;m also a big fan of the Vegetable Egg Rolls.

Service lacked some. Our waitress wasn&#39;t very attentive, and lacked a little friendliness. Not that I expect to be catered to ((well, some - that&#39;s what gratuity is for!)), but I don&#39;t like having to hunt someone down to have my water refilled or grab the check.

I dig the atmosphere. I love the Asian bistro feel with the contemporary and trendy decor. The restaurant is fairly small, so I can see it getting quite packed during peak dining times.

Overall, my experiences have lacked a little something. The food is good, but for the prices I much prefer a Yu&#39;s Mandarin or P.F. Changs. I&#39;m just glad my party had a Groupon...it made the experience ((and check)) a little bit lighter."

I opened the little red book they have and in there I noticed that lady&#39;s night is Wednesday and it ends at 9. Well it took the waitress 20 minutes to come to out table and we asked her at 9:02 if we can do the lady&#39;s night special. She told us that the computer systems don&#39;t allow to adjust the prices. Bs!!!!! I&#39;m not dumb! She then calls the manager on duty and the manager comes over to tell us that there was a misunderstanding about the lady&#39;s night special and she can&#39;t do it. First of all if you are a manager introduce yourself first!!! And we were here before the special ended it just took the slow waitress a while to come over.

The place wasn&#39;t busy and we were seated right away. Layout of this house is split in to two parts. The main and larger area is the dinning room with an array of booths and free-standing tables. Adjacent to dinning room is a long bar where they serve a full range of beers and mixed drinks. There&#39;s also a huge wine rack to the side of the bar, although we didn&#39;t sample it.

After practicing and acquiring enough courage with the chop sticks, I ordered the Szechwan beef, requesting the beef to be cooked well-done. While meal was being cooked, we ordered Sapporo sake, which my co-workers loved, but didn&#39;t seem anything special to me. Granted, I more prone towards darker ales, so full disclosure on that point. Our bartender was friendly and attentive.

When the meal finally arrived, they didn&#39;t cook the beef quite as well as requested. Granted, it wasn&#39;t raw either, but when you put in a request for &#34;well done&#34;, that&#39;s the expectation when your plate arrives. The dish was tasty, although not very large given the price they charge for it. 

Overall, our entourage enjoyed our time at W n&#39; F. It would be welcome for them to give larger serving sizes or drop the price a bit, plus be attentive to how guests request their meat to be cooked. Nonetheless, the staff was friendly and mood for the place is like a quiet nightclub, which makes for a pleasant although not exceptional dining experience."

Boo. Let&#39;s start with entree prices. The prices here are horrendous for what you get. I ordered the kung pao chicken stir-fry, and it was no better than any hole-in-the wall place around here. Here&#39;s the catch, the modestly sized plate was priced at 13 bucks. If you want the stir-fry, please visit Mapo Restaurant down on Naperville for bigger portions that you can share family style, and much better food.

For drinks we had the Morimoto Soba Ale (a brew by Rogue), which was surprisingly good with plenty of hops. In addition we also had a bottle of Haiku Tokubetsu Junmai, which is definitely one of the safer sakes on the menu. The drink menu pushes the TYKU Junmai (with a half-page of bs tasting notes) for $80. If you want sake take that $80, go up to Mitsuwa Supermarket up in Schaumburg, and buy a Kubota Hekiju.

The food was pretty bad as well. the spring rolls skins were under-steamed
resulting in a unpleasant taste. My main course was boring, and served with undercooked rice. I know people enjoy the decor of the place, and that can be one reason why it was packed, but I wonder: does the general public actually know the difference between good and bad food? Or does Marketing determine everything?

I thought I was gracious, 2 stars.

ps. I always see comments on yelp exclaiming the freshness of the fish. I&#39;m not sure how reviewers can actually ascertain the freshness of the fish when it is hacked into pieces and stuff into a roll with _______ (fill in favorite roll ingredients here) and ______ (fill in favorite spicy mayo sauce here). Please, one look at their fish cabinets and I can tell you that the fish is not very fresh at all."

We all were VERY impressed with the food and the service.  The only problem was one of us got extremely sick the next day.  I&#39;m sure it was a fluke but it will keep us from going back as soon as we had discussed when there.  Just bad luck because the food was very good.  We all did Wok but the Sushi looked surprisingly good.

I normally pass because I bring my lunch but I have had lunch delivered from Wok &#39;n Fire for the second time today (i&#39;m actually eating right now). 

On my first try, I had some crispy chicken with this mango sauce. it was okay. At first, I was super hungry so I dug into it. About 20 minutes later, I went back to it and didn&#39;t like my food as much. It could have been because I was actually hungry the first time but I thought that the chicken was dry. 

Today, I have the Teriyaki Chicken and I love it! Perfect grilled chicken with vegetables and rice! The only thing I would suggest  is to not use all the sauce that is given. I actually used to much but thats okay.

I think I have found my once a week lunch take out...on Thursdays of course!"

The bartender was nice and was quick to get my drink and miso. Also, he let me order the sushi lunch special even though it was just past the time frame.

The miso was good, though it had too much chunk to it for my preferences. The sushi was just OK. The maki rolls I ordered were terrible!. There was no flavor, barely any fish and overkilled with mushy rice. Seriously, the worst maki I have ever had. 

Not worth the cost.

The meat and service are excellent. So when we were in the area and saw this spot I was hesitant. But we were hungry and didn&#39;t want to drive far so we picked this place. 

Service was definitely not on par with Chama. At Chama before you even take a seat they pull your chair out and get you ready for your experience. This place was more causal and not as attentive but I didn&#39;t mind it al all. In fact it was a plus in my opinion.

The salad bar was decent the food was good. Again not on Chama&#39;s level of excellence but it was above average. The meats were also very good and above average. And the meat kept coming. It was delicious. My favorite was the Picanha and the bacon wrapped chicken. 

The only thing I was disappointed in was the bread. It wasn&#39;t as good as Chama&#39;s bread. It was hard and  not as tasty. That may have been because we got there an hour or so before closing. Who knows.

Overall for 2 people we spent about a hundred dollars including a drink which was not bad At all. Food was good. Service was friendly and for the price it was a good deal. We will definitely be back."

I loved the salad bar here! So many delicious options. And just as much delicious meat. The garlic steak was on point!! As soon as I left I told my bf we have to come back!!

A little deceiving since it&#39;s inside a strip mall but has a dark, classy interior with some very comfortable seats. So comfortable that we noticed. A full menu of specialty cocktails and all can be made non-alcoholic which is awesome! The pomegranate tini was fantastic even sans etoh. The decent sized salad bar was full of fancy veg options.

Brazilian sausages, chicken, steak, flank steak, Sirloin, filet mignon.. my mouth waters just thinking about it! The drinks were good,  and the bread rolls were like nothing I&#39;ve had before.

Lunch is only available on Fridays and in my opinion, such a steal.  If you&#39;re a true meat fanatic or know someone who really appreciates great steaks, then you have to try this place!  I was really expecting service to lack in comparison to Texas de Brazil and Fogo, but we were immediately greeted by an employee who clearly knows his food and wine.  The man was even able to up-sale a bottle of wine to us, which never happens to me.  

Spectacular lunch for $23 a person with all the main cuts, my favorite definitely garlic steak and flank steak.  I really can&#39;t think of  a complaint other than my dining partner stated he ate too much meat.  Pfft...lightweight. 

Hint: Ask for the trio sauce of horseradish, chimichurri and hot sauce to enhance the meat flavor."

All the meats, side plates, and salad bar is very similar to the big popular steak houses everyone is normally going to. One big difference is the ambiance, it is located in a small building located in a strip mall so you don&#39;t get that same fancy, dark feeling like in those bigger restaurants.  

Service was amazing and begun before we even walked inside.  They have clear windows so we were spotted before we made it to the front.  A really nice lady greeted us by opening the door for us showed us to our party.  Same lady even handed us our plates when we went to the salad bar.  

Only went here once but I had a really good experience all the way around.

They have the popular cheese balls out the oven as soon as you seat at the table. And with the same system of &#34; green card&#34; and they will bring you meat non stop. About 10 variety of cuts including sirloin, filet, sausage, chicken . Enough to make your tummy very happy and put you to a meat coma.

Pros: Great customer service; you will not leave this place hungry;

Cons: I would give them 5 stars if not $$$. They are obviously cheaper than Texas de Brazil, but still pretty pricey. They also do not serve lamb (at least on the night we were there).

Details: 
We came for dinner (which might be one of the reasons for a high price). It was a windy and cold night. Even before we reached the restaurant, one of the waiters spotted us and open the door welcoming us inside - what a nice start to our dinner!!!

The place itself is ok. Nothing outstanding or unpleasant.

Bread, salads, soups and meat dishes were delicious. I tried to minimize my salads consumption to maximize capacity for meat, but could not skip a good lentil soup :).

The staff was very friendly, always there when we needed them with the skewer of deliciously cooked meat.

Overall, it was a great first time experience. My fiance and I definitely enjoyed the dinner."

Tucked away in a nondescript strip mall full of salons, greeting card stores, and dry cleaners I wasn&#39;t sure this seemed like a good bet for a dining experience as unique as a Brazilian steakhouse.  

But trust in Yelp (and my wife&#39;s selection) I did and everyone enjoyed the food.  To be brief here&#39;s how I would compare it to the more common &#39;Texas De Chao&#39; chains.  For a lower cost you get a similar experience, still more meat than any human should consume in a month, and a good salad bar.  The main difference is that the &#34;green means go&#34; card is one-per table and not per diner like most places.  So with a larger group you sort of need to coordinate your meat requests otherwise prepare to either be politely turning away the waiters or watching your plate pile up with food.

The salad bar hits that middle ground of a good selection that wet an appetite but not so much that you make the dreaded mistake of filling up on it before going green.  There were enough individual items that I liked enough to get a small second helping of, but a few items (like the beets) where not all that good.  When compared to some other places I&#39;ve wanted to eat at the salad bar alone and forgo the meat, they&#39;ve been that good.  Here the meat is the central focus (as it should be).

Overall most of the steak was seasoned heavily, but still good.  I&#39;d have preferred a little less salt on some of the cuts.  The Parmesan encrusted pork was actually my favorite, second to possibly the grilled pineapple.  While steak is low on my personal preference scale I still enjoyed nearly every selection.

BTW they have multiple TVs in the restaurant so while we were dining out on a Sunday for a combined birthday gathering my father was still able to watch the Bears game."

The atmosphere was nice, and it was right before christmas, so a lot of families were there. We started with the caipirinha (buy 1 get one half off on Wed), and the cheesy bread starter. So good!
The salad bar was so-so. I liked the cheeses but other than that, nothing too specials. But that was okay since I had room to stuff my face with meat!
I loved their Prime Sirloin, Flié Mignon and Top Sirloin! Their sweet pineapple was a good palate cleanser when I was resting in between the service. 
They did not come out with the meats as often, but if you requested a certain type of meat, they were happy to bring it out.

We came on a slow Tuesday night and has the best experience of Brazilian steakhouse. The salad bar was amazing. Good selection of appetizers, greens, salads and cooked meat. They even have beef stroganoff, Italian meatballs, red wine mushroom, beans, rice and two kinds of soup. I tried the meatballs, broccoli cheddar soup and they tasted fresh. 
When you start the official meal with endless meat, they give you mashed potatoes, grilled banana and cheese balls. I love the cheese balls. 
We had so much meat and my favorite is top sirloin and skirt steak. Oh and the grilled pineapples were delicious!!!

Well, I noticed it on Yelp and the reviews were impressive, so we gave it a shot on a Saturday evening.  We arrived around 5:30pm with our 7-year-old son.  The restaurant was about a 1/4 filled with patrons.  We sat down and were pleasantly greeted by various staff members.  We had to ask the price because we really had no idea what it was and there are no menus due to the nature of the dining experience, but we needed to ask because it was not listed anywhere.  They offered several bottles of wine half-off and good ones at that!  We ordered a bottle of Terrazes Malbec for $22...nice!  And so our feast began...

First we started at the salad bar, definitely not as large of a selection as some of the other places..i.e. Texas de Brazil, however, it was a lovely selection and very delicious.  And guess what?  The price is nearly half less than those other places...I personally don&#39;t need that huge of a selection, because I simply can&#39;t eat all that anyway.  I am a quality over quantity kind a girl.  They also give each table mashed potatoes (meh) and the traditional Brazilian bananas...yumm..  and a basket of cheese rolls, I didn&#39;t have these, but my husband and son loved them.

Okay now my husbands favorite part, the meat!  It was all delicious!  My only complaint is they do not describe what they are serving you.  Do not underestimate the chicken leg!! Omg, this was amazing!! I passed it up, because &#34;I never choose chicken legs&#34;.  Well after I took a bite of my husbands, I flipped our sign to green (this means you are ready for more food) and asked for the chicken leg...this was so darn good, crispy skin with flavorful tender meat underneath...awesome.  Also don&#39;t pass up the grilled pineapple, it was a perfect refreshing palate cleanser.

All in all we had a blast dining here and our son had never eaten so much food at a restaurant, we all loved it and we will be back.  Our son was around $16 and adults around $35 ea.  It was well worth it and very fairly priced...and $22 for a bottle of wine...sold!  By the time we left, this place was packed and I understand why.  Come enjoy a bustling and casual environment, very friendly staff, with fresh salad bar and fantastic meats, and a bottle of wine :-)"

I have been to numerous Brazilian steak houses before, so I knew basically what to expect, but this was decidedly a cut above others I have visited that have more of a &#34;high school lunchroom&#34; type of approach to service. Many Mongolian BBQ places suffer from the same fate. 

If you have someone in your group of friends that is vegetarian/vegan (particularly those of the political persuasion), you might not want to bring them along when you visit this restaurant, or any Brazilian steakhouse for that matter. Sides and accompaniments are always a mere side show in these places, with the meat taking center stage. If the Adkins diet were to ever make a serious comeback, places like this would be ground zero for the revolution. 

This place does have a salad/accompaniment bar that looks fresh and appetizing, but if you are really interested in this, what the hell are you doing in a Brazilian steakhouse? Bring on the artery clogging meat right? Though to be fair, the homemade mashed potatoes were pretty damn fantastic and a great compliment. 

You basically have people that are walking around on a nearly constant basis to slice you off portions of filet, sirloin, pork, chicken, sausage, etc. You have a green sign that you raise up almost like you are at an auction to signify that you are ready for more succulent yumminess. Literally every variety I tried was prepared very well and could be easily cut with a fork. If you are a person that is extremely particular about how your steak is prepared ( I am a R to MR guy myself) you are going to have to be willing to compromise a bit. They can sort of accommodate you depending on where they cut it from, but not with the type of precision you would get at a conventional steakhouse. Not a big deal to me personally though, unless they were to give me something that was WD. Go for some of the grilled pineapple with your meat too! The dichotomy of savory and sweet rocks! 

Shockingly, I did not opt for any cocktails or specialty drinks like I typically would in a place I have never been to before. However, considering the amount of dead animal I devoured in one sitting, I do not think that marinating my palate with alcohol was even necessary. Wine might be an option on my next visit perhaps. My server did suggest drinks though, and was quite prompt and on her game, so no complaints there. 

Lastly, price point here is more than fair given what they have to offer. I have been to similar places that were twice the price per person that were not half as good. 

This is one of those situations where I really wish Yelp would allow the use of half stars, as this place deserves 4.5 star billing in my humble opinion. I rarely give 5 star reviews unless I am completely floored by an experience, but this place is flirting dangerously close to that level."

Came here for my dad&#39;s 49th birthday completely unaware that a place like this existed nearby. 

I love the concept of the service &amp; how all the meat comes out completely fresh. 

Granted, we came here on a Tuesday &amp; it wasn&#39;t busy at all so we were very lucky to swipe all the delicious meat!!!! (My fave)! 

The salad bar was really fresh in my opinion, nothing extravagant but fresh, &amp; a good combination with my meat. 

The staff was really friendly &amp; helpful. (Someone even opened the door for us even BEFORE we were close to the entrance! -- therefore, noting their attentiveness to their guests. 

This is my second time having meat served to you right in front of your eyes, the first being in Cancun at an authentic Brazilian restaurant! I&#39;d say the two couldn&#39;t be more or less the same, although this place is much less fancied down, the meat definitely took me back to Cancun. 

Thanks for the service!"

Being in a strip mall you might be wary, but looks are deceiving! The food is wonderful, the service is impeccable and couldn&#39;t be more friendly.  Friday night with a party of 5 girlfriends.  1/2 price bottles of wine and $33/person for delicious fresh bread puff things that taste like air, all you can eat salad bar, fresh veggies, soup, rice, stroganoff, mashed potatoes, fried bananas and meat brought to your table on skewers!  What more could you ask for? Dessert? they have that too for an additional cost.  
We were SO happy throughout the entire meal and kept commenting how wonderful everything was.  Our server, Adriana, was exceptional.  All the gouchos were extremely attentive and friendly.  We were one of three tables left in the restaurant at closing and they never made us feel as if we were being rushed out.  As a matter of a fact, they refilled our waters since we were still talking.
I HIGHLY recommend taking a chance on this suburban, strip mall churrascaria!"

I do not usually eat meat, at least red meat, but Brazil Express does it right. The Gauchos got to know me and brought me more medium well cuts of meat, I really appreciated that touch. My husband enjoyed everything, particularly the garlic steak. I liked the filet the best, and we both pick the pichana second. This trip I flagged down the grilled pineapple gaucho a few times. The sweet pineapple went so well with the red meat. Yum. I also took some peppers off the salad bar to pair with my flank steak. 
The device was impeccable once again. The owner checked in on is us and even handed me a fresh plate before I could stand up to get it. 
The price has gone up over time, but still more affordable than the chains and way more personal. Check them out for sure, and do it at lunch if you are unsure. You&#39;ll pay less and virtually have all the same meat experience."

They have a broad selection at the salad bar, we tried a mix of the greens, rice, beans and they also had a lot of veggies. When you are ready for the meat to come out you just stick the paper into this holder. Once you do that,  they bring out a dish of mashed potatoes and plantains. I really enjoyed the plantains, I must of had 3 servings of them. The potatoes were bland. As for the meat, this is a smaller establishment so they don&#39;t have as broad of a selection when it comes to the different cuts but the items that we did try were very flavorful and cooked perfectly. My favorite was the carne asada (skirt steak), it would just melt in your mouth! They also serve grilled pineapple wish was just okay, I&#39;ve had better.

I know it&#39;s in a weird location, but get past that and you&#39;ll be in for a treat. 

Similar concepts to other Brazilian steakhouses. One main difference is they have the green &#34;GIVE ME MEAT&#34; card for the table, opposite of other places that have green cards for each person at the table. 

The salad bar has everything you&#39;d want. Very nice, included in the meal&#39;s price and not a separate charge like some other places. They also have really good soups; I enjoyed a taste of the broccoli cheddar courtesy of my wife. There were also sliced meats like salami and cheese. 

The meat was very tasty and flavorful. The best IMO were the top sirloin and the garlic steak. As always with places like this, the rarer the better. Once you start going past even medium rare, you lose A LOT of flavor. The flank steak and the bacon wrapped chicken were yummy too. Of course, I couldn&#39;t stop eating the plantains and mashed potatoes. Addicting!

I have family in Schaumburg and we hope to make this a staple now. Great find! Great job by the entire staff. One minor complaint: the sauces were not brought out/introduced to us until almost 10 minutes into our meat eating part of the dinner. So I thought that should have been brought out even before the meat, just to show and explain. If you go, make sure you ask/get the sauce ASAP. The chimichurri was delicious!"

I also tried one of their Brazilian rum drinks with passion fruit, it was wonderful mix, you can taste the passion fruit while you sip it and have a slight rum after taste without the burn.


They have many great meats, garlic steak, chicken bacon, filet mignon, flank steak, chicken drum sticks, parmesan pork chop, and much more

The first thing that excited me was that this place is a lot more affordable than some of the other Brazilian steakhouses that I&#39;m familiar with. It was about $33 per person after tax and tip.

Brazil Express offers a plentiful salad bar and I really was amazed at how wide of a selection they had. From salads, to salami and cheese, to soup-- they really had it all. I tried to refrain from filling up on too much salad bar though because the meat is the star of the show. The meat itself was really tender and flavorful. Everything was seasoned to perfection. I am totally a &#39;medium&#39; girl though. I felt that a lot of what they were bringing was too pink for my likings. However, I still ended up getting quite a bit of meat and really enjoyed everything I tried. And they have grilled pineapple! om nom nom nom. My favorite non-meat related item was definitely the mashed potatoes they brought to the table. They were so creamy and cheesy!

Our server was really friendly and made sure to explain how everything works and was available for any questions that we had. 

Compared with my other Brazilian experience, I would say that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best Brazillian place out there. HOWEVER, if you&#39;re too cheap for the $50-60 ones, definitely make a pit stop here and see how you like it!"

The only thing the big Steakhouses have over this restaurant is shear size and staff.  But, this great restaurant had the same wonderful attentive staff that we are used to.  The meats were great and the salad bar had everything we wanted.

I must say that this restaurant was equally amazing to their attentiveness and quality of food and drinks as if you were visiting a restaurant in Rio.   Their Capirinhas were delicious (each one freshly made to order), their pao do queijo (cheese balls) could not stop eating them and were as exquisite as the ones I tried in Uro Prieto.  Food - yes their salad bar (super clean) is small but let&#39;s face it, you don&#39;t visit a Brazilian steakhouse for their salad bar.. Lol!! Meat - delicious, tender, and very flavorful just like the churrasqueria in Copacabana. You are able to choose how you like your meat (rare/well done). Overall their price was excellent for the quality of food they provide, it&#39;s absolutely a steal!!! They have drink specials too... Amazing!! Their staff for the most part are Brazilian which gives it a sense of true ownership. Everyone overall was very attentive and cordial and I can&#39;t wait to dine their again. Can&#39;t rave enough about this excellent restaurant without its pretentiousness like other Brazilian steakhouses.   Happy eating yelpers!!!"

Went for my birthday and alerted them I read the yelp page. Even so I don&#39;t think anyone else in the half full restaurant received any better or worse service.

The meats are slightly less salted than the competition. I liked that but on a slightly less salted piece of meat I used a little and solved that problem. The flank steak probably was my favorite medium rare.

Plenty of choices for drinks but this time I just had water which was great with lemons. 

I mentioned my birthday on the phone and they brought us a beautiful ice cream Sunday. Just... The icing on the cake.

I&#39;m actually really concerned about some of these reviews that had me minority concerned . I don&#39;t know what people are expecting. Certainly not my experience. Maybe if this place was squeezed full things might be slower but with all the staff present and so attentive I just don&#39;t see it.

To cover a few of the complaints I read here the potatoes are made in the condition from...shock...potatoes. The giant lumps of slightly unmashed potato should tell you that. The creaminess because of the copious milk and butter. 

I didn&#39;t expect any front loading the meats with cheaper product. In fact the servers seemed (I somewhat joke here) that they couldn&#39;t give us more food. The meats were being rotated out constantly. All tasted high quality and certainly as good as the other Brazilian restaurants I&#39;ve been too.

No issues with check having tip pre-added.

So to end:

Do yourself a favor and have a great dining experience with a hard working crew &amp; a locally owned business. Seriously this place was worth it just for the Pineapple which cooked Brazilian style was to die for.

The only comment I have is again about your pineapple. This is THE thing that differentiates you from your competition. Embrace it because it&#39;s incredible. I&#39;m not sure if you have a desert you use it in but consider that too. I let a piece cool down and 15 minutes later when it was cold it was even better! 

Thank you very much for making my day very special.

Five stars!"

The inside is not bad though.

I came here with a group of 7 on a Saturday night at 6pm. I called ahead around 4pm to make reservations and boy I am glad I did! This place was hoppin! There weren&#39;t very many tables and the place is pretty small- it&#39;s not the best place to walk through the aisles comfortably without almost running into one of the meat servers. 

We started with the salad bar. It looked good, but wasn&#39;t good at all. I tried the mozzarella cheese and almost spat it back out. The asparagus did not taste good. The broccolli cheese soup was possibly the worst I&#39;ve ever had. The potato soup was super salty. Fogo De Chao&#39;s salad bar is waaaaaay better. 

Anyway, there&#39;s a green card on your table and you put it up in a place card holder if you want meat. If you don&#39;t want meat anymore, you take it down. At Fogo De Chao, when we put our green card up, we literally get swarmed and have to immediately put the red side up. Here, when we put the green card up, we could have had it up for 15 minutes and only a few meat servers would come to us. I saw a ton of them walk right past our table with a full skewer of meat. We were all waiting for the grilled pineapple and I had to request someone to send that guy to us. I didn&#39;t appreciate the lack of attention. Other than that, the servers that walked around were really friendly.

As for the meat, it was okay. Nothing special. I&#39;m just not a big fan of brazilian steakhouses in general- my favorite part is usually the unlimited caramelized bananas and mashed potatoes that they give you on your table... which was my favorite part of this whole meal last night. Lol, not worth the brazilian steakhouse price.

We also got the brazilian special dessert- it was ok, it was like banana bread with a bunch of other stuff in it. We also got a free ice cream for my hubby&#39;s birthday, which was a nice touch.

Our total bill was $360. We were handed our check back after we put cash in it- the server said he wanted to make sure we knew that gratuity was already added to the bill, which on one hand was nice of him, but on the other, as a server, you should tell the customer it was already included or circle it on the bill when you hand the customer the check. 

Overall, it was a nice experience. It was $33/person for unlimited salad bar and steak service. Fogo De Chao is $48.50 and my hubby said he&#39;d rather go there for brazilian steakhouse services. But like I said, I&#39;m not a huge fan of them in general, but if you are, then this place would be a more reasonable priced place than Fogo and the other more expensive ones!"

For starters, the salad bar was atrocious.  Their &#34;meatballs&#34; taste like dog food and the food on the salad bar was definitely sub-par.

For their meat, again, I expected less than Texas but for the most part quality was similar, maybe a tad below.

The single greatest thing about this restaurant was the grilled pineapple.  I ate more of that than I did anything else.

Overall, I would rather spend an extra $10/per person and go to an establishment that has a better ambiance."

The service is outstanding as the owner is always in house and I always feel pampered there.

If you like meat all over and in your body too, this is the place for you!

Granted, it&#39;s no Chauma Gaucha. I found myself passing up seconds of some of the meats I tasted, which would never happen with me at CG; however, the attentive servers had no qualms about me asking for a double dose of the picanha (prime sirloin) each time they made the rounds. I also really enjoyed the bacon wrapped filet mignon and top sirloin. I liked the sausage but wasn&#39;t impressed by the chicken and didn&#39;t happen to see the garlic steak that is listed on their website.

Their salad bar had a lot of options, but nothing really spoke to me. Again, I prefer the offerings at Chauma Gaucha. Luckily, I wasn&#39;t let down by the sides they served. As far as I could tell, the cheese bread and fried bananas taste exactly the same. The potatoes weren&#39;t as good, but they weren&#39;t bad. And really, I&#39;m all about the cheese bread and bananas, so I was in banana/bread heaven.

While their selection might be second best for me, the price point is tops! At most Brazilian steakhouses it&#39;s about $25 for lunch during weekdays and then anywhere from $40-60pp for dinner and there usually isn&#39;t a big difference between what is offered during the day and during the evening. Here there are a few items that they bring out at night, but lunch (offered Thurs &amp; Fri) is only $18 and dinner is always $27. That&#39;s much more convenient and justifies me filling that monetary gap with booze.

I ordered a pitcher of red sangria for our party of 3. It&#39;s much more economical than buying single drinks, so I highly recommend going the communal route. We each got 2 glasses out of it. It was a little heavy on the ice. Perhaps you can request for them to hold back a bit.

What you shouldn&#39;t hold back on is the flan. It is fan-fucking-tastic! Easily the best flan I&#39;ve ever had anywhere, and the portion size was huge. I ended up taking half of it home and could have easily split it with a friend; however, then I&#39;d have had to split it and wouldn&#39;t have had as much. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s something I&#39;m willing to do."

First we ordered drinks. I ordered the Brazilian specialty drink, (can&#39;t remember how to spell the name of it) in passion fruit flavor. The drink I got was NOT passion fruit. It was guava. The same guava I buy from the market. Also it was loaded with limes. This was made in a small glass that probably only held 6 oz. At Texas de Brazil its at least made in a highball glass. 

Their salad bar selection was lackluster to me and not interesting nor were there many options. The meat tasted good. 

We originally chose this place because it was cheaper than Texas de Brazil. However, we were charged an automatic gratuity even though our party was only 5 people...so it ended up being the same price. I usually always tip, but it was off putting that they just included it, especially since we saw our waitress once. 

Anyway I enjoyed seeing my friends and eating meat before we went to the Mid in Chicago for a Kill Paris DJ set."

I&#39;ve been to many other similar restaurants (Fogo, Texas de Brazil, etc.) and while they can be better in regards to variety of meats and salad bar items, Brazil Express usually costs half as much and has 80% of what I love from the other places.  I&#39;ve been coming here since the restaurant opened and the quality has only gone up over the years.  Service is always top notch and I have never left disappointed, I&#39;ve come here to celebrate intimate dinners for two and big parties of 12+ and everyone has always had a great time.  

As others have probably described, this restaurant is all-you-can-eat.  You start off with the salad bar which has some veggies, meats, cheeses, soups, and a couple various hot items.  They bring mashed potatoes, fried plantains and (my favorite) cheese-filled bread balls to your table.  You have a card that is green on one side and red on the other, as long as your card is green then they will bring meat to your table!  The meat is grilled on long metal rods and they will slice of however much you like onto your plate.  Some items such as the sausage and chicken will just be put directly on your plate without need for slicing.  Feel free to ask for multiple of the items you like, and don&#39;t forget to use the chimichurri sauce!  If you&#39;ve managed to leave room for dessert, they have a fabulous selection of pies and cakes as well.

Again I highly recommend Brazil Express and hope they stay in the neighborhood forever.  Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants around."

Even though the service was impeccable and they even hold the door open for you to walk in and out, there were a few disappointments. The cheese rolls were cold (but good), the chicken legs and bacon-wrapped chicken were tasteless and dry, and the garlic mashed potatoes were bland. The fried bananas were soggy and stringy. On the positive side, the steak items were delectable and tender. I especially liked the garlic steak. The pineapple on a stick was delicious and the salad bar did not disappoint. From the salad bar, I liked the two shrimp salads, the tabbouleh, the fried tilapia, and the Brazilian salsa. My son loved the chicken salad and the apple salad. I just wish they had gotten the sides and the chicken right."

Pretty simple. Well with Brazil Express there were none to be found, delicious food and an equally delicious Salad bar. Let&#39;s start with the Salad bar, it has delicious taboule Salad, various cheeses, soups, and more. I usually put a little from the Salad bar because I come to Brazil Express for the meat. The meats range from steaks, chicken, sausage rolled steaks and even pineapple. Everything is so, so good! I love this place and their service."

I was definitely very full.. ready to explode by the time that i left the restaurant...felt like I had enough food for the week in my stomach.. :)

DO NOT BE FOOLED...after you fill up on your meat, salad bar, and cheese bread...they will come out delicious looking desserts.. yes they are delicious....but guess what...THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED WITH THE MEAL...they cost about $7.50+ depending on what dessert you select... soo.. if you are full already.. I would probably just pass on the tempting dessert.....save your stomach for some froyo a couple hours later to something......but if you&#39;re still hungry &amp; craving dessert.. they taste good.. I tried the creme brulee... tirimisu ..and two other desserts (can&#39;t remember...)

Costs: around $30+ per person ...but if you order dessert.. it&#39;s more....

Parking: plenty of parking... the restaurant is kinda hidden in a small strip mall.. it&#39;s located in the same plaza as the big JEWEL..and also near a SUBWAY and BURGER KING.. :)

Dress code: you probably want to wear loose clothing (for girls...a casual loose dress is perfect!..)..unless you want to unbutton your pants...it&#39;s not a classy restaurant so you don&#39;t need to wear dress clothes.. but you probably don&#39;t want to come here in sweats or scrubs...just casual wear works!..

yes ... i would come here again if i&#39;m craving meat.. you basically get salad bar &amp; lots of meat for probably the same cost that you would pay at a restaurant for just 1 steak or something..YUM to meat"

Starting with the salad bar, they offer a very limited selection. I was surprise to see they did not offer asparagus since it&#39;s in season. The salad bar only has a quarter of the selections they offer at Texas de Brazil. You&#39;re not going to get items like prosciutto, goat cheese, roasted vegetables, fresh mozzarella, couscous or shrimp that the competition offers.

I wasn&#39;t overly impressed with the selections of meats either. Some cuts were overcooked and others were not properly seasoned. It was somewhat disappointing after reading the high marks this establishment scored with other yelpers. Even the ice tea I ordered was so watered-down you could see right through the glass."

Recommended for anyone that really wants to get lots and lots of meat. Not really great for vegetarian options, but why would it be? It&#39;s a brazilian steakhouse.

Two things you&#39;ll lose: a smaller / weaker salad bar (which I think actually helps you from filling up on salad - one place you shouldn&#39;t do that) and also they don&#39;t have bacon wrapped filet.

Otherwise, the meat is incredible and the service is outstanding.  They&#39;re constantly checking on you and anticipating what you need.

Some great desserts and really good capirhinas.

You are seated and given some rolls and told to check out the salad bar. The salad bar was fine but a waste of time because you are in meat heaven and don&#39;t need no sticken veggies.

You are given a green sign to put up if you want them to walk around and give you the meat. Boy oh boy do they give you the meat. All sorts of beef, chicken ,pork and some pineapple. The men with the meat walk around continuously. You definitely get your monies worth. You can even the request the meat you want and they will come over. My favorite was the sirloin and the pineapple. Delicious!!

My husband and I LOVE this place! We have been to a lot of Brazilian style steakhouses, but this one beats them all. The food is always fresh and tastes amazing, the servers and the manager go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied and taken care of, and the prices are very reasonable. 

We used to go to Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao once every couple of months, sometimes every month and a half because the price wouldn&#39;t allow us to go more often. We are both big carnivores so going out to eat usually means a steakhouse.... Now, we visit this place at least once every 2-3 weeks. Their fried bananas are amazing, the grilled pineapple makes my mouth water, and each cut of steak tastes different and is seasoned perfectly. One you tell them how you like it cooked, that is what they will bring to your table throughout the night. Don&#39;t forget to finish off with the sweet and creamy crème brulee. To die for.

I&#39;m so happy we found this gem and get to experience such a great dining experience so often!

We dine on 3/9/15 which happened to be on a Monday for my wife&#39;s birthday.  I noticed that they closed at 9pm and I gave them a call before hand around 7:30 to ensure that they were able to accommodate us.

When we arrived it was 8:10 (we drove from Glenview) there were 3 other tables (1-2 top and 1- 3 top &amp; 1- 4 top)  all of them were talking and chatting and probably wrapped up their meals a while ago.

We were greeted, sat, brought water and everything was fine including the salad bar.  I won&#39;t even bitch about the broccoli soup which was way worse than my corporate cafeteria BECAUSE that isn&#39;t the main reason why we are there.

We&#39;re there to eat meat plain and simple.

We were starving and our server (possible the owner?) asked if we wanted medium well meats or else we would have to wait 7 mins.

I said I&#39;ll try it.  Big mistake.  It was awful.  0 pink in center, edge, anywhere in the meat.  Meat was charred (like sitting in the flame 20 mins too long)  It was like jerky.  Beef, chicken, pork jerky.  It was obviously sitting there from the previous parties and just cooking and drying out.  

I&#39;m not sure where they get off passing these meats off as medium well.  I took a couple of bites and just set it aside.  So did my wife.  The server did ask if there was something wrong and I did tell him it was just too well done for our liking.  He said it would be 7 mins to cook new meats to a medium rare.  

After we waited they brought out new meats.

And guess what.  The meats that we got were super rare to almost raw.  They just charred the outside but when we cut into the meats the meat was raw.  

I didn&#39;t even bother at this point to complain I was so hungry I just ate the raw meat.
And even though I abstain from grains at a brazilian bbq I found myself eating it because I couldn&#39;t stand this flavorless and raw meat.

I have pic of one of meats but I&#39;m not sure how to upload it.  

They could not get their temperature right.  

Also I lol&#39;ed at the pineapple.  It seemed like he literally warmed it over the fire and brought it to my table.  I should&#39;ve known because there was 0 caramelization of the sugars on the pineapple.  

Owner or whoever gave us some flan after our meal because my wife complained.  I think the complaint was falling on deaf ears. I never asked for the flan or any compensation I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  I took two bites of the flan and knew that was wrong too.  Just too dang hard I thought flan was supposed to have some give and be silky and not rock hard.

Well that sucked too so we left with 3/4 of it on the plate.

I didn&#39;t want to take it out on the wait staff so I left an appropriate tip I just plan on never returning there.

From the time we started getting food and by the time we left it was less than 25 mins.  

A big caveat!!!!

**** DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND AVOID THIS PLACE AT LEAST ON THE WEEKDAYS. IF YOU MUST GO..GO ON THE WEEKENDS****"

Basically it is just like the more expensive steak houses, except a few details.

1. This place is about half the price. $27/ person for all-you-can-eat versus $50.

2. This place is much smaller, both space wise and in the variety of food. The salad bar is limited compare to the other places I have been, and it seemed like they did not have as many varieties of meat.

3. Instead of having individual &#39;yes I want more&#39; or &#39;no, not now&#39; meat coins, you have to decide as a table if you are ready for more meats or not. Not a big deal, but I prefer my own.

Other than that, it was basically the same. Same side dishes, same varieties in drinks and desserts, and same concept. And they do have the grilled pineapple here (my favorite!). 

The service was pretty good, maybe not AS good as other places, but not bad. Our server did a good job of explaining how this works, and they were good about refilling drinks. The meat men could have been a little more friendly. If you want more of something, you can ask for it and they will make it. If you want the meat more rare or more well done, you can ask for that as well. I do recommend that you tell them, because they are supposed to ask but they usually don&#39;t. 

Make sure you don&#39;t fill up on the salad bar (which can be easy to do)! Get all your meats in first!

I would come back if I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the normal places!"

It&#39;s a small restaurant, but making reservations for a party of 11 for a Tuesday night was very easy.

It&#39;s all you can eat meat, for about $27/person, which includes their salad bar but not dessert.  Only one person at the table seemed bothered by the non-inclusion of dessert, and as much as I love sweets I was okay without it.  They do serve a grilled banana and grilled pineapple at the table, which is all the sweetness you will have room for anyway.

The service was great, and they were even forward enough to warn us not to fill up on the salad bar.  I really didn&#39;t find anything that intriguing at the salad bar anyway.

My favorite dishes were the chicken wrapped with bacon and the garlic steak.  Flank steak is my favorite, and I usually don&#39;t buy it because it&#39;s so expensive, but Brazil Express&#39; cuts of flank were really unevenly cooked.  One piece I had was really tough with lots of gristle, while the other piece was perfect.

Don&#39;t pass up the sauces - the cilantro sauce and horseradish sauce add a lot of flavor to the steak.

They do serve most of the meat rare to medium rare, but they are happy to put it back on the grill for you.  I only had one piece of steak that was too rare for me to eat, but I left it on my plate since I knew more was coming.  I appreciated that the service was accommodating of everyone&#39;s preferences instead of being condescending jerks preaching about &#34;losing the flavor.&#34;

Don&#39;t pass up the garlic cheese biscuits either.  Oh my goodness.  I saved these until I had my fill of meat.  Honestly, I&#39;m not a big red meat fan, so I didn&#39;t feel like I was missing out on anything by eating a ridiculous amount of biscuits.

Brazil Express is a great place for a night out with a group of friends, to celebrate, or just to gorge on meat."

Salad bar is small though adequate. Service is quick though not hurried. The cheesy bread is awesome, love it! could eat more of those rather than meat, just saying.

But this place makes darn good ones! Came here on a Wednesday night with a large party and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I&#39;m comparing this experience with my only other Brazilian steakhouse experience  at Texas de Brazil, and this place is definitely does not lose edge while maintaining a price point half from its competitors. Downside is that the salad bar is not as fancy.. but come on you&#39;re here for the meat! Servers are really nice and attentive and make sure you get the meats you want.

I first grabbed a plate full from the salad bar, which has a lot of the staple cold vegetables and then we went onto to the meats. I think our table in general tried every piece of meat at least once and got 2-3 more of the ones we liked. Although I did enjoy the steaks, red meat is a bit heavy for me. So I got second portions of the chicken legs (my favorite one). Bread is nice and eggy. Sides came with roasted bananas and mashed potatoes. Apparently you eat the banana in between each meat to clean your palette? (Don&#39;t quote me on that). Dessert was pretty good too. I got the housemade papaya soft serve mix. I would have liked it better if it was a thicker consistency, but the flavor was great.

However, I wouldn&#39;t go anywhere else. 
It&#39;s definitely not the fanciest. It&#39;s definitely the cheapest one price wise. And their salad bar is definitely smaller than average. I know it sounds bad. But they&#39;re amazing! The service is great, the meat is SO AUTHENTIC!  And most of the servers are Brazilian, which is something I appreciate. Whenever I go to a chain Brazilian steak house, they don&#39;t know the name of the cuts in Portuguese and that annoys me. And it just doesn&#39;t taste as good. If I&#39;m eating Brazilian food, I want it made by brazilians and served by them too!
Ask for some farofa when you&#39;re there. As soon as they realize I&#39;m from Brazil, they hook me up with some. It tastes delicious mixed with rice, black beans and Brazilian vinaigrette. 
They&#39;re always so nice there, and I love the cozy atmosphere."

The meat is unbelievably tender even when it&#39;s sirloin and the cheese bread was melt-in-your-mouth perfect.  Even the salad bar was interesting, lots of premium choices like lightly cooked asparagus and these pickled beets that impressed me immensely despite being, well, pickled beets.  Mostly go for the meat though, although the endlessly replenished grilled bananas are also spectacular.

Pricey but worth it."

The salad bar is small and kinda &#34;blah&#34; but, why would you go here for salad?  I have been to all of the big Brazilian steakhouses and they do NOT COMPARE to this place.  As soon as you walk up to the front door, you see a server, manager, whoever is around running to open the door for you.  Everyone has a smile on their face and is extremely accommodating. This place gets very busy between 5-7 so make a reservation or go during off times. The only complaint I have about this place is the box mashed potatoes they give you at the table- they taste like paste, but again, who cares about mashed potatoes when you have perfectly cooked meat making the rounds."

I have frequented many a Brazilian steakhouse in my time! This one is probably at the top of my list! If you go to a steakhouse looking for a good salad bar then go you don&#39;t deserve to be here! It&#39;s about the meat and it is cooked and seasoned to perfection... Do yourself a favor and skip the salad bar and fill up on the flat and house steak! 
Edit- I forgot to mention that the price is so reasonable. So much much less than the larger chains and much cheaper than a steak dinner at any other steak house and you get a variety here!"

First, it&#39;s super noisy now, and we had to sit at a table tucked into the back that wobbled like crazy. The table was fixed by our waiter, but our location meant we were the last to get any dish that came out, meaning all the meats lacked any crust or seasoning because previous diners were served those slices. There were also swaths of time during which we were not served at all.

We had to ask for the sauces and our drinks were not refilled regularly. And when they were, they were filled with the wrong drink.

I was also served a filet that was straight up raw. Not underdone, but raw. It had basically walked past the oven on its way to my plate. Also, the selection of meats and salad bar were quite limited.

Finally, the bill had a mandatory 18 percent gratuity tacked on. We were a party of 2. A bit presumptuous, no?

I loved this place our first visit, but the second visit was our last visit. Too bad!"

This place is a great find in the Schaumburg-land area. The exterior and name does not do this place justice as it&#39;s not an express place to go. This place is perfect for intimate dates to party gatherings as they provide great service and food- definitely a restaurant that allows you to wine and unwind. 

Been here multiple times for both dates with the bae and birthday gatherings and every time I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve left completely over-satisfied. 

The food is delicious, meat cooked perfectly- if you prefer a different cook on the meat don&#39;t be afraid to say so as they love to make you happy. Great ambiance and interior decor. Salad bar is a little lackluster but obviously you&#39;re there for the meat. 

Pricing is good compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses and you definitely get what you pay for. 

I highly recommend the Papaya Cream. I&#39;m not a fan of papaya or cream, but the two together is AH-MAZING."

My friends took me here for my BDay which was very nice of them. I tried a few things at the salad bar but wanted to leave room for the meats. It was like a carousel of meats coming by the table. You could try what you want, cooked how you like, for as long as you want. 

Between the salad bar, meats, fried banana, cheese rolls the was no room for dessert. Which looked awesome too. Maybe next time."

The staff is great and can answer any of your questions but if you&#39;ve ever been to this style of restaurant you don&#39;t need to ask questions: Just turn your card to GREEN and stuff your face. When you need to pace yourself (or at least swallow what you have in your mouth), just turn your card to RED to stop the food-baby-madness. All will begin again when YOU tell them to!!

I understand the price increase but $33? Nope. This place is located in a STRIP MALL and the service isn&#39;t anywhere what it used to be. It&#39;s a pleasure having a place like this in Schaumburg but their prices have quickly outgrown their product. 

We went during a busy holiday lunch and ignored as the couple in the corner while the large families were continually served all the meat.  We actually had to flag down a manger multiple times just to get regular service. No thanks, I&#39;ll pay full price at Fogo de Chao for the real stuff at this point."

Hitting the mark between great food for a great price is an art, and Brazil Express Churrasco Grill hits it straight on the head.

Pulling up to this place in a strip mall is probably about the worst aspect of this restaurant. It looks dull and absolutely uninviting, but trust me, just make it through that door. Inside you&#39;ll find very classy looking tables and great service. 

If you haven&#39;t figured it out yet, this is a Brazilian steak house, which means bring your stretchy pants. You get a fantastic salad bar that includes a few very good appetizers, along with fresh and tasty soup. When you&#39;re ready for your main dish, they bring along mashed potatoes and a fried bananna. The main dish is meat, by the truckloads. Guys in chef outfits come to your table with giants slabs of various meats for you to choose from. You get unlimited meat, let me repeat that, UNLIMITED MEAT!

So imagine my surprise when I arrived hungry and not knowing exactly what a Brazilian steak house really was.I maxed. The meat is absolutely perfectly cooked, I didn&#39;t have a single piece of meat that wasn&#39;t succulent, very nicely seasoned, and cooked to a degree I feel anybody could find acceptable. 

The drinks were also masterfully made, at $9-$10 a drink, I expected nothing less, and was very happy to see they didn&#39;t leave quality out of anything they did. 

This is one of those restuarants that understands spending around $30 a plate a person for most people is not a regular occurence, so when we do drop quite a bit on dinner, we better get every penny worth. At Brazil Express, you do.

Bottom Line:
--------------------------------
Get that penny&#39;s worth."

My wife found Brazil Express Churrasco Grill on Yelp along with a few others in the area but we decided to give this one a try based on the excellent reviews.

When we first pulled up to the strip mall location, we both had second thoughts upon seeing the restaurant from the outside and contemplated going someplace else but decided to give it a try.

For anyone thinking of trying this restaurant - DON&#39;T LET THE OUTSIDE APPEARANCE DETER YOU!!!! 

Our entire experience was first class - outstanding service, wonderful salad bar with excellent, fresh ingredients and a meat selection that rivals the very best steakhouses at a fraction of the price. We were never left wanting for anything and absolutely loved the wide range of selections. My wife had a red sangria that she said was the best she had ever had and we enjoyed the entire experience and could not have been happier."

I have timed it and I can walk to this place from my apartment in right about 5 min. It would literally take me longer to get my car out, drive up to the entrance, wait for the gate to open, and drive over there. So yeah, this place is wicked handy, especially on weekends when I am in the mood to get obliterated and not have to worry about driving. 

The biggest advantage of all at this place is how cheap it is to drink here. You will pay at least double for drinks at almost every other place in this general vicinity than you will here. And wait, it gets better, they have daily specials that are damn near on par with what a college bar charges. Food too, with half price appetizers rocking on Wed! You just can&#39;t beat this place for value, and I for one appreciate the fact that this place does not rape and pillage on pricing like 99% of the other bars around here. 

Another surprising characteristic about this place is how good the food is. I have sampled lots of items off the menu at this point and everything has been delicious for what it is, and, like the alcohol, the prices are cheap! If you are into meatloaf, it is always really good here. I also like the ghost pepper sandwich but the wings are simply outstanding.  

Clientele here are mostly locals to the neighborhood, and after you have been in a few times you will get on a first name basis with several of them. The same goes for the staff who are always genuine and courteous when I show up. 

It&#39;s nice to have a local watering hole to stop in at when I have one of those days at the office that feels like jumping onto a bicycle with the seat missing."

For too long I&#39;ve been without a burger and fries for a few bucks, or darts with fair priced beers. I&#39;ve searched for places to find the familiarities of the college bars I grew up loving, but who would have thought I&#39;d find it in my very own.....neighborhood?

Neighborhood Inn is my new favorite diamond in the rough. It has the cozy feel of a small town bar, and features the distinct atmosphere of a local watering hole. They offer specials on food &amp; drinks every day, and have evidently won awards for their chicken wings (they also have a burger basket deal on Tuesdays...jackpot!) and, of course, have reasonably priced beers. 

I may not kick the door in one day and be greeted by name as I order the usual and strike up a conversation with Sam, but I&#39;d certainly return for a refreshing blast from a relatively recent past. Nothing sounds more appealing than springing for a few cold ones, burgers, and darts.

As for the food, the beer nuggets were ok and cheese fries were ok. Food overall was just 10 bucks.

I am sure if you come here regularly, you will get preferences. They did have a variety of drinks, we started with rum n coke, then had shot of absolute citrus+hazelnut liquor, then had on the rocks chocolate raspberry vodka with hazelnut liqour.

Literally in the middle of a residential area there is a strip mall where you will find Neighorhood. It is your typical late night bar that has live music on occasion and if you grew up in the area chances are you will run into someone you went to high school with. They recently added video poker machines which is disturbing for me personally because the only time I ever think of gambling is when Ive had a few too many to drink. Fortunately I have had someone to restrain me when Ive had my fill and decide it would be a good idea to play a couple hands.

Neighborhood is always an option after all the other bars close if your in the area. The bartenders are always friendly and the beer is always flowing. Check it out on weds or thurs for the open mic night. I cant remember now cause I don&#39;t think ive ever left there sober..."

I used to live in the apartments next door and it was great having a place I could walk to and get trashed at and not have to worry about who&#39;s going to drive us home. I still come here from time to time for the memories and because it&#39;s close. Service is friendly for the most part as long as you&#39;re not acting like a drunk jerk. 

They have karaoke but I can never remember which nights. This dive bar, like many townie dive bars, has it&#39;s collection of regular drunks that sit at the bar but it also has a decent variety of a younger crowd so the girls in your party won&#39;t feel creeped out by the wino with the 1000 mile stare undressing them.

The staff and the crowd is very laid back and midwestern friendly!  This is rare to find such a relaxed bar in the suburbs.

Stick with the large drink special and you&#39;ll have a cheap night.  Shots are their money makers...but a good night always has a couple shots involved.

The bartenders and cocktail servers have been the same staff for over a year now.  All are super friendly and know how to make almost any drink.

I love the crowd here.  If you come with a couple of friends...no one is going to bother you or annoy you.  It&#39;s a great place to make new friends.  Age range of 22-32.  Some older folks come in...but they are looking to have a great time as well.  Again...very laid back bar and worth the trip."

The Hood is a great place to go when you want to escape the bars during MMA fights as they don&#39;t show them there.

The food here is crap though. We had appetizers and they were terrible. I mean, we don&#39;t ask for much. It was like they threw some mush in a frier and a microwave, peed on it, and sent it out. But really, do you go to a Hoffman Estates townie bar to eat? Our bad I guess.

It is kinda dirty, very cramped, and you have to wait in line for the single bathroom stall. But you know what?

I&#39;ve been there on the weekends for karaoke, and you probably won&#39;t find a seat showing up after 10/10:30pm as I&#39;ve experienced everytime I showed up at that time.  It&#39;s funny b/c the Inn is right next to a daycare center---I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s funny to me, but it is..........LOL
I haven&#39;t tried their food, but it didn&#39;t look like anything all that special and I didn&#39;t see many people eating it everytime I went there.  Drink prices are just Ok in my opinion.  Service is pretty good.  Normally there is only one waitress walking around, even when it&#39;s packed.  The waitress does sing karaoke on Sat nights once or twice, but I didn&#39;t notice if that ruined anyone&#39;s service or not........ 
It&#39;s mainly a young crowd in my opinion, as normally I see a mix of ages at places I go to.  I noticed there  tends to be an extra &#34;fiesty&#34; bunch each time I&#39;m there----it&#39;s cool to see everyone have a great time, but sometimes fights did break out, and once I got hit in the face with small pieces of glass and some beer.  The bouncers were very good, however, and we went pretty much right back to having fun!     

As far as the KJ (man running the karaoke), I&#39;ll be honest and say I don&#39;t care for him very much.  His sound system isn&#39;t the greatest, but it&#39;s decent as well as his song selection.  He was alright the first few times, but as we frequented the bar more, I believe I&#39;d see him drink too much, then mess up the rotation.  Once my boyfriend and I were there for 3 hours, an hour after karaoke started, and he only called us each up once while other people were called up 3 times while we were there, not including the hour some were there before us.  After we mentioned it to him, he tried to put both of us up for the first songs on our slips we already sang.  He had never done that before, so I don&#39;t know what was up, but that pretty much pushed us away.  In general, he doesn&#39;t have a great &#34;entertainment personality&#34; as most of the KJ&#39;s I&#39;ve encountered, and I noticed he makes everyone clap each time he calls up a singer---normally where I go, we only clap after they sing, but whatever.  I guess that&#39;s just his way of enthusiasm.  Now at this bar, there are always a lot of singers from my experiences, but I also notice he plays music in between, which he probably shouldn&#39;t do when the place is packed like it usually is. 

I&#39;d like to come here again, but I&#39;m not quite sure about their KJ&#39;s service........"

I&#39;ve got three words for you &#34;Spuds Encased Hash-brown&#34;! What? I&#39;ve never heard of those but apparently Gail has been making these for 20+ years. Just when I think I&#39;ve had every breakfast combination, something amazing like this comes around. 

So let me explain. They make omelets here which seems normal until you get it encased in a perfectly cooked crispy hash-brown. My delicious omelet is being hugged by a potato blanket. I loved it. 

This was the first meal I had for 2014 and I was glad I did. We were staying in a nearby hotel where the free breakfast was well free. We didn&#39;t want to start our year out like that. So we checked Yelp and called around and were lucky enough to find that Gail&#39;s was open. How great was that! Open New Years morning in the middle of a snow storm with unplowed streets. If that isn&#39;t a sign of perfection, then I don&#39;t know what is.  

I called in our order and I was told to give them 30 minutes. When I walked in at 30 minutes our order was sitting on the front counter ready to go. I paid and was on my way. The inside looked nice and cozy. There were a few people eating inside but it was not crowded at all. Hey it was New Years morning, so I&#39;m sure many people were still hanging at home.

These amazing omelets are called Spuds. I ordered the original spud which was bacon, onion &amp; cheese. You can not go wrong with an original. It was really good plus I was having bacon in 2014. Happy New Year to me. I would definitely order this again. I am not usually in this area but it is worth a trip. My wife had the veggie version of the Spud. She really liked it also. The spuds came with a choice of side either toast or pancakes. We went pancakes but were so stuffed we could not even eat them. I know I was stuffed like an encased hash-brown. 

So if you are in the area looking for something that is out of the norm for breakfast, then get in here and try one of Gail&#39;s Spud creations. You will be happy you did. I can&#39;t wait for my next one."

Enter the Spud at Gail&#39;s Carriage House Inn. 

I saw Anthony M&#39;s photo of this potato-wrapped delicacy and knew it had to get in my stomach. So despite another bombardment of Chicago snow (which seems to happen every other day lately), we trekked out early on Sunday morning to eat potatoes and more potatoes. 

Long story short, it was just okay. None of the ingredients were really all that special. It was good, just nothing to write home about, or leave home and travel 30 miles north through crappy Chicago winter conditions for. The omelet was just as good as any pancake house/diner, the hash browns, while crisp, were average, and the diced onions were huge (size of a quarter, doggone!) and I ended up picking out about a handful because it was just too much. 

Our server dropped our food and disappeared, never to be seen or heard from again until bringing the check. I hate that. No refills til I asked for them, and never asked how everything was. Disappointing. 

So would I go back? Yeah. The food was decent, but I wouldn&#39;t drive almost an hour to get there again."

It was a Sunday afternoon, so we anticipated it to be busy like most breakfast places on a Saturday or Sunday morning/afternoon. It was pretty packed, parking was pretty limited, but we were able to get seated at the counters right away. Although the wait for a table wasn&#39;t too bad either it was a 15-20 minute wait, but we were starving so we took the counter seatingm 

The menu was large and everything looked so good. Ended up getting one of their spuds since that seems to be one of their specialties. I got the &#34;Gentleman&#39;s Spud&#34; which was a skirt steak omlette with green peppers, onions, and mushrooms encased in hasbrowns. You also got a choice of toast or pancakes and I got raisin toast (which I never hear as an option at the breakfast places I&#39;ve been to). It was absolutely delicious. I mean you got your potatoes, eggs and meat alongside your bread of choice, what more do you need for breakfast?! My tummy was very satisfied. 

We also got served by one of the owners Gail which I thought was very cool. The fact that the owners are present and serving their customers shows how much they care and are hands on with their business. Even though Gail was serving us, the other servers were still very attentive to us as well asking if we needed more water or a box. This place is a gem, great service, great food, great prices and a  homey feel. I love these small businesses! I will definitely be back to try some more things!"

It&#39;s okay food, but a definite greasy spoon. I thought the pancakes were bisquick at best. My eggs were undercooked, and I suppose I could have asked for them to be cooked longer but I didn&#39;t. 

It&#39;s not a terrible place to have breakfast, but I&#39;m certainly confused as to why it&#39;s rated so highly. It&#39;s only fine. If there&#39;s ever a next time, maybe I&#39;ll try one of their signature dishes."

I get that you&#39;re busy and I really feel for you, but on a Sunday morning it takes a lot to get my hungover ass out of bed. The longer it takes to get my waiter, coffee, sprite, juice, anything!... the more my body dies a little. Help a sister out, geez.

On to the food. 
Biscuits and gravy - 3/5 - Dry biscuits but the gravy is thick, yummy, with chunks of sausage. Needed more gravy since the biscuits were so dry. Definitely didn&#39;t taste fresh.
Eggs Benedict - 5/5 - English muffins, topped with poached eggs, bacon, mushrooms, and hollandaise sauce. Cooked to perfection. 
Hash browns - 4/5 - I asked for them to be extra crispy and they weren&#39;t. Still tasty.
Omelette - 5/5  - Bacon and spinach omelette, bf loved it.
Crispy breakfast potatoes - 3/5 - Not crispy whatsoever.

This place would be a 5 of they stepped up their potato game and if the service was any more efficient."

Two of us got &#34;Spuds&#34; meals, one got a breakfast burrito, but the waitress was perplexed when he asked to have melted cheese over the top of it and said it could not be done! (What?)

My spuds order was a garden spuds.   It was ok- nothing spectacular.  I was concerned mine may be soggy ( with mushrooms, spinach and cheese) happy that was not the case.  The menu here is extensive and many of the dishes I saw passing by me looked good.  My friend&#39;s order was Cajun spuds and she thought it was &#34;good&#34;.

I&#39;d like to stop in again, but I see serious issues with service here.  We visited on a Saturday morning.  Not particularly busy and I noticed 4 waitresses and one bus boy.  It appears that waitresses do not (or take offense to) filling up coffee mugs.  I saw the bus boy go by once during our stay but most often was busy cleaning so not running around with the coffee pot!   I&#39;d like to say it was just our waitress, but no- because the couple across from us was waiting so long that he took to holding his empty cup in his hand and holding above his head to get service.  His waitress was different than ours so appears to be  a thing here - yet none of them were particularly busy.  I saw 3 tables that had to ASK for coffee refills.  On a weekend breakfast time, that is just not acceptable.My other dining partner had tea and that too was not refilled until end of meal upon asking.  

My companions (whose drinks it took forever to fill- I had water, but I didn&#39;t see them refilling water either!) did not want to leave a tip but I mentioned leaving a small tip had more impact than leaving none. As when questions were asked of our waitress we found her rather snarky (could be Kathy Bates&#39; sister).   Big minus here for the waitress y dropping off our check before asking if we wanted anything else.

If I venture back for one more meal, I&#39;ll try one of their many skillets.  Basically we all agreed it would be a definite return if not for such poor service. 

The prices seem reasonable for the quantity of food."

For a while it was my go to breakfast place. The food used to be great and portion sizes were huge. Lately not so much. Service has been very good, but not enough to keep me coming. Last time I called in for pick up. I ordered the hash omelet, crepes, and French toast. Everything was just underwhelming. The omelet was greasy, diced onions were huge. Just overall laziness and no pride in the food put out. Maybe it&#39;s nit picking, but when you cut into your omelet and you find an onion the size of a golf ball it just screams lazy. I suggested this place and was embarrassed I did. My friends crepes were bland and the French toast had an odd taste of onions and garlic. I used to love you gails. I really did. It may come across as harsh, but in my honest opinion you could do way better and you have in the past."

I met family for a late breakfast and ordered the same item I ordered last time I was there approximately 2 months prior. It was delicious at my last visit, and terrible today- runny, undercooked eggs and a very tiny portion of food. Very unlike Gail&#39;s. 
It is usually best to not send 
food back in a restaurant so just decided to deal with eating the potatoes and half of my brother&#39;s eggs. When our server finally came back to check on us, she was rude to me when I told her politely that the eggs were runny and undercooked and I was eating my brother&#39;s eggs. She said &#34;why didn&#39;t you tell me so I could send it back?&#34; in an accusatory tone and grinning sarcastically in that way that let&#39;s you know there is contempt for you seething beneath it. Well, now I really wasn&#39;t going to send it back because I didn&#39;t trust her to not do something disgusting to it so I declined then she said &#34;we don&#39;t usually get that complaint&#34; and walked away. 
She did not offer any further assistance and proceeded with her lousy service for the rest of our meal. 
Usually the manager is present in the floor but I did not see him after this happened to alert him. And the inedible item was not removed from the bill. 
She got a 10% tip (I always leave 20-30%) and Gail&#39;s lost my business."

The omelette was served with extra feta...when i showed this to the waitress she said &#34; well what do you want me to do?&#34; ...&#34;Take it back, remake it with just A LITTLE feta&#34;, I told her. In about 7 minutes it came back ...same amount of feta...I didnt eat it. and the waitress just took my plate without a word...When I took my bill to the counter to pay, the owner (or manager) asked &#34;and how was everything?&#34;&#34;Terrible&#34; I said and explained the situation...The manager then examined the waitress&#39;s order and stated &#34;ahhh here is the reason  ! Your waitress never wrote easy on the feta on the order..&#34;
Oh ...but was this omellete taken off the bill ??? Hell no.!!..Even knowing it was the server&#39;s fault, and knowing I didnt eat it.... I guess they need every dime they make.

The restaurant was on the smaller side-I would say your typical diner in terms of setting:booths, round tables, tons of old people (sorry, old people!) super noisy, potential doilies, coffee-a-flowin, etc...

I was in the mood for an omelette and pancakes, and this place had a very large selection on both. In fact, the menu was immense; I felt like I drowned in a sea of words. I was really in the mood for something bold and spicy to invigorate my taste buds, so I decided to get the santa fe omelette with pumpkin pancakes (that had cream cheese frosting on them yummmmm). 

The omelette  had spicy mexican chorizo, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, cheese and side of salsa, talk about a beating. To make a long story short this omelette was awesome. it was the perfect amount of spicy and flavorful, and the pumpkin pancakes tasted just as delicious as how I envisioned them in my head- the cream cheese frosting blended so well in the &#34;cake&#34; ;)

Overall, I would come here again and again and experiment with more awesome breakfast combinations."

There was nothing special about Grandma Sally&#39;s but it was typical diner breakfast comfort food at a decent price. Plus, the skillet portions were the size of my head.

Fast forward many years and I&#39;ve tried Gail&#39;s a few times now over the years. Nothing has really changed much inside as far as layout goes and it still has that old fashioned diner feel to it; complete with a stool and bar area.

I only eat breakfast items in these types of places so I can only comment on that area, which seems to be Gail&#39;s specialty anyway.

I&#39;ve tried several skillets, omelettes, and their strange hash brown wrapped omelette. Everything is standard as far as breakfast joints go with nothing really standing out except for that strange hashbrown/omelette football looking deal. At most, it&#39;s a novel idea and it looks tasty but you&#39;ll soon realize that wrapping your already delicately flavored omelette in something bland like potatoes really tends to dilute those gentle flavors. It takes healthy heaps of ketchup and hot sauce to bring it away from the edge of taste boredom.

I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to eat at Gail&#39;s with so many other tasty breakfast places in the area but if I happened to be driving past and looking for breakfast, I would not be opposed to eating here again. Solid diner type breakfast food."

We continue to go back, week after week and are never disappointed.  The menu selection goes on and on, but my favorites are the Dutch Baby, the Chef&#39;s Crepes, and they have the right batter for a Belgian Waffle.  Once in a while I will treat myself to an Apple Pancake, which rivals a similar dish offered by another local restaurant. The difference here is that Gail&#39;s offers down-home, Mom &amp; Pop food, with no pretension, like &#39;that other local restaurant&#39;.

Service is always courteous, friendly, and expedient.  My coffee is always full.  Portions are generous and reasonably priced.  We&#39;re always out in under an hour, even when I order a Dutch Baby.  While some reviewers are hell-bent on bashing &amp; trashing, I would be remiss if I did not mention that there are a few new on staff who have managed to quickly adapt to the pace of Gail&#39;s during a rush.  If we ever do have a complaint, we let Gail or Mike know.

We readily bring our visiting guests here for breakfast, and always recommend to local friends.  We will continue to do so!"

The scrambles are always a good choice, and the combos they have are a little different but real tasty. It&#39;s not a big place, and you might have to wait on a weekend, but the service is always fast and good.

The reviews are spot on.  We were seated immediately and our order came out within 5 to 10 min after being placed.  I ordered the Corned beef hash and poached eggs.  Not the best corned beef I have had but it was still very good.  I don&#39;t believe they make it in-house, the plate came with home fried potatoes which were fresh, toast or pancakes, and poached eggs.  

Our table also ordered the Two cheese omelette. Great selection of cheeses to choose from.

My partner had the Patty Cake Patty Cake.  The hollandaise was good.

Overall the food was good, the only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that it could be even better if made in-house, though I suspect the prices would have to jump to accommodate such a change.  

Disregard the insert in their menu about the ill effects of coffee.  This has been proven false by the medical community and recent studies have shown coffee is actually good for you."

It doesn&#39;t hurt that I&#39;m a breakfast nut and could eat it every meal of the day but I&#39;ve been here many times and never had a dish that was less than delicious.

This is a popular restaurant and can therefore be packed to the gills at times with a long wait but the servers do a good job of keeping up, although the stress becomes a little more evident when you order an item that requires extra work (I feel guilty ordering a smoothie at those times but they&#39;re soooo good). The food still comes out great every time. I will say, if you don&#39;t like big crowds and/or expect to be treated like you&#39;re the only customer there, stay away on weekend mornings (and if you bring small children, for the love of all that is holy, don&#39;t let them run around loose).

One more bit of evidence that this is a fantastic place is the fact that there are often local firefighters and police officers among the patrons. In my book, it&#39;s a pretty good sign when you see the pillars of the community choosing a restaurant as one of their favorites."

Our server was friendly but very forgetful we had to ask twice for our water and a few extra napkins. I ordered a chopped steak with the eggs over easy, hash browns, and raisin toast. My wife ordered an apple pancake. Our server told us it would be about 30 minutes for the apple pancake. Since we were both ravenously hungry, we ordered a short order of biscuits and gravy to split while we were waiting for our regular items to be brought out. She ended up bringing out my food and the biscuits and gravy together we ate the the biscuits and gravy and by the time the apple pancake was brought out, I was halfway done with my meal! Epic Fail on their part. 

The biscuits and gravy were OK. The biscuits were fresh and fluffy but the sausage gravy was a bit bland but did have some big chunks of sausage in it. Everything on my plate was overcooked! My over easy eggs were over medium, my hashbrowns were well done but that is way I prefer them anyway. Parts of my chopped steak were nearly inedible it was so overdone. It was delivered to my table luke warn too. The raisin toast was great though as it almost tasted like a cinnamon roll. My wife&#39;s apple pancake was also overdone. The top was extremely crispy which I did not mind but the insides were very dry and was not the most appealing. 

Although this visit completely sucked, I would definitely give this place another shot. Although everything was bad, it actually had the potential to be a kick-ass breakfast if it was only prepared properly."

I got the Denver omelette and it was eh. Not amazing, not horrible. It was just your standard omelette. Our waitress was very nice however the guy who seated us was a bit rude. He took us to our table, threw the menus on the table and walked away without saying anything. I just figured he was a grumpy man however noticed that everyone else that he seated didn&#39;t get the same treatment as us. Was is our age (20&#39;s)? I&#39;m not one to pull the race card, but was that it (Asian)? When you see everyone else getting a &#34;enjoy&#34; or &#34; your waitress will be right with you&#34;, you start to think these things.

Gail&#39;s is that place for me. It&#39;s by my work and it&#39;s usually our go-to, quick, breakfast for lunch place. You can easily get in, order, eat, enjoy your coffee and be back at work within an hour. 

I think we&#39;ve tried everything in this place. I usually stick to breakfast though. They have a daily specials menu that usually includes their combo which is some fruit topped french toast/waffle/pancake/blintz option with 2 bacon, 2 eggs and 2 sausages. That&#39;s usually the winner for me, but their regular menu is one of the largest I&#39;ve seen and also quite good. 

During the winter months, their corned beef hash omelet topped with hollandaise is ridiculous. The breakfast burrito and quesadillas with chorizo are pretty great too. I&#39;ve picked from great scrambles, omelets encased in shredded hash browns, six different benedicts, eight different crepes, and plenty more. 

They also have lunch, which my coworker enjoys. I think I saw a country fried steak triple decker club sandwich as a special the other day. 

It&#39;s definitely more of a diner instead of a trendy breakfast place. I wouldn&#39;t recommend them over a Walker Brother&#39;s or other popular brunch places, but the portions are generous and the service is quick with their food and coffee refills. Their variety and efficiency puts them over the top for me, especially when some idiot schedules a 12:30 meeting that I need to rush back for."

The restaurant was only half full, and we still had to wait a few minutes before even being acknowledged by the hostess and seated. This service surprisingly worsened as time went on because, sadly, the kind busboy serving me coffee was the full extent of attention we received from the wait staff.

A simple acknowledgment from the waitress or a simple &#34;I&#39;ll be with you in a few minutes&#34; would have been appreciated. My family and I are unsure about trying again.

It was fairly empty when a regular walks in, gets the usual. What is it with regulars and oatmeal. I was warned by the other yelpers about the menu, and didn&#39;t believe it until I see with my own eyes. Total confusion as to what to get, it&#39;s so confusing you don&#39;t even know what you feel like having. So what the hell I&#39;ll get something exotic. Got the mi amore omelette from the spuds section. When they say encased in hash browns, it&#39;s as literal as it gets. So by the time I&#39;m done scraping them off, and picking my way through the Italian sausage and mozz cheese, it&#39;s pretty unrecognizable. I ate half of this huge thing and was able to eat the other half in the Twin Cities this morning. The pancakes had a pancake mix after taste that didn&#39;t make them my favorite. The coffee was weak even for me, who goes to Dunkin Donuts for the coffee. Service was friendly. Loved the decor, bordering on kitchy.

Their prices were decent for the amount of food you get. Paid about 8 bucks for a omelet that came with salsa and potatoes with onion and with 2 pancakes. It was called Santa Fe omelet, definitely recommend it. The food was done really fast, which I was very surprised but than again it is an omelet and pancake so shouldn&#39;t take that long anyways. The service was ok, throughout the whole stay no one came even once to check on us.

The service is decent too, I&#39;d say the bus boys are the friendliest of the work bunch. My one complaint about their food is that the potatoes (not to confuse with their hashbrowns) always have a rough cut of under cooked onions and it&#39;s very unappetizing! They should just mince up the onions or caramelize them before adding to potatoes. And my last complaint is the women&#39;s bathroom. You walk in and there are 2 sinks...yet one stall with one toilet. It&#39;s very awkward!!! I had to do my business and walked into the stall and as I sat down on the toilet an elderly woman walks in and the crack in the door of the stall can make it visible for anyone standing and waiting to see you do your business. So now I&#39;m like wtf!? And then 10 seconds later a woman with her daughter walk in and it&#39;s now a freaking party in the bathroom. I got frustrated and just got up (without having done my business) washed my hands in a haste and barged out. I would go back because it&#39;s the one breakfast place that isn&#39;t always packed on the weekends with decent food, but that bathroom can be a deal breaker."

Went there a few times and today again for brunch. The omelet I ordered was actually quite greasy and tasteless.  Coffee was hot but quite diluted.  Pancakes had good texture and flavor."

Gail&#39;s was chosen mostly because of the location, being close to our event, and the good reviews.  For a small, non-chain restaurant probably not used to such large groups (especially one as unusual as ours), they took care of us pretty well.
The menu had quite a selection of unique and creative dishes, and I got tons of great feedback from my group members about the taste and quality of the food.  The service was friendly, even if it was a bit obvious the servers were confused by our dress (my fault, I completely forgot to tell them what the gathering was for!), and there were a few people who had to remind our servers about their drink order.  Coffee mugs were refilled quickly, though the quality of the coffee itself seemed to sway quite dramatically between refills.  
I had gotten a very interesting dish which consisted of cheesy scrambled eggs with diced ham and half of a baked squash filled with raisins, cranberries, walnuts, and apples.  Like I said, unique and creative!  And pretty tasty, too.  The eggs were perfect.  The squash was good, certainly the talk of the table, but it was missing just a little something... a little drizzle brown sugar, cinnamon, or mildly-sweet syrup over the fruit, maybe, to bring it all together.   
Other than very, very minor niggles like that, it was obvious that the restaurant was going out of their way to make sure our meal was pleasant.  Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and their food.  The next time we do this event, if they&#39;d have us, I think we will come back."

They have many different breakfast dishes to choose from.  I chose the french toast dipped in egg nog with cherries on top, two eggs, one bacon and one sausage link.  The food here is extroardinary. 

My waitress brought her A-game.  Coming back to check on us for coffee, water, etc.

The place was crowded with Sunday morning diners but definately didn&#39;t feel rushed.

Great customer service. The employees were extremely friendly and patient with us as got confused with so many options

You can create your own pizza however you see fit. This is like a Subway for pizza with more than 70 options. They allow you to add as many ingrediants as you want for no extra cost. They have about 6 base sauces, 7 different cheese options and over 40 ingrediants. They are very generous,when it comes to putting all of these on pizza ...

The pizza crust it really thin like a roti/ flat bread so it could get really crisp. But you get a mega pizza,where they fuse two crusts together to make it thick ..

Pizza i must tell you is delicious ...  A must try !"

I like the selection for beverages as well.  There were 4 different types of teas along with a coke fountain machine!

The formula is similar : fresh and unlimited ingredients, baked and served in under 10 minutes, to be enjoyed in a super trendy and upbeat dining room.

What stood out to me were some of the more unique topping options, including brussel sprouts and anchovies! Like the other brands, they have a gluten-free crust option, but unlike the others, they take the time to confirm if the choice is a preference or an allergy. It&#39;s an extra two dollars for the gf crust, but it is a larger diameter than the standard 11&#34;.

The price is decent for the value, starting at just under $8 a person. Considering the fresh ingredients and the ability to customize portions, this is a fair price to be in control of your own healthy creation!

They also have some nice craft beers in bottles to enjoy your meal with.

This place is great for a lunch break with co-workers, but may be a little on the pricey side for families on a budget. There are kids sized crusts, but you&#39;re looking to spend well over $30 for a family meal."

It&#39;s kind of like the pizza equivalent of Chipotle, Salata, or Subway (only tons better than a Subway). I seldom give a 5 star rating so readily, but this place is truly special. 

Pros:

-Full customization of pizza is available. 

-A number of &#34;MODs&#34; are available to try and sample flavors. It is a good way to familiarize yourself with different flavor combinations

-Staff was very efficient. You could easily squeeze this place into your lunch hour

-Flavor of the Jasper was beyond amazing. It was VERY well spiced and blended together

-Traditional portion sizes will leave most people satisfied

-Salads are available.


Cons

- Grease may be a drawback to some people. If you are the kind of person that needs to put a paper towel on your slice of pizza, you may take issue with it


Bottom line: I&#39;ve NEVER had a pizza product quite this good with this kind of unique presentation. I will stop short of saying it is the best pizza ever, but I see it hard to beat this specific type of business model"

Brand new to Mod Pizza, in town for a quick trip for work, fellow yelpers- I love you- the reviews were right on. I walked in and was welcomed before my body was fully through the door. I think they could see I was a newbie, they asked if it was my first time... I said yes, but felt prepared based on yelpers &amp; reviewing time or website (I felt so educated...) so I ordered the Calexico pizza and a side salad (ok, keeping it real, also ordered a glass of wine-yum) they confirmed along the way my toppings &amp; ingredients for the salad. (thank you!) I started munching on the side salad, which was simply amazing, and they called my name a few minutes later for the pizza, I couldn&#39;t believe it was that fast. This was when the magic happened- this was probably one of the best pizzas I&#39;ve every had. Spicy, fresh &amp; such great flavors.

Maybe it was because my expectations were a bit low since quick pizza chains are proliferating right now but I think MOD is legitimately the best of the bunch. They offer three pizza sizes and just one crust - which I&#39;m good with. Do one and do it well. Where the variety comes in is in the toppings. Pay one price for any combo and they offer lots of pre-selected combos to make it easier. I tried the seasonal &#34;winston&#34; pizza which was delicious! The crust looks pretty unassuming as they build the pizza but once it comes out of the pizza oven (no conveyor belt oven here, a real pizza oven) it&#39;s that thin, pleasantly charred, artisan pizza crust I&#39;d expect a upscale Italian restaurant. My family all enjoyed their various pizza topping combinations - even my son&#39;s strange hawaiian pizza with pesto sauce creation was gobbled up.

On top of the good food and trendy surroundings, the staff was super nice across the board. Really friendly, sweet with our kids, helpful, and fun. I&#39;m looking forward to going back for more pizza and maybe a beer - they even have some on draft, which is unusual in a counter service joint!"

OK OK don&#39;t get mad you chicago lover deep dishes....we moved from Texas and we were missing the thin and crispy, the stone oven and MOD delivers! So we went on a Fri night, actually our 7 yr bday and this pace was JAMMING!! I mean line was out the door and did I mention it was raining...yep people still were standing in line so we decided to stick it out and join the crowd. Boy were we pleased!

Its sort of like Chipotle where you go through the line and pick your toppings, and anything can go on your pizza, they throw it in the oven and yummers is all I can say!
 
So on Easter we decided, lets head to a place without a crowd...ok who we kidding we were craving that build your own fresh taste thin crust pizza; and Easter brunch couldn&#39;t be more merrier xo

Right away we were welcomed by the staff, the manager which we know by Rodriguez recognized us (I think he kind of did but seemed to act like he knew us forever, making us feel like we were family!) and started a convo with us about Austin TX (we just moved from there) and how they opened one there and so on, he made our pizzas and told us to sit and relax he will bring it to us! Served at a self serve place BINGO! 20 points right there...(BTW the guy next to us did as well LOL, but we still felt special) several times they asked us f we liked it, needed anything, a couple minutes later another employee came out with stickers for our daughter, postcards... I mean this was a good friendly brunch! 
Very welcoming, very clean, and very satisfying!!!
They have a soda machine but you really have to taste their teas! and mixed with their lemonade will put any arnold palmer to shame!! LOL

But all in all We are very impressed with this place and are ready to visit it this week. Again all the employees went out of their way to please us but we only recall Rodriguez (thats our last name too) 
Thank you for coming to Killdeer, we really needed you as an option for lunch and dinner....brunch...hey try to  open up for breakfast too! At least on the weekends, breakfast pizzas are yummy!!

After ordering our food, it took us 25 mins to get our food, considering its call &#34;Mod pizza....superfast&#34;  you would expect a faster wait time.   When we recieved the pizza it was a little to burnt on the bottom....reminded me of burnt toast that you try to scrape off with a knife. 

Flavor wise pretty good, and flavor is objective since we all determine our pizza choice. I am a fan of thin crust, but their crust and dough of the pizza wasnt anything to rave about and I believe to have a great pizza it starts with the flavor and quality of
 the dough.

Their cinnamon side dessert was a fail, it was dry due to how long they left it in the oven."

Think subway for pizza.  Pick your size,  then go crazy with your toppings.   Sit down and in about ten minutes your name is called.  Not creative,  go for a suggested pizza.  Perfect when everyone wants different toppings. 

Crust is thin, crispy, but not dry.  Want more of a flat bread, just skip the sauce. 

And a first for me, praise on an ice tea.  Holy moly, pear ice tea.  Incredible, I didn&#39;t know I needed this in my life.   I might pop in just for a tea in the future.  My hubby had a berry lemonade that was delicious too."

It was just a breath of fresh air to walk into a &#39;to-go&#39; restaurant and be treated so kindly and have the staff treat you like old friends. I guess the rough day I was having showed when I was checking out the food and Mike offered a free shake and gift card to make my day better.

For what you pay for - this is basically the subway or chipotle of pizza joints.  The food was good, made fast and to your liking.  I asked for well done but not burnt and they did just that!  The crust is probably pre made and packaged but, it&#39;s a fast food pizza place, not a family owned pizzeria. I have to say, the Carmelized Pear iced tea was really good too!  I came with my 2 year old nephew and I have to say this place isn&#39;t very kid friendly or inviting for children so, would have liked more of that but, it was a nice lunch and the pear tea is great"

You start off by selecting the size pizza you want (GF too!!), then you can select one of the favorites or make your own.

I would classify Shoeless Joe&#39;s as your typical Bar and Grille. There are flat screen TV&#39;s pretty much all over the place, so don&#39;t worry about getting a seat you won&#39;t like. 

The food here is really, really good. For the appetizer, we got the calamari and baked clams. For my entree, I got the chicken bacon cheddar sandwich, but substituted the Poppy seed dressing for regular mayonnaise. My mouth was watering looking at how beautiful the sandwich looked. And the avocado....enough said.

The guests with me had the pasta with vodka sauce and a beef sandwich. Both options were good to them as well.

The staff there are all really friendly and the manager also stopped by our table as well. Our server always stopped by our table periodically, giving us refills, answering questions, and even making jokes.

Food 3/10
Sports Ball Tv&#39;s 9/10
Alchohol, I have no idea but assume it&#39;s awesome.

So far I&#39;ve only had a bacon cheddar burger and tots and seasoned fries.
The burger was OK at best.  It was a very basic, bland, no seasoning preformed patty that was NOT cooked to order.  Tots are tots and seasoned fries are basic with some powder shaken on top of them.  Tasted identical to the red robin seasoning actually, so just seasoned salt mostly.  The waitress didn&#39;t even pretend to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked.  (she was great otherwise and this isn&#39;t her fault).  I said I&#39;d like mine medium and my other party member was not given a chance to ask.  They both came out the same 100% grey doneness.  Pretzel bun was ok.  Lettuce, tomato, onion were all fresh, cheddar was perfectly melted.  But even all that wasn&#39;t enough to give this overpriced burger and meal a good rating.

$15 for a bacon cheddar burger, tots, and a soda.  And it was really poor honestly.  You could pay less and have a better burger and side across the street at Culvers.  Very sad.

My coworker previously had the &#34;homemade chili&#34; and the boneless wings.  He also paid about $16+ dollars for what tasted like canned chili and the tiniest, useless, flavorless, boneless nuggets.  He said you&#39;d be better off getting chicken mcnuggets lol."

We arrived in the evening around the fourth inning of the Cubs division game. The bar area wasn&#39;t that crowded. All of the servers were standing at the bar staring at the Tv&#39;s and ignoring customers. The hostess station was empty. We waited about 5 minutes before simply seating ourselves. Our drink order took about 15 minutes to arrive. We had to ask about our drinks, when they arrived, they were quite watered down. We ordered food, however it took another 10-15 minutes just to get a simple bowl of chili. The manager was very responsive and apologetic when he learned of our issues. The chili was ok, I&#39;ve had much better. It was really loaded with chili powder to the point it was dark black.  There was not much other flavor as the chili powder overpowered the bowl.  The nachos were good, but the grilled chicken was a bit dry. The manager and server were extremely attentive through-out the service. 
If you&#39;re looking for a sit down restaurant with  GOOD food, there are other choices in the area. If you are looking for a place to watch the game and grab a bite it&#39;s not the worst choice."

Service was a little slow in the bar area.   And it&#39;s quite loud.  The outside has a long sofa and long fireplace area.  Nice and cozy. They have an appetizer specials until 7 which is nice.
shoeless-joes-ale-house-and-grille-addison-2,Gregg S.,Sldgrd6THr9n9XlR1bLR6w,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,1,0,0,5,WoXUpx31XZVJ5DqLqbU4rA,3.0,2016-10-10,"I was really excited to see this place open up. It is something new for the area. Have been getting tired of all of the local places to go watch a game.
  In a sports bar I like to see big HDTV&#39;s. They have a lot of TV&#39;s spread out all over the place. All I had to do was ask and they would put on whatever I wanted. Their biggest TV is strange. It has a cross in the middle of it. They&#39;ve taken 4 TV&#39;s with no borders and stuck them together. I have a real hard time trying to follow a puck or even a ball moving on that TV. Nice picture but hard to watch.
  The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of their food. I would have given it 2 stars but the staff was very friendly. I have been there 4 times already. Ordering something different every time. The first time I had the Sausage, peppers and potatoes. I have never seen 2 whole sausage links on a plate with the peppers and potatoes. Usually the sausage is cut up. I could live with that. What I really did not like was the half inch of grease on the bottom of the plate. I would have liked to have the potatoes browned or cooked a little more.
  The second time I had the Jambalaya. What came out was a dark orange looking plate of goop. You mostly could only see the orange thick liquid stuff. The orange stuff did not taste that bad but there was not that much of any thing else. Somewhere underneath the orange stuff was suppose to be rice and meat. The rice was under-cooked and crunchy. Needed to be cooked more. There also needed to be more rice. You could barely see any off the rice in the orange stuff. Cook the rice more and give you more rice to soak up the orange goop. Less orange goop. More meat and rice.
The 3rd time I came during happy hour so I ordered something off the happy hour menu. I ordered the Chicken fingers. A lot of crunchy breading (too thick). The worst part is that it did not seem like it was cooked long enough. You could tell that it was something that they purchase already breaded and frozen.
   The last time I was there I ordered a bowl of chili. I really like a good chili. It really is a nice sized bowl. For some reason the chili tasted like it was burnt. It says that you get tortilla chips with it. You only get 4 that are inside the chili on the inside edge of the bowl. Might as well not even mention that you get chips.
   As far as the staff I really have very little complaints. When I sat at the bar 2 times the bartenders were very good. For the most part the only complaints that I had with the servers at the tables is that they tend to get lost for a while. It took longer to get my bill one time than it did to get my meal. 
  I will go back to watch a game and drink but I may think twice about ordering any of the food. The food wasn&#39;t awful but there was nothing so far that I would want to come back for. I will try the pizza next time but after reading one of the reviews, not sure about that either."

The staff and management is very friendly and for being a relatively new operation it runs very fluid. The bar area and high top tables seem to get the busiest. If you want a game on, they will put it on for you. If you enjoy beer like I do, this is the place for you. They have at least 30 beers on tap and plenty of bottled beer as well. They have daily specials on drinks and food. My wife and I went there the other night for dinner and really enjoyed the atmosphere and our meal. Menu has plenty of options for all taste buds. I had the unbreaded Wings with the sweet heat sauce and I have to say, the sauce is some of the best I have ever tasted and the chicken wings were fall off the bone. My wife got the California Chicken Wrap without tomato with tater tots and said it was excellent. I am giving it five stars because the atmosphere is great and the food is tasty. We will definitely be back again!!"

Prices are a little high overall but you&#39;re getting better than normal bar food and pretty generously sized portions. If you&#39;re getting specials (either daily or happy hour) then the price is actually lower than that of comparable restaurants nearby.

I tried an appetizer and two burgers here. The boneless wings with BBQ sauce had tender chicken with a tasty and ever-so-slightly spicy sauce. The batter could&#39;ve been a bit more crispy but it was enjoyable overall. A nice way to start the meal for about $5 with the half-price appetizer special.

The burgers I tried were a great bargain for $5 including a side. The patties are thick and juicy and the vegetables are fresh. The meat itself is tasty enough where additions like cheddar cheese and bacon add some flavor but aren&#39;t really necessary to enjoy the burger. I really liked the fried egg on the fried louie, perfectly runny to match well with the rest of the burger. Debatably better than the $11-$14 burgers I&#39;ve tried at the famous burger places. The fries had a good flavor to them and were seasoned just right while the tater tots were nice and crispy.

If you&#39;re in the area, definitely give Bar Louie a try -- especially if you can get specials at a great price."

Only once was the service really good, and I haven&#39;t seen that server again.
I&#39;ve gone to Bar Louie on several occasions.  Mostly at lunch with one or more co-workers.  We usually eat from the $8 lunch menu, which is a great deal, but sometimes off the regular menu. Between me and various co-workers, we&#39;ve had several different items and like I said, the food is really good.   
They seem to have only one or two people working the entire restaurant. One waitress for a large place, and the bartender doubles as a server and brings food out from the kitchen.  This place should be packed at lunch, but since service is so slow, I would take a guess and say workers in the area are going where they can get served and back to the office in an hour.
One time, I went after work and sat the bar.  That was really bad too. I arrived about 15 minutes before my friend.  I sat there for 10 of those 15 without ever being acknowledged by the bartender. Even after we did get served and ordered some appetizers, our glasses were empty for quite a while before we were asked if we wanted more.   Wish they&#39;d hire a few more and make this the place it could be!"

The waitresses are always great, but there is definitely room for improvement elsewhere.  Last time we came to this location we found a hair fried into the breading of the fried calamari. The waitress was great and apologized so many times. She was as disgusted and embarrassed as we were. We also received coupons for free apps on our next visit. Tonight, the service was again good. However, I don&#39;t find it sanitary, professional or appropriate for a employee to be smoking his vape pen right next the kitchen and where customers are sitting. How is this acceptable by management here? Most places don&#39;t allow their customers to smoke these vape pens but here at Bar Louie I guess it&#39;s appropriate for their employees to do it in the middle of the place while on the clock. I included a photo for reference"

The ambience and atmosphere was great. The beer selection was also great. I&#39;m always a bit concern reading bad reviews, especially since I&#39;m not a regular and that seems  to be the common denominator along with poor service. Again, 4th visit and while I have experience a difference in treatment compare to the so call &#34;regulars&#34;, I have not experience bad service. Today I sat by the bar and had an awesome bartender who knows a thing or two about customer service because my group was well taken care of. Very nice job! Unfortunately the name on the receipt states Server as his name. 

I sat by the bar and ordered the especial 20oz beer (Blue Moon Draft). I also ordered the Tortilla soup, which was off the chart tasty and had a kick to it. When I finally got hungry, I decided to try the Chicken Tacos; soft chicken serve with a touch of cheese on top, guacamole, poco de gallo, white rice and beans. All served in individual small plates/containers so you could make/mix your own tacos. I have to admit, the chicken was not that tasty, it wasn&#39;t bad either, the portion was good, but it was short of flavor. They have a Bar Louie hot sauce and that seemed to do the trick. Great sauce!

Again, great service, outstanding beer selection and tortilla soup with okay chicken tacos. So all is good, I&#39;ll be back!"

The wait for service at the tables is far too long, and we typically have to flag them down for refills, food orders, etc. 
There has been a lot of turnover in the staff, so the question is why? That must be answered if they hope to drive new business or be happy with the captive audience doe the hotel."

We were staying at the Holiday Inn that&#39;s connected to it and wanted to grab a few beers before the end of the night. 

It was a Thursday night around 11:30 so not crowded (which is personally my taste) so we just sat right at the bar and browsed the beer menu. 

Our waiter Douglas was so awesome! My date had mixed drinks but I stuck with beer for the night and Douglas was very knowledge in the beer selection. He had me describe what I normally like to drink, brought me a sample of something new and I loved it! I think I had 4 new beers all recommended and I was allowed to sample each one beforehand if I wished. 

I&#39;m not sure about the food selection that time of night I&#39;m sorry. We weren&#39;t hungry at all but I believe I saw some people eating so the kitchen might still be open late as well. 

If you&#39;re looking for a nice bar with a good selection of beer and a clean environment I would really recommend this Bar Louie. Specifically this one though. I&#39;ve had not great experiences at other locations. 

Thank you Douglas for being a great bartender and loving your job! We can&#39;t wait to be back!

Side bonus, if you&#39;re staying in the hotel you can bring your drink back to the room."

I sat at the bar because I was eating alone (am a loser) and I didn&#39;t want to take up a whole table. Well, I think because I didn&#39;t order a drink or anything, the bartender kind of ignored me. I would have to flag them up to even order my food. He also never gave me condiments like ketchup and mustard even though he gave them to everybody else.

  Instead of making you own burger you have to pick from one of the burgers they decide tastes good. Sure you can take anything off that burger but to substitute any topping or add that costs you money. The $5 burgers come with fries or tots. There were roughly 12-15 tots on my plate..

It wasn&#39;t until I traveled out of state that I found out it had become a national chain. While the décor has been updated, the neighborhood tavern feel of new locations remains the same. The food, while remaining pub food, is consistently better than what you would find in most pubs. The menu can be somewhat limiting though, as they tend to concentrate on the drinks over the eats. A special shout out for the loaded fries (or tots if that&#39;s your preference). It&#39;s like a combination of potato skins and nachos and it&#39;s a very reasonable upcharge.

The service is the roughest spot here because I have had the absolute best service some times and the remarkably not so good service at other times, and that is really unfortunate for such a friendly place.

Good deal, right? The atmosphere is neutral, the beer list is decent and, as usual, the service is quick. My app was not part of the 1/2 price apps - and I&#39;m sick of the menu or staff not clarifying. The bartender was nice about it and bought me a beer - but this isn&#39;t the first time. Also, my flatbread came out missing an ingredient. Other Bartender was nice and didn&#39;t charge me when I asked for it on the side. 

For a corporate place - some stuff is really half ass backwards here (and other locations). Doesn&#39;t seem to be a particular staffing issue - they are pretty friendly. I just don&#39;t like being overcharged. Even with the corrections,  my bill was still a couple bucks off."

I can see why. We were here on a Friday Night. It is a fairly big place, and quite busy.
There were 3 of us, we sat at one of the long tables and we were helped right away.

I am not a beer drinker but, they have a  lot of amazing beers to chose from according to the beer drinker of the group.
Our server even let him have a few samples as he was not crazy about the first one he had.
We all had a late dinner. I had the Louie Burger with fries, after I took off the onions and pickles it was awesome!
I chose the fries, which I really liked, but the other 2 chose Tater Tots!
They said they loved them...my friend even got Chocolate cake to go. I forgot to ask her how it was. She did not complain so I am guessing for $9.00 it must have been good. Or she would of Said something. I will update later if it was not. Too late at night for me to call her now.

They had a live band there, which was actually really good. But, entirely too loud if you want to talk. But, that is what bands are , loud!  So I give them points because, they were fun and enjoyable.  They even had a dance floor and people were dancing, quite a few as well.
We like the food a lot and the service was great. Atmosphere was pretty great as well. Lots of parking in the lot also."

First when we asked for a booth they told us that one was not available  however one opened up as soon as we were place at a table right below a LOUD speaker. Then we asked to be moved which was terrible because it confused the poor waitresses who for the life of them could not figure out who on earth was going to serve us. Then once we ordered our food we asked for sides of ranch and BBQ sauce which our waitress forgot 3 TIMES! I understand that they were busy but that was ridiculous, then our grandmother asked for water which took the waitress 20 minutes to bring to.  Honestly I was the most frustrating experience that we do not want to repeat. Unfortunately we will not be returning to this establishment."

All i knew is that it was connected to a holiday inn, and was just sort of inconspicuously  &#34;there&#34;. My friend said that every day there are specials on food and drinks, and it so happened to be monday, which meant that the appetizers were going to be half off. 

Walking into this restaurant, one is greeted with a very large selection of draft beer. From domestics, to imports, IPA&#39;s, obscure beers, etc...This made me happy. 

My group and I ordered calamari, buffalo wings, and nachos as appetizers. They were half off, and for the deal, the buffalo wings and nachos were great, and the calamari a bit soggy and lackluster. 

For drinks, i ordered a on the rocks margarita and an ultimate bloody mary. The margarita was a bit too sweet for my taste, and the bloody mary was stellar. It was basically garnished with lunch meat which made my bloody experience seem like a third course, and it was spicy and had guiness in it. 

For dinner i had the blackened shrimp po&#39;boy sandwich and holy shit this was awesome. The shrimp were cooked well, they were flaborful, the vegetables were fresh, the sandwich was very well composed. This came with a side of sweet potato fries and they were awesome too. Service was good too, out waitress was attentive.

Overall, I would definitely come back and have a few beers and eat some more food."

Parking is REALLY sparse.  They are connected to a Holiday inn, but their personal parking lot only houses about 30 cars total--this too much for the traffic on this particular Wednesday evening around 6;30.  So we had to park at the Holiday Inn and hoped for the best (it worked out, but I don&#39;t know if it would be worth the risk again!)

We chose to sit outside, and it was seat-yourself out there.  It was a nice little patio area.  Shaded and clean.  I really liked it.  It was WAY better than the inside of the restaurant, which was like a tundra.  Some people might like that kind of thing, but I am ALWAYS cold, and I would have frozen like a popsicle!

I really like the deal they have with the 1/2 price apps until 7 (limited menu).  My friend and I were there first, and took advantage of that right away while we waited for our other friends.

Our waitress was nice (her name escapes me right now).  She had strong opinions about the food and the drinks which was helpful.  It&#39;s always good to know what the staff would actually eat.

We got:
Pomegranate margarita--strong and delicious!
1/2 price buffalo wings
1/2 price pomodoro bruchetta
Tater tots that were wrapped in jalapeno and then wrapped in bacon, then skewered.  Yes, I am serious.

So between the four of us, there was more than enough food.  It came out hot and delicious.

My personal favorite was the bruchetta.  It was a beautiful presentation with the toasted bread on the side instead of getting all soggy--BONUS POINTS FOR THAT.

The buffalo wings were spicy, and the tots were SUPER spicy!!!  All of it was delicious, though.

Overall, I would definitely be back.  Especially for some more 1/2 price appetizers!"

I wish this place was near us here in Cali!  I am super bummer we were only at the attached hotel for one night due to flight delays at ORD - we were utterly exhausted mentally and physically and we just wanted a couple hours of sleep... But the Louie&#39;s was ROCKIN!  There was a line outside to get in a mile long and the 20 somethings waiting in the line were all little hotties.   We wanted to go check it out, but after hours (6 hours) of flight delays in 2 different cities during our day we were not in any condition to volunteer to stand in that line for a drink. hehe 

I had to wait until morning to fall in love with Louie!  BREAKFAST!  The service was top notch and the bar was SUPER CLEAN and ready to host us even though just hours earlier it looked like a scene out of COCKTAILS or Coyote Ugly!  I was impressed.  The server was very friendly and brought me my coffee, OJ, and water that I requested with perfect timing and without that stare I usually get from early mroning servers like &#34;seriously?  3 drinks all at once?&#34;  haha

I wish we hadn&#39;t been so snobbish.  

There&#39;s a great large and rotating tap and bottled beer selection.  When I went, they had a British banana bread beer that was delicious and actually tasted like banana bread!  Get it while you can.  (3/11/2013)

Blackberry, Orange &amp; Brie salad was amazing, and they nicely split it for my wife and me.  The fish tacos were the best (non-fried style) I think I&#39;ve had.  Black beans were also excellent--strong lime flavor and nice fresh salsa.  Cheese quesadillas from the appetizer menu were a little more ordinary, but still perfectly good.

It was on a Sunday night during an (annoyingly loud) Blackhawks game, and they apparently were running their happy hour specials.  During happy hour, appetizers are half price.  I couldn&#39;t believe the 14 oz beer I ordered was only $3."

Too bad the waitress doesn&#39;t know they&#39;re there! Seriously, asked her if there was a beer list and she pointed me to the Happy Hour list on the table with 20 versions of Budweiser on it. Had to go to the bar to get a list of what was in the yummy taps there... 

We&#39;ve been diggin&#39; the New Belgium Snow Day in the bottle and on tap it&#39;s even better!

Burger was really good, and calamari was a steal at happy hour prices... Flatbread was meh, soggy and the toppings a little too mushy for me. Overall, I&#39;d be happy to have this place in my neighborhood (Bar Louie folks, if you&#39;re reading this -- check out the old Real Time Sports building in St. Charles -- it would be PERFECT!).

I love the food whether it&#39;s burgers or appetizers or small plates and flatbreads. 

I&#39;ve had the Fried Louie burger many times and it&#39;s a great indulgence once in awhile.

They have a different drink special every night, I am partial to their $5 martini/glass of wine night on Thursday nights. 

Their appetizers are great and very good for sharing, the pretzel sticks are awesome and I absolutely love the truffle butter popcorn! ( plus at 3.50 it&#39;s a great deal!) 

I have never had a bad drink here and saying it&#39;s a full bar is an understatement. I love the atmosphere and it&#39;s a great place to come with a group, or just a couple friends or even a date.

One warning: If you are planning on coming with a date, or a group that wants to have conversation make sure it&#39;s not on a night with live music, because it can get quite loud. They do have a nice outdoor seating area, so I suppose that&#39;d be an option to escape the noise.

The wait staff and bartenders are very attentive, especially with large groups. They aren&#39;t shy to make food and drink suggestions and they are great about splitting checks.

This has definitely become a favorite oasis for my friends and I

It was a bit hard to find because it is connected to a hotel and we had to drive through a couple parking lots to get to it. 
I love the set-up of the place, with the bar in the center and tables surrounding it. There was a small band set up in the corner playing acoustic cover songs. That was unexpected and sort of neat, but I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t play all night. I like to have my regular music played over the speakers when I&#39;m at a bar, unless I&#39;m going to see a band I know and like. 
The bartender was very informative, helpful and friendly. She offered to give us samples of a few beers we were asking about. There was a raspberry ale that was really sweet that I liked. They had a beer named after Mount Prospect (the town this Bar Louie is in) from the Wild Onion brewery. There was also a double chocolate stout that I loved. They offer two sizes of the beers on draught. We ordered a couple beers and a cheese quesadilla appetizer.

Fresh garlic bread with chicken, cheese, lettuce and onion.  So juicy and flavorful.  BUT the music is SO LOUD that you cannot hear yourself think.

Plus when you are showing whale wars and restaurant impossible on the tv&#39;s plus sports games, seriously?  Im not seeing a full dance floor.  why can&#39;t you turn the music down below deafening so others can talk???  

I ordered a vodka tonic with rose&#39;s lime-to my taste buds surprise they do not have rose&#39;s lime and substituted lime juice.  OMG!!!!!  UGH!!  These two ingredients are NOT interchangeable.  And when I returned the drink to the bartender, she looked very put out with me......  

I actually saw a table of people leave because of the music volume.  

You have a great location with great decor, great tv&#39;s and a delicious menu.  Why not look around you and take in the environment and maximize the Wednesday 7pm experience for us.  We are not hear to bar hop or dance,  we are here to eat and relax after work."

They have really good $1 burgers during happy hour and a huge selection of great beers. I enjoyed the SmuttyNose. I am a bit of a craft beer kinda dude and they have quite a few to please a lot of appetites. The prices were low in my opinion. Lots of cheap specials, all of the food was very good. Buffalo chicken flatbread &amp; boneless wings. Friendly tentative staff, hot bar tenders. Beautiful girls in a modern new bar, what can this city CA boy ask for?"

Since it&#39;s a chain, I can&#39;t say that the food is different or unique from any other Bar Louie I&#39;ve been too, but I did notice ALL the beers on tap. 

I&#39;m not a huge beer fan, but they did have a few that I like. I was going to go for a cocktail, but I found out there was Woodchuck on draft (technically cider, not beer). I love Woodchuck, so it was nice drinking it on draft instead of a bottle like I usually do. I could really taste the difference.

Bar Louie is probably one of the nicer bars in the Mount Prospect area, so it&#39;s a nice place to go for drinks."

The draft beer selection is excellent, which I enjoy (due to my, uh, problem). 

The only glaring issue during my recent visit was the slow service. There were literally four other patrons in the entire restaurant and it still took a full hour to order, eat, and pay. 

I would recommend drinking here if you have no time constraints, but go somewhere else if you need to pound a few quickly on your lunch break."

Mr. NY must be used to drinking in a library, because I wouldn&#39;t call this place anything near &#34;loud&#34;, even compared to the other suburban bars around.

The good:
-DJ is an awesome bartender, and the others are nice as well
-40 beers on tap, random specials throughout the week
-Great place to watch Sports games, with lots of nice flat screens
-half price apps from 4-7pm every day
-Food is delicious, I&#39;ve had most of the aps, their burger, and the pulled pork

The bad:
-parking lot is somewhat small for the suburbs
-mixed drinks are pricey (I only go for the beer anyways)

The ugly:
-Womens college basketball is frequently on 1 of the TVs (WTF?)"

We ordered margaritas and mojito both did not meet our expectation. Food was mediocre ( nachos &amp; sandwiches) what could go wrong. The manager was really nice to us and comped our meal.  Then we made a second attempt for lunch today, ordered mojitos. My mango mojito was more like mango juice. I also ordered the bltt which was ok, but my friend ordered the same but with specifications...her order came to the table wrong. There were only three tables going you think maybe they could get an order right. Next time try writing it down.

Good neighborhood place ( also serves as the Holiday Inn bar) with one major exception.  When they have a band playing, the atmosphere is ridiculous, The music is obnoxious,  The band is usually not talented  so they just play loudly . You definitely  can&#39;t  talk or even hear the servers. You will find yourself just sitting and waiting for a break.  There is nowhere in the bar to get away from the noise.

It was a hopping place, the food and the beer were pretty good. So my husband and I decided to try out the Bar Louie in Mount Prospect. Lucky us, we came on a Wednesday when they have $5 buckets of beer! How can you go wrong with that? We have been back on a few Wednesdays now. Each time getting the bucket and something to eat. I have had most of their salads, and a burger. Every time, it was all good- except once when my salad dressing tasted like mayonnaise. I had the same salad before, so obviously it was probably a fluke. I didn&#39;t complain, because I used to wait tables and if it&#39;s tolerable I usually deal with it (maybe a stupid decision on my part).
It&#39;s great that they have an outdoor patio for sunny days. It faces the parking lot but if you have a $5 bucket of beer.. who really cares? 
The wait staff is always nice and efficient."

As everyone knows, Tuesday is dollar burger night. The first time I went I ordered a water and my friend got a drink and we got our dollar burgers. Second time, my mom and I both ordered drinks and we got our dollar burgers. 

Tonight though we both ordered water and when we went to order the dollar burgers, the waitress goes Oh, you need to order a drink in order to get the dollar burger. So my mom goes ok, so we need one drink and then we&#39;ll get the burgers? No, you both need drinks. I did not want my drink, as I am trying to watch what I eat and the burger was bad enough. I did not need to order a sugary soft drink or an over-priced bar drink on top of it. Then the manager comes out and gives an explanation about how he loses 5 dollars every time a burger passes through his kitchen on dollar burger night. Well thats great, but if your losing money then you need to stop the special in my opinion. 

So over all:
It is a good restaurant with excellent burgers and tator tots. I do think that they need to get their act together and we should have been told from day one how dollar burger night works. Their drinks are over priced and after tonight I don&#39;t think we will be returning."

I had missed my connecting flight at O&#39;Hare Airport due to bad weather and ended up stranded in Chicago overnight. After a rough day of traveling through the Midwest and haggling with the airlines I was spent both physically and mentally. It was late at night and I was in desperate need of a shower, some food and a strong drink. The airport set me up at a Holiday Inn a few miles away. On the shuttle ride over I prayed to Jesus that the hotel bar would still be open when I arrived. My prayers were answered in resounding fashion when I got to the lobby and saw a place called Bar Louie attached to the Hotel. The place was nice and spacious, the bar was huge with plenty of open seats, there were at least 50 beers on tap, they were still serving food and the bartender kicked ass. I was in Heaven. It was the most blissful ending to a crappy day of traveling ever. I knocked down a few beers and ordered some nachos and just felt the stress of the previous day slip away with each sip. Thank you so much Bar Louie - you saved my ass and I am forever in your debt."

The bar atmosphere is nice: friendly service, clean line furnitures, quite a few TVs for sport games, basically all you would expect for a bar is there.  The pluses: a lot of local beers on tap which is definitely a nice touch. The menu is also extensive for a bar: appetizers, salads, burgers, pastas....We ordered the stockyard burger which was really good and a pear salad with added chicken.  The salad was just OK and the added chicken was coming in cube straight out of a bag, not the grilled on site kind, that was a bit disappointing.
This place definitely needs more customers and hopefully this will happen when the next door hotel opens.  Due to poor traffic, there was a couple of dissatisfiers that explains the 3 stars: cold fries and cold coffee were sent our way, and when we asked for a warm refill, the second pass was still cold. 
Hopefully will move up to a 4 stars bar when their customer base is there they sure have the potential for it."

I was very excited that we happened to stumble upon opening night last Friday, after months of anticipation.  Food was great, service was awesome, can&#39;t beat the selection of beers on tap for Mt Prospect.  I had chicken quesadillas, my husband had the Hangover Helper.  Quesadillas were very good--not hard to screw up, but plenty of places do.  The pico de gallo salsa was super fresh, which was a pleasant surprise.  The HH is a skillet of chorizo, tots, cheese, peppers, onions and 2 eggs however you want them.  He used my leftover tortilla end pieces to sop up every bit of chorizo goodness, if that tells you anything.

There are lots of TVs around the bar with sports on, but it doesn&#39;t feel like a loud sports bar because they are on mute or the volume was very low.  

This is a nice restaurant/bar with a fun atmosphere.  If I worked closer, it is the kind of place I&#39;d want to go to with coworkers on a Friday night.  I hope the next few weeks are as great as opening night was, we will definitely be back!

We asked about Happy Hour specials advertised on the menu, but they will not be rolled out until the place has been open for a month.  Our server said they *might* be adding delivery once the Holiday Inn renovations are done...dare to dream!  What?  Something besides pizza/Italian available for delivery in the NW burbs???

The beef on the Beef Chow Fun was rather chewy and somewhat large, but the noodles were cooked pretty nicely. I felt like the duck was rather dry, and the seafood combination was somewhat bland, and the seafood was like from a frozen bag.

A little more expensive than others in the area but worth it because it&#39;s delicious and they have quality ingredients. My favorites were the crab rangoon, fried shrimp, and their shrimp fried rice (I requested that they substitute the shrimp for jumbo shrimp and it was worth the extra charge). What I loved about the food was there was actually crab in the crab rangoon, the fried shrimp had more shrimp than breading, and the fried rice was flavorful without being drenched in oil and soy sauce like most chinese restaurants.  I recommend giving this restaurant a shot and I look forward to trying different items on their menu."

Sure there&#39;s good Japanese food nearby, but if I am craving some Chinese style eats I&#39;ve always come away disappointed with the offerings near my place of work. Until today when we had Mandarin Bistro deliver lunch.

I can&#39;t comment on the inside of this place, nor anything regarding how clean it is on the inside as they delivered my meal. However, they arrived right at the scheduled time so service was speedy. What I can comment on here is the food.

In trying Mandarin Bistro I decided to try two different things, an appetizer and an entree. For the appetizer I went with steamed pot stickers. These had a nice soft outside, and some good chewy meat inside. The meat had a lot of flavor and tasted great. It also came with a little cup of sauce that I didn&#39;t bother trying.

The chicken itself was a bright red color as the was the sauce it was smothered in. While there were a few rougher pieces of chicken meat in there the sauce was excellent, though not exactly spicy as the pepper next to the menu item might indicate. There were also peppers, onions, carrots, and tiny little pieces of baby cord mixed in with the sauce. Overall, this was excellent chicken and I&#39;d recommend it.

While a little on a pricey side here my overall opinion of Mandarin Bistro is quite positive. It&#39;s easily the best Chinese restaurant I&#39;ve found within delivery distance of my office and I&#39;m sure this will not be the last time we order from here. Portions were quite generous, and the taste of the food was excellent. While I had a few rougher in texture pieces of chicken and was a little disappointed by the lack of heat on this chicken I was still pleased with my meal.  I give four stars for Mandarin Bistro and a recommendation."

We generally order delivery but we&#39;ve experienced this during dine in as well. When it&#39;s good it&#39;s GREAT but when it&#39;s not, it is so NOT. The last two times we ordered the kung pao chicken was substantially different. One time it was way to hot, and I LOVE hot. But this was so hot there was no other flavor and it was not edible, I threw it out. The last time it was so gummy, it actually formed strings when I moved my fork. 

I had the same string problem with the pepper beef. It was just gross enough I fed it to the dogs.

We just tried the egg foo young and it was greasy all the way through the pattie and the sauce had no real flavor, had to add several packs of soy sauce. 

Generally the rule of thumb has been to order on the weekends since the food was the best then leading us to believe they had a different chef on weekends. We ordered this past Saturday and this was the worst its been. 

PLEASE determine what the problem is, we so want to love you again!!!!"

I decided to order the vegetable lo mein, along with an egg drop soup. Both items were delicious, and I would definitely visit on more than one occasion. My colleague also tried the restaurant for the first time just minutes after I arrived back to my office with my lunch, and he tried the Mongolian beef. He also stated that his food was excellent as well, and that their mustard sauce was made fresh on the spot. Apparently, that was something that was very important to him, as the sign of a good Chinese restaurant. 

I would definitely return, as I work within blocks of the restaurant... This seems to be my new go to Chinese restaurant, and if I lived even closer to the area, would order from them on a regular basis."

Fortune favored me.

Half an hour later, my meal arrived in the hands of the owner himself. Very shortly thereafter, I enjoyed (read: devoured) wonton soup in an unusual but tasty broth laced with lettuce; big, beautiful pork potstickers; chicken with bell peppers, carrot and bamboo shoots in a garlic-black bean sauce; textbook-perfect beef chow fun with bean sprouts; and chicken fried rice. Nothing needed further seasoning, but if it did, I could have used the blessed Kikkoman soy sauce packets, which made me stupidly happy because most other delivery comes with those horrid soy-less imposters.

We&#39;ve never seen Mango Chicken on the menu at Chinese restaurants before so we tried it a few months ago and have had it several times since. Very flavorful with juicy mango chunks, wish there were more chicken pieces though. 

Food always tastes fresh and is cooked quickly. The prices are a bit on the higher end for the quantity received. Mango chicken, chicken fried rice and 2 drinks was $30 (also came with egg drop soup which is really good, very creamy with bits of corn). Worth it every once in a while!"

Because of his new found love for Mandarin, we&#39;ve gotten takeout from here several times.  He LOVES the General Tso&#39;s Chicken.  LOVES IT!

Not delicious...just alright.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a reflection of the restaurant or simply the fact that I am just not a huge fan of this cuisine, but I just find it to be &#34;okay&#34;.

Tonight we ate in the restaurant instead of getting takeout.  The place is small, the decor is typical of an Asian restaurant (NOT modern Asian but regular Asian...you know, water fountains, bonsais, Buddhas, etc.), and the service is decent.  The prices aren&#39;t bad either.  

Overall, I would rather have me some P.F. Chang&#39;s, but this will do in a pinch."

Waited a good 40 mins for the soup while other patrons already received their food(they came in after us). Never got our soup. The pot stickers were pink! The food came right after and I advised the waitress she forgot our soup and she goes back to get it. At this time why would I want my soup when my food is here?

I work in this general area and myself and co-workers are always looking for good food.  My ever expanding waist is proof of that statement.  

Deciding to give Mandarin Bistro a try for a late dinner with a co-worker, we were more than pleasantly surprised.  First of all, the workers (owners it would seem) who greet you and wait on tables are the nicest, most customer friendly restaurant staff ever!  Warmly greeted and very friendly.

Also, the menu is HUGE.  Many selections.  They even brought out a picture menu like Denny&#39;s (they probably thought we were beginner Chinese cuisine eaters!).  

We each ordered an entree, which is served with soup.  My buddy ordered Hot and Sour soup, I ordered the Egg Drop soup.  The waitress came back and appolgized and said they were out of Hot and Sour soup.  No problem.  Egg Drop for both of us.  But, she actually scraped up a 1/2 cup of Hot and Sour soup and brought that in addition to a full cup of the Egg Drop soup.  Very nice gesture indeed!

Calling the Egg Drop soup &#34;Egg Drop&#34; is a misnomer.  This was a full flavored, chicken broth based soup, with egg, chicken, corn and other goodies.  It is delicious and like no other Egg Drop soup I have ever had.

Then the entrees came.  I had the Sizzling Beef and Onion plate (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called) and it was fabulous!  The other entree was another beef dish of some kind (with vegetables) and my friend said it was great too!

And, even though we were there late and stayed until 20 minutes after the restaurant closed, they never rushed us and we never felt hurried to leave.

The pricing was fair considering the quality of the food and the portions served.  The restaurant was super clean and had a very nice atmosphere.  Not your typical strip mall Chinese restaurant.

So, if you are looking for fantastic Chinese food at a fair price, with awesome service, visit Mandarin Bistro.  You won&#39;t be disappointed!!!!"

My friend got her coke but I waited for my smoothly.  I got my soup, my friend had to wait for her spring roll after reminding Trina again.  A Friday nite with only two other tables filled.

No one brought silverware but what the heck. Who needs silverware when there&#39;s no food.  Eventually we received soup. It was ok... nothing special. We asked for tea. Instead of a pot, someone brought two tiny cups filled with a very light colored drink... almost the color of water. But after that.. no service, no food.

I like that you can place your order online. Unfortunately for the price I was not impressed with the serving sizes or the dried out chicken in the sweet and sour chicken dish. The Kung Pao chicken was the most flavorful of the three dishes we ordered, and the Mongolian beef was ok but the meat was a bit on the chewy side. I will say the crab rangoon was pretty good and the pieces were huge, but a good appetizer does not make up for the lackluster main dish. 

We picked up our order and it smelled so good on the drive home. Between that and the menu touting them as voted one of the best 100 Chinese restaurants in the country, it made for a huge letdown once we began eating. I learned a lesson that day - if you&#39;ve already found a place you love, stick with it instead of seeking out something better. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll be ordering from Luong Loi in Wheaton from now on. They are a Vietnamese restaurant at heart but serve some seriously delicious Chinese dishes."

While the food was slightly better than average chinese restaurants, the prices were double and the portions were small. The eggrolls, which I was informed were made fresh, were very average and at $2 each not worth it. The mongolian beef was pretty good but way overpriced for what you get .

It tasted great but really missed the pepperoni.   Also need to  mention we paid for it also.  I should have checked the pizza.


Note one thing your competitor down the street does....the open the box and confirm with their customer that the pizza is correct.  Just a suggestion you should consider doing that too.

However, the first pizza we ordered seemed to have very little sauce compared to the second.  The second pizza was also different in the sense that the crust was almost soggy, and limp.

I loved the inside dimly lit.. it was romantic. Both had dinner Crepes because that is different and we would not find that at most restaurants I got their beef one and I loved it!! Was rich but still did not feel too heavy in my stomach. We started with their seafood sampler with cheeses.. very rich but I enjoyed it! Again different from what we usually eat but good. I also had their Cucumber Martini which I LOVED! so refreshing.  Then just had a glass of their blanc to blanc just because I love bubbly and knew that would be all I would drink that night. It was also very refreshing and crisp. One of the better Blanc de blancs I have tried.

Overpriced and lacking the flavor you would expect for a high-end French restaurant. We&#39;ve been here twice; once for dinner and once for breakfast - both times were sadly somewhat disappointing. It&#39;s a shame, the owner is very nice.

It really comes down to the high price tag for flavorless food. Walking in you get super excited because the vibe inside is great. Plating, service, and decor are all exceptional. However, my wife and I were both amazed at the blandness of the food. After our first visit, we thought maybe it was just an off night for the kitchen, but we came back again and left equally disappointed.

In a nutshell, I suggest finding another place where your money can buy you much more developed flavors. Epicure leaves a lot to be desired in this category. It&#39;s certainly not cheap either.

Also, big FYI - the pastry they offer you during breakfast is NOT free! It&#39;s $3.95 and they don&#39;t tell you unless you specifically ask. Can&#39;t imagine the shock later for the table of 8 next to us who all took the waiter up on that fine looking pastry..."
epicure-bistro-barrington,Laura D.,e2_cdCS_598xZhIMJAHQTw,"McHenry, IL",0,1,0,99,38,EkH6o0lOBSiTcFQZFdjKOg,5.0,2016-01-20,"I recently moved up to the McHenry area from Louisiana but hail from a Parisian home. Being quite homesick, I&#39;ve been on the hunt for a good French restaurant and have been disappointed by many of the places I visited. I wouldn&#39;t give up though... my anniversary was coming up and I wanted us to try one more. That&#39;s when I saw Epicure Bistro on Yelp. I didn&#39;t read the reviews but went straight to the menu to see how authentic it was. The menu is really inviting and has a great variety of dishes. We decided to give it a shot.

We visited it today. The parking lot was empty and the tables were vacant but they were still open. It was perfect in my opinion since I don&#39;t like crowded locations. It picked up a little after we arrived but it still kept a nice quiet atmosphere. The tables are nice and spacious, the booths are large and able to seat anyone of any size. The waitress was kind and wonderful. She was on point, she would check on us but not too frequently which was perfect. You know those overly bubbly waiters/waitresses that constantly check on you... yeah, she wasn&#39;t that. She was perfect for the atmosphere. 

We started with drinks. I had their margarita and my boyfriend had the 007. The margarita was by far one of the best ones I have drank in a long time. I am a bit of a margarita nut and taste and compare them wherever I travel to. This one ranks as the top for Illinois and in the top 5 for all the states I&#39;ve been to (which is 27). The 007, also known as The Vesper, is exactly how James Bond describes it in Casino Royale. It&#39;s potent, it&#39;s bold, and it&#39;s refreshing. Definitely a great pairing for the foods we were about to consume. 

The pate is about as authentic as you can get it here. There are many locations that claim they have &#34;pate&#34; but all they hand out is chicken liver paste. The pate here is succulent and comes in the traditional duck form. The assortment of cheeses you can have are so traditionally French it brought me home. The breads taste handmade and have that rustic flavor to them. The French Onion Soup is done the way my mom makes it, with a good layer of oil and the onions cooked to a slight golden color before being put into the broth. The salty/sweet version is Americanized. A traditional Onion Soup is usually oily and savory. In France they use it as a natural cleanser and a way to rid your body of toxins. This reminded me of the ones I grew up with.

My boyfriend went for the Mahi Mahi and I had the Pork Chop. The risotto he had was cooked to perfection and paired perfectly with the sauce. The pork, apple, and sauce on my plate were so good by themselves... but magical when eaten all together. The portions were actually decent for the price too. My pork chop was a hearty portion that I had to bring some home with me. My boyfriend cleaned his plate. 

For dessert we had the Bisou, the crepe with lemon curd and meringue. It tasted fresh and clean. The crepe was well executed and reminded me of the ones my mom would make for our New Year&#39;s tradition. A perfect way to end our night. 

All in all, I was impressed. This is the one place that is getting thumbs up from me! I definitely plan on returning. Most likely during the middle of the week right around rush hour as to avoid the crowds. The only problem I had was the music selection... I would have preferred classic French alternative but they have live music on the weekends."

The hostess is an extremely charming young lady and our waiter was very attentive.  We had French onion soup and a chilled mango soup concoction.  The French onion soup was a little to bland for my husbands taste but a good does of salt and black pepper made it more tasty for him. By the time I  was half way through my mango soup, my taste buds began to enjoy this odd soup more and more.   When our crepes arrived we were very anxious to enjoy their anticipated scrumptiousness but we were somewhat let down. My husband&#39;s Beef Bourguignon crepe was just ok and I thought my L&#39;Alaskan salmon crepe was very dry.  The stars of this restaurant was indeed the hostess and waiter but alas that is not the reason someone goes to a restaurant for.  We did not have dessert there but instead headed next door and both got tasty treats at the bakery to go home and enjoy.  No we do not anticipate that we will be returning to eat here."

I suppose they have their good days and bad days, star chef on days and star chef off days, smart waiters working and disgruntled waiting to be fired.  Look to the predominance of opinion.

The nutella dessert crepe was out of this world.

My six-year-old kept &#34;yum, yum&#34;-ing after every bite. We all really enjoyed it. The place was relatively hopping for a Wednesday night, too, and it&#39;s nice to feel like you&#39;re not dining in an empty restaurant.

Just a few things that could&#39;ve made the experience perfect - bread could be warm, leak sauce in crepe could&#39;ve been creamier, and frites seemed a little breaded (kind of like BK). All in all, everything was really tasty and we&#39;ll definitely be back."

First of all, this is NOT a bistro...it&#39;s a creperie!! The vast majority of the menu is crepes and sandwiches...no true entrees! A true French bistro would offer things like steak frites and roast chicken....French comfort foods. The only entrees offered (other than crepes) are on a daily specials menu that the waiter gives you when you sit down. The specials are WAY overpriced...seriously, $36 for an 8 oz filet?? $34 for a lamb shank? They also offered a &#34;cassoulet&#34; (again, overpriced), but stated that it was in a marinara sauce??? I&#39;m sorry, but cassoulet does not have a marinara sauce. That&#39;s Italian NOT French.

We decided instead to get a couple of appetizers and try the crepes. The charcuterie plate had two pates and two cheeses along with some grapes, cornichons, and olives. It was served with a couple pieces of toasted bread. The duck pate was decent, but the lamb pate had a funky flavor that was very off-putting. The cheeses were excellent, especially the petit basque. 

We also got the crab cakes, which were tasty, but a small portion for the $14 they charge. 

I ordered the Cajun crepe and  my husband got the Normandie, which had beef tips in a gravy. His was delicious, mine was ok...not really a Cajun sauce. The shrimp were small and didn&#39;t taste fresh and the &#34;wild&#34; mushrooms were nothing but sautéed button mushrooms. The Andouille sausage in the crepe was very tasty, however. 
The highlight of our meal were the French fries! They were crispy and delicious! They came with a side of ketchup. When I asked the waitress for a side of aioli instead to dip my fries, she had no idea what I was talking about. Disappointing. 

The sandwiches looked good and some tables next to us had ordered them. But my husband and I had come here for a nice bistro dinner and that was lacking. I would recommend this place for a nice lunch, but was sadly disappointed about the lack of dinner options and the overpriced entrees!"

My wife and I ate here with our son for the first time.  It was previously Barrington Bistro, a great place.  
The staff was very welcoming from the get go.  The owner was there getting to know the new customers and was very pleasant.   The inside has been completely remodeled and reconfigured all in a tasteful and hip manner that works well.  The menu is fun including lots of unique things plus a great kids section.  
They have only been open a few nights and all went very smooth.
The food was wonderful and a great value.
We highly recommend this place."

The food and atmosphere made the experience wonderful. Our server, Courtney, gave great commendations. We tried the shrimp and crab cakes on her recommendation and they were a great start. I highly recommended La Cajun crepes and La Bourguignone crepes. Really, I can&#39;t imagine any of the crepes being a disappointment. We had the desert on special, a chocolate almond cake with chocolate mousse, also, delicious. The wine selection, as well as a fairly extensive cocktail menu, just rounded out the great experience. We will definitely be visiting again!"

We visited last evening with friends and are extremely disappointed and will not re-visit.  The charm of their former restaurant in Woodstock is non-existent and the sophistication and well-versed servers of the former Barrington Bistro is absent. The restaurant was half or more empty which does not lend Itself to a fun dining experience. One menu is used for brunch, lunch (sandwiches), dinner, and limited wine list. Our server had no recommendations for wines as she said &#34;I don&#39;t drink&#34;. Huh?  She did not bring the owner over to discuss wine pairings. She giggled throughout the entire time she served us and it was disconcerting. No one supervised her. A separate sheet with daily specials was provided but it was not referred to by the server and she did not appear to have knowledge about the menu. Clearly, untrained. We all ordered the crepes and nothing special.  Although I was still eating, server attempted to remove my plate. A negative experience with the server and a bland dinner. 
I would only return for lunch and only if others wanted to try the restaurant. I do not recommend."

I immediately liked the atmosphere-nice but not pretentious, with tables spaced far enough apart that you don&#39;t feel cramped. The food was great! I had the beef bourgingnon (I&#39;m sure I spelled that wrong) crepes, and my boyfriend had the paella, which was a French twist on a a traditional. Loved them both. The dressings on the salads were similarly inventive and wonderful. And they have gluten free crepes by the way, which were light and tasty. Lastly, dessert-we shared a bananas foster crepe -yum! And they had a wonderful hot tea selection. All for very reasonable prices. This place is now on our go-to list."

It was a genuinely pleasant surprise.  We had been told it was primarily a crepes restaurant, but in fact, it is really so much more.  With 4 people we were able to try
3 appetizers:  cheese plate, escargot, and crab and shrimp cakes, all very tasty.  Even before the appetizers, we were served really scrumptious warm dinner roles with butter . . . those alone would make me recommend the place!  We had the Country Crepe, the Normandy and the Parisienne . . . they were all good, but the Parisienne had a particularly great flavor.  We split 2 desserts, the profiteroles, a standard choice for a French restaurant,
and a crepe with ice cream, chocolate hazelnut sauce and fruit . . . really good!  We really miss the Barrington Bistro, but the Epicure Bistro is a wonderful addition to the Barrington dining scene! We plan to return and we would recommend to other diners. As an addendum, the staff is helpful and very pleasant and friendly. Welcome to Barrington, Epicure Bistro."

The decor is very plain and the prices are a bit high for the combination of food, ambiance, location and service.

delicia-tropical-cafe-elgin,Elizabeth B.,92aV0kRixTW5_q4GK8vNaw,"Elgin, IL",0,1,0,0,2,TnKHcKwd15jBQteeYbLU1A,5.0,2016-11-23,"Come visit Elgin! A contemporary mix of history, growth and inclusion. Founded in 1836 its current  population is just over 108,000.  The large city is diverse, yet overwhelmingly saturated with Hispanic culture. Whether you drive, bike or walk the streets of Elgin, there is a notable Latino presence. Making up the majority of the minority population, Mexican Americans in this city have the lion&#39;s share of the ethnic food market. Despite that only 2.49% of the city is culturally familiar with its cuisine, Delicia Tropical Cafe (Delicia) is a jewel amongst pebbles. Oddly set on a thoroughfare in Elgin next to an automobile repair shop and sharing a 15 spot asphalt parking lot with a single story 40 unit motel, Delicia is a Puerto Rican casual dine-in carry-out restaurant. If you&#39;re tired of the brutal traffic on your road trips, three or four times a month, to dine at Puerto Rican restaurants in &#34;the city&#34; you might want to explore a closer options. 

I discovered Delicia several years ago while scouring the, at the time underdeveloped, internet. Unfamiliar with the city of Elgin, but desperate for a closer but similar restaurant, we decided to give Delicia a shot. 

I was skeptical and here&#39;s why, upon entering the full glass commercial entry door, the entire public area of the restaurant can be seen. The walls, covered with a deep red paint are separated from the barely 9&#39; ceilings by a black soffit. Underfoot, you&#39;re greeted with cream ceramic tile that leads to industrial gray carpet. With its completely Hispanic staff and Latin music blaring from sporadically placed overhead speakers, it&#39;s clear from the moment you enter that you&#39;ve crossed the threshold of an ethnic restaurant.

Never described as an adventurous eater, and even less adventurous when trying new restaurants; I visited Delicia with much skepticism. Not one for mom-and-pop shops, I sat in the sparse restaurant and perused the pictured menu for a familiar feast. As a non-Hispanic who has grown fond of Latin food; I decided to try familiar dishes that I routinely ordered at my usual Puerto Rican restaurant in the city; a steak jibarito, arroz con gandules, with a side of beef pastelillo.  Every bite taken was scrutinized for its divergence from what I had grown to know as Puerto Rican food. I left that first dining experience, in 2007, unimpressed. 

In the months that followed desperation got the best of us, my husband and I visited Delicia on a monthly basis. Still comparing the offerings, we noticed a subtle evolution. The more we visited Delicia the better the food seemed. Over time we were inviting friends and family to dine with us. 

Several months later, we arrived Sunday midday, to an overflowing parking lot and a restaurant packed with patrons. Inside, all eight seats at the diner like bar near the entrance were taken. The adjacent row of chairs were nearly full with guests waiting for their carry-out order. The dining room&#39;s banquettes and steel based wood laminate topped mobile tables were filled with bodies laughing and joyfully conversing. It felt like we were invading a private party. Small four-person tables were pushed together to form long banquet like tables. Banquettes overflowed, chairs pulled up at their end to provide extra seating. Servers floated within the room carrying trays of steaming hot food from the bustling kitchen, it was an orchestrated madhouse. 

Finally seated and served, I dined and took in my surroundings. As I looked around and listened, I saw and heard happiness. Despite that the only English conversation taking place was at my table, the translation of others was clear. Mothers and fathers fed their children, old friends enjoyed each other&#39;s company, and multigenerational families came together. In spite of America&#39;s push to eat healthier, people where literally waiting in line to get their hands on Delicia&#39;s fried, savory, Puerto Rican cuisine. It was clear in that moment that we weren&#39;t patrons at a regular restaurant, we were experiencing a foreign culture, a culture that revolved around its own food, a culture that loved its food, that loved its family, that loved its friends, and loved that it could so readily have a piece of island life in the city. 

Years later, and now residents of Elgin, we visit Delicia exclusively to retrieve carry-out. Delicia offers unique ethnic food in a casual laid back atmosphere. Delicia stands as a cultural yoke for Puerto Rican families in the city of Elgin where friends and families mix, mingle, catch up, and multiple generations come to reminisce over the food of their ancestors. For the foreign diner, it&#39;s a taste of an exotic cuisine that they will surely never forget."

Personally, I didn&#39;t care too much for the food. It didn&#39;t taste bad, but everything was soooooooo fried, I could barely handle it. They have fresh guava juice, but its so loaded with sugar, it made me feel heavy and full. Ugh. I just felt bored with the food.

We have Puerto Rican family members, and have never been able to find food like they make. This is so good. 

The stews were hearty. The plantain sandwich was dense and the combination of textures is addictive. The Tripolini sandwich was excellent and the steak was great.

The rice and beans was a little dry, and not the traditional - with kidney beans and potatoes. But still pretty good."

Entering we waited at the counter for 10 minutes to be seated. 5 servers and a counter person kept walking past us without a hello or anything. The menu is confusing. The prices are moderate but the food isn&#39;t very good. We split a pastelli and pasteligo .Both were mediocre. We split a shrimp wrapped in Chicken covered in cheese.  Then wrapped in bacon.

Now onto the food: we ordered that Cuban and it didn&#39;t disappoint.  It wasn&#39;t at all greasy and the meat was fresh and juicy. We also ordered the bistec with onions which came out timely and was really pretty on the plate. The rice that came with it was good with the olive in it.

This seems to be fairly a small place with some decent decor and family-run restaurant and there was just one person helping with the seating and taking orders, so kinda was a little-slow service but very very friendly. We were given a complementary plate of bread - which was uhmm.. not really THAT fresh but hey we were hungry souls.

We were just two of us, we started off with Platanutres - thinly fried plantain chips - which was soo good.. Reminded us of the Indian Banana Chips, we got a Cola Champaigna - cream soda, which was pretty good too something similar to some of our local sodas. We then ordered the Tilapia Al ajilio - which was baked fish with some veggies and garlic butter sauce, got with a side of mfongos (mashed/seasonded plantain) - both were good and was heavy. Also got the jibarito o&#39;chicago with chicken (plantain sandwich - instead of bread deep fried plantain) - this was yummy .. Really good..!!

Only complaints were - complementary bread was cold and hard, LOT OF PLANTAINS :p.. 

But overall really enjoyed the food I was given :)

P.S. Probably difficult with someone who is veg - none of the entrees/sandwiches were vegetarian I think.. Though of course you can remove the meat I suppose.. x)"

A lot of people have called Delicia a &#34;gem&#34;, and it really is a perfect word.

The food is very authentic, and if you need suggestions, the servers are extremely helpful. Unbelievable mofungo, tostones, and pasteles that remind my mom of her ancestors (a huge compliment). We&#39;ve even had some items that we&#39;d never heard of before, and we have yet to be disappointed.
The flan is not to be missed, either, and this menu is so affordable that it&#39;s pretty much a sin if you don&#39;t order dessert.

I guess it was good because she&#39;s only 5. She ate some arroz con gandules on my request but my son ate a lot of it. Mine was really good. I had Pechuga de pollo rellena de camarones con pimonte sauce with sweet plantains on the side. Empanadas were ok but I&#39;ve had lots of great ones my mom and aunts made.

It&#39;s authentic and delicious and tastes just like the home cooking. My only complaint is the guy in his mid-20s that works there, pretty sure it&#39;s his family that owns the place, can be a little standoffish sometimes. Very obvious that he cares more about the money side of things. But the rest of the staff/owners there are wonderful and very friendly. I recommend this place to anyone, especially if you&#39;re missing that home cooked meal."

Honestly, walking in i really didn&#39;t expect much, but the lobster with criolla sauce was really delightful. The olives in the puerto rican rice kicked the flavour up a notch!

Drove two hours to eat here and will gladly do it again soon. Amazing food, killer flan, and an atmosphere like you&#39;re going over to your best friends house who just happens to be a stellar cook and host. 

Had the mofongo with shrimp, which was crazy amazing btw. I even picked up the dish of sauce and then drank it like tea without caring who saw me. Don&#39;t judge. 

And I could not leave without having a dish of flan (better than your mama makes) and a cup of coffee. 

Denny, an owner, waited on us and was excellent.

Some of the best tostones I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m not Puerto Rican. But one of my friends is, and SHE also swears these are some of the best tostones she&#39;s ever had. So I&#39;m not on crack, yay! :D

Ridiculously great sandwiches. I had the criollo de pollo. My aforementioned friend had the jibarito de pollo (which I wanted, but she ordered it first, so I got something else). My SO ordered the tripleta. 

Puerto Rican rice was a little heavy on the olives, but completely tasty. They even serve Coco Rico and other PR drinks! 

I&#39;m hoping I have room for dessert next time. As it was, my SO had to take half of his tripleta home -- still can&#39;t believe that sandwich was under $7. It was huge, stuffed with meat, and delicious. 

Will definitely nom again. So happy a PR place of this quality is out in the &#39;burbs!"

Bacalaito completely missed the mark with just dough and no bacalao you may as well call it a blind bacalaito aka &#34;ito&#34;.

If it&#39;s your first time trying Puerto Rican food, go for it. It&#39;s worth trying and they do great. The service is a little slow but they&#39;re extremely nice here. The place is very comfortable with some very nice art work on the walls. Definitely not a fancy place to eat but most great places aren&#39;t. 

I can&#39;t say this place is the best food I&#39;ve ever had. This place is okay and when I&#39;m craving a jibarito with some tostones or some chuletas and arroz con gandules it fixes the craving. It&#39;ll definitely do the job especially if you&#39;re like me, living in the suburbs and are craving for it but don&#39;t want to drive all the way to Chicago for it.

I have never had PR food before, ever... and a friend who had explained how they roast this and that and the plantains yada...all this while I was practically DRINKING their salad dressing and chowing on the fried plantains with the same dressing. Yes, I smelled like garlic for two days, but it was completely worth it.  

I got the roasted pork mufongo which comes w/ soup or salad (salad drsg - the bomb!) and we ordered an extra order of the fried plantains so I could take home to the hubs. It was so much food that I had two meals out of the leftovers.  My husband was impressed with the flavor. My boss, whom I got the same but chicken, was not impressed -- she said the chicken was dry, which it was and flavorless. NOTE: she did not realize she had to use the broth to moisten up the plantain mash etc. 

I drove past last Thursday night on my way to Bartlett and noticed it was EMPTY. I hope that this is not a sign of things to come.  According to the manager/owner he said many catering orders were going out, which is good. 

BTW, atmosphere in the restaurant is very plain and nothing spectacular. Focus on the food... the bathrooms were clean. (this is important!)"

When I found myself in Elgin, I made a stop.  What a delicious experience!  In addition to the mofungo, my girlfriend and I tried the aranitas and a bori-cuba sandwhich (a Cuban sandwich on plantain slices).  My friends, you *must* try the aranitas--they are like hash browns, but they are made out of plantains and served with a garlic mayo sauce.  Absolutely brilliant.

The mofungo was exactly what I remembered from Puerto Rico, and the bori-cuba sandwich was delicious in its simplicity.

The service is generally attentive, though this past time I had to remind my waiter of several things (e.g., refilling water).  One of the waitresses there always speaks to us in Spanish even though she can speak English.  (I don&#39;t speak Spanish very well.)  All the servers are friendly, though.

I went with 2 others last night after googling PR restaurants. We were surprised to see one pop up in Elgin, and decided to give it a try since it was by far the closest. (We spent all afternoon staring at the menu, starving ourselves for the feast to come)

The neighborhood is a little skechy, but isn&#39;t that where you find the best food sometimes? 
Small parking lot and directly on the main street, so it&#39;s easy to find. 

Upon entering, we all looked at each other with empty stomachs and agreed that the place just smelled delicious already. We were excited.
The server (can&#39;t remember his name, but there only seemed to be two present) was friendly, helpful and must&#39;ve thought we were Puerto Rican because he was rambling off spanish like we were from the islands. Good thing we could keep up :) 

We ordered several items, all of which were absolutely homemade and delicious. A LOT of food for 3 hungry girls. But that&#39;s how we roll. 

[DRINKS]
Kola Champagne all around. Yum. Looks like Cola but tastes like Cream Soda. And straight from Puerto Rico. 

[APPETIZERS]
1) Tostones - huge, double-fried, drizzled with a garlic oil and served with a mayo-ketchup dipping sauce. Hot, freshly made and delicious! 
2) Pastelillos - we ordered one beef and one cheese. Again, delicious. I loved the beef filling and could eat maybe 3 of those as a meal. 

[ENTREES] (all came with a pretty good, fairly large side salad)
1) Pernil y Arroz Blanco con Habichuelas Rojas - This was my entree and I was completely happy with it. I&#39;ve had delicious homemade pernil before, and this didn&#39;t disappoint. Perfectly seasoned, on the salty side, which I love. The habichuelas... omg... Can I have a bowl of just that with rice please? They were so, so good and comforting! 
2) Pechuga con Salsa Criolla y Arroz con Gandules- I had a bite to taste and it was flavorful. The chicken was a bit overcooked (fried), and without the salsa would&#39;ve been too dry. Altogether though, pretty good. Arroz con gandules - YUM! 
3) Mofongo con Camarones Al Ajillo - I was too busy with my Pernil to taste this one, but my sis thoroughly enjoyed it and got her mofongo fix. 

[DESSERTS]
1) Flan - One of our all-time fave desserts. This one didn&#39;t disappoint. 
2) Tembleque - Um, are we IN Puerto Rico? We felt like it when we took a bite of this delicious coconut custard pudding. SO. GOOD. 

We used a restaurant.com Gift Certificate... but I almost felt bad using such a discount on such delicious food. The service was great too - friendly and helpful. Total came to about $30 after the gift cert.... A STEAL for this food. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back, and recommend it to everyone. I&#39;m determined to get people to this place so that they never close down. Already getting a big group to go back! 

Go. Eat delicious food. Enjoy my favorite salsa songs in the background. Support this authentic spot deep in the burbs. They deserve it."

Prices were reasonable, service was much better, and the quality of the food was consistently amazing. We went 2-3 times per month all the way from DeKalb Co and for special family celebrations several times per year as well. 

Under new owners the prices soared, service has tanked, and food quality has gone down and is no longer consistent. We stopped eating here for about 6 months because of a series of really bad experiences, but finally tried it again a couple times this spring and had better experiences (still not great, but enough that I was willing to give you another chance). Tonight is the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back so to speak.  Posted hours are until 9pm and we arrived at 7:45pm. After waiting about 5 minutes for staff to even acknowledge us standing there waiting, we were very rudely told that the dining room is closed and that they were only doing takeout. When we called them on their rudeness they snootily said that we could stay and eat this time but that we should have called ahead like their other customers and he would&#39;ve told us the dining room was closed. We ended up leaving as we were so off-put by the WORST(!!) customer service we&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant. Ended up at another restaurant where they were pleasant and happy for our business. 

A couple suggestions: a) change your posted hours online and on your door if you&#39;re closing over an hour earlier than posted or if takeout is open later than the dining room; b) get some hospitality/customer service training - you could&#39;ve said things nicely in one of a million ways (such as, &#34;I&#39;m sorry folks, but we&#39;re short staffed this evening and we had to close the dining room early, but we&#39;d be happy to cook you some great food to bring home&#34; or &#34;sure, have a seat and we&#39;ll be right with you. Just so you know for next time, we recently changed our policy and now the dining room closes at 745pm but since we&#39;re still in the process of changing our posted hours we&#39;re happy to serve you later than normal tonight.&#34;) instead of treating potential paying customers like crap. 

Really sad to write you off, but I&#39;m not wiling to pay to be disrespected like that. If that&#39;s what I was looking for I&#39;d head to Ed Debevick&#39;s where at least they&#39;re funny and only pretending to be awful to customers."

The pork, chicken, and mofongo dishes were delish. And the puerto rican rice and fried plantains? Muy bueno!

Top off your meal with the coconut ice cream. It&#39;s really not an ice cream per se, but more of a shaved ice texture. Whatever it was, I&#39;ll definitely be going back to Delicia over and over again!"

The place is in a seedier end of Elgin than I would desire but is far from worry-some and inside looked really nice!!!   (another customer commented about their recent remodel)

So back to not understanding their menu, we ordered all of their frittas appetizers.  There are 5 of them, they are a buck fifty each, we received 4 (and accurately billed as such)...  I can&#39;t tell you what was what but they were a steal for the price and damn tasty.

We had salads that (while I am not a fan in any way shape or form) had some of the reddest, ripest tomatoes I had ever seen.

For the main course,  I&#39;m not even sure what I ordered!  something about fried plantains that are turned into mashed potatoes  and steak with vegetables  (the best I can tell you was it began with an &#39;M&#39;).   The fried plantains mashed potatoes is probably more ethnic a texture than I will understand.  The steak cut is very thin and seemed a bit overcooked.  The topped peppers and onions were the absolute perfect thickness and major props for that.  And it was over a very watery &#34;salsa&#34;.  I don&#39;t think I understood how to properly eat it but I did very much enjoy it.

My date had one of their seared shrimp in garlic butter with vegetables and Spanish rice. That was a damn good dish!

Oh and they had my favorite soda: Good Cola&#39;s Cola Champaign....  mmmmmm.  

To overview the experience,  the neighborhood is a bit off-putting and I don&#39;t think they are accustomed to clients ordering in english (so some order shortings but the billing was accurate), but I really enjoyed my experience there and will certainly be back again!  And the pricing was fantastic,  2 people ordering twice the amount of food they should have totalled to 32.25....  Thumbs up!"

Tostones- good texture, good sauce, but definitely needed to be salted, not such a bad thing because I like to control the amount of salt I used.

mofongo with fried pork- flavor city, the pork was delicious- some parts a little too dry, but still delicious. the mofongo was garlicky and had enough chicharron for texture, and I really liked the broth. portions were good, we had a lot of leftovers.

Service was good, they were all very nice and helpful, and they have carafes of water. More restaurants need to bust out carafes for water!"

They have GREAT service and are willing to answer questions and make recommendations of what to order. I thought their rice and beans (pinto beans) were spiced perfectly and the Pechuga al Ajilo (garlic chicken) was very good. I think this restaurant is a good value and overall I had a great experience. I can&#39;t wait to go back to try more.

Update: We catered from this restaurant and it was fantastic. You could not beat the price, the food, and we ordered the perfect amount of food. The owner was super helpful and dead on with how much food to get. I can&#39;t say enough about this place, I love it!"

Now, being born and raised my whole life in Chicago i have experienced most of the Puerto Rican restuarants in and around Chicago/humbolt park area.  I also have been to Puerto Rico this past year and i can say that Delicia is one of the best, if not the best Puerto Rican food i have ever had (Besides my Wife&#39;s of course :) )

I have been here a few times now and the food has never disappointed me.  As hard as it is to find mofongo, Delicia&#39;s is perfect and the best i have ever had.  The Pernil was juicy and very flavorful and was perfect with the mofongo.  
The Jibarito is great as well, the steak is very tender and again, the best jibarito i have ever had (Sorry Borinquen).  
Now the rice (Arroz Con Gandules), is the best i have had from a restaurant.  Very traditional and perfect.  

VERY good cafe con leche and i must say the service was very good the few times i have been there.

I really hope Delicia stays around for a long time, now that i live out in the burbs i dont have to drive to the city to get my PR food fix.  

The owner takes great pride in his restaurant and reading the stories on the wall about him, made the whole experience even better."

We have tried La Boriquen and Boriquen Lounge in the city and we by far say the jibaritos is much better in the city than elgin. Our food took forever to be served and we were just left there with only bread and butter. Then when the food arrived it only comes with just the sandwich when in other restaurants with rice. If you ask you rice they charge you an extra 3$ and in my opinion that&#39;s really overpriced for a jibarito meal. It came out to be 8.25 in the end which is very overpriced than the restaurants in the city and they include rice. I would not recommend this place. Sorry.

Then I find Delicia Tropical.  I&#39;ve had carry-out from this restaurant on a number of occasions.  Each time, the food has been decent.  Not the best Puerto Rican food, but certainly good enough and without the 5 hour flight to San Juan.  

Good mofongo.  Rice and beans with that very specific Puerto Rican flavor.  And I&#39;ve also had a couple excellent chicken and beef dishes as well.  

The area around this restaurant is a little seedy, but it is definitely worth the visit in my opinion."

my sandwich was a very thin chicken cutlet with a very small piece of lettuce and a very thinly cut tomato slice cut in half.... instead of bread I chose the fried plantain as the bun which was most of the sandwich... very starchy with little to nothing as far as sandwich filling....

My daughter also chose the plantain bunned Cuban sandwich which once again was light on the meats, cheese and pickles....

My wife got the chicken and rice soup which she said had great flavor and once again this dish came with fried plantains which were in all plates a majority of what the dishes consisted of.... with a side of mixxed catsup and mayo for all...."

My husband and I just returned from a trip to Puerto Rico and were missing the food.  We searched Puerto Rican restaurants and found this one close by.  We called, and they do take reservations, although they are not always needed.  They asked that if you bring a larger party that you call ahead to reserve a table.  They also said that you can bring your own favorite alcoholic beverages if you like.

We started off with the pastelillos -- one chicken and one beef.  My favorite was the beef -- the seasoning was just like the ones in Puerto Rico.  We moved onto the bistec en salsa and camarones en salsa criolla:  beef in a tomato sauce with onions and peppers and shrimp prepared similarly.  We both got the rice and beans with sausage.  Absolutely fantastic and I&#39;m not a fan of white rice!!  The portions were so big that we each took home half of our meal and are enjoying it during the week.

Dessert was just as pleasing -- we tried both the flan and the coconut custard.  Delicious!!

It was also fun that the staff came over to talk to us.  We shared stories of Puerto Rico, and they told us some very interesting history and other places to go to if we ever get that return trip in.  There was pleasant salsa music playing in the background.  Everyone was very pleasant, service was excellent, and the food came out fast (we had become accustomed to waiting a lot longer in PR).  

We&#39;re eager to share this restaurant with friends and will be coming back."

First off, walking into this tiny old diner building I was greeted by the aroma of roasted meats and garlic. I had the kind of feeling you get as a hungry kid, when your friend&#39;s mom is making dinner and you are really hoping they will invite you to stay.
We used a restaurants.com gift certificate so we ordered alot for 2 people. I had the garlic shrimp mofongo (amazing but so loaded with garlic that its for extreme garlic die-hards... You&#39;ll be tasting it the next day, trust me). My husband ordered a roast pork platter with  hot broth. Tender with lots of flavor. The fried plantains rock but not as much as the tostones fried dough with meat or cheese. That can&#39;t be healthy, but that&#39;s not why we eat out, right? Also we had dinner salads with the house dressing (a zesty version of thousand island), and a side of Puerto Rican rice (made authentic with pigeon peas and olives), which was mild and filling. 
I want to go back for the soup and a sandwich (which combined only costs around $7). I only regret ordering the kola champagne soft drink. While having a pleasant aroma of cream soda with distinct notes of rose petals, at 52g of sugar I could actually feel it drilling holes into my teeth. We shared that nevertheless.
So, for cheap authentic eats, check this place out!"

The rice was a big ol&#39; mountain of deliciousness, so I recommend splitting it with your compañero. I also suggest getting two sandwiches for yourself, so you can eat one now and take the other one home. We chowed on the &#34;Cubano&#34; sandwich and really liked it despite feeling guilty for eating Cuban food at a Puerto Rican restaurant.

We had the amarillas (fried plantains), the bacalaito (fried cod fish fritter), pastelillo de pollo (chicken turnovers).  MMMMM!!!!  The daughter and the grandkiddos didn&#39;t like the texture of the plantains, but loved the flavor.  

The entrees were pechuga al ajillo and mofongo - both were chicken sauted in garlic butter with onions and red and green bell peppers.  MMMMMM!!!

My usual go to for that is Bosna Grill but they close (sometimes even before time) at 8 pm.  Using the Yelp app I found a place still open and placed an order by phone.  Twenty minutes later I was driving up and down Elmhurst road trying to find this place.  Yelp shows that it&#39;s on Elmhurst but in a location near the overpass of I-90.  But, the address is all wrong then.  A quick call to the grill and I was back on track.

Pulling up to the place, it seemed typical.  In that, places like this in Chicago tend to draw the attention of men of all kinds.  It&#39;s known that an attractive Eastern European woman will most likely tend bar.  Booze will be available and at some point Euro will hit the airwaves.  Who doesn&#39;t like the attention of a pretty lady?  And she was mighty pretty.

I ordered a beef burek and cevapi.  I like their burek, the meat seemed to have flavor as if sauteed a bit before it was stuffed and baked.  The cevapi was nice as well, ample amount of soft cheese served with two halves of that fluffy Yugoslavian style bread with a hearty portion of beef links, tomato slices and chopped onions.  (I kind of prefer the long slices to the tiny chopped kind.)  With a shortie bottle of Cockta, I paid somewhere around fifteen and a half dollars.

(I still miss you Chef!) Anyway, after some scheduling discussion a date was set to meet up with my Balkan food guides--Dalibor and Ericka. They know there stuff! 

Euro Grill is a simple, yet sleek set up. There&#39;s a bar, table seating for about 15, and a medium sized flat screen that played Balkan music videos all evening. 

The menu is small, offering meat dishes, some salads, Burek and soups. I was there for Cevapi and to try the Cheese Burek. The Cevapi was delicious. Mildly spiced beef sausages served on warm fluffy lepijna bread. There&#39;s onions and tomato and a sour cream cheese on the side to add to it. And to hear my toddler son say &#34;More Cevapi please&#34; was music to my ears. The Cevapi was so good, I should have ordered one to go because I could have easily had the same thing for lunch the next day. 

The Burek unfortunately was forgotten so it got overdone. Very crispy, it was just ok, but I&#39;m willing to come back and try it again. Now I have never been to the Balkans but my dining companions laughed when the Burek came out well-done. Evidently, what he remembers of eating back in home was that Burek is almost always forgotten because the cooks are busy with the main dishes/meats. So seeing a well-done Burek was not uncommon for him. I dunno, can&#39;t explain it, but if you&#39;ve got restaurant cooks doing the same thing home cooks are doing, It kind of made me feel like a guest at someone&#39;s home instead of a small restaurant.

To make up for the well-done Burek, the owner came out and apologized and showered my son with packages of cookies. The cookies were unnecessary but it was still a very nice gesture.  A great place. I&#39;ll be back soon."

They used to be located at another small shopping strip in Des Plaines, but a couple years ago they closed down (as did Chef&#39;s Corner in Naperville) and I couldn&#39;t get Cevapi in the Suburbs. I had to trek it all the way to Chicago. And you&#39;re probably thinking, &#34;Tough shit,&#34; right? My Grandpa&#39;s response to saying meat was overcooked and tough was always, &#34;It&#39;s tougher where there isn&#39;t any.&#34; Well, for about a year there wasn&#39;t a single Cevapi place within 20 miles of home. Let&#39;s just say that was a very dark time for me.

Euro Grill is now located in Rayyan Plaza III, which is a small shopping center on the east side of Elmhurst Rd between Algonquin &amp; Dempster. If you blink you might miss it, but I hope you find it. It&#39;s definitely worth it. Everything has been upgraded. I liked the old place because it was small and cozy; however, the newer place is bright and open. They have tons of seating now and the menu has expanded a little bit.

The food could be described as &#34;Balkan&#39;s Best.&#34; They have Cevapi, which are seasoned minced meat sausages served atop a pillowy Lepinja (fluffy Balkan pita-style bread) with a side of diced onions, tomatoes and Kajmak (a buttery sour spread). You can also get Pljeskavica (Balkan-style Burger) or a stuffed Pljeskavica with cheese. If you can&#39;t make up your mind then go with Mijesano Meso (Mixed Meat). If you want something a little less messy then you can grab yourself a meat-filled Burek (filo dough stuffed with spiced ground beef). Maybe meat isn&#39;t your thing, but have no fear! The Cheese Burek will do the trick. You also have Pasulj (Bean Soup) or Sopska Salata (onion, tomato, cucumber salad) topped with Feta cheese. Another option is the Cabbage Salad or fresh French Fries (ask them to top the fries with Feta!).

As you can see, it&#39;s not an extensive menu, but it&#39;s really all you need to know when it comes to basic Balkan dishes. If you can believe it, the old menu was much smaller. The prices are decent and you can lose a few hours there sipping Turkish coffee, beer or Fructal fruit juices. I highly recommend finishing the meal off with a Baklava or Tulumba (honey-soaked baked treat)."

This place can easily be missed amidst the little shops along Elmhurst Road. It is actually bigger inside than it appears from the outside. It&#39;s almost like an Eastern European men&#39;s club, with a few sitting at the bar or at side tables nearby talking sports or politics in another language. Still, we came with the intention of getting a good meal and we were certainly treated well.

The menu at Euro Grill is so small, it fits on two sides of a laminated card on the table. However, for the limited offerings, this menu is all you need. I got to try burek - a cheese filled pie that Ericka split with a few of us. As my main course, I ordered Mesane Meso (mixed meat plate). Now this platter was a huge assortment of beef, chicken and sausage. There was no way I&#39;d finish it in one sitting. I had some to take home... and still had 2 servings left of the meat! For the price, it&#39;s a great value. Our service was attentive. I also got the fruit juice, which was excellent with the carnivorous choice.

Only thing keeping this place from a 5th star was the lack of a dessert on the particular night of my visit. I was eager to try a dessert like baklava and unfortunately they had none.

I&#39;d be willing to come back here and try something else. Seems every menu item was a can&#39;t miss success. Definitely a great place for a filling meal. Highly recommended."

The service is still great, a welcoming environment, and polite and helpful staff.

The new location is great! It has a section of booths, several tables, and just in general a lot more space. A well-kept bar houses a selection of alcoholic en non-alcoholic beverages to accompany the great food.

That&#39;s the same everywhere.  What puts this store at the bottom is their incredibly rude and incompetent staff.  My wife went in there with our daughter who wanted to get a cup of coffee and the manager told her to leave because my wife has a service dog.  She showed him the dog&#39;s vest and tags but instead he started yelling at her from across the room embarrassing her in front of the other customers.  I called the manager and he was rude and wouldn&#39;t believe me when I told him he violated the law.  Later in the day I drove there with the law, chewed him out in front of his staff, but never got an apology from him.

I also filed a complaint with McDonalds&#39; corporate and they had the regional manager for the franchise stores call me, but he started to defend the store manager since he didn&#39;t understand the law either.  Finally I complained the village&#39;s health department and their manager was furious about their treatment of my wife, but said it didn&#39;t surprise him as he knows that store manager.  He said he was going to go there and personally set them straight.

If this is the way McDonalds (doesn&#39;t) train their staff and tolerates rude treatment of guests you can bet we&#39;ll never set foot in that store again, or most other McDonalds for that matter.

My +1 lived in Texas for a while and had been itching to (re)visit Lucky Star next door, so we came here for dinner first due to convenience.

We ordered the Grilled Calimari appetizer and the Coconut Battered Onion Rings.

I ordered a Cheeseburger (him: Eggplant Parm Sammy). During the ordering, the waitress never asked what kind of cheese I wanted (the menu says &#34;your choice of cheese&#34;), so I had to stop her and ask. Luckily I did, because there were 4 or so choices. Not sure what she was going to stick me with!

It was nearly impossible to flag her down, though she walked right by us multiple times. Towards the end of our meal she was nooooowhere to be found. She asked if I wanted a box, and I had to point out that we also needed the check.

The calamari and burger were both good! The latter was cooked perfectly medium, with the Provolone I asked for and fresh mushrooms (.75 upcharge). The fries were plentiful and hot.

We never got our onion rings, but we also weren&#39;t charged for them.

I&#39;d go back if my +1 has another Lone Star Country Night itch, and I&#39;d hope a different waitress would lead to an improved experience."

But, given that, I have no choice but to rate a single star. Here&#39;s why:
We stopped in for dinner on a random night b/c we had a taste for their pizza. So that&#39;s all we had, a large sausage pizza. Nothing fancy, no frills. Upon eating it we noticed that something was off... it was not their normal (delicious) pie. But, we thought nothing of it and finished the meal before heading home. Low and behold, around midnight, our intuition was confirmed... we both were hit with non-stop diarrhea and vomiting. And I&#39;m not talking about your usual several-hour bout... we ended up having to go to the emergency room b/c we absolutely could NOT stop either. Classic food poisoning. 

Now, this can happen to anyone at any restaurant. IT SHOULDN&#39;T, but it happens. We are not upset at this fact. What we are upset at is how Moretti&#39;s management has handled the whole situation:
Upon semi-recovering we contacted Moretti&#39;s to inform them of our situation. The manager on duty, Blake, responded in a manner that leaves one dumbfounded... he immediately, without hearing the entire story, interjected that &#34;it could&#39;ve been anything you ate that day...&#34; (possible, sure, but the only meal we both had was the pizza - in fact, we were in SEPARATE CITIES for the previous day and the morning/afternoon of) and then insisted that it could NOT have been the food because he &#34;had the entire staff eat the sausage pizza last night and no one got sick.&#34; This last statement is pure lunacy as we were just THEN (a day later) informing him of the experience and we were the &#34;only ones&#34; (so he claimed) to report anything. Any half-intelligent person understands that it is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE that he had the &#34;entire staff&#34; eat the sausage pizza (in particular off their vast menu) as a litmus test the night before. Confounding this terrible customer service, we contacted the corporate office and have thus far been given the run around.

As I said, this can happen to anyone but the fact that there is wanton disregard for looking into what occurred so that others might possibly be spared the circumstances we had to endure is beyond mind boggling. It has become painfully clear that Moretti&#39;s lacks concern for their customers... customers who, until now, have sang their praises.

Well, I can assure you that we will NOT be returning to Moretti&#39;s indefinitely. Additionally, I have zero hesitation in sharing this cautionary tale with any/all who will listen, just as I used to share my praises with zero hesitation to anyone who would listen...

They have a ton of banquet/meeting space. Super convenient for big groups. 
The French bread on the side is delish.  
They have good specials. 
It&#39;s a great place for a game. 

I can get better pizza other places, but let&#39;s face it, pizza is about comradery and fun and Moretti&#39;s provides both."

A few months ago I had the big lunch salad that came with a large hard chunk of something that i couldnt chew. They took it back to the kitchen and said it was a &#39;piece of bark&#39; and gave me another salad. I didn&#39;t think much of it until recently our son and his wife got food poisoning from a sausage pizza there. The while incident was handled very unprofessionally by the staff and Moretti&#39;s corporate office. Moretti&#39;s used to be a &#34;go to&#34; place for us. Unfortunately from now in we&#39;ll be eating elsewhere.

The food was great - loved the appetizer platter sampler, and the Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy special drink was tasty. Our server was attentive and fun - easy to talk to.
Equally good was the customer service. Our server mis-heard our order due to the loudness in the bar and we received a different pizza than what we ordered. The manager came by and offered to re-make the pizza correctly while we ate the one on the table - we said &#39;no, that&#39;s okay, this will be fine&#39; The manager said &#39;no, please tell me what you originally ordered and I&#39;ll have it made for you, you can take it home, we want this to be right.&#39; THAT is what quality is about!

Their pricing is fair, they are always super nice on the phone, the delivery drivers are also always friendly. We have never experienced an issue with our food being late or cold - it&#39;s always a hot and super delicious. 

The only thing I would ask for them to change is their jalapeno&#39;s - we ordered a pepperoni &amp; jalapeno pizza once and they put raw jalapeno&#39;s all over it instead of cooked or pickled jalapeno&#39;s and while it was good, it just didn&#39;t go well."

I sure didn&#39;t! But I now know that not only is it possible, but their healthy options taste delicious!

My company orders from Moretti&#39;s all the time for Beer O Clock, have had a holiday lunch catered in and have had a happy hour there so I&#39;m quite familiar with their food. I&#39;ve loved everything I&#39;ve tried from them but a standout for me in their catering menu is the Chicken Parmesan. Gooey goodness with some protein makes my belly smile. 

I hadn&#39;t ever been to the Bartlett location before and didn&#39;t even realize how many restaurants they have in Chicagoland. Answer is 7 by the way. Moretti&#39;s in Bartlett is adjacent to Cadillac Ranch - a line dancing club. If you eat at Moretti&#39;s, they give you a pass for Cadillac Ranch which will save you the $5 cover.

We had a big party of 16 people and when I walked in the hostess directed me to exactly where our table was. Our server for the night was attentive and on top of everything for the table, she was great! 

I&#39;m on a bit of a health kick right now and will make exceptions, for sure, but for the most part am trying to be good about what I eat. I ordered the Grilled Chicken &amp; Avocado Club Wrap and Chips and our server had no issue with me ordering it without tomatoes. The wrap comes with grilled chicken &amp; avocado (of course), bacon, lettuce, herb mayo and provolone cheese. It&#39;s a nice combination that tricks my mind into thinking I&#39;m eating healthy but still keeps it real with the bacon &amp; mayo. I enjoyed the wrap and everything in it went together well for a party in my mouth! I got two meals out of the dinner and it was just $8.99. Not too shabby at all!

More importantly now, the beer! They don&#39;t have a wide variety of beer options and their craft options are pretty much non existent. I was able to score a pint of Goose Island Green Line for $5 but that&#39;s pretty much the full extent of craftiness they offer. On swill beer, not only can you get a pitcher but even better - a table tapper! It was just $18 for a Miller Lite table tapper and by our calculations we got about 10 pints out of it. Now that&#39;s a good deal. Plus of course we got to look really cool with that thing on our table."

I&#39;ve also realized how spoiled I was for the first 35 years of my life living in the Chicago area!

Over the past 4 years or so, every time I come back to visit friends &amp; family in Streamwood, I always arrange a get-together for pizza &amp; drinks at Moretti&#39;s. The food has always been consistently good and the service has been good to very good. That is, up until tonight...

I called today to get a reservation for 5 people for 5 PM. Being in need of a hip replacement, I all but need to sit at a high top table. I was told the only one available was only big enough for 4 people. Knowing 1 or 2 of the people wouldn&#39;t be showing up until after 6, I went ahead and took it.  Moretti&#39;s hostess staff has always been understanding and do whatever they can to try to accommodate my needs.

I arrived slightly before 5 and 2 others came between 5 and 5:15.  MALLORY was our server. We ordered our drinks (lemonades and iced teas) and a couple of appetizers so we could wait a bit before ordering pizza.  As Mallory cleared our plates when we were finished, a marinara cup slid off of the plate, covering her pant leg with it. When the cup struck the floor, it obviously spun and flung a chunk of tomato which struck my sister in the shoulder. I told her she should go to the bar so she could get a cloth bar towel with soda water so it wouldn&#39;t stain.

Several minutes later, the manager (BLAKE) came over to check with us since he had heard that there was a problem. He was VERY apologetic and offered to pay for dry cleaning the shirt or if there was anything else he could do for us. When we told him it wasn&#39;t a problem at all, just a matter of physics and these things happen, he thanked us for being so understanding.

FINALLY after being there for about an hour we decide to order a couple of pizzas. Tuesday is HALF PRICE PIZZA NIGHT (dine in only!) so the place is pretty busy from 5 PM on. We settled on what we wanted and ordered a couple. Just after the pizzas came to the table, our 4th finally arrived. Now mind you, by now we&#39;ve probably been there an hour and a half and are just getting our pizzas. Meanwhile, Mallory has been refilling our lemonades and iced teas without a moment&#39;s hesitation or one of us having to ask.

Now, I&#39;ve gone to restaurants where the server thinks, &#34;Great, free refills and discounted food... so much for a decent tip!&#34; and the service they have provided has shown it. That was NOT the case tonight. All in all, we occupied a table for an extended period and only wound up with a $50 tab. And nearly a third of that was 3 beers that our 4th person ordered! And yet, during the entire time we were occupying one of her tables, Mallory&#39;s service and personality never wavered, not once. Because of her awesome service and the fact that she could have turned the table at least once if not twice during our stay, we made sure to take that into account when we left her tip.

Thanks again to Mallory for the awesome service and to Blake for coming over to offer to cover any costs incurred by the minor mishap. It&#39;s things like this that keep me coming back to the Bartlett Moretti&#39;s whenever I&#39;m in town!!"

Food- Started off with some appies- mozzarella sticks and spinach and artichoke chips.  The mozzarella sticks were decent enough but the marina sauce was very chunky and didn&#39;t coat the stick like it&#39;s supposed to.  The spinach and artichoke chip was pretty good, I&#39;m pretty sure it was fresh, if not they spruced it up enough to where it makes a good appetizer.  The chips were not homemade but they added some seasoning to them that made them taste a little bit more restaurant quality.  For dinner I had the tour of Tuscany, which came with three different entree samples.  First thing on there was the ziti pasta.  This was a highlight of the plate, a highlight of the table really.  Noodles were cooked well, and it came with fresh spinach, tomatoes and Italian sausage inside.  The sauce it came in was a little soupy, but was good because you could soak it up with the garlic bread.  Only complaint was there weren&#39;t a lot of noodles.  Next sample was the eggplant Parmesan.  The eggplant had decent flavor, but I think they cooked it with the sauce on because the inner eggplant was extremely mushy.  The final sample was a chicken in garlic butter sauce.  The chicken has nice flavor, but wasn&#39;t anything outstanding, a bit tough.  Overall the food was average, two stars for the large venue.  

Service- service was standard, nothing special.  

Like I said I&#39;d recommend to parties over 10 but otherwise I think there&#39;s better options."

It&#39;s amazing, thin crust, the right amount of cheese, the sauce was on point not too sweet, and they put just the right amount on.

From the outside, it looks like a fun place! And when you walk in, the atmosphere was very inviting and open. We got seated right away and our waitress stopped by pretty quick. 

The menu is very extensive and has a wide range of options. We got a pepperoni thin crust pizza and an order of bruschetta. The pizza was pretty good, and the bruschetta was also quite nice. I&#39;d say that neither was very unique or exceptional, but both were quite tasty. I think that we would definitely come back to try out the restaurant again."

I feel like based on the ingredients tasting fresh (except the mac and cheese) we had a &#34;MISS&#34; when it came to the preparation. Wrote Bartlett restaurant and we&#39;ll see what happens. We would like to try it again because the photos on here look good but the bill was already $34 last night for those two small pizzas and nobody wants to eat the left-overs because it was just so so. (I actually picked up my cheese on the pizza and wiped half the BBQ sauce away there was so much. The sauce tasted good but wouldn&#39;t order that specific one again at least in PAN style.) And I disliked the burnt crust and overcooked cheese.

Most recently, we sat at the side bar. Did you know that they had a second bar off to the side?  I didn&#39;t. Three TVs are setup above the bar and we were able to watch the Chicago Blackhawks, the World Series and College Football all at once. I was extremely pleased.

Our server/bartender, Cory, took great care of us and even had a manager change the channel when one college game was over to switch to another. She was attentive and offered some good suggestions. 

The bar was clean. I didn&#39;t feel grossed out sitting there as I often do at other bars. And Cory was on top of checking the glasses. She would pick up a glass, inspect it in the light and wipes spots off or even discard as needed. I appreciate that sort of attention to detail. 

The food was served up hot and quickly. Again, no room for any complaints.

I may just have to add Moretti&#39;s back to the list of acceptable places for dinner that&#39;s close to home."

The restaurant was 3/4 empty, but we were told that there were no hi-top tables because they were all reserved.  We could have had one, but only until 7 o&#39;clock when the people who reserved it decided to show up.  WTF is up with that Morretti&#39;s?  I&#39;ve been going to this location since it opened and the one in Edison Park for years before that.  Let me get this right, you&#39;re willing to turn away customers who are willing to sit there several hours eating and drinking before a game, who will continue eating and drinking during the game, so that someone can stroll in at game time and get a seat.  Not to mention that there were spaces at the bar listed as reserved.  How do you reserve a bar spot?  Does it come with a stool or is it just the space at the bar.  That was the most ridiculous and unprofessional thing that I have ever seen at a restaurant, especially one that my wife and I frequent quite often.  But don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t be coming back again or maybe I should make a reservation for an event 10 weeks out, complete with bar reservations.   Maybe you should educate the public a little about this, and not have the people who do the seating be totally clueless to your questions, as well as the a$$hat manager who could have cared less.

We went to Bannerman&#39;s instead and had a great time sitting at a hi top that we didn&#39;t need reservations for and watched both games.  Your loss Morretti&#39;s .  Maybe you&#39;ve gotten too big to care about the customers who come into your places.

The girlfriend wanted to try some new restaurants so after some research she found this place, and yesterday we decided to give it a try. First our server was good (josh), he was attentive and friendly. The food was really good from the French fries down to each of our meals. I recently went gluten free so finding a good tasting gluten free pizza is very hard, if not impossible. Well this place has not only an edible gluten free pizza but delicious. I will come here again for sure."

I came at an off time (around 3pm) to meet up with a friend for a bite to eat so it wasn&#39;t busy. I&#39;ve been curious about it for some 8-9 months now because no matter what hour I seem to drive past it at, there are always cars there!
    The interior was fine, spacious, didn&#39;t pay too much attention to décor or anything but it seemed clean (bathroom included), could probably use a few new tiles in the floor and a couple new seat benches to replace the tearing ones, but that&#39;s all that caught my eye.
    Our server was very nice and attentive (Ryan, I think his name was), brought us a basket of bread and our drinks and made sure to keep our drinks filled even after we paid (always a plus in my book). 
    I ordered the Chicken and Strawberry salad ($10.99) which was very good and large! Besides mixed greens, chicken, and strawberries, it also had mandarin oranges, candied pecans, feta cheese, grapes, red onions, and was tossed in a raspberry vinaigrette. Worth it.
    Though I didn&#39;t order anything else, I did see that they have a rewards card if you are a frequent flyer, and they also have various drink and meal specials (including lunch specials during the week) which seemed appealing. 
    By the time we left, people were starting to come for dinner. Moretti&#39;s does take reservations so if you&#39;re planning on coming at a mealtime hour I&#39;d say you probably should make reservations; like I said, I&#39;ve gone pass this place as late as 3am+ and still seen cars there, during peak hours it&#39;s busy (no, 3am is not a peak hour). I think the late business is in part due to some sort of club thing there. I don&#39;t know details, but the person I went with mentioned that they had some sort of dance portion or something, I don&#39;t know.
    Well, I know they&#39;re known for the pizza and such, but as of right now all I can recommend is that salad, I&#39;d be willing to go back and I&#39;m sure I will!"

Beer selection is fairly meh, can we get a nice craft brew as one of the choices?  And no, dont&#39;t even try to tell me Fat Tire is craft brew.

The server we had was new and seemed a bit sleepy or something, had a hard time getting an order done for 14 people -- management said it was because he was new (maybe you should have had a more experienced person working a large crowd?)  So our meal, not surprisingly, took forever.  He also mischarged us on a separate check and they already ran the credit card and refused to refund the error?  Weird right?  Offered a store credit instead; what is that about?  Anyway, they finally just offered straight cash back after much complaining; they claim they can not offer refunds when they screw up, they have to go through their corporate office -- i don&#39;t get it.  I think you can find a better brewpub.   Unless you love cheese"

I ordered the gnocchi with vodka sauce which had a bold flavor and my boyfriend got a gluten free pizza and it was the best gluten free crust he has had since going on a gluten free diet recently.

I had the grilled calamari app and it was DISGUSTING! It was rubbery and had no flavor. It took me close to 5 minutes to chew a piece down the size of my pinky. 

The other time I went I had mozzarella sticks and the vodka gnocchi which were both very good! The bartenders could use a little work, the only good one I saw was a guy who was on top of it. The one chick poured me a 312 and a greenline draft and got them confused and had to actually turn around towards the tap system to figure it out. They don&#39;t have more than 6 beers on tap- you should know your product enough to know the 312 is a wheat beer and will be the cloudy one but I guess common sense just doesn&#39;t bless us all.

When will establishments realize that&#39;s what brings customers back?! Food can be just fine, but when you don&#39;t pair it with great service.. Bye bye. 
My 90 year old grandpa likes coming here and apparently it&#39;s one of the only places he doesn&#39;t complain about.. so I was more than willing to take him.  
We arrived, a party of 6, on a Saturday night to a pretty busy place (charity event going on next door, Bulls game on) so we expected to wait a little bit. 
The hostess originally told us 45 minutes to an hour. After about 40 minutes, they buzzed us that are table was ready. Knowing that we had a barely mobile senior citizen with us, they told us after we made our way up to the reception desk, that it was a mistake and that our table is not ready, but that it shouldn&#39;t be more than a few minutes. Okay, fine. 10 minutes go by.. We&#39;re still not seated.
My poor grandpa was standing for all this time, anticipating that we&#39;d be seated shortly. He was frustrated, tired and feeble from standing. There were no places for him to even sit down, nor was he offered a seat by any of the staff.  My mom went up the reception desk to see if we can start our order, where she was rudely interrupted by the &#34;star&#34; of our evening, the little blonde hostess, who had the audacity to say to my mom, with a gleaming attitude, &#34;no, but the table is all boxed up so as soon as they get up we&#39;ll clean it up for you.. At least you&#39;re NOT waiting an hour!&#34; And walked away. Seriously? Who says that. This was after she and the other hostess were preoccupied with discussing their plans for later that evening, instead of doing her job. I said out loud, &#34;wow, what great customer service skills this hostess has!&#34;, which caught the other hostess&#39; attention, but she didn&#39;t even care.  When we were finally seated, Josh took care of us very well and did so much for us.  We ordered a pizza, grandpa got spaghetti, my mom got a burger that she really didn&#39;t care for as did my sister and my dad and I got the rib special. The ribs were okay. Overall, the waiter service was great, the food was average, but the hostess service killed our experience and we will not be back unless grandpa wants to go."

Nothing special, just a piece of French bread. We ordered a medium deep dish roast beef pizza, the tour of Tuscany, and a pasta with shrimp, sausage, and chicken.
The pizza was nothing special had to much sauce for my liking, the roast beef on top tasted like it had freezer burn and the crust was tastless.. The tour of Tuscany includes baked ziti, very plain, the eggplant parmesan was very dry. It had hardly any sauce and the eggplant not much flavor. The chicken was Fabulous. This was the best part of the meal. The only problem is there was 3 of us splitting and the piece was small. 
The pasta dish was spicy. My husband likes spicy, so he ate it. I think the menu should indicate that this dish is spicy.
We didn&#39;t have dessert. I kind of felt like I had paid to much for very bland food. There are way better places for pizza and pasta. Don&#34;t let the amount of cars in the lot fool you. The place is very bland."

Our server was great, she was on point with the drinks, checking in, giving us decent suggestions.

Food - for apps we got the coconut onion rings - server suggested it, I figured she looks like knows food so lets give it a shot.  She was right, it was pretty good, tasted like an onion ring but the sweet n sour sauce give it a little extra something.

We ended up getting pizza - well done.  I&#39;ve had there&#39;s before at a different location, wasn&#39;t really impressed but didn&#39;t feel it was bad either.  It was definitely decent, nice thin crust.  

Warning... Pizza is good when it&#39;s hot.... eating left overs after heating it up, doesn&#39;t taste the same.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be asked to watch at a game at one of the many Moretti&#39;s locations.  I heard the other food&#39;s pretty good as well, but I have my favorites when it comes to Pizza."

Great family atmosphere, pretty knowledgeable servers (like JOHN), good food, reasonable prices. Can&#39;t get enough. I know there is another one closer to home in Schaumburg, but I first went to this one in Bartlett and now it&#39;s our Moretti&#39;s. They have specials on Wednesdays that come via email and/or text and they really make you want to come back for more. We have had their sandwiches, pizza and burgers, but I recommend their Rosemary Lemon Chicken and Coconut Onion Rings if you are looking for a killer meal!! 

I have run into the slower server here and there, but where can you go nowadays that doesn&#39;t have one or two of those people? If you want a glass of ice water, I believe it&#39;s well water, so be prepared to have soda, tea or drinks. Soda tastes a little off, but the food makes up for it to me.

Okay, they have poor tap water, this translates to anything with water in it (beverages like fountain drinks and duh water to taste bad, the staff is knowledgeable about this and when I mentioned it they offered to get me something else - i opted for a Beer so problem solved!).  

The pizza is what I usually come here for.  Thin crust is amazing!  A good appetizer to try is the coconut onion rings.  They&#39;re not the onion rings that leave you thinking where&#39;s the onion.  You get 7 and these suckers are HUGE, 1 appetizer is good for 3-4 people!

1. Started off well. Hostess was friendly and welcoming (as usual).

2.  Waitress (Angelica) came over after we were seated for more than 5min.  She decided to take a seat next to me in a booth. Clearly, any established restaurant knows that this is a no-no. Get out of my personal space.  You are not my friend and there is no reason why ANYONE should ever be that close to me. 

3.  Waitress had ZERO knowledge of the beers offered on tap or bottled.  I&#39;ll just take a water then, thank you. She was obnoxiously loud and pushy. -I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;re waiting to go eat your pizza?  Well I guess I&#39;ll hurry up and order. 

4.  Food came- great as always. Waitress on the other hand... Downward spiral.  Checked up once. Left in a hurry. Unable to get another water.  

5.  Ate. Leftover pizza sitting. Normally, the table would be cleared and dessert offered.  Hey, that&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll wait 20min to order my cannoli. still no water by the way.  

6.  Rude and loud employees.  Dearest Angelica, I do not believe that shouting, &#34;what up big money!&#34;to another employee Is appropriate. What do I know though?  I&#39;m there for great food and service. I&#39;m just the customer. 

7.  Another 20min wait for a check.  Beer glasses empty and wait for it... Water still empty. 

8.  We paid our bill and left. We were beyond disappointed in the experience. Employees should not have personal, loud and leud conversations in front of customers.  They should not rush customers because their own dinner is waiting. A customer should never have to wait as long as we did for any kind of service.  

I truly hope management is not aware of their behavior.  If so, I hope the owners know that their managers and employees are going to be the reason why they lose customers."

They have a huge menu selection of all different types of food. There is NO WAY you wouldn&#39;t be able to find something that sounds good. The portions are big, you will have plenty of leftovers to bring home. The one thing I will complain about it the beer menu, it is very limited(Miller,Coors, Blue Moon). They do have specials on Sunday for draft beer so that kind of made up for their limited selection.

I ordered the speghetti with italian sausage and it came with garlic bread. I guess my meal looked pretty good because my nephew who ordered pizza decided he wanted to share my speghetti with me, I know how nice right! : ) The italian sausage had a spice to it, I LOVED it!!

I&#39;ve always had sausage or cheese and have enjoyed it. However,  we recently ordered the Mac n&#39; cheese pizza and were less than impressed...

Lots of comfort food and huge portions. We come here with my parents once in a while and we always leave super full and satisfied. 

The last time I was here, I was hungover and my sister-in-law talks me into the mac n cheese pizza. Just fuck the bullshit, right? So i do. Mac n cheese on garlicky pizzas crust. Pretty gosh darn tasty. the end pieces were a little hard. The middle sections were excellent, and cheesy and starchy as all fucking hell. Delicious. I dipped my slices in some marinara sauce, which kinda sounds weird, but it was fine. Maybe some Alfredo dipping sauce would rip tho. Next time I&#39;m feeling like gaining 4 lbs at dinner, I&#39;ll get the Alfredo sauce dip too. 

Anyway.. the beer list is a little limiting (MGD, Sam Adams), but the food is good and plentiful. Lots of great apps to try as well.

Get some."

It bears repeating - every time. Drinks, food, service - great every time. Only one thing I wish was different - they have lots of TV&#39;s and are always playing blooper videos, but some of the videos can be more violent or graphic than I&#39;d like my kids to see. I know they can&#39;t control the content within the shows they&#39;re playing but I wish they were showing more AFV type bloopers instead of some of the harder blooper stuff you might see on MTV."

I&#39;m glad that such a place exists so close by.

For my family - it is our &#34;we are hungry and in the mood for good pizza but don&#39;t want to go far and spend a lot of money&#34; place. When meeting friends - it is our &#34;we can grab some appetizers and drinks and catch up on life events and be as loud as we want and still won&#39;t be able to be heard&#34; place. When getting take out, it is our &#34;curbside pickup&#34; place. When attending their kiddie New Year&#39;s event, it is our &#34;wonderful place for the kids to enjoy their new year and be loud and dance and they won&#39;t mess up my house&#34; place. And, of course, the catering...that is my personal favorite &#34;don&#39;t want to cook and having people over and it satisfies everyone&#39;s palette&#34; place.

As a previous reviewer said - it is NOISY. A great place for my kids because they get loud sometimes. :)

The tables are jammed together, too - kind of felt like we were creeping into other people&#39;s dining space. Not a big fan of that.

Gets crowded on the weekends and when there are sporting events so take that into consideration!

We will continue to go there as long as they are around. It is truly one of our faves."

-Family friendly- There were nothing, but families in the restaurant.
-TVs- not only did they have ESPN on, but America&#39;s Funniest Home videos. Again, making it family friendly. Also, they have the bar playing game on TV where you compete against other people answering questions.
-Food- The food was o.k., but it seem like typical bar food. My son and wife loved it. I do have to say the pizza had a ton of cheese. 
-Decor- Nice place and the beer garden/ patio looks very nice.

Tips:
-By 5 pm it will be crowded, arrive early.
-Expect it to be noisy, it is a bar and the dining area has a ton of families."

I&#39;m writing this review a long time after having been there, but the first thing that popped into my head was that my water tasted so shitty, I ended up drinking beer that night. 

Otherwise, the pizza was excellent, bruschetta was great, and the table tapper was a good idea (just make sure there&#39;s enough beer drinkers at your table, because warm beer is no good!). We waited a while for our table for four plus a high chair, but there was a game on that night so I understand. Service was just okay, but I&#39;m definitely gonna try their pizza to go/delivery."

I can&#39;t recall when the last time I ate in Bartlett if ever but because it was a 30 B-day celebration for my illegally adopted daughter as in she a friend&#39;s offspring but I love her as if she were my own we drove the hour plus to Moretti&#39;s and even if the b-day celebration wasn&#39;t for her but her really old dad the drive would have been worth it for the pizza. 

Crisp, saucy and yum yum for the tum tum it was. It appears Moretti&#39;s has multiple locations so I&#39;m going to have to do some campaigning for them to come out to the corn fields of DeKalb or Sycamore because if they were to it easily become my number one pizza place"

I think it would behoove them to put a wall up between the bar and the restaurant to make it more cozy. I can&#39;t remember what the other restaurants had in there, but I believe it was open, too. The 2nd bar was closed, else I would have rather eaten there. Anyway, about the food... We had the stuffed mushrooms (which I made at home myself a few nights later) and each had a salad. Friend had the herbed chicken salad and declared it was the best salad she&#39;d had in a long time and I had their chopped salad with chicken. I loved the grilled chicken and crispy bits of prosciutto as well as the roasted red peppers. I think I&#39;ll try the house dressing on it next time. 

Prior to my friend arriving I had an Irish coffee which was not traditional -- it was nutty; frangelico? It was ok, and served in a beer tumbler. No footed glass to which the server apologized. (I really don&#39;t care) It hit the spot and the price was right. 

Definitely a place for both sporties and families. Each tele has something different. America&#39;s funniest videos on two different screens (two different episodes) and different sports channels.  

For those raving about the pizza, &#34;let me be the judge of that&#34;. I am a fan of cracker thin crust and quite picky about the italian sausage that is put on my &#39;za. Sausage can be too farmy (there are places that are like this - it&#39;s called the sausage is OLD) or too sweet. Will have to try next time we go there. Oh, maybe they can get a GLUTEN FREE crust!!  :) 

Oh, and if you&#39;re trying to turn left (west) out of their parking lot, be patient but be very careful. Trucks are a mainstay on Rte 20 and you can pull into the center lane and just wait til you can merge. Or turn right and try to figure getting back on 20... Just be careful!!"

Maybe on half-price pizza night it would taste better knowing it&#39;s a great deal.  Place is loud.  The tables and booths don&#39;t feel clean.  Service is average.

We went about a month ago in a group of 7.  Service was VERY good - food okay, bar drinks took a long time.  However, I&#39;m now in love with their apple martinis :)

Last week my husband and I went alone and sat outside.  Seemed to be a lot of confusion as to who our server was, but once that got straightened out everything was good.  Our server brought my husband a birthday sundae, which was very sweet and unnecessary - she oveheard us talking and did it on her own.  My husband was a little mortified that he was sung to but 8 people, but it was cute and a nice gesture.

Where have all the cowboys come from? I had no idea we had so many in Illinois. I mean, they look authentic, from a Yankee point of view anyway. And their womenfolk in their high waisted, no pocket jeans seemed to be the real thing too! 

Country - Western Music until 2 AM. 

We arrived around midnight found a nice booth right next to the roller ink sized dance floor where the line dancers were doing their thing. Some of us in the group really like Country Music, me not so much. But the energy of the regular dancers there made me a fan. From another in the group I learned they were playing more modern Country. The dancers were a hell of a lot of fun to watch. There was one really enthusiastic little cowboy that did four turns for every other man&#39;s two and slid way further, stomped way harder, and kicked way higher. We whistled him a shout and wished for some rope to lasso him a bit closer. 

The cocktail servers were a lot of fun. They offered to bring us a cowboy over to dance with but we declined gracefully. They were really on the ball and seriously patient with our drunk fumbling cash handling fingers. The female bartender I found was excellent as well. I am not at all fond of the tall white bartender who told me a racist joke while I waited for her to pour my drinks. Seriously? WTF?? 

The clientele are really nice. 
Someone bought us drinks but the server couldn&#39;t find him for us to thank. He showed up a bit later just to say hello. How sweet. Another cowboy hopped in our booth to say howdy and welcome us. If anyone in our group attempted a line dance the folks on the floor did their best to help them learn with subtle gestures. When they didn&#39;t catch on too quickly the gestures got bigger. 

By 1:30 a crowd of not so Western looking people gathered around the dance floor waiting their turn. By 1:45 we were pretty anxious for a change in tunes as well. I think the DJ was five minutes late in making the switch. It felt like an hour. We saw our booth cowboy juking with two girls, who knew cowboys juked? 
Young looking girls were carded on the floor. Glad to see they&#39;re on top of their game here, those girls looked pre-pubescent. 
Especially in the bathroom where later I found them nursing one of the three back from puking in a stall. 

The bathrooms are big, lots of stalls to accommodate lots of people. BUT...by 12:30 half of them were out of toilet paper and when I left at 4 AM. they&#39;d still not been refilled. The paper towels were gone as well. :("

The owner said he told me only if the order was $500. 00. I told them had I known, my son pick up a cake in their area at 10:30 am. Had I know I would have ask my son to go straight to pick the food up. So my son had to go out and pick up the said order. When my son came home, we already had guests. As I started getting the food ready, I notice there was something missing. And I was right. They did not give me 3 trays of egg roll. I called the owner and ask that this time since he&#39;s neglectful of his orders to deliver it to us. His answer was, he couldn&#39;t. That If I want I&#39;ll just cancel the order. My point is I ordered that, I need that. Not a single word of apology from him. He was actually blaming my son for the missing order.

I will stalk your Lola&#39;s house if she makes it from scratch. That&#39;s how much I love fresh Pandesal (the fresh, slightly sweet bread that I grew up having many Sunday mornings when I was a wee one in Chicago). 

I remember getting fresh pandesal from here years ago but then the bakery just went away.  I heard rumors, I saw an empty storefront.  But now, I guess someone is back making not only pandesal, but also lots of other fresh baked goods AND some take out foods like dinuguan, pancit and adobo.  I also saw Brazo&#39;s de Mercedes in the cooler, some pork and chicken siopao, cucinta, sapin sapin and casava cake. Great stuff to get in a pinch if you don&#39;t feel like making it yourself. 

The mom and I got some lechon kawali--good pork, but the skin was too chewy. I also tried the corned beef hash pandesal--genius idea, but I prefer my corned beef hash overdone. The regular pedesal was good--soft, puffy, but I&#39;d love to get the fresh out of the oven pandesal.  We also tried the sesame balls--not the same as my favorite from Chinatown, but made with sweet white bean filling and still ok.

I ordered a 1/4 sheet ube cake for my family to eat on Christmas eve. I called on a Thursday afternoon. The man who answered the phone was a bit rude. In the midst of my order, he just started speaking to someone else and laughing without any &#34;excuse me&#34; and then carried on as if I was taking too long to order. Mind you, I&#39;m not much of a talker... 

On Monday, I drove 35 min and picked up my cake in the afternoon. I paid $32, which I thought was a decent price. I refrigerated it overnight and cut it after Christmas eve dinner. Well, the cake was much too &#39;heavy&#39;. It almost seemed like the baker had used batter from a box. The macapuno was very tough in the middle. The frosting was overdone. I had eaten much better homemade ube cake in the past that was light, &#39;fluffy&#39;, and just overall delicious. I definitely will not be returning to this shop for baked goods. I was really looking forward to eat but was terribly disappointed."

Anyway, the waitress had a bit of an attitude about it, and didn&#39;t apologize, even when my friend pointed out that it seemed like old wine, perhaps. She was like, &#34;Do you want a new one?&#34; No, she didn&#39;t. Why risk a crappy sangria again? She got a merlot instead. Anyway, her meal was not good.

When we arrived it was about half full, but was crowded by 8.  This was on a Tuesday evening, too... I guess Big Bowl is still a happenin&#39; place.


Drinks: Original Ginger Ale ($4)
Just what I needed: nice and ginger-y without being overly strong. 


Appetizer: Potsticker Combo ($9 for six)
The combo includes two pork, two chicken, and two veggie.  I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the veggie; the peanuts didn&#39;t do it for me - not only a texture thing, but while biting the potstickers, peanuts started tumbling out. Meh.  Maybe if they were crushed up a bit?  The sauces were good, but I&#39;d have been just as content with soy sauce.


Entree: Ginger Sea Scallops and Shrimp ($17), brown rice
The best parts were the scallops: they were cooked perfectly.  The flavor of the dish was really nice and the quantity was actually more ample than I had assumed. The shrimp were deshelled (yay!), but also in these little corkscrew shapes which kind of weirded me out because they looked like pasta. I mean.. what do they do, wrap them around sticks before cooking? They tasted fine and weren&#39;t rubbery or overcooked. 

My only complaints had to do with the brown rice and the sauce. The rice was reeeally fluffy (Uncle Ben&#39;s-like) so was kind of all over the place and impossible to eat with chopsticks.  I like my rice to be...I dunno, heartier?  And the sauce?  There was WAY TOO MUCH of it!  It absolutely drowned the rice.  It was a watery consistency, so really no way to contain it and save the rice! Oh well; I guess I&#39;ll just make fresh rice at home to go with my leftovers. 


Dessert: nil.  nada.  zilch.
Our server came by with a plate showcasing their four desserts.  We had seen the same display plate just chillin&#39; on a station area by the aisles when we were seated. The same plate was left between that aisle with lots of traffic and about 8&#34; from my (very clean) head. I know it&#39;s common for restaurants to have desserts presented in this manner because it&#39;s a convenient way to show customers their options, and I know these are thrown away.  I get it, but these plates had been sitting out uncovered on the top of the station area(s -- there were multiple) and out in the open, crusting over... just was visually unappealing to me, so no dessert for us.



$25 before tip - with delicious seafood leftovers - was A-OK."

We&#39;d had them in my previous home (Dallas) for a while but then they all closed. It was the first place I ever had lettuce wraps (cups of iceberg lettuce filled with spicy chicken and rice noodles), and they made their own ginger ale. 

However, I&#39;ve lived here a number of years now and somehow never made it to Big Bowl! So yesterday, in need of lunch and near the mall, a friend and I stopped in. 

There was a supposed wait of 15 minutes, but it ended up being much less. Good thing, because there weren&#39;t any benches etc. to wait on, just some tall two-top tables annexed from the bar...but how about if bar patrons are using them? The lobby isn&#39;t huge to accommodate, say, a waiting week-end crowd.

Anyway, we got a table quickly and our waitress swept in to inform us of how everything works. They serve Chinese and Thai fare, and also have a stir fry bar (think BD&#39;s, Flat Top Grill etc.) 

Their menu starts with a number of creative cocktails, as well as beer and wine (nice that they tell you the origin), and they still make the fresh ginger ale, but we both got the fresh lemonade: plain for her, hibiscus for me, both excellent. 

We started with the chicken and peanut egg rolls, probably the best egg rolls I&#39;d ever had: hot, crispy wontons stuffed with the creative filling. However, you don&#39;t get spoons with your utensils, only forks (no knife either...?) and since we didn&#39;t want to double-dip we had to drip or smear on sauce with our forks, which was awkward.

There are a lot of tempting entree choices, but finally my friend chose the sesame chicken and I got the Thai chicken panang curry. 

Here is where Big Bowl committed an infraction that I really despise. I look carefully at lists of ingredients on the menu to make sure I like everything; otherwise I will ask that the dish be made without it, or if it&#39;s too critical, just order something else. The panang curry is described on the menu as &#34;sliced chicken in peanut-coconut curry sauce, fresno peppers, snow peas.&#34; I like snow peas (the slim, crunchy pods), so I went ahead and ordered. 

When I got the dish, it came with a couple of snow peas but about two fistfuls of regular peas, which I just can&#39;t eat (it&#39;s a texture thing). So I spent five minutes painstakingly picking them all out of my dish. When the waitress came to check on us I asked why it wasn&#39;t specified on the menu (it&#39;s worth mentioning that other items on the menu do say &#34;peas&#34; specifically). She said they could make the dish again, but I wasn&#39;t going to make my friend wait and we didn&#39;t have time. 

She went away, and a few minutes later the chef came out, again saying they could remake the dish, but again, we didn&#39;t wish to wait (and I had already deconstructed my dish anyway). THEN the manager came over, offered again to remake it ( &#34; &#34; ), and said they were taking it off the bill for the trouble. (I realized later this is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, and this seems to be their M.O. when something is wrong, because I recall similar treatment when something was made incorrectly at Wildfire many years ago.) It was nice that they tried to make it right, but ultimately the menu needs to be correct. 

Anyway, the dish was very good, though for something specified as spicy it really wasn&#39;t: the coconut and peanut flavors smoothed over everything. The chicken was incredibly tender, and the veggies crisp. 

My friend said her sesame chicken might have been the best she&#39;d ever had, very flavorful (It looked lovely with colorful veggies and lacquered-brown meat). 

Overall, despite the bobble of inconvenience, Big Bowl&#39;s management knew how to rectify the problem, and the food really is excellent. Try it out (but inquire about the ingredients if you have any doubts)."

The family was craving some Chinese food but also wanted something that didn&#39;t cause us to make a date with our bathroom afterwards. My sister and her &#34;roommate&#34; live out in Schaumburg and recommended here. Okay, cool. 
We went on a Friday around 5:30pm so it wasn&#39;t too busy. We were sat right away. 

Our waitress was very nice and attentive, she took a minute to go through the menu for my wife and I, who had never been there before and explained how the menu was laid out. We got some overpriced beers and looked over the menu. As far as the menu goes, there isn&#39;t a big variety, they keep it simple. When I see that, I assume the offerings then are perfected. 

We got the variety potstickers appetizer as well as the chicken lettuce wraps. They were okay. I was a little disappointed in the potstickers, they were small and other than the veggie one, they lacked a burst of flavoring. As for the chicken lettuce wraps, I just wasn&#39;t a fan. It was dense and combining the rice noodles in the wet mixture made for an odd consistency. I&#39;ll pass next time on either. 

As for the main course, I got the sesame chicken with fried rice, the wife got shrimp pad thai, the other two got the same thing and our little one got chicken bites. It didn&#39;t take terribly long for our food to arrive, and these were the highlight of the evening. The sesame chicken was fantastic, nice chunks of delicious chicken breast, lightly coated and fried to perfection, with a spicy sesame sauce. Wow. The fried rice was good too, wasn&#39;t heavy, full of flavor, just pure deliciousness. I had a bite of my wife&#39;s shrimp pad thai, very good, huge flavor, and didn&#39;t feel heavy or greasy. I loved it. 

All and all we had a good time, the entree&#39;s were a knockout, but the appetizers, and the price will make me consider going somewhere else probably, not to say I would never go back here, but I&#39;ll have to really be in the mood."

It only took my friend about 20 minutes of perusing Yelp to finally decide on where to go to eat. Big Bowl won out because 1. It&#39;s close to Ikea where we just spent three hours of our lives looking some Swedish jam (yeah, Swedish jam, it&#39;s a thing). And 2. It&#39;s asian food! Can&#39;t go wrong with some curry or pad thai. Yummm.

When we went it was early evening on a Saturday and apparently it&#39;s the place to be cause it was packed. (Btw good luck finding a parking spot. Not an easy task.) Good news, the place is pretty big so we did get seated right away.

Now on to the hard part... what to order. The server was friendly and went through the menu for us. Now reading a menu is rocket science but she explained how the stir fry bar worked. Which was either letting the chef pick everything for you or you picking out your own proteins and whatnot. I wasn&#39;t truly listening because I knew I didn&#39;t want that. Instead I got the vegetable pad thai. I heard that&#39;s what they are known for and when eating at a place you have gotta try their calling card. Overall, I thought that the pad thai was alright. It was good in the moment but nothing memorable. And it could be just that I&#39;m someone who prefers a little more spices.

I also ordered two drinks: a Sapporo (just cause I wanted to try it) and their special of the day a glass of blood orange sangria. The Sapporo, which is a Japanese beer, did not taste like beer. It wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t worth it. It was like a flat hard cider. The sangria, on the other hand, was great! Perfect balance of fruit and wine. The blood orange added a nice tangy taste to it. I would have loved to drink more!

Cons of the place is that it&#39;s $$$$. For some of the dishes the portion are big, so it&#39;s not too overpriced, but for other things, like the cocktails, they are hella expensive. So make sure you check your bank balance beforehand. 

To sum it up, if you&#39;re in the area (and maybe hungry from looking for jam) I&#39;d check this place out."

They have a nice blend of Thai and Chinese food. They have their own Ginger Ale.  I ordered a Thai Chili shrimp that had a really nice combination of heat and flavor."

I rate it two stars because I have had better but it&#39;s a personal preference...

Service was good, Cooking was good, Ingredients were good.

Summer Rolls... I guess these are ok. We ordered the ones with shrimp and I couldn&#39;t find any shrimp in them...? Maybe they were diced up so small as they only charge like 75 cents more than the vegetarian roll...? Worth $7.50, no.

Chinese spare ribs were good. Fall off the bone which is not normal for how Chinese cook them but the flavor is good. This was the best item I had.

Pad Thai... Umm all I can say is sour?! Like either there was a vinegar soy in there or they squeezed a lot of lime juice into the sauce. I&#39;ve never tasted anything like it before in Thailand or any Thai restaurant here in the US... The chicken in it was very good as well as the rest of the ingredients, the sauce is not good, killed the dish.

Shrimp &amp; scallop dish. Cooked perfectly... salty as no other... there was so much of the soupy sauce it pooled and soaked into the rice... maybe this is normal presentation...?

I can&#39;t say I&#39;d be back unless someone I was with wanted to go there. I prefer more authentic vs strong and salty dishes. At least I got double points..."

The stir fry bowl bar is not big and it is difficult to fill the bowl with spinach leaves at the top.   Heavy on the sauces which are high in sodium and sugar and no caloric breakdown on their menu in house or on line.   That is important to me as a vegetarian.Disappointing that the price has increased but no improvements to the menu.  If rice and noodles were not added to the dish, there would be an extremely small portion of food to eat for dinner.    Would not return."

I ordered the stir fry (chicken and shrimp).  I kicked it up several notches with Sichuan sauce, jalapeño peppers, and habanero peppers.

We needed a halfway meeting place so we chose Schaumburg&#39;s Big Bowl location. I hadn&#39;t been to this location in awhile and was in the mood for Chinese. Service was good...nothing to complain about there. She kept the drinks and food coming.

My husband and our friends ordered their Calamari. I don&#39;t eat Calamari, but they thought it tasted great. My husband ordered a small salad and found it bland......nothing special. 

They used to have on their menu the Lemon Chicken which is my favorite! They haven&#39;t had that item on their menu for years, but if you ask for it they will make it for you. The Lemon Chicken was honestly not that great tonight. It usually has a lot more sauce and it tasted dry tonight along with the portion seeming like it was smaller then usual. I noticed towards the last bite something really hot (maybe a hot pepper was near my food while it was cooking) was in my rice. I like some heat, but this was overpowering and made me immediately grab for my water glass and do the chug. My husband ordered their pineapple shrimp and I had a taste of his. It was pretty good. He throughly enjoyed his entree.

I don&#39;t know if it was the location or what since I usually go to their Lincolnshire location, but I found my entree very disappointing. My husband and I agreed to maybe do carry out again in the near future since he passes the Big Bowl location in Lincolnshire on the way home from work. Perhaps their Lemon Chicken next time I order at their Lincolnshire location could possibly be their saving grace.....fingers crossed!

UPDATE: The GM named Sean contacted me via phone about my experience at this Big Bowl location. He took note of my experience there and provided me with a 10 dollar gift certificate via mail for Big Bowl. Please see my recent review for Big Bowl Lincolnshire."

The staff was super friendly and I loved the restaurant atmosphere. It reminded me of when I used to work at Stir Crazy with the stir fry station and menu format. The food here was way better though. Best wonton soup I&#39;ve had in a very long time. Tasted flavorful, light yet comforting and super fresh. Nothing contains msg. Kudos to that. The lettuce wraps were pretty solid as well, had to have them as an ode to Lettuce Entertain You. Warning: prices are a bit steep here. On the upside, they created appetizer happy hour from 3-6!

I&#39;d advise to check out something else. Expensive and the food was mediocre. I got the pad Thai, my kids got the orange chicken and my husband got a Thai curry dish. Does not even hold a candle to Pei Wei or PF Chang&#39;s. The sangria was mostly ice and not very flavorful. All in all the best part about this place was the fresh Ginger Ale. I don&#39;t understand how they don&#39;t have an alcoholic drink using their own ginger ale.  They should change their business model around the ginger ale. Just my opinion"

I usually go the before the cinema and never have a lot of time but if I tell them that I&#39;m short of time the food is to me super fast.

Appetizer: Thai Herb Calamari; it was good and crunchy but it felt like it could have been cooked a little longer. You can mostly taste the flour instead of the squid. 

Barbecue Scottish Salmon; the salmon itself could have been more flavorful. It also came with fried rice but it taste liked just plain white rice. Toward the end of eating the fried rice, you can taste so much pepper added. The seasonal vegetables was actually the best part of my meal. 

My friend had the All Natural Chicken Pad Thai; it had a nice tangy taste to it but it was no where close to it being like Pad Thai. 

They can work on their taste but their customer service was really good."

I got the stir fry bar which is great because you get to physically pick out the vegetables you want! For you Indians/Pakis out there, they have this orange spicy thing that is so hot it makes it a challenge (and fun) to eat your food. I drink 5 glasses of water every time I got this (I also mixed in the other spicy stuff).  

This is right next to AMC and wood field mall, so come here after that. The only reason why I give it 4/5 is because both times I asked for no peanuts but they still put peanuts on there (SO WATCH OUT FOR THAT). They did offer to take it back but when you&#39;re with 5 other people, you don&#39;t want them to wait for you while they stare at their food. Also, they are kind of slow to bring water to you once your glass goes empty (I&#39;m not speaking for myself, my friends who didn&#39;t get spicy food also had to wait a while to get water). Also, it&#39;s kind of pricey, I paid near $21 for shrimp fried rice, they charge $1 extra for fried rice. but shrimp is most expensive thing on the menu. 

overall, this place is good, but I like the experience in the city Big Bowl better."

My food and the service was outstanding just like I remembered, however my boyfriend became Violently sick within a few hours after eating there.  He had the Szechwan beef and fried rice.  I tasted a small portion of the beef and mushroom, but not the rice which i believe is what made him so terribly sick.  I called and reported the incident and they said theyd look into and that no one else had reported becoming ill.  We are hoping no one else got sick, because i came very close to calling an ambulance, i mean thats how bad it was.

Other than that, it has good ambience and good service.

We also had the mochi for dessert, since we did go when it was almost closed, we just got mango Mochi. The server was really nice and helpful.  He also gave us a couple of Cinnamon Mochi - that was really good. If you havent tried this dessert I suggest you to try - it is ice cream covered with rice covering with side of chocolate and caramel sauce. Delicious.

There&#39;s one a block away from where he lived when I met him. I don&#39;t remember how often but it seemed like he made frequent trips there for carry-out. 

When I finally had the opportunity to go back to the Big Bowl in the Gold Coast, I dined inside for lunch. I didn&#39;t realize how complicated the menu was because my boyfriend took care of ordering in the past. It has its own Yelp review. Fast forward a year to...

Monday, Nov 3, for my birthday. My boyfriend and I decided to have dinner here, in Schaumburg, to celebrate it. When we got out of his car and walked toward the entrance I started having that warm, fuzzy feeling of anticipation. I knew we were going to have a pleasant dining experience. I walked in grinning from ear to ear.

We started with an order of potstickers combo. I&#39;m used to having the appetizer come in one flavor so it was nice to be served 2 chicken, 2 pork and 2 vegetables. We had one each. I liked them all very much, I could have shared another plate.

I ordered the Mongolian Beef and upgraded my side of white rice to fried rice. He ordered some seafood plate with the white rice. 

The food is served on one plate, not intended to be shared, like most restaurants; but, I&#39;m not used to eating Chinese food this way so I improvised. My boyfriend thought it was funny that I asked for a tablespoon, chopsticks and a small dish. What I couldn&#39;t finish, he devoured.

When our Server presented us with desserts, I was taken aback by one particular item. It looked like a turd! I couldn&#39;t help but make a joke about it. After a good laugh, we decided to share the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. Wow, it was perfect! 

When the check arrived, it was much to our delight how reasonable the tab for 2 was. We&#39;ll have to figure out a way to come to this location more often. Our anniversary is in March. We&#39;ll have to keep this in mind."

I ordered the pomegranate ginger ale, the chicken dumpling soup, and beef chow fun. Everything was great! The pomegranate ginger ale is AWESOME if you like ginger (which I do), and the dumplings had some great flavor going on. The thing I really loved, though, was that the beef in the chow fun wasn&#39;t super tiny, shriveled, overcooked pieces of beef. You all know what I&#39;m talking about - that thing so many restaurants do where they buy the cheapest beef possible and cook it to death just so they can have a beef item on the menu. Yeah, this was nothing like that. Lastly, my server was super sweet and helpful, and I really enjoyed my dinner."

Their freshness can&#39;t be beat!  The majority of the time we have good experiences, hence the positive toned review, but recently I had quite a disappointing Teriyaki Chicken Fried Rice meal, so I went back to ordering the delicious Sesame Chicken with Fried Rice.  Love everything Big Bowl is about, and we frequently order take out from them!  In the summer they are a part of the &#34;Lettuce Entertain You&#34; scratch off coupons, and we used every single one we had!  They are worth at least $10 (don&#39;t know the value until a manager scratches it off) and we even had one that was $15!  This greatly helped because it can get pretty expensive very quickly here! We love their Chicken Potsticker appetizers and order them almost every time.  My husband is obsessed with their Panang Chicken Curry, yum!  Give them a try!

2014 update: *dropping from 4 stars down to 2*
&#34;Adult&#34; portion of soggy mediocre orange chicken with fries rice...meh... Absolutely not worth the almost $15! Seriously our whole order was just &#34;meh&#34; Big Bowl quality has been severely going downhill the last several months...no wonder we rarely get it anymore. In 2013 we tried to give them 2nd, 3rd,  4th, 5th+ chances and the quality has only been getting worse... Don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back anymore for this OVER priced food...
They do not do free delivery, nor do their employees do the delivering, or know much about how their 3rd party &#34;food taxi&#34; delivery all works when you call to inquire &amp; order take out...but it is a mystery extra charge... well I the end then the food wasn&#39;t even worth the drive...that I made, through a snow storm... ...and thanks for forgetting all our fortune cookies...
Fail.

Waste of my time: level over 9000

Sadly, this is now a &#34;pass&#34; for our family... waste of $50 take out tonight... cripes.

Good bye 2 stars."

But mostly because my date likes Asian cuisine. The place was full but our wait was a doable 15 minutes.  We shared the dumpling combo. I wanted more but the waiter said that our Pad Thai would make it a fulfilling meal. He was right. I ordered the chicken pad thai. It was so delicious.  I enjoyed each bite. We couldn&#39;t finish our Pad Thai because the idea of feeling bloated was not something we care for. We didn&#39;t want that going into our massage appointment.  I love the peanut sauce. We Ecuadorians also cook with peanuts. I can&#39;t wait to dig into my Pad Thai leftovers.  I&#39;m hoping there is a Big Bowl back in Florida.

I was looking forward to a nice bowl of Pho since it&#39;s been getting rather cold out.   We got there at 1pm, seated right away, service was fine, no, it was good / very pleasant.   We ordered right away and got our food surprisingly fast.    

His looked great (Beef &amp; Broccoli) and mine did, too.   
I started fishing around in my bowl  to see what it contained.   First off, it wasn&#39;t in the pretty bowl I had previously had it served in.  O well, no biggie.   But - the noodles were stiff - really difficult to eat them with out them flexing back in to straight noodles.   There were pretty bug chunks of really dried out chicken.   That was pretty disappointing.  Thank goodness for the fresh mung beans and the spicy hot red chile slices and thai basil.    Really disappointed. 

But I will be back. Out of all the times I have been there, that&#39; the only thing that has been less than an &#39;8&#39; for me."
big-bowl-schaumburg,Melanie S.,WN3FQ5lNz5q8FFbeH42OxQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,621,19,IYn9z-5GmnzcQLW1xR__wA,2.0,2014-07-08,"Sustenance was much needed after a long day teaching my niece how to drive. This involved a near-collision on Route 53, several reminders to turn the turn signal &#34;off&#34; when not in use, and gentle suggestions that it&#39;s okay to drive more than 25 mph when the speed limit is 45. Hey, at least she&#39;s erring on the side of not being a Leadfoot Louie. (Unlike her aunt.)

We headed to BB, which was my niece&#39;s choice. It was sunny out, so we wanted somewhere we could sit outside. She knows I&#39;m a hoarder of LEYE points, so it took little convincing for me to give in.

We arrived late to our reservation (because it took twice as long driving 20 miles *under* the speed limit) but we were able to get a table outside, overlooking lovely Interstate 90.

We started with their seasonal lemonade, which was strawberry. It was tart, sweet, refreshing, and had lots of chunks of fresh strawberry. So far, so good. For apps, we shared a small house salad and spicy peanut noodles. The &#34;spicy&#34; noodles were anything but. I get that they probably need to dial down the spice for certain palates, but a little heat (read: flavor) is always welcome. These noodles were bland city, and the slimy pieces of julienned cucumber didn&#39;t help. We did enjoy the house salad (although it&#39;s pretty hard to screw that up), especially the sesame vinaigrette dressing.

For entrees, we had the shrimp pad thai, sesame chicken, and roasted broccoli with garlic and ginger. I did not try the pad thai, but my niece enjoyed it (picky eater she is most definitely not). The broccoli was quite good, but the sesame chicken was downright icky. I asked if it was made with all white meat and was assured it was. It may have been, but it didn&#39;t matter much. The pieces of chicken were so comically small and over-fried that I couldn&#39;t taste anything but breading, and the sauce was cloying. I picked at it as best I could, but left most of it uneaten. To his credit, the waiter did ask if there was anything wrong with it, but I didn&#39;t feel like going into a shpiel so I just lied and said I was saving room for dessert.

What&#39;s odd is that right after that exchange, the server brought the bill to the table. I guess he assumed we were getting dessert elsewhere? I had to remind him that we wanted to order dessert. He apologized and brought the dessert menu. Nothing to me was worth the calories, but the sixteen year old would beg to differ, so she ordered the skillet brownie. I didn&#39;t try it, but since the plate was damn near licked clean, I&#39;d say she liked it.

Service was also slow. We didn&#39;t really mind as we were not on a time constraint, but the server acknowledged the long wait, which was appreciated.

I guess I have a short memory because every time I go to a Big Bowl, I have to remind myself not to go back.

Next time I entertain the thought of coming here, will someone please remind me of this review?"

That&#39;s because the quality of meats, poultry, and seafood are way better. Vegetables here are grade &#39;a&#39; quality and ultra fresh. The dishes weren&#39;t not drenched in oil. Kitchen area and floors were spotless clean. And this operation can be trusted with serious allergy concerns.  Can you say all these things about Chen&#39; Garden or China Palace, etc ?

Quality ingredients,  all natural chicken for instance,  contemporary and bright build out, s well trained staff,  and skilled kitchen crew cost money. That&#39;s what you pay for here. It&#39;s worth it to me. Another solid concept from Leye group."

I am a fan of their stir fry, several choices and a perfect amount of food. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever tried anything here that was not delicious. That being said, I have never had a positive server/hostess interaction. I dine here often. I&#39;ve gone at various times of the day. There&#39;s always a sense of irritation or plain boredom. I&#39;m not sure if the staff is unhappy with the management, patrons or what, but I have yet to ever walk through the door to be greeted with a smile."

Big Bowl is a typical Asian fusion that focuses on Chinese and Thai food with all of the above elements. I&#39;m sure some people will like this place, but for the $20 spent for the meal+tip here, it becomes extremely clear to me that my money could have been better spent elsewhere. 

As I looked over the menu my server started to ramble about how this place is apparently known for their &#34;famous potstickers&#34;. I almost wanted to laugh.  He goes on about how I&#39;m probably familiar with &#34;typical Chinese food&#34; such as &#34;orange chicken&#34; but perhaps not as familiar with the &#34;great Thai options here&#34;, aka pad Thai and about three different curries. At this point I really wanted to roll my eyes. Any place that thinks orange chicken is typical Chinese food automatically reveals its lack of authenticity.

I can&#39;t even remember what I ate specifically because it was so average. It was probably Mongolian beef, aka beef stir fry. At least it didn&#39;t taste terrible. 

I don&#39;t know about the availability of Chinese/Thai food in Schaumburg, but if you&#39;re from the city, don&#39;t waste your time."

The wait was an hour and 15 minutes (walked in at 7:15pm and was seated around 8:30pm), but it was Saturday night and I now know they do take reservations.

Our server was Jenny B. and she was great. She is everything you would want in a server - friendly, attentive, and caring. I mention caring because I have a severe seafood allergy and it was handled appropriately. She was able to quickly get a manager over to our table and inform me of my options on what the kitchen could do for me, not what I was limited to order. [This was very nice because I wasn&#39;t going out with my boyfriend to simply eat stir fried vegetables, I wanted meat]. 

Matt, the manager talked to the head chef and made sure my allergy was handled with care and he took our order personally. It took about 15 minutes for our food to come out and he also brought them to us. 

I ordered the Sesame Chicken but it had to be wok-tossed (not sesame crusted) and there was a lot of cartilage that I had to spit out.. the sauce mixed in with my rice was tasty. The portion was just right for me, but maybe a bit too small for its price. My boyfriend ordered the ginger beef chow fun and he loved it. 


If I were to come back, I hope to order something I like more. The service was great, the food was OK."

I would very often be dragged to Big Bowl by a friend who adores their Pad thai.  I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s good, but I wouldn&#39;t know since it is covered in peanuts.  I would order the Mongolian beef, which at $15 just isn&#39;t worth it. 

After a year or so away from this place I decided to give the lunch menu a try. There were less than ten options, none of which were beef or steak. I don&#39;t remember what the service was like before, but for lunch it was pretty horrific.  I waited forever for a refill and we were pretty much neglected the entire time. 

The food has always been tolerable or just mediocre. With Chef Ping just down the road, there is no reason to go to Big Bowl. Thankfully, I&#39;ve learned to say &#34;No&#34; to peer pressure and will never have to suffer through a Big Bowl dinner again!"

Its a let us entertain you restaurant so you know it will be hit or miss type resturant. I&#39;ve been here well over 50 times. I use to always do the make your own stir fry, but then one day, my cousin told me to try the Kung Pow Beef. It was all over after that. 

Ever single time I go now I order Kung Pow Beef- extra green beans and no peanuts. And with fried rice. I love it. Just something about it hits my flavor profiles right! 

I also love the fresh Asian salad, pot sticker soup, and lettuce wraps. To me its reasonably priced, drinks can be a little over priced. The food taste fresh and I enjoy sitting out side in nice weather.

We had the chinese hot and sour soup, it has lots of ingredients served inside a white ceramic bowl. Very yummy!!  The barbecue pork ribs were so delicious, very juicy and melt in your mouth, probably one of the best ribs I have had recently. The chicken pad thai was made with their special sauce, so limely, so refreshing, a great dish for the spring/summer.  I also tried their orange ginger ale, an awesome drink that is so refreshing for the summertime especially after i just went work-out.

The place is relatively full for an odd time of day, which is a good sign. The decor is nice and the staff are friendly.

When I walked in, I was lazily greeted by one of the hostesses. She didn&#39;t seem like she wanted to be here. She sat me down at my table for four for a party of one. Probably could have sat me at a different table but whatever, no big deal.

My server took over four minutes to even acknowledge my presence, even though she was helping the table right next to mine and walked by me three times before saying hi. A simple, &#34;I&#39;ll be right with you,&#34; can go a long way to making a customer feel welcomed.

Those are my only two gripes about the service. From this point forward, the manager was very nice (she came over to give me a sample of a cucumber salad since it was my first time here) and my server totally changed her tune. Maybe she really didn&#39;t see me at first, who knows. I&#39;m wearing a black shirt and this place isn&#39;t very brightly lit and is very much black and wooden in its color scheme.

Food is okay. I had the calamari appetizer and it mentioned lemon in the description. There was no discernible lemon flavor but it was fried nicely and had a good texture. Would I order it again? Only if someone wanted it.

I had the stir fry with chow fun noodles, beef, and the Kung pao sauce. That was tasty. I asked for it to be spicy and they didn&#39;t fail on that end. My mouth was tingling quite pleasantly. I asked for some lime from the guy who delivered my food and he brought that out quickly. Everyone made sure that any trash I had on my table was removed promptly (straw wrappers, etc).

To drink, I had their orange ginger ale. It was good, but overpowering in its taste. Order a glass of water so you can sip it and then dilute the ginger ale when you can.

Overall it was a good experience and I&#39;ll be coming back. I won&#39;t let one person&#39;s bad day ruin the rest of what this place has to offer."

  I ordered the pad thai and the amount of bean sprouts was overwhelming. Needed more noodles. My wife&#39;s Mongolian beef lacked beef. The pot stickers were delicious and we also ordered the banana cashew egg roll for dessert, WOW!

  The reason this place gets 5 stars is the service! My shrimp pad thai came to the table and the server immediately new it was chicken and sent it back to the kitchen so that they could quickly whip together a shrimp pad thai. Also our waitress, Carmel, pampered us. Checked on us to make sure we were enjoying out meal, and even had the manager take off the pad thai because of the wait. I tried to argue with her to get them to put the pad thai back on the bill but no matter what I said she didn&#39;t feel it was right to charge us for my meal.

The menu is great and you can experience some good Asian dishes all at one place.  They have their fair share of hot/spicy dishes, noted by a flaming mouth image, they will also warn you of any hot peppers on your plate. 

Personally I think it may be a little expensive for noodle and rice dishes but I believe the quality is there.  It is definitely a different option unlike most. If you want something in-between authentic Asian, something safe,  and something a little interesting then Big Bowl is for you."

Food
Spicy vegetable green curry ($11.95) - tasted good--had better at other restaurants...and they give you a lot...I would probably go to a Thai restaurant to get green curry though..

Portion: they give you a lot of food..so you will definitely have leftovers..

Atmosphere: Dim lit.. nice to come with a friend, friends or with family

Costs: a little bit on the costly end for the quality of food that comes out..

Customer Service: friendly service - no complaints

1.  I made a reservation and asked for a high chair.  Had to ask again when we got there.
2.  There was no toilet paper in the ladies room and the garbage was overflowing.  I told the hostess and when I went back in two hours later, it was worse.
3.  A couple in our party ordered the curry and it was way spicier than it was supposed to be.  They sent it back and when the new meal came out, the waiter slammed down the dishes and wouldn&#39;t look at them.  He then came back and when they said it was still inedible, he just rolled his eyes and walked away.  Finally, we had a manager check the sauce in the kitchen and he agreed it was extremely spicy and is was not supposed to taste like that.  After that, the waiter was fake nice.  It was bad.
4.  My dish was also wrong.  The chicken was fried instead of grilled and had cilantro on it, which I hate and was not listed on the menu. But, I ate around it so I didn&#39;t have to deal with the rude waiter.

We had really great service. When we were brought to a table the host (or manager....not sure) asked if we would rather have a booth, I said yes.

I have been here 2 times before Jim has never been . We sat in the bar area and were greeted by the manager as our server was busy . He went over the specials and the cocktail of the day which was a watermelon mojito . The server then approaches and goes over the same spiel. We both get iced tea. I also order the egg rolls it seemed expensive $8.95 for 2 but I had a taste for them. We both ordered I had the seven flavor chicken with brown rice and Jim had Kung pao. I also ordered a side of roasted broccoli with ginger . The broccoli arrived first . At first it tasted ok but I really didn&#39;t get any ginger flavor Also I though it would be roasted a bit more it seemed like it was fired on a wok with some soy sauce thrown on . It was ok but I&#39;d never order it again nothing special . The egg rolls come out and it huge it says there homemade . So i take a piece and there&#39;s a lot of cabbage mix in the middle with a little ground up chicken but really no flavor at all I tried the sweet sauce which there was barely any and that didn&#39;t help . Also the middle of the roll was wet like soggy they put too much filler in so I don&#39;t  see it ever Being cooked fully through. Very unimpressed with that . Entrees I have a plate which seemed to be all brown rice I mean  A huge portion. And some vegetables a couple peppers and some peanuts . The chicken was battered? And dried up like jerky. It actually looked like chickens feet there were about 4 small pieces.maybe 3 oz of meat . I didn&#39;t think I ordered  off the kids menu? I guess the huge portion of rice was suppose to fill me up. I know that sometimes food gets sent out to a table that shouldn&#39;t Well this definitely shouldn&#39;t of left the kitchen I hope this was a mistake . Jim&#39;s dish Kung pao was the worst he&#39;s ever had . There were 4 very small pieces of chicken and a Ton of sauce which was basically  soy sauce . Very salty dish . I seriously hope this was just a bad day in the kitchen because I can&#39;t see anyone liking the food  we were we served .

My wife really wanted to go here, and when in this area we have to go somewhere we don&#39;t have &#34;down here&#34; in the southwest/far west suburbs.

The family of 4 went for lunch and ordered drinks and pot stickers right away.  After watching several nearby tables who arrived after us receive their appetizers, we received ours at least 15 minutes after ordering.   The chicken pot stickers looked good, but were small and had 3 sauces.  

Stir fry bowls were decent, but I made the mistake of ordering spicy, and it was that and more.   Got shrimp with veggies of my choice as well as fried rice.  For $1.50 more, the fried rice option wasn&#39;t worth it-tasted more like regular brown rice.  Wife ordered scallops and shrimp with a garlic sauce.  Dish came with plain rice and while not marked spicy on the menu was just as spicy as my stir fry dish that was ordered spicy.   

Kids meals were decent-since it took quite awhile for entrees to arrive-waitress made a point several times of saying she wasn&#39;t putting in the entrée orders until the appetizers arrived.   That&#39;s fine, but considering we handed our bowls to the chefs 10+ minutes before the appetizer arrived, not really necessary.

$17.45 for stir fry with some shrimp and fried rice involved and $16.95 for the aforementioned seafood dish.   Would have rather gone to Stir Crazy across the road where we would have been better able to control the sauce and flavor levels a little, possibly have some to take home, and for a better price."

It&#39;s a great place to stop for a quick meal and then get back on the road.  The dining room is always packed at lunchtime, so I usually sit in the bar.  There&#39;s a Mongolian-style grill if you&#39;re into that, but I usually order off the menu: the hot Thai curry chicken with basil and peanuts is my go-to dish.  Yoink! That was the sound of me yanking the recipe off BB&#39;s website.  I now have perfected it, and it&#39;s one of the BF&#39;s favorite meals. 

I digress.

BB uses the most fantastic, fresh vegetables.  The service has been great each time I&#39;ve visited.  My only complaints are: 1) it&#39;s VERY noisy in the dining room, and 2) the dining room is kept at a temperature that approximates ANTARCTICA.

Otherwise I&#39;m a fan."

I realize that the ethnicity of their food is about as authentic as an Olive Garden is Italian, but I&#39;m OK with that. It&#39;s better than many of the chain options out there. They do such a good job of loading up their entrees with vegetables that you might accidentally eat something good for you; that is, if you don&#39;t have HBP or are Gluten-free. I probably don&#39;t want to know the sodium content of the Seven Flavor Chicken entree I enjoyed the last time I was here. It was tasty, but only because of the bad things hiding within. This is typically our lunch stop when we venture down from Milwaukee. We don&#39;t have a Big Bowl in our neck of the woods and P.F. Chang&#39;s doesn&#39;t compare when you are craving that suburban Thai-Chinese cuisine in a mega-mall type setting. 

We&#39;ve always had decent  friendly servers here and the curry-ness of it all keeps away most of the families with their passels of screaming kids. Probably a place I would give 3.5 starts just for being an effective corporate chain restaurant."

I had been hesitant to come here since it is a chain restaurant, but my friend wanted to come here so I did. The menu has you usual Mexican fare, so I decided on the steak street tacos because that was safe. They were pretty meiocre - no cheese, no cilantro, no sour cream, no guac. Just some salsa, pico, lettuce, and steak. And they were tiny. The cactus margarita was ok, a little too salty for my taste.

Our waitress came by a lot a first, and we were not ready, our fault. Finally when we were ready she didn&#39;t come around as much. 

You do get chips (which are huge) and salsa when you arrive. The queso is not your authentic queso, but it wasn&#39;t bad.

It was what I expected from a chain, mediocre at best. I wouldn&#39;t come back by choice, but it wasn&#39;t totally disgusting."

First off, excellent chips (unlimited!). They&#39;re fresh and warm. The dipping sauces are good too. You get the tomato salsa by default. But if you can handle the heat, then go for the green spicy dip (IT IS SPICY, so careful).

For the main course I tried the chicken empanada, chicken tinga enchilada and the spinach mushroom enchilda.  This also came with rice and black beans. The empanada and the spinach enchiladas were good. The chicken tinga tasted meh, wasn&#39;t too impressive. The Queso was awesome.

Costed like 12 bucks with tax for all of them, which I&#39;d say is a pretty good deal. Will be back for sure to try some of their other items."

So when we stopped here a few weeks ago for lunch, I decided there was no time like the present to write a review of them.

We always sit in the bar area at this particular On the Border b/c we like the atmosphere there - more lively than the &#34;restaurant&#34; area.  Of course, it was a Saturday afternoon, so it wasn&#39;t crowded or anything and we didn&#39;t order drinks, but I still felt the staff was very attentive to us...always refilling our pop and giving us more chips/salsa.

One of my favorite items is chips and salsa - something about a warm salted chip with fresh salsa.  I could die happy if that was my last meal.    On the Border is no exception as I like their chips and salsa.

I ordered the &#34;Border Smart&#34; Tomatillo Enchiladas with rice and my husband had the Sunday Special Burrito.  Unfortunately, my dish came out lukewarm and I had to send it back.  I can&#39;t tell you how this annoys me at a restaurant these days.  If you read many of my reviews, that&#39;s what my major complaint is.  Chefs need to learn how to time the cooking of the food and keep the food hot for the customers.  After my dish was reheated, it was fine, but it does put a bit of a damper on the whole meal.  The manager did come by and apologize, but still.  This seems to be a trend at all restaurants these days, and I just hope it stops soon.  My husband liked his burrito and while it was hot on the outside, that same temperature did not carry thru to the middle.

While I did not have the best experience this past meal, I would still come back to On the Border.  I like the restaurant and the food - they just need to make sure the food is hot!"

Order was ready 20 minutes late but it was during lunch rush so it&#39;s alright. I ordered a chicken bowl with no beans. When I opened the bowl it was packed with beans. It&#39;s like they confused &#34;no beans&#34; with &#34;extra extra beans&#34;. I ended up picking at food trying to fish around the beans but it totally ruined my lunch. I left a comment about my experience on their corporate website and received an automated email right away apologizing. But the following day I received a call from the locations manager. He apologized and offered to send me a gift card to make up for their mistake. Their food is really good and they make up with their customer service if anything bad happens.

Could it really be so unsurprisingly bad?  Yes.  Mostly because of the service.  We come by here often on weekends if we head to the mall or to a movie at the AMC across the street.  For the three times we&#39;ve come here (my GF really likes them from her home town) we&#39;ve always had to wait to be seated for at least 10 minutes.  This would be understandable if there was a line, but that isn&#39;t the case.  We just get stuck waiting for a waitress to come over and seat us.

Once we are seated, invariably we have to wait for 5-10 minutes for a waiter to show up and get our drink/meal order.  The food here is okay, but the annoyance of waiting twenty minutes to get an iced tea when the place is half empty and you&#39;re the only new customer coming in in the last ten minutes really gets to you.

I&#39;d say if they were willing to spend a day making sure their staff knew their areas and knew which person was supposed to seat new customers, this place would be a 3-4 star review.  As it is, I just don&#39;t want to come here again and I want to save you the trouble."

Food is a 2; it&#39;s ok, but nothing close to authentic.   Know you are getting &#34;American Mexican&#34; if you go here.  They have some good drink specials during some hours.

One of my last visits I was at the bar (only customer at bar).  There were 2 workers who just got off work and a friend of theirs at the bar also.  The off-work workers, and the working bartender were all talking about their shifts.  Making fun of customers.  How fat they are, how annoying they are, etc..  One referenced how one older ladies customers boobs were down to her waist.  Not what employees should be doing after work.  Sitting complaining about their jobs and making fun of customers; not good.  I heard one brag, &#34;I&#39;ve been fired from 4 different On The Boarders, now I am working here&#34;.  Service that day was pathetic as well.  There was a single table and myself at the bar.  Took 20mins to even catch the bartender.  When he wasn&#39;t talking with his off-work corkers he was in the back of the restaurant.  Most establishments don&#39;t allow workers to hang out at their bars.  Made for awkward experience.  Manager, at least I assume so (he was wearing button down shirt and nice pants), was there the whole time during this bad visit.  In and out of bar and all of restaurant.  Weird he didn&#39;t notice or say anything.

All in all.  Food is mediocre,  service is below par.  I would recommend finding another place for Mexican.

I am currently at this restaurant, bartender this time seems more attentive.  I was going to give 1 star, but the lady bartender on this visit got me to raise it to 2 due to her good service.  She didn&#39;t have a nametag on and I forgot to take the receipt, which may have contained her name.  If a manager or owner is reading this, on 1/13/06, at about 4:30pm, the female bartender you had working did very well.  I&#39;ve been here 2 other times at the bar with 2 different male bartenders and was disappointed with the service.

I&#39;ll update my review if I ever return and have new findings.

The food was fast, but the service was not that great, we felt really rushed... &amp; the food was super salty. 

I did like the complimentary chips and salsa though!

We ordered stuffed jalapeño poppers, 2 of the combination fajita platters, street tacos with steak, and beer battered fish tacos.

So the jalapeño poppers were decent. They came out fresh &amp; hot, but I thought they&#39;d use fresh jalapeños. They used the canned, pickled ones, which are pretty salty.

Then we got our combination fajita platters. The guac I was not impressed with. Seemed like it was made a long time ago, not that fresh. The meats (3 pieces of shrimp, steak, chicken, carnitas) were super salty. It came with this weird garlic butter. It was butter with garlic powder, salty &amp; just ew. 

The flour tortillas were good. They seemed really fresh and homemade!

The fish tacos.... the flavor was good, but the fish was cold and there was no crisp. The whole point of a fried fish taco is the crunch of the beer batter, but nope, this was a soggy mess. 

I didn&#39;t try the street tacos, but they didn&#39;t look like anything special. Just corn tortillas with chopped steak. Eh. I can get that anywhere.

Didn&#39;t like the black beans or rice. Both flavorless &amp; hard, but of course there was a ton of it on every plate.

We got cokes and when they were getting low, we were not asked if we wanted a refill, but the table next to us, got refills before they were even done or asked for them. 

Overpriced &amp; mediocre. I&#39;d go back to try the drink specials, but idk, maybe not."

If you&#39;re like me and you want walls in the restaurant you go to. Don&#39;t come here. 

Noise level is pretty average, echoes a lot, because it&#39;s a wide open space. 

Seeing this is a Mexican restaurant and Cantina, they should have Jarritos, which is a traditional Mexican beverage. But yet, they do not have it. Tsk tsk tsk, to be a &#34;Mexican Restaurant&#34; you need everything from beverages to food to the feel as you walk in. Which here they failed. Not all the Mexican beverages and the feel is more of a welcome to L.A. But for a Tex-Mex its pretty good, but for me doesn&#39;t give the feel of a place in Texas, despite the pictures of the Alamo. 

Menu: not really a lot of options, to be honest. And really over priced.  I can go to Taco Joint in Chicago and get better tacos and less over prices. Or to another place and get more tacos for a cheaper price. 9$ on average for 2. Really, a bit much. Same goes for the burritos and fajitas. Overall menu does not have enough options to be a &#34;Mexican Restaurant&#34;. 

Cleanliness: pretty up to standards. Tables clean, silverware, bathrooms, everything. Clean. I like it. 

The chips and Guacamole/salsa: the salsa has a good kick to it. So be prepared for that. The Guacamole also taste good, but needs the kick. 

My meal was the ultimate fajitas, and wow, it was filling. My steal was rare. (Look at picture) everything was delicious. Well done. Flavourful, kick, zing, and etc. 

The service was well attended, she came and checked on is multiple times. To make sure we were good. But she never refilled our beverages.
Overall, will I come back? Maybe. Just there wasn&#39;t a thing here for me to come back for certain, so maybe I come back, maybe not. We&#39;ll see."

Honestly, I had a gift card so that&#39;s why I came back. I&#39;m glad I did because this experience was much better. Despite my good experience, I&#39;ll leave up the negative review. Everything happened and people should know. 

Anyway, last weekend my husband and I decided to have lunch at On the Border before a movie. The experience was light years beyond my last visit. The host and wait staff were all very friendly. We were showed to a table on the patio and the chips and salsa never stopped being refilled. Our drinks came out lightning fast. I tried the jalapeno margarita and it was surprisingly refreshing and delicious. Try it when you visit. I had the pick three combo with tortilla soup, chicken tinga tostada and fish taco. The taco was $0.99 extra but it was very big. Definitely worth an extra buck. The tostada was crispy and delicious. The tortilla soup wasn&#39;t initially brought out to the table and I worried this would become a repeat of last time. However, the soup was brought out less than two minutes later. It was, as always, my favorite part of the meal.

My husband ordered the Baja combination and really enjoyed it. Especially the fried avocado. To sum it all up, we had a good second experience and I will go back without hesitation. Clearly, this place has gotten itself together."

Both 5 stars! Endless chips and salsa! Quick service!!! Soda refills before the last sip was done!  Various dinner entrees ordered and all were good!!

We came in on a Tuesday evening around 7. There was barely anyone in the establishment and I asked that we be sat in the bar section so my boyfriend could see the Cubs game. (Aren&#39;t I an awesome girlfriend?!?!) There were about two other tables in the section as well as a couple of people sitting at the bar. On the other side of the restaurant, there were maybe three tables of patrons. Clearly, not busy at all.

We perused the menu for about ten minutes before the server came and asked us about drinks. He didn&#39;t mention the taco Tuesday special. We had to ask about it as we had read about it in the menu. I ordered a pink lemonade and my boyfriend ordered a draft beer. It took another five minutes for the bartender to bring this very complicated drink order. Another five minutes pass before the server returns to inquire about our order. We are finally able to place it.

Here is where things about taco Tuesday are a little strange. They only ask you if you want crispy or soft shell taco and what type of meat. The price is determined by the meat. All of the images on the menu show the tacos as having cheese, lettuce, and tomato. I ordered a ground beef and a grilled chicken on soft shell. I received a chicken tinga and a grilled chicken. The grilled chicken comes with cilantro and onion. There is no information about this when you order. I immediately had to request to have it replaced. The onions were so overpowering that my boyfriend picked the taco off my plate and moved it to the other side of the table. They quickly replaced it with an American style taco. That being said, there should be an option when you order as with any standard Mexican fare. I didn&#39;t complain about the ground beef mistake because they replaced the onion-fest taco. Well, and I love chicken.

The food was all around mediocre but it was truthfully the horrifically slow customer service that will keep me from coming back."

I was initially impressed by the price per head because it was extremely reasonable. The quality of the food was great, it was just as good if not better than if we had eaten at the restaurant. Personally, I think this is a remarkable quality of a restaurant. The delivery was also on time! We ordered mini burritos, salad, chips, and guacamole for appetizers, all of which were great. The entrees were enchiladas and make your own tacos. All of the food was fresh! They even are able to supply burners and stands to keep the food warm.

RESTAURANT: 
One of the only reasons my co-workers and I even consider eating here is because of the  nice outdoor seating area they have. We&#39;ve been here 3 times this season only to be told the outdoor section is not open... (As last as July 1st) WHY?! OPEN IT FOR US!! 

FOOD/DRINK:
The food here is as expected.. Terrible. Truth is, the only other reason we used to give this place a shot is because they have $3 margarita specials.. Which are usually great as long as the server doesn&#39;t leave them to water down at the bar for 10 minutes. You&#39;re better off eating at any of the other nearby options as the food here has never satisfied.

SERVICE:
Dined-in here about 6 times, 2 of which the service was good while the other 4 visits have been a disaster. Every time I&#39;m here, we get a new waitress/waiter that we&#39;ve never seen prior. They know absolutely nothing about the menu and even less about waiting as a whole."

Food is always consistent and their drinks are very tasty.  I love their Sunday Brunch specials, $2 for Mimosas!  

Chips and Salsa are super tasty.  I do appreciate their Border Smart menu and they are good portions and I always leave full.  Service in the bar area sometimes lacks and I think its just because they are understaffed in that area, cause when I am in the dining room I have never had a problem.

Not only did the guacamole look old, had too many large onions, and tasted too sour, 2 small scoops of it on a saucer cost $7. A glass of ice tea was $3. We shared one appetizer: nachos with lukewarm chicken bits and a little beans, all covered with a terrible orange cheese sauce that was likely poured from a jar. That&#39;s all we had, and the bill, before tip, was $28. Service was friendly, a manager must have come by and interrupted our conversation 5 times - however, we won&#39;t be returning.

Seems to be more TEX than MEX. Prices are modest. Servings were very large. The Ultimate Fajita came on 2 large plates, and the Saturday special Chimichurri was large also. Food was tasty, and to my surprise, not very salty. The spice level was low except for the opening serving of salsa and chips. I had Dos Eques dark draft for the 1st time and it was very enjoyable. Don&#39;t know why they would serve it with a lime slice as that did not suit the beer well.

This was Sat early dinner and the place was nearly full. The only major negative for us was that the noise level was about as high as at any restaurant we ever visited. So this may keep us from going back in spite of the otherwise good showing. And noise probably cost them one star."

In general, the food is good, the service is excellent (it&#39;s almost impossible to get to the bottom of your drink before you get a refill), the decor is pleasant, the atmosphere is not too loud, and the restaurant is spacious. Combine this now with some other pluses: Semi-open Kitchen, tons of tvs for watching sports, awesome dish presentation, and adequately seasoned (but not too salty) food -- and you have a winner. Combine this now with great prices -- lunch specials every day till 4:00 (dinner prices are still only around $8-$12) and tons of make-your-own combination choices available (great for Yelpers who need to try as many dishes as possible per visit or those who like lots of variety).

Tortillas and salsa - Nice large, thin, and crispy tortilla chips with a salsa that is spicy enough for a little kick but not overwhelming.

Cuban torta - Nice fluffy cuban sandwich that wasn&#39;t overly salty. The crisp bread with the nice layers of meat were better than most cuban sandwiches I&#39;ve had in the area. The fries had a good flavor but could&#39;ve been a bit more crispy.

Smoked brisket enchiladas - Nice tasty beef with just the right amount of chewy cheese.

Queso chicken - Nicely grilled chicken breast with a good char flavor and sauteed vegetables that were prepared equally well. Would have preferred if the avocados did not have lime juice on them however.

Beef empanadas - Crispy and flaky with nice juicy beef inside.

While the food was good, but not amazing -- I&#39;ll be back given the great prices, awesome choices, and attentive service."

I have gone once with my wine Meetup group and recently with a girlfriend. The patio is nice in that it has comfy seating and a large fire-pit. I like their Mango Swirl Margaritas and usually pair it with queso. On my last visit, we nibbled on empanadas ($2), queso and guacamole dip ($4) and the nacho appetizer ($4). 

Service was spotty, but pricing helped to let some of it go. We had to ask for plates and extra napkins. Actually, I walked inside to get plates because our server was MIA and we were 3 appetizers in using the napkin used to roll the silverware for everything. When the waiter resurfaced, someone else was handing me plates. To which he said, everybody wants plates. Huh?!! Uh yeah, most people use plates when eating appetizers. So, he is inattentive when it comes to plates but he did make sure our thirst was quenched. We were constantly offered another round. ..... Drink service = 5, food service = 1. Food taste was a 3."

4 stars for the fajitas and 2 star for the weird shape tortilla chips. I have not been back to on the border for a long long time. Personally when it comes to mexican food, I simply cannot pass up fajitas which maybe not really a tradition mexican dish, but something about the combination of protein with tortilla and toppings that make it simply delectable. I had the mixed grill which had a little bit of everything. It is weird that they have to make you chose guac or cheese as one of your sides, but who am I to complain when the food was cooked just right and seasoned well without being too salty. The carne asade was simply divine. I ended up using 5 tortillas to wrap up all of my food. The only downside of this place is the terrible chips they use. I know they fry their own tortilas, but chips should not be bigger than your hand and shaped into a half moon. All and all great fajitas, but do something to fix your chips.

Pro: large menu, fresh items, friendly staff

Cons: terrible chips

Hidden gem: Sign up for the email club to get a free queso or empenada. They have promotions that run on certain day of the week so check the website."

I&#39;ve been to my fair share of bad, gringo &#34;Mexican&#34; restaurants, but this place puts the &#34;&#34; in Mexican.  A coworker wanted to come here for lunch, since it&#39;s fairly new and within walking distance.  I like Mexican food (read: food in general) &amp; it was a nice day, so I figured, why the heck not.

The hostess and server were both really nice and attentive, quite friendly, and I definitely appreciate that, especially during lunch rush.  The ambiance is pretty blah, your standard Americanized cantina.  If someone had led me there blindfolded and sat me down at a table, I probably couldn&#39;t tell you if I was at On The Border, North of the Border, Salseria, El Fuego Logo, Uncle Julio&#39;s Hacienda, Chevy&#39;s, etc.  There isn&#39;t really much that stands out about this place (other than the fact that you can get their branded chips in the store).

The food was an absolute salt lick.  I&#39;m not stretching the truth when I say that I had 3 glasses of water to wash down one tamale, one chicken tostada, and some rice &amp; beans.  My blood pressure hasn&#39;t been the same since lunch...

My bill was under $9, and for lunch, that&#39;s not bad at all.  When you start to add up all the blood pressure meds, doctor bills, not to mention the years off my life, if I actually make this a regular place, well, I&#39;d say it&#39;s not exactly worth it.

Next time, I&#39;ll make the drive and go to a more &#34;authentic&#34; Americanized Mexican joint in the area where perhaps the chefs aren&#39;t so heavy handed with the salt."

The waiter didn&#39;t really know the menu or what was in each sauce/couldn&#39;t articulate the difference between them.

I ordered my favorite mex dish of chimichangas and it was bland and uninspiring.

What&#39;s a girl to do when she&#39;s shopping and wants her queso fix without having to drive 15 minutes to the nearest Chilis?  Check out On The Border instead.

We&#39;ve been to On The Border a few times, and they do somethings well and some things not so much.  The (free!) chips &amp; salsa are great.  Just enough salt to the chips and spice to the salsa without being too spicy.  The queso is also great.  I usually am more of a salsa person than queso at Chilis, but here I&#39;m an equal opportunity dipper for my chips.  Don&#39;t expect the same queso as Chili&#39;s though, the queso here is more along the lines of the rotel tomatoes and velveeta type of dip.

For entrees, my friend always gets cheese quesadillas, and this place my have her favorite.  There&#39;s something about whatever they cook it in, maybe its an oil or spray or something, but she loves them.  On occasion I&#39;ve tried a piece and they&#39;re definitely good.

I always order steak tacos wherever I go, so I did that here.  I was disappointed in the tacos.  I modified what came on them to make them more in line with tacos I&#39;d get elsewhere, but they just didn&#39;t cut it.  And they were pretty expensive for what you get, when you could just go to a hole in the wall instead.  On the plus side, they let me get french fries instead of rice &amp; beans which was nice.

On another trip here I decided to try their pulled pork tacos and it became a new favorite.  Pulled pork, onion straws, this was a perfect choice.  Pulled pork isn&#39;t the first thing to come to mind when I think of American Mexican food, but it works here!

I also was a big fan of their watermelon margarita, however I believe that was seasonal.

Service here can be hit or miss.

I know we had a big party but it took them a really long time for a waiter to come to us to get our food orders. we were enjoyin our drinks but food was needed too. finally we put our orders in and everybody seemed to enjoy their meals. no complaints from anybody with their food. this place is pretty big so its definitely good for big parties.

When we arrived we had to wait roughly 40 minutes for a table, which seemed a little crazy since there were more people leaving the restaurant than entering, and there were quite a few tables open to begin with. Luckily, our waiter, Zack, was very nice and attentive, and we were served some water, and free chips and salsa, right away. The chips were very large (they were the size of half of a small tortilla) and a bit salty. They did appear to be freshly made though.

We ordered some Guacamole, which was very good, considering the restaurant itself is anything but authentic Mexican! We were a little saddened by how small the portion size of the guac was though, for the price. They have an option of Guacamole &#34;Live!&#34; where it is made right in front of you for $1 more. (Hopefully that meant there was a little more on the plate, too.)

Our El Jefe Margaritas were strong and flavorful with salt on the rim, just the way we like them! 

We decided on some &#34;Pick Two&#34; Fajitas - I ordered the Chicken and Grilled Vegetable, which cost the same as ordering just one of the two. I was pretty impressed by how good they were! I also liked that I could choose black beans or refried beans - many restaurants don&#39;t give you a choice and it could go either way (refried beans all the way!). The rice wasn&#39;t my fave, but it was better than the rice I&#39;ve had at other &#34;non-Mexican&#34; restaurants. 

The table behind us ordered some Fried Ice Cream (I think that&#39;s what it was, anyway?) and the scent of the cinnamon was so amazing, my mouth watered. I wish we weren&#39;t full so we could&#39;ve ordered.

Overall, our experience was really good! I&#39;d probably go back if I was in the area, but I&#39;d call first to see how long the wait was."

Food: 4 stars.  The food was a lot better than I expected.  Usually when dining at a chain restaurant, I expect everything to come frozen, popped in a microwave or deep fryer.  That is not what I got here, at least it didn&#39;t taste like it.  The meat in my barbacoa enchiladas was juicy and tender.  The rice was amazing.  Easily the best rice I&#39;ve ever had at a Mexican restaurant.

Service: 3 stars.  We got our chips and salsa (yummmmm) immediately after we were seated but it took until after we were done with our chips for anyone to come over to take our drink orders.  Other than the initial slow service, everything else was fine.  Our food came in a timely manner and we were checked on."

I personally asked for green (spicy) salsa, which was awesome. It was not all that hot but some of my friends thought it was hot. So I would assume it would be hot for others in general. Food was good. though,I had the combo - green chilli chicken enchillada and chicken tinga tostada, with beans and rice. That was good.  I tried my friend&#39;s fish tacos and they were really good as well. I didnt see this - but they had all you can eat tostada so that would have been interesting to try.

The only let down was - I was too full to try the desserts. But maybe next time :D. But as such - ambience of the place is good and the service is really good in my opinion. I would definitely think this is a good mexican place to have a group or a party.

I know why.

The hostess and our waiter were friendly, but that whole &#34;us&#34; thing is trite and obnoxious.  The misuse of pronouns in a feeble attempt to engendered warm and fuzzy feelings in customers is beyond nauseating.  I&#39;m not blaming the waiter.  I&#39;m sure he was trained to do that through some dead on arrival mandate from HQ, initiated by a freshman executive at corporate with an MBA from an online university.

It&#39;s &#34;What may I get for you this evening?&#34; NOT &#34;What am I going to get us tonight?&#34;

There is no &#34;us.&#34;  There is only you and me, the server and the customer.  We are not as one.

The decor is bizarre.  Bicycle seats and handlebars shaped to look like steer skulls with horns.  The place was way too bright for my liking.  It appeared fairly clean, though.  

The menu is fairly extensive.  My friend and I ordered the table side guacamole.

Our waiter was friendly.  He brought over the guacamole cart and proceeded to prepare our guacamole with dirty hands which he kept wiping on his filthy apron and the drape that covered the guacamole cart.  *hint*  Disposable food prep gloves work wonders in these situations.  They instill confidence in the diner that conditions are sanitary and they&#39;re inexpensive.

The guacamole was OK, but he hadn&#39;t stirred it, so we ran into salt pockets.  We stirred it ourselves.  That made it palatable.

The chips were tasty, but the half of a tortilla shape was inconvenient.  I like triangles, not half moons.  We again had to work for our food by tearing the chips into pieces that were small enough to fit into a human mouth, instead of a T-Rex&#39;s.

The salsa was way too spicy.  One kick milder would have been perfect.  Perhaps, they should offer two, one mild and one spicy, to cater to different palates.

We placed our order with our friendly server.  He seemed overtaxed.  I was surprised that he didn&#39;t write down our order.  Perhaps, he thought two orders would be easy to remember, the Rio combo and the Superior combo, both with refried beans.  He repeated it back to us twice.

The food came out quickly, too quickly, which didn&#39;t allow us time to finish our table side guacamole.

My order had two sides of rice, instead of one rice and one refried beans.

My friend&#39;s coffee was served cold.

My friend&#39;s combo was missing the tostada.

Everything was cold and seemed stale.

SALT!  OMG!  SALT!  No nuanced flavors.  No delightful seasonings.  Just SALT!

We grabbed the manager and waiter and explained our issues.  They said they would recrify the situation.

Moments later a guy came out with a tray with a dish of rice???, a dish of refried beans, and the tiniest tostada the world has ever seen.

So, by this time our bad food turned to horrible food.  I&#39;ve had Taco Bell with more flavor and better quality.  On The Border is what I call a microwave restaurant.  You&#39;re getting fast food at not fast food prices.

We decided to cut our losses, pay the bill, and go somewhere else.  We barely touched our food.  It was awful.

At this point, Eric, the manager, came over, apologized, comped our check, and gave us coupons to use at our next visit.

I believe in second chances and any restaurant can have an off night, so we will try again, using the coupons.

If my hunch is correct, this restaurant will close within a year.  It has that death pall over it.  To compete in this high rent restaurant row area, you have to be on your toes.  On The Border is on their knees.

Eric seems to be trying to turn around the place and genuinely dedicated to his job, but it&#39;s tough to make a silk purse out of a sow&#39;s ear."

I was so angry when I left that I felt the need to actually write a review to hopefully let management/corporate understand how their staff treats customer service. 

I went for a quick happy hour and dinner with a girlfriend of mine after work. I arrived first and quickly got seated. There were many open tables and the restaurant never filled up throughout the night. The waiter came over and asked me if I wanted a drink. 

I ordered a drink and ate the chips while my girlfriend got there. I was a little disappointed that it was $3 margarita night and my waiter didn&#39;t tell me until I got my $10 one but I can take the blame for not asking what the specials were.

The service after the food came out was the absolute worst. We came to drink and eat... Mostly drink. Not one single waiter asked if we wanted another drink even when our glasses were completely empty. Food took about 45 minutes to come out. Meh.

The worst part was that even though we never asked for the check, and after completely being ignored after our meal came out... Our waiter came with the check.
My girlfriend and I were clearly confused which the waiter picked up on. Literally asked us if something was wrong because WE were acting weird.

We were going to keep drinking if only the wait staff bothered to serve drinks. We were going to order dessert too until the waiter abruptly and randomly gave us our check. 

2 hours total. What a nightmare. Needless to say I will have a hard time recommending this place to anybody. I really wanted to like this place too. I LOVE a good margarita anyway."

The restaurant is very nice inside and it was packed. We decided against sitting outside because the waiters don&#39;t come as often and it is noisy from the traffic. We chose a booth.
My wife chose Fish Taco and I got enchiladas and the kids got some kids meals. The waitress was very polite and helpful but kept making mistakes. After a while it got very annoying. 

The food itself took a very long time to arrive and we saw people who came in after us get served. Then a manager came and apologized to us that the food got cold and so they were re-doing it. He would get the kids meals first. When the kids meals came, they had neglected to get the drink that came with it and I had to ask them to get it. Someone else served the kids meals and he banged the plates down on the table. The food for us took another 7 minutes to arrive. 

While ordering my wife changed from black beans to refried beans, but when the meal came out it had black beans. I told the waitress and she got an extra refried beans order.

The food itself was reasonably good but not outstanding. I thought the closed La Magdelena food was better. The chips and salsa were very food. My wife felt the fish in the tacos was very small.

Then came the bill. It was huge! I looked at it closely and saw that they had double charged me for everything. So they had charged me for what they threw out because it got cold, and what they actually brought out. I wanted to complain to the manager but then ended up telling the waitress and she took it inside. 

The owner lady came out and apologized and actually gave us a 50% discount on the food that we actually ate. This was a great gesture and was unexpected, so I will give them another chance next time.

Overall: 
Decor: Very good
Food: OK, not outstanding
Service: Very poor (but polite)
Price: Higher than expected"

Went here few days ago for happy hour which was a really good deal!  Ordered almost one of everything on the happy hour menu.  First came out the free chips and salsa which were delicious! The salsa had a nice kick and I was really hungry.  I downed a whole bowl of chips myself (don&#39;t judge). Anyways, I ordered a mango margarita which was $3.50 and I really enjoyed it, especially for the price.  Then after that, everything that came out was just okay and I felt very sick and greasy after.  It was a lot of chips, deep fried food, heavy queso.  Don&#39;t get me wrong it was overall fine, but I did not feel very well the rest of the night and the morning after. That is not their fault though, we did order a lot of junk.  I would probably go back just to order their regular food. I remember years back their fajita was good and I am still wondering if it is still good....

Anyways I had to give 4 stars for the food because I did enjoy myself even if I got kinda sick, but minus star for the service.  It was terrible service. I think they are new and in the process of training people, but no one ever really checked up on us and made sure we were okay, and we had to flag people down multiple times to get things we needed. No bueno."

To start with the chips and salsa were warm and cripsy.  We even got a spicier sauce which improved the overall expereince.  

To start with I had the Margarita Martini......It was absolutely delightful.  I was a little upset at the quantity given that I was paying nearly $10. 

For dinner we ordered nealy everything vegitarian.  The spinach and onion enchalada was ok, it comes a sour cream sauce that is pork based, so we opted for the Red sauce instead.  We also ordered a cheese and onion enchalada with a tomatilo sauce and the chille rellano.  Overall the enchaladas were ok.  Nothing extra special, but good enough to eat.  

The service was very good.  Our server was attentive and was well informed about what sauces were vegitarian and which were not.  I think we may go back again, mostly for the margaritas and chips."

Second the salsa is nothing special.. very watery--again unlike Chevy&#39;s which is thick and fire-roasted and full of flavor. Now let&#39;s talk about the drinks. They were OK and I would give two stars, HOWEVER I deduct one due to the HORRIBLE bartender/waitstaff. Literally took 1/2 hour to get our drinks and then delivered my food to the wrong table so I had to wait another 20 minutes to get my horribly small plate of fajitas. Which were completely flavorless and meat was chewy. My friend and I sat there as we waited for our check for another 20 minutes as our waiter sat and chatted it up with a nearby table who he obviously knew some of the people at (or just didn&#39;t give a crap about us!). Mind you, this was on a weekday evening, so it was empty and not busy whatsoever. There were literally three tables in the bar area. Now I Know why. The waiter agreed to take our food off the bill, but yet it was still on there when we got our bill. Of course when I brought it to his attention, it took another 15 minutes to revise the bill. I will NEVER go back here. We even got some coupons from the manager who was very nice and very apologetic but honestly I threw them out because our experience was THAT bad."

I&#39;ve been to this location about 4-5 times now, and my experience has been wonderful every time.

I&#39;m vegetarian, so naturally I love Mexican food (so many non-meat sources of healthy fat and protein!). What I like about On The Border is that it&#39;s more of a Tex-Mex style of cuisine, so it&#39;s a little different from the other great Mexican food in the area. Some of my favorite things to order have been the super chunky queso dip as an appetizer, taco salad (meat replaced with veggies), the avocado enchiladas, and mushroom &amp; spinach quesadillas. I also really enjoy their margaritas (they do NOT skimp on the tequila, believe me).

As far as the service goes, I have had wonderful attentive, enthusiastic service every time I&#39;ve visited this restaurant. What I really appreciate is that the servers go the extra mile for vegetarians. Every time I order a meal that has no meat, they immediately ask me if I am a vegetarian and then automatically ensure that everything included in my meal is vegetarian friendly (i.e. no refried beans, or replacing meat with vegetables). My only qualm with the service is that someone comes by seemingly every 5 minutes to ask you if you want more chips and salsa. Leave the chips alone, I&#39;ll tell you if I want more!

The ambience of the restaurant is really nice, open with lots of quirky little design elements. I love On the Border for brunch, lunch, and dinner!"

I decided to try it again due to the amazing meal we had on our initial visit.  While I was still satisfied with my meal this time, there were a few issues throughout the night. 

One thing that was different about this visit was the fact that there were far less employees there.  After my first visit, I was amazed at how teamwork oriented the staff was, but this time, no teamwork was witnessed and managers were near nonexistent.   

The border sampler was not as memorable as it was the first time and I&#39;m 100% sure the cooks forgot to put the chicken flautas.... for a $13 appetizer, forgetting even the smallest item is extremely disappointing :(

The barbacoa enchiladas were as good as the last time, but came out luke-warm.  The flavor is still great and I would definitely come back for them.  

On the Border needs to pull itself together if they plan on staying in the extremely competitive Schaumburg area, especially with the opening of other Mexican restaurants."

We were seated fairly quick by the bar. We waited about 10-15 minutes for someone to come up to us with menus, no biggie I guess.
Our waitress was rather casual with us- trying to be friendly. Fine. After she let us know that her and another girl would be helping us I ordered and beer and my husband got a water.
When she came back with my beer- my husband apologized and said he changed his mind and asked for a beer as well.
To this, the waitress replies &#34;Oh you bitch&#34;.....i don&#39;t know if she felt that she could speak comfortably with us...but it wasn&#39;t appreciated.
She comes back with his beer and claims that she dropped his lime...with a laugh...and never brought a new one? Really?
Whatever I guess. I tried to chalk it up to having a ditzy waitress.
The OTHER girl finally comes to our table to take our order about 20 minutes later and I got another beer. 
The first girl that helped us brought me 2 beers and said they had a miscommunication and opened two beers so one is on the house. Ok- this makes up for things. Until I noticed that one of the beers had a chipped rim and the chipped pieces were IN the beer bottle......
Now I see why I got a freebie.
I guess I could&#39;ve complained about the danger of someone serving glass filled beer, but I never saw our waitresses again the entire night.
We were served our food by a kitchen worker and were extremely disappointed that neither of these dishes came with sour cream or guacamole. Really? MEXICAN FOOD with no sour cream or guacamole??? I even got a combo platter (Superior Dinner) and EVERYTHING on that plate would&#39;ve been complimented with it....but I was given queso dip with it? Gross.
Like I said- I could&#39;ve asked for some (and paid extra?) but I never saw our waitresses the rest of the night. 
Once we were done eating, we had to hunt someone down at the bar and ask for our check or we would&#39;ve been sitting there for a good amount of time.

I&#39;ve eaten at this location once before and didn&#39;t have a bad experience, so I suppose I&#39;m not complaining about the restaurant in general- but the 2 girls that helped us that night should be fired. They&#39;re a detriment to your restaurant. 

So disappointing and such a waste of money."

We arrived just after 12 on a Friday and were promptly seated.  My colleague told our host and server that we are on a schedule and needed to be out before 1.  Our server responded that they could have us out &#39;in half an hour&#39;.  

We placed our order for two cokes and we each got the bottomless tacos for $8.99.  Some complimentary chips and salsa arrived.  A few minutes later we finally got our drinks.  And then we waited.  And waited.  After about twenty minutes our server came by to ask if we needed any more chips, which we did not.  Finally, thirty minutes after ordering, our tacos arrived.  

The tacos definitely hot and fresh as were the beans and rice.  We quickly devoured our first three.   Our server came back and asked if we would like refills on our tacos and we said yes, but they would have to be to go.  This time, the turnaround on the tacos was all of five minutes.  Why they could not have been as swift the first go around, I&#39;ll never know.  They were definitely not busy.

We got our bill settled and were out the door at exactly 1 p.m.  There was no mention of our food taking an extended amount of time, just a &#39;see you next time&#39;.  
Not likely, since we were late for work.

The bottom line:  the food was okay if overpriced, be prepared to drop about twenty bucks on lunch, and the service was slow.  
If you want tacos in Schaumburg, go someplace authentic,
or go to Quedoba, Panchero&#39;s, or Chipotle."

Stopped on a Sunday night a 6pm. Place about half full or a little less. Lots of employees walking around, but still 10+ minutes before I was approached. Ordered beverage and food when the waiter finally approached. Waited another 15 minutes, still no drink. Flagged down employee walking by who got the drink for me. Food arrived about 5 minutes after drink.

Once helper delivered my food to the table, never saw anyone to refill my empty soda and water. Had to flag down someone to get bill.

Like really, your salsa was too spicy and they used pronouns? Comon.

Either way, came here with the girlfriend on a Saturday night and it was pretty crowded. We waited 10 minutes and got seated and it did take a bit to get served. We knew they were busy though, and waited patiently and got a waitress that seemed overworked but trying her best. She got our orders right, checked up on us and overall did as good a job as she could. 

The food was great. Gf got portobello fajitas and I got a burger. I do wish I&#39;d gotten something more Mexican, but I was just feeling a burger at the time. The chips and salsa they give you for free were also good. I love spicy, but the salsa wasn&#39;t that spicy to me, as that other one star reviewer said. I would&#39;ve even preferred it hotter. We decided to get the spicy queso dip with habanero and jalapenos in it, and it was amazing. I would honestly come back just for that.

All in all, give this place a chance if you enjoy Mexican food. Some of these one star reviewers are extremely picky, but I&#39;d give this place a four out of five."

I usually like sweet stuff but I didn&#39;t really like this. My second margarita I had the Borderita Grande and it was delicious. Wish i would have ordered it first.
Ordered the guacamole appetizer, guac was very average. It wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t great either. 
For dinner my boyfriend and I split the ultimate fajita. It was delicious! We both eat alot and we had leftovers even. My friends ordered the brisket tacos and they enjoyed them as well.

She was busy being a chatty kathy with the couple next to is because they we her friends.  She blamed the bus boy for not bringing more salsa. It took her an additional 15 minutes for that. We had ordered our son&#39;s food when were seated do he had eaten. We waited another 20 to 30 min for my husband&#39;s and my food and just said fuck it because our son was getting tired of waiting. 
     I found a manager and told him the issue he just told us to leave and not worry about paying for our son&#39;s meal.

Super attentive staff, without being intrusive.  They were willing to re-pour some shots that looked a little light.  Note the person observing that happens to be a multi-year restaurant background.  So it&#39;s one of those things that he just &#34;knew&#34; so he mentioned it, and they fixed it!  :)  

The leftover factor, is delish!!!


My GF and I shared a two pitchers of frozen strawberry margaritas (one with the pomegranate meltdown shots over it)  I had a yummy cup of chicken tortilla soup (and somehow a second one magically came with dinner, they left it at the table, unfortunately I ran out of room.   We had some chips and salsa, chips n queso (queso doesn&#39;t have a long shelf life at the table, I ran late, so it wasn&#39;t as delish and it should have been, and assuming was because it was almost gone when I got there)  

We shared the....

La Bandera - $10.49
A Pulled Pork (Carnitas) Enchilada with green chile sauce, a Slow-Cooked Pulled Chicken Enchilada with fresh sour cream sauce and a Shredded Beef (Barbacoa) Enchilada with ranchero sauce.


I honestly didn&#39;t have a bite of any of it prior to leftovers, but my GF loved it!  :)  

I have such a left over amount of food, I have started to dig into it today, and will finish it on Monday.   Super yummy food, service was great, atmosphere is nice.   Looking forward to dining here again!  :)  

Note: With all the booze at the table, with tip we were around 170ish for five people.   But we tipped very well for the service.   So, per person, with booze approx 35ish...  Not too bad at all, with drinks.    That was *with tip* so really not too bad at all."

I bought a groupon for a pizza dinner for two - including two desserts and an appetizer - when i tried to use it i was told pizza was not available. I was then told to pick from middle eastern, which we like, but then was told the entrees cost more than the (*not available) pizza, and was given a hard time over the appetizer, asked for 2 waters, was given 1 (tap water would have been fine). Was then told the hummus was old and not good...

Sigh... i give up. At this point, reluctantly agreed to two entrees and some samosas, but honestly i became concerned they&#39;d spit in our food or give us something old or bad to deliberately make us sick, so we just left. Enligh unpleasantness at that point. 

And went to another restaurant. So i got to pay for dinner twice tonight.

If a business doesnt want to or cant honor groupons, them simply just dont sell them. 

I have no problem paying full price, but i hate a bait-n-switch.

I am a huge fan of Indo Chinese food , and this place delivered exactly what I was looking for from a long time.
Most of the Indo Chinese places put too much sugar and vinegar in their dishes which I am not a big fan of ,I love how  this place had authentic spicy savoury sauces which was neither sweet nor sour.
We ordered lunch specials Bhazzia Manchurian &amp; Chilli Chicken . I was expecting them to be super spicy after reading other reviews but they were mild to me .
We also got fried spring rolls and soups with our lunch specials
Manchow &amp; Hot and Sour soups were great.
Bhazzia Manchurian was excellent , i loved every thing about it, no wonder its their best seller. Its basically Vegetable Manchurian in other places but called Bhazzia( fritters) here .

Hakka Wok is Indo-Chinese cuisine which can be best described as Chinese (Cantonese/Szechuan) cooking techniques paired with Indian herbs and spices. 

These dishes are spicy - no joke. The little red icons next to 90% of the items on the menu aren&#39;t decorations. Those are actually to signify between spicy and fireball hadouken out of your @#$ spicy. 

I would recommend the cumin beef - it&#39;s the perfect blend of earthy, savory, salty, and a little spicy. For an appetizer, try the baby corn bhazzia. It&#39;s baby corn that&#39;s been seasoned with spices and then dipped in batter and fried. It&#39;s served with a spicy sweet and sour sauce made from lime juice. For a bold spicy dragon punch in your face dish, try the chicken 65. It&#39;s fried chunks of chicken tossed in cumin, garlic, onion, and chilies. It has a rating of two chilies so be careful. The one downside is that the food portions are smaller for the price you pay - most dishes are in the $10-15 range. 

If you like bold spicy food and are looking for something new, then Hakka Wok is worth trying. Just don&#39;t come here expecting pad Thai or orange chicken. Otherwise, you&#39;ll miss the point of enjoying Indo-Chinese cuisine."

They completely forgot to put the 2nd noodles box in the bag even though they did not forget to charge me for two noodles.  I had to go back to the restaurant to get the refund.  The second issue was that the food was very very spice (even though we had told them to make it mild).  Even the lady who took the order had written on the receipt to make it &#34;less spicy&#34;.

Hakka-Wok offers many Indo-Chinese dishes (appetizers, soups, entrees, noodles) which will remind you of the Chinese food which you may have had in India or in the Middle East. In many cases the food is more flavorful and delicious, offered in a decent ambiance and setting. 

The place is small but decent for a small family. The serving staff is warm and make you feel comfortable. Service is a bit slow, but your food is made to order. Don&#39;t expect a quick in and out.

Indo-Chinese is a niche market. It consists of Indians and Pakistani&#39;s who like Chinese dishes but not the authentic or American-Chinese food. The people from subcontinent simply do not like the authentic Chinese food, as it is very bland and frankly disgusting.

Indo-Chinese fusion food does not look disgusting like authentic Chinese food and it caters to the taste buds of the niche market.

There are some restaurants which claim that they offer Indo-Chinese. Some of them can stake a claim, however they are expensive (ex: Bombay Chopsticks) and some simply make the claim (not naming any names) with no real offering.

You should definitely try Hakka Wok if you like Indo-Chinese. You will be pleasantly surprised and will become a repeat customer."

- HOUR long wait to get our food with 3 people on the floor for only 6 seated tables
- mediocre food, gloppy multipurpose Chinese food sauce
- explosive bathroom trip when getting home - sore stomachs the next morning
- desperately needs adult supervision

Seriously, Bombay Chopsticks is down the street.  Save yourself from a bad night (and morning).


Our party arrived around 8:50PM last night and requested a table for four.  We proceeded to wait 20 minutes for a totally empty table to be cleared.  Eventually we just sat down after they took the dishes.  One of us had to get up and request someone from the front come wipe down our table because flagging down a server was impossible.  The guy who wiped down the table brought out a wet rag, wiped the table, left us with a wet table to go get a dry rag, came back to dry the table.

We waited another 15 minutes until going up to the front again to request someone to take our order.  Once they came we placed the full order instead of starting with appetizers, etc.  As he was walking away we had to shout out that we&#39;d like some water too.

In total, it took an hour between when we could have been seated and when our food actually came.  What shocks me about the awful service was that there were 7 seated tables and 3 servers on the floor.  How is this possible!

Once we got the food, it was ok but not great.  The fried rice was bland and the chicken lollipops had almost no seasonings.  The paneer 65 was good but everything else was this gloppy, generic Chinese food sauce they could have put on everything.  It was fireworks when we got home and a few of us still have stomach aches the next morning.  This memory is enough to deter me from returning.

I would never go back to Hakka Wok especially with Bombay Chopsticks right down the road.  Save yourself the hour wait, the bland food, and the miserable bathroom trip after."

It was our second time dining at the restaurant. The reason we went back was because the first time was fantastic. This time even though there were only three parties there, it still felt like the service was very slow. There was only one girl waiting the tables and taking take out orders by herself. Now knowing only three parties were in the restaurant, we should have gotten our food fairly quick but it took forever to get our food. 

First the water they served was stale and warm. Who the heck wants to drink stale and warm water on a jot and humid summer afternoon? We had to ask for ice. But the thing that got me was they&#39;ve done this before. The first time we came to hakka wok last September, they gave us warm water. Moving forward, the plain chicken lollipops were definitely not worth it. Way too over priced. We ordered plain steamed rice and chilli beef and orange chicken with gravy. The Orange chicken was way too sweet. The chilli beef wasn&#39;t even a bit spicy! Why do they call it that? 

The only thing positive about this experience was our lovely server. She was very kind and attentive. Im still shocked by the lackluster food. The first time we came to hakka wok we tried the fried rice. It was amazing but when ever we go to any Asian restaurant, that&#39;s all we get. So we thought we try something different this time around and now I regret it for sure.

Again, they don&#39;t have a reputation of being bad but our experience today was ...pretty bad."

I knew it was going to be expensive from other reviews and menu prices but I was not prepared for the utter lack of value Hakka Wok disappointed me with.

We ordered for take out and arrived to pick up the food at dinner time.  I was surprised to find the restaurant completely devoid of customers on a Friday evening during prime dinner time.  I&#39;ve had mixed experiences with restaurants that were empty so I decided to not let the negative image of an empty restaurant skew my opinion of the food.  That is, until I was presented with a $27+ bill for two entrees: paneer in Manchurian gravy and the &#34;famous&#34; dry chili chicken.  Wow.  I asked to see an itemized bill or menu to confirm prices and while doing so, the only employ in the restaurant expressed his personal opinion that &#34;this place is overpriced.&#34;  A omen of things to come but I again attempted to hold my judgement till after I ate my meal.

After getting home and unwrapping our food, I balked at the paltry size of the entree containers.  They were the size of small containers typically used at the many Chinese take out places in the area.  At this point I felt the dreaded fingers of doubt wrap around my hungry stomach and squeeze the reminder of the $27+ bill I just paid into it.

On to the food... the rice was of the cheap Chinese variety except it was stiff and dry.  Have you ever tried to eat Chinese rice the next day after it has been in the refrigerator overnight? That&#39;s exactly the consistency our rice was except it was warm.  At this point I was getting angry and I hadn&#39;t even tasted the paneer or chicken yet.

The chicken was lightly breaded, as dry chili chicken should be, and looked okay but it must&#39;ve either been overcooked or old because it was dry.  Not only was it dry but it was disappointingly not spicy.  Maybe that&#39;s why they gave us three containers of hot sauce?

The paneer was strangely chewy and scarce, swimming in a bath of sauce.  Although the Manchurian gravy is labeled as spicy, it wasn&#39;t really that spicy at all.  I&#39;ll admit the flavor was decent and had potential.  Fresh, minced cilantro really helped freshen up the corn starch stiffened sauce.

I now realized why this place has a severe lack of business.  Not only were the prices high but the portions were relatively small and lacked any significantly unique or superb flavor.  I don&#39;t know how long this place has been around but I can&#39;t imagine it staying open for very much longer.  It&#39;s one thing to raise perceived value of your product by applying a lofty price tag but it&#39;s a crime to deliver an underwhelming experience attached to a severe lack of value to your product.  I think it is obvious that I won&#39;t be bothering to spend anymore money to try anything from this place again."

I was extremely saddened by the closing of Hot Wok Village ((RIP)), but was ecstatic to discover Hakka Wok. Sadly, I was hoping that my review would be at least a star higher, since this fairly new addition to Schaumburg is owned and operated by the previous manager and executive chef at Hot Wok Village. Sigh... I think I&#39;m still torn between 3 and 4 stars.

I went with a friend for dinner and we decided on sharing a few dishes so we could try more than one or two things ((the smart thing to do)). We each ordered a veggie spring roll. She prefers the spicier things in life, and ordered hers Szechuan style. We both agreed we loved them. I also went for a cup of veggie wonton soup. It was standard. Nothing special. For our entrees we ordered the Singapore noodles with chicken and Kung Pao tofu. The noodles were delish and had just the right amount of curry. You could also tell the chicken was extremely fresh. The Kung Pao Tofu left me with mixed emotions. The flavor was good, but there wasn&#39;t much in the way of sauce. It was more of a dry rub. The tofu was also fried which wasn&#39;t indicated on the menu. There also appeared to be way more tofu than veggies. 

Since my bf was at home wishing he was out for girls night ((well, at least at Hakka Wok)), I decided to do a good girlfriend deed and bring him home dinner. He wanted an order of the Chicken Lollipops and Manchurian Noodles. He apparently loved them both. I tried the Manchurian noodles and thought they were good - but felt it was just your standard Lo Mein noodles with a kick. Meh.

The prices are fairly reasonable. Especially for the amount of food you get. Service was also good. A few things to note...just about everything on the menu is spicy. So if spice isn&#39;t your thing, or maybe just a little bit of it is, speak up. They&#39;re more than willing to make accommodations. They also have a ton of vegetarian options, which makes people like me super happy. 

Overall I had an okay experience. It was good enough to give Hakka Wok a second go - primarily since I&#39;m still craving the ginger fried rice I passed up and use to love at HWV. It&#39;s also fair to say the Hot Garlic Wontons and Paneer 65 have been calling my name since I left. I suppose that&#39;s a sign I need to return for another try."

The whole thing lacked flavor with the chicken pieces swimming uninterestedly in the soup. It was hot is the probably the kindest thing to say about it. Now dinner: husband ordered the chicken lollypop. Yeah, it was all right. Heavily coated though with the batter. Missing that light touch. The Manchurian beef and the fried rice were okay a tad on the salty side. Overall I just want to say: meh. If I lived close by, maybe I might have tried again. 

What I will suggest is: arrive early! Like 7, 7: 30 ish for dinner because it gets packed!! By eight people were waiting outside with wailing, hungry kids. 
Also service might get a little on the slow side as the wait and crowd increases. I mean I didnt mind because he seemed like a harried fellow but if you are REALLY hungry it will probably be annoying!"

Well this is an Indian-Chinese joint and the food is a bit different.

We all started with some Man Chow Soup, which was a very hearty soup, with crunchy noodles and cilantro (which gave great flavor).  And yes, that&#39;s what it&#39;s actually called.

- Chili Beef (dry): pretty good, had a good kick.  You could really feel the heat inside.
- Mongolian Trio: shrimp, chicken, and beef, which was really good.
- General Tsos&#39; Chicken:  A bit different then the traditional battered nuggets.  These were lightly breaded thin pieces of chicken, in a tasty light sweet sauce.  I reminded me more of Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken.
- Burnt Garlic Fried Rice w/ shrimp:  Had good sized pieces of shrimp mixed in.  It was a heaping plate of tasty garlic fried rice.  I probably wouldn&#39;t have this for lunch before returning to work.. super garlicky.

It was a bit pricier than your average Chinese restaurant, but these aren&#39;t your typical dishes.  We had prompt friendly service and drinks were frequently refilled.

The menu looks very similar to what HKV had, but with some new items.  We decided on the fried pork dumpling appetizer and green Thai Curry Chicken, both of which were really good.  The veggies really soaked in the green curry flavor and the chicken was good quality."

The food is almost identical to the food served at Hot Wok Village.  The dishes, I would say were improved upon. I immediately noticed the quality of chicken they used is much better.

The Manchow soup was a perfect start to my lunch considering how cold the day was.  The broth was rich and spicy.

The Szechuan noodles are just as I remembered them.  Spicy with just a hint of sweetness.  A very unique dish you wouldn&#39;t find at a Chinese restaurant.

My favorite dish though, is their signature Chili Chicken.  The exemplary Indo-Chinese dish is their best as well.  The crunch of the onions, and the bite of peppers play a great complement to the very savory, satisfying chicken.  Dont&#39; waste your time at Bamboo Garden.  Come here."

We ordered bunch of items. including Chicken Corn Soup,Chicken Pakora, Fried Chicken Momo, Mongolian Trio, Mongolian Beef, Honey Sesame Chicken, General Tso&#39;s Chicken, Hakka Chowmein, Szechuan Chicken &amp; Chicken Fried Rice.

First of all the service is very bad. The restaurant filled up really fast and the Kitchen staff fail to handle the orders. We had to wait almost 30 mins for appetizers. front of the house was also having a nightmare with a huge crowd. The guy serving us was asked at least 5 times for cold water, but he failed to get it to us. I finally had to go to counter and ask him. Same thing with the serving plates. Fried rice ... All I can say I had better. Now let&#39;s focus on other stuff. Star of the food was Mongolian Beef, Excellent taste and presentation. Very tender chunks of Beef. All the family liked this place. Yes I would go back.

They seriously need to focus on training their staff. The staff was lost and dumb founded to see a large crowd. They need to get some extra plates. As the guy was cleaning the plates with a table cloth napkin standing behind the counter for the guest who were waiting for the food.

Over all I would recommend this place for food but... it lacks service. Ambiance is OK."

Its Super hard to find this place since their Main sign was off or broken when it was dark when I went to find this place.  

The service was very slow, it took about 45-1 hour to get our food when the place was Empty when we arrived ( they appeared to have some rush delievery) orders that were slow as well that went ahead of us). 

The food did not impress us as it was more expensive than other places like this and not as tasty.  IM not sure why i would spend that much on a meal when there are better places a few miles away for better prices and faster service.

They were very friendly with the service and even offered to give us another dish for free, but we simply could not wait for them to cook another.  

I would have like to try them again but since they were slow and food was not great nor were the prices I don&#39;t think it would be worth the trip. I&#39;d pass and just try my other favorites. I wouldn&#39;t give them another chance unless they make alot of changes.

Also the dining area was quite cold since they left one of the doors open for some reason.  And their choice of dining music was a little strange to me."

Wow, our waitress did not know half of the items on the menu. She also stood there when we were signing our bill which made us uncomfortable when we are trying to decide how much tip she should get.

My friend is a vegetarian and I am not. I ordered a chicken wonton soup and she ordered the vegetarian wonton soup. When we asked her which soup is which, she said well just try it and you can switch it out since I can&#39;t tell the difference between the wontons. Thank god the manager was there and he said I make the wontons so I know which is which. When I asked my friend did she eat enough the waitress was there to answer for her.

I&#39;d describe this place as &#39;good Indo-Chinese food that won&#39;t break the bank.&#39; As others mentioned, the restaurant is small with ~10 tables but I liked it cozy. The service was good albeit a little slow as the place was packed. 

Also an offer for a free egg roll popped up when I checked in. The waitress was really confused about it and had to ask the manager about it which took forever. I guess we were the first ones to check in and us the offer.

That being said, never saw a peep from her till the end of our meal.When she came with the check and some carry out I ordered, she told me she put the spring roll in the bag in a very nonchalant almost rude way.I was like whatever...its just a  spring roll, be nice. I got home and unpacked the carry out and guess what...that spring roll was the size of my middle finger......just too much hassle for such a  measely morsel.

Oh the food was awesome! At the restaurant we ate Shrimp Pakoras and Chicken soup. The carry out was Manchurian Chicken, Chilli chicken, Shrimp with Black bean, Manchurian Fish, Hakka Noodles and House fried rice...no complaints in the quality or quantity of the food.

The service: horrible- 1 guy and 1 girl bussing and taking orders. took us 10 minutes to get a menu! food came out relatively fast. asked the girl if they had fountain soda/pop... she had no clue what that was, so i asked for a can of coke... which she never brought, made no mention of, didn&#39;t even wink an eye indicating she realized she forgot it. brought the bill before they even asked if we were done or wanted to pack up left overs, which we had to pack ourselves after asking for the box. and no hello, how are you, welcome or goodbye, thank you. HORRIBLE SERVICE.

The food: tasted good, spice was on point. portions were dismal. for the price of each entree, the serving size was pathetic. 15 pieces of small cut up chicken in the chili chicken- not acceptable. haka noodles barely enough for one person, let alone sharing it between 2, we also ordered G,TSO paneer.

Their Hot &amp; Sour soup is among the best I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ve only been there during the lunch hours recently so service is always good as it isn&#39;t so hectic. The Pakistani/Indian fusion is mixed in beautifully. Orange Chicken is real Orange Chicken unlike other restaurants claiming to be authentic. I highly recommend the lunch special - good portion size at a very reasonable price.

I&#39;ve never even HEARD of manchow soup but it was deliciously spicy.  The beef was tender, the broccoli was crisp tender, and when I asked them to make it spicy, they even included a side of hot chili sauce on the side.  Delicious, worth the $8 lunch and plenty to have the next day."

First and LAST time my husband &amp; I visit this place.  We ordered shrimp fried rice SPICY... specified more than 3 times and chicken Manchurian gravy spicy. The rice were not spicy at all .. completely white... and the &#34;spicy&#34; Manchurian was sugary! !! When we  told the ONLY hostess this she ignored .. asked for my bill and told her we refuse to pay for something we didn&#39;t order and didn&#39;t eat she called her boss &#34;Joe&#34;. He in turn told her to have the cook make it spicy....EW .. what&#39;s the point when you are already disgusted. .? I had to personally call the owner with my cell and demand he take the charge off.... really unprofessional and just a terrible experience all together. . Oh and I didn&#39;t mention that 4 carry out order people had to wait until all of this was sorted out. .. terrible. I&#39;d rate 0 stars if I could!

One time the sub was put together poorly so it was a mess trying to eat it and the whole thing fell apart, another time they put green peppers on it when I didn&#39;t ask for them and then looked irritated when I asked her to take them off, etc. Is it really that hard to make a sub? Also the owner doesn&#39;t seem very friendly and is it really that hard to believe I don&#39;t want chips and a drink with my sub?? And yes I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t want a cookie.

It has become, I guess, the new cool place to hang out, the &#34;It&#34; place, in the Schaumburg area.  

All the pastries from this Asian-French patisserie are yummy.  The best thing about them is that they are not as strongly sweet as those sugar-bombs we usually find in American bakeries; they are only mildly and subtly sweet, and I&#39;m pretty sure that the amount of sugar used is much lower. 

Please try their various croissants and donuts (especially, the ones stuffed with sweet red bean); and croquets.  I bought some cakes from there, too; my family devoured them."

I keep trying this place every once in a while hoping it gets better, but everything just gets worse and worse. It used to be so good in the beginning. On top of that everything is so expensive. I hate spending $50 for just a couple things of baked goods that don&#39;t even taste that great. Like I can get a meal for like 4 people with that. I have to say, I did think it was worth it when they first opened, but not anymore :/

I got a cloud cake for my mom&#39;s bday a few months ago and while it looked impressive, the flavors were just mediocre as well as the size was kinda small. Not really worth the $40. 

Another time I got the green tea roll cake and it wasn&#39;t that good either. Tasted like nothing and I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sweet bean filling. It overpowered the delicate flavors of the cake and cream which were almost nonexistent anyway.

I got a chicken salad sandwich last week because it looked really good and it was disgusting. Not a lot of filling and they put one slice of unripe avocado in each half of the sandwich. Did they think nobody would notice?? Took me a while to figure out what it was and it was not pleasant. Idk if you&#39;ve ever had unripe avocado but it&#39;s gross. Slimy almost and weird, crunchy, almost plastic texture.

I wish I still liked this place, but I&#39;m just really over the expensive prices and the quality that just keeps getting worse. 

I know a lot of people that have stopped going because of those reasons. 

Also the service is half good half bad. I feel like the owner is sweet. She&#39;s the only reason I&#39;m not giving 1 star, but one of the daughters is rude as f and some of the employees are rude too. We&#39;re buying expensive ass bread, relax!"

Their baked goods are lined up in beautiful display cases and encompass all sorts of sweet and savory items. I truly was like a kid in a candy store attempting to figure out what everything was and what I wanted to get. I was honestly just stopping in for some coffee and a place to get some work done on my lap top, but their tasty eats were too tempting to resist.

I followed the lead of one of their regulars that was browsing and grabbed a tray and tongs for my selection. Along with the cased baked goods, they have packaged items to take home as well. I decided to try the twin egg pastry. This little gem included a delectable flaky breading with two hard boiled eggs nestled inside. The best part? Whatever was drizzled on top! I honestly couldn&#39;t pin point it, but maybe like a honey and wasabi concoction? I could be way off, but it was definitely sweet with a complimentary bite to it.

I took my treat up to the counter and finished my order with an iced vanilla latte ($8 total for everything). I&#39;m not sure what kind of coffee they use, but it was pretty good! They heated up my sandwich and my coffee took less than a minute to prepare. There is plenty of seating and free WiFi which is always a plus. I wouldn&#39;t hang around too long though, those wooden benches can really take a toll on your tush!

It&#39;s to be noted that there was no background music playing in the cafe when I stopped in. I was totally prepared (thanks to Nicole W&#39;s review) to hear the same song on repeat, but instead received absolute silence. It was a tad awkward, but I didn&#39;t mind it too much because I had some calls to make. Plus I brought my earbuds anyway.

Moral of this little tale... stop in for beautiful and delicious French-Asian baked goods!"

It&#39;s a Korean bakery with some of the Korean classics but it has a Euro French type of spin on everything. Most things are a bit more fancy than a standard Korean bakery. One of my besties brought me some treats from here yesterday and thanks to sharing with coworkers, I was able to try many items. First, they have adorable boxes, packing and even included candles &amp; a plastic knife for the cake my friend purchased. Adorable!

My friend purchased a mocha cake for me and it was just beautiful. The amount of detail in the decoration was just fabulous!

Their double chocolate cheescake is delicious. They package everything so cute and elegantly that I felt kind of bad eating it. But I did devour my piece of pie in seconds so maybe I didn&#39;t feel too bad. It&#39;s not the rich and indulgent chocolate our western tastebuds may be used to, but it&#39;s delicious nonetheless.

I also tried a few of their macarons and they were great! I enjoyed the chocolate best of all since I&#39;m a chocolate fein but the pistachio and others were also tasty. The filling was good, as was the cookie bit and they had no issues with dryness which I often see with macarons. 

I can&#39;t speak on the prices or service as all of my goodies were brought to me, but as far as presentation and taste - I&#39;d say Tous Les Jours is top notch!"

The moment you walk in, you&#39;re delightfully overwhelmed with an abundance of aromas and wall-to-wall glass casings of delicious pastries and breads. Anything you can think of, you can find. Sweet? Savory? A &#34;Frank&#34; (hot dog) in a croissant? It&#39;s all at your fingertips. In a difficult decision, I settled on a cream-strawberry croissant, which was literally so rich and full, I needed a fork and knife to eat it...yum! 

The cafe itself is spotless, and my boss and I loved grabbing a plate of pastry to enjoy while we chatted. The prices are so reasonable, you could even select a few and have a mini-tasting party during your visit! But, if you&#39;re not in the mood to indulge your sweet tooth, Tous Les Jours has a great cafe, and a fascinating selection of tea accessories encased in french packaging-- infusers, tea bags, tea tins and more. I wish I would&#39;ve had more room in my luggage to take these gorgeous gifts home! 

The decor inside Tous Les Jours is truly unique. The infusion of French-Asian shines so clearly throughout the cafe and bakery, and I loved seeing the combination of language and culture throughout their signage and menu. My review would a perfect 5 stars if not for one thing: the music. In the 2 hours I was there for my meeting, the same 3-minute song played on repeat the entire time.

Love.  Pure Love.  

It all happened so fast...I was a virgin till now.  Never knew love like this before -  I mean - about French Asian bakeries..and needed - wanted to learn more..apparently, I didn&#39;t know what I&#39;ve been missing...

I&#39;ve had Tous Les Jours bookmarked as soon as this French name popped up as a &#34;new&#34; business.  Being a lover of French Patisseries, it was just a matter of time before I stopped in for a taste and that time came after reading an informative review by Daniel S. from NY and he&#39;s not even Asian or French!  (least he doesn&#39;t look like it in his pic...but I could be wrong).  

I dug deeper and read some other great and detailed reviews here.  They highly facilitated what I should expect to taste and find...and made my selection of eight less challenging...
You heard right...8 + a Macaron...
Go big or go home.    

I brought a friend along for the ride and arrived around 5ish on a weeknight. There were only a few customers sitting inside.  It felt like Tous Les Jours had been expecting me and I embraced the warm and inviting vibe...

An Asian woman (who I presumed was a Manager) instantly greeted me with her warm smile and asked if I had been here before...(was it that obvious?).  I was honest and said I was a virgin and she offered to assist me.  She was very sweet.  Only thing was, the more we spoke the more I started using my hands to convey what I didn&#39;t think she understood..there was a slight language barrier, yet - we both knew we were on the same page and I browsed while she offered a helping hand every now &amp; then...She mentioned some popular items and I asked her opinion on some of mine...she truly made my experience laxed and enjoyable...

I checked out breads first, then grabbed tongs and a tray to start the party. You help yourself here...Moving from left to right, I noticed some breads departed early, while other&#39;s stayed.  I didn&#39;t want any loaves..
I just couldn&#39;t see devouring it all by myself...so I wondered over to the small, personal ones instead.  They were nicely wrapped &amp; presented along the wall with names displayed...very neat and organized..

More pastry/tart selections in center were showcased in clear display cases, both sweet and savory. Some really interesting Savory&#39;s!  Pizza, Croque-monsieur, Boiled eggs, Cheese, Sausage and Frank was even here (hot dog in pastry).  Many other good-looking options. Donuts, Cakes, Macarons....you can buy loose leaf tea here too..

I took home with me:  
Curry Croquette, Milk bread, Chocolate Croissant, Twisted pastry donut, Cream Cheese pastry, Milk Cream Cornet, Hazelnut Cream Bread, Dongle Cheese pastry AND 1 green tea Macaron.
I know...it&#39;s a mouthful...My friend and I split a fresh strawberry &amp; whipped cream filled croissant and grabbed a seat at a large table while I sucked down a delicious iced green tea latte....boy was that yummy.  She loved her Chai latte.

I wasn&#39;t even hungry, but I couldn&#39;t resist this delicate pastry.  The whipped cream tasted so fresh and light and the strawberries were perfect and firm.  The flaky croissant was all I dreamed it would be.  SO GOOD.  It was not indulgent - in fact I didn&#39;t feel one sin coming on, it was that divine...

It only took 2 bites to finish off the Milk Cream Cornet later that night...the name says it all.
A subtle sweetened milky cream oozing from a tender, flaky shell....Love.
Twisted donut dipped in espresso or cappuccino would be a match made in heaven.
Curry Croquette was sensational &amp; a must get next time.  Milk bread melted in my mouth.
Can&#39;t wait for our next date. I can easily see becoming addicted to everything here and I get the hype..its all TRUE.

Here&#39;s the thing I adore about these pastries - - I feel guilt free eating them, that&#39;s how perfect they are.  There is nothing rich or excessive about them.  They are not wildly sweet in the least.
Flavors taste natural and pure....for a franchise, that is quite impressive.
My whorish encounters cost me $27...I totally think that&#39;s a satisfactory amount for what I received....and I don&#39;t feel the prices are outlandish at all.  Items ranged from $1.75 - $4.50 upward....When you don&#39;t want &#39;full on decadent&#39; this is where you go...

These sin-free creatures will keep for 3-4 days in your fridge...so you can take your time.. 

All I know is - - someone better gift me a birthday cake...and that&#39;s a 40 day advance notice...
March 17th.  Merci beaucoup.."

The bakery is set up with merchandise and boxed items when you walk in on the left. In the center of the place you will find fresh baked goods ranging from Croissants to Hot Dog stuff pastries. Pricing is very good as is the quality of the baked goods. This area is &#34;self-serve&#34;.

Coffee is ordered at the counter. I had an Americano which was hot and rich - very well made. Tables are off to the right.

For a self-serve bakery/restaurant it was much cleaner than expected. In fact, it looked immaculate. The design is well done. They offer free wi-fi and it was pretty comfortable.

The merchandise mentioned earlier is really well packaged - nicely wrapped and are suitable for gifts. 

Cost is very reasonable - for four of us, the total bill was under $20."

We&#39;ve tried many pastries and coffees over the last few weeks, and all of them were tasty. Some more, others less, but good overall. Everything is expensive (I live in the Bay Area, which is notorious for being outrageously expensive, and the prices at Tous Les Jours were more than I pay at top-notch bakeries in SF), so consider this place a splurge. If you come expecting Starbucks prices, you&#39;ll be disappointed.

The customer service - or lack-thereof - is horrific. Don&#39;t expect people who speak English (Exhibit A: there was an unmarked slice of cake, I asked what it was, the lady jumped out from behind the cash register, fumbled around with their signs, and poked a &#34;Chocolate Cake&#34; sign in front of it. There was not a brown spot on it, haha. Definitely not chocolate, but... thanks?) and don&#39;t expect much friendliness. Come for delicious sweet things.

Fortunately, Tous Les Jours has started opening bakeries near Chicago which serve the light, well-crafted, delicious pastries you&#39;ve loved.

For those who have never had this type of baked good -- think of the Asian flavors of local favorites such as Chiu Quon or Bini&#39;s Bakery and then infuse the delicious creams and buttery dough you&#39;d find in a patisserie. This produces the perfect combination of flavors and textures that&#39;s really hard to describe unless you try it. Sweet and aromatic... crispy and soft... Admittedly, a bit pricey but you&#39;ll definitely notice the quality with each bite. Here are some of my thoughts on a few items:

Chocolate Cornet - Nice crispy pastry that&#39;s not too sweet with a very delicious creamy chocolate custard on the inside and chocolate bits on the ends.

Strawberry Cream Soboro - I&#39;m a strawberry shortcake lover and I have to say this is an improvement on the formula. The strawberries were bursting with flavor, the cream is very puffy with a great taste of fresh milk, and the pastry is just the right texture almost like a slightly crispy donut.

Pastry donut - Perfect layers of crispy dough, like a buttery puff pastry but with the addictive taste of fried youtaio.

Curry croquette - Perfectly crispy hashbrown like texture on the outside with a very delicious curry and potato flavor on the inside. Mildly mix of spices and not spicy for those who&#39;ve never had this type of item before.

Custard bun - Maybe the nicest bun bread I&#39;ve seen outside of Chiu Quon or St Anna for Asian bakeries. The custard is superb - light, fluffy, great egg taste, almost like cream and not too sweet.

Cream cheese pastry - If you like cheese danishes, you&#39;ll definitely love this. Like the custards, the cream cheese is excellently flavored with a great texture held together by the slightly sweet and puffy dough. The addition of some black sesame seeds and almond slices help bring some additional texture and heartiness to the pastry.

Overall, very highly recommended. Don&#39;t be worried about the prices as you&#39;re definitely getting what you pay for."

But in Chinatown, all those cute pastries are about $1.50 each. It&#39;s definitely a lot more here. So I&#39;m not likely to buy a whole bunch for my family on a regular basis like I usually do.

BUT even though it&#39;s more expensive than I&#39;d like any of it to be, I&#39;m still coming back. The breads are all made with milk instead of water, or so I&#39;m told over and over again by the replaying video in the cafe. It makes for are unique, sweet taste to everything. The cheese filled pastries are great and I tried their curry rice balls (giggle). I loved that as well. I&#39;ll try more of their savory dishes next time."

Tous Les Jours is a very popular South Korean bakery chain that has recently expanded throughout Asia and the US. 

Take French bakery techniques to make classics like baguettes, croissants, donuts, breads, and pastries and then combine them with Asian flavors like mochi, green tea, and red bean and you&#39;ll have Tous Les Jours. The combination makes a delicious fusion of flavors and textures. One taste and you&#39;ll notice a difference from the usual baked goods that you get from the grocery store despite being a little more expensive. They also have cakes, desserts, and a café for coffee and lattes. Check out the curry croquette (deep fried potato bread filled with Asian curry), the cheese bread (soft pillowy dough with a light cream cheese filling, and the milk bread (soft dough with a sweet milk cream filling). Get a variety of items because there are a lot of delectable goodies.  

The Korean writing on the side of the packaging translates to consume the same day for best quality and to refrigerate at 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit). Thanks to the wifey for translating for us non-Koreans. Try to get here earlier in the day because they sell out of the good stuff and specialty items by the evening."

I literally can&#39;t even recommend what to get because all the pastries really are amazing. I did get a multigrain latte and would recommend you not getting that because it turned out very clumpy. Have to try their shaved ice next time!

And found just the kind of things she loves--well made bakery items that aren&#39;t overly sweet or overly made-up. These kind of French/Asian bakeries do it right. 

It&#39;s all pretty much self-serve--just grab a tray and fill it up with the goods.  Except for the full cakes and French macarons--those you just ask for assistance at that counter.  All of the items available look so good--pastry--with fruits or chocolate, breads, buns. So much to choose from.  

We bought an array of items--green tea buns, red bean buns, Milk bread and macarons. 

I am not a green tea fan so I really didn&#39;t care for the green tea pastry.  But the others were really good. The Milk Bread--that was the best.  The softest softest bread with a mild sweet creamy center. It was like a cream filled cloud. The macarons were good too, but the lemon and grapefruit had this weird aftertaste. The raspberry macaron was the best of the three I tried. 

The drink menu looked really good and there are many tables to enjoy eating in."

My chocolate chip twist croissant was bursting with sweetness and had the perfect glazed flakiness to it. It paired perfectly with my iced americano. Do yourself a favor and peruse all of the beautiful cases to determine which sweet is right for you - they have everything from croissants to red bean buns to fruit tarts. I&#39;m pretty sure you can&#39;t go wrong.

A pretty relaxed place where people can come in and enjoy some conversation over coffee and delicious bites.  This place can accommodate your needs. 

Decor 
This place is extremely clean and modern looking with a excellent location.  It&#39;s definitely quiet enough not to be inundated with loud traffic but it can get loud at times depending on how many are there.  There were quite a few people there which jazzed the place up a little bit.  But everything is extremely well organized and beautiful looking.  All the pasties are laid out well and it&#39;s a self serve place.  You pick what you want and place it in a wooden tray and order your drink at the counter and it&#39;s all done.  

Service
It&#39;s self service so there is no wait time at all.  When I got to the counter there was no wait.   I was greeted and paid for my coffee and that was it. Very quick and kind service. 

Food/Product
There is a huge selection for everyone.  There are sweet and savory pastries you can choose from. This place is not a restaurant so you&#39;re not going to get an entree.  This is a sit down place where you choose something to eat and drink as you talk casually.  Bite size portions basically. 

I got the chocolate powdered muffin.  It was airy and not too sweet. Not cakey at all. I&#39;d recommend it. 

Price 
Price was excellent.  I got a chocolate muffin with a small coffee for $5.50 with tax. Can&#39;t beat the price. 

Overall experience/Conclusion
Overall I&#39;d recommend place if you wanna come and hang out with friends and get a bite to eat. Again, it&#39;s not an entree place just a place where you can get a little something to nibble on.  Since it&#39;s not pricey at all you can get multiple things and notv break the bank. 

Bon apetite! :-)"

Everything I tried here is so good! They have a variety of teas, smoothies, bubble tea, and coffee. They have some goods that are pre-wrapped, and others that you pick out with tongs that are in a case. I don&#39;t think you can go wrong. They have sweet, they have savory. I love their bread, it is the SOFTEST bread, and just the right amount of sweet. It&#39;s addicting. I like anything that is cream/custard filled.

They also have a variety of pastries, beverages (coffee, tea, boba), and macarons which I didn&#39;t get a chance to try. What I had the pleasure of trying is their tiramisu which was phenomenal.. Wonderful texture, light, and creamy with just the right hint of espresso.

My boyfriend and I have a little tradition of going out for breakfast after he wraps up his week working third shift.  He gets off of work, I wake up, we spend an hour together eating something delicious while laughing about our week and hold hands. 

This week he was in the mood for something a little different, and he found this place on YELP.  It&#39;s tucked away in a shopping mall by petco and H-Mart, and a little hard to find.  I&#39;m a big fan of Bini Bakery and Hippo Bakery, so I was excited to try this place.  

At 7:30 am, the doors were still locked (they open at 7), but a friendly woman let us in.  I&#39;d say 75% of their stock was out, and it was a glorious sight.  I had a Crouqette and a pumpkin donut, and my boyfriend had two chocolate chip pastries of various textures.  

They were freaking AMAZING. The textures and flavors were amazing!

We also got a milk tea latte and a vanilla latte, and we got little designs in the foam.  They were quite good as well. 

My boyfriend and I loved what we got so much, that we got some to go.  I got a milk bread, and he got a mocha loaf, cheese balls, some day old twists, and a red bean pastry.  

I&#39;ll probably go after work today to see what they have.  This place is stellar.

The only problem I had with this place is when I went at around almost 9pm to grab some bread for coworkers. Some of the breads were rock hard and they were still trying to sell them. The lady apologized but did not remove them. So, it is best to come here here during the day I guess."

The cup was honestly perfect for my boyfriend and I since they give you a lot. I suggest if there are two of you to just order one but if there are more of you I suggest the bowl. Although, you can also just order a couple cups to try other flavors. The cups are about $7-8 and the bowls are about $11.

Went here with my spouse.  We observed lots of bakery, buns, breads, and sweets.
Most bakery products were sold separately/or singled.  I really didn&#39;t have alot of time to look around and taste everything.  But once I stepped into the store, i was most interested in their cake rolls.  The one we chose was a matcha cake roll.  It was boxed up, very pretty and cute.
The price was at $16 bucks.  Portion wise, was not very big, but I would say serve about 4-6.

Inside, had some seating.  There were customers just sitting around, lounging and enjoying their bakery.  Since the place was a bit tiny, it did feel overcrowded.  Also since it was still quite new, it was quite busy.

Overall, the employees were very nice and friendly.  We got our cake roll and was out of the store quickly.

I will probably go back to this bakery again, and try more stuff.  They have plenty of sweet and salty bakery products."

Upon entering--first impression is &#34;this is a happy place&#34; Warm bakery aromas and French bakery look. All the baked goods are in plain view in cases so it looks all the more carbolicious. It is self service so you take a cute little tray and pick what you want then pay at the counter. Make sure to have coffee! My husband had anything with a sausage embedded in it---pretty good mildly sweet bread with a thin sausage (good quality hot dog?) I had my fav everywhere a chocolate croissant and we also tried the curry bun and the cheese bun. Everything was rich and delish. Don&#39;t look for calorie counts here! We took home a I think it was called a whipped cream bread. Over the week ...maybe less---I ate the whole thing- all of it-didnt even share. And because of that airy pillowy so soft you could replace a tempurpedic with it bread---I was furiously working out thinking &#34; that bread was SO worth all this pain&#34;&#34; Get it. Just Get It!!
Plenty of parking, nice staff is helpful to the different set up, nice place to sit and talk, reasonable prices. Hidden Gem!"

As every other review has said, the goodies are on display like jewels.  Grab a tray and tongs and open the doors to deliciousness--this is self-serve, so getting what you want is speedy.

Unfortunately, getting a beverage isn&#39;t so speedy.  I&#39;ve been here three times--every time there was a considerably delay while the cashier/barista tried to do everything--ring up and make my and every other person&#39;s beverage.  However, when I come here, I&#39;m not looking for speed--I&#39;m looking for a nice experience.  Once I get past my &#34;gotta have it now&#34; moment and just chill, things are better.  This last time, I noticed that when customers backed up reinforcements made an appearance.

Because I&#39;m paying a premium price for these goodies, TLJ needs to upgrade their napkins (too skimpy) as well as the plasticware (too flimsy).  The area outside of the restroom would benefit from some tidying up.

I&#39;ve had good coffee, tasty chai.  Next time I&#39;m going to try one of the bubble teas and a maple bacon donut.  Mmmmmm--bacon......"

They have a dizzying assortment of baked goodies, some of which were rather unique, in both savory and sweet along with other breads and multiple beverage options (bubble tea!) and shaved ice sweet concoctions.  Some of their savory options would be good as a smaller meal, even.  We took home 6 different pastries to sample and all were very good (love me some red bean paste buns!).  I like that the ingredients are listed on the sign for each item and many had the calories listed as well (which I chose to ignore...).  I recommend eating your treats the same day if possible as they are definitely not as fab the next day.  The only reason I didn&#39;t give them 5 stars is because they seem to only use margarine rather than butter as far as I could tell from the signage for each item and butter is far superior for taste &amp; texture.  They are also priced slightly higher than the Asian bakery in Mitsuwa (Happy Hippo) but clearly the rent at this place &amp; the decor costs more than the bakery at the back of Mitsuwa."

I am so happy that this Korean bakery has finally arrived to Schaumburg! Before the only options were Hippo Japanese bakery in Arlington Heights (which is still amazing) or to truck on over to Bakersville. This place has it all. I especially love the hot dog breads, and they have 3 kinds!!!!  They also had most of the baked goods cut up and available to sample too (drool....samples....), which is great if you want to try before you buy. I love that this is a few doors down from H Mart so you can buy some groceries, go here to get some pastries to go, or have a coffee or drink and some yummy treats to stay and enjoy a nice chat with a friend. Some other favorites are the iced ginger drink (ask for less ice for your drinks) and the mini version of pastries with fruit on top. Another tip is that the boba drinks is not tapioca bubbles but the popping lychee or mango bubbles, but they let you know. We will be back and with updates for cake and other things but for now as a first impression, I was very happy with my experience."

It is located at an inside corner of a strip mall.
Upon entering and checking the layout, this place brought back some memories of similar bakeries. I spent quite a bit of time in S.E Asia and Singapore in particular and this style of bakery is quite common there, Same setup, same type of items. You grab a tray and a pair of tongs and start checking out the cases and pick out the items that appeal to you.
Well, a lot of the items appealed to me but you can only eat so much and you have to be reasonable in your selection. I had a strawberry w/cream croissant , a cornette with cream, and a few other items that I don&#39;t remember the names but I liked how they looked.
All items chosen were of high quality and delicious. I know that this is a Korean chain but there is definitely a French influence in many bakery items.

I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t live near here because if I did, I would be here too many times and would probably end up weighing 500 pounds. However, if I&#39;m around, I will stop in to treat myself.

About 4.5 on a rating but I knocked it down 1/2 because of how they packaged my items to go. In little individual bags. I like boxes to keep the integrity of the items looks.

Cheers to all"

I have always thought &#34;bakery&#34; food was garbage.  They all have the same stuff, it&#39;s always stale, and even if it&#39;s fresh - it always tastes so generic and underwhelming.  

This place is a refreshing change to say the least.  First off, the decor and ambiance of the place is perfect.  The selection of goods is such a joy to browse, and choose from.  Everything I have had so far has been world class.  A huge step up in quality over anywhere else (Deerfields, etc) in the area.  I have introduced this shop to a few of my coworkers/friends and they are all as blown away as I am.

Please visit this store and enjoy.  You will be so glad you did.  I really hope this place continues to provide the quality level they are at right now beyond the &#34;honeymoon&#34; phase of them opening, because it&#39;s such a treat."

I also want to emphasize the &#39;freshness&#39; they claim to have in their products. I must say this is very very true. The pastries are so fluffy, a perfect amount of sweet, with a perfect amount of buttery texture. 

I had the milk tea with tapioca pearls. This was good as well but not as out of this world as I&#39;ve tried in other places. The pearls aren&#39;t different from any other standard boba tea place. You&#39;ll find places like Kung Fu Tea with honey soaked into the tapioca pearls but I didn&#39;t taste anything different with these.

Lots of variety of savory and sweet pastries and breads.  I was particularly impressed with the croissant (I tried the one half-dipped in chocolate) - butter and airy at the same time.  Also tried the strawberry soboro (very tasty and rich) and the almond brick toast - never tried this delicious sweet concoction before (almond and cream).

Prices are quite reasonable for baked goods but the higher priced drinks can bring your tab up.  I tried the Capuccino and Caramel Macchiato - both were good but not quite as good as Coffee Haus.  Disappointed that the bubble teas were not made with fresh fruit -  made with powders or syrups and I think banana may be the only fresh fruit they can add.

Still my favorite for Tonkotsu  &#34;salt&#34; ramen hands down!  The pork broth is excellent, creamy and so rich, this is what makes this bowl of ramen the best around even with all the &#34;newer&#34; ramen houses in the burbs and city.  Santouka has forever spoiled me when it comes to their Tonkotsu broth! A close second would be the Ramen House Shinchan. The pork cheek that comes with Santouka&#39;s ramen is so tender and melts in your mouth, love all the toppings especially the mushrooms, green onions and a piece of naruto/fish cake.  The noodles are firm, chewy, plentiful and so good!

They always have combos but make sure you have a big appetite because just one medium bowl of ramen is very filling!  They have other varieties of ramen like the miso which is also very good but I think Misoya has a slight edge on the miso department; that is why I mainly stick with the Tonkotsu here, can&#39;t go wrong with that choice!

The downside is that it&#39;s cash only and the lines are long during the weekends but it&#39;s so worth it!"

Ramen is good and filling. I have had my tour of ramen restaurants and this is a good stop. Glad to find it in my home city. 

For those with different broth preferences they have 4 to choose from. Salt, soy sauce, miso and spicy miso are the four. The small and medium and large are $1 difference in each size. The combo choices are are good, and they have appetizers to ad if you wish. I had their 82 and was happy. 

The eating are is fitting for the restaurants in the food court and they have high chairs, yeah!  Overall great experience with service, food and environment."

The line was pretty long when we arrived. We probably waited about 15 minutes to order which wasn&#39;t too bad because their service is pretty organized. We were given a number which was to be called when our order was ready for pick-up. There was also a sign at the cashier that mentioned a wait time of 15-20 min to receive your order. We ordered the Medium Spicy Miso Ramen Combo that came with Chashu bowl and egg.

The Chashu bowl was delicious, very well seasoned, and complete with small Chashu pieces that melt in your mouth. The egg was quite disappointing however. We though it would be the Japanese ajitama egg, but it was a normal hard boiled tea egg. On to the ramen, the broth was flavorful, nicely seasoned, and had a nice spicy kick that was not too overwhelming. The ramen noodles were also perfectly cooked, still chewy and just the right consistency. However, the Chashu in the ramen was different than the one in the Chashu bowl, and was not the same fatty/melt in your mouth goodness. 

Overall, the food was good, but not good enough as others reviewers have said or at the 5 star level. Next time we&#39;re in the area, we&#39;ll probably give one of their other ramen a try since they looked yummy as well."

I came here because I had jury duty in Rolling Meadows. No offense to suburbanites but there&#39;s not a lot of great food options but I &#34;yelped&#34; and found about this place.

I was thinking it would be a Japanese version of H-Mart but this place is a lot smaller and a little dingy. I would definitely come back if I was in the area but it&#39;s not worth driving from the city for."

I went with my usual, the Toroniku Spicy Miso Ramen large sized of course (#39)! The pork cheek meat was just as tender as I remembered it &amp; the broth just as spicy and flavorful. The ramen noodles could always be better quality wise, but overall still my favorite bowl of ramen! Also cool to see prices are the same from CA to Chicago. $12.49 for a large bowl with upgraded meat?! I&#39;ll take it any day of the week!

The line can definitely get long. We lucked out by 5 minutes because literally as soon as I put in my order, the line grew by 4 or 5 times the size. Either everyone finished shopping at Mitsuwa at the same time or the weekend lunch crowd just made it through. Worth the trek out if you&#39;re looking for legit ramen and tired of paying $15 or more in downtown Chicago.

Confused about which stand this one is once you walk into Mitsuwa&#39;s food court? Oh easy! It&#39;s the one with the longest line!

I got a #69: Miso ramen with a B meal combo: salmon roe with grilled salmon over rice. I PROBABLY did not need the largest bowl of Ramen but you betcha I finished this! One must not waste Ramen!!! Oh yeah and this was all for $12 and change.

I ended up getting the medium spicy miso... which seems like their popular ramen. I was so happy to get it because it was really delicious :). There was a lot of noodles and a typical amount of meat in it. I think it was $9 for the medium size, which is not bad at all!

I mean, it&#39;s solid ramen for sure - definitely good - but it&#39;s not &#34;great&#34;.

We lucked out on our visit and there were maybe 4-5 people ahead of us in line so we didn&#39;t have to wait long. Soon after, the line stretched far back and people were waiting 15-20 minutes to place an order. The menu looks extensive but it&#39;s really just 4 types of ramen in 3 size options. You decide what style you want (salt, soy, miso, spicy miso), what size (small, medium, large), what &#34;stuff&#34; you want (plain, extra pork, pork cheek, etc) and add sides like eggs. I went with #34 which is a medium spicy miso with cha-siu pork. The medium is plenty big (the large is enormous!) and filed with a generous potion of well cooked noodles, a bit of seaweed and some green onion. Mine was supposed to have fish cake but didn&#39;t. 

Anyway, the &#34;spicy&#34; really wasn&#39;t terribly spicy but it was good. I&#39;d say the broth is lacking overall - it&#39;s not too salty but it&#39;s missing that creamy, porky texture that comes from long simmering. The cha-Siu pork was good - pretty fatty but that&#39;s to be expected. I was super bummed that the eggs served are hard boiled - mine was pretty rubbery/chalky. The mister had a combo which gave him a medium bowl (extra $1), a bowl of rice topped with minced pork and an egg. It&#39;s a good deal and the rice/pork bowl ended up being our favorite thing. Prices are reasonable for sure!

Overall, it&#39;s good enough fast food ramen. Next time, I&#39;d probably get something from the tempura place or the sushi stand instead."

It is also a bit pricey for the size of food, but you will be happy and satisfied afterward. I get the tonkotsu salt ramen small and it fills me up.

The broth today was slightly on the saltier side, but the &#34;Pork Cheeks&#34; (highly recommended) just melts in your mouth!

All their combinations they have are also very good!  It gives you an option to not only have ramen, but to also try their rice bowls such as, their salmon &amp; salmon roe rice bowl.

The ramen comes with choices of broth, meats, different sizes and combinations.

When getting a combo... make sure to get a small bowl of ramen, since the portions are so large!

Their broth is incredibly thick and creamy with delicate garlic and onion notes. I always get spicy miso so that i can also get some nuttiness and heat.

The noodles are nice and bouncy and take in the broth very well. Their menma bamboo shoots are so tender. Their chashu pork is probably the best ive ever had; it&#39;s incredibly soft and tender with pork flavor thats not overly gamy and a tad sweet. It really melts in your mouth! I always get extra.

They also do combos with yummy rice bowls with toppings like salmon roe or green onion and pork, but I stick to my large spicy miso ramen with extra pork; no combo necessary.

It&#39;s located in the food court section of Mitsuwa Market. Seating is standard food court style: first come first serve. They&#39;ll give you a number when you place your order, then call your order number on a microphone when your food is ready. Some of the options are available on display for you to see, in plastic food form behind glass, so you know what you&#39;re getting. 
I love ramen, so I was really excited to eat here. I ordered a grape soda (somewhere in the $2) range. But more importantly, I ordered the #7 which is a medium sized order of Toroniku Ramen. This is a salt broth pork cheek, green onions, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, sour plum, and naruto (fish cake). The food was done insanely fast, within four or five minutes, which was pretty impressive. 

It was amazing. The broth was salty and really full of pork flavor. The noodles were cooked, and there was a lot of them. I definitely didn&#39;t finish them. The highlight was, of course, the pork cheek, which might in fact be my new favorite thing. It was so tender it fell out of my chopsticks, and it just melted in my mouth. I wish I had ordered more meat, it was so good. 

The plum was unexpected, only because I didn&#39;t remember what it was. It&#39;s almost like a pickle, super acidic with a pit in the middle. I kept the onions off my soup (nothing personal, just don&#39;t like onions), and the fish cake is always my last bite. I left full, and sad that I couldn&#39;t fit anymore in. 

This place is cash only. They also had a sign up that they no longer do to-go orders, so if you don&#39;t finish your ramen in one sitting, you&#39;re S.O.L; you can&#39;t take it with you.

The long version:

The restaurant is in the food hall of the Mitsuwa market and can&#39;t be missed if you make a trip here. The ordering process is very straight forward though there menu is a bit confusing for new comers. The ramen comes in combo plates with a bowl of noodles, flavored eggs, and a rice dish. Or you can just get the ramen a la carte. It also comes in 3 different sizes which is great if you&#39;re not super hungry. 

The best value is a large bowl combo but it&#39;s a ton of food so come hungry. I went with a simple bowl of miso ramen. They accept cash only and after payment you receive a number. They call out the number on the loud speaker and you grab your food. 

The broth was amazing, it was very savory but not too heavy. They have very authentic Japanese veggies in the ramen which is a great touch. The noodles were good but not the best I&#39;ve had. Overall you&#39;re going to like this place for the broth. The Tonkatsu was a popular option and looked very rich. 

The value of the food is outstanding. I would have easily paid 3x for the quality of food but maybe not in a food hall. Unsurprisingly there was a huge line and as I enjoyed my meal it gotten even longer. By the time I left it was wrapping around the food hall. Basically come early. Definitely check this place out!"

But even in Japan, there are only a few restaurants, with less than 10.  In the U.S. we are lucky to have a few peppered across the country, with only one in Chicago, located inside Mitsuwa&#39;s grocery store. Amazing.  A great fast food restaurant that delivers high quality food.  This is soul food for me.  

I was blown away with the spicy ramen combo D ($12) that came with a small bowl of ramen and another small bowl of rice with pork chasu and a soy sauce egg.  The noodles for the ramen were what I crave when I want noodles.  They were chewy and oh so sexy.  The pork rice, however for me was just as good.  I expected the pork to be dry but it was so tender with just enough sauce drizzled over the rice.  If you haven&#39;t been here yet and are a ramen fan, come by and give it a whirl.  Cash only!"

I always get a #16 - a large shoyu ramen with chashu pork. Today however I got the combo with a rice and pork bowl on the side with an egg. It&#39;s a better value for the money. It&#39;s SO much food I have to bring a container with me to take half home. 

My husband prefers the miso ramen or the spicy miso. Although he says adding the spice yourself tastes better. (I agree) I personally think the miso ramen is horrible LOL to each their own. Their eggs are perfectly cook and the pork is so moist and tender. We also had their onion bowl and it was good, although I think there needs to be more onion and less bonito flakes. 

We drive about 35 miles just to come here and eat ramen. It&#39;s become out weekend ritual to drive to Mitsuwa to get ramen and a melon pan (from pastry house hippo). 

Be aware it&#39;s cash only and no take out. This is the busiest restaurant in the food court so if it&#39;s really busy expect to wait in line awhile and wait for your food. There was about 40 people in front of us today and it took a solid 15-20 minutes to get the food. Which in my opinion isn&#39;t that long since a normal restaurant would take that long. Also I highly recommend bringing a friend since finding a table is crazy during peak hours and if you leave your table to get your food... you won&#39;t have a table when you return."

I&#39;m kind of a spicy wimp (I can handle a spicy tuna roll), but I did like their spicy miso better than any of their other ones.

My favorite is the Shio ramen (salt). I believe its the most pure version of the broth without the miso or soy to alter the taste. The broth is full bodied and quite flavorful. Definitely not salty like Misoya. You simply taste the richness derived from the many hours of bone simmering. The pork is tender with just the right complement of fatty layer. The bamboo is standard. The largest of the 3 bowl sizes has a very generous amount of noodle. The ramen itself is thin and has a nice bounce. Great texture.

Their Ramen is rich. Noodles are cooked perfectly. Side dishes are tasty. You can choose 3 different sizes, but I always take &#34;L&#34; for Love :). I wish they put a little bit more meat into each dish, but it&#39;s just me.

Very tasty broth, noodles perfectly cooked.  Pork char siu delicious, miso eggs are hard boiled but still tasty. The rice bowl with salmon and roe was delicious, as was the bowl with pork on top.  

Drawbacks:  limited seating in the food court, cash only, and a 40-45 min wait when we went on a Saturday afternoon."

The noodles and broth were decent - flavorful and hearty as you&#39;d expect from ramen. My only issue was the egg though: instead of being nice and gooey, it turned out to be hard-boiled."

I noted that the only meat they served is pork, but I like pork, so I figured, why not? Figuring that I couldn&#39;t go wrong with good quality soy sauce, I got the Soy Sauce bowl with a side of salmon and salmon roe.

Santouka absolutely knocked this out of the park. For a shade over $13 I got a lot of food; what I ordered with a side of duck egg. I think. More importantly, the flavors were terrific.

The soy-pork combination was something special, producing an intense broth that was only magnified by perfectly roasted pork. It&#39;s not your garden-variety pork chop meat here! The noodles held up to the heat of the broth and provided some more subtle flavor. This is the right choice if you have to get just one dish.

Fortunately, for about $5 extra I got the side of white rice, salmon, and salmon roe. The roe was ocean-fresh and soft, while the salmon was well-cooked but remained pink and tender. It&#39;s the perfect accompaniment, served with a bowl of steamed white rice.

It&#39;s cash only, so you&#39;ll probably have to make a run to the ATM in order to eat here. Don&#39;t worry; it&#39;s completely worth your time."
hokkaido-ramen-santouka-arlington-heights,Rosa J.,3OvTOWbD3_gUZ4T6Srd62Q,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,294,140,aW9d9Ssr9VNtZWXVvVqrBw,4.0,2015-05-04,"Ramen is always my kind of comfort food, and I believe it&#39;s the same for many other ramen lovers out there in the world.  

Oh, speaking of the &#34;world,&#34; I just don&#39;t understand why many Yelpers like to use such statement.  Please see below for some examples:

&#34;Wow, that was the best (fill in the blank) I&#39;ve ever had!!&#34;  
&#34;That ramen was the best in the world!!&#34;  

I&#39;m not a nerd...well, I guess I am sometimes since I went to school with a bunch of them.  My point was that he/she can&#39;t use &#34;the best&#34; when he/she hasn&#39;t scientifically validated and approved whatever he/she has consumed was the best indeed.  In other words, it&#39;s important to back up a hypothesis that was made.  Otherwise, your Yelp review wouldn&#39;t be too helpful for me understand what he/she felt after slurping the spicy miso broth.  Understood, my friend?  

Ok, what I had at Santouka during my lunchtime was legit, like what typical Japanese-style ramen tastes like.  There were many Japanese shopping at Mitsuwa and choosing Santouka as their lunch destination as well.  Hey, I know Japanese take a huge pride with everything they do that they&#39;re proud of.  Hence, patronizing Santouka shows that we endorse the ramen here, doesn&#39;t it?  

People, bring your cash or stop by an ATM by the bookstore at the main entrance.  The menu is formulated in a &#34;grid.&#34;  In summary, there are four (4) types of ramen broth: salt, soy sauce, miso, and spicy miso.  Once you&#39;ve decided what you want for the broth, then select the ingredients.  There are three (3) choices: regular, cha shu (pork), or toroniku.  The &#34;toroniku&#34; option has the toppings separated from the ramen.  

You also can ask for the combo, with a total of three (3) choices.  The &#34;plastic models&#34; inside the case beneath the menu will be your trusty guide to make the most appropriate selection for your appetite.  

All options are numbered.  If you don&#39;t know what you want by the time you approach to the cashier, pick a number between 1 to 150.  Then there will be some kind of ramen or combo on your table in about ten (10) to fifteen (15)-minute wait.  

We had #21 (large soy sauce ramen) and #65 (soy sauce ramen combo, with an egg and salmon/salmon roe rice).  The taste of authenticity was really on point.  Ingredients in a bowl of Japanese street-style ramen are as simple as they can be (noodle, meat, scallions, seaweeds, bamboo shoots, and sesame seeds).  The pork was tender but a bit fatty.  Nevertheless, I thought the broth was nice; the noodle was done al dante.  The total cost of our lunch was $23.  It&#39;s slightly cheaper than some Japanese establishments that serve ramen in the city.  A bowl of ramen in the city usually costs $12 to $18 (yeah, Willis-Tower high)!  

P.S. There&#39;s no longer a &#34;to-go&#34; option.  I&#39;ve heard that the line is like a giant snake on the weekend, so come during the off-peak times, or in the beginning of their business hours (11am).  

I&#39;m not a suburb-dweller, and my food activities are typically involved within the city limit.  I certainly will be back when opportunities come to my way."

Unlike the other restaurants where the pork is mostly fat, the pork at Santouka is legit and tender. The broth is flavorful and not too salty. I would highly recommend getting the large bowl. One of my friends got a small bowl and I was like &#34;are you kidding me, I can finish that in 3 bites. The large bowl is twice the side of a small and it was only 2 extra dollars. 

I would have given this place a 5 stars, however, I did not like the customer service. The cashier was rude for no apparently reason. My friend walked up to the register and said &#34;hi&#34; and the cashier gave her a hand signal to stop talking because he was busy typing. I was about to walk away, but I did not because I was craving ramen. oh yea, cash only."

Both my friend and I we&#39;re not really that amazed with the taste. It&#39;s just like a regular ramen. What I liked is that they have different sizes so at least you don&#39;t have to force yourself to finish it if you&#39;re already full.

I just recently moved to the Chicago suburbs and having a Santouka near me is such a blessing. Will be here more often and especially during the cold winter months."

Could this be? A highly rated place on a top 10 food list without having to drive all the way to the city? Finally the burbs had a hidden gem of their own. I&#39;ve consistently seen Santouka and Ramen Misoya near the top of every ramen rankings list, and I can&#39;t believe I waited so long to try either of them.

This place is located in the food court of Mitsuwa Marketplace, a Japanese grocery store. I read about the long lines on the weekends, so I decided to check it out on a weekday. There wasn&#39;t much of a line, but I still had to wait about 10 minutes until my order was ready. 

The menu is basically a grid of different broth/topping combinations. I ordered #39, the Toroniku (pork cheek) spicy miso ramen. I went ahead and threw in a soy flavored egg because ramen&#39;s never complete without an egg. The Toroniku style comes as a bowl of plain noodles and broth with a separate plate of the meat and garnishes. I don&#39;t know if I just got a fresh batch, but temperature wise, this was definitely the hottest ramen I&#39;ve ever had. It came out piping hot. My eagerness almost ruined my meal as I almost burned my tongue with that first slurp.

Noodles:
The noodles were thin, yellow, and chewy. While I didn&#39;t think the noodles alone were anything special, it worked very well with the broth as a whole. Also, they gave a decent amount of noodles, more than in most bowls of ramen I&#39;ve had.

Broth:
The broth at Santouka wasn&#39;t as deep and heavy as the ones at some of my favorite ramen spots, but it definitely had a great flavor. Also, the spicy miso wasn&#39;t actually that spicy. It had the slightest hint of heat and had a good amount of saltiness. It was also steamin hot...perfect for a cold winter day. 

Toppings:
I&#39;m used to having charred or grilled pork belly in my ramen, so the pork cheek was definitely a different spin. The meat itself was ultra tender and fatty. It was so soft you barely needed to chew it. The flavor of the pork cheek was actually on the sweeter side and I thought it tasted very similar to ham. I also added a flavored egg. As others said, the egg was basically fully boiled and I would&#39;ve definitely preferred it to have a runnier yolk.

Overall, I really enjoyed the ramen. This can easily become a dangerous habit for me, as it&#39;s close by in the burbs and more of a fast food style than a sit down restaurant, making it way too convenient to satisfy my ramen fix."

Over the many years we have stopped here to eat she usually goes straight to Santouka for the C-Setto. Only recently has she tried something different (B-Setto or ?? I think) and once even ordered at a different restaurant there. Since she is from Japan she knows what will really taste like home. Another clue is that Santouka consistently has the longest line.

The udon place next door is also yummy, but my favorite was this ramen place called Hokkaido. It was recommend to me by Japanese people, who are so polite and friendly. Being here for a week I feel like I&#39;ve stepped into JP for the love of food. Anyway this ramen texture was just right, soup was miso and soooooo delicious could swear it&#39;s pork bone. The bonus is that you can order a set and get a rice with it oh yummmy salmon roe my favs... There&#39;s nothing I can mark down - great service, delicious food. Traveling to Chicago just got better.

Salt is my FAVORITE. don&#39;t be thrown off by the name, which doesn&#39;t sound appetizing, it&#39;s just a name. I actually ordered it with a little less salt, for fear of having the horrible experience I had at Misoya, which was SALT SALT AND MORE SALT. 
My family agreed that the salt one tasted the best!

I used to go to Mitsuwa more often but now that I live far, I go when I can. This week I&#39;ve been ridiculously craving ramen! What better place could I think of than Santouka? Hands down the best restaurant in Mitsuwa. As a heads up, this place is CASH ONLY! There&#39;s a fifth-third bank ATM located near the entrance of Mitsuwa. 

I&#39;ve been to many ramen places, but Santouka is my go-to place. I can always rely on them for making some quality ramen for an affordable price. Most places don&#39;t even give you combo options. For less than $10 you can have a medium combo meal with ramen, meat over rice, and egg - whereas other places may charge you $13 just for the bowl of ramen! The medium combo meal is more than enough to fill you up; I can&#39;t even finish it!

I usually get the salt ramen because it&#39;s the perfect broth. It&#39;s very flavorful and simple; I feel like you can have miso ramen or soy sauce ramen anywhere, but Santouka really does salt ramen right. They&#39;ve got at least two pieces of pork, more than a couple bamboo shoots, a naruto, mushrooms, and so on. I highly recommend the combo D because the pork over rice is unbeatable. If I could get a couple of these, I would. It isn&#39;t salty and neither meals are too heavy. I usually put one slice of the egg in the ramen and the other in the rice bowl. 

They&#39;ve got water next to the restaurant so you can serve yourself. They also have very good English speakers working so you don&#39;t have that language barrier when ordering. When you&#39;re seated, they announce your number through a microphone so you can&#39;t miss it! The wait for the food isn&#39;t long either! On busy days like weekends, expect to see a line but I&#39;ve never ever had to wait too long."

I never liked the instant ramen. I never ate it in college. Now I know why. My heart just wanted the real deal. Santouka has it! They are inside the Mitsuwa Marketplace food court. The food court gets a little packed during lunch time, but we were still able to find a seat. They have pictures/displays of the different ramen and sides that they offer. Everything is so cheap (and cash only). I ordered the miso ramen. This noodle bowl is packed full of flavor. I don&#39;t know what they put in here, I don&#39;t know that I even want to know. All I know is I took down every last noodle with my chopsticks and slurped up every last drop of that broth. 

They have a variety of other kinds of ramen as well. It&#39;s simple, but well done. The people at the service counter were nice. They were having issues with their microphone to call off the meals that were ready, but they handled it fine. I will definitely be back!"

I&#39;ve had many bowls of ramen in Japan. One glorious bowl of garlic-flavored ramen from a phantom ramen shop in Shinjuku, that mysteriously disappeared the next day.

Compared to the above, this place is good. How can I tell? There are Japanese people working in the back. It&#39;s also a Japanese restaurant nestled in a Japanese grocery store, in a suburb with a well-known Japanese community. Also, the ramen is simple, broth was good, noodles were chewey, and the pork tasted great. Ramen is on ever corner in Japan, and Santouka may be even better than one or two of the places I&#39;ve been to over there. 

Best ramen in Chicago-area could be relative. Are you a simple &#39;good broth, good noodle, good pork? good ramen&#39; person? Then Santouka is your place. 

Are you a toppings person? Lots of shops around Chicago and the USA put their spin on it with toppings and add ons. Go find one you like with the toppings you like.

But I recommend to not judge the best ramen on what&#39;s on top. I don&#39;t think toppings make the best ramen in town. It&#39;s the broth and noodles. There are a bunch of other shops in Chicago that do just that very well too. If you go by that alone, this place is solid."

I have been to the santouka restaurant in Vancouver and in comparison this was fairly close in taste but definitely not as good as the actual restaurant in Vancouver. 

The ramen broth was full of flavour with a good amount of pork, however, the egg was a disappointment. The egg was precooked and cold and served in a little sauce container. But I guess can&#39;t expect the world when the ramen is served fast food style in a food court.

Santouka has many options for ramen bowls based on broth type and ingredients you want in your ramen. 

 My go-to ramen picks are the miso or spicy miso ramen with cha-siu (barbecue pork).  A small bowl typically is enough to fill me up but there are days when you just wanna pig out and that&#39;s when I&#39;ll get a medium or get a combo meal (they have different types of rice bowls and an egg).  The cha-siu ramen comes with bamboo shoots, chopped green onions, cha-siu, and a slice of fish cake.

Santouka is the heavier version (kotteri, or rich) and has a pork based broth (tonkatsu). You have your options of broth, and it really goes by personal preference. I&#39;m a big fan of miso!

Incredibly filling, with just enough chasu-pork, bamboo shoots, scallions, sesame seeds, and seaweed. A rice bowl on the side makes everything perfect, especially if you&#39;re eating with a hungry boyfriend who&#39;s disappointed that you actually finished your bowl.

I wish they had hot tea available - it may be the Asian in me, but I can feel the fat and oils sitting in my stomach after a bowl of ramen!

The ramen was as expected but the broth was just a touch off from what I was used to. As Santouka is a franchise restaurant that is, not only in the US, but also in Canada and Japan. I have only tried Santouka in Vancouver and Toronto so I could only compare this ramen with the one I have tried before. For consistency&#39;s sake, I tried the Shio. 

The Shio here tastes less creamy and smooth with more of a salty flavour than the other two. The noodles were well made and cooked. I took off one star because their noodles did not come with an egg as the other locations did. Also, the egg that was available for purchase was NOT runny.

I really liked the food here.  There were options, but not so many that I was overwhelmed.  The menu provided descriptions that weren&#39;t too vague.  I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen, a salty and spicy broth with noodles, pork, and some veggies.  It came with a small bowl of rice with small pieces of BBQ pork.  For $12, this was a filling lunch that was ideal on a chilly, rainy day like when I visited.  Ramen is offered in three sizes; I had the small, which was more than enough.

There is nothing I can compare with Santouka, and I was very satisfied with my meal here.

What&#39;s nice is that they offer different sized portions so you&#39;re not stuck sucking noodles for a half hour.

You know it&#39;s authentic, because the menu is overcomplicated for customers. What works for the kitchen is a bit daunting when trying to figure out what to order.

It&#39;s actually quite simple. Let me save you the headache. You have four choices in ramen: salt, soy sauce, miso, and spicy miso in three different sizes (i.e., small, medium, large.) You can order a combo that comes with a side. Just look at the menu by the ordering window as a giant multiplication table - needlessly complicated.

This place is how ramen should be priced, and the noodles have a nice bouncy texture to them. The broth is saltier than I would prefer, but this is the way it&#39;s supposed to be. I had the miso ramen (large) with extra pork for ~$11. Yum yum.

Very satisfying meal while I waited for my wife to shop around the grocery store. You won&#39;t see a sign in English for this place, but you&#39;ll know it when you get there. There&#39;s usually a line of people for this place and it&#39;s in the far corner of the food court.

A lover of the anime, Naruto, I crave authentic Japanese ramen every time I watch Naruto slurp up his giant bowl of deliciousness and Santouka gives me that satisfaction. They serve their ramen noodles in various sizes from small, medium, or large bowls which can be completed with different sets (sides) of white rice with green onions, a soy egg, or white rice with natto (femented soy beans) etc. There are also different ramen flavors: shio ramen (salt flavor), miso (soybean paste flavor), shoyu (soy sauce flavor), and tokusen toroniku (choice pork flavor).

To get a full detail of each ramen flavor you can visit their website at: http://www.santouka.co.jp/en/menu/index.html

My all time favorite is the spicy miso ramen with its rich pork broth and hearty miso paste and tender melt-in-your-mouth pork slices, fish cake, and veggies . The noodles are perfectly cooked with just the right chewiness/al dente to them. Although tokusen toroniku is a close second with it&#39;s tender richness. &#34;Toroniku Cha-shu is simmered pork cheek (jowl) meat. Pork cheek meat is very rare and only 200-300g can be taken from each pig. It has a very rich flavour and it is tender like fatty tuna.&#34; *Drools!*

Too bad Santouka isn&#39;t like Naruto where the chef will sometimes give him free ramen, hehe. Nom nom."

I ordered the toroniku (pork cheek) salt ramen while the bf ordered the cha shu salt ramen. They were both good, but the pork cheek was more tender. Out of all the ramen places I have tried, the broth at Santouka is probably my favorite. The portions are very generous. I was greedy and decided to order a large size ramen since it was only an additional $1. I was full half way through my meal and snuck extra noodles and meat into my bf&#39;s bowl when he got up to get water. Afterwards, we were both about to explode because we were so full.  

EDIT: I returned for a second visit and tried the medium size spicy miso toroniku ramen, which was also good. I left feeling satisfied and full, but I barely had any room for green tea soft serve from next door (Releaf).

I wish this place was not so far from where I live. I only know of two ramen places in the burbs and they are both incredibly far from me. Nonetheless, it is worth the 30 minute drive. 

I have come here twice in the past three weeks. I am kind of glad it is this far away otherwise my health will quickly deteriorate because the broth is so salty, but so good. The main downside is the wait during lunch... Many others have touched on this point as well. Came here at 2pm on Saturday and it took a total of 30 minutes from lining up to receiving my order. The line to order and pay took 10ish minutes while prep took 20ish minutes. Luckily, this is cafeteria style and you can wander freely around Mitsuwa and buy random Japanese snacks to hold off your hunger. 

I got the Spicy Miso Ramen, and I highly recommend it. Do not expect a super sweat inducing bowl of noodles though even though the soup is deceivingly  fiery red, but I hardly felt the heat (my heat tolerance is not above average either... I need a glass of milk with my flaming hot Cheetos&#39;s). I also wished they used a real spoon. Something about the cheap plastic throwaway soup spoon disproportionately decreases my experience.

A group of classmates and I decided to explore the local grocery stores during our first weekend in pharmacy school. We all missed yummy Asian food and needed to do some grocery shopping. We did the long 30 minutes drive to Santouka/Mitsuwa and ate before grocery shopping (its better to shop on a full stomach so you don&#39;t buy everything when you&#39;re hungry).

I waited to order 2 #22 (medium sized miso ramen) and the total came out to about $15. They had a sign that warned us that the orders will take about 30-40 minutes to be ready and that was a true warning. Even though the line didn&#39;t seem that long (I had about 3 people in front of me), it took about 30 minutes for our food to be ready. I am not sure why, maybe people order a lot of themselves. But be prepared for that wait. I would advise you to try another vendor if you are super hungry.

Once our number was called, we got our food and devoured the ramen in less than 10 minutes. It has the same consistency as So Cal Santouka ramen. I am so glad to have a piece of home over here in Chicago.

If you never had Santouka ramen, you definitely have to try. Their broth is super flavorful and they do not skimp out on the pork meat they give you. The bowl also comes with bamboo and mushrooms. I am always satisfied after eating a medium sized bowl of miso ramen.

Eat or die trying, yo! Santouka, holy s***, your ramen is the real deal.

We went around 9 PM and found no line. In the back left of Mitsuwa Market, we discovered the oh-so tiny Santouka. With an overwhelming number of options, the cashier suggested that we order his favorite: the Toroniku Salt Ramen. I found out it was cash only, so I walked to the ATM located at the front of the store, withdrew some $$$ and paid the $3 charge. 

I returned, ordered, and waited only about five minutes before receiving our food. Really fast!

The Toroniku Salt Ramen came with one bowl and plate. One bowl held the broth and noodles, and the plate had the scallions, pork belly, and other goodies. From what I was told, Santouka separated these two in order to not overcook the high cuts of pork belly. But whatever! I decided to dump the non-broth bowl into the other, anyways.

Mannn, deep porky flavors (like two levels, yo), al dente noodles, and decadent pork belly made this the best thing I ate in Chicago. My girlfriend and I didn&#39;t speak to each other for a good 10 minutes, as we just slurped our way to the bottom of our respective bowls while uttering &#34;holy s***&#34; and &#34;hellll yeah, hellll yeah.&#34; I had some broth left, and decided to put down the soup spoon, grab my bowl by its waist, and raise that ish up to my lips so I could inhale the rest of my bowl&#39;s contents. Kind of like how I drunkenly kissed this one girl at a salsa club back in the day, but this was more aggressive. There weren&#39;t any people around, so I didn&#39;t care too much.

It is, by far, the most popular of the few mall-style food booths at Mitsuwa.

Not knowing what I was walking into, I went at 11:45 AM on a Saturday without any cash. Bush league.

I would soon find out that Santouka&#39;s busiest times are weekend lunches and that they only accept cash -- no plastic, rookie. The line to order was about 10 minutes plus about 25 minutes waiting nervously for my food.

But the ramen was worth it. Basically, you select between four broths: Salt, Miso, Spicy Miso, or Pork. Then you can add sides to it or slightly customize it to your wishes. I settled on a large Spicy Miso Ramen with a side of pork and rice.

It was delicious. The broth was very good, although not as spicy as I had hoped. The noodles and other ingredients were money. The pork, however, was very fatty. I typically remove excess fat but this pork was prepared so well that it just melted in my mouth which -- believe me -- normally would sound borderline-gross to me too. But Santouka worked it. The large ramen size was also surprisingly substantial.

Santouka&#39;s a great ramen joint in the northwest suburbs. The only drawbacks are the lack of seating and that it&#39;s a little on the pricey side. If you&#39;re willing to wait a while for the food and then wrestle American Gladiator style for the very limited cafeteria seating in the food court, try this place out!"

If spicy isn&#39;t your thing, they have a nice variety of different broth types and different meat quantities/types, plus some combos served with the soy sauce egg and a little side dish.

This is a decent place for ramen. They offer three main types of soup bases: miso, shoyu and spicy. You also get a choice of cha-shu, vegetarian and one more which I don&#39;t remember, together with the soup that you chose. So that makes the menu large and potentially intimidating but it is in fact pretty simple to navigate =) 

There are three sizes small, medium and large. I usually get the set, consisting of a small ramen with a mini donburi (Japanese rice dish). My favorite is the pork ramen with miso soup, with the salmon donburi. 

I think the soup and noodles are authentic. I wish they make the egg better, it&#39;s more of a hard boil egg rather than the Japanese-style eggs where the whites are cooked and the yolk medium-boiled. This was why it&#39;s four-star and not five. 

Santouka is located in the food court of Mitsuwa, and it&#39;s always busy for as long as I remember. I have always been there during non-peak hours, but even that is insufficient to overcome the problem of getting seats. The huge crowd correlates with the long waiting times, but Santouka is good at letting you know how long the wait times will be, so you know what you are getting into before you order. 

Being in a different country it will not be fair to compare this with the ramen found in the country of origin, Japan. But with the limitations of ingredients and such factors involved, all being said, this is a pretty decent place for a good bowl of ramen."

The first location was so packed and the line looked too long so we opt for this location located inside the Mitsuwa market. When we walked in it was packed and there was also a long line but we stuck it out because we checked out yelp and saw all the good ratings for this place.
This is my second time trying authentic ramen soup and my first time was okay. The fresh made noodles comes from the same distributor so it all comes down to the broth and the proteins they offer.
The line wasn&#39;t so bad, we finally reached the counter within minutes. I ordered the #29 large miso broth with pork cheeks and hubby ordered the #9 salty broth with pork checks. We noticed people also got a side order of a seasoned hard boiled egg so we said why not we&#39;ll take one.
 They have a pretty wide selection of their menu so take the time to go over it or trust your fellow Yelpers;)
The price was pretty good for the amount of food you get and also this is cash only. They do not have to go orders here, so make sure you find time to grab a table before you get your meal if you dare to come here for the luncheon rush hours. If you ordered the large you must have a good appetite or Phatties like us! Go big or go home;)
This place is within a food court with lots of other options but focus, we&#39;re here for Ramen soup. You will notice this place has the longest line, so you know the food must  be good! When we got our order it was served separately, Ramen noodles in hot broth in a nice heavy bowl and a plate of sides including slices of pork cheeks. Yes you will have to mix it your self with the Ramen noodles and the hot broth. Slurp, slurp....OMG!!! The broth slurp is so hot, yummy, creamy and flavorful!!!  And the pork checks so tasty and it melts into your mouth! All the ingredients and sides blended very well with the broth!
We each ordered the large bowl which we noticed was a lot of food for us. So next time we will get the medium size bowls.
It lost a star cause it&#39;s cash only and I couldn&#39;t take my leftovers home with me. So I had to force myself to finish my noodles sigh...I&#39;m sleepy now soo full!
Overall, I would definitely come back here for the Ramen noodle soup, medium size. Both of our choices salty and miso style were really good. For me, I&#39;d order the Miso again as I need to watch my salt intake lol."

I had the salted ramen.  This is not one of those, let&#39;s put the kitchen sink in your bowl type places.  This is a food court, and it&#39;s simple good ramen.  The noodles are good, the soup is good, and the pork was excellent.  The black flowery mushrooms and yellow stick looking things? were great.  Just don&#39;t finish the soup to the bottom, there&#39;s some kinda grainy residue on the bottom that is not good, the soup itself is great. I like that even though it&#39;s a food court, you are being served in legit bowls.  A medium is a lot of food. The large is a bit overwhelming.

Be prepared to wait about 5-10 minutes to order then 15 minutes to get your food and prepare to search for a table during busy times.

I had Santouka in Irvine over the summer, so it was nice to double down on the ramen in suburban Chicago.

I found both the Irvine version of Santouka and Mitsuwa (the Japanese supermarket in which Santouka is located) cleaner and nicer. But Mitsuwa sure does feel like an oasis in the far less Asian-fied Chicago.

In my opinion, ramen broth is important but the noodles are the key. Santouka&#39;s noodles are tasty, springy, and eminently slurpable. Yes, slurpiness is of utmost importance. Their broth is on the salty side. We rectified that in Irvine by asking for lower sodium, but didn&#39;t do so in Chicago. There&#39;s a noticable difference.

Broth ordering is based on preference. I&#39;m partial to shoyu, though the miso is very good. I haven&#39;t had the shio. The spicy optionality is a must-try. Great, now I really want some ramen."

Such is the case at Mitsuwa Marketplace in Arlington Heights.   This tiny ramen counter anchors one end of their modest food court.

You&#39;ll see nothing fancy here, just straightforward pictures menus with descriptions that allow you to order by number.  

Ramen is available in four flavors; Shio (salt broth), Miso, Shoyu (soy sauce broth) and Tokusen Toroniku (choice pork cut).  And you may choose from small, medium and large size bowls (8.95- 12.95 ala carte price).  The medium bowl is similar is size to comparable restaurants, and the large is the size of a mixing bowl, no lie.

Pickled eggs are part of any of the above ramens and only come in a &#34;set&#34;, or meal.  Sets include your choice of bowl size, plus the egg, plus a side and range from 9.95 o 13.95.

I opted for the medium Shoyu Ramen Set with Egg and Salmon/Salmon Roe.  After order it appears customary to join in the scramble to find a seat in the usually crowded court area and then wait for your ramen number to be called over the speaker.   At 1ish on a Saturday our wait was less than 10 minutes.

The bowls arrived steaming hot, which was great.  The broth was rich but didn&#39;t have the depth of flavor that other ramens I&#39;ve tasted have.  My favorite bowls have layers of scents and tastes that can only come from broth simmered for days.  But all my friends and I agreed; given the volume (the line was between 15-25 deep during our entire visit), this slow cooking wouldn&#39;t be feasible.

But the broth did have a mixture of pork and soy, and the dried seaweed was added at the end for garnish only.  The Cha-Shu pork Is simmered in soy sauce before being added to the bowl.  Overall this ramen is serviceable.

The pickled egg was good, but served cold.  I found this a bit odd since it&#39;s usually served on top of a warm noodles. So I flipped it into my bowl and gave it a bit of a bath.

The Salmon bowl was rather disappointment.  A small rice bowl was about 3/4 of the sticky white variety.  Very small shreds a nearly jerky-dried salmon was on top the rice and an ample portion of rather flavorless salmon roe was on the dried salmon.  Certainly not a dish I would order again.

Good experience overall but I believe I may be a bit spoiled by having some really great, slow cooked, deeply flavored ramen early in my experiences.   So for now I&#39;ll got with those and most likely try some of the other food court spots on future trips, and you may want to do the same.

Notes: The pictures steamed buns are from a neighboring counter and review separately.  And bring your cash because this counter, as well as all in this food court, are cash only.  There is an ATM in the marketplace with some pretty hefty fees."

The transliteration of SANTOUKA is &#34;Mountain Peak Fire&#34;, which certainly captures the intensity of each bowl of ramen they cook up. They are a franchise originating in Hokkaido.

Friend and I ventured in this afternoon to their Arlington Heights location in the Mitsuwa supermarket&#39;s food court. After enduring a 40 minute wait, we were able to finally savor the incredibly rich tonkotsu broths in our Shio and Toroniku ramen bowls respectively.

The noodles, menma (bamboo shoots), kikurage (jelly ear strips), narutomaki (fish swirl), and char-siu (pork jowl) ingredients synergize well to produce an epicurean emergence that challenges (but does not overwhelm) the taste receptors. 

Proceed slowly, and deliberately; center yourself before each slurp. Delicious."

Cons: Really dry hard-boiled egg, cash only

The review:

Ordered the Salt Ramen and Miso Ramen. Miso Ramen is the better one with undisputed better soup base. I found myself try to drink the heavily-flavored soup after finishing the soft and chewy noodles. The two pieces of cha-shu are pretty standard. Honestly, you would get better cha-shu somewhere else, but these will suffice. The egg is really what I really do not like. They put it on the side in a small cup with some soy sauce. The egg itself is seasoned, hard-boiled, but cooled and dry. I tried to put it in my bowl to give it some moisture and heat, but it did not help. The bowl of cha-shu rice that you can order to make it a combo is well worth it and super tasty. Mix it well and eat a big scoop. It is just great.

At Oiistar and other ramen places, you pay $12 for simply the bowl of ramen, but here it is about ~$14 for a large bowl of noodles and cha-shu rice. Good value. 

Tip: Number 89! Go all in with a large bowl of noodles and a decently-sized bowl of cha-shu rice! Mix the ingredients well. And finally, with the sturdier spoon they after all this time needed to upgrade, finish with big scoops of delicious cha-shu rice!"

After I had their Spicy Miso Ramen, I was in heaven again.  It&#39;s been a while since I had great food.  Since the winter season is nearby, I will be going to Santouka more often to satisfy my Ramen cravings.

I had ordered the Spicy Miso Soup Combo A.  This came with Negi Rice Bowl (Green Onions).  The soup had enough spice to just give it some kick.  One of the ingredients was pork and it was very tender and I couldn&#39;t get enough of it.   The noodles wasn&#39;t your typical packet ramens and tastes much better and I think it&#39;s fresh too.  I can&#39;t say I know what fresh noodles taste like but because it didn&#39;t taste like the packet noodles, I&#39;m guessing it is so.  Don&#39;t take my word for it though because I have yet to ask. The rice was good too.  It was obvious by the texture that they didn&#39;t use cheap minute kind of rice like some restaurants do.  I&#39;ve never had it with green onions, radish sprouts, fried tofu, and dried bonito seaweed.   It also comes with a brown hard boiled egg.  This was marinaded with soy sauce to give it that brown color.

I&#39;ll be coming back more often and I will be ordering a different soup each time so I can say I tried all their flavors."

We were craving ramen and we found this place on yelp, hopped in a cab, and fell in love. We both ordered the spicy miso ramen and can easily say that this was the best ramen we&#39;ve ever had. And trust me, we&#39;ve scouted out some really good ramen places in Texas.

The broth of the ramen was great, and not overbearingly heavy. Pork was tender and the noodles were the perfect texture; not soggy and not too hard. The only downside to this place is that eggs cost extra, which we aren&#39;t used to, being from Texas! The ramen here usually comes with an egg. However, that didn&#39;t stop us from craving this ramen our whole entire week long stay! We made sure to stop and eat here as our last meal before leaving to the airport.

The noodles were chewy, and the broth was silky. The perfect combination for a great dish of ramen noodles. In addition, they also have different sizes, so if you can&#39;t finish the typical giant bowl of ramen, you can still enjoy the food."

The food has always been delicious and our favorite waiter Jose always delivered excellent service. 
 
This past Sunday, however, was the last time we will ever go to Andy&#39;s Café.  Why?  New Ownership. This past Sunday we took our longtime friend with us to enjoy breakfast. We sat in Jose&#39;s section. He was attentive and took our order as usual, however a waiter is at the mercy of the kitchen. In the past it never took more than 10 minutes for our food to arrive.  This time it was 15+ minutes leaving the waiter, Jose, to apologize for the disorganization of the kitchen, something which he definitely is not accustomed to.  The order arrived incorrect (not Jose&#39;s fault) and there was further delay to boot.  The only positive thing about the experience was Jose was still employed there and did the best he could under the circumstances.  The part-owner, donning unprofessional attire, a Metallica black t-shirt and a backward hat, was very rude in how he was addressing customers, seemed bothered by routine requests and the fact that he had to go out of his way.  Many of the patrons were just in disbelief at the new &#34;tone&#34; of the restaurant and its owner.  Our table struck up conversation with other patrons who expressed disbelief at the way things were being run.  Everyone agreed this would be the last visit.
 
The food quality was poor, the food arrived late and was not how we ordered it. More importantly was the &#34;just deal with it&#34; side of rudeness that was served up with our food. After we paid our bill, I asked the Metallica t-shirt dressed man if he was the owner and he replied I&#39;m the partial owner.  I expressed that my husband and I had been coming here for years and told him about how our food took over 25 minutes, that the order was incorrect and that it was not good.  His reply?  &#34;Oh, well, sometimes you have to wait.&#34;  I then said honestly if you&#39;re part-owner, do you think wearing a Metallica T-shirt and backward hat is appropriate attire?  He told me my opinion doesn&#39;t matter and to get out of his restaurant. 
 
I can&#39;t even begin to express our disappointment in Andy&#39;s Café.  The only positive thing was Jose, who did the best he could with limited support.   We will not be visiting again.  

Think twice if you like good service, great tasting food and more importantly common courtesy.  What you will be assured of is bad food, long wait times with a side of rudeness.  Hope I saved someone a bad experience with this review."

I ordered liver, bacon and onions, which according to the menu, came with a choice of potatoes and a side of vegetable.  I was served the liver and onions and the potatoes but no bacon and no vegetable.  It wasn&#39;t worth the hassle of sending the food back.

I have been very critical in most of my reviews of places serving breakfast in Des Plaines but finally Andy&#39;s Cafe has what it takes to keep me returning.
Coffee is really good, service is fantastic, food is great.
With the only exception, in my personal opinion, is of their omelets ... I HATE FORMED OMELETS !!! Loss of a star for that one.
Continuing ... Their steak &amp; eggs are great - huge portions - and very reasonably priced for either the skirt or chopped.
Their side pancakes are also large, larger than some places regular order, and they don&#39;t crumble. The skillets have yet to disappoint me. 
And, as some others have mentioned, their soups are delicious.
The place has a real nice feel to it. The parking lot cannot accommodate this place during the peak hours.
Maybe the next time I&#39;m there I&#39;ll ask if they can fold an omelet, if so, then maybe I&#39;ll change this review to a 5 star."

I don&#39;t get to go here often anymore, and finally went this morning. We had Heather as our server, and she was AWESOME! So helpful and  friendly! The entire staff (especially the host) is so damn friendly every time we come in, it really make the experience that much better. ------------------------------------------
A friend of mine recommended Andy&#39;s for breakfast a year or two ago, and my soul has changed for the better ever since.
I really do not feel that I am exaggerating when I say that Andy&#39;s is the best place to get breakfast not just in Des Plaines, but pretty much anywhere I have had breakfast, when you consider all of the factors. I cannot think of enough positive things to say about them. 
1) The menu is diverse (numerous skillets, omelettes, sandwiches, potato pancake benedict, biscuits and gravy, and much more)
2) Extremely low prices
3) HUGE portions
4) The food is amazing, of course
5) The staff is so very friendly
6) Never had to wait long for a booth even when busy
I have never had a bad experience here. It gives you the simplicity and affordability that you would expect from a diner but also provides great taste, portions, and service. The last time I visited, my boyfriend  accidentally made the ketchup shoot out across the table (oops) and our server brought him a new plate of pancakes because a few drops got on them, without him even asking for a replacement. Our drinks are always refilled quickly and the service is always great.
I cannot tell you enough about how amazing the corned beef hash skillet is... I have a legitimate obsession. They load their skillets with soo much cheese, they are truly amazing. My brother is in love with the hobo skillet, which has three types of cheeses. The buttermilk pancakes are delicious and MASSIVE. I have a big appetite but can never leave this place without a waddle, lol. At IHOP you would spend twice as much money for half the amount of food and less taste. The subtle appearance of Andy&#39;s exterior does not do this place justice for how much of a staple it is in Des Plaines. I struggle to find any other dinner that matches the taste and hospitality of Andy&#39;s. I really, really recommend it to anyone who is looking for a very affordable and tasty breakfast. I am only sorry that I did not start visiting this place a long, long time ago. I would give ten stars if I could. Can you tell how loyal I am? Haha, please give it a try!"

Thanks for a great lunch.

Yelp has rejected this review but yet recommends a review from someone who states that their &#34;friend&#34; saw a rodent. That review lacks &#34;first hand&#34; experience because only the reviewers &#34;friend&#34; supposedly saw the rodent.

By rejecting my review and promoting the other review, Yelp is NOT prioritizing first hand experience over second hand hear say. Yelp will cease to be viable if they don&#39;t reexamine this unfair policy. I demand more explanation than an automated response.

This restaurant is clean, well managed, and serves simple delicious fare. I am simply a customer and unrelated to any or all owners."

Good thing was we were served coffee right away. Then, we waited and waited for more than 10 mins and still no one walk to our table to Indroduce themselves as our server.

I&#39;m not a fan of white cheese and when I stated that she still wanted me to try it anyway.

I&#39;ll make a long story short...my manager talked at me about my performance for about an hour, but in my head I was experience sheer ecstasy. I don&#39;t even remember our conversation because I was swan-diving headfirst into the best freaking Chicken Avocado Sandwich of my life. The chicken was grilled and tasty. The avocado was creamy and plentiful (it was REAL avocado). The bread was toasted and buttered perfectly. And those fries...holy cow, those fries were cooked in oil from the heavens. Nectar of the Gods, I tell you. The fries were so flavorful, crispy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside. They melted in my mouth. 

I went back here several times after that, and they didn&#39;t have the chicken avocado sandwich again! It was a special at the time, I guess. I ordered other items, like wraps and salads and such...but nothing ever as good as that world-famous Chicken Avocado Sandwich with Heaven Fries."

I was catered to here in this small little cafe more then when I was at a high end restaurant. 

Let&#39;s start with the Soup.. Omg they have the best soups ever. Not some out of the can into the bowl slop you receive at many places. 

I ordered a strip steak and eggs special and I was blown away by the taste and sheer size of the serving. Vegetables were cooked to perfection. Fresh rolls which kept coming even when we finished off a basket they brought out another without us having to ask.

The pricing for 5 of us to sit around and eat great food was well worth it.

Only issue is the parking lot is a little jacked up and not very large.

All breakfast items are so huge! You&#39;ll always have a bunch of leftovers and you&#39;ll get to enjoy for lunch! Num nums! I recommend trying the steak skillet... huge pieces of steak! Awesome!

They also have a &#39;healthy&#39; section to their menu, which really helps this little fatty enjoy the place even when I am trying to drop a few pounds :)

The skirt steak is comparable to any great restaurant and the portions are crazy big! Much, much better and much more quantity than all others in town that are often more expensive and not nearly as tasty!  Others often serve half the size steak for the same price or more! I Hop put only 3 small pieces of steak in my &#34;steak omelet&#34;!!!  Andy&#39;s has the best food in town of this genre and I challenge anyone to find better. For the quality and quantity you get, no other restaurant comes close. Sometimes even their steak goes on special. TRY IT! This place is the biggest secret in town!  I gladly put my name on this endorsement and as you can see, I will even painfully tell the whole truth! I just wish I could eat out more often!

Love their martinis. I&#39;d recommend the Key Lime Pie martini with the graham cracker rim and the Cake martini. 

They have good food and great appetizers. The Italian Panini is delicious but very messy. The appetizers, such as the Pretzels with cheese dip, Spinach Artichoke Dip, Traditional Teriyaki Wings, Southwestern Egg Rolls, Queso, Loaded Tots, and Nachos are all great choices. With plenty more options. Huge portions for the most part. 

Got a free dessert on my birthday as well.

The atmosphere at this location is great too. You got plenty of TVs, playing music videos all night. Pool tables in back which you can play if you pay hourly, it is not alot at all!

Likewise, the beer menu is confusing as far as determining what beers actually fall under it, I didn&#39;t know until it was explained by a friend what items fall under that.

It is a completely decent place to spend a weekend night, though not outstanding in any particular facet for a sports bar. Clientele consists of mostly younger people from the adjacent neighborhood who are still in the &#34;party&#34; as a verb stage in their drinking development. 

There are positive aspects of this bar for sure. They have plenty of TV&#39;s for sports, and it is a pretty great spot to post up on Sunday for this reason. They also have a wide selection of both on tap and bottled beers if you are a craft brew type of person. There are pool tables, darts, and a life size Jenga (yes, I am serious) for you to fill the time if you are hanging out with friends and need to check your 6 beers down dexterity. 

Service here is great if you are sitting at the bar itself and the bartenders are very courteous and chatty, especially if you come in frequently. A couple are smoking hot too, which never sucks. If you are sitting out at one of the tables the level of service takes a dive in a big hurry. On many occasions I just go to the bar to order my drinks to save time, especially on Friday and Saturday when the place gets pretty packed. 

Drinks here are fairly overpriced, even by chain standards. As such, I have even seen a few people taking &#34;pre-party&#34; shots in the parking lot on weekends before, likely from a bottle obtained from 7-11 just down the street. The silver lining is they do have daily drink specials which can make a night out at F&amp;H a bit more on the affordable side. See here:
http://www.foxandhound.com/locations/schaumburg/

Food here is of the typical bar food variety and like the drinks are similarly overpriced. None of it really sets the world on fire but it comes in handy in a pinch if you have beer muchines or are needing to slow your roll. Both the beer battered (and over-battered) chicken tenders appetizer and the cheese fries are what drunk people who are hungry have wet dreams about, and both will likely take about 2 years off of your life by consuming. The flat bread sandwiches are also pretty tasty if you are not feeling up to artery clogging bliss. 

Overall, this is a pretty decent place to hang out if you are local to the area. Just about every time I am in I see people who I recognize from previous visits, which can be either a blessing or a curse depending on what transpired on my previous visit."

To start off once you make your way through the doors you will be immediately see and be greeted by the hostess. Our hostess was Lee Ann and she seemed like a sweet person.

This place has Tvs mounted everywhere. The other rooms have shuffleboard, big Jenga and Pool Tables. She seated us at a booth and Becca our waitress came out to see what we wanted to order.

I was feeling really good the day I visited and I decided to indulge and try something new. Johnny Walker Blue Label for me and my buddy. It was smooth and was pleasant way to start off the night. The waitress was surprised at first and said we were the second people to ever order it. 

We ordered food. I had a mozzarella sticks and Cheeseburger with a side of tater tots.  The burger was seasoned well and the melted monetary jack cheese was delicious.

She also appeared to be the go to for operating the POS system for nonstandard issues.  Very impressed.   A glass was broken by one of the bartenders, and before the glass stopped splattering, someone from the back was already coming out with a broom and ban to clean up.

The place was pretty empty on a Saturday night, but the service was still terribly slow. We started just going to the bar ourselves, but then they couldn&#39;t put it on our tab, apparently only our waitress could.  When I complained that my drink was half empty, I was told it&#39;s because they use big glasses.

I had no idea putting it in a blender would be so time consuming. After agreeing to make our margaritas frozen, the server placed our order. While the bartender was making our drinks, he was pouring them into the glasses and was drinking straight out the blender he was serving us from. Disgusting. While all of this was going on, other servers were riding each other&#39;s backs running around slapping each other on their butts. Additionally, servers were dropping F bombs like nobodies business.

I haven&#39;t seen one of my girlfriends in about 10 years. We reconnected on Facebook a few months back and decided that it was about time to get together so we made plans for dinner and drinks last Friday. We hadn&#39;t chosen a place to go until a few days prior to our girls date, and I have been so busy lately that I asked her to help pick out a place which is totally unlike me. She mentioned F&amp;H and I found it hilarious because all I could think of how awful it was all those years ago when I last went. It was dirty and the food was gross and the service was an absolute joke.

I noticed the new signage a while back and kinda figured they must have revamped the place but I gotta say I was incredibly surprised this past weekend when I arrived to meet my gal pal for dinner and cocktails. 

They carded us at the door, which I love because I know we&#39;re in an establishment that takes their business seriously. 

There are individual tables along with long communal tables. At first, I wasn&#39;t crazy about the communal table we were seated at, but decided pretty quickly that I thought it made sense for a place like this. It encourages people to get comfortable and chat amongst each other. Except for when ADD guy at the opposite end of the table is badly drumming on the table and his buddy is hitting the base drum on the foot bar that runs the full length of the whole table. Yeah, those guys were AWESOME!!

Thankfully, our server was very good. She was attentive but not up our asses. My girlfriend ordered the Fish &amp; Chips which I learned was  her &#34;got to&#34; dish when she comes here. I asked our server and my friend about the chicken fingers and it seems they rank with the fish so I went for it. After all, I needed something carb-y for my cocktails to absorb! 

The fingers were good. They did not have too much breading and the ranch was also tasty. My complaint is that they put cheese and stuff on the fries. While others might like this, I did not. I found the cheese to be stinky and scraping it off the fries was more work than it was worth so only ate a few from the bottom of the basket, finding the fries could have used a little more time draining the oil because they were quite greasy. Not a fan.

The cocktails were yummy. We&#39;ll prepared and consistent. Not the most economical place to sip on my top shelf taste but very good drinks. The server was not pushing the booze and allowed us to drink responsibly. I really appreciated that! 

On a few trips to the ladies room, I noticed a giant connect 4 board, the giant Jenga set and noticed they have some trivia nights throughout the week so I can see this place is popular with the younger crowd. 

Overall, I enjoyed our recent visit. I will definitely be back and hopefully with my husband next time. It&#39;s a lot nicer than The Snuggery and cleaner, to boot! See you soon Fox and Hound!"
fox-and-hound-schaumburg-2,Stephanie C.,cZtgpKB6GkSjKjOF3LB8uw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,109,uXAhEEjzP5r2OMBPqWT6xQ,2.0,2016-08-07,"This doesn&#39;t seem like a bad place to hang out--it&#39;s clean, staff seemed friendly. But I had a really bad experience with a party/wristband deal. So when I say staff seemed friendly, I&#39;m very impressed, given the terrible management/set up. 

The person who coordinated the event with Fox and Hound was told (and then relayed to all the guests) that we had space in a party room and that there would be an optional wristband deal available--$25 for unlimited well drinks/cheap beer for 2 hours. However, when I arrived, I was told that not only was the wristband price increased to $32.50 (to reflect tax and gratuity?) but that everyone had to pay just to be in the room. I was driving, so I basically payed $32.50 to drink water. And even if this policy had been clear ahead of time (giving me the option of taking an Uber!) it&#39;s not in line with how other bars do these types of events. I was not in charge of this particular night, so maybe there was some miscommunication about the price and terms, but I have coordinated wristband deals/party rooms myself several times before at other bars (and have attended many more!) and have never heard of unexpected gratuity or making designated drivers pay for wristbands. The standard deal in my experience seems to be $20-30 flat for 2 hours, tax included and tip is extra--for example, the places in Chicago owned by Big Onion and Bar 1 Events (including Diag, Duffy&#39;s, McGees and Wrightwood Tap) all do it that way, and provide a much better experience. I also personally tip per drink at those places when I do drink, so end up actually paying more than $32--so doesn&#39;t everyone win?

The policy of charging just to be in the room became particularly ridiculous when as the night wore on (I was there from about 7:30-11:30), the bar never filled up! Not even close. It was shockingly empty for a Saturday night, I don&#39;t know how they&#39;re in business (overcharging for wristbands is not a great business model, but maybe it&#39;s working!). So there was really no reason to pay for a &#34;reserved&#34; space when we could easily have just had most of the bar to ourselves anyway.

Finally, the party room did not have its own bar. This really sucks for both patrons and waitstaff, as you have to either leave the room to go to the bar, or wait in one place until the overworked servers finally comes back with your beverage (or as I saw happen frequently, if you&#39;re the server, you have to waste your time trying to find the person who initially asked for that beer before deciding to wander off...).

Overall, it just didn&#39;t make a lot of sense, and I wouldn&#39;t go back."

I&#39;ve found myself here more often than any other bar in the area because they never disappoint.  This place is huge!  There are 3 different seating areas for you and your friends to conquer all during your nights of adult drinking activities.  

They have free large Jenga, which allows for some entertaining drunken debauchery.  There are quite a few pool tables and ping pong.  They have about one million TVs, (not really, but there are a lot.)

They used to have a beer &#34;bible&#34; which was awesome.  I&#39;m not sure if they still have it, but it was really helpful in picking out the next beer one $2 Tuesdays.  They have drink specials (I&#39;m pretty certain) every night of the week.  They usually put their week of specials in the convenient location of above the urinal.  Sorry ladies-not sure if they have such crafty advertisement placement in the ladies&#39; room.  

This is a great bar, open until 3 on the weekends and they play some good music with the accompanying music video-pretty much better than MTV ever was because you get to drink as well.

Stop in, check it out, and shut the bar down-or just enjoy a beer or two!

We were seated quickly (early enough in the day) by our quiet but courteous hostess, and seemed to have a good view of the game from any perspective. F&amp;H has numerous TVs showing a variety of sporting events, and if you couldn&#39;t find the match you were looking for I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be happy turn the dial to find it for you. 

It was a Saturday, so we discovered they have Makers Mark you-call-its on special, so we decided to indulge as this seemed like a special enough occasion. After the first round was in the bag, we switched to their beer list, of which they have many to choose from, and ordered the nachos as well.
Beer &amp; Nachos + alma mater football &amp; a carefree Saturday = a winning combo. 
The nachos came quick (that&#39;s what she said) and they were the perfect sharing plate for the table. A good sports food is one that doesn&#39;t require too much coordination/concentration; nachos clearly fit the bill because you basically just have to pull and eat. All explanations of how to eat nachos aside.....they hit the spot.

We signed up for the rewards program because we plan to be back to catch their pint night (Tuesdays) and spend another lazy Saturday there when the stars align and we actually get an opportunity for a lazy Saturday. In the past here (and at the BG location) we have made great use of their billiards and darts, and I understand they have a pretty nice package deal for hosting fantasy sports drafts. 

Hopefully we get a chance to come back soon."

We were told by the hostess to grab a table, which we did and waited patiently for someone to come help us. As time passed no one showed. So I headed up to the bar to see if someone was suppose to come take our order. Lisa, the bartender, who was very helpful got the manager to come by and help us out since our waitress, Jordan, mysteriously disappeared on a slow Sunday. Even the manager was perplexed on the fact that she wasn&#39;t to be found. So the manager kindly got our order and put it in and within seconds we got our drinks and a snack. As our drinks dwindled away, still no sign of Jordan at all. So again we headed up to the bar again to speak to Lisa. She kindly made our drinks for us as sent someone over again since now the manager seemed to have been gone now. A table sits behind us and sure enough Jordan comes and immediately helps that table but ignores ours. Then another table came and gave them service but not ours. How frustrating to be ignored by the person who was suppose to give us service in the first place. 

    Overall our experience here was so disappointing and frustrating. I will say though, the reason for the extra star is specifically for Lisa the bartender on that night. Despite the fact that she nearly looked to have a full bar, she was able to take to our needs when she was busy. She was very kind and understood our frustration and gave fabulous customer service. I tip my hat to you Lisa, thank you so much. Every one else, figure it out!"

The food is typical bar food, no stand outs in particular. The drinks were pretty good, the Irish car bombs got my boyfriend good! My two mixed drinks were kind of on the weaker side of things- disappointing...

Robert was there whenever we needed him to be but was never hovering.

The  revamped their menu and took off almost half of their items including my favorite,  Mac and cheese. I was bummed about that. I enjoyed their drunken chicken tenders though. 

I enjoy the atmosphere of this place, however lack of service sucks. It takes for ever for the waiters to come back and check on you. Half my table waited for 20 min for their first drink to arrive. And this was on a Wednesday. 

What really set me over the edge was the waitress who was in the area with the pool tables, darts, and jenga. I told her my order and she asked for my id. Nothing unusual. The first thing out of her mouth was that I needed an Illinois drivers license because I&#39;m not supposed to except this. Really?? I&#39;ve been drinking here for over 2 hours! Who are you to tell me I need to get a new drivers license. What if I&#39;m truly from out of state and here visiting? Are you going to deny me service? I&#39;m sure you would be denying a lot of customers service. 

Second we brought  the jenga closer to our table because it was near another group and they were not using it. She came up to us and asked us where we got it from. I&#39;m like over there and I pointed, near the darts. Shes like &#34;we&#39;ll make sure you put it back because it&#39;s hostesses responsibility to out it away and they never do it. Then I have to do it and I really don&#39;t want to.&#34; Really??? You work in customer service! Where the majority of your income is tips! Don&#39;t tell me to do something that is your responsibility. I moved it... I kid you not... 10 feet. It is really not that hard to put away. Don&#39;t be lazy.

Yes when it&#39;s completely packed it can get pretty slow but get over it.  The past couple times when I&#39;m in town and order food from here it has always been above average.  All the apps are great and the burgers are a+!  When the bar scene rolls in it can get a little crazy and service can become slow but since they updated the menu I can&#39;t complain!

Finally had to chase her down and ask her to stop by so we could order. She acted pissy like I was putting her out. She never came around again to ask if we wanted another so we left. Seemed like she was too busy flirting with patrons to do her job. Also the TVs were so loud with conflicting programs blaring you had to shout to have a conversation.

When I arrived, I stood in line only to be told that the postal worker with my box was not back from their route yet. The employee behind the counter asked me to return before the post office closed at 7p. 

I agreed to do that. We decided to stay within the area and eat. Sushi Ya is closed on Mondays. We drove N on Roselle Rd to give Nobu a try. Well, they&#39;re out of business. 

We were running out of time for a leisurely sit down meal.  Since we were already in this strip mall, Jason and I decided this was our opportunity to give Fox and Hounds a try.

It&#39;s a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. The main room has high tops, tables, booths and stools. There is only one bar in this huge, somewhat compartmentalized establishment.

What keeps the square footage&#39;s integrity are large glass windows instead of dry wall creatively dividing up the space. One room has pool tables with high tops for a place to rest. People can eat, drink and play the game without interruptions. To get to the bathrooms, we needed to walk through the dining room. I never want to be seated and served in that section. I got the vibe I was in the common room at a retirement home.

My boyfriend and I shared the jalapeño poppers and brownie a la mode. I enjoyed their mac&#39;n&#39;cheese. I don&#39;t recall what my boyfriend ate but he finished his plate.

Our server, Linsday, was funny and delightful. I felt bad for her when she shared stories about unruly customers. I don&#39;t know why people have to be so rude."

Their drinks are always affordable and beats chicago prices, obviously. They have beer towers for $20-30 and last time we counted out about 9 beers from one tower of blue moon ($28ish), totally worth it and way cheaper than buying blue moons individually. 

I participated in the fantasy football draft party this year. You go to fox and hound, draft out your teams and you get $25 (or was it $50) to spend at your party. The commissioner always gets $25 each month for 4 months which was a nice bonus. We&#39;ll probably end up coming here and doing that again next season.

The downside of fox and hound is their food, lots and lots of salt is used. Everything we&#39;ve had to eat was pretty mediocre and not very memorable. Their wings are good and some of their burgers but other than that, I can&#39;t say much positive stuff."

And every single time, it takes us a year to forget how horrible our experiences can be.  Service is always lousy, and it takes forever to place an order and then to receive order, and then another 15 minutes for silverware, napkins, etc.  

The food was okay, but at the prices they charge, I would expect 5 star taste.

The ambiance was awful. If I wanted to be forced to sit on a metal folding chair at a billiard table covered with plywood and watch football on a projector screen with terrible color (I don&#39;t think Jay Cutler is black), I would have gone down to the basement of my parent&#39;s home that is stuck in 1982.

we went to fox after a concert a couple of weeks ago. the service was so bad, we left. i left a mostly full beer sitting on the table.  the bottomless chips and salsa? not so bottomless if no one ever comes back to the table.  the 4 of us were done with them before our drinks arrived!

we even managed to flag a manager after waiting 30 minutes for our initial drinks. he brought them after another 10, looked at the empty bowl of chips, and walked away.  5  minutes later, our server comes with our drink order, looks surprised that we have drinks, and leaves.

10 minutes later, we flag the manager down, nicely ask for the check, pay, and leave.

i dont think ive ever had such bad service.  ever, anywhere.

They have $2 draft beers, all their tap beers are just $2... Blue Moon? $2. 312? $2. Yuumm and easy on your wallet!  Wednesdays are fun too for ladies night, deals deals deals.  I&#39;m all about the coupons and the deals!  Also joined the &#34;All Star Club&#34; to rack up points and you get a free birthday meal too!  They also have themed nights,  trivia nights, and they just recently remodeled and added more games like lifesized Jenga &amp; Connect-4 to their collection of games that already included pool tables, darts, ping-pong, and shuffleboard!  They added a few nice lounge areas with leather couches and chairs, which I really like!  They have 3 separate rooms you can hang out in and loads of TVs.

Upon walking in we were greeted by Ana. Very nice and pleasant.  

Our server was Kelsey. I cannot say enough nice things about her. Very friendly and sweet. She signed us up for the All Star rewards card so we earned points right away and we get a free meal on our next visit. 

For the appetizer we ordered the spinach artichoke dip. It comes with what I think are freshly made chips because they were pretty hot in temp when she brought them out. The dip is a hot dip (yum) and it was probably one of the best dips I&#39;ve had in a very long time.  I kinda wish I could have some now. 

I ordered the B.Y.O.B burger with blue cheese. It was perfectly cooked and tasted splendid. 

My mom ordered the steak salad which she absolutely loved. I tasted the steak and not only was it juicy and tendered but it was seasoned with perfection.  

No dessert during this visit but I&#39;m going to guess that anything we order in the future will be just as great as today&#39;s experience.

We wanted to go somewhere that we could get &#34;wholesome&#34; food, for not a lot of money. We decided against Portillo&#39;s but had the ingenious thought of going here.

We were seated immediately (on a Sunday evening at about 6:30). The restaurant was less than half full. Those that were there appeared to be 20 somethings intent on getting drunk. But, that&#39;s okay. It was kind of fun watching them and recalling the good old days.

We ordered simple - I had a french dip with fries, Kerrie had a Reuben with onion rings. I have to admit we were pretty hungry, and it took longer than we expected to get our food. But, neither of us said anything and when the food came out, we were happy. The french dip was a little nontraditional - it had a horseradish sauce on it that added some nice kick. And, it was served on a Chiabata bun, which is of course different than the more traditional french roll. Kerrie&#39;s Reuben was great, and the onion rings were outstanding - large, crisp and not greasy.

After only a few minutes of eating, the manager came by our table to offer us free desert since it took so long for the meal to arrive. While we both thought it took a long time and neither of us said anything about it, this was quite surprising. But, we did accept. (Who turns down free food?)

They only have one desert on the menu - a warm cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This is no simple cookie. It is served in bake ware about 4&#34; x 6&#34;. It&#39;s a meal in and of itself. It was very hot when it came out, so it appeared almost to be like a souffle - it deflated some when the spoon hit it. I don&#39;t eat deserts like that, but Kerrie said it was amazing. And, as I said, not being one to turn down free food, I asked if they would allow me to have an after dinner drink, to which they graciously complied. I finished my meal with a Sambuca and a plan to return to the Fox and Hound soon."

Went there with my girlfriend to watch the Rousey UFC fight on August 1st.  Walked in and there was a $5 cover to watch the fight.  Not a huge deal, but the doorman wouldn&#39;t tell me if there were available seats and we were left to fend for ourselves to find a seat.  Then, they opened the front room to watch the fight.  If we had only sat at the bar we would&#39;ve watched it for free!  Actually, the TVs in the main bar would have been better anyway.  The projection screens in the back rooms have seen better days.  The largest screen in one room had severely distorted color issues while the one I was watching had white spots all over it.  Made watching the fight an unpleasant experience.

Then there were the drinks.  I asked for a bourbon with little ice.  Paying nearly $10 a glass I expect it to come how I asked.  The bartender did what I asked but then her bartending partner felt the need to add more ice.  I was not pleased by this.  Took my first sip and there was a piece of grit in the first sip.  Took it back to the bar and the first bartender provided me with a new drink.  Good news...I had the amount of ice I asked for the first time.  I went for a second glass later on and this time, there was something on the outside of the glass and on the water glass as well.  Luckily, it was only on the outside.

Overall, it felt like the owners/managers have put this place on cruise control.  The staff did their best which I appreciate."

Lots to choose from and the various apps we tried were all tasty.  Please note - their Big Tex Poppers are HOT! I&#39;ve had plenty of jalapeno poppers but these ones were spicier than your usual poppers. The dog bites (mini corn dogs) were good &amp; had a different coating on them, and everything on the sampler platter (which is HUGE) was good, especially the beer-battered onion rings.  They also have an extensive beer list.

We were there with a large group and our server was fantastic.  I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve failed to remember her name but she was friendly &amp; just the right amount of attentive for a big group on a busy Friday night.

What I didn&#39;t like?  3 things:
1. The drink specials may seem like a good deal but the glasses were filled to the brim with ice and they weren&#39;t even remotely strong.  I mean, on an empty stomach you would not even feel the effect of having one of two of the drink special cocktails.

2. No beer specials on Friday nights.

3. It&#39;s 98% high tops with backless bar stools - with only a couple of couches &amp; regular chairs off to one side.  I hate high tops.  Throw in backless bar stools and you can rest assured I&#39;m not coming back unless the location isn&#39;t my choice.  After spending several hours here visiting with friends my back was killing me from such an uncomfortable perch.

So, since not everyone despises high tops like I do I&#39;ll settle on 3 stars since the food &amp; service was quite good."

Even the bartenders can be hit-or-miss, and that&#39;s new to me since generally I&#39;ve found bartenders can help make my experience more enjoyable.

There were about 15 of us there for a work event.  One server who would come be every 15 minutes with drinks the order she took 15 minutes prior.  In fact I got a scotch on the rocks, and the ice had almost completely melted.  She actually said &#34;I swear there was ice in there&#34;.  The worst part is when two of my coworkers were brought the beers they ordered, she didn&#39;t remember which was which.  One guy tasted a beer, and it was wrong.  She had no intension of replacing that for the other guy, and because it was a work thing and one of the guys was new, he decided not to make a big deal of it.  There must have been a major sale in salt, and that&#39;s the only thing we tasted in the chips and salsa we got - yuck!!

Maybe guys go because the servers are supposed to be attractive.  With the attitudes they have, it&#39;s not worth it.  Zero stars for this place, even though I have to give 1 to post. They don&#39;t deserve any."

The layout is typical of a sports bar, but with a very open floor plan.  The menu is the same as in Arlington Heights, my usual stop, which is to say a bit limited, but well thought out.  At lunch, the latest menu has standout offerings for a limited selection of items for (as of latest visit) $8 -10 w/o drinks. The chicken tenders are among the best, at least when tossed in hot wing sauce and served with ranch on the side.  The Black Forest sandwich is also a winner. The service this visit was very friendly given that our group hung around for 3+ hours, and it was exceptionally well provided.   Two items of concern:  Check your bill - they charged the dinner price rather than the special Lunch price for 2 items on our last visit, and for some reason coffee is charged by the cup (so maybe don&#39;t order it here at a BAR)!."

Pros- 
This place is very large and has plenty of seating and TVs. It&#39;s a great place to meet with a large group. The back room has all sorts of games to play and during the week nights they can be free to play. On the weekends the games come at an hourly rate. The only good food I have had here are the chicken wings.

Cons-
I could do with some slightly lower prices for drinks here. Everything seems to be overpriced. The mixed drinks are ok but again, overpriced. The food is nothing special. The chips they make in the kitchen would be awesome, if they didn&#39;t take a bath in salt after they were made. We asked for no salt one night and they said they wouldn&#39;t do that. 

There&#39;s usually a good crowd and it&#39;s a great place for larger groups, but there are better places in the area."

But, I&#39;m writing a review finally given my pleasant surprise with their revamped food menu.
.
Atmosphere: Great place to catch any type of game.  Lots of big screen TVs in HD in all the different sections of the bar/restaurant.  Not too crowded, but enough people there that are into the games to raise the excitement level vs. watching the game at home.  
.
Food: Their menu has been revamped recently, and all for the better.  Had the Barnyard Cheeseburger with Fried Egg that was delicious, and upgraded the fries to Onion Rings instead and those bad boys were HUGE, deep fried just right, and luckily got them hot &amp; fresh right out the deep fryer.  Also, their pretzel stick apps were huge portions, but still fresh and soft, and complemented very well by the cheese sauce.  (See pics)
.
Service:  depending on how busy it is, it may take some time for a server to track you down.  But, once they do, service is usually spot on.  Terri found me in the midst of several large parties that were going on yesterday, and was very friendly, and checked on me several times while I was there.  I can say, in the handful of times I&#39;ve ,the service has been consistently friendly and attentive.
.
Plenty of beers to choose from, and plenty of people have commented on that already.
.
Great local hangout, and given the menu revamp, will definitely repeat during the remainder of the NBA playoffs in the upcoming week, for not only their beers, but food as well.

We sat in the game room area with 5 people and just had drinks and some appetizers while we played ping-pong. 

Negatives: When we went in, I asked for the ping-pong table and was sat right next to it but no one mentioned that there was a waiting list for it. Same thing for the pool. 
Our server was slow but forgiven for the fact that they were busy. I recommend ordering your new drink when you are half-way through your other drink. 
I paid $14 for a Kwak Beer. Still can&#39;t believe it or get over it. Seriously?

Positive: Food was good though. (chicken tenders &amp; potato wedges)

Join their All Stars club and earn points towards gift certificates, cheap drinks and half price wings (once you get to that point you get 10 wings for $4---not bad!). 

The service is hit or miss. Sometimes we get fantastic waitresses who are super friendly &amp; attentive. Other times we are left wondering where the heck our server is &amp; why they are ignoring our requests! 

Bathrooms are always extremely clean which is always a good thing!

They have some arcade games, darts, ping pong and a couple pool tables which adds to the atmosphere. Karaoke nights are hilarious but be aware some people take them very seriously bringing their kids, grandparents, everyone who knows them. We like going here to watch games as there are tons of TVs all over, tons of seating.

They play awesome music although sometimes it&#39;s just a tad too loud.

Fox definitely gives me that local bar feel and I will continue going, even with a few faults here and there. :)"

I used to think they had this amazing beer list because it was long... but it&#39;s just a bunch of typical stuff you can find anywhere, not a lot of craft specialties.  My server last week didn&#39;t know the difference between Lagunitas and Leinenkugel.  That&#39; s not a good sign.

Service was spotty, iffy at best when we said we weren&#39;t going to have another round.

The location and sectioned off room for the event was fine. Our waitress however pick and chose the times she came by. When she first brought our drinks, she would rush by every two minutes. But after our drinks had been consumed (same with our food), it would be about 20 minutes before we saw her again. I also had to ask for water twice because she forgot to bring me it between the half hour it took her to also bring our beers. I also asked for a second water which I never received (granted, it&#39;s water, but it&#39;s the principle of it).

We ordered wings (hot and spicy garlic) and they were flavorless, bland and far from spicy. The nachos, and chips and salsa were fine. 

Overall, I was disappointed with the wings and, especially, the service."

We walked in 5 minutes before kickoff and the only thing available for 4 and a child was a 4 top booth in the bar. Not the best case scenario but we were happy to get a seat at all. We were greeted promptly by the lovely Allie who told us the specials (sundays are $4 fireballs $6 mimosas $6 build your your own absolut bloody marys among various beer specials). Our beers and fireball came out very quickly for how busy they were and were both ice cold. As we were perusing their menu we were approached by Meagan, who had noticed that our seating situation was less then stellar. She had found us seats at one of their fold out tables and chairs in the back room with more than enough room for 4 adults and a rambunctious toddler.  I am truly appreciative and taken aback that Megan took it upon herself to remedy our issue. We were having a pretty crappy day and it was turned around by the wonderful staff at Fox and Hound. Walking into a packed sports bar with a toddler isn&#39;t usually a great experience but Megan truly turned our frowns upside down!"

The managers need to be trained better to help. We Came in on a Saturday night for dinner drinks 4 people 2 couple in our 30&#34;s. We sat down for dinner they ask for our credit card if we want to eat dinner. I Can understand maybe people run out on there bill but the way it was said was just so rude. We order dinner and drinks. the waitress was so slow it was crazy. we wanted to drink and have fun. We couldn&#39;t get drinks to save our life. went to the bar 2 times paid cash to get drinks because the waitress was so backed up with tables. food was ok but we decided we would go somewhere else after dinner cause we couldn&#39;t get served there. It took us 25 min to get her to give us our bill. I now no why people leave on the bill. You cant get anyone to your table place is run so bad. Its sad cause this is the 3rd time with bad times there. We like the feel of the place and games but they are clue less.

Pros: Tons of space, tons of seating, tons of tvs.
Typical darts and pool. Shuffleboard is fun and different. Life-size Jenga and Connect Four is also different, but only fun for about three minutes until you remember you&#39;re not five anymore and not so easily entertained.

Cons:
Way too loud! I was there on a Sunday night with four friends sitting at a table, and we couldn&#39;t even hear each other talk. We asked the manager to possibly turn the music down a bit and she replied with, &#39;sorry, I can&#39;t do that.&#39; Seeing as we were five of the eight people in the building, not the best customer service.
Overpriced for what it is.
Food is simply not good. I do like the Black Forrest sandwich, but that is literally the only thing I&#39;ve got there that wasn&#39;t just plain bad.
Tax on liquor. No one wants to go to the bar and pay $6.47 for their drink.

I&#39;ve had one of their reward cards for years, and still have no idea what it does for me. I swipe it every time, but see no perks. Maybe the points expire, and I just don&#39;t go there enough to rack up worthy points? And I don&#39;t expect that to change."

Outstandingly bad- enough to hope nobody else experiences this. 
Took us over
2 hours to eat lunch- slow food, mistakes from kitchen/ waiter, spilled dishes, inefficient order taking and table waiting. No snacks to munch on, no appetizers offered during excessively long wait for food. Nothing extra offered to compensate staff&#39;s mistaken orders or spilled orders. 
Odd. 
Atmosphere was great- games etc. great idea- poor service/ 2 people opening doors, one waiter on the floor 
We were only patrons- party of 15 soccer players and parents. 
Surprisingly disappointing because of very slow/ unorganized service. 
We are a friendly group and enjoyed time together - they are fortunate I think , that we were so patient and we&#39;re trying to fill 2 hours between games as the food and Bill took more than that to arrive. 
Perhaps they had a very off day, but I think that they are relying on the &#34; circus&#34; rather than service.

They all know each other really well as I heard waitresses talking about stabbing a cutsomer in the ear with a straw for not moving, in a crowded bar, where people drink. What do you expect??? Rude staff. I was also told to move to a different seat in the bar because I was in the way of the bar tender needed to pass waitresses their drinks for their tables. I hadn&#39;t been served yet and I wasn&#39;t in the drink passing zone (which is on the other side of the bar) Once I moved they decided (amongst the chaos) that it was most important at that moment to confiscate my half empty water bottle that we had thru our entire dinner that the door greeter and our waitress noticed and said nothing... The whole time I was trying to throw the half empty water bottle away but when someone snatches something from you while you&#39;ve been patiently waiting to order I wanted to see a manager. They told me their too busy to bring out the manager, and I said you should have thought about that when you rudely threw my water away which I can get for free at the bar anyways so wth. They continued to rudely explain why I can&#39;t have a water bottle and I grew more impatient. I told the bartender straight up, your being rude, that&#39;s why I want to see your manager. Word of obvious advice if you ever work in the food/service industry, say HELLO to your customers first. So please Fox &amp; Hound just serve your customers and stop worrying about water bottles on a friday night.

Server approached all smiles. This was good,  but things went downhill from there.  After she took our order,  she basically disappeared.  We didn&#39;t see her again until we asked another employee if she could find her and send her to our table. When she returned she was super matter of fact like nothing was wrong. No table visit to ensure our orders were correct.  No drink refills. Nada. Needless to say we promptly asked for our check,  paid cash and LEFT! We by-passed a boatload of restaurants to get here tonight and spend our hard earned money.  We CHOSE Fox &amp; Hound purposely,  and were looking forward to it.

However, we had a wonderful experience. I am judging on drinks, service and environment since I did not order any food.

We came its a group of 8 and decided to out 2 tables together in the pool table area. A waitress greeted us promptly and got our drinks order. She asked right away if we would like separate checks, which was very nice of her to do so right away, and I&#39;m sure makes her work easier in the end.

I got the PINeAPPLe UPsIDe DOwN CAKe (You&#39;ll flip for this mix of Malibu Coconut, banana liqueur, pineapple juice and grenadine). I was hoping that it would have some whipped cream on it, but that was just my wishful thinking. The drink was very sweet but very yummy. The taste and smell very much reminded me of Mexico, and the drinks they serve at the resorts. Good memories sparked. Everyone else noticeably also enjoyed their drinks.

The pool tables were not occupied so we decided to play some pool too.

The waitress seemed on hand any moment that we needed her, but she was never too pushy. She even took a picture with us.

The bathrooms were very clean, which is always a plus for a casual hang out place.

I still find it weird that on a Saturday night it was very empty, I guess maybe it was just an off day.

The next warning sign was that although the joint looked busy, there were empty tables available immediatly at 7:30 p.m. on a Friday night (ding, ding, ding, ding!!!).

I have to agree with other reviews of this venue... It&#39;s LOUD!  You cannot hear someone standing next to you, how annoying!

We were seated in a n &#39;off to the side&#39; room, which was very pretty and clean. Lots of natural light and stone accents gave it a fancy feeling. The windows looking into the bar could have been cleaned better, since the smudges were very visible during the afternoon. The food was good. The sausages, bacon, fresh fruit , and hash browns were nice and fresh. The french toast was okay, didn&#39;t get any butter which was a let down. The coffee was average, the first time I asked for cream I got milk, they gave me cream on the second cup , though, which was random. 
The staff was very, very good. The woman, Kris (?) was doing a lot of tasks at once but still managed to keep a smile on her face and treat the customers well. There was another girl with short brownish red hair who was helpful through the whole event and did a great job as well.

The place is absolutely gorgeous overall and everyone is extremely friendly. 
I was kind of disappointed because I am a Mac n Cheese fanatic and wanted to have some of it as a side. I asked our waitress if we could order it as a side considering the fact that it was not available but you could sometimes ask and they make it for you. She mentioned that I would not be able to order it as a side but it was still before 4pm so we were able to order from the Lunch specials. I was also craving a steak so I had to order the lunch special as well as the steak.. double the food. 
I was a bit overwhelmed with all of the food I ordered considering I only wanted the mac n cheese as a side with my steak. Anyhow, the food was absolutely delicious. I had received a steak with potatoes and cheese as well as a caesar salad and my mac n cheese. The steak simply melted in your mouth it was cooked to perfection. The portions of the mac n cheese and the salad were great but of course I was too full and couldn&#39;t even touch my potatoes. I felt terrible I couldn&#39;t eat it but if they were able to substitute the potatoes for my mac n cheese it would&#39;ve been fine. I mean, I guess all the more reason to make me spend more money for my cravings but it would&#39;ve been nice if it was substituted.

Second time I&#39;ve been here and won&#39;t be back again. Terrible experience. Service was slow and so many issues with just one meal!!

Drinks: waitress accidentally spilled the tray of drinks so the first beer flight had 2 choices with only half glasses. Thought she would bring a bit extra back to full up the glasses but not. Sorry but if I&#39;m paying for it, I should be getting the full amount. Next flight: they ran out of one of the choices and the bartender assumed he could give anything he wanted as an alternative. How about tell the customer that you are out and let the customer pick an alternative? 

Appetizers: other than bedtime slow, nachos were done wrong. ordered nachos with the queso on the side. Kitchen couldn&#39;t understand that and put everything on the nachos. Had to request for a remake.

Dinner: was told when appetizers were brought out that the prime rib sandwich sold out. That couldn&#39;t have been told to us earlier after order was placed like 40 minutes ago? When dinner came out, the sea scallops were overcooked and the risotto was undercooked and dry. Replaced with mahi tacos instead but kitchen failed to correctly send the order as ordered.

Definitely recommend the beer flights. At under 5 dollars for a sampler of 4, the flights are a no brainer.  Their blueberry Long Island is a refreshing twist on a traditional cocktail infused with a blueberry purée. 

From the appetizers order the wedge salad. One salad will comfortably feed up to 4 people. The crisp salad is topped with bleu cheese crumbles, grape tomatoes, red onions and crispy onions. It&#39;s crunchy, refreshing and can be easily substituted as a side for the table to split with their entrees.

Best entree I tried on their menu was the Mediterranean shrimp scampi. I rarely order pasta entrees but this pasta might have me reconsider that decision. Jumbo sautéed shrimp is tossed in a buttery warm pesto beurre blanc sauce. ( Honestly have no idea what that is but think deliciously warm melted butter)   

The dish was served with a Parmesan Italian bread that was perfect for soaking up every last drop of that beurre blanc sauce. 

Awesome chain addition for the Schaumburg area."

The first was fantastic due to the customer service and lunch specials/drink specials. Was just in last night had the stout flight some appetizers (braised short rib flat and nachos) and a jumbo lump crap burger which tasted amazing. I ordered it medium with sweet potato fries and it came out well done with regular fries but it&#39;s ok because our server was able to get me sweet potato fries no problem. The regular fries were super salty though. 

The overall experience was okay until the end. It was about 11:30-11:40pm and I felt like our server was trying to rush us out clearing out all of the plates and cups. I wasn&#39;t even finished eating the other half of my burger and he picked the plate up and cleared everything off. I was like mmmm ok I guess it&#39;s time to go then. He did mention they closed at midnight when we asked, but still. I do not appreciate the feeling of being rushed. I still gave a 20% tip and we were never rude to you. The beer was great and food was too. I just don&#39;t know if there is anything really that wow&#39;ed me that would bring me back here."

The beer flight is a must have. You can have one of four options, three of them they are on the menu but the gem is the create your own. I had two of them and must say all were extremely good. Will return for the beer. Now onto the food, we stated we the pretzels and beer cheese, which were really good. The beer cheese is just spectacular, and the pretzels are not too salty at all. We also had the charcuterie plate which was better than we expected. The sriracha cheddar was unbelievably good, also the red dragon was great. The wild boar bratwurst was the perfect complement to the cheese, also the chutney and prosciutto were great. Main courses that we had we the Bennie Mac &amp; Cheese which has chicken, pepper jack cheese, bacon and breadcrumbs. Shrimp tacos with a spicy black bean and corn salsa which were phenomenal and the spicy chicken sandwich which is some the most tender chicken. Our waiter was super attentive and awesome, I told him what beer I liked and during my flights had him surprise me with two choices which both times were right on the money. I wish I could remember his name but he was great. All in all a definite return in the future."

My husband has been wanting to try it, we were going to a comedy show at the Improv so it was meant to be. I made a reservation that morning and it was ready when we arrived 15min before our reserved time. The staff all smiled as we walked in and said hello . They were pretty busy , being a Saturday night. The decor is great, not a lot of foo foo on the walls or loud colors, great for a date night! 
   Our waiter , Aiden , was WONDERFUL !!!! I asked about a few dinner options I picked and couldnt decide on which to go with, so I went with the mac and cheese and it was the right choice  my husband mentioned to him it was our first visit so he told us about their beer so he got a flight to try a few out. Our appetizer came super fast and we shared an Asian Salad , it was delicious ! I cant see myself going there and not ordering that salad, it was that good. We got our meals and the manager, Mark , came over and heard it was our first visit and gave us a bag of fresh cookies with a card for a complimentary appetizer for our next visit... What?!?!? I have never in my life been shown that kind of welcome and appreciation for trying out a restaurant . I did visit some disappointing places in Rosemont lately so it was very refreshing to be welcomed and treated like a customer , one that is appreciated and valued . Because of that, we are telling everyone about this place and going back next week for sure. The lemon cake is a MUST, When asked how we liked it, I told Aiden it was like summer on a plate  so refreshing and just enough lemon flavor without going overboard . Thank you Aiden and Mark for making us your new usual customers , you guys were amazing and we look forward to seeing you again."

I love the location. It&#39;s away from the busy mall. Has its on parking lot. It&#39;s clean, it&#39;s appeasing to the eyes, there&#39;s a nice mix of patrons, and the ambiance is very nice. As stated, we all wanted to brunch so the menu is typical of a brunch menu WITH THE EXCEPTION OF these bomb ass Reggiano hash browns!! Oh My Goodness! That&#39;s a brow raising dish right there. I always admire an original dish. That&#39;s a rarity nowadays!! The other items are basic...ya know...scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, mash potatoes, waffles, fruit, carving station, etc.

Our server was Wade and he is phenomenal!! He is attentive! Pleasant! Quick!! Fun!! Social! Knowledgeable... Everything I can ask for and more. 

The only cons for Granite City are the Mimosas and the prime rib. I&#39;m not a drinker so when I do drink at brunch, I opt for a nice Mimosa. Normally Mimosas are sweet. Something my taste bugs require and delight over in an alcoholic beverage. I mean, it has OJ in it for Pete sakes!! OJ makes everything better  however these Mimosas taste funny. It wasn&#39;t sweet at all and the champagne used was very dry. Like...make ur face do this  dry. So dry, the dryness overwhelmed the sweetness of the OJ. I was pissed b/c that was $6! For a Mimosa try a nice Asti Spumante...I guzzle that up and I can still hold my head up high (since most ppl look at me like this  when I say I don&#39;t drink).

The prime rib was more red  than I would&#39;ve like. It was so bloody it was dripping onto my delicious second helping of Reggiano hash browns. I couldn&#39;t eat it...I like my meat medium well. A LIL peak of pink...not red. I&#39;m not a vampire  and I HATE wasting food (blame my parents). However I wouldn&#39;t write this place off b/c everything else was sublime!! (Just stay away from the prime rib and mimosa unless that&#39;s your thing )"

This brewery is a chain brewery with many locations.  The space is very modern and clean, with ample tables and bars seats.  Despite having a large lunch crowd, our party of 8 was seated promptly.  

The food menu is quite vast, with many standard offerings you would expect from a bar.  Wraps, flatbreads, salads, soups, burgers, sandwiches...etc.  I must say, the food was better than expected.  It was definitely a step up from your standard bar food.  Not that overly greasy, extremely salted or over seasoned stuff.  I had the soup of the day and a burger and found both to be spot on.  The burger was cooked to perfect temperature.  Despite there being a full head of lettuce on the burger, I have zero complaints.  

Since this was a work function, I did not get to try any of the beer...how stupid is that?  But I did check out the beer menu.  They have a Hefeweizen, Bock, American Lager, a Pale Ale, a DIPA and an Oatmeal stout.  They offer several sampler/flight options to fit your taste.

Overall, I liked this spot.  I will be back for more food and hopefully for brews this time.  I will update my review after I had a few beers."

We ordered the pretzels with cheese as well as the cheese soup. He did not tell us that they were the exact same thing, and when we asked him about it he got very rude and dismissive saying really that it was our fault for ordering them both. We then asked if we could get a different soup instead he said sure but since I already gave you the cheese soup you&#39;ll have to pay for both. We never asked him to comp us on the soup he just assumed and was very rude about it. Then right after we told him that our main courses came out so we promptly told him we wouldn&#39;t need the soup anymore, he said well I literally just put it in the system to get for you. You really don&#39;t even want it now? We told him no and he said great now I have to run to cancel it. He then avoided our table really until it was time for us to get our check and leave. I have never been talked to by a waiter the way he talked to my mom and I. At one point neither of us had anything to drink because he ignored us for so long. It&#39;s really a shame too because our food was so good but the service was so poor it ruined the whole night. Giving it two stars because the food was good but it was pretty pricy for what it was and the service was so horrible like I said it ruined the whole night."

I made 7:00 reservations for 3 people on a Saturday night. We got there at 6:30 and knew we would have to wait a half hour to be seated. However, they were behind on all reservations and we did not get seated until just after 7:30!

I understand it&#39;s busy and guests may stay longer than anticipated, but why make reservations? Unacceptable in my opinion so I won&#39;t be back.

But, it did not end there. Our waitress was nice, took our order and asked if she wanted our 3 year olds food out before ours. Whose food came out first? OURS! And then while we were finishing up, another server came by while our waitress was at our table and asked her if she got her paycheck. I&#39;m sorry but really? How unprofessional.

The food was good, beer just meh. And to wait over an hour? Sorry. I have and will continue to have way better dining out experiences in the city of Chicago. Sorry Schaumburg."

We ordered our drinks and the pretzels with cheese for an appetizer. 5 pretzels and some cheese for $9...not too bad. I wish the cheese tasted better. It was kind of watered down tasted.. didn&#39;t really have much of a taste at all. The pretzels were super salty.. tasted like they were microwaved.

We both ordered medium bison burgers. Mine had no pink and my husbands was pink... His ended up being a lot messier. They were good, but nothing outstanding.

The cheeseburger from the kid menu is tasty and the oldest monster dug it. I was impressed by the quality of their kid menu items. It&#39;s not &#39;kid food&#39;, it&#39;s regular adult menu items sized for kids. I dig that because I feel that at a lot of places the food from the kids menu isn&#39;t up to par with the rest of the menu. 

Cucumber Moscow Mules are a fun twist on a popular favorite, and their pretzels, hot wings, soups and salads have always been a hit with whoever we go with. 

It&#39;s generally pretty easy to get some reservations quickly though opentable. Sometimes we&#39;ll make some last minute reservations before leaving the house so we don&#39;t have to wait in line when we get there. I would say that Granite City is comparable to the local Stonewood Ale house, it just depends on what you&#39;re in the mood for. 

Also, besides the women&#39;s room and the men&#39;s room there is a family bathroom here which is pretty sweet if you have little ones and don&#39;t enjoy cramming multiple little people into a stall like it&#39;s a clown car."

This is a chain, so don&#39;t think this is something that sprang up organically in Schaumburg.

Breezed in with a 5:30 reservation on a Saturday.

I ordered their Batch 1000 Double IPA. It was correctly served in a snifter. That&#39;s about the best part of this completely forgettable and simply wrong taste profile for a Double IPA. Not particularly good.

Our server, Richard, was courteous and attentive. Since he knew I ordered a Double IPA, he brought over a sample of their American Pale Ale. That was worse than the Batch 1000. It tasted like colored water to me.

I had their basic hamburger. It was decent. I&#39;ve had better. Their fries are kinda rubbery, which was disappointing. 

My wife had their sea scallops. The bite I had was good, albeit with a somewhat bland risotto sauce.

Our son had a Kraft mac and cheese...with no side! C&#39;mon...at least give him a choice of french fries, veggies or fruit!

Best thing? The desserts. We ordered the chocolate layer cake which was very good and their &#34;lemonade&#34; cake (stupid name for a lemon cake) with lemon sorbet on the side. That was also good.

Overall, they need to improve their beer...tweak their food a bit and they&#39;ll be fine.

Decor is definitely nice, a good place to have a special meal or catch up with friends over beers.  

Server was very friendly and knew the menu.   She suggested we try the always good pot roast with beer gravy that she could literally drink.  

Pot roast was underwhelming as it was dry, and the sides of roasted vegetables carrots parsnips actually were burnt in the broiler. I requested additional gravy since there was so little on the plate.. after drowning the pot roast, it became respectable again. 

Flat bread was quite yummy though.   We had the maple peppered bacon with garlic aioli, which was a splendid combination to my taste buds.   wash it down with one of the light pilsner style beers they have.  

I&#39;ve passed this restaurant several times and wanted to check it out because of the lovely blend of decor and beer centric menu.  However I was underwhelmed and quite disappointed that the entire experience was not up to the anticipation. The decor, service was great. But how could a respectable kitchen serve something that&#39;s burnt?  I&#39;ll be hesitant to return again.

So the fact that this was a brewery was somewhat lost on me. I can&#39;t really comment on their food either. The salad, grilled chicken Caesar, was good but just a salad.

Here is what I can comment on. It&#39;s just another friggin brewery/restaurant. Seems like this is the thing lately and they all just seem the same to me. For the most part, they&#39;re always quite loud and quite busy. Not a bad place to stop and have beers and eat but again, they are all just carbon copies of each other, in my opinion.  The biggest problem with these places is that there is nothing memorable about them. Typically nothing sets one apart from the other. Granite City does not break that trend.

The service was good, so nothing to complain about there.

Would I go back? I guess I would but I&#39;m not going to go out of my way for it. If I was in the area or if somebody suggested going I would go. But it likely would not be the first thing to come to my mind."

Food.  Not so good.  First we had the soup of the day, Clam Chowder.  It was the consistency of wallpaper paste, had lumps of probably flour and COLD.  They both went back.   Then main course.  I had pulled pork over a &#34;roasted corn jalapeno&#34; waffle.  The waffle had neither the taste of roasted corn or jalapenos, more like a thawed out Eggo.  The pulled pork was pretty good, but they spoiled it by dumping some generic COLD barbecue sauce on it.  My date had the chicken with potatoes.  The chicken was generic grilled chicken of no particular flavor.  She said the potatoes were good however.   So overall the food was a miss.

Drinks.  Beer was good, not great...good.   Some of the cocktails on the other hand were excellent.  Cosmo and a &#34;blood orange bourbon sour&#34; were very good.

Service.  Our waitress was either new, on something or just untrained.  She had to ask everything three times.  Had to be reminded about the simplest things.  And acted like bring water glasses to the table was rocket science.  The staff seemed to be constantly frantic and running around.  Not a image of efficiency.

So overall.  Skip the food.  Have drinks and maybe some snacks and make sure the waitress writes everything down so you don&#39;t have to say it three times."

LIKES
*The decor was nice and the atmosphere was warm/slightly upscale for a bar/brewery type of restaurant

DISLIKES
*Our food was barely lukewarm and it arrived too quickly after placing our orders which made us skeptical of how fresh it was.
*The food was not impressive.  I had the bison short ribs and it was supposed to be tender...instead it was extremely dry and the portions weren&#39;t very big.  My friend had the grilled chicken and asparagus linguini which was very bland.  
*Our waitress wasn&#39;t unfriendly per se but she wasn&#39;t too personable.  When I mentioned that my food was dry and I just wanted to let her know, she told me I could go online to some link and comment on my dining experience there....um ok?
*My friend had the &#34;juicy watermelon martini&#34; and it was too sweet for her taste and they were a little stingy on the alcohol.

Overall my experience here wasn&#39;t the best.  We had to wait 30+ minutes to be seated but given that it was a Saturday and they haven&#39;t been open for too long, I understand that they would be busy.  I know they&#39;re new so I&#39;ll cut them some slack and hope they improve their food and service.  I may give them another chance during happy hour but I&#39;m not sure Granite City will be a place I frequent often."

However, this place needs work on their service. Each time we&#39;ve visited, service was slow and we had to ask several times for water or to get our order right. The tasty food is what has brought us back, despite the service and even getting a menu or table that was sticky and not properly cleaned. I love the ahi tuna crisp appetizer and spiraled veggies side."

I&#39;m not sure if they remembered the right place or not but I don&#39;t understand the hype at all.

This is your typically bar/restaurant/sort of brewery with some good drink specials and amazingly average food. 

At this point I&#39;ve tried the bacon burger from here and it was very ok. Not terrible but nothing stood out. When they had it, I tried their pulled pork on a waffle. Let me tell you, it was smart that got rid of it because that sucked. 

I will probably eat here again with friends but only because they wanted to come here. 

There&#39;s so many better options around here, just move along."

I liked how they had a lot of options for food(pasta, salad, burgers, steak, sandwiches, seafood). I ordered the pulled pork on a waffle sandwich and my friend ordered a pasta dish and we both enjoyed our dishes. It was a noisy and made it hard to talk but I expected it since it was a Friday night and there was also a large birthday group near us. Our server was focused on us and helpful and even after paying, we never felt rushed to leave.

We read some of the Yelp reviews and opted to try Granite City in Schaumburg. We arrived at 6:30 on a Sunday night and were seated right away. It took a few minutes before anyone came by the table. We really didn&#39;t notice time had passed - we were seated in front of the fireplace and were enjoying watching the flames.

A server approached and asked if anyone had greeted us yet. They hadn&#39;t, so she brought us menus, told us about the special meals and drinks. We ordered some of the Double IPA and she brought it right away. She must have said something to the server who was working our table because from that point, she handled us.

First, the beer. My son and I both tried the Double IPA and the Oatmeal Stout. Both were excellent. The IPA had the bitterness and bite you would expect, and the you could taste coffee and chocolate in the stout - it was also very creamy.

Onto the food - we had an order of wings to start - 3 Mango Habanero and 3 Old Bay Spice. One thing I can&#39;t stand about wings in restaurants is they tend to be undercooked. But not these - they were perfect. The Mango wings could have been hotter, but the Old Bay wings were a real treat. I never would have thought to put Old Bay on wings.

For dinner I had the Bison Burger with sweet potato tots, my wife had the Asian Chicken Salad and my son had the Meatloaf. I got try all of them and they were each fantastic in their own ways. The salad was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. The meatload was served on a bed of green beans which in turn were on a crustini. On top of the meatloaf was a large serving of mashed potatoes and onion straws. 

But, the Bison Burger was truly outstanding. Typically, Bison is overcooked to the point of it being dry. Not here - it was cooked just right and was juicy and delicious. The sweet potato tots had all of the flavor of sweet potatoes in the crunchy texture of tots.

Our server was personable and friendly and made us feel welcome. We plan to make this a regular stop on our meal circuit!"

Atmosphere is nice and it&#39;s a fairly nice size family type restaurant. They have a decent variety for their menu. Service is an okay pace, sometimes a bit slow. As far as servers, I&#39;ve had some excellent ones. LOVELOVELOVE Misty. Shes probably out fav, she is super nice and funny. We&#39;ve also had Raymond who was great too. Thomas the bartender is good as as well, very charming. I guess what disappoints us the most is the overall quality of food. The first few visits the food temperature was never hot, including soup. It was always cool or room temperature. Taste didn&#39;t seem worth the price. I will say one of my friends recommends the bruschetta salad the first time she had it. But she couldn&#39;t the second. I thought the Asian chicken salad was decent and the shrimp tacos were pretty good but definitely use the lime. My favorite will always be Del Seoul in the city so I&#39;m a bit biased.
Anyways food is mediocre but service is great. I&#39;ve had friends who&#39;ve tried some of the beers and enjoyed them. But for me, since I don&#39;t drink I can&#39;t comment!"

I was in the mood for a *good* burger for lunch, and remembered that the Granite City I used to visit in another state had a great lunch-sized roadhouse burger.  So I popped in here in the middle of a lunch-hour torrential downpour, lunch for one.

I got seated and greeted by an appropriately friendly server and got my menu.  My first let down was that the lunch menu now has no burgers on it at all.  And it just wasn&#39;t a pasta or wrap kind of day. *sigh*  So I flipped over to the main menu and decided to commit to a full-sized burger.  The waitress let me know that they had sweet potato tots as a side option these days, and I was all for it.

My gigantic burger (1/3 pound, I think. Ooof.) came out correctly medium rare, but a little too loosely packed to hold together at that temperature.  It became a pretty quick battle of keeping the pieces together as the sauce dissolved the bun and the patty really wanted to become a sloppy joe in its next life.  The sweet potato tots were room temperature and mushy, and had an overly-sweet marshmallow/powdered sugar flavor of some kind in them. (I really prefer my sweet potato things to just be sweet potato flavored because ain&#39;t nothing better than salt, garlic salt, or seasoned salt on a pile of sweet potato fries!)  She did refresh my Dr Pepper without any asking, which was nice.

And then there was the painful part, the $19 bill.  That hadn&#39;t really been what I had in mind when I wanted a burger for lunch, but that&#39;s how the dinner menu rolls."

Is it because we didn&#39;t order alcohol and therefore the check total is lower? Is it because we&#39;re judged by our appearance? Is the staff here just that miserable or overworked or thinly spread? Boggles the mind. 

We weren&#39;t told about the $5 flatbread special when our server had the table directly next to us and told them,.. Because they were special enough for ordering flatbread? 

The 2 stars are because: 
1) The food is good enough to come back despite the service, sadly. Not amazing but still good enough. The flatbreads are thin and crispy and flavorful, granted it&#39;s the first place I&#39;ve ever had a flatbread and maybe I could find a place with the same or better with better service... 
2) This second visit the manager Mike was kind enough to notice our helpless stares .. Having waited 20 minutes after being seated, and he finally took our order himself. When receiving our food, the waitress .. I&#39;m tasteful and won&#39;t mention her name.. Seemed disgruntled at us. Did she get in trouble and blame us? She was absentee for the rest of our visit. Chatting with staff. Seemingly avoiding us. Not doing work. We got fries that came with a bacon ketchup and when I asked for ketchup she snapped &#34; regular ketchup ?&#34; Back at me like .. How dare I ask?! :/ It took at least 15 minutes past the time we were ready to get our check to receive it. And we finally got it another 10-15 after asking. The place has business but by no means packed to the brim. Inside dining room was maybe 1/3 full. 

Oh Granite City. Taking your customers for .. Granite?"

It&#39;s definitely a favorite in the area. They have a great diverse menu and the service is phenomenal. Today we had Aidan serving us, and this guy just went above and beyond what I typically expect out of any server.  Aside from the superb service, he took the time to write what I ordered on my to-go box, and even dated it. Who does that!? It&#39;s those small, attention to detail kind of things that go a long way. Ask for Aidan!

They have a quick, affordable lunch menu, and their food quality is just exceptional.  For lunch, i&#39;ve tried their Pepperoni Flat Bread, Cajun Pasta, Avocado Chicken Wrap, and their Buffalo Chicken Wrap, all with a side salad, or french fries. All good, must-have choices, with more than decent portions!

Their beer and drinks are also great. I&#39;m a huge fan of their Batch 1000 (Double IPA), even if it&#39;s the only one never on special. GC is spacious, and the atmosphere is great. They even have a private space available for events, and out door seating.

Highly recommended!"

The food we had was okay, we ordered the charcuterie platter for an appetizer which had a nice selection of cheeses but not great on the meat.

Its hilarious though, there is a Granite City by my work and I cannot see it from the road so I instantly thought it was a warehouse for Granite Counter tops.  Then, when we saw the restaurant by Woodfield I was gladly mistaken.  

Came here for a dinner date with a bunch of friends.  We started off with a couple of flatbreads, calamari, and some kind of cheese dip that I cannot remember (but it was super yummy).  All of the appetizers were very tasty, I really like the BBQ chicken flatbread and the calamari -- it was Asian inspired, so it had a sweet heat.

Everybody seemed please with their dinner selections; I heavily enjoyed my Asian Chicken Salad along with my Blueberry Mint Fauxtail.  I liked that they had a separate section on the drink menu for Fauxtails.  I mean this prego loves her Kiddie Cocktails, but its always embarrassing ordering it at a nice restaurant.  

Service was slow here and there, but they were insanely busy for a Thursday night.  Prices are comparable to most burg establishments."

I ordered a Bruschetta Salad and couldn&#39;t rave about it enough!! This weekend, my experience was not nearly as great. I ordered the Steak Salad which was, actually fairly tasty, and my husband ordered Pasta Primavera... but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that it took almost an hour for us to get our food. We sat at a booth in the bar area and barely saw our waiter. The restaurant wasn&#39;t even busy! The Bears game was on - was the entire staff in the back watching the game or something? Were they understaffed? Who knows. I felt like the people sitting around us were also waiting for their food. My husband and I were just staring at each other in hunger. Another problem: My beer glass was so dirty, it had a thick white foam crud all around the top of the glass. So thick and solid that my nail couldn&#39;t even scrape it. Totally nasty.

i&#39;m a little too obsessed with the crispy shrimp tacos and therefore have not explored other menu options. that said, the shrimp tacos are glorious. the key lies in the flavor and texture profile of the shrimp and the Santa Fe cream. 

I did try a faux tail - the blueberry mint lemonade. it was rather unimpressive. it merely tasted like blueberries + lemonade, as the mint was not muddled enough. it was essentially like drinking two separate beverages, rather than a mixed drink. 

the reason this review is not five out of five stars is because of our waitress. she was a bit aloof and not knowledgeable about the menu. she was unable to provide adequate answers to simple questions."

Some friends and I decided to check this place out, since it just opened. My expectation was that this was just going to be on par with RAM, which I&#39;m not a huge fan of, so I didn&#39;t really get my hopes up. As soon as we sat down and ordered our beers, I was frantically Googling and Yelping. Since this place is new, it only has a handful of reviews. I found out this place started in St. Cloud, MN, so I searched for the location there, which still only had about 130 reviews. None of the buzz items really matched, so I really didn&#39;t know what to try. So...we ordered a bunch!

PB&amp;J WINGS
This has to be the most exotic thing we tried. Who thinks to put PB&amp;J on wings? Now, I absolutely love peanut butter, and love PB&amp;J (see: Little Goat - Fat Elvis Waffles and DMK Burger Bar - PB Shake), but this is a bad idea. I tried to figure out what this would taste like, and everything I could come up with tasted bad or weird. Then I tried them, and sure enough, they&#39;re weird! 

The boneless chicken is great! It&#39;s got some crunchy parts, not as crunchy as BW3, but still good, and the seasoning on the chicken was great! I&#39;m sure almost any other sauce could probably benefit from this. Peanut butter? Nope! Plus, the jelly tasted more like Chambord liqueur than actual jelly. 

My guess is that somebody tried chicken satay and said, &#34;OMG! I bet this would work on wings!&#34; And while that statement might be true, chicken satay with peanut sauce is completely different than PB&amp;J! That stuff has lime, fish sauce, and ginger added to it to give it its flavor, in addition to the peanut butter. Even without the jelly, this still wouldn&#39;t work. Basically, the boneless chicken flavors and the peanut butter flavors were completely at odds with each other creating a cacophony of one trying to outdo the other.

Swing &amp; a miss! I hope this is not a taste of things to come!

BRUSCHETTA SALAD
I love bruschetta, mainly because the tomatoes are so good! This is like bruschetta on steroids and ephedrine! The salad is probably 1/2 tomatoes (some sliced, some diced) and the rest is a little bit of spring mix, black olives, chicken, and what&#39;s not seen is the basalmic, basil, garlic, and olive oil spread throughout. 

Also, there are 6-8 pieces of toasted baguette whose texture was perfect! Crunchy crust, crispy/toasty middle, and chewy in the very center, while still being a little crispy. All are brilliantly baptized (not the Baptists&#39; way) with olive oil and maybe rubbed with some garlic. You have to resist the temptation to just eat it by itself. The tomatoes are all so incredibly flavorful and they&#39;re carefully infused with the balsamic vinegar, that eating them alone would be gratifying. All the flavors together, though, make an incredible symphony! ...except that one oddball...black olives. I think I&#39;ll order without next time.

CHEDDAR SOUP
Basically a beer cheese soup, but not very beer-y, which is actually a good thing! Beer is great, but when it spills into my soup, it&#39;s not great. The soup is cheesy, obviously, but perfect thickness, and not acidic, like some have been in the past. Very refreshing.

SHRIMP TACOS
This was why one of my friends was wanting to come here. He said the shrimp tacos were to die for! To be honest, when I get a recommendation like that, I&#39;m 1/2 excited and 1/2 skeptical. I&#39;ve been disappointed many times. 

As soon as I touched the tortilla, I was worried. It felt cold and cheap, like Taco Bell&#39;s soft shell.  Then I took a bite. 

I don&#39;t know how to explain this to you, but just talking texture, the bite was engineered for perfection! There&#39;s lettuce, pico de gallo, and crispy shrimp, in a cheap soft shell taco. Even just the sound of your teeth going through all those crispy/crunchy/meaty layers was so satisfying; even more so the feel! The soft tortilla actually helps accentuate this by giving you the soft layer first, right before clamping into all the crunchy stuff. Makes you wonder...cosmic accident or intelligent design?

Then the flavors begin to excite the senses. The Asian glaze brings you this beautiful sweet &amp; salty bite with probably soy, garlic, maybe plum sauce, and then chili, which starts to build a kick. Moving toward the next bite, you pick up the savory shrimp flavors with the breading, and the heat builds, but then cilantro comes in with its flavor of freshness, which begin to cool off the outskirts, and then you finally get the cool, buttery, Santa Fe Cream sauce blanket to put out the flame, and heal the tongue...in preparation for the next bite!

You do have the option of avocado, and honestly, I felt like it was a side grade. It dulled the peaks &amp; valleys a bit, but it also added a nice extra buttery flavor to the whole bite. I&#39;d probably do without next time.

Their Bloody Marys are awesomely delicious.  I tend to always get a steak and salad and have yet to be disappointed.   Since I&#39;m a low-carber, I usually substitute a veggy for my carb sides, I never have a problem doing that here (some places don&#39;t like to substitute).

I ordered a cup of the baked French Onion soup and the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and my husband ordered the fish and chips. The soup was delicious and I liked the wrap although next time I will ask for no celery. Our waitress could have stopped by our table more often but other staff stepped in when they saw we needed drink refills. I&#39;m a little disappointed that their kitchen closes around 10 and only serves apps after that. Otherwise this is a solid addition to the restaurants around the mall.

I went last night with a couple of coworkers for some happy hour brews and bites to try things out. From what I understand, they just opened this week so I&#39;m going to go easy on them. :) When we walked in, millions of hosts greeting us and slightly clunky lead in to get us seated. My thought on this is they just opened so this will be ironed out. Everyone working was very nice but there were tons and tons of workers walking around looking for something to do. Plus when we checked in with the hosts, they made us feel like we should have had a reservation...even though we arrived at 4:45 and it was practically empty. Again, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just an opening thing of getting everyone used to working so they must each only have like two tables and just not have enough to do. All these small service things are completely forgiven in an opening week.

I think Granite City is a very viable option for happy hour after work. From 3-6pm they have some great food specials and each day Monday to Friday there is some kind of drink special. Yesterday the drink special was $3 pints of their in house beers. I&#39;ve been to another Granite City location before so I was familiar with their beers. I&#39;m not head over heels with any however they are all solid options ranging from 2.5-3.5 bottlecaps for me on Untappd. 

We tried many food options between the three of us that were on their special Happy Hour menu which included:
+Pepperoni Flatbread $5 - Loved this. It was just like a slightly healthier pizza. Yum!
+Potato Skins $5 - 5 came in an order and they were pretty tasty. A bit skinnier than those I&#39;ve seen at other places and loaded with tomatoes on top. I moved the tomatoes off the top and chowed down on the bad boys. 
+PB&amp;J Wings $5 - With such a unique flavor on the menu, how could we not order these!? You can order the wings either with or without bones which is fabulous they have a boneless option. The order comes with 5 in a bowl &amp; either ranch or bleu cheese. Now, the PB&amp;J in particular, well, they were interesting. They really did taste like peanut butter with a dash of jelly on top. These weren&#39;t our favorite of the night but they are definitely something unique to try.
+Orange Hoisin Wings $5 - I really liked these and they were probably my favorite of the wing flavors. They had that Chinese food flare with quite a kick to them. 
+Old Bay Dry Rub Wings $5 - My coworkers liked these the best. They had a nice spice to them and were enjoyed by all.
+Pulled Pork Tacos $5 - These came in a set of 3. I thought they were just okay, a little dry and probably not something I&#39;d get again unless I really had that pork craving.

Aside from what we tried, they had a lot on their regular menu that looked quite good but things seemed a bit pricey. They do have lunch time deals for $9 so I&#39;m sure I will bring my coworkers over here to give it a go at lunch. 

Overall, I&#39;m happy to see Granite City join the neighborhood and think it&#39;s a great option for happy hour after work. Love the chill yet classy atmosphere of the place and I&#39;m sure any service kinks will be worked out in time. Solid beers, solid food and looking forward to trying more!"

My first visit I was excited and my wife and I sat outside late in the summer. The server was very friendly but when I went to order my beer he said they were out of it for the season, so I asked for another. He came back and said they were out of that as well and when I pointed to another he smiled in a coy manner and I asked, &#34;What do you have?!&#34; He brought me a sample of his favorite which was no where near any of the beers I had expressed interest. 

We returned this past Sunday (11/29) with all my in laws and our new son (2 months old) and we came in at 3:45. Everything seemed to be going well till 30 minutes after we ordered the server stopped by to say it shouldn&#39;t be much longer....I&#39;ve been to enough restaurants to know that is not a good sign. As she walked away we flagged her down looking for the soup my wife ordered. Clearly that had not been started since it was French Onion and another 5 minutes for that to arrive. The soup came and went and finally after an hour we go our food. 

My mother-in-law was surprisingly calm said, &#34;Should it really take this long?&#34; and the server was quick to say it was not her fault and that it was the kitchen&#39;s fault, their were only 2 cooks she explained. She said she could have sent the manager but we just wanted to get out of there. The better route would have sent the manager especially since the place was quiet in the 4 O&#39;Clock hour on a Sunday. Well after that interaction we all (6) ate as quickly as we could and declined dessert and left as quickly as possible with no intention of returning especially with all the other option in the immediate vicinity. 

I will note, the food is fine and the beer isn&#39;t too bad. Coleslaw on a Reuben ceases to be a Reuben. The place is clan and fresh and could be better if they want."

I&#39;m so happy that we listened. White Chocolate restaurant used to be our place to go when I didn&#39;t feel like cooking (and needed to relax). Not any more. We actually stopped going to Whole Foods to grab lunches too - this place is about 30-50% more expensive than what we end up paying for buffet food at Whole Foods, but you get more food and the amazing service.

We&#39;ve been to GC about 8 times by now - we always come with our 5 year old twins, and we all love it, because:
- the food tastes good. We tried many things from the menu, and none of them disappoint.
- it is not overpriced. You can get good sized steak for under $20 that tastes better than some of the $50+ steaks that I had in the past in other places. I make myself try other options from the menu, but that steak just rocks!
- kids meals are amazing and priced reasonably
- desserts are excellent! You can choose three not-that-mini deserts for less than $6. This is crazy - Whole Foods next door charges you more for a piece of a cake that has been lying on the shelf for who knows how long.
- the design is modern and clean
- staff is welcoming
- we never had to wait for the table, but then we usually come during the week, or lunchtime
- we got some coupons once for free kids meals
- drinks are good (I swear that Honeybee drink help me with my cold ;D )

The only negative experience that we had at GC was when we were waiting for our friends in the lobby, and my kid sat on one of the benches and then leaned backwards and hit his head really hard on the stone wall... He had a big bruise for couple of day after that - he recalls this every time we enter the restaurant, so it must have been bad. I can&#39;t really complain about things like that, but if this happened to my kid, it can happen to someone else too. I would replace these benches with something with back support for safety."

My lunch companions ordered the fish and chips and their bbq chicken wings (appetizer) and both enjoyed their meals. One raved about the ranch dressing (all ranch ain&#39;t the same everywhere, yo)!

I&#39;ve been here a bunch of times since they&#39;ve opened over the summer. Every time I go, I&#39;m left a little more disappointed or unsatisfied- still trying to decide which one is it. 

Granite City is your standard restaurant that brews it&#39;s own beer, just dressed up with nicer decor and ambiance. This restaurant is huge and would be good for parties and business lunches. 

Fully stocked bar, with a few different house brews that are pretty tasty and unique. Food overall is meh and if anything over-salted or overly sweet. 

Best deals: Lunch and Brunch. Both options are priced fairly and you get A LOT of food (brunch is a buffet). 

Favorite item is the Asian salad, I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s addicting. They serve it at brunch and you can order it as a side option. It&#39;s crisp and light and really good. 

Flatbreads are ok- toppings are lacking and not as crispy as a flatbread should be.
Ahi- Tuna Wontons are pretty fresh and have a good flavor. More on the sweet side. 
Big Show Burger, more sweet than anything. Crispy onion strings are anything but crispy.
Prime Rib is included in the brunch and it&#39;s good. Juicy, flavorful and they don&#39;t skimp out on the portions. 

Not a place that I will frequent that often. I would go here for brunch and business lunches since they have something for everyone. It&#39;ll be interesting to see how this place will be in a year."

The beer itself is pretty good, but the food is average and each time I&#39;ve been the service was terrible.  I can&#39;t stand a restaurant where the waitstaff acts like their customers are in the way.  Each time we asked for something, the server ran from the table before we could ask for anything else.  As a result each time we got something we had to ask for the next - if we could catch them in time.

Our server Carl was super friendly and very attentive, he made some beer suggestions for my friend and he loved the beers he tried. Of course I couldn&#39;t decide what to get and he made a few suggestions and I&#39;m glad I listened!

My friend ordered a burger (not sure what it was) but he loved it, cooked the way he liked it and he didn&#39;t finish it all! Huge burger! I on the other hand decided to go with the Cajun Chicken Pasta and it was amazing! So much flavor and pretty large portion. 

Their cocktails are so good! I loved the crazy monkey or something like that haha very fresh and sweet!

Overall the place is big and everyone was quite friendly but our server definitely made it a great night thank you Carl! Definitely recommend this place."

A perfect word to describe the lunch me and my 3 co-workers had here yesterday. The place was completely packed at lunch, so, naturally, our food took quite a while to come out. Our waitress was good, though. However, the acoustics in here are terrible, and when it&#39;s crowded you literally have to shout at each other across the table. 3 of us got wraps and fries, one got a burger. When the food showed up it looked like it&#39;d been sitting under a hot lamp for 15 minutes. Everything was really salty. We all left agreeing we&#39;d never go back. Maybe other items are great, but not worth trying for me."

I usually get a pulled chicken sandwich. Many times while I&#39;ve ate my sandwich Ive bitten into a gummy part of the the chicken that was put in my sandwich. It grosses me out, I think its cartilage. The overall chicken quality seems to have gone down too, theres too much dark meat. The bun in which they put the pulled chicken in is always changing, the last time I went i hated it. It was so dry it wasnt even absorbing the BBQ sauce, I threw the bread away.

The fries are the only thing that I have never had a problem with, but that doesnt say alot because just any place can make great fries and cheaper too, like McDonalds.

I think I may have just gone there for my last time. Ill go less than a minute down the road and go to Avantis, Ive never had a bad meal there."

While I may have worked AROUND THE CORNER from this local spot, I never actually ate here. To my understanding, the current owners have only been there a few years so it&#39;s possible that this building was owned by another restaurateur when I still worked nearby.

The exterior is not impressive and reminds me of an old Pizza Hut, which it may have been a million years ago. Before I go on, I have to tell you not to allow the look of the outside deter you from entering for lunch or dinner. It may not be the fanciest place but it&#39;s super adorable inside. It reminds me of Famous Dave&#39;s on the interior but a little more casual and NOT A CHAIN (which you should know by now, are my least favorite places to go)

We arrived between lunch and dinner so it was a little quiet upon our arrival but I appreciated the fact that during their &#34;down time&#34;, from what I could tell, the employees were Windex-ing the doors and windows and cleaning tables during this lull in their day. That shows me management cares...Check!

Greeted by a lovely woman upon entering, we were welcomed to pick a table of our choice. We grabbed a spot in the corner near a TV for whatever sporting event was taking place above my head for my spouse&#39;s entertainment. While I sipped my water from my foam cup, debating over the many options on the menu, I informed our server we had never been here before and I needed some guidance of suggestions.

She suggested the Boss Dinner (kinda a sampler of sorts) which is your choice of 3 meats and a side with a salad. I chose the pulled smoked chicken, smoked brisket and pulled pork. My husband was craving beef so he selected the smoked brisket with fries. The meats were all fantastic. Famous Daves, eat your heart out! Everything was tender and fresh. The salad was nothing special and the sides were average but their meats are delicious!!

Who knew I liked smoked meat so much!?! Since our last visit, my husband has mentioned T-Bob&#39;s several times and wants to go back soon! He doesn&#39;t ask for much, so needless to say, we&#39;ll be back soon!"

The &#34;real&#34; meat products look good and ok. 
One other problem is the cheap hamburger buns used- that alone make me not want to come back.
The iceberg lettuce- come on that&#39;s NOT a salad.

I couldn&#39;t remember why I stopped going, and today&#39;s visit reminded me why.

I ordered a variety of things to try, and the girl behind the counter was very friendly and nice. The owner/manager? Eh. Kind of rude when it came to explaining to us the two BBQ sauces they carry. 

Anyhow, I ordered the boss dinner with brisket, shredded chicken and pulled pork. We also ordered chili, cole slaw, corn muffins, baked beans, and Mac n cheese. Pulled pork was ok, but I had a large piece of cartilage in my serving---gross. Shredded chicken was decent...I like the sweet/hot sauce. The vinegar/tomato sauce tastes odd. Cole slaw was bland...needed acidity and/or sweetness. Baked beans were the best thing I had, but they tasted like they came out of a can. The chili was packed with stuff, and not in a good way. The taste was weird. The corn muffin was so dry I couldn&#39;t eat it. The brisket was very fatty. It was so fatty I gave it to my dog. The mac n cheese was decent tasting, creamy and baked. 

It&#39;s pretty pricey too for the small portions. I will not be going back."

The decor is nothing fancy, but it&#39;s clean and comfortable. The menu is fairly extensive and has some unusual items such as smoked meatloaf. This is the kind of place where you order &amp; pay at the window and they bring your food to your table when it&#39;s ready.

I got the pulled pork sandwich with the sweet &amp; heat sauce, french fries &amp; cole slaw. The pork was delicious, tender with a light smoke flavor and a few pieces of tasty bark, although I would have liked a bit more sauce. At first I was afraid that the soft bun would fall apart but I found it to be perfect - soft enough to easily bite and chew, yet firm enough to hold together nicely. The bun also had good flavor that didn&#39;t compete with the meat.

The fries were nicely browned, but not particularly flavorful (aside from the small kinda burnt ones that I love). The cole slaw cup was tiny but flavorful with a nice vinegar &amp; horseradish taste. The fountain drinks are bottomless, which is good as the styrofoam cup was on the small side.

So for the sandwich, fries, slaw and drink I paid a total of $10.67, which I consider quite reasonable for this type of food. I&#39;ll be back!"

I&#39;ve enjoyed their meats &amp; spicy sauce a couple of times, and probably will again.  Their meat is decent, and when the company orders we get a ton of sauce on the side, which is good.

This review is based on ordering carry-out for one.  I ordered the brisket, since I&#39;ve enjoyed it before, but the portion size was tiny, and about a third of it was fat.  Plus there wasn&#39;t enough sauce.

I chose the sweet potato fries for my side.  They were literally still cold, and very wet.  They had a strange, inedible odor.  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, and I would say it was an honest mistake, but you know when you get the feeling that the person behind the counter doesn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patoot?  I don&#39;t know, maybe she was tired.

I ordered the cornbread.  Big mistake.  It&#39;s sitting on display in individual plastic bags, who knows for how long.  Well I do.  A long time.  It was basically a powder it was so dry, and it did not smell like something I would eat.  And I love cornbread!

With a drink I paid over $14, and I was still hungry because I only ate about 3 ounces of brisket.  I won&#39;t be back, though like I said I&#39;ll probably eat it again when the boss orders it."

So I&#39;m no expert. Big freaking deal. I&#39;m willing to learn.

As far as T Bobs goes, I have zero complaints and only a minor suggestion, maybe two.

The outside looks a bit uninspired and rather shifty. Nevertheless I&#39;m intrigued by the thought of real smoke and such.

It&#39;s taken about 3 months for me to get here but that&#39;s only because of mixed reviews.

So I tried the beef brisket sandwich. It was pretty good. Small but still not too small. The beef was sliced with a decent thickness and layered 3 or 4 deep. It was completely tender, juicy, smokey, sweet, and delicious.

The roll was better than a hamburger bun but almost not enough for this type of stuffing but it did hold up through the end.

Then the whole baked sweet potato on the side was steaming and moist. They served some brown sugar and butter next to it.  Mmmmmmm.

A pickle chip and cole slaw rounded out the plate as well as my palate. Satisfaction, indeed. 

The sauce had no tang other than maybe that of a 9-volt battery after a year in the smoke detector. It was tangy and sweet with just the right amount on the sandwich to bring out the BBQ- not enough to drown the meet- but plenty. Good. 

For (Yelp! won&#39;t let me use a &#34;less-than&#34; symbol?) less than $12 I left stuffed. I don&#39;t drink sodas and they don&#39;t serve beer but it is BYOB.

SO IM COMING BACK WITH THE FAMILY NEXT TIME. And I am bring my b. 

Oh, yeah. It&#39;s pretty nice inside. Clean and comfy. Blah blah. Lots of parking. Outdoor seating. Blah blah. Drive through, too. Blah blah. 

Very nice hostess/cashier. Very friendly and helpful.

Gotta try the beans, corn bread, chili, pulled pork....

On the outside, my first thoughts were that the restaurant looked old and shady.  But the inside was very cozy and quaint - great seating and very clean.  I split a 10 wing/10 rib tip/4 hot link meal with one friend and we were shocked at how much food came for the price.  We didn&#39;t even manage to eat half and had to put the rest in a box, and I&#39;m a 6 foot 200 lb meat-eating machine.  Hot links were absolutely delicious, great flavor and very juicy.  Wings were also excellent, great sauce and the meat was perfect.  Rib tips were probably the weakest of the three but still pretty good in my opinion.  Two of my friends ordered the catfish and they thought it was great, I tried some mac and cheese and it was awesome as well.  Food puts them at 4 stars but the service gets them the 5th as they were very friendly to us.  Joked with us when we asked for the box to take home 60% of our order, came around and asked us if we wanted refills, said thanks and have a good weekend as we left, etc.

I will definitely be coming back here for lunch again!"

Our order was done pretty quick considering we were less than 5 minutes away from the restaurant. I love that you can pick up your take out from the drive through! 

I thought prices weren&#39;t too bad. We paid about $30 for a half rack of ribs and a burger with sides (that came with each order). With the ribs we got the Sweet Heat sauce, it was delicious and the ribs werent bad, not as tender as we like it but not bad. The fries were really cripsy and had a seasoning to it, pretty yummy. The ribs came with a salad, but again nothing special just lettuce and some tomatoes and onions. The burger wasnt anything special, the bbq sauce is really what made it tasty. It was really big, good enough for left overs. I ordered the sweet potato fries and was disappointed. They were really soggy and too sweet as if syrup was added to them. 

Over all food wasnt bad and price was pretty good. Its not a place I would be dying to go to, but would try again if I craved bbq and were in the area."

I&#39;ve eaten here many times over the past couple years and keep coming back. Here&#39;s why...

Excellent large menu with lots of smoked meats and a tasty vinegar-based sauce. Had the smoked corned beef today and it was delicious. The smoked meat loaf is good for something different. I&#39;ve tried many things on the menu and the best item is not listed regularly: THE SLOPPY BOB. It&#39;s a &#34;sloppy joe&#34; style sandwich made with pulled pork, brisket, and their two BBQ sauces combined. Ask for it.

The owner is a real character and he can come off a bit abrasive if you&#39;re too sensitive. Truth is he&#39;s just having fun.

The only reason I&#39;m holding back on 5 stars is because of a couple poor items on the menu. The catfish I had tasted too much of the oil it was cooked in, and the potato salad is bland. NOTE to owner: ADD SOME ZING TO IT. I dipped the potato salad in BBQ sauce and it was much better.

Other meats have been good here, ribs, pulled pork, brisket, etc.

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of au gratin potatoes. The sandwich needed more sauce in my opinion. The sandwich was just mundane, missing flavor and I felt the meat wasn&#39;t too fresh. The potatoes were pretty good but the Cole slaw was again, lacking flavor. Also, i paid almost 12 dollars for just a sandwich, small side, tiny side of coleslaw, and a drink and was expecting more from the meal but was disappointed with the lack of flavor.   I give them 2.5  stars for trying and the fact that the people were friendly but really I wouldn&#39;t eat here again. I would rather go to arbys."

The meat was very tender and the portion was ample. I had the Sweet &amp; Heat BBQ sauce on the side. It was a good sauce but it would be good to have a hotter sauce available as well. The potato salad was somewhat bland. It could use more celery and perhaps add some onion. The coleslaw was good, a little on the  tart side.
I consider Texas BBQ the gold standard so the pork could have been smoked a little more and some onions and jalapeños on the side would have been nice.
Overall a good BBQ meal and I will be back."

Having lived in the south and Kansas City, as well as Oakland, I have been spoiled. This place said they didn&#39;t offer combo plates for lunch. Why? And they are not alone in this, in Chicago. Why would you leave money on the table if you owned a barbecue place?  People want to try more than one kind of barbecue, and they will pay for it. Speaking of barbecue , the pulled chicken consists of slightly dry but fresh chunks of chicken with a little discernible smoke, slathered with annoyingly sweet sauce. The potato salad is fresh, but without distinction. Bland. Nice coleslaw, with lots of horseradish."

Meat loaf special came with 1 slice of meat loaf (huh?  who does that?) and an upgraded sweet potato that was NOT fresh.  The lone roll I got (they give you one tiny roll and wont give you another unless you BUY it) was also OLD.

You know its really smoked when you can smell the smoker before you walk in.

Extensive menu that includes your expected items at a bbq joint such as brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs, wings, tips as well as shrimp po boy, burger, rib tips, chicken, fried catfish, chix/rib combo skirt steak sandwich.

Sides:  Mac n cheese, beans, fries, sweet potato fries, baked sweet potato,new red potatoes, pasta salad, apples, corn bread, coleslaw, potato salad, and bbq spaghetti.

My meal was the brisket dinner.  For $10.50 comes with a generous amount of tasty brisket, choice of potato, salad and a roll (think a soft brown n serve). My sweet potato fries were soggy, I am not going to fault that on them as I dont know if they were soggy going into my to-go container or just got soggy on the ride home.

The brisket was moist, not fatty and thankfully not too salty.  Your sauce options are a heated/spicy or original tomato vinegar base.  i had the original on the side (monitoring my sugar intake) and it suited me fine, not too twangy with a nice smokey flavor. 

Partner had pulled pork sandwich (comes w potato, pickle, coleslaw), bun toasted, he found that the sandwich had as much meat as my dinner.  Pork was not too dry, coleslaw nothing special, perfectly cooked red potatoes.
For the two of us under $20.

 Then while we were waiting on our order, partner got an order of chili for next day lunch; the chili is definitely home made and appeared to have brisket (not ground beef) in it.

Clean interior with IBC 6 pack cartons serving as condiment holders on the tables.

I got a mini sweet potato pie (so much for watching my sugar) and they also have flan. The pie had a whipped consistency, not so much custard-y but the flavor was good.

I&#39;m happy to have a new business in the area, will return and try more items on the menu.  Eager to try the rib tips,skirt steak sandwich,  mac n cheese, (large) corn bread muffin.  
Their fountain is &#34;no coke, pepsi&#34;

They have M-F Blue plate specials:  (M-F order, Smoked burger, quarter chicken, smoked meat loaf, pot roast, fish).

They will start delivering in May.  Give &#39;em a try!
---------------------------
REVISTED:   If I based my review on this most recent (my 3rd visit) I would have never come back.  I am knocking off only one star because I will still go back for the brisket.

Tonight&#39;s to-go meal was terrible. I got the chick rib combo.  Unlike  the other reviewer whose ribs were horribly overdone, mine were sorely undercooked.  I mean so much so that if  we werent so exhausted from  the day, Id go back and present them to the owner.  Don&#39;t want to spend the gas money or time.  But I am so very disappointed at the time, money and enthusiasm that I have lost.

We ordered a family bucket of tips with sweet &#39;n spicy sauce and wings with sweet &#39;n spicy sauce... we were not disappointed!  While no one likes dry tips, my family is fond of tips that have a nice char on them and T-Bob&#39;s didn&#39;t disappoint!  The wings were also moist with a little, tiny char on the outside... worth it!  

The family bucket came with salad and potato and dinner rolls.  Decent deal considering the price... Unfortunately I cannot say that the sides were nearly as good.  We ordered some corn bread and baked beans too and I have to agree with another review which called the sides standard deli... while I enjoyed the potato salad, I think I could have gotten just as good at a grocery store, and the beans tasted like Bushes canned, even though there were pieces of bacon and onion... they weren&#39;t very impressive.  The corn bread did have jalopenos in it and my husband and son really enjoyed it.

The pulled pork is decent, and I know that bbq sandwiches are typically not cheap 
-but if you want to charge $7+ bucks for a sandwich it better be the best. 

It is clearly not. 

I found the sauce to be overly sweet, and the cole slaw didn&#39;t lend enough acidity to counter the sweetness.
 I found the brisket to be inconsistent, one visit it was soft but dry and over trimmed, and last night it was underdone and a bit chewy and over sauced.
All in all, perhaps they&#39;ll get better in time. I hope they do a reasonably priced combo plate and come away from all the bullshit filler like nuggets (from Aldi?) and fried wings...come on, if you&#39;re gonna do wings, at least have a smoked wing option.
How about cutting out the whole &#34;cafeteria service thing&#34;? the slaw in a side cup, the plastic butter tub, the fancy but mediocre pulled pork bread?

It barely makes the cut off for decent and really cause it&#39;s about the only bbq you can get nearby

Here&#39;s the breakdown of why it doesn&#39;t make the cut

1. Sausage: Tastes store bought, heavy on the salt which in turn over powers the smokiness a good sausage should have. Dry not succulent at all.

2. Chicken: Mine was cold, which is unacceptable in any place but especially a BBQ place

3. Brisket: Probably the best  out of all the meats. If I just got this it would probably put in a three category. Not 4 because it was a little on the fatty side and could be trimmed better.

4. No substitutions for Slaw. Now look I don&#39;t like slaw unless I make it myself or it&#39;s from a place I trust. So not being able to sub in for extra fries or mac and cheese is a downer. 

5. Everything was smother in sauce. The meat and the sauce should speak on their own and one should never compensate for the other. 

Alright so in summation stick with brisket it&#39;s probably your best bet. I didn&#39;t rate the pulled pork because I only had a small piece off a friends plate. 

It&#39;ll be hard for me to come back here based on my own assessment but it may happen when I&#39;m tired of the slim pickins&#39; in the Des Plaines area."

Got the tips, pulled pork &amp; brisket.  Not bad for the burbs.  The fries were good and hot.  I always ask for sauce on the side so I can control, and they had only 2 kinds of sauce at the time.  Gotta check again when I go back.  

Service was very good.  Fast, was greeted, checked on and said good-bye to upon leaving.  Sometimes that makes the difference in a person&#39;s decision to return:  Acknowledgement of your business and a pleasant atmos.

Will be back.  Wish they had more sauces.

FYI, though it appears that 3-stars is just so-so, it really is a good regular place to go to, which I plan on doing.  It&#39;s just that I grew up on Miller&#39;s Pub, go to Memphis every year and eat at Smoque and Hecky&#39;s all the time, it&#39;s just hard to give the same rating."

However, it should be noted that the food does not keep well, so it&#39;s in your best interest to dine-in.  I have carried food out twice, and each time I opened the Styrofoam containers the food is soggy and kind of gross.  I know this is going to sound crazy, but it&#39;s because they cook and serve quality food.  Once the food is cooked, it&#39;s immediately put into the containers piping hot.  The steam gets trapped and condenses on the food.  There&#39;s really no way around it; you&#39;re just gong to have to eat in, but it&#39;s well worth it."

The only negative is the cost of drinks and the size of the cup...they give you free refills, but you can easily need 2 refills through the course of a meal. The service is excellent though, so it never feels like a chore.

The beef brisket is average. Mine was a little dry and flavorless. Had to drown with sauce. Ahhh the sauce. The 2 varieties I had both tasted about the same. Both on the bland side. They give you little small plastic cups with sauce. They really need to put out the sauce in squeeze containers and label them. Chicken breast is a large chunky breast. It was ok but needs to be pounded thin and cooked better. Overall the place is friendly and just ok for food. If you want really good BBQ in the area stick to Sweet Baby Rays in Elk Grove

While not as amazing as the chopped beef brisket at Smoque, it is good and I would eat here again. I was able to sample the pulled pork and was not very impressed and would not order, imagine flavorless pork (someone could have told me it was chicken and I would have believed them). On an earlier visit I had their T-Bob burger and it was cooked perfectly, juicy and huge. I also had the home made potato salad which was very good. Based on the Brisket and Burger I would recommend this restaurant. The owner is a great guy and I hope this place does well and keeps getting better. I should bring him some brisket from Smoque to sample one day."

The sweet sauce is good with a wave of heat the sneaks up on you but is not overpowering.  

They serve a generous helping of both meat and fries.  I personally would love more sauce but they are always happy to give you more.

Definitely worth trying - you will not be sorry."

However, the bbq spaghetti was delicious! wonderful amount of sauce, the pulled pork was delicious, and on top of the spaghetti was great.

The chicken was good... still can taste it on my fingers. The fries so so; enjoyed the dinner roll.  The girl who brought the food to the table was delightful.

What I could not get past was when I asked politely if I could have something other than a salad with my dinner (it&#39;s included). Most BBQ joints are meat and twos... you pick your 2 sides with your meat.  Without hesitation or explanation the employee just responded &#34;No.&#34;  No explanation, no apology, nothing. Just a monotone &#34;no.&#34;

I am all about supporting local businesses, and I certainly don&#39;t enjoy the drive to Hickory River (which is quite tasty!), but that one syllable reply has left a bad taste in my mouth. I live nearby... I would have definitely come back to support them, but the lack of substitution on a side dish will ultimately keep me away."

I&#39;m not sure what oil they use for the fries, but it just doesn&#39;t work for me. They&#39;re not steak fries (a rib must) but crinkly ones with an off-taste. We ordered the sweet potato fries and they were burnt to a crisp. We purchased two salads, and they really substandard. 

The coleslaw and the bun were also pretty &#39;meh&#39; (I would be happier with a slice of white bread). My motto is if you can&#39;t offer something done well, then don&#39;t offer it. The staff are OK and the prices decent. 

The rib meat is good, but the sauces are either too sweet or too bitter (Carolina style)."

I asked for extra sauce because the pulled pork was a bit dry last time I ordered it.  The 2 sauce choices are both very tasty.  If your choice of potato is baked sweet potato they will add $1.  The sweet potato was huge but I wish they had told me about the added price.  I did not order the fried sweet potato again because the first time I did they were limp and seemed a bit raw.  My husband was not impressed with the shrimp po boy for the price.  
You will spend more here than at a regular take-out joint.  The quality is good so I guess that accounts for the higher prices."

Seriously? How about coleslaw? The sweet heat sauce has an overpowering spice in it. Had fries and so did my wife with her sandwich. I&#39;m guessing the oil from the fryer is seldom changed. They had a very strange aftertaste. My son had wings. Judging by how fast our order came and how hot these were makes me think microwave ? He also had mac and cheese for a side. Again, a  pre-portioned microwaved glob of zero flavor. Doesn&#39;t anybody taste anything here? The standards here are lacking. What a disappointment.

I grew up in Des Plaines, and my first job was at the old DQ. However, I have heard great reviews about this place from my other friends in the area. 

Reason why this place is great:
1- You walk in and you are greeted by a warm face, you are given time to look over the menu and you order. 
2- They bring out your meal in courses. I had a salad with mine and like any casual dining restaurant the salad is brought first, with real silverware and not plastic-ware. 
3. The young lady behind the counter came around and did a 2 bite-check back to make sure we were enjoying our meal, after she brought it to our booth. 
4. The food was great, and the fact they let me try both BBQ sauces before I made my decision really means, they are giving their customers an opportunity to branch out on their normal tastes. 
5. My meal was huge as was my Fiances. We both needed boxes to go for lunch the next day. The portion size compared to the price is a great fit. There is nowhere else you can get this much BBQ Style food in the area for this price. 
6. My table was prebused by the young lady who checked on us earlier. 

Overall great service, great good, very clean established! We will definitely be back!"

Cole slaw was ok. Most likely wont go there again. I dont know how this place is getting alot of 4 and 5 stars, it must be friends and family. Or people who havent had realy.

I was in the mood for ribs, and trying to think of a decent place to go. Smoque and L. Woods were farther than I wanted to deal with, and a search reminded me that I had noticed that this place existed the other day.    I ordered my food for takeout, but the place did seem like it wouldn&#39;t be a bad place to stick around and eat at.  It&#39;s on the nicer end of fast-casual food.  You order at the counter, but then they bring out the food to your table.

So, I ordered a brisket dinner (sauce on the side) and a slab of ribs (sweet and heat sauce) dinner.  Each comes with a potato item, salad, coleslaw and a soft roll.  I stuck with fries.  Concerningly, there may not an a la carte option, though I didn&#39;t actually ask.  Now, I ordered takeout and the food all came in multiple styrofoam containers.  This wasn&#39;t bad, but I kind of wish they had been a bit more vented, because it seemed like there just was a ton of condensation by the time I got them home.  On the plus side though, things remained nice and warm.  My salad arrived already dressed in some small clear plastic containers, which was a bit unfortunate, and the lettuce was clearly a bit wet going in the containers because it had also watered down the dressing some.  The fries were standard crinkle cut.

The ribs were definitely the best meat item.  I&#39;d liken them in quality to Carson&#39;s ribs, where it was your gnawing at them a bit to get all the meat, as opposed to the fall-off-the-bone style.  The sweet-heat sauce was pretty good though. Good flavor and the heat was low, building up over the course of the meal, but it was never bothering me, and I&#39;m a bit of a baby about spicy foods  I&#39;m not one to desire a ton of sauce on my ribs, and it initially looked like it might have been drenched, but it didn&#39;t really turn out that way.

The brisket was a mild disappointment.  I feel like it might have been a bad day or something, because it seemed like one of the tougher briskets I&#39;ve ever encountered if not the toughest.  It was sliced, and each slice seemed awfully solid.  Maybe it was just too lean?  This has been my favorite BBQ item in the past, so I may be a bit more picky about it.

All in all, I&#39;m pretty pleased with my experience.  It&#39;s no Smoque, but it&#39;s a welcome addition to the area.  Prices are reasonable, and you do get plenty of food.   I intend on going again reasonably soon, and there&#39;s a bunch of different items that have potential to try out.  Some interesting looking specials only available at lunch (Boo!).  A few initial concerns, but nothing that can&#39;t be fixed."

Chicago does BBQ ribs well (more specifically rib tips) and that is about it (I&#39;m not talking Carson&#39;s, Twin Anchors or Gale Street Inn which are mediocre in my opinion), I&#39;m talking Honey 1 BBQ or Lem&#39;s, etc. Chicago does not do pork or beef brisket well.

If you have been down to Texas hill country and were fortunate to have dined at the legends of BBQ down there, do NOT come to T-Bob&#39;s expecting the same. BUT, if you are a BBQ starved Yankee like myself who longs for a good BBQ beef brisket and isn&#39;t getting to TX soon, T-Bob&#39;s is the place. This was some of the best beef brisket I&#39;ve had in the North. Thick slices, tender, good smoke ring, sauce optional (ask for it on the side), BBQ beef brisket was the only thing I tried.

I will for sure go back as I was pleased with the brisket."

Fast forward a week. It&#39;s a Sunday night and I&#39;m hungry. My father and I jump in the car and decide to head over to check out Donkey Inn. 

We pull into the lot and see a few motorcycles out front. The lot was very dimly lit and wasn&#39;t very welcoming. Most women prefer a well lit lot. We step inside and see the sign &#34;Please Wait to Be Seated&#34;. 

We patiently waited to be seated. However, the hostess/our waitress was too busy having a conversation with multiple male patrons at the bar. We made eye contact several times but she decided we could wait until she finished her conversation. 

Finally, the waitress comes over and advises us to sit wherever. We decided to sit in a cozy booth and browse the large menu our friend raved about. The waitress practically threw the menus at us and asked us what we wanted to drink. 

I ordered a Diet Coke and my father a glass of house red wine. The drinks came and they were hastily clunked down onto the table. I asked the waitress if it was possible to make a custom omelette. She rolled her eyes and huffed &#34;yeah&#34; under her breath. 

If it&#39;s not obvious by now, there is a major attitude problem with this waitress. I felt like I was being an inconvenience to her. I don&#39;t like to feel this way when going out for dinner. I ordered my custom made steak, mushroom, and cheddar omelette. I ordered it with pancakes and hash browns. My father did the steak and eggs with hash browns.

The waitress stomped off and we both couldn&#39;t believe the horrible attitude we were receiving. Finally, the food came. The omelette was okay, could have eaten better at Denny&#39;s to be completely honest. The eggs had no flavor, almost as if they were cut with water to make a bigger omelette. The steak was horrible with the consistency of pot roast. It had a very off-putting taste to it. The mushrooms were definitely canned. The cheddar cheese was really fake-cheddar product in slice form. The hash browns were pretty good, nice and crispy. The pancakes were the worst I&#39;ve ever had. They had the taste and consistency of cornbread batter. Very grainy and turn to mush when picking up with a fork. I asked the waitress for buttered toast and jam as I could not eat more than a bite of the pancakes. 

Overall, I&#39;m very disappointed with the service, attitude, vibe, and food quality. I don&#39;t spend money to go out to eat to be treated like an inconvenience. The waitress received no tip for treating us so poorly. Ownership needs to retrain the staff on how to treat customers. The only thing going for them is the late night hours and large menu. They get two-stars for being open late on a Sunday. However, I would&#39;ve been better off at McDonalds."

I chose a Friday evening so I could try their Friday Night Fish Fry. They have 5 fish dinner options. I chose the AYCE Beer Battered Ocean Perch dinner for $10.95. Included with the fish was a choice of soup or salad, choice of potato or homemade macaroni and cheese and coleslaw. The fish was lightly battered and you could actually taste the beer in the batter! Five pieces came out with the sides and I received three extra pieces. 

Another reason for the 5 stars is due to the friendliness of the entire staff. From the hostess to the bartender to the servers and even the busboy, everyone was polite, courteous and did all they could to make our dining experience memorable.

The other reason for 5 stars was earned by the bartenders Bloody Mary. The best I&#39;ve ever had! The shot of Guinness she put in it put it over the top!

Also, they open between 7:00am &amp; 9:00am, depending on the day of the week, serving a wide variety of breakfast selections. The best part of the breakfast menu is you can order from it all day until the kitchen closes at midnight on weekends!

The vast menu of appetizer&#39;s, salads, sandwiches, burgers, wraps, fajitas, taco&#39;s, pizza, traditional dinner entrees and pasta dishes means you can come back everyday and order something different each visit and it will take you many months to get through the menu. I won&#39;t be there every day, but I will go back again and again!"

Lunches have been great.  The $5 cheeseburger Wednesday is a great promo, the chili is always good, and lunchtime service has been great.

I&#39;ve went here for dinner once with the girlfriend and we were both pleasantly surprised.  It was pretty busy, but that was to be expected on a Friday Fish Fry night during Lent, lol.  She like the fish fry and would definitely come back for that, and I was definitely pleased with my meal.

Breakfast.  I hear they serve it all day and have heard good things about the skirt steak and eggs.  My GF and I finally tried it out one morning around 8am.  I wasn&#39;t as impressed with the Donkey in terms of breakfast.  Our server looked and acted like she didn&#39;t want to be there, and there was just something not right with the texture of the scrambled eggs.  I am going to assume that the waitress was just having a bad day, as that was the only time that was an issue.  

So as you can see overall the Donkey Inn is above average, and I definitely recommend it.  I do see how at certain times it can seem a little odd there if there are a ton of regulars there.  It does look like regulars get favored.  But I just view that as service that remembers you and treats you right.  Plus if a place has so many regulars, they must be doing something right!"

We were told to seat ourselves. So we picked a table in the middle of the restaurant. For the 15 minutes that were were sitting there, nobody acknowledged us. Nobody gave us any water. Nobody gave us any menus. The two waitresses that passed by us more than ten times never even looked at our table.

The restaurant was not even half full. They have time to ask other people if they want a refill and to collect bills, but they don&#39;t want to keep two hungry customers in the door. 

Good luck with all that."

The food service was so slow it wasn&#39;t worth the aggravation to get it put right. We asked the waitress if there had been a change in kitchen staff but she said no.

Matzah ball soup: A little more &#34;hearty&#34; in flavor than the usual chicken broth you&#39;ll find in most other restaurants. Good for a cold winter day.

Cream of potato soup: Nice and thick texture although a little underwhelming in flavor. Still enjoyable if you like extremely smooth consistency.

Skillet #4: Light and fluffy, not too heavy of a flavor but also not very oily either.

Hamburger: Cooked well and a great deal for 1/2 pound at $7 with a side. Lacks a char type flavor but does have a good level of fat in the patty.

Chips: Homemade, thin and crispy -- light and enjoyable.

Chicken pot pie: Kind of like a nice cream of chicken soup underneath a large piece of puff pastry. One of the more interesting interpretations of the dish and not overly salty.

Orange roughy: The fish was alright, expectedly not amazing given the price but also not bad. The mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables were prepared well and gave it the feeling of the same dish at a classier Italian restaurant (at 6-8 dollars cheaper).

Given the very reasonable prices and variety of items on their menu, I&#39;ll definitely be back."

Has a sign that says dates to the 1930s (can&#39;t recall the exact year). Given that Palatine/Rolling Meadows - well... let&#39;s just say this would have been a bit out of the way then - didn&#39;t stretch that far in 1940 or before - something lasting 70+ years deserves a visit.

The place is usually crowded. I took my daughter there every week after her fencing lessons at 9 PM - and still had a bit of a crowd. Some may take that as a negative; for me - it is the opposite - it shows most people like the place.

The menu is big - and hence has a LOT of choices. For 90+% of the stuff I&#39;ve tried over a dozen or more visits - I haven&#39;t gone wrong.

There tends to be every sort of group here from the biker set to the families. I&#39;ve even had a business lunch here.

For a wide variety of fare and a laidback atmosphere - highly recommend. If you&#39;re looking for gourmet or presentation, skip it."

My personal favorite is the crispy fried chicken where you have the choice of two large breasts and a leg or a 1/2 a chicken.  I like the breasts and leg combination.

Located just north of Euclid Avenue on Plum Grove it&#39;s fairly easy to miss.  Watch for their orange sign.

We all ordered the corned beef and cabbage special which included soup.  They ran out of the regular soup and offered a spicy soup as the substitute.  One of the members of our party could not eat the spicy soup and asked the waitress and ultimately the manager on duty (Christina) to substitute a salad instead of the soup because she could not eat it.  The manager said that she was told not to substitute anything in the special even though she was a manager.  Some of the members of my party were frequent customers of Donkey Inn and made that known to the manager.  An accommodation on the part of the manager (salad for soup) would have been much appreciated and would not have cost Donkey Inn loyal customers.  I suggest the senior management to allow managers to &#34;manage&#34; instead of spouting the company line of no substitutes.  I have passed by the enchilada and burger specials at Donkey Inn several times since our bad manager experience.  There are many other restaurants in the area that will honor our reasonable requests."

This is an awesome half pound burger......beautifully cooked with fries or Tater tots....yes...TATER TOTS or cottage cheese or cole slaw.  There is usually an odd charge for a buck but I pay it without complaining because it is such a good deal. Think of it as a family inn vs. a bar... as it is both. Also serves breakfast and the #3 skillet is my fave meal of all.  Turns a Denver Omelette ingredients  into a skillet instead and throws salsa on top with cheese and eggs...its a gooey lovely thing.  Always loved casserole-like food----that&#39;s my comfort zone.  Awesome grilled cheese as well.  This is not bar food.  Is casual food at its best......what you might make if you had time. Atmosphere kind of western style. Whether I come for lunch or dinner....I always run into people I know and have sold homes to.   Breakfast is a normal price compared to others in the area, but the cheeseburgers are to rave about.  Lots of beer choices.

I went there recently after a long work day, saw a big sign out front saying: &#34;Friday Night Fish Fry - All You Can Eat.&#34; I pull in, so far so good. Then it starts going downhill. 

1. Sitting at the bar, the tender tells me it&#39;s $9.95 for the fish fry, and they have several kinds of fish (cod, perch, etc.). I go for the cod with a pint of Fat Tire beer. Beer was cold, the clam chowder was solid, as was the scoop of home made mash potatoes, small ramiken of cole slaw not terrible, and three small-to-medium sized pieces of fish with tartar sauce. 

2. I&#39;m feeling good, and say I&#39;d like another round of the fish (not the rest). She says: &#34;Oh, the cod isn&#39;t all you can eat.&#34; What? You&#39;re kidding. Maybe she should have let me know that when ordering? I shake my head, NOT HAPPY, but decide not to point out the obvious: BAIT &amp; SWITCH. Or, if the other kinds of fish ARE all you can eat, she might have offered that - but does not. I tell her I just want the bill. 

3. She brings it over and... it&#39;s over $16.00 for what I had. Huh? 

4. I put $20 on the bar, not real excited about rewarding this activity with a decent tip... she sees the money, but does anything else except take care of my bill. 

5. I finally see the owner &amp; ask he if can take care of it... he looks at the bill &amp; cash, and makes an (unfunny) joke about me wanting money back, but I figure it&#39;s better to make a statement with a lame tip (10%) versus fighting with them. 

While it is true you won&#39;t encounter the high society of the NW suburbs in the place, I don&#39;t care about that when it&#39;s time for a cold beer &amp; some decent food. What I do care about is poor service and thinly-veiled bait &amp; switch from anyone. I&#39;m giving this place a second star for the quality of the food I had, nothing else."

The bathrooms were clean, tables clean and service overall good.

The other best thing here - the blooming onion.  It is soooo good.  Really nice batter and dipping sauce with a kick.  This definitely beats the one they have at Outback.  

We tried their rib special one night, and that&#39;s why we gave it only 4 stars.  We love ribs, so we do know a good amount of how they should taste.  These were boiled and pretty slimy.  We&#39;re used to the ones that have the crispy edges where they&#39;ve been slow cooked for a long time and baconized on the edges.  So, just don&#39;t get the ribs. 

Everything else so far - very good.  My favorite is the options they give you.  if you don&#39;t want french fries, you can have cottage cheese, tator tots or a side salad.  That&#39;s pretty sweet in my book considering some places say they won&#39;t do it or if you want a tomato it&#39;s extra.  

Donkey Inn also serves breakfast all day.  I like that too!"

BIG MISTAKE!  Having eaten here many times and being happy with our selections, we were very sad when the pizza was less than appetizing.  My main beef is with the crust which was tough and tasteless.  The sauce was delicious, not too tangy and had a fresh tomato taste.  The cheese was good.  If they would change the crust, they would have a desirable product.  

So, stick with the specials, they are yummy....."

If you want food that is bland and a waitstaff that ignores you, then this place is for you!  The Alfredo tastes like its straight out of a can that&#39;s been sitting on the back shelf covered in dust.  Not once did our server come over to ask if we needed anything or if our food was alright. Last time I checked, that&#39;s their job right?  When the server finally came to clear the table she asked if I didn&#39;t like the Alfredo (clearly since barely any of it was eaten)... I was honest and told her no and you would think she would offer me a discount or a replacement meal but instead all I got was a ditzy &#34;sorry&#34; and she walked away.

After we found a table that was not yet cleaned, we sat down and waited about 15 minutes to get a menu, this was with us asking both of the waitresses.  It took about another 15 minutes to have our order taken, Even though we had decided what we were ordering about 10 minutes earlier.  Once we had our order taken, it was pretty quick for our food to arrive.  The food was okay.  I was very disappointed after waiting so long to have so-so food."

If you&#39;re looking for a local fish fry, I would recommend going there on Fridays for their all you can eat fish fry. It&#39;s very a popular day to go and I understand why. However, I&#39;ve had better fish fries before but it&#39;s not too bad so I&#39;d rate it at a 4 out of 5. Just a word to the wise it can be quite loud.

I can say we were pleasantly surprised. Menu was solid but unsurprising (all-American bar &amp; grill); food quality and quantity were both good; and service was attentive but unobtrusive. Draft beers tasted fresh, so we know they take care to clean the lines and rotate stock. Prices were inexpensive, so you really feel like you&#39;re getting more than you paid for. 

Only negative is that the place is noisy - both the bar patrons and numerous TVs make casual conversation a bit difficult. Not an intimate date spot, but a lot of fun and good eating. We&#39;ll be going back."

I&#39;m partial to their fried chicken which is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, just as it ought to be.
Burgers are respectable and typically done as you like them.
While it sounds odd, they do offer a nice selection of hearty breakfasts as well.

I ordered some beer and ribs which were carefully drenched in bbq sauce to hide the thawed ribs from the freezer, even the drinks were kind of expensive for a neighborhood bar, over all I thought this place had multiple facets to it with different themes going on in a very small place with slightly higher priced drinks and bad bar food, kind of a place you might want to hit when you have no place to go for a few drinks but not necessarily craving a great dinner."

Me friend and I were the only two people in the restaurant and had to wait ten minutes just for someone to acknowledge our existence. Once we got service the lady was rather nice.. At first. 
 
Food: The food took 45 minutes to come out and during that time a family of four walked in, placed their order and got their food before us. The food itself was pale and tasted as if it was heated in a microwave. I ordered the sushi and my friend ordered the teriyaki chicken (which they claim is world famous). The chicken was cold and dry with a lot of sauce slathered on top that turned into caramelized goop. The sushi was dense and plain. It didn&#39;t taste like sushi. It tasted like white rice and old fish.
 
Price: For the quality of the food; it&#39;s beyond over priced. My sushi was $9 for the worst sushi I&#39;ve had and I&#39;ve had gas station sushi. My friends chicken was $12 dollars and he claimed it was some of the worst chicken he&#39;d ever had but that the rice was okay.
 
Restaurant Size: Medium. Plenty of places to sit.
 
Additional Notes: There&#39;s a fridge with all the drink selections near the condiment station, not behind the counter and they will point to the fridge if you ask for a drink."

     The fish is fresh, the rice is cooked very well, and the rolls hold up together. Misoya soup very good. Great ginger dressing on the salad.

I wanted sushi, so this is what I ordered.  I got a spicy tuna roll and a godzilla roll.  It was probably the worst sushi I had ever had.  The spicy tuna didn&#39;t taste like anything.  The roll itself was about 90% rice and there was a very small dab of something in the middle but it wasn&#39;t spicy.  The other roll was better, but not worth the amount I paid for it.

My tuna was just ok, Spicy Tuna is where it went really wrong. This is not spicy tuna. Minced fish of some sort, maybe tuna, with an orange sweet flavored sauce passed off as spicy tuna. There was a small amount of it and it turned the rice the odd orange color of the sauce. Avoid this. Eel roll was also just ok, not much else I can say.

But definitely not the first place I would go to if I want a REAL Japanese meal. Think of it as the Japanese version of Fast Food. 

Long Story: 
1. THE PLACE:  A+. Very clean and spacious. 
2. THE STAFF:  Friendly and helpful. They have never messed up my order ever. That is a A+ on my book.  Their cooks are very FAST in making your orders!
3. PRICING:  B+. Affordable.1 meal cost under $10.  And they take major credit cards.
4. THE FOOD:  I rank their cooking 2.5 to 3 out of 5 stars. I like their teriyaki chicken bento, but their shrimps and vegetable tempura are a blah! 
- Decent serving size on their bento meals. They dont skimp out on the rice.  And I should know what a &#34;decent&#34; serving or rice is! I&#39;m part Asian. You just don&#39;t mess with an Asian person&#39;s rice!
- The also have brown rice. A+ for that option.
- However, their sushis are very bland. and small in service size. I looked at it, and I was like: &#34;NO! This is not 1 whole roll of sushi!&#34; So, if you really want a quick sushi for lunch, head to Mitsuwa instead.

Overall: I would still go here if I&#39;m every in the area and craving for a quick Japanese food. Just don&#39;t order their sushi! SERIOUSLY!"

Fast food Japanese on the go. I recently had the opportunity to try fast food Japanese and left with mixed feelings. I had seen this restaurant many times while shopping in the adjacent shops to Woodfield and did not realize this was an inexpensive food option. The store itself is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall. You are greeted with a large menu consistent of teriyaki dishes with rice or noodles and also sushi. I ended up with the bento box to get the most variety. My box came with ample amount of teriyaki chicken and noodles which were very filling. The california roll was meager and was equivalent to sushi at a chinese buffet. Slightly warm. I also had same edamame which is hard to mess up. Otherwise the food appears to be cooked to order and fresh as well. The only thing is the sauce was a bit on the salty side which made detracted away from the noodles

Pro- low cost teriyaki meal, i did not end up trying the sushi but the prices appear resonable, however I wouldn&#39;t expect the sushi to be great

Con- very salty sauce and the noodles were a bit over cooked

Hidden deal- Promotion teriyaki chicken meal 3.99 with the purchase of any beverage"

I got this place confused with Sakura in Rolling Meadows.  Hadn&#39;t been to Sakura in ages, and when we passed by Sarku Japan on Meacham Road, I got excited cuz I thought Sakura had moved and/or opened an &#39;Express&#39; spot.  We parked in front of Sarku and went inside; it was not until I got to the counter that I would fully admit/realize/recognize that this was NOT Sakura.  Sarku Japan is akin to a Panda Express.  My mind then registered that I&#39;d eaten at their chains in various mall food courts.  Hahahaha.  My husband, though he knew I was confused, played along with it cuz he was amused by my mix-up (no wonder he kept asking if I was &#39;sure&#39; I wanted to eat here!  All the while I&#39;m raving about old times/good meals at Sakura!).

Regardless, Sarku Japan was still good.  Order process was quick and seamless - food was ready promptly.  I got my teriyaki fill with the beef/shrimp teriyaki.  Husband had the Bento box and variety of sushi rolls.  Kids had cali rolls and chicken teriyaki kids bowls.   LOTS of food with the usual greasiness, but still a solid meal.  And while it was NOT what I was expecting, it was also not bad for fast-food stir-fry/sushi.   Even my husband shut up after having a bite.  So, this will definitely be a future go-to spot for quick Japanese food."

I ordered a salmon roll ($3.99) with spicy mayo and spider roll ($7.99) and also a bottle of Vitamin Water ($1.99). Both were 6 pieces and would have loved it if they were more generous with the salmon roll (8 pc pls!) as it was tiny to start.

Among all fast food restaurants, I like Sarku Japan, KFC, and Chipotle just the same. KFC is a little messy to eat though, so I prefer Sarku Japan and Chipotle for lunch during work days. I normally go there once or twice a week, usually when I don&#39;t bring my lunch from home.

Menu (9/10)
They have different varieties of Teriyaki dishes with Chicken being the best. They also have different varieties of sushi although I&#39;ve never tried them.

Price (9/10)
Score of 9 if you have the $1 off coupon. Without it, I&#39;ll give it 8. It&#39;s comparable to other fast food restaurants out there without coupon and cheaper with coupon.

Ambiance (9/10)
Bright, spacey, and clean unlike most of fast food restaurants out there. Many of their patrons prefer take out, so it can be relatively quiet to hold a business or private conversation that&#39;s not confidential.

Service (9/10)
They&#39;ll bring the food to you if you eat in, but you&#39;re requested to throw away the leftover in trash after you&#39;re done. No tipping necessary.

Location (9/10)
Right at the heart of Schaumburg business area, just across the street from Woodfield Mall. I don&#39;t give it a 10 because it&#39;s not in my office building.

Overall score: 9/10"

Portions are good for the price, however it can be a bit greasy at times.  Stay away from the Tempura as it tends to be oily and undercooked.

Never heard of this place. Coworker and I were leaving work late on a Friday evening, and thought, &#34;Hm. What a crappy week. Let&#39;s reward ourselves with some fine dining!&#34; So we&#39;re driving toward a restaurant until my eye catches &#34;Sarku Japan.&#34; ooOOoo! Sushi! Expensive stuff! So, it&#39;s in this plaza where I know there&#39;s no way you can fit a classy sushi joint in, but I was tired, and fed up with thinking, so we just went.

We pull up to the sign and I see &#34;Teriyaki&#34;  :/  sigh... &#34;Sushi Express&#34;... FACEPALM! So....

MISO SOUP
One of these days I&#39;ll get unlazy and go and look at what brand of Instant Miso Soup it is I have in my pantry. This is the second review I&#39;m writing where I&#39;ve alluded to it and mentioned that the instant stuff tasted better than the restaurant stuff. Now I know, it&#39;s hard to call &#34;Sarku Teriyaki &amp; Sushi Express&#34; a restaurant, but hey, McDonald&#39;s calls themselves that too. The Miso just plain sucked. Watery, not much flavor, just...whatever.

EDAMAME
There&#39;s really nothing to mess up here. I only wish it was served warm. It was lightly salted. It felt like it was at once hot and steamy, but now it&#39;s just cold, like refrigerator cold! ...but I know that&#39;s how some places roll.

SUSHI
There was just nothing spectacular about these rolls; however, the Green Dragon Roll is $9 and the Philly is $5! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! For fast food &#34;Sushi Express&#34; quarter size rolls?! REALLY?! They&#39;re definitely edible, but they&#39;re below Todai&#39;s standards. And think about it. If you can buy 3 of these Dragon Rolls, you could have gotten into Todai and at least have some crab legs and creme brulee. They give you about a speck of Wasabi with each order of sushi, and you grab your soy sauce from near the drink fountains. At least they&#39;re not blanketed in unneeded rice. They&#39;re on par with the Royal Buffet sushi, but below even Todai&#39;s standards...way below!

EXPRESS-ING MYSELF
Ok, listen, I&#39;ll be honest. I wanted a indulgent, savory, and hardy meal after a $h17ty week. Having this fast food Japanese stuff really put a damper on my mood too, so I guess I&#39;m still a bit salty from that. But I think my ratings are still fair and unbiased. Look, sushi may have been a hip new thing for Chicago at one point in time, but that has long since gone. There&#39;re hundreds of sushi joints around Chicago and the burbs now. Trying to sensationalize it by sticking the word &#34;Express&#34; isn&#39;t going to buy you anything. And legit sushi places have deals where the basic rolls are like $3 and nicer rolls are like $7, and they&#39;re double in size than Sarku! This is a horrible deal, and it&#39;s not like the &#34;Express&#34; actually made my sushi come out any quicker. It came out about as fast as if it were a legit sushi bar. Also, my coworker got the Teriyaki Chicken, and not only did it look disgusting and horrible, he even said it was the worst he&#39;s ever had. 

Maybe in 1985, Sarku could have been cool, or hip, or a place to get your exotic sushi fix, but come on, it&#39;s 2011, and yeah, we&#39;re the midwest, but we get enough exposure to the stuff that this is kind of insulting. Check it, I&#39;m a pretty harsh reviewer, but 4/10 stars for sushi and 2/5 stars in general is really not THAT bad! I&#39;m not saying that the sushi was horrible, I&#39;m saying that at $9 and $5 a roll, with bad miso, and Teriyaki that&#39;s actually frightening, this is not the place to go!"

A coworker invited me there.  I was excited to try them out.  The excitement turned to disappointment as soon as I got my food.  BTW, I was there at 12 PM and it was empty...perhaps a sign?
The layout is like noodles and company.  You walk in, order at the counter and find a spot.  Once your food is ready, they call your number and you get it at the counter.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki with brown rice.   Right off the bat, I could see that the chicken was low quality with sinew and a grey color.  
The rice was bland, but got a bit better after I added some soy sauce.  The chicken had no flavor, but did feature some solid gristle and connective tissue...yum.  The side cabbage, broccoli (1 piece) and carrot (1 piece) salad was the best thing.  I ate half of the meal and trashed the rest.  I didn&#39;t even care to share my feedback with the workers; I just wanted to go.  
Sub par place, serving sub par food.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere decent."

And it&#39;s not bad, really.  The place was a bit dead when we went on a weekday night for dinner, which was fine, although our food was very slow - they were out of edamame and had to replace it.  It&#39;s all extremely average, food court kind of fare, but it&#39;s cheap and (usually) fast, so take from that what you want.

I do recommend the drink machine though - there are flavors of normal pop I&#39;ve never seen before in that thing.  I think it was dropped off from the future by a time-traveling Japanese scientist, but I&#39;m not sure."

Japanese fast food has Sarku Express.

It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s just not great. And it&#39;s definitely not authentic Japanese, but it&#39;s passable.

I had the Deluxe chicken teriyaki Bento ($10.04 after tax) which was pretty generous in portion and actually tasted pretty good. One thing that I&#39;ll definitely avoid next time is getting anything with their version of tempura. Tempura is supposed to be a light batter, a clean crisp crunch, and if done well, it won&#39;t taste like you&#39;re eating a wad of grease and oil. Unfortunately, not only was their tempura not light, seriously extra crunchy, and similar to eating a wad of grease and oil--the shrimp tempura was all that AND cold. Yeck. Stomach still hurts from the massive amount of oil ingested.

It&#39;s unfortunate that other places are closer to my work, better quality for $10 at lunch, and better for you.

The Coke Freestyle machine is pretty cool though, and I don&#39;t even drink pop."

Everything was so good, we came back THE VERY NEXT DAY!  Our waitress from Saturday remembered us right away, and the owner stopped by to say hello and welcome us back.  They all even remembered my daughter, which I thought was so sweet.  After all, it was HER demands that we go back for Checkers pancakes a day later. 

The service here is great; genuinely friendly and attentive.  The owners are also very appreciative of their customers, and walk around often, checking in on everyone.

My main criteria: good reviews and zero wait when I called. I was a bit worried when the woman who took my call assured me with confidence that she could seat a party of two with no wait. Was that a good sign? Or a sign that this place maybe isn&#39;t that great? We rolled the dice, and I am glad we did. Turns out that the non-wait was really just the result of a large restaurant and lickety split service. It&#39;s fast, efficient and -- yay for me -- delicious.

Checkers actually reminded me a lot of the diners back home on the East Coast. No frills. Just fast, efficient service and good down home food. We were greeted immediately by a friendly host, who made us feel welcomed and seated us quickly. Our waitress was great, coming with water and coffee immediately, giving us time to peruse the huge menu and then taking our order. She also was great about stopping back to check on us, keeping our cups refilled and making sure we had everything we needed. And she had a great, warm personality. We really enjoyed our service.

Foodwise, very good. Nothing crazy gourmet here -- just good down home breakfast. I got a bacon and cheese omelette, which was big, fluffy and came with my preferred American cheese even though I totally forgot to inquire about the type of cheese that came in the dish. The fact that they use American without me having to ask for it shows a deep understanding of what a breakfast omelette should be. (LOL, seriously, someone stop me.) It came with nice crispy breakfast potatoes/homefries and a side of pancakes that were just bomb. I basically ate my whole omelette, all of the pancakes and as many potatoes as I could fit. My husband got the pork chop breakfast partially because it&#39;s kind of a rare thing to find on a menu. The two chops, two eggs and breakfast potatoes were all good -- or so he said. I was too busy with my own breakfast to bother with his.

A very solid breakfast joint and a really nice discovery. I hope we&#39;re back in the area sometime so we can make a return visit."

-Eggs, sausage, bacon: These three items were pretty disappointing. My scrambled eggs tasted bland and a little off - not sure if it was from the oil they use or the method of cooking. Sausage and bacon were both a bit rubbery and unimpressive.

It&#39;s also worth noting that their skillets are large, in charge, and tasty to boot. I&#39;m continuing my breakfast quest through the Northwest burbs but Checkers certainly isn&#39;t a poor choice if you seek sweet service and tasty pancakes."

Walk in... a senior at the register walked me to my table...

It took around 3 minutes to get greeted by the most miserable waiter ever. Not even half a smile not a Good Morning.. just a &#34;coffee ma&#39;am?&#34;

&#34;YESS PLEASE&#34; ... he pours it and leaves... 

Another 2 minutes later the bus boy brings me some creamer I got regular and French vanilla. Which was nice... the coffee was pretty bad I ended up switching to Coca-Cola.

Later a waitress came by and was super nice. Didn&#39;t catch her name but she was super nice towards my two hungry daughters. 

The oldest ordered Mickey pancakes and I ordered a veggie skillet and added bacon.. and pancakes with chocolate chips which were going to be for my youngest daughter.

Food arrived around 10 mins later. Which is great.

I get a taste of my daughters choc.chip pancakes... WOW. Disgusting... 

My oldest loved her Mickey.

My veggie skillet disgusting... took 4 bites the most and couldn&#39;t keep going. Potatoes were super bad.

Honestly I&#39;ve never had food as bad as this one.

Waitress came and ask if I wanted a box never asked if there was something wrong with skillet.

Never going back again.

By the way if you get a kids drink make sure you ask for it to be brought to you when food arrives. The little cup is so small they will drink it in two sips.."

The location was selected for the monthly get together for about a dozen friends.  Checkers accommodated us easily. 

The decor is very reminiscent of a 50s diner, but instead of being squeezed into an area the size of a subway car, the dining room is large,  bright and comfortable.  For good or bad, there is no ambient music.  A 50s/60s soundtrack would have been a plus to my way of thinking. 

Rather than a menu limited to burgers, fries, shakes and fountain creations the fare is fairly typical Greek Greasy Spoon. That&#39;s what I was expecting when I walked through the door so I was not disappointed.  The menu is fairly large for a restaurant that is only open for breakfast and lunch.  And there are not a lot of &#34;dinner&#34; type options. But if you are wanting dinner you&#39;d have gone somewhere else to begin with. The biggest plus here is that I didn&#39;t need my reading glasses to be able to peruse the menu. 

Service was friendly, but not extremely prompt. I chalk that up to the size of the group.  Two waitresses were tasked with taking and delivering our orders to the table.  I suspect the delay was in coordinating the effort both in order taking and food preparation.  Still, I have waited longer to be served with parties half our size. 

To my tastes, the food was acceptable but not exceptional. Others in the party were well pleased, so take my comment with a grain of salt - something you WON&#39;T need to add to your meal!  I had the potato pancakes which were highly recommended in other reviews. Nowhere as good as Grandma&#39;s or the ones my wife makes. But they were passable for this area.  Others ordered buttermilk pancakes and were very happy. One person ordered the Palestine Pancake and said it was exceptional.  I&#39;ll have to try that next visit. 

As a plus, the staff noticed that two of the ladies in the group were celebrating birthdays.  A nice ice cream sundae was presented to each of them gratis.  Very observant wait staff! 

Bottom line: a decent meal at a fair price. You won&#39;t walk away hungry."

Then I got a coupon in the mail for 10% off of the entire bill, so I tucked that bad boy away for safekeeping.

It was a bright and sunny Saturday morning in June.  For some odd reason, I could.not.sleep.for.the.life.of.me.  I couldn&#39;t even begin to tell you why because I was exhausted, but I decided that since I couldn&#39;t sleep, nobody could.  My hungry ass definitely woke my husband up by bouncing on the bed and asking him to take me to breakfast.

Yes, I am five years old.  And bless his heart, he took me,.

At 7 am.  What a guy.

We were one of three tables in the joint.  It got busier as we left later, but nobody in their right mind wanted to be up that early, I guess.  Of the people that were there, though, they were obviously regulars.  The waitresses were joking around with each table &#34;Don&#39;t you usually sit there?&#34; and asking them about their families and generally caring about their customers.  It was a nice touch.

For our meals, I noticed the Italian Sausage Skillet (or something like that) on their specials board.  It had Italian sausage and a lot of veggies, so it was right up my alley.  They were more than willing to make it with egg whites, too.  It came with toast or pancakes and hash browns.  These hash browns were more &#34;shaved&#34;.  Read: Not shredded, but more like fried potato discs.  They were really good and cooked to my liking!

My husband ordered the french toast and an extra side of bacon and had nothing but rave reviews about it.  We definitely loved both of our meals, and we had plenty of leftovers, too!  So basically, we got four meals out of two for the low price of about $20!  

Note; I asked for my husband&#39;s coffee, to go, and it costs $1.10 including tax for the to-go cup.  Some restaurants have it for free, but this was the only downside.

The waitresses were friendly, the place was clean, the food was good, and the prices were right.  I was definitely impressed with Checkers, and I can&#39;t wait to go back.  Maybe one day, I will be one of the &#34;regulars&#34; :)"

When I heard we were going to Checkers, I though they meant the fast-food place and was confused why I&#39;d never seen one around here before. Then we pull up to this place, a brick building with a sign that says, &#34;Checkers Pancake House.&#34; OH. OK. A pancake house for lunch? Could be good.

The interior of this place wasn&#39;t what I expected: red &amp; silver diner-style chairs and booths on a carpeted floor with waiter service. It was as if they couldn&#39;t decide what kind of atmosphere to create so they merged a couple together. I kind of loved it.

We sat at a round table in the middle of the restaurant and a smiling, friendly waitress took our orders. Everyone was smiling -- bus boys, waiters, managers, patrons, the chubby little baby that one of my lunch mates brought (hers). The place oozed of happiness and community. (Awwww!)

I ordered a vegetarian omelet, which came with hash browns and toast. My food arrived in a timely manner -- and in huge amounts! I felt full just looking at it! Before I dove in, I noticed a lot of tomatoes and feta. I was bummed - I&#39;m not a fan of giant chunks of feta cheese. I was actually confused about the addition of this cheese as I didn&#39;t remember that being on the menu. After quite a few bites, I realized that that there were no vegetables inside the omelet other than tomatoes. Tomatoes and feta cheese? What...?

The manager came over and asked how our meals were.

I pointed to my food and said, &#34;This is a vegetarian omelet, right?&#34;

&#34;Ah, no, that&#39;s the feta omelet.&#34;

&#34;What... I didn&#39;t order that. I ordered a vegetarian omelet. I don&#39;t like feta cheese.&#34;

&#34;I am so sorry, would you like me to make you a vegetarian omelet right now?&#34;

At this point, we had to wrap up and head back to work, so I wasn&#39;t really in the mood to get more food. I was kind of full from the bread and hash browns I had consumed too. I declined the offer for the omelet and just told him I was done with it. He asked if I liked it, to which I responded with, &#34;I suppose so, it wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t what I wanted. I just don&#39;t like feta cheese that much.&#34; He offered more sincere apologies and cleared my plate from the table. I kind of felt embarrassed that I didn&#39;t notice this earlier, but oh well.

I was never given a check. When I went up to pay for my food, he told me they that weren&#39;t going to charge me for it because it wasn&#39;t what I ordered. I offered to pay for it anyway because I ate half of the food, but the manager wouldn&#39;t hear of it. It &#34;wasn&#39;t his style.&#34; How nice of him! He handled the whole thing with such sincere generosity. It&#39;s this kind of customer service that makes someone want to come back. I think I will."

We strolled in and immediately felt at home, at this cute diner.

The service is terrific, the coffee flows like Niagara Falls and is as reliable as Old Faithful.

We popped in on a whim and loved it.

It&#39;s an unassuming, local, friendly place. One table was full of what appeared to be the local ladies &#34;canasta club&#34;, complete with up-do&#39;s, liberally applied lipstick and conversation revolving around Gladys, the one member who failed to show up. 

And do they serve pancakes...all kinds. They take pride in their special batter, creating German, Apple (serves two and takes 40 minutes to bake), Dutch, Palestine (rolled with sour cream and cointreau), Idaho Potato (with applesauce or sour cream- your choice) and every type of fruit. 

They also have an incredible assortment of crepes and blintzes to go along with all the egg, omelete, french toast and waffle choices.

Everyone at the table ordered something different, and all the portions were perfect, delivered toasty warm and with a generous smile!

I tried the Blueberry and Banana breakfast drink and a side of the original cakes. They were fluffy, filling and fantastic!"

I ordered the thick French toast and a side of bacon. The French toast was good tasting but not exceptional. The bacon order came out as 4 pieces but they were not uniform. Two of the pieces were on the small side. For $3.79 I would have expected larger sizes. Also, though I ordered the &#34;thick&#34; French toast, they seemed just like regular size to me. The coffee was just mediocre. I would expect better coffee in a pancake house. However, it was acceptable but that&#39;s all. Over all a 3 stars out of 5 or an average to good meal.

Although nothing we tried stood out as fantastic (we had an omelette and a skillet) it was done well and served in a courteous manner in a very well kept and cleaned interior.  Prices were inline with location and quality served.

The only gripe I have for our visit is the pathetic slices of bacon we received for a side order. The bacon was paper thin and really didn&#39;t satisfy my bacon craving.  Sure there was about 5 pieces but it would require three strips sandwiched together to create a standard thickness piece. I felt it was a ripoff and won&#39;t be ordering that side again.

Service was very attentive and managerial presence was constant.  I watched them make special accommodations for babies and disabled patrons and not flinch a bit at special dietary requests.  I&#39;d say service is the highlight of Checkers.

Another decent place for breakfast in the Schaumburg area."

Walking in I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was. Often you&#39;ll see diners a little run down, but not this place! Very clean with a great atmosphere. We were greeted immediately and shown to a table. The entire staff was incredibly friendly, our server joked with us, and everyone had a smile on their face. 

The food was pretty good. I typically always order the same type of food when going for breakfast. Either french toast or pancakes, with hash browns, eggs, and bacon. I&#39;m a little picky on my hash browns as I prefer crispy ones, and they actually made them a little mushy. So unfortunately I&#39;ll skip them next time around. Other than that, my food was delicious. My husband thought his breakfast steak meal was only &#39;okay&#39; whatever that means(I tasted it and thought it was good, anyway!)

It was moist and so yummy, melt in your mouth deliciousness! Sausage links were great. Comes with 2 eggs but our waitress brought out 4. Very generous. I also love the fresh squeezed orange juice. Wow delicious there! I wish I would have gotten the full size. I have a picky daughter and even she finished her French toast! Kudos to French toast! Our waitress was so accommodating and very helpful. She was also patient and friendly. Great attitude with the customers. 

My second time here I had ordered the eggs florentine. Yummy once again! Everything was perfect. The English muffin was toasted but not too burnt slightly crunchy. It does come with hash browns but I don&#39;t like hash browns so I had that substituted with French Fries. My daughter ate the fries. Waitress was friendly. Came to check up on us a couple of time. Very attentive!

My third time I went back to French toast since I couldn&#39;t get enough! Still delicious as always. I should try their lunch menu.

Now, the only way I eat my over easy eggs is with hash browns and toast.. which were no where to be found. I called to let them know (they&#39;re like 2 min away from my work so not a big deal to go back) and the guy said oh sorry the guy taking your order is new and that meal doesn&#39;t come with hash browns.... I already knew this and had changed my order so I COULD get hash browns when I placed it.  The guy on the phone was pretty much arguing with me about these stupid hash browns saying well what do you want me to do... uhm give me my hash browns maybe?

She was clearly annoyed by our request for a clean set of utensils that as she quickly turned to leave our table, she knocked a glass of water over.

It&#39;s nothing fancy but who wants fancy for breakfast? That&#39;s what brunch is for. I don&#39;t do brunch. So I&#39;ve been here a few times and have had delicious meals each time. Coffee is good and hot and keeps coming.

I&#39;ve tried a Benedict (on point), a special with French toast, eggs and probably bacon that was good, but I still don&#39;t understand why most places have to dust their pancakes, French toast, and waffles with corn starchy sugar, BUT I&#39;ve had an omelette with spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes and Monterey jack cheese every time (maybe 5 times)  since I tried it. It comes with feta cheese but I can&#39;t abide feta. They are happy to substitute my cheese of choice.

Now I&#39;m not much for pancakes unless they are potato or buckwheat. Every time I go there its for the buckwheat pancakes (where else can you find them?) but when they ask for my order, out of my mouth comes, &#34;the Spartan omelette with jack instead of feta and an English muffin please.&#34; Maybe today will be the day I order buckwheat pancakes minus powdered sugar but add a side or two of applesauce. Oh, and a side of bacon, crispy."

Ordered the taco salad special, which came with soup, and Dayle ordered the gyro special, also with soup. 

The lentil soup was really good. They were able to pack a lot of flavor in the broth and the beans and whatever else was in there was good. Chicken noodle soup was standard fair and was also tasty. 

Taco salad was enormous to the point of where I only ate half and still couldn&#39;t fit it into the take home box. Gyro was on par with what you&#39;d expect from a gyro.

Prices are decent, not the best and not bad at the same time."

I ended up ordering the peach blintzes, and when I got it, it was pretty much not what I expected at all.  When I think of a blintz, I think of a light, somewhat flexible dough filled with sweetened ricotta cheese...or SOME resemblance of that.  What I ended up getting was a hard pancake (almost like a crepe...except more overcooked), filled with what seemed like some unsweetened sour cream.  It was runny, flavorless, and not at all the texture I was expecting.  Also, the peaches were clearly out of a can, which is whatever.  I literally only took 3 bites (and I&#39;m not a picky eater by any means) because I just couldn&#39;t eat it.  My boyfriend tried it and after putting syrup, jam, butter, and pretty much anything we could find at the table came to the same, &#34;no way man&#34; that I did.  He ended up getting the eggs, bacon, hash browns, and french toast, but it&#39;s hard to mess up those things.  Cost was ok too I suppose.  Affordable, but nothing spectacular."

Checkers is small and typically busy, but we&#39;re always seated right away and the food comes out quickly. Inside, it has a bit of a retro 50s style, but it also has a really modern feel at the same time. It&#39;s definitely not your typical Sunday afternoon, clam chowder, senior discount type of diner. Although they might serve clam chodwer and offer a senior discount.. I&#39;m not sure. They have all the staples of a fantastic pancake house, but they offer a more current vibe. The music is always on a somewhat hip station, which I like. The food has never disappointed, and I swear they serve Dunkin Donuts coffee, which is refilled as soon as I drink half the cup. The service is wonderful, everyone is always friendly, and the manager/owner (I&#39;m not positive) always comes around to each table just to check on the service and even refill your coffee for you. I hear tons of conversations between regulars and their waitresses, and I think that says a lot about a business. Clearly lots of people discover this place and return time and again, just like we do. I highly recommend anyone in the area to give Checkers a shot.

Previously Gaynors&#39; Restaurant &amp; Pub
100% Meh unless you&#39;re a functioning day drinker.  The biggest let down of anything that says &#34;Grill&#34; in the name, is when they don&#39;t do a great job grilling the absolute basics like a burger.

I do really like the rebrand name and how they gave the doors an etched look with the new name.

They have a really wonderful saloon (not overly oldtimey) atmosphere in an excellent location and the bar itself is well stocked with nice seating and good tv&#39;s.  But because of this they rely on game-day traffic too much.  All they would have to do is step up their basics like burgers and sides to have a steady lunch base of customers on non-game-days as well.

I tried the new &#34;Filthy Burger&#34;.  Advertised as:
Stacked with pulled pork, bacon, pepper jack cheese, onion, tomato and lettuce topped with Four Roses Bourbon BBQ sauce

Stacked was an understatement.  The bottom 2/3 of the burger was buried under about 1/2lb or more of pulled pork which i ate with a fork until uncovering my burger.  Honestly I was kind of getting full at that point which is odd because I&#39;m a big guy and big eater but pulled pork in bbq sauce is pretty heavy.

The biggest tragedy was the sides :(  The fries were generic and overcooked so they were flavorless and not worth eating.  Their was a nice looking piece of corn on the cob but was sadly boiled far too long and was mushy.  I didn&#39;t even try the coleslaw.  

Under the pile of bbq pulled pork I discovered some nice pepperjack cheese melted into a very little bit of what seemed like shoestring onions that I didn&#39;t see in the burger description.  Maybe I hallucinated those or they were fine cut onion.  I tossed the lettuce and tomato which looked fresh but were unnecessary on a pulled pork/burger sandwich.  The burger itself was correctly cooked but tasted like those bland preformed patties you buy in bulk and then fry.  Leaving zero pink in the middle.  Just a bland gray patty.

Apparently what their famous for is their $1 Taco days with carefully portioned meat amounts per taco.  I haven&#39;t tried them but assume their good based on how well they have sold when I was there before.  But who wants to go to an irish pub for lunch to get tacos?  It makes very little sense.  

It is so cheap and easy to make a good, fresh, handmade, beef burger and simple sides.  Why not do it right?  I will go back and try the new items but I don&#39;t have high hopes sadly :("

It&#39;s always funny to me because some families may be seated in the back having dinner when our huge group of rowdy drunkards rolls in. I see Gaynor&#39;s as more of a sports dive bar where pitchers of swill are usually in order. I&#39;m talking a pitcher of swill for $7 on Saturday nights - now that&#39;s a special. They have specials each and every day and the prices are right.

I&#39;ve picked off my friends&#39; appetizers before and have always been pleased with everything I had. If a place serves you 5 apps on a garbage can lid for $20, you can safely assume it&#39;s a dive. Their options of apps are pretty delicious though - deep fried bacon, fried pickles, wings, friend mushrooms, onion rings, slides, mac &amp; cheese bites, cheese sticks, chicken strips, deep fried tacos. As you can see, everything is deep fried on the app menu aside from the sliders which rest assured have their own unhealthy virtues.. I love the midwest.

I always have fun at Gaynor&#39;s and am really happy with their beer prices. They sometimes have a band playing to boot!"

I work in the area, and the friends I usually go out to lunch with decided to give it a try, as we&#39;ve driven past it several times before.  I&#39;ll put the problems with this place in a list form for easier reading:
1.  ZERO cars in the parking lot, similar to Pierre&#39;s experience.  It took 45 minutes (in the height of the lunch rush) before another customer appeared.  Red Flag #1.
2.  As soon as we opened the door, another guy and I both thought it smelled like stale beer and ammonia... basically, my fraternity&#39;s basement after an epic weekend.  Great for my fraternity, not for a restaurant.  It&#39;s one of those places where the management seems to be cutting all the corners, and it definitely shows.  Red Flag #2
3.  The drinks came in glasses so small and ice-filled you only got 3 gulps before it was gone, and I STILL rejected my iced tea since it tasted so funky.
4.  The bread was several days old and moldy.  Red Flag #3
5.  I had only 2 bites of my turkey Reuben before giving up, and my friend could only stomach 3 of his fish and chips (he later described it as &#34;fish jerky&#34;).  Silver lining:  the fries and chips were actually OK!

The best part of the experience was when the bartender (who disappeared for 5 minutes at a time several times, even though we were the only customers in the place) did not put up a fight when I asked her to remove our charges from the bill.  

Not sure if I&#39;d recommend this place for anything edible unless it comes out of a sealed plastic wrapper.  I half expected to see Gordon Ramsay burst through the front door with a &#34;Kitchen Nightmares&#34; film crew in tow at any moment.

Farmhouse On North is a brand new gem located in the heart of downtown Barrington. Everything served here is made from scratch by the fantastic chef, Marcanthony. It&#39;s truly Farm to Table - everything plated here is from VERY nearby farms so it&#39;s 101% locally sourced. They even have their own off-site garden where they grow many of the herbs and vegetables!

Aside from the incredible seasonal food offerings, what I love so much about Farmhouse is the atmosphere. Seriously - I feel like I&#39;m walking into my dream Country Living home.

Mike (manager) &amp; Meghan (owner) have created such a welcoming, yet classy environment. The atmosphere paired with high quality food &amp; presentation make for an unbelievable experience.

See you at the Farmhouse table?"

The company was awesome, the ambience homey and divine, the service spectacular and the food was yummilicious (defined as extremely delicious, usually to the point where the person or persons begin to constantly crave the article that tastes so good).

I went on a Wednesday night and the bar was actually hoping because a charity event was going on with some fun prizes. Plus, they apparently have wine tasting each Wednesday so that was also going on.

We were able to snag the last couple of seats at the bar. I asked about beers on tap and they actually had just three drafts. However, one was Revolution Unsessionable which I had never had before. It turned out to be a delicious beer, yum! I asked the bartender about the bar &amp; though he was very nice he didn&#39;t seem to know if they specialized in cocktails, wine or what exactly. I would venture to say it was more of a cocktail bar though since they seemed to mostly have specialty mixed drinks.

I loved the low key atmosphere and smaller size of this venue. Plus it was great actually being able to hear the conversation with the person I was with. Mixed crowd but everyone seemed very friendly."

A great stop for some reasonably priced drinks, which are a pretty generous size for what you pay. Their specials for this Thursday night included $5 margaritas, and they actually came in a tall glass (maybe a pint size?). I really appreciated the decor of this place and the pub next door. Also, on a Thursday night the Annex was pretty crowded with some older folks. Our waitress, also older, was very friendly and came to us from the bar right away even though there were more than a few people there. If you are looking for a younger crowd- head on over next door to the pub. Otherwise, the Annex is an awesome place for some good drinks!"

We had gone to some other bars first and couldn&#39;t find anywhere to sit so we passed. No one had ever been to The Annex before but we gave it a try. I am glad we did. 

The drinks we had were delicious (and reasonably priced). We had a round of the peppermint martinis that were a special. They were very good and only about $8. There was also a big selection of beer and other cocktails. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice as well and you could order late night food from the kitchen (always a plus). 

The place was great for a get together. The had a jukebox but the music wasn&#39;t terribly loud so you could still have a conversation. The only negative was the speed. The drinks did seem to take quite a bit but nothing crazy.

My friends and I will definitely be back!"

I had been wanting to try this place put for a while. I need up disappointed in this place. The bartender was not very knowledgeable. The CD ended and since the place was pretty empty other then regulars we sat in awkward silence for a while until the bartender went to start the CD over. The bartender also had a friend or coworker visiting her who thought it was super cool to drop f-bomb at a loud volume like they were going out of style. There was also a table of preteens which seemed a bit out of place in a bar like atmosphere. 

Our waiter was very friendly, and the food was decent. The Irish Nachos were good, but super salty. The waiter raved over the fish and chips, but I did think they were anything special. I also thought it was a small portion for the price. 

I doubt I will be returning anytime soon..."

I walked in to the Annex on Halloween with my lovely girlfriend.  A few people were dressed up for the festivities.  The bartender was a thundercat which I thought was pretty good.  The atmosphere was nice.  Very modern with floor to ceiling light fixtures that changed colors.  We got to sit right by one so our faces changed colors all night.  They wern&#39;t obnoxious at any point throughout the meal.

I had the Founders Seasonal beer and it was delicious.  The menu was explained as small plate dishes.  Small menu but I&#39;ll take small over a big menu.  We had the Mac N Cheese and the Scallops.  They were both very tasty.  A little pricey, but I say that in all my reviews. 

This will be a nice little spot in Barrington for people to hang out and have drinks and appetizers.  I will be back for sure.  Very nice place and very nice people.  Congrats to the Annex."

So we stopped by Saturday night at 11:45pm. Walked in, nice looking place, love the hardwood floor and brick wall look. Lighting was nice as well. There were about 10 people there two sitting at a table (couple) about 8 to the left of the bar. Seemed to be three bartenders as there was three people behind the bar in black t-shirts. 

We walked up to the middle of the bar were all the beer tappers were took off our coats sat down. For 15 minutes we watched as the bar tenders stood and talked to people not once looking over or asking if we wanted a drink. One bartender walks by goes around and goes outside for a cigarette. 

After 15-20 minutes, we had enough put back on our coats and walked out. HORRIBLE service. What bar acts like this? Not one of the bartenders even bothered to ask if we wanted a drink. There were only 10 people in the place the whole time and not one of the 10 people there ordered a drink while we sat and watched, yet we wanted to order.

I will never go back just because of this. It&#39;s a bar, they are supposed to serve drinks. 
Horrible service. No wonder there was only 10 people there on a sat night. With service like this the place won&#39;t last. 

Manage your bartenders!!!!

The only plus, I got to use the bathroom on the way out. No one said anything, the only good thing during my time there."

This place used to be Park Avenue, which (in my opinion) was a little pricey and stuffy with just passable food. The Annex seems to be a better fit for this space since it&#39;s more reasonably priced, and just seemed more welcoming. Our drinks were poured with skill, the service was friendly and the eggplant fries were served hot and salty, like a good fry should be. Pretty good selection of beers on tap too (Founders, Two Brothers, etc). Looking forward to going back for more of the small plates, and curious to see what the DJ that comes in on weekend nights is all about. I imagine it will be more like unobtrusive art gallery background noise, than it will be house hits inspiring riotous dancing... but I guess we&#39;ll have to go back to know for sure."

It seemed really quaint and cute, but didn&#39;t seem very popular. I thought it would have been, considering Barrington is pretty &#34;uppy&#34; and &#34;classy&#34;. None the less, it didn&#39;t survive, but I&#39;m glad they replaced it with The Annex! Great craft beer selection. Taps rotate fairly frequently. I believe it is the same owner at McGonigal&#39;s. Crowd was a mix of both older and younger. A young girl and somewhat older guy who served us were friendly, talkative, and helpful. I think they both bartend or used to bartend next door at McGonigal&#39;s. Place wasn&#39;t crowded at all, but it&#39;s ok because the first time I went here, I went with a couple girls to chat over a few drinks. The girl who served us was down to earth, around our age, and chatted with us a bit, which was cool. She made my girlfriend a martini that was really good. Can&#39;t remember exactly what it was, but I remember it being pinkish red. Maybe something with strawberry? I had a craft beer called Celebrator. Considering I&#39;ve tried over 500 beers, I was impressed because I had never heard of this one. It was pretty good. The second time I came here, a spokesman from Samuel Adams was there, giving out samples of the Merry MIschief gingerbread beer. Very yummy, and free! He gave us generous samples along with one other type of beer. Cool thing is, they let you order a drink and bring it next door, probably because of the shared ownership. They have some food, too. I believe the menu is different from McGonigal&#39;s, but I think you can also order from next door and eat here as well. Kind of a flip-flop thing. Eat or drink what you want in your destination of choice! There is a front and somewhat hidden back door, which is nice if the front lot is full. Music selection was pretty good; not your typical top 40 mainstream songs. As we were about to leave, one of the workers was drawing/writing a stylish ad on their big chalkboard for a New Years event, I believe. I would really like to go back on a Friday or Saturday night, as I&#39;ve only been there during the week."

You can tell the food is Hine made quality, made from scratch. 

We stared with an order of mini chicken empanadas. You could tell they were freshly made. The green sauce on the table enhanced the flavor.

For my entree I had the beef passion  it&#39;s steak with onions and cheese.  I wish there was more cheese. The Steak came with a side of rice and fresh sliced avocado and tomatoes. 

I wish the food had a bit more flavor, but otherwise an ok meal."

I came here based on great yelp reviews, being from out of town and searching.  The review began by complaining about the strip mall and neighboring businesses.  To be honest, I didn&#39;t finish reading because my food was ready.  I don&#39;t really understand why that review would condescend and not understand that possibly rent may have brought them in and to us that could mean lower prices.  Maybe they went on to compliment and say they deserve to be in a finer space.  

Anyway, I was greeted very warmly, and enjoyed some vibrant latin music while I waited for my Bandeja Paisa.  I wanted to try something truly Colombian.  Well it was absolutely worth &#34;enduring&#34; the strip mall adventure for this delicious food!  Trust me this was no epic climb of the Himalayas nor a maimed crawl through the ghetto.  It was an easy trip to pick up some delicious Colombian beans, rice, egg, skirt steak, chorizo, avocado, and other tidbits of the meal.  Large portion, but not overwhelming.  Simple but tasty"

Had the &#34;taste&#34; plate (truthfully, I don&#39;t remember the name of the dish). It had a bunch of stuff on it that was very tasty.

Yelp something to eat-----DUH!

Went here with hubby the other day.  Didn&#39;t want to go to a chain place (and there are tons in the vicinity).  Saw the other reviews and the interesting looking pics so decided to give this place a try.

Like others noted--this place is small, smaller than tiny, space is premium.  They appear to do a lot of take out and catering/large order type of business.  They have uber yummy fresh fruit juices/smoothies.  We tried the passion fruit and guanabana---both were excellent.  Then we opted for some steamed yuca and garlic as well as the picada.

The yuca was super tasty and flavorful.  The picada had us in meat heaven.  A big ol&#39; tray of meats was super yummy.  I definitely want to go back and try some empanadas as well as some of their other dishes.

What a treat to find someplace in the western suburbs to take me back to my travels and introduce my wife and children to some great Colombian food.  We had an incredible meal of authentic cuisine served by very welcoming staff.   Cannot wait to return.

From the wall decorations to the passionate owner, you&#39;ll have experienced Colombian hospitality and food. 

I went with one other and ordered the Picada, an empanada, fried dough, and a blended fruit juice. The picada was our main course and ordered 2 servings and it was pretty good! All sorts of meats are on there with some tomatoes and rice flour bread. I liked the flavor profiles of the meat but they were a bit tough to chew. Not sure if it&#39;s supposed to be like that, but tasty nonetheless. I really appreciate that there are a lot of sides here that cost a dollar or so because I was able to try out a variety of Colombian dishes. We came near closing time so some of the things ran out, but it&#39;s a good way to enrich your palette on budget! Also, the owner recommended us what she described to be a kiwi-like fruit juice. It was pretty good, however, I felt like there were a bit too much foam left from the blender.

All in all, this was a unique experience for me and it was priced nicely. Hope to be back to try the rice plate dishes!"

It&#39;s cheesy bread made with yucca and corn flour. Absolutely yummy and warm. Also, I got the special. For $7.95, I got rice, beans, chicharron, patacon (flattened plantain), and an agua de panela con limon (Colombian lemonade).

The combination of foods on the plate sort of reminded me of food from Nicaragua. We always have some plantains and some rice/beans and some type of meat. In this case it was the chicharron which is fried pork rind. They make it themselves--it was very flavorful! I loved everything...and the sauce provided (green sauce which I don&#39;t remember the name to). The agua de panela was very delicious with the food! Overall, had a great experience...service was great!

To go, I had more of the pandebono and the arepa con queso (SO GOOD!!). I want to go back. Check this place out!"

There are four tables that can theoretically seat 4 people each. Practically, however, it would be too crowded to eat a sit-down meal here comfortably. If you like a more cozy atmosphere, then the music, fridge and counter give the place an authentic Columbian feel.

I placed an order to go and came to pick it up twenty minutes later when they said it would be ready. They had not even started making my order and I waited inside the restaurant for another 40 minutes. Also, they missed one side (which they didn&#39;t charge me for). This was okay because there was enough for two meals for the price of one meal. That extra desert would have been too much food.

The quality of the food make up for the wait. It was obviously custom-made, completely fresh and delicious. I ordered the Yucca Frita, Steamed Yucca with Garlic, Chicken Empanadas and Plato Mixto. To make up for the wait, they gave me a cheese-filled arepa for free.I appreciated the thought although I could not eat it due to a gluten and dairy allergy. Another reviewer said that most of the food is naturally gluten-free. I would ask them specifically because they told me that their arepas (corn cakes) have gluten.

I highly recommend this place if you don&#39;t mind waiting a while for excellent food."

This place is small but very cozy. It&#39;s also decently priced and the entrees are good portions that will leave you stuffed. The pandebono was so warm and soft with a hint of butter. The soconcho and tamal were huge portions! The arepa con chorizo was my favorite! The chorizo was grilled and the taste was a little sweet and not spicy, just amazing!

I mean, I&#39;m obviously still going to let you know what I think, but it may be way off base is all.

I came here with a friend and immediately got hit with a random stank upon walking in the door.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s some sort of stinky Columbian food I&#39;m unaware of, or it&#39;s the place, but it had me a little worried.  The food and the owners make up for the stank, but still.

The restaurant itself, if you can call it that, is TINY.  Like TEEEEEEENY TIIIIIIIIIIINY.  It has a small bar with 3 or 4 rickety bar stools, a couple of 2 top tables, and one 4 top table.  I would plan on ordering out since you may or may not have a place to sit.     

I got the Bandeja Colombian&#39;s Taste so I can try a little of everything.  It comes with a huge heaping platter-full of white rice (good if you mix it with the beans), beans (kind of plain unless mixed with the aforementioned rice), a fried plantain (HOLY COW YUM), grilled skirt steak (if there is a Heaven, they will serve this there...especially with the homemade hot sauce they give you), pork rinds (good and really porky and nothing like the fried to a crisp air most gringas get in bagged pork rinds), Colombian sausage (again, see also:  Heaven&#39;s menu), a fried egg (meh, too leaky for me), a corn cake (much like what I imagine the elvish bread to taste like...very plain and dense) and a slice of avocado (wish there was more...I love fresh avocado).  Point is, the food is great and fresh and they certainly don&#39;t skimp on the portions.  It wasn&#39;t badly priced either.  

I hope they last.  Being tucked away in this random, surrounded by construction strip mall can&#39;t be good for business, but they seem to be doing well despite these issues.  Owners are ridiculously nice, food is great, and it&#39;s cheap.  I&#39;ll be back for more of that steak and chorizo...I can guarantee that."

This is a Colombian (South American) type of cuisine. As per the pictures on the wall, they offer dishes with Chicken, Beef, pork as well as soups and side dishes which look appetizing. We decided to just try something small to check for taste and quality so we ordered several Beef Turnovers ( empanadas ) to go. They had a good flavor, a bit on the greasy side but that is expected of any deep fried food. They came with a side of Chimichurri ( picante sauce ) which was mild/medium in spiciness. Lets just say we&#39;ll be going back for more ...
Also noticed their daily lunch special for $7.50. It was odd the waiter couldn&#39;t tell us what their lunch special was for the following day. It seems they don&#39;t have a weekly lunch special menu but rather make it up as they go along. The inside is very crammed with I think only 4-5 tables so take out is a good idea especially during the lunch hour.
First impression is positive with at least the empanadas. We would like to try their lunch specials to get a better sense as to quality, flavor and freshness."

It&#39;s a BYOB establishment that has no problem accommodating those that prefer a nice beer or wine with dinner. It&#39;s located on the corner of Lake and 53 in a strip mall. Unless you are looking for it, you will probably drive past it and never know it was there. There are only 6 tables at most, so don&#39;t be surprised if there is no seating. 

I have had dinner there a couple of times and the food is consistently good. Service is also good. The woman who is the owner also waits all the tables herself. Other family members can be seen operating the kitchen. 

Last Sunday we came here with friends for breakfast. It was really more like bread rolls and coffee. The bread was awesome! Like out of this world fresh and awesome. We all know that Colombians take their coffee seriously, so in like fashion they do not disappoint here. The coffee really is delicious. 

For dinner expect to pay $30 to $45 per couple."

I asked for arroz con leche but it was not available.  I asked for the menu again...secretly I wanted arroz con pollo, arepa con queso...but I&#39;d be crazy to eat all that in one night.

Most successful restaurants started off in a small space. 

This place has been in business  for the past 3 years there is a fairly large Colombian population growing there in Itasca even more since the this place opened.
I have to say this place took me by surprise.

When I arrived there was a big family having diner, they were Colombian. 

Ruth is the owner she waited on us. 
She gave us great service and was very attentive. 

I started with the Empanadas I had 4.
They were very tasty, not greasy.
I&#39;m allergic to onions they made them without. I called a day in advance so they could prepare without onions for me. 

I had the steak with rice and  beans, fried Yuca, and steamed Yuca marinated in a garlic sauce and cilantro. 

I had a bowl of fresh green leaf lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and avocado salad I added a dash of fresh lime. Perfecto!

All authentic Colombian Cuisine.
No Preservatives here. it&#39;s the real Deal!

I will be coming back
it&#39;s a drive but worth it. 
it&#39;s easy on the wallet too.

The menu isn&#39;t extensive but I&#39;d rather choose a dish from a category of 10 vs 100. This place is a small mom and pop shop and is doing fairly well. 

I got a sandwich the last time I was here with their potatoes. The sandwich was by no means small and the potatoes were like our potatoes but much starchier. They&#39;re delicious (especially when you dip it in their homemade salsa). 

I have also tried their mini empanadas and I can&#39;t recommend them enough! They&#39;re fully homemade and you can taste it! The outside is absolutely delicious and makes the whole dish!! I ask for an extra large salsa and go to town and these. 

I do have to warn, the salsa is HOT but if you like spicy, it&#39;ll definitely hit the spot!"

I&#39;ve never had colombian fare before, so I do not have anything to compare this to...but if the empanada&#39;s are any indication I have been missing out.  I could eat a meal (or three) just made out of these.  Cornmeal crust filled with perfectly spiced meat.  Yum!!!  I tried the Bandeja sampler while my sister had the Beef Passion, and as much as I liked each of the assortment of meats (particularly the sausage), the grilled avacado and egg clearly cooked in the same grill were loved!

Anyway, the owner is really sweet; she&#39;ll go over the menu with you and ask you what you&#39;re in the mood for. She also gave us a free order of the sweet plantains because she didn&#39;t think they were sweet enough. 

My wife and I are gluten free and pretty much everything they make contains yucca, corn and rice flour. I love their pandebonos and their simple plato mixto, marinated skirt stake and chicken breast, served with white rice, yucca fries and this awesome cilantro-pesto type dipping sauce.

Previously a Cuban restaurant, the tiny hole in the wall serves up some authentic and delicious Colombian cuisine. New to Colombian food, I ventured out with some friends and tried a variety of different dishes. Each platter was exceptional, authentic, and made with organic ingredients. The prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are large. 

::The sampling::
- Beef Passion 
Grilled skirt steak stuffed with cheese, bacon, mushrooms and onions served with white rice and tomatoes

- Tostada Con Todo 
Deep fried plantain served with shredded beef, pork rinds, guacamole, hogao (Colombian style sauce).

- Tamal Tolimense 
An inheritance form the Indian-Colombian culture. A corn cake filled with chicken, pork, beef, potatoes, rice, peas and egg. All wrapped in a banana leaf.

- Empanadas de Carne 
The outer crust is made with precooked cornmeal. The filling is meat, potatoes seasoned with hogao (Colombian style sauce)

- Empanada Vegetariana    
Filling with potatoes and hogao (Colombian style sauce)

- Torta Negra
Authentic chocolate cake

The service was impeccable. The woman behind the counter was extremely friendly and accommodating. She explained (in detail) each of the dishes we were considering, and made recommendations. She provided complimentary Colombian coffee and chocolate cake. Yummmm. 

The one downfall is the size of the restaurant. Unless you&#39;re going with just another person or two, your best bet is carryout. There&#39;s a small bar that seats 3-4, a couple of tabes for 2, and one table for 4. If you&#39;re going with a large party, this wouldn&#39;t be an ideal spot.

I personally enjoy the steak sandwich, the pandebonos and coffe is also very good. The empenadas are a little bland in my opinion but I really don&#39;t know Colombian cuisine so its hard to say, they&#39;re fine once you dip them in the green sauce. 
My only complain is that some items are a little pricey"

So when you stumble on something that completely blowns the mold away, you leap!  Such is Colombian&#39;s Taste.

A few words of caution: don&#39;t show up with 15 of your best friends, because they only seat 14 and that&#39;s wall to wall.  If you need ambiance, not here; you make your own or try down the block. And don&#39;t think about late night feeds, cause they close at 8PM.

But if you want to try authentic, house-made Colombian cusine, get in here!  

Our small group tasted 4 different entrees, passed the mini empanadas-beef and potato goodness wrapped in corn flower and deep fried.  Served with a green salsa-like elixer with some gentle heat in it, they are quite amazing.  The Beef Passion was very tasty; the Arroz con Polla, mild and in need of the green sauce, but authentic because this is a cusine that doesn&#39;t slam you with hot sauces. We sampled the Tamal Tolimense, described as a Indian-Colombian dish with potatoes, beef, egg, rice , chicken, pork rolled in a corn flower torta.  Unique! The least adventurous of us settled for a checken sandwich- a cross between a Cuban and a panini. Reported as good.  Desert was Arroz con Leche; rice pudding with coconut and cinamon.

Ending with Colombian coffee, was just the thing.  Portions are good sized but thankfully not killer, and for you celiacs: this place is just about totally gluten free!  Only the sandwiches and Torta Negra contain wheat!  You absolutely must try the Pandebono! Baked in the back and filled with cheesy, chewy flavor.  Take some home!

In fact, bring a bottle of wine and try everything!  I doubt you will be disppointed."

There is only seating for about 12, and many of the seats were occupied by Colombians gathered around a laptop to watch a soccer game while eating some amazing food. The owner welcomed us warmly and on learning it was our first visit, brought out a sample of Pan de Bono, a delicious cheesy bread made with casava flour. Our server was very helpful in describing the menu selections. (There are also photos of many of the menu items on the wall above the counter.) It was very difficult to decide what to order as everything sounded good! We finally ordered picada for two. This was a huge tray of delicious bite size morsels of chicken, chorizo, chicharon, plantain chips, and fried yuca, served with a mildly spicy green salsa and arepa, a kind of corn cake. 

We sneaked a look at what the other customers were eating, and everything looked very appealing Portions are large but not overwhelming. Prices are reasonable. 

They also have a nice selection of fresh tropical juices, which can be ordered with or without milk. We asked for maracuya (passion fruit) without milk, and it arrived in a very large glass which we shared. Heavenly, and the perfect complement to our entree. 

For dessert, we shared rice pudding and a slice of cake. I think this was the torta negra listed in the menu, but another reviewer described torta negra as a chocolate cake, and this was more of a dark fruit cake, with raisins, coconut, banana and wine. The taste was so dark and rich. 

The women who waited on us were so welcoming and helpful, we really felt like guests in their home. We can&#39;t wait to go back!"

It did not disappoint!  First, we ordered  the pandebono, which was a steamy hot ball of cheesy bread... simply marvelous!  Do not miss this!  Next, we got an additional item (bunuelos or something like that) which was akin to a large hush puppy corn cake thing... kinda sweet, and oh so good!  I ordered the bandeja columbians taste, and my friend ordered the plato mixto.  We sampled each others, and everything was incredible.  Her chicken was excellently marinated, very juicy and perfectly cooked, and the skirt steak was equally as impressive.  The dressing on my friend&#39;s salad was very light and citrusy, which was a perfect accompaniment to everything.  I highly recommend going here, but be aware as this place is quite small.

You know the places; you&#39;ve forgotten more of the names of the places that took up shop in a location than you can remember.  There just seems to be some locations that just don&#39;t work for a business.  Restaurant black-holes, if you will.  I fear that Columbian&#39;s Taste may have opend in a restaurant black hole- I hope not.
I liked the previous restaurant that was in this same location, I believe it was cuban cuisine.  I really liked Columbian&#39;s Taste with my first visit.
The lady behind the counter, whom i can only assume is the owner, asked if this was my first visit and experience with columbian food, and proceeded to be helpful in explaining the menu and what some of the different things are.
I was getting a to go order during my lunch break, so decided to go with the steak sandwich which came with a side of columbian potatoes (which i went with) or fried cassava, and I&#39;d ordered a side of Platano con Queso (sweet plantain with cheese).  I ended up receiving 2 empanadas instead of the cheesy plantains I&#39;d ordered, but was happy with the mistake.  The empanadas were outstanding.  Very nice and crispy cornmeal crust.  mmm.  
The sandwich was a pressed sandwich.  the steak was very flavorful.  A nice, simple sandwich.
The potatoes were nothing special, a basic small yellow nugget potato, i believe boiled and buttered.  
There are many items on the menu I want to try.  I WILL be back.  I hope Columbian&#39;s Taste sticks around."

Los Fernandez was a nice little place with great food at their old location next to the Walgreens across the street.  We paid the new Fernandez, a visit during lunch time.

It is now a huge, cavernous place. Combination night club, bar and restaurant.  It reminded me of one of those massive beer tents in Munich during Oktoberfest, with a touch of Tijuana.

The place was elbow-to-elbow packed even as big as it is.  Good for the owners, bad for customers (unless you like crowds, slow service and excessive noise).

The music (live), extremely loud.  So loud, it was hard to hear myself think, even less being able to hear the waiter and simply impossible to have a conversation.

The quality of the food itself  went down several notches.   The service, below par.

Will never set foot there again.  Not my scene.  But maybe you will like it.  Judge for yourself."

About two weeks ago, my boyfriend and I came here and he ordered menudo for his hangover only to be disappointed in how the menudo wasn&#39;t cleaned good enough and still had a lot of fat on it. He even told me this was the worst he&#39;s ever had. Although his experience wasn&#39;t pleasant, I still enjoyed my camarones a la Diabla and caldo de camaron. 

Today though was our first time having take out and I was actually pretty excited. It was all excitement for nothing to put it nicely. Got camarones a la diabla (my favorite dish) only to be disappointed, they were overcooked and mine were barely spicey. On top of that it wasn&#39;t saucey like it normally is, and the shrimps weren&#39;t cleaned good enough.
We ordered a few other things as well and they were poorly made.

To drink we got 3 Jamaica waters and they were very sweet today, another let down.

Our bill came out to 51$ and I couldn&#39;t stress enough how disappointed I was and what a waste of money it was as well. And to think the boyfriend and I were thinking about taking our families here....

Called the manager and let him know about our awful experience and he was very kind in me being able to notify him on these mistakes, as he would talk with his kitchen staff , and told me to give this place another opportunity but I&#39;m not quite sure that will happen any time soon..."

It was a fail and we got hungry so we ended up here.
   As soon as we walk in they had the restaurant on the right side with a small bar in the back and karaoke. Then on the left side they had a room with music and dancing! And it was Mexican music! I would have never imagined this small business in a strip mall had that. The cover fee was 10 dollars but they were closing in an hour so we just went to eat on the restaurant side. Which is why we originally went in. But now we now next time instead of trying running out everywhere this place is here and it really looked fun! I caught a glimpse of the dance floor. 
    I was going to do karaoke but I chickened out! Lol. I just ordered some fries I was not in the mood for a big plate that late. Food did look good so next time I will like to come early to dance and then go eat.
   I did not give them them 2 extra stars because the waitress did have a lil attitude and the girls up by the dance floor did too but I tend to ignore those things. But customer service is always a must specially when your customers are being nice and have smile."

(Reposting/Updating this review, because they moved, and the old page doesn&#39;t come up anymore).

I had just gone to Hartland, WI and ate at some random Mexican joint there that I had been raving to all my friends about how I had the best Mexican food in some super podunk town in Wisconsin. Granted, I had tried something new there, so it may have been that it wasn&#39;t the restaurant itself, but just the dish. The dish was Bistec a la Mexicana. Sounds like &#34;biscuit&#34; but the description said steak so I got it. I&#39;ll explain later, but that was the whole reason why I came to this place...to try out Bistec a la Mexicana to see if I&#39;d like it here. Well..

BISTEC A LA MEXICANA
No. I didn&#39;t like it. It tasted and looked NOTHING like what I had out in Hartland! It was bland, not spicy, and just disappointing. Now, maybe the Wisconsin version of it was the American way and this was the authentic way, who knows. Whatever the case was, this wasn&#39;t what I wanted.

CHIPS &amp; SALSA TRIO
After having been so disappointed that the closest sit down Mexican joint near work had bad Bistec, what kept us coming back was the Chips &amp; Salsa. The chips are freshly fried, and sometimes a bit greasy, but they are usually hot, fresh, and oh so crunchy (my favorite)! The chips by themselves are just amazing, but then there&#39;re the 3 salsas. There&#39;s a creamy green one (tomatillo I think), a red-orange one, and a chunky red one. When we go (2 of us), we end up eating 2 baskets of chips. In that time, I probably dunk 1 chip in the red-orange, 2 chips in the chunky red, and the rest in the green. I can&#39;t quite explain it, because all 3 salsas are unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had. The orange has this reeeeeeeeeeeealy faint tangyness to it. Nothing that&#39;ll make you salivate or anything, but it&#39;s just a little weird. The red chunky looks like Tostitos or something, but it&#39;s actually a bit sweeter than that, and lacks salt. It&#39;s ok, but just pales in comparison to the green one. The consistency is thicker than the others, but nowhere near guacomole. If you spooned it on your plate, it would definitely not keep its shape. The best part, is that it&#39;s sometimes got a real healthy kick to it, which puts me in this like blood thirsty mode where I start devouring chips unknowingly! It&#39;s great stuff! If it wasn&#39;t for these, we would&#39;ve stopped coming after the first day.

LOMO EN CHILI DE ARLBOL
...and I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t stop, because eventually I stumbled across this. No idea what the name means (something about a forest chili?), but THIS is what Bufu, WI&#39;s Bistec looked like. It&#39;s thin slices of steak in a spicy red sauce, along with rice and beans. The flavor is just perfect! The spice varies day to day, but it never disappoints, and sometimes it&#39;s really cookin and I break into a downpour of sweat...but I love it! It&#39;s hot too (temperature-wise). I&#39;m not a tortilla fan, so I usually neglect those completely. I&#39;ll basically scoop some of the beef/sauce/veggies (the dish is light on veggies...i like that) on the rice and just eat it like that. OMG It&#39;s so delicious! Now, I successfully finished a ghost-chili wings challenge, so that&#39;ll give you some idea of my spice tolerance, and this dish can, at times, give me a run for my money, but then again, sometimes, I won&#39;t even break a sweat. Just be careful if you&#39;re not used to spicy things. There is the faintest bit of tang in the sauce too, but nothing like the orange salsa. It&#39;s seasoned well, and the steak is cooked perfectly everytime. This is my favorite dish here!

TACOS
When coworkers and I feel like being healthy-but not too healthy, we come here for the lunch special tacos. It&#39;s a great deal! $5.25 for 2 tacos (any kind), rice, beans, and bottomless chips &amp; salsa trio. The $5.25 is almost good just with the chips! I order my tacos with onions and cilantro instead of the lettuce, tomato, etc. Their chicken is about as good as any other chicken taco I&#39;ve had, so I&#39;m not sure how that rates. I&#39;ve had a lot of their tacos, but the best ones were the Carne Asada and Al Pastor. The Carne Asada steak is great! The steak is packed with flavor, smokey and garlic/herb-y. The Al Pastor is so good! The red sauce that it&#39;s marinaded in has a peppery taste and has the perfect balance of salt to make it one irresistible taco!

FAJITAS
I hope I have room. The steak in that taco is the center stage in the fajitas, and that&#39;s why it gets 10/10. I&#39;ve never had such good steak in a fajita...

CHILE RELLENO
Their poblanos are big, beautifully egg battered, and the perfect amount of cheese to not overpower the whole thing, but give it so much buttery goodness that only chihuahua cheese can provide! Also, you definitely taste the poblano, but it&#39;s not that strong. I&#39;m not a huge pepper fan, so that&#39;s perfect for me.

But today I needed to kill time while tires were installed at the nearby NTB, so an opportunity presented to give it a try. 

The large dining room was sparsely populated today at lunch time. That made for excellent service from a friendly waiter.  The menu had a lot of typical Mexican dishes that you would expect to find.  I didn&#39;t notice anything that I hadn&#39;t seen before.  And that was fine with me. 

Freshly made chips with three kinds of sauce were offered while I looked at the menu.  The chips and sauce were quite satisfactory. 

I ordered the tacos with rice and beans.  More types of filling were available than the usual beef or chicken.  I ordered the chorizo sausage.  The food arrived more quickly than I expected.  It was hot and delicious! 

I found the entire meal and ambience quite pleasing as a lunch location.  Perhaps I will be back this way sometime for dinner."

I was surprised how big the place is, they certainly have plenty of tables &amp; booths, plus a bar area, to accommodate a crowd.  They had live music which, although the singer/keyboard player was very good, the volume was WAY too loud for 6 p.m. - even if it was a Friday night it&#39;s not like they are a nightclub.  The hubs &amp; I had to yell at one another across the booth to hear one another - same goes with the waitress - so we weren&#39;t really off to a great start.

They have a huge menu and everything sounded quite good.  I had the Cuban sandwich, which was HUGE.  It tasted good &amp; the bread was great, but other than the various meats (of which there were plenty) the other fillings were more pilled right in the middle of the sandwich &amp; not spread out so I rearranged the fillings a bit for better coverage.  The sandwich doesn&#39;t come with a side but it was so big that wasn&#39;t an issue as I only ate half and took the rest home (they do have various sides a la carte if you feel so inclined).  The Hubs had the Enchiladas Suizos platter (chicken) which he said was just average.  Their free chips &amp; 3 assorted salsas were quite good (2 of the 3 salsas are spicy so if you don&#39;t like spicy there is 1 for you).

Our server seemed pleasant enough (aside from us all having to yell at one another over the music) but she wasn&#39;t very attentive. She came over once right after our food was delivered to ask how it was and then disappeared.  Our sodas &amp; waters were never refilled at all so we basically stopped eating when we realized she was no where to be seen and had been sitting with empty glasses for 10 minutes.  After sitting another 10 minutes and still not seeing our server we finally flagged down another server after a few attempts at getting someone&#39;s attention &amp; asked for boxes, mentioning we have no idea where our server went (in all I&#39;d say she was gone for 30 minutes). Our actual server came back a minute later with boxes &amp; apologized and we asked for the check and left cash so we could get the heck out of there as we had other errands to run."

We eat dinner elsewhere and came here for dessert and drinks. Place was not very busy. We ordered cheesecake and fried ice cream. 45 mins later our dessert was still MIA!

I decided to call in the dessert order from our table on my cell phone and see if take-out was quicker. Within minutes the waitress came by with an attitude and claimed &#34; we are making your birthday dessert:&#34;

1. Thanks for ruining my friends surprise for my birthday
2. I wasn&#39;t aware they make the cheese cake fresh to order. 

5 minutes later a pre-sliced cheesecake bathed (drowned) in caramel &amp; chocolate sauce arrived at our table. 

They did sing happy birthday to me, which was nice, but I would not recommend this restaurant, the service is sub-prime and could not enjoy the dessert due to the drowning sauce."

I thought the food was amazing. It could be people just don&#39;t know what to order here. Ive only had the takeout food here so this review is only based on take out food and not the ambience and service. 

My landscaper was working in my yard when i happened to be doing spring cleaning in the garage. I ended up giving him so many electronics and household items he brought me food from Los Fernandez and it was amazing. When he asked me what i wanted i said something about burritos and tacos and he refused. He got me what he got for himself which was &#34;camarones al mojo&#34; and a bunch of drinks. The tortillas was great. The salsas were tasty too.  He said entrées are the way to go. 

Tip: he said the Elmhurst location is great for rotisserie chicken."

Common in many Mexican restaurants, the chips arrived shortly after we were seated.  The chips, oily and no taste.

The server, we saw her only once when she took our order.

Our order arrived promptly, served by someone else other than our server.

My wife took two bites of her meal and could not eat anymore.  I however was able to take about five bites and had to stop.  The meals were so terrible which could explain the lack of our server returning to check on how we were doing.  The beans were cold, the beef and chicken, cannot even describe the terrible taste.

The entertainer was good, but too loud for the size of the restaurant.

Unfortunately I had to track down a server to get our check without any consideration from them when she saw our uneaten meals.

Taco Bell would be a better choice."

Big mistake. At 9:30 at night karaoke was going on which was extremely loud and impossible to carry a conversation with any of our guests or the servers. Service was good. Two ladies worked our party and they were hopping. The food was only so-so. The portions were not large at all. My son&#39;s plate had about 2 tablespoons of beans which is his favorite part. He did not eat his cheese quesadilla or the rice and I know he was starving. Because of how loud it was, I was not able to ask anyone else how their food was. 
The servers asked for the names of the bride and groom and I think that the DJ said some kind of congratulations, but I don&#39;t understand Spanish. The servers brought over 2 giant sombreros for the bride and groom and sang a song to the tune of &#34;happy birthday &#34;. Then it was &#34;Shot, Shot&#34;, with some kind of red liquor. The bride refused because she recently had surgery and does not drink. They also put 2 beautiful little cakes in front of the bride and groom while they sang the song.
When the check came, I was shocked to see that they charged 9.99 for each of those 2 cakes. 20.00 for 2 cakes that we didn&#39;t order? Probably  one 9.99 cake would have been fine for them to share. We would have not ordered any cake because my daughter-in-law is gluten free. They should have asked first. I was pretty outraged how they could just bring it without asking and then charge you for it. 
Also, on the check was an 18% gratuity added on which is fine with me for a large party and is to be expected. But the part that says 18% service charge is covered up by a written in &#34;thank you&#34; from the servers. I think that they were being sneaky and trying to get double tipped. I was going to leave extra money but that right there turned me off.
We chose Los Fernandez because a few in our party are gluten free and thought they would have some good options for them. My husband and I didn&#39;t want to make a scene in front of our new inlaws-to-be, so we paid the check. I wish that I would have kept a copy to see if they charged for water or anything else like some reviewers said. When we signed the charge slip, our copy of the bill was missing. They should give that to you.
Oh well...lesson learned... we&#39;ll never be back!"

We asked if they could sing to my grandson. the waitress brought a small cake for about 2 pieces. ..when the bill came it was outrageous.

The bill was nearly $200.00. They charged $10.00 for the cake,Other restaurants it&#39;s complimentary. The bill was padded and tip was added.

Who in their life has ever heard of ordering guacamole for an appetizer and not receiving chips? Especially to go. I had to go to the gas station next to my office to buy a bag of chips to go with my meal. Guacamole wasn&#39;t awful, but certainly not the best. Secondly, my lengua tacos had onions on them, no tomatoes to be found. Tacos themselves were bland, bland, bland and the lengua was incredibly rubbery.

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this restaurant since I noticed they moved to this new location. Finally had the chance to stop there for a late lunch on a weekday and I was very disappointed. The place was empty except for a couple in a corner booth. No music playing but a soccer game was on the TV in the background. I ordered the Pollo Encacahuatado (Chicken in a spicy Peanut Sauce), one of their Lunch Specials, and an ice tea. I got my ice tea, which was not that large, and I finished it before the food arrived. Someone other than the waiter that took my order brought the food to my table and then left without asking if I wanted a refill. I figured I would ask the waiter when he comes around. He never did. I eat my meal without anything to drink (no water was served). The portion was very small, three thin strips of chicken with barely enough sauce to cover, a cup of Mexican rice, and some beans. The sauce did not taste of peanut, (I doubt there was any there) and it was very salty. (Great and I had nothing to drink!) About 10 minutes after I finished the meal (I was hungry otherwise I would have left it) he comes walking by. I called him over, (it was obvious he was not going to stop by the table), and asked for the check. He came back with it and left it on the table without asking about the meal or if there was anything else he could get me, etc. He never came back to collect the check and payment. I had to take it to the front counter and wait for him to appear again. I left no tip and he did not ask."

Husband and I went on a Friday night a day before Valentines Day. As soon as we walked in the service was horrible. I ordered camarones al mojo de ajo and it was disgusting. The shrimps were not fresh with no flavor, no where near tasting like mojo de ajo. The vegetables were undercooked and the rice tasted like it was last night&#39;s rice. My husband ordered a steak  burrito  and he said it was plain and not enough steak and ingredients in it. We had ordered these plates before so not sure what went wrong, we think that they changed their chef.

We used to frequent Los Fernandez for dinner at their old location both dining in and ordering via drive-thru, and sadly after dining at their new location we more than likely will not return. The quaint, cozy and ethnic feel of the old building has now been replaced with a generic strip-mall restaurant with fancier decor that does not feel even authentically Mexican as well as wide-screen tvs for events. The food quality has lessened and service was mediocre, slow and annoying (due to the fact that we were repeatedly invited/pressured to come and watch an advertised boxing match that weekend even after we informed them politely we were not interested, and were even questioned further as to why we wouldn&#39;t come). It very much seems the focus has been changed to their late night crowds as those evenings seem to be the only time the parking lot is full unlike before at their old location."

It only takes 10 mins to get from Popeyes to my house so I doubt it&#39;s because of the drive that my food would be so cold. 
It surprised me how I ordered at the drive thru and they didn&#39;t box any of my food. They just put the chicken, fries, and biscuit in a paper tray with no lid or cover, and stuffed it in a paper bag.

The chicken is fresh, crispy, absolutely Southern chicken done right.  The Beans and rice are to die for.  I do wish they would put in less salt but it&#39;s creamy and delicious.  Service is fast but we always do take out.

No other chicken can compare.  We&#39;ve gone there about a dozen times (or more) and never have had a bad experience.   We always get the chicken breasts because they are really nice big pieces.  One chicken breast will fill you up.   We have looked at the other pieces offered and they look good as well.  We just prefer breasts.

Never greasy.  Breading is exceptional.

The mash potatoes and gravy are super.  

The biscuits are fresh, flaky and just like Grandma on the farm use to make.

The Fish Po&#39;Boy sandwich is miles ahead of the golden arches.  Really good sandwich. 

We have the money to go to really nice restaurants that are tooted as &#34;excellent&#34; but we always seem to drift back to Popeye&#39;s.

I don&#39;t understand the bad reviews we were there a few days ago and as before everything was excellent.  No I&#39;m not paid to review this (wish I were) nor do I work there.

Okay, now that that&#39;s out of the way, I HATE this location!! I don&#39;t know why I keep letting them get me, but I&#39;ve learned my lesson and I&#39;m done with them.  

The issue is the service. I almost always use the drive-thru and I almost always order something that&#39;s supposed to come with a special sauce. 

See, I love my sauces, so I discuss ad nauseum with the drive-thru person about what kind I want and how many. They always nod and agree and pretend to take note of my request, and then when I get my food and pull off and get down the street (or get home) there are NO SAUCES TO BE FOUND.

Now, I know what you&#39;re going to say...&#34;why don&#39;t yous check your bag before yous pull off?&#34; Well, I do DO that sometimes and I always look and feel inside and think I feel them, but when I realize they&#39;ve bamboozled me again, it&#39;s too late. One time I actually did notice before I left the lot (had already pulled well away from the drive-thru window) and I squeeled my car right back around to the window (had to wait for one car to leave) and said &#34;remember me? we talked about sauces, but there are no sauces...can you give me my sauces?&#34; Got them and then squeeled off again. Ugh.

I mean, let&#39;s go back to my 3rd blurb above: I discuss AD NAUSEUM -- which means to a great length/degree - about what I want, and then they turn around (snickering, I presume), and say &#34;yeah right.&#34;

Ok, I&#39;m done. But that just really fires me up...the carelessness of it all. I&#39;m willing to travel extra distances to go to the other location in Bloomingdale exclusively now because I&#39;ve never had issues the several times I&#39;ve been to that one.

Luv that chicken from popeye&#39;s! I can say that no other fried chicken can compare to popeye&#39;s spicy fried chicken. The cajun spices adds the perfect zest to the crunchy fried skin. Service here is always fast through the drive through or in store. Given the heavy volume, the chicken is always piping hot from the fryer. Also the weekly coupons in the local tribune mailer get you bargain prices for 8 piece meal. Also you can&#39;t go wrong with throwing in a side of cajun fries (large) of course.

Pro- best fast food fried chicken, good pricing with coupon

Con- so many calories so little time

Hidden deal- Weekly chicago trib ad for coupon savings, don&#39;t pay full price ever."

The usually creamy, cheesy Mac and cheese has been bland and less than creamy. The spicy chicken has fallen short too. Not enough crispy, crunchy breading. More mushy, fatty chicken.

And then after being pie pushers, they forgot to give me my son&#39;s soda. Plus getting BBQ sauce and honey is like pulling teeth for some reason.

They close at 11 pm, yet all the warming drawers were turned off (we walked in at 8:40 pm) and cleaned, all the chicken was held, piled so high it couldn&#39;t possibly stay hot (two trays piled easily 5-6&#34; high full of chicken--hmm, wonder who was taking home chicken tonight after close....???), under the same lamps as the fries, biscuits and above a few marinators. They didn&#39;t even *start* cooking parts of our order until well after ten minutes had passed. Zero management or direction. To add insult to injury, once the kid finished getting together our order (finally!) not even so much as a &#34;thank you,&#34; &#34;have a nice night,&#34; or &#34;sorry for the wait.&#34; He couldn&#39;t wait to go be a part of the gossiping group.

Popeye&#39;s Chicken is up there with the best of the best as far as fast food chicken is concerned. I do not normally eat at many fast food chains, but when you want a quick, juicy, hot, meaty piece of chicken, you can drive right past stinky KFC and hit up Popeye&#39;s. 

Now, I can name about 30+ other places to go for good fried chicken, but this Popeye&#39;s is probably one of my faves! Don&#39;t bother driving thru- &#34;they **** you at the drive through! (Joe Pesci once said)&#34; and it&#39;s true. It&#39;s worth getting off your butt and going in to get your food. If you are polite, and patient, they normally will make fresh fries for you and make sure to check your order before you leave. It never fails that if you don&#39;t check, its the time they missed something. 

I think it&#39;s silly to charge for honey, but yes, Popeye&#39;s does. Usually not at this location. Hell, if you ask for some honey, they&#39;ll grab a fist full and toss them in the bag. 

We love going for $2.99 Tuesdays- 2 pieces of chicken (white or dark meat), a side and delicious buttery biscuit for $2.99! My kinda of quickie dinner out while running errands.

You can also grab a 10 lb. bag of ice for $.99.

Skip the onion rings- they are greasy and non-appetizing.

But everything I HAVE had has been amazing. They sell an artichoke dip that will knock your socks off, wash them, dry them, fold them neatly and put them away for you. Don&#39;t go in thinking it&#39;s the usual spinach-artichoke dip you can get any every restaurant in America. No sir. This is a hot creamy dip with a little tiny kick (ala baby Chuck Norris) that will make you happy in places of which we won&#39;t speak. They sell it by the quart or a smaller size for your first try. The buffalo fingers are hugemongous and are a fantastic appetizer/meal. 

I enjoy their thin crust and double-dough pizza. I&#39;m weird, but I love me some meatballs on my pizza. It&#39;s ridonk and I would like you to stop laughing and maybe branch out and try it. Maybe Mikey will likey. I can&#39;t really comment on their deep-dish, because I don&#39;t usually order that style. But I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s amazeballs. 

Just so you know, they are carry out or delivery only. So you can eat your artichoke dip in the privacy of your own home. Turn the lights down low, pipe in the Barry White and go to town. You&#39;re welcome."

Wings were great, wrap was good, it got a little wet when some of the insides fell out, but it happens.

That was a bit of a bummer, but the service was polite and its smelled great and looked clean so we decided to try again some other time.

During a week night we ordered a small 12&#34; pizza with pepperoni and green pepper and half the pizza also had onions and black olives. The pizza was delicious. The pepperoni was crispy with a bit of spice to it which was a pleasant surprise. the onions and green peppers were crisp and plentiful. They also did a good job keeping the onions and black olives on half the pizza. The crust was thin and crispy which was great. The sauce was lean, but I prefer it that way and there were chunks of tomato. 

I will definitely be eating here again."

Well, this isn&#39;t it anymore! 
After the original location was torn down, a new Slice has been established in the strip mall that now sits there. I don&#39;t know if these are the same owners, (I never even had the pizza at the original!) but this is strictly a take-out/delivery pizza place: just a counter and a kitchen in the back. 
As far as the food is concerned, I&#39;ve stopped there a couple times to pick up. I first checked out their menu on-line, it&#39;s your typical pizza with some signature pizzas. It also has an interesting selection of pasta choices and some appetizers you wouldn&#39;t think of. 
The last time I ordered from there, I got the calamari and the mussels in white sauce for an appetizer with the spinach salad, a personal pan pizza for my son, and a meat lovers pizza for my boyfriend. The crust on the pan pizza was dry and crumbly. The spinach salad said it had cranberries, goat cheese, and walnuts, it was almost all spinach-no cheese and a couple cranberries and walnuts. I was heartbroken...until I had the mussels. They were delicious! The next time I ordered from there, I asked for bread on the side for the sauce they came with. The calamari was ok, that sort of dish isn&#39;t made for travel because by the time I got it home, it was soggy. As far as the pizzas, they&#39;re pretty good, but nothing I&#39;d crave. I would be interested in trying one of the pasta dishes next time...and I&#39;m definitely ordering the mussels again!"

It&#39;s not too far from where we live so we decided to give it a shot the next evening. We ordered cheese sticks and a deep dish pizza. When we initially got there, they forgot about the cheese sticks so I had to wait ten minutes for them to make it. He said they wanted it to be fresh for me, that&#39;s why they waited. I never asked for it to be fresh. I just wanted to be in and out. The pizza was horrible. There was not enough cheese, and as soon as you picked a slice up, the crust broke it in half. I&#39;ve never had worse pizza in my life. They DO NOT even come close to comparing to Giordanos or Gino&#39;s East. It should just be called a pan pizza. I decided to call and give them some feedback. I was not expecting any type of compensation as I was not planning on going back. The guy who picked up and took my complaint was very nice. He told me I could not speak to the manager because the manager was busy. After hearing about my horrible experience, he told me to give them another chance and call back whenver I wanted to and the manger would take care of me. Three weeks later, I decided to try the thin crust pizza. I called the manager and told him what happened and he just didn&#39;t care. He said I have no proof something went wrong, there was no credit in the system. He couldn&#39;t just &#34;give me a free pizza.&#34; I never asked for that, the employee offered when I called earlier. He did not even bother with a discount. He kept implying that I was lying by saying they would have fixed the problem right away or that I should have brought it back right away, not three weeks later. He obviously didn&#39;t understand I was doing what the employee told me to do. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone.  This place has horrible pizza but even worse customer service."

In terms of food, I&#39;d say Fratellos is definitely above average.  Good Hot Dogs and Beef Sandwiches.  The fries seem to be missing something, but are serviceable.

Issues I have with Fratellos is they have what I call Portillo&#39;s pricing without the quality/service that is expected at the price they charge.  10-20% off prices would make much more attractive of an option and cause me to come here more regularly.

It is outdated, run down and cramped on the inside.  Personally, I don&#39;t mind a greasy spoon if the food is good, but Fratello&#39;s failed here as well.

We ordered a couple of hot dogs, French fries and onion rings.  The hot dogs were some of the most bland that I have ever tasted.  Imagine a hot dog that sat in water for about 2 hours before you ate it.....just rubbery and no flavor whatsoever.  I added sweet peppers to mine, and they must have been bathing in the same fluid as the hot dogs.  They were cold, and had zero taste.

The kicker.....was the overpricing.  5 hot dogs, onion rings and fries with a drink was $25.  I can eat at a joint like Tommy&#39;s in Crystal Lake and spend half that on the same order and get food that is at least better tasting.

I hope the owners of Fratellos read this and make a change with this person in a managerial position. 

GiGi, you need to shadow YOUR co-workers and learn what GOOD customer service is. You should probably start with your subordinates  first, since they left a better impression than you as the manager.

The first time I went, I ordered a bunch of the Parmesan Garlic wings and fries and had BREAAAAAAAAAAATH for days.  My sister had to go buy a tongue scraper because the BREATH (yes, it deserved all capitals...this is serious) would not go away.  I was also not a fan of the fries.  (WHAT IS THIS? SUGAR!?!)  However, I have come full circle.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  I really think it is my favorite of all the wing places in the land.  Here&#39;s why-
1.  The hot sauce is delicious.  Typical, but delicious.  (No, it is not as good as the Spicy Garlic sauce at BWW, BUT you can buy the BWW sauce and use it at home to not have to deal with the clientele and service.  So there.)
2.  The clientele is not bad.  I&#39;m pretty neutral here.
3.  The fries, once you get used to the sugar, are downright delicious too.  Hand-cut, fried perfectly, and tasty as all hell.
4.  The bleu cheese is the best around.  Hooters and BWW have nothing on this sauce.  (It does give you BREATH though.  Watch out.  And get a tongue scraper.)
5.  You can get dry rubs or sauces on the wings, boneless wings, or strips, or you can get it on the side.  My favorites are Hot, Lousiana Rub, and the dreaded Parmesan Garlic.
6.  It is cheap, you don&#39;t have to tip (I&#39;m not cheap, but it&#39;s nice to have a meal under $20), and the employees take care of you.
7.  You can order online.  Keep it simple.  

The only complaint I have with this place is that there are no knives.  I&#39;m not a savage, damnit.  I require more utensils than a fork, but I make do."

But I am not a fan. I come here like every 6 months since they opened this location but I think it&#39;s time to cut my losses

A lot of people rave about Wingstop but I am not impressed. The wings are always completely over-cooked. The meat near the bones are crispy. Normally the skin should be crispy but juice meat. But no here... the meat is also crispy. 

The wings are either going to be very salty or barely sauced. There is no middle ground here, only the two extremes. 

I recent got an order of Spicy Korean Q. These wings had almost no sauce on them. I had to make a quick Korean BBQ sauce in order to enjoy my wings. If I had to make a sauce then there was no reason to order from here. I should of just stopped my Jewel or Meijers to get raw chicken wings at that point. Today there was like at least 6 people there. Don&#39;t know how they can ruin wings with that many people. Overall, the wings are either gonna be a miss or a complete miss. At least the other wing restaurants can make their wings more consistent. 

The only thing I like about this wing place is that the employees are always friendly and you can order using an app. But that is it."

Anyways, stumbled upon here and ordered the boneless wings. Got the cajun and hot bbq. Talk about SUPER SUPER SUPER salty! They should have been called the salt and salt chicken. I ordered these togo and it would have been nice if they labeled which was which. Unfortunately, I had to guess, and I can&#39;t tell you which tasted better. I can tell you again, it doesn&#39;t really matter, as they were so damn salty, it was ridiculous.

Also, I ordered a side of regular fries. The fries were soggy from the get-go. No crisp here. And I know they can do crisp because the boneless wings were crispy (and did I mention salty?).

Anyways, if you&#39;re looking for wings, stick to B-Dubs -- they got more flavors, better selection, lots of TVs, and a great beer selection. Anyways, this review isn&#39;t for BWW, so I digress."

I came here and got a 30 piece of boneless.  3 sauces only?  And charge you for more sauces?  To top it off, the chicken wasn&#39;t even well sauced.  It&#39;s like they threw some sauce on top and rolled the dice to see if it actually covered the entire chicken.  And if it didn&#39;t, well, too bad. 

I was able to get a sample of the habanero mango sauce.  This isn&#39;t as hot as BW3, it&#39;s similar in heat to BW3 asian chili.  Not bad though.  I&#39;m surprised I was able to get a free sauce though since they nickle and dime you over everything else.

Celery/Carrots?  Extra.
Ranch/Blue Cheese? Extra.
Ketchup?  Well ketchup is free lol.

Not kid friendly, as in they don&#39;t have anything for kids, and don&#39;t even have small cups with lids.  Ok, they have free refills though.

The fries are interesting with a dusting of sugar on top.  They are hand cut and fresh it seems, and I did like them.

All in all, it was a little annoying to have to pay for all the sides, but I guess that&#39;s their business model.  The wings seemed ok, but nothing spectacular.

The service was good and they seemed to get a good bit of traffic so that&#39;s good for them.  But I dunno if I will pick this place over BW3.

Oh, one thing, the teriyaki came out late so we did get some extra chicken so that was nice.

I will try bone in and some other flavors next time and see if it&#39;s better."

Today I went over lunch to try some boneless wings. They&#39;re having a special Louisiana hot rub for a limited time, and with 6 boneless wings I could only have one rub. In retrospect, I think I might have been able to give a higher grade with a different selection, but... this is what it was.

The fries were quite good. Freshly cut potatoes with the right amount of salt. Wonderful with ketchup.

The wings were hit-or-miss, and mostly miss. Since it was just the rub I had ranch on the side, because it seemed like a good idea. It&#39;s a good thing I got the ranch. One or two of the wings were juicy and tender. The rest were overcooked, or had too much breading, or were otherwise just not palatable. (Pro tip: Don&#39;t serve me the big-ass crunchy bits.) Perhaps that&#39;s why they drown other selections in sauce?

Problem is, this seems to be a recurring issue. The last time I went here I had the exact same feelings about their wings. Maybe the bone-in wings are better. Maybe, I&#39;ll try them, if there is a next time."

To make it even better when we paid we used a credit card so he asked to see a license, no problem. Until he &#34;misplaced it&#34; I asked for my license back and he argued with me that he had given it back for a good ten minutes, I literally had to empty my whole purse and wallet to convince him he hadn&#39;t given it back. Where was it? Underneath the receipt printer. 

Their boneless wings are actually chicken strips. They also put sugar on their fries. My friend ordered parmesan garlic boneless wings, they were chicken strips soaked in melted butter with grated parmesan cheese, disgusting.

I heard a lot of hype about this place but I really don&#39;t understand it. The food was bad and the service was terrible."

I tried all the flavors here and nothing beats the lemon pepper wings.  The lemon pepper wings are the only ones that come crispy.  Personally, I don&#39;t care too much for wings that are soft and soggy with sauce.  I like my wings crispy and juicy.  By the way, do not forget the ranch dipping sauce with your lemon pepper wings, it does make a big difference."

My husband and I were craving Hooter&#39;s but we weren&#39;t up to the long drive, so we started checking online for a new wing place to try (since Buffalo Wild Wings sucks). We found this place and ordered a 10-piece of the Original Hot. We were pleasantly surprised by the flavor. Plus there were actually 12 pieces in our order which was nice. Without having them side-by-side with Hooter&#39;s I&#39;d be hard pressed to say which is better."

 We have orderd their famous rib tips, pizza, chicken wings and the beefy cheesy calzone. The cuality of food is really good. It always tastes fresh and of great flavor. This is one of the our favorite places to get our lunch from.

Prices are average.

Been to the city and had the slice deal when out there a few times since and the quality of the pizza at the Carol Stream location is just better all around. They also charge 50¢ extra for the Fuze iced tea that is so damn good with the slice. The times the slices weren&#39;t on point as they usually are should not detract that the slices are damn good when done right and with the consistent standard that I&#39;m used to at the Carol Stream location. It&#39;s not as big as before and then you needed to buy an extra pop. But it&#39;s still fairly big slice even though I might have to head back later for another slice.

This location is easily the best of all the Papa Ray&#39;s locations in Chicago and the vicinity. And by far has the best slices and slice deal in the far western suburbs when done to their usual standard.

If you need a good slice. This is the ONLY place around 10 mile radius that the slices are good enough to warrant selling slices and not having to commit to a whole pie."

We used the trusty yelp app to locate some wings when everyone here was dying for some. Of course we had to get a pizza too and a salad for me.

The pizza was good but still didn&#39;t beat our favorite spot. The wings were FABULOUS said the boys. Good size and plenty of flavor. I got a salad with feta cheese, olives and artichoke hearts. It was big and great.

So not a home run here but a great triple and we will be getting more wings soon!"

Today I found my self driving in the area with a friend  and I told him that I had just received a menu with coupons and noticed that this place had a few locations in the city.

I also informed them that the place had pretty good lunch specials. So we gave it a shot. The food was ok nothing special and too hot, must of been straight out of the oven. However, the problem wasnt the ok food, but rather the lady working the front counter. Let&#39;s just say she has absolutely no customer service skills. She doesn&#39;t know how to affectedly communicate with customers. She would swear and simply act like their was no customers in the building. While we were eating our lunch she approached us and said are you guys done with this trash? I guess that was our clue to leave so we said yes and left. Will I return back? Probably not unless they have a really good deal and its delivery."

He steps out in the front to smoke in the middle of his shift with NO ONE in the front. So when people walk in he puts it out and goes in. You smell like smoke and your handling people&#39;s food. I just think it&#39;s gross. Also, I was told it would be a ten minute wait which really ended up being 20 minutes--while I was on lunch. Disappointed with this place more and more every visit."

I was in the area one day &amp; was not quite sure where to eat &amp; some how I ventures off of the beaten path &amp; ended up here at Papa Ray&#39;s.  This restaurant is in a little strip mall center in the middle of a neighborhood.  

Pulling up I noticed that they had a few little benches set up outside so that you could have the option to eat outside.  When I walked in the first thing I noticed was that the inside of the restaurant was very clean &amp; updated.  They had a big selection of drinks &amp; sodas in the cooler &amp; they even had some of the best hot sauce for sale.  I was recommended to try the $5 slice of pizza.  I have had a $5 slice of pizza at other restaurants &amp; it was just a normal slice of pizza.  However the slice of pizza that they give you here could possibly be used as a blanket because it was a gigantic portion &amp; then some.  The most important part though is that the pizza was awesome.  It wasn&#39;t just a big slice of pizza, it was a big slice of pizza that was good.    

Another one of their weekly specials is they discount their wings.  The wings here are also delicious.  They say that the wings are award winning &amp; I actually believe that because they were very good.  The staff here has always been nice &amp; friendly when I have come in.  


Overall the food here was delicious, the service is good &amp; the place is clean.  I would definitely come here again if I was in the area."

In the grand scheme of things, it&#39;s a minor detail but sometimes it&#39;s those little things that you remember that may make tip the scale in your favor or drop it down.

The pizza itself was okay but it didn&#39;t completely wow me.   Maybe the peppers and extra cheese might&#39;ve made the difference.   Lou&#39;s has nothing to worry about just yet.    I may one day check out the ribs but I&#39;m not in any hurry to do so."

The online ordering system is one of the best I&#39;ve used.  Very intuitive and easy to work with.  Another plus is that you can request napkins, paper plates and forks/knives.  That&#39;s a nice touch.  

We had originally planned for delivery but opted instead to pick up the order.  Our driver said that he went to pick the order up and was called back into the restaurant three times for items they forgot to include.  Upon reaching the office and unbagging, we find we were short a lunch special, sauce for the boneless wings and bleu cheese for that same wings order.  We called and reordered the missing items which we received within 30 minutes along with a frozen small chocolate cake.

Overall the impressions of the food we ordered was marginal.  The mac &amp; cheese (small portion) was enough for two and was the highest rated item we ordered.  This was the only item that any of us would order again.  The grinders were fair but greasy/wet and drippy, the ribs tips ok, the monster pizza slice (when it finally arrived)  lives up to its name and was really big, but unfortunately the comments I heard were bland and &#39;like Little Ceasers&#39;.  We cannot give a good review of the boneless wings since they didn&#39;t come with their needed accompanying items.  The chicken fingers were dry and cold.    The lunch special prices were decent and included fries and a can of soda (coca-cola) which was awesome, but the fries weren&#39;t too warm when they arrived.  

Unfortunately, this is not a place that has earned our business or probably even another try based on this experience."

But their &#34;award winning&#34; ribs I ordered tonight were the absolute worst.  These were obviously not baked with sauce, nor baked for long.  The meat was tough and had plenty of half-cooked fat on them still.  The sauce was just slopped on, over both the ribs and the fries below, pretty much soaking the fries and ruining them.

Sorry. Don&#39;t order the ribs here.  Get the pizza ONLY.

Also, when I handed the delivery guy the tip (which I thought $5 was decent), he acted like I&#39;d given him a buck.  He gave me a look as in &#34;is that all?&#34;

I owed my buddy lunch, so I offered him a slice of pizza. I told him About Picasso&#39;s and how good it was, but that it was now Papa Rays. I hadn&#39;t stepped foot in Papa Rays since it became Papa Rays, but when I did, I was wowed. The decor is very nice, for being such a small place. You can now sit and eat there, unlike when it was Picasso&#39;s. When I had Picasso&#39;s, the slice was pretty big so I figured it was the same size. I asked the cashier, who was very friendly what the slices looked like, and pointed to a customer who just picked up his order and I thought had a full small pizza in a box. As he opened his pizza box, I saw a massive slice of pizza and literally blurted out &#34;holy sh*t that&#39;s big!&#34;. So that&#39;s what we ordered with fries for less than a buck more. The taste was fantastic. Sauce was tangy and cheese was chewy, how I like it. I had the slice with bacon and my buddy the pepperoni. They did not skimp at all. The dough was moist, soft and hot enough but not too hot. It was a great meal and they have all the add-ons such as pepper, Parmesan, spices and many, many bottles of hot sauce.

While the rib tips are ten dollars, they give you enough to make three normal portions so you really get a lot of juicy, tender, rib meat with very little gristle or fat.  They&#39;re BBQ sauce is delicious.

The Greek potatoes again as I&#39;ve said before are to die for.  You can always upgrade from fries to Greek potatoes at a very reasonable price.

I got three meals out of the rib tips and potatoes so the average cost per meal was less than $4.50.

Everything I had tasted fresh, seasoned just right and they gave big enough portions for several meals."

Parking is easy. The lot is split and there are basically two entrances/exits. When you walk inside, prepare to be overwhelmed. The choices are abundant!  We usually order some form of gyros, too many French fries, mozzarella sticks, some form of chicken (usually kabob), rice pudding and sometimes share a shake. It&#39;s just way too easy. Sure throw in an extra pita. Yeah, I&#39;ll take the onion rings too.

The business recently changed their name but food is still the same. Due to the crappy weather yesterday my boyfriend and I decided to order something close by. He told me he wanted a bacon burger and then changed his mind to wings. I was looking at the menu for a while. They have a lot!! Of options. Finally I called and places my order for barbecue rib tips and cheeseburger. I forgot my boyfriend changed his mind to wings! 

   They said it would be 15 minutes which was no problem. My boyfriend goes to pick up I stayed with my son so we would not have to take him out and he always checks nothing is missing anywhere we go. When he came home he told me he notices the cheeseburger and tells the gentlemen that he ordered wings not a burger. That gentleman was the manager! And he right away told his staff who confused a burger for wings. And apologized to my be and said he will get right on it but there will be a wait. My boyfriend told him it was fine n he will take the burger he was not upset. N the manager apologized again and gave him a free chocolate cake.
   
    In the end when my boyfriend told me I felt so bad because it was our mistake! We laughed but there was nothing we could do. We ate are food which was so good. He loved the burger! It was really big he couldn&#39;t finish it. I ate the cake. 
   
   We have always been and will remain loyal customers to this awesome fast food joint. And I apologize for my mistake but if it would have been theirs they handled it very very well!"

I figured if the food is good it will be worth it. 

I ordered two Greek gyros plates one with fries &amp; one with Greek potatoes. The entree includes a Greek salad which for me is great because I usually substitute the bread for salads. 

The menu description says &#34;extra gyros meat&#34; with onions, tomato &amp; cucumber sauce. Indeed there was a lot of meat given, a little dry but the flavor was there! I blame the delivery distance. ;) The potatoes &amp; fries were typical but not bad. The salad was delicious, all the Greek toppings included. 

I later reheated the rest of my gyros in a pan with olive oil, it re-hydrated the meat and tasted even better."

Yes, we can continue to seek &#39;great&#39; &amp; &#39;excellent&#39; gyros, but in my humble opinion, Brandys&#39; are perfect. Perhaps I&#39;m skewed. Perhaps the gyro-less desert in which I live met with this oasis of goodness is too much for me to handle, but I don&#39;t care.

We made the short-ish trek to Brandy&#39;s for seasoned, rotating meat, and found it next to an empty taekwondo building seemingly transplanted from Korea. Their location was nothing much (Brandy&#39;s--not the taekwondo place), but that adds to the charm of hot dog/gyro places (do we want good decor, or good food?). They were slow at the time we were there, so we effortlessly placed our orders, and patiently waited. No sooner did we get our fountain drink and ketchup cups secured, that our orders were ready to go. We dined in (hence the ketchup cups and not packets) and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.

After legitimately scarfing our meals, we sat back and cursed the decision to not wear stretchy pants that day, and sipped the last of the root beer.

Needless to say, this is the new go-to for gyros near us. I might select a closer location purely based on my convenience/laziness factors for the day, but hopefully I can always find time to make the trip to Brandy&#39;s when the gyro-hunger sets in."

Tip: ask for extra sauce. I like my gyro well done. Try it if you haven&#39;t already. 

Brandys is reasonably priced, they have 10,000 items in their menu, they deliver at reasonable time. Their fries-- meh, you can skip this. Their Mexican menu, mehhh you can skip this too. I&#39;m a Mexican food snob as well. If they use lettuce on the taco, SKIP IT!!! Well I guess only if you&#39;re into authentic Mexican food like me. The Oreo shake is really good!

I Ordered extra sauce which wasn&#39;t even needed. The chopped chicken salad was good but wasn&#39;t worth the $10.  Lettuce was a bit to fine (maybe bottom of batch) and had a ton of water at the bottom of the container. House dressing was bland the ranch was not as good as hidden valley from home.

First of all, I used to eat from the location in Des Plaines several years ago and never really was a big fan. This particular location was previously a Chiggys and I was never a fan of Chiggys even tho it is basically the same restaurant. It was dirty and the food was average. 

Brandy&#39;s in HP is one of my favorite grab a go or lunch spots in the area. I am over Omega and there really isn&#39;t anything else around the area like it. I want good Greek chicken and not fast food. They make a lot of their items in house. Their soup is ALWAYS homemade and the two times I have had it, it was excellent. My husband enjoys a good gyro and this is also his first choice for a local spot. 

They are a fast casual spot where you can sit and eat or take your deliciousness and dine at home. I&#39;m personally not one to sit in fast casual restaurants unless I&#39;m on the road. I hate paying $2+ for a soda (the prices of soft drinks in restaurants are just a pet peeve of mine) and they aren&#39;t typically the most comfortable places to relax and enjoy dinner. With that being said, Brandy&#39;s has a pretty nice dining room with a tv which keeps the hubby happy so that&#39;s a plus. Their tables are always clean and the owners/management obviously take pride in their establishment. 

I recommend giving them a shot for a quick meal when you are looking for something casual AND homemade!"

There used to be one near me in Lombard, I&#39;ve spotted one around around the North side on Harlem (possibly Harwood Heights or Norridge) and am sure I&#39;ve seen a few others over the years. This particular Brandy&#39;s location was not too long ago home to a place called &#34;Chiggy&#39;s Gyro&#34;. While I was in the general area one afternoon I decided to stop by Brandy&#39;s and give the hot dog a try.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that some remodeling was done. Everything on the inside looked new and clean, this isn&#39;t a bad thing but it came off as a bit sterile. I&#39;d say the place was a little over-decorated for a fast food greasy spoon style eatery reminding me a bit more of a pancake house. I placed my order for a hot dog and fries and took a seat. Within a few minutes my food was ready and it was time to dig in.

The hot dog I received came on a regular non-poppy seed bun. The bun was not steamed and was a little on the dry side. The sausage used was skinless and seemed to have been heated up well enough. There were two tomato slices, light onion applied, a good amount of relish and very little mustard on this hot dog. The pickle spear on this hot dog was both thick making it the dominant flavor when you bite into the dog, and too short so that you can&#39;t get pickle in every bite if you wanted to. My overall thoughts on this dog are that it&#39;s pretty bad. It&#39;s a situation where there&#39;s not one particularly glaring flaw that ruins the hot dog but almost everything about it is done poorly to create one single hot dog encapsulating disappointment and mediocrity. The bun was dry, the condiment application was poor, and the pickle was too thick.

I also got some fries with my hot dog. These were average fries that were slightly thinner than most steak fries, but had the same general taste. They weren&#39;t too salty or too greasy. These were perfectly competent fries but not enough to salvage the meal. 

 Immediately after leaving here I set off to nearby original Nana&#39;s and got a much better hot dog, with regret for having ever stepped foot in Brandy&#39;s. Perhaps some of the other food at Brandy&#39;s is better than the hot dog and in all fairness I&#39;ve had much worse hot dogs and much worse fries. I am not going to recommend Brandy&#39;s and have no plans to return again. Two stars for Brandy&#39;s and a suggestion to keep driving if you&#39;re in the mood for a hot dog."

With a name saying Home Of The Gyros I figured they were worth a chance, and boy am I glad we did. This being our first time ordering from them, we ordered two gyros and two sub sandwiches along with a couple fountain drinks to be delivered. These sandwiches were AMAZING!!!! The gyros is freshly sliced from a rotisserie and is the best, most tender gyros I&#39;ve ever had, period. The pita bread is perfectly prepared, not hard but nicely done and soft. The tzatziki Sauce (cucumber sauce to the novice) is also perfect. It&#39;s not runny, not overly loaded with cucumbers and is very thick to compliment the gyros as a topping. Overall, one of the best if not the best gyros I&#39;ve ever had, and it was delivered to my door, how can you ever beat that! We also ordered ham and turkey subs. Having never ordered we didn&#39;t know if they would load it up with lettuce and skimp on the meat and cheese but not the case here. These are some very meaty subs. A layer of meat, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and then another layer of meat. Screw Subway, these are way better than any sub sandwich around.

For the meal alone I would have given them a perfect 5 stars and they would deserve it. To be honest though on the total experience, I had to ding them one star and I&#39;ll explain. For one I opted to order through their website instead of phoning in my order. Mind you I could have called, which I actually did to check if they delivered to me and the staff were extremely friendly, but me being a geek wanted to try out ordering through their website. Major bummer on ordering online. I managed to get the order in, but it&#39;s not very easy to navigate or to get to your shopping cart once you add items. They really need a better shopping cart on their website to do true justice to this fantastic restaurant. Food great, online ordering not so much. Recommend ordering by phone for now. The 2nd issue was that one person who had one of the subs wanted it with no dressing. The options to select what you want on your sandwich, again the site is not so user friendly on this, shows various dressing options but no option to choose NO DRESSING. There was a field to add notes on special requests so I did note there that we wanted No Dressing on that particular sandwich. It looks like the online order comes to them the an actual person may be keying in the order to their order system, and this person may have overlooked that special request so the sandwich came with mayo. The person eating it survived, loved the sandwich with a little hatred towards the mayo, but still was a great sandwich. While these two things may seam minor, I felt they affected our first experience with them, and our ability to order, so I had to take away 1 star. Next time we&#39;ll order via phone and I&#39;m sure they will earn a full 5 in that manner. I can appreciate though that they are trying to accommodate all of their customers in offering online ordering but someone sold them a bad website and shopping cart. I&#39;m sure they will probably be or may already be, working on resolving those matters. Besides, if you can phone the order in, who really needs to order online anyway...just us dumb geeks ;).

If you want a great meal, at least as far as gyros and sub sandwiches go (for now that&#39;s all we have tried) get your butt to Brandy&#39;s or call them up for delivery if your in their delivery area.

I&#39;m a Greek household, and perhaps I have higher expectations for a gyro.  We ordered a plain gyro, a hot feta gyro, and a chicken gyro.  

The gyros cuts are too fat, then grilled, or possibly fried with the vast amount of grease that was in both of the regular gyros.  

The hot feta one at most had a teaspoon of hot feta in the sandwich.  Shame on you.  

The chicken gryo was grilled for so long that it was crunchy!!!

For the gyros only. And ask for no salt on the fries."

If you like Greek salad this is the place. They also have great deep fried jumbo shrimp. I love the soup and fresh bread here too. I won&#39;t eat a gyro anywhere else. I recommend getting an extra pita because the gyro is that big.

Let me tell you, those potatoes are EVERYTHING. You get two potato wedges that are perculated with delicious lemon juice and what I believe is rosemary...oh my goodness, so good.

The gyro I had was good as well. My meal contained tons of meat and a reasonable amount of cucumber sauce, but only one slice of pita. Next time I&#39;ll have to remember to ask for an additional bread slab to transport the rest of the lamb in...one was simply not enough. Dinner also came with a small side salad.

Delivery came in under 30 minutes and I think I&#39;ll be trying them again to see what other good stuff they have."

Its practically the same menu and even the cups it says Brandys/Chiggys.. so I don&#39;t know if they just want people to realize its the same owners or whatever..

Prices are more expensive this time around, but that&#39;s OK, the restaurant definitely got a face lift after the fire and the portions are still enormous, I mean a normal sized Gyro really should be split between two people, but who wants to do that? ;)

The cashier that took our food order had the personality of a wet mop, but I didn&#39;t let it bother me since I was just dying for Gyros and sauce.

I got their soup and it was cream of rice which really hit the spot.  I then had a burger plain and it was how a grilled burger should be, perfectly cooked meat and fresh sift bread.

The gyros tastes the same but looks nicer new trays and plates.  Portions are just as generous as before.

Service did seem nicer though. I didn&#39;t see the same pushy lady from before and didn&#39;t feel rushed to order from their huge menu.

Brandy&#39;s is my second stop, Pita BBQ being my first (see me review).  I say it many times, given the same ingredients, you cannot screw up a Chicago style hot dog.  I feel the same about a gyro.
The sorry excuse of a gyro I got was was so greasy, it made you want to gag.  I patted down the gyros with napkins and continued the suffering.  The cucumber sauce was runny and could not bear to ingest the greasy sponge known as the pita bread.  Insult to injury, the fries lacked flavor and were under cooked.
On top of all that, the person manning the POS did not seem to care.  The dining and soda areas &#34;looked&#34; clean but had that sticky dingy feel to it.

Whatever it is , it&#39;s not pastrami.  Too lean and not enough spicing for true pastrami such as found at Katz&#39;s in NYC and many other Jewish delis on the East Coast and in Florida.  My wife had the pulled pork and thought it was good.  The sandwiches are large and the fries were pretty good.  I do have a few comments about the restaurant.  First, the sporks are useless.  You can&#39;t eat a sandwich that is falling apart with a puny spork.  The buns are really soft and don&#39;t work at all for the &#34;pastrami&#34;.  They need a firmer roll like a Kaiser or onion roll but there is no choice.  And there should be decent sized cups for the canned pop and water, not dixie cups!  
Lastly, when is the last time you were in a BBQ that did not have sauces on the tables?  We&#39;re talking about sauces here, not splits of Dom Perignon.  They hand out the sauce like it is a pricy commodity.
Seatin is limited with plenty of room for more seats if they wished but perhaps they are small enough so they prefer carryouts.
I&#39;ll be back to try the brisket and pork but I&#39;ll travel to Skokie for real pastrami.
P.S.  Real pastrami doesn&#39;t need a BBQ sauce...just a touch of mustard or horseradish."

They said they trim their meat so it&#39;s not fatty and the pulled pork sandwich was lean like I prefer.  We also got a half-slab of ribs. They were also lean and had a lot of meat on them.  For a side I got mac &amp; cheese bites which were breaded and shaped in little triangles.  In general the food was edible, but I&#39;ve had much tastier and impressive barbecue.  

If you&#39;re looking for a local barbecue place, give this a try.  It&#39;s convenient, and they are very nice people.  But if you&#39;re craving barbecue that&#39;s going to make you close your eyes and savor every incredible mouthful... unfortunately this just isn&#39;t that place."

The pulled Pork is pretty nasty and gummy tasting - threw it out
Corn bread was beautiful looking and other than that dry as can be 

The good-
Brisket is good
Sauce is decent
Coleslaw is very wet but unexpectedly great
Beans needed a direction - they were good but basic ... A sweet, tangy or smokey add would perfect these

No billowing smoke wafting the through the air. No pig blood flowing in the streets. If we didn&#39;t have an address, we would not have found it. I passed up an empty parking spot right in front of the place because I was looking for the smoke and grease.

Now, as soon as I opened the door, the seared-meat-dripping-woody-goody incense filled my olfactory organs with such sweet, tangy, heaven-sent scents, I nearly lost my mind. (I literally still cannot find it. If you see it it answers to &#34;pizza&#34;)

A long wooden pew sits adjacent to the counter for you to pray that they aren&#39;t out of pastrami before you get your order in to the hostess. Then you can wait in a stupor, killing the minutes until the man behind the curtain appears with your order.

And know that Siri cannot, for the fracking love of GOD, find it because the damn thing searches for PORKIES when I use voice-search... anyway.

Ribs: Excellent. Smoky. Juicy, Seared, Tender. Bone-sucking-goodness.

Pulled Pork: Pulled. Porky. Perfection.

Pastrami: Pounds or probably just plenty of pure heaven. The bun is a little weak but holds up if you hurry.

Pig-sty fries: No other fries would suffice. Any meat. Beans. Fries. F*&amp;$ING SIMPLY BRILLIANT AND DELICIOUS.

Cole Slaw: Cole slaw-y. Plain. Simple. Sweet. Creamy. Crunchy. MMMM.

MacNCheese bites have bitten my heart.

Sweet sauce or Sweet Spicy sauce. Both are very decent. Not too sweet but nice flavor  to compliment (instead of overpower) the outstanding smoke flavors and aromas on the perfectly prepared meats.

They don&#39;t have anything to drink except pop (can) and water (tap or bottle) so BYOB (bring your own bike- and take it togo... hint hint)

Get in here!! But don&#39;t stay. There&#39;s just not enough room for everyone. Take it home and then there&#39;s less public shame for scarfing down two sandwiches and a pig-sty fries. Am I right?

If you&#39;re proud of your gluttony, park benches line the sidewalks so you can show-off your freak-show. Use a wet-nap or six and don&#39;t feed the dog&#39;s walking by. It&#39;s bad for them. Jerk.

Oh, and don&#39;t order the pastrami Sandwich. It sucks. Eat ribs or something else. Just leave the pastrami alone."

As a certified BBQ judge, I believe there should be a certain standard met if a place is going to put themselves out there as a BBQ place. Porky&#39;s has nailed it.

I think they could charge just for the smell.  That&#39;s a giveaway that they have a couple of smokers in the back and they smoke their brisket for 14 hours.  I had the brisket and my wife had the pork.

Both were cooked to perfection with a bit of sauce (not overpowering) with additional sauce on the side.  The brisket was pulled and I wish I could get some slices with the bark.  We order fries and they were not greasy, perfectly done and crispy, not soggy.

My wife ordered beans and cole slaw and said she would go there just for the sides.  The cole slow wasn&#39;t drenched, but was fresh and crisp with a great taste.

I would recommend trying Porky&#39;s for good BBQ done right."

On a 40° day with sleet and snow flurries, Porky&#39;s BBQ finally opened. As I consider myself a bit of a BBQ aficionado, I&#39;ve been very anxious for this place to open. Even though I already had lunch, a coworker said they were open and I rushed right over to try a little barbecue. I&#39;ll be the first to say that they did not disappoint.

Porky&#39;s is a small storefront located right near the downtown AH district. Their menu is currently limited to smoked/BBQ sandwiches, ribs, salads, sides and a kids menu. As I mentioned that I already had lunch, I opted for half slab of ribs, barbecue beans, and their coleslaw.

Even with opening day and a handful of customers, they were quick with my order. 

The Cole slaw was creamy and very good. The beans had a nice bite, I assume their BBQ sauce is part of the base, and had nice chunks of pork added. The two together were a winner!

Now, I have to explain. I am a KCBS certified judge, and a novice competitor. Ribs that fall off the bone are over cooked and usually over sauced. You want that, go to Chili&#39;s. Not saying that&#39;s bad, but it&#39;s not true BBQ, and won&#39;t be found at a competition. 

That being said, Porky&#39;s ribs for opening day were not bad, in fact pretty tasty. I got a half slab. The ribs were not over sauced (I usually order ribs dry with sauce on the side, but wanted to try them first their way). The meat had a nice chew, were not overly smoked, but had a nice pink ring. The owners said they smoke onsite, and I expect they will get better over time. 

For a small takeout BBQ joint, I can definitely recommend!!

Welcome to the neighborhood Porky&#39;s!!

*Update* My boss and I stopped back in for lunch. He had the combo and I had the the brisket sandwich. Outstanding! Very juicy and lots of meat. Not overly sauced or overly smoked. He got the fresh cut fries which were good and I got the Mac and cheese bites. Delicious!

The owner Frank gave us a sample of his pastrami. Holy cow! Had to be the best pastrami I ever had.  Perfect tenderness and smoke!!!"

I started off with my favorite ; brisquet. The lady who took my to go order asked if I wanted sweet or hot. It threw me off so I asked what she recommend and she said sweet. It was a very very good sandwich. Just enough sauce that was perfect amount of sauce and meat in every bite.

The slaw was good and I&#39;m still trying to put my finger on the best way to describe it. It was good. Different good. 

The fries were the only thing that were eh. They were homemade which is always good but the size of steak fries. Tasted more like potatoes than french fries. I&#39;ll try them again. Fries kept the review a 4/5 instead of 5/5."

BUT, the meats don&#39;t have that rich pit smoke flavor you find down south and this is the only BBQ place I&#39;ve ever seen that ONLY serves sandwiches. Why can&#39;t I just get a plate of brisket, or a combo plate? You would probably pull in a bigger dinner crowd and sell more sides. Sandwiches are a lunch thing, imo. Why do you expect someone to order cornbread or Mac with a sandwich? That&#39;s too much starch for a balanced plate. Also, you alienate people who avoid carbs or gluten.

The brisket was good. It didn&#39;t tastes super smoked and was pulled instead of sliced, which was the weirdest thing. I didn&#39;t see any smoke ring and got no bark and I wish it had slices of brisket. So, I won&#39;t be ordering that again.

The pulled pork was good. Again, barely smoked. It was on par with any basic pulled pork sandwich. But I&#39;d order again.

The turkey sandwich was good, but it was machine-sliced, which made it feel like deli meat. I was expecting hand-carved turkey. Also, consider offering a homemade cranberry chutney on this.

Like I said, I&#39;m happy to see this place open and want them to succeed. As a brand-new place, they need some time to hit their stride. I&#39;d love to see them make some adjustments, like sliced brisket, carved turkey, plates in addition to sandwiches, and not charging extra for extra sauce. If people want more sauce, it just means you didn&#39;t put enough on for their liking. Give them whatever it takes for them to enjoy your food the way they like it! Don&#39;t be penny-rich and dollar-foolish."

Pulled pork was ok but not very juicy and had very little smoke. I want to like Porkys because it&#39;s close but i was really underwhelmed and probably won&#39;t be back.

This BBQ place is a keeper and switches up the downtown Arlington Bites routine. The cost is reasonable. I paid $12 for a half slab of ribs (only available Fri sat and sun) and beans. The beans were phenomenal and the ribs superb. I had the hot sauce and it was just great. Ann was at the front. A lovely girl who is the sister of the owner and is as pretty as she is supportive of the family business. I got to meet the owner who was super nice and the experience was great! My only thought was I wished they used a plate and had sturdier plastic knives. I ended up cutting the paper the ribs were on and it got a bit messy. But is silverware is my biggest concern you know it is a good place. I will be back and highly recommend Porkys :).

I know its not easy to produce excellent bbq in volumes time and time again so I will presume that it could have been an off night for Porky&#39;s. 
My pick was a half rack with a side of fried mac n cheese and coleslaw to go so I will give a little leeway being the food wasn&#39;t piping hot when I ate it. So my food experience was the ribs were very light on smoke with no evidence of a smoke ring, they were not reheated properly, over cooked and a bit dry. To top it off I much prefer dry rub over sauce. He slaw and mac n cheese were good but disappointed there were no fried pickles on the menu. 
Obviously folks like the place, it just didn&#39;t offer up enough for me."

We had pulled pork and brisket, the pulled pork was my favorite.  They have two sauces - try them both.  But you may want to ask for it with no sauce and then just add it like you want it.  My sandwich was dripping with sauce, but my wife&#39;s had just a little sauce.  Better to do it yourself so you get it how you like.

The place is very small, just three tables inside and one outside.  I really hope they put more tables outside like the other restaurants just a few blocks away.  Also, they really need a sign - you wouldn&#39;t know it&#39;s a BBQ joint if you were driving by.  You have to know it&#39;s there to see it!  It just looks like it&#39;s part of the business next to it.  At least put a chalkboard out front...something!

Back to the food.  It was served hot and pretty quickly - two good things.  Portions were good for a $6-7 dollar sandwich.  We ordered fries and beans for the sides.  Lots of fries - good job.  The beans were maybe my favorite thing - outstanding!  But...you only get a small cup of beans.  I&#39;m talking a really small cup -- the kind of thing in which you&#39;d get a side of salad dressing.

We will definitely go back.  When you have a craving for good, quick, inexpensive BBQ give it a try!"

Having lived in the southern states for a while and have taken several trips to Texas, I can say that this BBQ is pretty darn good. 

Now the reason I gave this 4 stars is pretty similar to everyone else in one aspect, the brisket is not sliced but pulled which is a sad thing but ok. The other reason is that their sauce choices are limited and the hot sauce is very thin and not very flavorful. The sweet, which is always my favorite anyway, is spot on though. 

I wish they would offer fries but the mac&#39;n cheese bites make up for it - though they are a little salty. 

The cornbread muffin feels/tastes almost like a Jiffy mix but I am ok with that. It isn&#39;t a large kitchen and they need to conserve time and money in how they operate. Besides it isn&#39;t what I go there for.

So all in all, If you get the pulled pork with sweet and mac&#39;n cheese bites then you are golden. I hope to stop by one weekend though and make sure I try the ribs."

Ribs are good but only available on weekends.  We live just down the street and the smell of BBQ wafting from the smoker is awesome!  The regular sauce is a little too sweet for me but their spicier sauce is perfect.  Overall a great addition to Arlington Heights.  I wish they had a license for alcohol but a store called Vintages with a small but nice beer selection is around the corner.  It&#39;s really a takeout place anyways with very limited seating.

(But regardless of bias, the pizza is some of the best in the surrounding areas!). I&#39;ve been coming here since I was a kid (though it&#39;s been renovated so much since then). Came here every holiday I was home from college too. There is something to be said about having a local bar where all the people from the surrounding suburbs of Roselle, Itasca, Bloomingdale, Wood Dale, and Medinah go. Not many places like Tree Guys, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. 
It&#39;s a bar and a restaurant. You can go through the back entrance to either the bar (on the left) or the restaurant (on the right). The restaurant has a nice patio in the summer time. Service is always good and the same servers are there which I like. If something is wrong, tell a server and they will take care of it (and we even got free drinks tokens once, which I appreciate). 
The food is my fav, especially the pizza, which has pretty thin crust. The deep dish is really good too, so if Lou Malnati&#39;s has too long of a wait, we&#39;ll just go to Tree Guys instead. My other favs are the fries, spinach dip, and of course the buffalo chicken wrap. I&#39;ve had other stuff too and all has been solid. Prices are extremely reasonable, so no complaints there. 
Super fun place to go to watch a Hawks game or any sporting game really. Lots of TVs (but it&#39;s not an obnoxious amount of TVs). Ambience is cool, and drink specials are great. Good beer selection too. Can&#39;t go wrong with Tree Guys. A local favorite!"

The kitchen has some serious issues.  Of the last 10 times I&#39;ve dined here, 50-70% of the orders were returned.  My latest issue was tonight, I ordered a pizza, grilled italian sausage, and a side of vodka sauce. (order #118) What I got was a pizza, and a grilled sausage smothered with vodka sauce.  When I received my order with the sauce on the side, they replaced my grilled sausage with a deep fried sausage that tasted like a burnt corn dog.  Who fries italian sausage????  Disgusting.  Other issues I&#39;ve had in the past is under-cooked food, wrong food delivered than what ordered, and when ordering gluen-free anything, be weary - I had 2 days of a sick friend because of a mix-up in the kitchen.  

I still really like this restaurant, I just wish they&#39;d fire the hacks that work in the kitchen and hire someone that knows something.  The quality is sinking fast, to the point where it feels like a gyro joint.

Looks like your typical sports bar. Not so much Italinan as others mentioned. We sat in the bar area at a high top. Fairly decent and clean looking. Our service was very good and the prices are more than fair here. 

They have daily food specials for which Sunday&#39;s was an all you can eat chicken dinner for 11 bucks. Can&#39;t beat that deal. It came with a choice of salad or soup, mashed potatoes and slaw. I tried the pasta figole soup which was decent. The salads looked ok. A decent portion of your typical dinner salad, nothing fancy. The chicken was pretty good. It had a nice crunch and taste. The pieces were smaller so my guess is that these are not the steroid grown version, which is great by me! The chicken was good enough to get a second helping after the first 4 pieces. The potatoes were home made but a bit bland and still ok. The slaw was decent. They did have a Bloody Mary special for 3 bucks. Basic version with bar vodka and some spicy to it. I opted to pay an upcharge for a better vodka. 

As for the pizza the others had it was pretty good. I tried a piece of the sausage and was pleased with the good amount of toppings and a very good sauce as well as a nice crisp thin crust. Also it was not at all greasy. That tells me they were using some quality ingredients. 

So all in all not a bad place to come for decent food at the right price. I would come back if in the area."

This is a great little place in the city by Taska. They have a restaurant and a bar that are separated by a wall you need to go outside to go between the restaurant and the bar. What is nice is the bar serves bar food.  Tonight was $5.25 hamburgers and they had $4 dollar margaritas. They have many TVs in the place to watch whatever game is on.

She insists that these are the best wings in the area...Which i cant really agrue, the best wings ive ever had are in Naperville at Crosstown.  

The wings here are larger compared to their competitors in the area (i.e. wing stop, and bww), and their buffalo sauce is really good. I give thier bbq wings a shot and that was a little disappointing. The sauce lacked flavor and tasted really cheap. The burgers here are good too, and the fries here are awesome, they taste extremely fresh and have the skin on. 

The pizza is good aswell, but i wouldn&#39;t say its a favorite.  Ive ordered appetizers before, but im not too crazy about them. 

Ive made my way over to the bar part of the restaurant and its ok.....one time i went during the day and it was pretty chill with tvs on and a few people there. The other time i went it was jam packed and felt like a high school reunion,  i totally hated that and will never return on a weekend night."

Ingredients are high quality, and it&#39;s delish hot, reheated or cold for pizza breakfast the next day. Thin crust and deep dish are equally good, but I prefer the thin crust since they cut into the little squares. Price is reasonable for the amount of pizza you get, and they have coupons every once in a while too. 

I can&#39;t comment on any of their other food, but pizza is worth a try if you are in the area."

I had the eggplant parmesan sandwich and my wife and cousin had meatball subs. The meatball was fairly moist. The eggplant was very thin and not noticeable under all the bread. There was hardly any spice in the sauce (they used the same for each). Worst of it all...the sauce and meatballs are lukewarm. They must have been sitting around for a bit pre-made. The cheese on top was melted, but not hot at all. I was expecting something right out of the oven or broiler. Not here. I also cut off half of my sandwiches&#39; bread. It&#39;s not anything special. Go to your local supermarket and buy a plain loaf of French bread-that&#39;s what you&#39;ll get here. It was too dry and no chewy Gonnella-like texture.

I could have dealt with the bread, the lack of flavor in the sauce, but for heaven&#39;s sake heat it up at least so I know you are at least trying.

Won&#39;t be back."

We arrived just after two. We entered from the back which could have been the front. It was a little confusing. We saw the huge lunch buffet that everyone talks about. Two ladies behind the buffet called to us and said we could sit anywhere. I would say service is &#34;cold&#34; and not welcoming. They were serving indoors and in the patio. Maybe short staffed. But it didn&#39;t stop a &#34;sit down&#34; with someone I assumed as the owner and a family member regarding legal problems. My review is based on the food. If service had been welcoming, this experience would have been a four. We could not try the buffet for $7.95 because it ended at 2pm. Hubs ordered a burger and I ordered linguine w white clam sauce. Dinner salad to start. Hubs wanted an Arnold Palmer but they couldn&#39;t do it at the time bc they had no unsweetened ice tea. He had water. They have Pepsi products. I ordered diet Pepsi. When we ordered food, our server asked &#34;fries or chips&#34;. My hubs asked what do u suggest which was met w awkward silence and kind of an eye roll. WTH?!  So. I don&#39;t think we will dine in anymore. I may order pizza for pick up to eat at our favorite brewery nearby."

Plus, they have Craft Street brews and I give them major props for supporting the most local brewery them all in Chicagoland.

The bathrooms here are disgusto. Even more gross is I usually end up using the guys&#39; bathroom because the ladies&#39; one has long lines...and the boys&#39; bathroom is just---ugh. yuck. 

Service is always meh here.

I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go to Tree Guys however once you&#39;re in here, it&#39;s always a great time.

I have never been disappointed with their food, atmosphere or service.  I have dined in the bar area, restaurant and patio and have always enjoyed myself.  My top favorite menu items are the bacon pizza, extra crispy, which is on special on Tuesday nights and for dessert the fried dough with dipping sauce.  Also, the prices are always reasonable, you can spend a night drinking and eating with friends/family and never worry that your bill be unreasonable by any means.  If you&#39;re ever in the area, Tree Guys is a definite!  Enjoy!"

I however wanted a real pizza place. I didn&#39;t want delivery, $5 pizza, Italian restaurant that makes pizza too or a fast food place that makes pizza. I wanted the kind you walk into where the table already has the pizza holders, red pepper and parm cheese already set up. They didn&#39;t disappoint. We ordered 2 individual size pizzas, combo basket and the kids mac and cheese. We had an all sausage half mushroom, green pepper, &amp; onion pizza. Hubby had sasage, pepperoni &amp; green olives (gross to me but he enjoyed it). They had just the right amount of toppings for me. The combo basket had enough to share between the 3 of us. Although I would of liked a couple more cheese sticks. It comes with 2 and their the only thing our daughter liked. Our waitress was a doll to our little one who always wants to talk. We&#39;ll be back again. Everything was tasty and we had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day."

The Tree Guys favorite pizza, which contained spinach, garlic, and Romano cheese, tasted quite good and the ingredients tasted very fresh. The individual size was easily large enough to share-i took more than half of it home. My children got pasta, and both dishes were fresh and flavorful, especially for pasta dishes. 

Service was about 10 minutes too slow. The restaurant was half full so I&#39;m not sure why. That is the only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review. We will go back again and if service improves, I will update this review."

It was a beautiful day in downtown Itasca today. The sun was shining, a clean breeze was blowing, and the 3 fore mentioned modes of transportation were audibly and visually on top of you while eating lunch on the deck at Tree Guys.   At one point the train was blowing, an airplane was approaching, cars were streaming by, and a truck was backing up somewhere. Most people would find it annoying, but I think it creates some much needed pauses in lunch time conversations where you CAN ACTUALLY EAT...remember, that&#39;s what we came to do when we arrived...EAT!

Been here several times, and today&#39;s visit was typical. This is a bar. They serve bar food. Burgers, pizza, fried food, and then some salads. It&#39;s all decent bar food, but I wouldn&#39;t go any further than that. 

Not the best, or the worst.  So a solid stuck in the middle 3."

The owner of this place doesn&#39;t seem to care. Not once in the many years we ate there did the owner ever come over to our table, ask how everything was, or even say hello. I went to pick up a pizza for takeout and there was no one in the place. The owner and a server were the only people there. When I asked for the pizza the owner looked at me and walked away saying noting, I paid for the pizza and left, never to return. Too bad, it was once worth going to."

The service was just OK.  Our waitress was there...that&#39;s about it.  Not friendly, not putting forth any more than she had to, just...present.  Eh, I&#39;ve had better in the service department.  However, the food was also just &#34;ok&#34; as well.  The patio was really nice to sit on on a nice summer evening in June.  It was large and spacious and very popular with the locals!

I got the pasta with vodka sauce, my daughter got the kid&#39;s mac n cheese, and everyone else got pizza.  The pizza was ok.  That&#39;s about the only good thing about the meal.  

The kid&#39;s mac n cheese was Kraft.  Good, but not worth the price considering it&#39;s $1 for a box.  If you&#39;re paying that much for mac n cheese at a supposed Italian restaurant, I don&#39;t expect it to be out of a box...

My pasta came with soup--I tried the pasta e fagioli soup, and it was NOT good.  It tasted like bean soup.  WAY too heave on the beans, and the broth wasn&#39;t that good, either.  So the base is bad, the ingredients are bad.  I only took about three bites.  Luckily, it was free, otherwise I would have been very disappointed!

The actual pasta was just ok, too.  The vodka sauce wasn&#39;t the best, but it was definitely edible.  I have my favorite vodka sauce, and this place didn&#39;t come close, unfortunately.


The pizza was good, though.  And I didn&#39;t pay, otherwise my review might have been lower!  I would come back to try some different things, but not on my own dime ;)"

Sadly, it was a disappointment.  I checked out the on line menu, so I had a pretty good idea of what I was going to order. When I got there (I was ordering take out),  I asked for a recommendation between the breaded mushrooms and breaded zucchini.   I was told, the mushrooms, since they don&#39;t have zucchini any more.  I said, okay, then mushrooms it is.  I was then told that they have a new menu, but hadn&#39;t changed the on line menu yet,  which was apparent, since the prices were higher and the zucchini was missing.  At any rate, I paid for my order and left and came back a bit later to pick up my order, as I was pressed for time, and when I returned I was handed a pizza box.  I then asked for my mushrooms, which by now, I was really looking forward to.  The person who took my order then told me that I ordered the mushrooms ON the pizza.  I said, no I didn&#39;t, and reminded her of the big discussion about the breaded mushrooms vs breaded zucchini, which was no longer available.  She then said, yes, and then you ordered mushrooms ON your pizza.  Let me tell you.  I have never in my life ordered mushrooms ON my pizza.  I don&#39;t like mushrooms ON my pizza.  Still, the person who took my order kept insisting the mistake was mine.  Yeah, no it really wasn&#39;t.  Then, she finally offered to put in an order for the mushrooms.  I was a bit pressed for time, and really couldn&#39;t wait any longer, so I just took my mushroom covered pizza and left.  She NEVER said she was sorry for HER mistake - she never admitted it was HER mistake.  I had never had their pizza before, and I will say, I found it to be okay.  Not great.  A good crust is key to a great pizza and I found it to be dry and lacking flavor.  So,  with all of the pizza joints in the area, will I return? Not with that attitude, I won&#39;t.  I don&#39;t mind people making mistakes.  I do mind them not taking responsibility for them.  The other food might be good, but I fear I will never know.  Such a shame. First impressions are lasting ones, Tree Guys and this was a fail for you."

A bunch of insurance professionals after an evening meeting looking for a tasty dinner. And that&#39;s exactly what we found. 

We wanted to sit in the dining room, but they were packed and there was nowhere for six of us to sit together. It was a Tuesday evening, so there was plenty of room in the bar. We sat in there. 

We ordered two large pizzas. Buy one, get one free (up to $12 off) on Tuesdays. This works. Unfortunately, the margarita pizza was over $25. I thought it was a mistake on the bill, but apparently it was right. 

The pizzas were good. The service was not. At all. Sitting in the bar seemed to mean that since we weren&#39;t chugging beers at the actual bar that we didn&#39;t deserve attention. Our quick dinner took way too long. From having to ask twice for menus to having to hunt down the waitress for the bill. Then there was some confusion about the drink special. One of the other gals asked about the special. It was a draft beer for $1.50 or something like that. She said that sounded good and ordered one. Her beer came in a bottle. The check came and the beer was $3.25. Obviously we should have said something when the drink special arrived in a bottle rather than a glass. But the waitress obviously misunderstood the original request. Annoying. 

Overall, I prefer Tree Guys for carryout pizzas. The crust is great, the sauce is nice and there are plenty of toppings in every bite."

I ordered the Tree Guys Favorite, 10 inch. In Chicago I noticed that I don&#39;t feel like a fat hog when leaving the pizza places where I ate. I appreciate that.

The crust is thin, but not crackery, like a certain chain restaurant. The sauce isn&#39;t too sweet, or too spicy. The sauce is really good. The cheese, there was plenty, and it had good flavor. The spinach was carefully placed, and wasn&#39;t droopy. 

The service was AOK. I ordered iced tea, and it remained full. I thought the prices were reasonable, and I was pleased. What I really wanted was a rhinestone Tree Guy&#39;s Pizza shirt like the girls were wearing. Not available. 

I gave this place 5 stars cause it&#39;s certainly a huge step up from the resort hotel I was staying at. I didn&#39;t order bread sticks, or anything other than pizza. I didn&#39;t have much time, and I was very pleased they got the pizza out to me in time to eat it and enjoy it.

I went on a Wednesday for the first time, to try the buffet. The buffet was REALLY small, a couple pizzas -- fish, a few salads. Wasn&#39;t impressed by it as compared to say, Aurelio&#39;s buffet. Out of the pizzas on the buffet, my favorite was the deep dish.

Went back another time and just got the pizza and was really impressed. The sausage has a great flavor and the crust was nice and crispy. The sauce didn&#39;t give me heartburn which is always a bonus. :) The price was lower than what I&#39;m used to so no complaints there! My only issue is that for lunch, the pizzas take forever to get out there so I feel kind of rushed eating. 

All that said, looking forward to when it&#39;s warm out so I can eat outside on their deck.

Located in beautiful downtown Itasca, IL, Tree Guys is located in an old building retrofitted as a restaurant.

I would classify them as Italian - they are known for pizza and pasta, but have more traditional Chicago fare, salads, hot wings, etc.  So, the selection is large.

I&#39;ve been there a few times and have tried their burgers, chicken sandwich and wings.  During my visit last week I tried their burger for the first time.  It is served on a regular hamburger bun, with lettuce, tomato and onion.  You have a choice of side and I chose their home made potato chips.

The burger was very good.  Made perfectly medium, it was grilled and very juicy.  The chips were also very good - they were not greasy and were not overly salty like so many chips are.  

The place is kind of a dump though.  My impression is that it is clean, but it looks like it has not been redecorated since the 1950s.  Perhaps that&#39;s how they keep their prices in line.  

But, discounting the appearance, the food is good and the prices fair.  The service is also very good and this helps make the experience a good one."

First, I&#39;ll review the restaurant. When you walk in the door, don&#39;t stand there like an idiot waiting for someone to seat you (that&#39;s what I did my first time and everyone was staring at me). You have to go up to the counter and someone will seat you from there. The food is really good. The cheeseburger sliders are awesome. They kind of taste like butterburgers but they are really delicious. I have yet to try their pasta or pizza, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s good. They really know how to cook their food well. Their chicken parmasan is great. They know how to bread it well so that you&#39;re not eating all bread and no chicken. I would also recommend getting the sandwich version of this. You will not regret it. My dad didn&#39;t like their ribs, but c&#39;mon, who orders ribs at an Italian restaurant?  

Now the bar. I go here for Thursday night football since the bar has NFL network (score!). You can eat dinner at the bar instead of the restaurant. They have about 10 beers on tap and a full bar. As far as the environment? If you didn&#39;t know that it was part of Tree Guys, you would think this is a regular dive bar, and I guess it is. A lot of locals come here. There are also the usual drinking-since-10am guys who like to argue with fans of opposing teams, just for the hell of it. Who argues a Jets/Broncos game? Townies. It&#39;s funny to hear. If you want to sit, it may be difficult to find seats, but they&#39;ll free up eventually. I&#39;ve seen kids here too. I don&#39;t really think you should bring kids to a bar, especially for their birthday, but hey, do what you gotta do. Overall, this place is good. Just don&#39;t go to the bar for a nice cocktail. For that, go sit in the restaurant."

I specifically asked if we could have one of the open tables and was told I could not. I asked if they were reserved and was told they do not take reservations. I started raising he!! and then they seated my family.

On another trip the coaches (I was a coach also) called a few days ahead to let them know we had a team coming in and we pre-ordered our pizzas.  Ten minutes after our second round of pizzas came the hostess came over and told us we needed to hurry up because they had another group coming in.  I told her we just received our food and she said they needed our tables for the next group and walked away.

We continued to eat and drink (we still had pitchers of soda that were over half full) and the hostess came back and wanted to know if we wanted our pizzas boxed up because they needed to start cleaning up our table. Parents started shuffling their children out. I told the hostess that this was rude and she asked me what did I expect her to do. She told me we could not tie up the tables all night. We had not even been sitting at our tables for an hour yet. It&#39;s one of those scenarios where you say, &#34;Did that just happen?&#34;

Tonight 4 of us went there and the host was a young man that looked like he was 13 or 14 years old.  We were waiting for a table for about 30 minutes. A group of 4 people came in and were seated in about 10 minutes. I approached the young host and told him that group came in after us and he seated him. The host told me we had not been waiting that long and that I needed to go sit back down with my group. Wow.

I went back to my group and we laughed about this teen putting me in my place.  A few minutes later ANOTHER group (3 people this time) walked in and was seated within minutes. I approached the host and told him this was unsatisfactory and he once again told me we had not been waiting that long and we should have a table soon. We walked out.

The bottom line is that this business is ran rather rudely.  If I was the owner I would be extremely concerned."

This was the destination of our November NW Suburban Dinner group. I selected it based on Renita M&#39;s recommendation and we certainly found a great place. Before we even got here, I wasn&#39;t sure how things would work out, as they don&#39;t do reservations on Tuesdays because they are so busy thanks to the 2-for-1 pizza special that day. Well, after talking to one of the Tree Guys, Anthony, I got there early to stake out a spot and to my pleasant surprise, they had a series of tables joined to accommodate our group.

Inside, it&#39;s not that big of a dining area but it is not cramped either. There is a fish tank on the counter as you come in. The walls are decorated with an Italian theme throughout the place. As I sat there waiting for the rest of the group to arrive, I was amazed at their diverse menu. It&#39;s not just pizza. There&#39;s burgers, hot sandwiches, seafood, pasta and all sorts of appetizers, soups and salads. In this idle time, I had to conduct a series of tournament style elimination rounds in my brain as I pitted menu items against each other to decide what to order. Pasta Fagioli soup had no chance against the overpowering might of the 3-meatball sandwich. Likewise, the beef &amp; sausage combo towered over the pasta dishes that I pondered. But in the end, perhaps by an upset, the jalapeno-parmesian burger prevailed, beating out the mushroom-swiss burger in its own division. A real Cinderella story... if Cinderella were a burger patty with all sorts of spicy things on it.

I don&#39;t think there was a bad thing on their menu. I had some of Alice&#39;s calamari appetizer. I also got me some cheesy garlic bread which had a thick layer of melted mozzarella on top. I got a look at Aimee&#39;s pasta fagioli and it looked amazing too. My burger was certainly a winner, with a coating of parmesian covering spicy pickled jalapeno slices. And the red onion slices on top packed a potent combination of flavor and heat between the buns.

I saved room for dessert and went for the tiramisu, which is my benchmark for Italian restaurants. Definitely big enough for two people, I saved some for home. The flavor was rich and cake-like, not too coffee-ish like at some places. Blooms of whipped cream adorned it from all sides.

Service was great the entire night, as we got our food and drinks quickly and the staff took good care of us. Tree Guys is a great place in the heart of Itasca and I certainly will stop back here if I am in the area for lunch or dinner."

The food was wonderful. And so was the service.

This little spot is sort of a pizza place/sports bar rolled up into one, very comfy, and a nice place to relax. I get a kick out of a man who, occasionally, likes to live dangerously and order for me. Tree Guys brings out the mellow in you.

We loved the veggie with garlic thick crust. Despite being a &#34;thin&#34; fan, I really loved the thick crust ... seemed like it had an additional infusion of garlic, so the more the merrier. We waited a bit, but no problem.

That gave me time to snoop at what the rest of the folks were engulfed in. The burgers looked phenomenal and a few of the pasta entrees I saw looked like something I would definitely get the next time.

And next time there shall be. There is much to be said about finding little neighborhood joints that go the extra mile in flavor and food because there is always an additional silver lining: the price! 

Tanks a lot, Tree Guys. Molto bene!"

However, we wanted something quick and simple...preferably pizza or wings. We initially tried to order from Lou Malnati&#39;s but could not get through to place an order, so of course, we went on Yelp. After reading the reviews and seeing what they had to offer, we decided to give it a try. Sholl&#39; hate it! I wish we had waited to get through to our favorite place.  :(

This review is a combination of customer service and food. I wish we could give &#34;negative&#34; stars...I really do, but 1 will have to suffice. I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve been treated so shabbily at an establishment. My husband and I drove there...on a Friday evening...in hopes of getting a quick bite to eat. We planned to pick our food  up and take it back to the hotel. 

When we got there, it was busy (of course) but we were totally ignored to the point where I had to get someone&#39;s attentions to even get a menu to look at. No one acknowledged our presence in the least. Walking past, hurrying away, no one spoke, smiled, or inquired if we needed help.  We went to stand at the cash register so as to get further information and/or ask question about an item on the menu. I started to speak to one of the ladies on wait staff and she walked away...while I was speaking to her!

To make a long (and painfully ridiculous) story short, after much ado, we finally got someone to take our order.  We went across the street to Starbucks, got our drinks, drank, dawdled, and dragged back over to pick up our order. When we got back (approx. 20-25 min. later) we had the same issue. We had to &#34;grab&#34; someone&#39;s attention to ask about the status of our order. Even after saying it was about to be ready, we still had to wait. 

At this point, due to the blatant rudeness and disregard, I was annoyed beyond measure, but hated to cancel the order and ask for our money back (plus we were hungry). I wish we had. Once we finally received our order, there was nothing remarkable about it. The chicken was bland (and the sauce was not good...major disappointment) and the pizza was so-so...at best. 

I truly value consideration and customer interaction, even if you are busy. It was inexcusable to be treated like that in an establishment where we spent our money.  After reading the reviews, we were looking forward to experiencing food from some place different. Although the food was nothing to write home about, the service (or lack thereof) left a sour taste in our mouths, and made it even less enjoyable. So you want my honest opinion? I&#39;ll give it to you. Combined with the horrific customer service, too-long wait, sub-par food, I feel like we wasted time...and money, and have no desire to go back...ever."

It&#39;s the kind of place that you can feel pretty comfortable the entire time you&#39;re there and everyone around you does too. This place meets all my expectations for a great neighborhood bar. The only reason they&#39;re missing a star is because the service is always just mediocre and the women&#39;s bathroom is kind of awkward.

Not sure what they normally serve, but what I saw was a fair variety made up of Italian sausage, beef, chicken wrap, pizza, fish, salad, and watermelon. Considering everything was above my normal expectations from buffets, I left happy and with money in my pockets.

Verdict: Better than your average buffet, and great service at the bar."

Yes, we live quite close by, but there are a lot of restaurants nearby -- and this is one of our favorites. 

It&#39;s hard to go wrong. It&#39;s a cute, homey place in a historic building in downtown Itasca, which is rather reminiscent of Mayberry. The staff is friendly and really on top of things and the menu is full of Italian favorites, pizza and comfort-food goodness.

Pizza ratings follow, but I have to say that their sandwiches and burgers are quite possibly the real star; some of the best burgers in the burbs and served with house-made chips or hand-cut fries.

Deep Dish (four stars):
Sauce: Chunky, zippy, not too sweet. Great flavor. 5 stars.
Cheese: Not oozing, but plentiful, with a great stretchy cheesy flavor. Yum. 4 1/2 stars.
Crust: Eh. Not amazing, needs some buttery-ness, but not bad either. 3 stars.

Thin Crust:
Bit crispy, plenty of cheese, decent crust. Overall, 4 stars. Thick crust is much the same, but takes a lot longer to cook and has a bready, chewy crust. I&#39;d stick with the deep or thin."

If you order pizza by the slice it is usually really old and stale. The Pub side is trash, but the restaurant is a step up from Pizza Hut.

Barbecue Pizza is good. 

It seems like the same townies are always at the bar.. You know the ones who are 26 and still live in their parents basement.

The waitress refused to tell my friend the specials. They usually give popcorn to the patrons- the other night the waitress didn&#39;t feel like making any after we even asked for some several times (she just dismissed the request). 

Try not to order any drinks that may take any measurement or special instructions to make, they will disappoint you. Stick to beer or something simple so that they don&#39;t jack it up so bad."

My inlaws eat here every Tuesday for their buy 1 get 1 free deal - that&#39;s right...buy one pizza - get another free - no coupon needed. 
Although we don&#39;t go with them every week...we have eaten here quite a few times. Their service is attentive, cute little pizzeria, and a fun bar to grab a few drinks and play darts in the back. 
Their pizza has some of the freshest ingredients that I have had on a pizza. The crust is crisp and the sauce is not overly sweet ...followed up by just enough cheese.

I enter through the back and I&#39;m along with a bunch of other people that are &#34;waiting&#34;.  There&#39;s a counter with 2 girls and 1 woman.  One is answering phones, one is on a computer and I discover through asking that the &#34;woman&#34; was the hostess.  Now I&#39;m standing at the counter kind of surveying the crowd and how busy they are patiently waiting for someone/anyone to acknowlege I am standing here and maybe a &#34;can I help you?&#34; A good 15 minutes goes by.  Then the &#34;hostess&#34; proceeds to call out a name.  I ask her &#34;are you the hostess?&#34;.  I get a snotty &#34;YES!&#34;.  Allrighty then.  She&#39;s already set the tone for me.  I tell her party of 2 and my name.  I wait another 10 minutes and decide you know...I don&#39;t really think this is starting out good and it&#39;s probably not going to end much better.

But, as many others have already noted, I feel like the create your own ***** (fill in the blank) fad a la chipotle has hit its saturation point.

This is another spin off of the create your own, assembly line food chains but for salads.

The salad itself tasted fine and fresh.  But, the options are so dizzying, that it get like halfway down the line I just wanted to finish getting the salad made and eat already.

I think it would be great if they had a handful of pre-determined salads that have been thoughtfully created that you could pick.  And if you liked one, you could come in and just order it and put some personal tweets to it by adding this or that.  And obviously have the option of creating one from scratch when you feel like it as they already do.

The food was good, other than the price, about $13 for a salad, with protein added, and a fountain drink.

In retrospect, I should have tried out one of their teas, to get a taste.

Due to the price, and again, feeling like its nothing special.  I&#39;d come back if I were in the area and someone wanted to try it.  But, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d proactively seek out eating here as a top choice.

We got to choose what we wanted, rather than most places where we need to ask to substitute for toppings that we don&#39;t care for.  The prices were comparable to any salad.  I had the mango dressing which was great.  My husband had the balsamic and he liked that too.  It was so good and we&#39;re looking forward to our next visit."

They have so many toppings and dressings to choose from. The balsamic dressing was delicious. I couldn&#39;t even finish the whole thing, so I would probably go for the smaller size next time.

I always welcome any healthy option in the &#39;hood. Today was opening day and my coworker &amp; I were lucky enough to be one of the first 50 there today granting us a free meal.

The entire staff was very welcoming and friendly which was a nice introduction to Salata, plus they had cool carrot &amp; broccoli balloon sculptures. Ha! 

I ended up trying their wrap today which they have 5 tortilla options for (I went with Thai Ginger), multiple green options (I had spinach &amp; kale) and tons &amp; tons of toppings. It&#39;s a choose your own adventure type of place allowing you to pick everything that goes into your wrap or salad from start to finish. Everything was so sanitary and clean, brightly colored fresh ingredients and it tasted really good, too! For me the portion was quite large and I have enough to eat for later. My friend gobbled up his entire salad but then he&#39;s a beastly man.

My favorite thing about Salata was their &#34;Tea Tap&#34;. I&#39;m a big tea drinker as I stay away from the bubbly stuff and loved having many fun options for tea from no calorie black teas to a delicious lemonade green tea option and everything in between - I think there were 7 options in total. I really liked this idea and haven&#39;t seen it at other fast casual restaurants. All you can drink, too!

My one sticking point with Salata is the price point and that&#39;s where I fear for them. I don&#39;t see this changing because they are a chain restaurant and I&#39;m sure the prices are mandating my corporate. Salads are $8, small salads are $7 and salad wraps are $7. Now these prices seem completely acceptable to me but where it gets rough is if you want protein - that will add $3 to your meal. Want avocado? Another dollar. Artichoke hearts? $1 homie. Ain&#39;t no wrap worth $12 to me. It is very delicious, very fresh and a fabulous healthy option but I think this may be slightly too rich for the Schaumburg blood. 

You can order your meal ahead so you can skip the line &amp; simply pick up. Sweet! Be sure to join their loyalty club! You will leave feeling full but satisfied and probably slightly better about yourself for not eating a greasy burger &amp; fries, but your wallet may be slightly upset with you."

We were surprised how empty is was for a Friday.  I guess this side of Schaumburg isn&#39;t is busy as the Streets of Woodfield or Meacham Rd area.

This place is brand new.  It is like a Chipolte but for salads and wraps.  The selection is unbelievable.  Choice after choice is available behind the counter.  Each station has a person who assembles your food like an efficient assembly line.

I chose the regular sized salad with turkey, a crap-ton of veggies, parmesan cheese, and ginger lime dressing.  I was happy to see soooooo many gluten free choices.  Yay.  My salad was delicious and my coworker said her salad was delicious.  We were both super hungry so we ate the whole dang thing.  (don&#39;t judge)

The fountain drink choices here are unique.  You can get diet or regular Mexican cola, plus 2 other regular sodas.  They also have a whole bunch of iced tea choices.  SCORE.  I love iced tea.  Half are regular sweetened and the other half are unsweetened.  I drank a diet Mexican cola and the unsweetened plum tea.  Both were great.

We will definitely be back...with a coupon or for a celebration.  The food here is not a bargain.  I spent $14 for my salad and soft drink.  I try to avoid spending that much for lunch.  I am not living the high life."

Well I brought the salad back, I got that regular one and my colleagues asked me if they started making small salads. They were totally cheap on the toppings. I spent $10.00 for what I would have paid $4 for at Wendy&#39;s. So I will NOT go back to this place."

That&#39;s a little crazy. There are many yogurt dressing options now in the 120-150 calorie range. 

Other than that, the other reviewers have said it all. Very good selection, super clean, a little pricey. Tea bar looked awesome but I didn&#39;t see it until I sat down. &#34;Is this your first time here?&#34; should be the first question, asked preferably by someone who speaks and understands English. 

The price bothered me a bit, but the protein options far outweigh other local salad bar selections, and the ingredients are obviously fresh. I will be back, but will leave off the $1 artichoke and will take it &#34;to go&#34; so I can add my own tasty lower-Calorie dressing."

So many different vegetables, fruits, meats, breads, and soups were there. The customer service as EXCELLENT. The area is just so clean and modern. Pictures of healthy foods ( they sold ) and beautiful glass murals.  The music is so cute and fun. The tea tap was cute but it seemed a little bit empty. Anyways, I rate this 5 out of 5.

Well you can add Salata to that list.  

The problem is, salad bars already exist, most notably and in close proximity, Sweet Tomatoes.  For me, a salad is a very personal food.  Why Salata thinks that having someone else put the wrong amounts of ingredients in my salad will work is beyond me.  I know I can&#39;t be the only person to experience this frustration because the person in front of me and the people behind me expressed the same frustration: &#34;No, beets, not turnips&#34; or &#34;I&#39;ll take some peas. More please. MORE please.&#34;  When you pay $7-8 for a salad and you can&#39;t come back for seconds, you get frustrated when the person behind the counter has been instructed to give pinches of each ingredient.

The woman in front of me asked for dressing on the side so they gave her one small container.  When she asked for more, they told her an additional container would be extra.  Okay.  When it was my turn, the guy went overboard with my dressing and put two heaping scoops overpowering the salad.  Of course I couldn&#39;t know that until they started to toss it and I realized that my entire salad was the color of the dressing.  Good grief.  What makes it okay to charge one person extra for the same amount of dressing that I was given AND ruin my salad in the process?

Want to add protein? That&#39;ll be $3 extra for chicken and $4 extra for seafood or turkey.  Want vegan protein? $3 bucks please. At least there&#39;s no extra charge for bacon.

It&#39;s hard to come down on a new business but I&#39;m gonna have to give this place two thumbs down for poor execution and inattention to very competitive options in the immediate area.  Panchero&#39;s, which is right next door, seems to be hanging on by a thread but they also have nobody to blame but themselves for opening up across the street from Chipotle.

Ugh, never again."

Anyhow, to me its completely tasteless and all the premade soups, etc. just don&#39;t cut it so I had to find somewhere new... I was blown away to find Salata. I must have driven by a hundred times and never saw it. I convinced the team to go and...

Great place - the ingredients actually taste like they should and appeared to be super fresh. I also prefer the assembly line style and someone else making my salad because it forces me to think about what is going in and keeps me from making a three bean salad over lettuce. I also tend to put too much dressing on. Some other great things - friendly staff, present management, a lot of tasty choices. 

I noticed some of the other reviews mentioned the cost as being an issue but to me, good, fresh food costs money and I don&#39;t mind paying for quality. I would have given it 5 stars if they had a hot chicken (protein) option. 

Can&#39;t wait to go back!"

That are a build your own salad type of place and its a great concept. If your picky about your salad like me this is the place because The options are pretty endless for protein and toppings you can choose from chicken, shrimp and even fish. The  kind women who prepared my salad was very patient and let me sample a few things and made a few suggestions as well. The ginger dressing is to die for its very delicious if you like your salads a bit sweet. I got the grilled chicken and was really good had flavor...some salads that comes with chicken is usually either dried out or tasteless. I couldn&#39;t believe how clean and pristine the place is the interior is nice and simple. They also have outdoor tables. Although it does get pricey for the add ons which I guess they have to make there money somehow but I hope this place lasts Bc a lot of places in that strip have not lasted.

I would choose this place over ST for a healthy lunch. Leisurely b&#39;fast / brunch on a Sunday, I am probably headed to ST. I wasn&#39;t a fan of their broccoli soup though.

The salad options all appeared fresh and well supplied and a very good variety of things you don&#39;t normally see at standard buffet type places. I had a basic salad and choose my toppings, a couple of times I asked for more and there was no issue with that. I didn&#39;t add the extra protein, not because of the cost but because it only comes cold. The portion was nice for the salad overall.  

My friend had the soup and she said it was very good. Both of us enjoyed our salads.

As for the beverages, they have a Mexican soda (didn&#39;t catch the name but was told it is healthier (reminded me of Diet Rite ick)  and a boat load of lemonades and teas on tap and some Coke products in bottles.  I would of much preferred to have the new Coke machines where anything goes, or a minimum a standard tea. 

There is a lot of seating and the place is well lite, but the booths could be bigger. They even have a few tables outside. 

I will be popping back in during lunch, as a nice option to the other places that are all along that area."

Who is it?

It&#39;s me Dave, I got the stuff, man... open up.

Dave&#39;s not here, man.

No, it&#39;s ME... DAVE... open up!



On the South side of the Metra UP/NW line in the quaint village of Mount Prospect lies a row of shops and restaurants that go virtually unnoticed by the masses that rip through town along Northwest Highway.

One of these fine shops is Dave&#39;s Specialty foods- a place to go when looking for a caterer for your wedding or family feast.

Aside from the professional services, they also have a fine selection of sandwiches and soups for lunch.

I brought my 5-yo son with me and we had a wonderful time.

The first thing you see is a refrigerated case full of various cheeses and unique beverages. The next case showcases some prepared foods, most notably, the bread pudding. A big hunk of dense bread and egg littered with chunks of dark chocolate and drizzled with a vanilla sauce of sorts. Pop it in the microwave for a few seconds and you will be instantly transported to your grandmothers kitchen- shhh-eating grin and all.

The sandwich selection was fair. I ordered the BBQ pork and my son had the tuna with a bag of tasty chips sans MSG, gluten, and hydrogenation. A couple of San Pelligrino sodas rounded out our meal.

The bread was thinly sliced and toasted to perfection. The bbq pork was tender, juicy, sweet, and tangy- delightful to say the least.

The tuna salad was fine. Creamy, tangy... Straight forward and equally delicious.

The decor is sort of eclectic with a hodgepodge of tables and chairs reminiscent of a deli of sorts.

The service was as friendly as you&#39;d expect from a Mt. Prospect joint. Smiles and free brownie samples always make our day.

The hours of operation are from 12-4 so stop on in for a tasty sandwich... without the Labrador."

The staff made our event run smoothly, eagerly assisting in any way to improve the quality of the event outcome and insure the guests were well attended to.  I enjoyed working with Dave&#39;s knowing with confidence something needing to be done would not go unnoticed and would swiftly be taken care of.  The attitude of this company is kindness not formality, relationships not rules mentality.  Great attention to detail and fantastic food create a seamlessly run event, creating wonderful lasting memories by all.  Many thanks for our successful family function."

It is a special (Golden) time for them and for her family!  We wanted it to be special in all areas from music to food, as you all know people walk away talking about the food.
We drove to Dave&#39;s and tried his sandwiches, we were not happy at all, you could not taste the chicken because the berries over-powered it, the pulled pork was nothing special and the PBJ sandwiches where made with Skippy PB.

We sat with him for about 30 minutes and gave him all the info in what we wanted in the food.  Over the period of 3 weeks, I had talked to him 4 times and every time I talked to him, he had no idea who I was or what I was doing calling him, granted we only meet once but I had talked to him 3 other times and every time I had to tell him my story of who, what, where, when and why. Sigh......

I will not be doing a tasting with him nor will I recommend him to any one and that bothers me because he has probably worked very hard to get to where he is.  On the other hand, his customer service was very poor in all areas.

This is my experience with him and I know others have had great experiences so for what it is worth to whoever reads this, don&#39;t judge Dave&#39;s by my review."

Everything was delicious and Dave, Sue, and his staff were great to work with, made everything easy for us, and the cost was great for what you get (excellent food at reasonable prices for wedding catering!)

We enjoyed our interactions with Dave and Sue. We even set up rentals of dishes, linens, etc. through them with another company upon our request. They took care of it  all which was a relief for us. They provided our bartenders for our open bar. Basically, they helped us pull off one of the best days of our lives with low stress.

Thank you for the great food and wonderful service!"

And it is one of the best memories of the day. From meeting Dave to planning with him to eating his delicious food to his very professional follow-up, I highly recommend him. 

Dave catered our wedding at the Byron Colby Barn. On their list of recommended caterers you&#39;ll find a wide variety. There are catering companies who do food, and real foodies who have grown into catering. Dave is the latter. He has a passion for food, he&#39;s an expert chef, and he has assembled a team to cater events very well. Plus, he is reasonably priced for such high-end food. 

Be prepared that the small store can get very busy and they can be slow in responding to emails.  But don&#39;t let that freak you out. In retrospect, with all my wedding vendors, I&#39;ve found what matters most is the day-of performance, followed by the ease of planning. Whenever I spoke with Dave it was a fun, easy process, and he gave me a lot of expert planning advice (mixed with funny anecdotes to illustrate his points!) On the day, his crew arrived and set up the space on time and as planned. As he put it: &#34;You may have a lot of people there to help, but we arrive prepared to do it all.&#34; He also did us a few huge logistical favors above and beyond the job. 

Above all, the food was spectacular. We had brisket that just crumbled under the fork, sweet &amp; tender mango chicken, colorful spinach salad that is not the generic spinach salad you&#39;re thinking of, his signature risotto cakes, fresh fruit, herb-roasted veggies and . . . I missed the hors d&#39;ourves while taking photos, but our guests still talk about them, especially the cheese puffs!"

We had Dave cater our wedding. We met with him back in January while looking for caters and we fell in love with him instantly. His food is fantastic and he&#39;s so easy going. The whole process was a breeze. We had about 140 people at our wedding and we did passed appetizers during cocktail hour and then a dinner buffet. The appetizers were insanely delicious as was the buffet dinner. People raved about the food the whole night and the service was impeccable.

If we ever need to do another catered party Dave will be the only one we call.  Thank you Dave for making our wedding fabulous!! 

You should seriously consider Dave&#39;s Specialty Foods for any event."

We had 30 people  and he was the only one really interested in such a small affair. I was hooked the second I tried his food! In fact I canceled another tasting I had scheduled for the next day because I knew Dave&#39;s was the right decision. 

I love, love, loved his food! Service at the wedding was amazing. his staff was friendly and helpful. The food was all incredibly beautiful and well presented.

I couldn&#39;t ask for a better caterer than Dave&#39;s Specialty Foods.  They treated us like family from the second we walked in their shop.  We met with Dave 3 times to set our menu.  We went with the buffet which featured chicken in wild mushroom sauce, boneless beef short-ribs in a lingonberry sauce, garlic and herb roasted potatoes, roasted veggies, spinach salad, and a variety of breads.  People raved about the buffet, I was especially happy with the beef, it was so tender and cooked with love.  We also ordered for appetizers the cheese puffs (a knockout!), risotto cakes (amazingly good!), and crab cakes (didn&#39;t get a chance to try but they crowd said delicious).  The staff was so well organized and very pleasant.  I have to give a shout out to the bartenders they hired, they rocked!  The bottom line is that Dave&#39;s is very accommodating, friendly, willing to work in a budget, and most of all makes great food and  has exceptional service.  Weeks after the wedding people are still telling me how good the food was.  Dave&#39;s is the real deal and I would suggest them for any party and the deli in the shop is a hidden gem."

Boasting 60 types of cheeses and a huge variety of specialty foods, only a small amount of stuff is available in store. You need to order in advance or get them to cater in order to buy more things. Only about a dozen cheeses (the ones there were good), 2 meats (Busseto dry salami and some pate), like 5 pre-made meals, some preserves, and whatever stuff they were serving for lunch. There was a considerable amount of wasted space. Despite this, I WILL be coming here for a cheese tasting sometime in the future."

He worked on the menu both times with us and gave us ideas that weren&#39;t on it that would better suit our needs. We received many compliments for both events.  Only drawback is that it may not be as much food as you would get from another caterer, but the flavor makes up for it. Also, we had a hungry crowd and people ate more of it because it was tasty! Plan a few weeks ahead to get exactly what you want. He will even make the meal for you to come in and taste/take home. Highly recommended for any catering event."

I threw a special surprise B-day party for my wife and invited 40 of her lifetime friends. 
All the typical restaurants and wineries were booked so a friend recommended Dave&#39;s.  It was local and it was special.  We met Dave and Sue and they immediately took a personal interest in the theme of the party and our plans. They helped with suggestions of very unique and eclectic choices for appetizers, and other dishes. 
The rumaki, the cheese puffs and everything were interesting and delicious. Moreover, Dave&#39;s supplied a fantastic staff of bartender and server that set up tables, the bar and made everyone at home. They completely cleaned up, packaged leftovers and took down tables so we had no followup work left to do. The reasonable quoted prices for food and services were fair, and maintained.  By providing our own wine and liquor, with Dave&#39;s help, our party was a huge success and far more reasonable and personable than any restaurant or banquet room..  Not only will I call Dave&#39;s first for any future events, but my guests indicated they would too.."

She recommended Dave&#39;s Specialty Foods because she had attended several of his cooking classes at her local library and thought the food was AMAZING and Dave was fun! I went on his website and looked at the menu options and pictures of his &#34;Party Room&#34; and decided it was the perfect place for our wedding. It definitely was the right decision. From the very beginning, Dave returned ALL my e-mails and phone calls and between my husband, me, and Dave&#39;s recommendations, we came up with a menu that was FABULOUS! I have to admit, another sister was VERY concerned that I would decide to have the reception at Dave&#39;s Party Room after she checked it out for me. After seeing the pictures the first sister sent me and her high recommendation of Dave, we decided to go for it. The reception was absolutely perfect!!! Even the sister with the serious issues with the way the place looked prior to the reception was AMAZED at how it all came together. EVERYONE raved about the food and service (Dave was our chef and server). He is so much fun:-D I could NOT imagine having our reception anywhere else. Thanks to my sister Linda for recommending the place and to Dave for a memorable day!!!"
daves-specialty-foods-mount-prospect,Laura T.,G6SNxGPGYXWpIhFh-gmWGg,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,2,316,wRvCuq8GGQMzGmaxyYuAgA,1.0,2011-01-20,"My friend decided to have her wedding downtown at an art gallery last autumn and after looking into a couple of other caterers earlier in the spring, she decided upon Dave&#39;s Specialty Foods.  What a huge mistake.  Because i helped her in the entire planning of the wedding and reception, I can tell you first hand that he nearly ruined her special day.

Firstly, in the preceeding six months to the wedding, getting a hold of Dave or his staff on the phone was next to impossible.  many times it took him nearly TWO WEEKS to call us back, even after we had left numerous messages.  For whatever reason, he doesn&#39;t delegate much of the preliminary work to his staff, so all the meetings have to go through him.  At first, his hippie &#34;groovy girls&#34; attitude was fun but it soon became very annoying given that he would always try to make excuses for not returning calls.  More than once we talked about dropping him and using another caterer, but my friend had already put down a hefty down payment, so we stayed with him.  Again, BIG MISTAKE.

So, if his lack of communication wasn&#39;t bad enough, the week prior to the wedding he was over  45 minutes late for the walk through at the gallery.  And he didn&#39;t even call us to let us know he would be late!   The only reason we stuck around to wait for him was because it was in preparation for the MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF MY FRIENDS LIFE.  Finally, when he finally did arrive, all the concerns we brought up as potentially problematic ie) having oranges for the Blue Moon, having enough ice for the bar, etc... he simply kept responding, &#34;don&#39;t worry about it, girls, it will be all taken care of.&#34;

Well, the day of the wedding arrived.  Dave and his staff were over ONE HOUR LATE to the venue.  UNREAL.  And he didn&#39;t have ANY oranges or enough ice for the bar!!  His staff and, in particular, the pregnant bartender, were UNBELIEVABLY RUDE to both the bride and party, who were obviously a bit angry that they were so late.  The food was average.  It wasn&#39;t horrible, but I have certainly had better.  But the point is that the food should have made up for the horrible service...but it didn&#39;t even come close.  At one point, me and my friends cousin started helping the staff bus the dirty plates from the tables.  Again, UNREAL.  The food was not horrible, but not great either.  Not one of the guests came up to any of us and said &#34;Wow, great food.&#34;  the only comments we heard were &#34;What is up with that Bartender?!&#34;  The reception was simply passed appetizers and buffet dinner with an open bar, how difficult can that be?  This is a catering company afterall, isn&#39;t this what they do for a living?!?

With so many other caterers out there who will bend over backwards for your business, don&#39;t waste your time and money on these guys.  It really is a waste.  There are so many other caterers who get fanstastic reviews all the time.  Dave and his staff nearly ruined my friends wedding.  If it weren&#39;t for an absolutely beautiful day and the guests being very chill, it would have been a disaster."

Both the food and Dave himself are awesome.  Here&#39;s a guy who not only has a passion for food, but also major people skills.  Everything he makes is delicious, including the to-go sandwiches.  He also stocks a great selection of cheese.  While places like this are a little more common in the city, it&#39;s a rare find in the northwest suburbs, and is sorely needed in that area.  People must be getting on the bandwagon, because Dave just moved to a bigger location!"

The place became a joke because they are the rudest people when they answer the phone like they are being bothered by you calling and when you get the chicken fried rice it&#39;s so kind of them to give you two little pieces of chicken instead of one.

Have also picked up orders from here. Always ready and still nice and hot. 

The food is better than most Chinese food restaurants.

We will continue to order from here on a regular basic and I would recommend it to anyone as well!!"

The food is always delicious and prompt.  The people delivering are always really nice and understanding (it&#39;s hard to find my house!).  The people who answer the phone are helpful and knowledgeable about what they think would be too spicy for me (I am so lame that I think the mild sauce at taco bell is too hot! *hangs head in shame*).

The food has always arrived piping hot--the eggroll I had delivered yesterday was so fresh and hot that I couldn&#39;t even eat ir right away because of all the steam!!  And the donuts are delicious!!

Also, I ordered at 12:30 yesterday and was told it would be 30 minutes.  Less than 20 minutes later, my delicious food arrived--that&#39;s quick service!

And $5.50 for a LOT of sesame chicken, fried rice, and eggroll AND a pop?!  How can you go wrong?!"

The woman who answered had the thick accent like everyone said but seemed to understand me. She wanted to be careful about taking down our delivery address and placed the driver on the phone to write it down.

The bargain:

We could order the $5.50 lunch special includes rice ( plain or fried), an egg roll and can of soda.

We ordered
Chicken Egg Foo Young
Sweet and Sour Chicken 
Chicken Chop Suey

everything was properly cooked. I want to note that one reviewer stated his vegetables were cut too big. Mine appeared cut smaller like slaw style with the carrots. Broccoli was small and edible everything was perfectly cut.

everything was well flavored and delicious.

The delivery: The order arrived at 1:45. Delievry driver was courteous
It was cold outside (28 degrees).  I note this because another reviewer noted waiting an hour for delivery. 

For barely 20 dollars and change ( before tip). This was cheaper than our average fast food jaunt or a morning at Starbucks."

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE HAD SINCE MOVING TO STREAMWOOD. My first order with this place ever the guy who took my order completely forget my portion of the order.  When I called to point it out, he said they didn&#39;t charge me for it.  Well, the guy clearly remembered that I ordered it because I asked if they could make it non-spicy and when he said yes than I said I&#39;d order a small.  He had no answer as to why he forgot it.  I would have paid for a replacement if they would have delivered it but he told me that it would be 45 minutes (I live five minutes away).  I would have gladly driven there to pick it up if it was no charge since it was clearly his error, but he wouldn&#39;t do that either.  At that point I was so angry and hungry I hung up in tears.  My husband called back and asked to speak to the manager but was told he wouldn&#39;t be in until Wednesday and the guy that was there and in charge didn&#39;t speak English.

If you like sweet and sour sauce ask for extra packets, they only give you a few.  On the flip side, they tend to give too many soy sauce packets in my opinion.

Decent Chinese food outside of the city limits is a rarity. How fortuitous, then, that I have TWO awesome Chinese joints within delivery range of me? If you guessed DAMN fortuitous then you guessed correctly!  

China Cook could steam some styrofoam and serve it on a bed of broken glass and I&#39;d eat it with relish. They could bring me empty boxes that just SMELL like their food and I&#39;d dine with glee. China Cook is some of the best Chinese food I&#39;ve had, burbs or otherwise. Firstly, their Mongolian Beef/Chicken comes with those crunchy little white noodles and anyone that&#39;s ever read a Chinese food Yelp of mine knows that&#39;s worth 5 stars all by itself, but that&#39;s not all China Cook does well. 

Their customer service is specta-frickin-cular. They actually give a crap about their customers and it shows both in the food as well as how fast and hot the food gets to us. They&#39;ve given us free egg rolls in the past, they also gave us a freakin&#39; wall calendar for the Chinese New Year. These things cost them virtually nothing but it&#39;s gotten them hundreds of dollars in business that might&#39;ve gone elsewhere. 

Aside from the Mongolian factor, I can personally recommend the Pineapple Chicken with its sweet, creamy sauce and succulent pineapple, the Four Seasons special, the Lucky 7 special as well as the Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp - all really delicious. 

They&#39;re located off Irving Park Road, tons of parking and really no space to eat there so order carryout or delivery and you&#39;ll thank me. China Cook - way better than your typical Chinese and a frickin GEM here in the Northwest burbs."

I was working from home and since this place was only across the street from me decided to have my food delivered.   I looked at their website and was pleasantly surprised to see so many lunch options for only $5.50 which included an egg roll and a can of soda !!!  

So I called them and placed the order, but I asked them if delivery was going to take more than 15 minutes, I would rather pick it up as Im only across the street. Honestly,  I didn&#39;t really feel like stepping outside in the cold weather.  They informed me that it would only take a few minutes to deliver so I went ahead and have them deliver it.  After 30 minutes, I called them back and they told me it was on their way.  Thinking the place was only across the street from my house, I thought they would be right outside my door any minute so I waited by the window.  Another 15 minutes go by and still not there.  I called them again to inquire and they informed me that delivery was slow due to bad weather...What a Joke !!!!  I had to laugh at his excuse, because it had not snowed in the past few days, and the road was clear of snow and it was a sunny day.  After another 20minutes, the food finally arrived.  I asked the delivery person why he was so late, and he informed me that the other delivery guy did not show up.  

I can understand now why my order took more than an hour to deliver, but I wish the owners would have been honest with me.  I really would have just picked up the order as I was famished by the time I got my order; and by the way, the food was cold.  I had to reheat the food in the microwave.  I have to admit though, the portions were huge and my Egg Foo Young was pretty delicious.    I just got turned off with the LIES which left me with a bad impression of the place."

Hidden in a suburban strip mall around the corner from Target. I cant say its the holy grail of Chinese Take out that I have been seeking but its as good or better than what&#39;s in the area.  One big advantage they have is their prices, really a bargain.  Crab Rangoon were crisper than most but well executed, cant say the same for the egg rolls, something was a bit off, maybe a overpowering taste of cabbage...not sure. Since it was my first time I figured I give them a hard test right away, Chow Foon is not something I see allot and it was respectable, the noodles were missing the &#34;wok hei&#34; that really makes them special. My wife had the General Tao&#39;s witch was bordering on overly breaded but had a nice glaze not overly sauced and pleasantly spicy...why is it most places that list dishes as spicy never are?

The friendliness and efficiency in which she took my order was astonishing. The food was pretty good and service was quick as well for a busy Saturday night. Another sweet blonde girly made me a delicious strawberry-banana smoothie, props to china cook for being the only place in miles where I can get a decent smoothie with tapioca.  Hiring some fresh faces really changed my mind about the service of this place. Those girls were BOMB.COM
The only thing that kept me from rating this place 5 stars were the 2 incredibly rude kids who are always sitting in the front.

I&#39;ve had their egg rolls which are actually not too bad, but I&#39;m sure could be a bit better. Spring Rolls are actually a lot better executed.  Being filipino, you get to liking spring rolls. Ahh lumpia! Ahem, anyway I digress(btw, I am a Chicago born filipino, so, I can&#39;t speak tagalog. :))

Their fried rice is also good. My children love eating it.  Their General Tso&#39;s chicken is awesome it is not too overly laden with the sauce and the lightly coated chicken is still a bit crisp to the bite. 

China Cook&#39;s Lo Mein is also very flavorful everything tastes fresh and I will agree with Paul O. as they cook with a LOT of onions.  I swear I&#39;m picking onions out in a large pile from some of their dishes. They do have a website, but it isn&#39;t much. I&#39;ve not been their lately  because my husband and I are on a low carb diet(well, when we&#39;re really following it), so we have not been to China Cook in a long time.

The wonton soup is flavorful and very filling. On top of that the General Tso&#39;s chicken is the best I have ever had.

The lady at the counter was very pleasant and our food came out very quickly.  By the time we sat down and crack open our pops our egg rolls were brought to us by the same lady with your typical 3 PC sauces (soy, spicy mustard, and sweet&amp;sour).  The egg rolls were nice and crispy, but bit on the salty side if you ask me.  No worries.  Then came General Tso and his army of fried rice steaming from all sides of the TO GO styrofoam containers. When we opened the containers the mystic steam put us into chow mode.  Yes, being Asian I should have taken a picture or two, but my brain was saying eat me!

The service was nice. Our server filled my water 3 times which was great, and kept the table clean. 

The food was good.  There was a yummy beef teriyaki, that was steak cooked to med rare perfection.  There were these cheesy shell things that had onion in them and those were good too. Everything else was quiet yummy for a buffet. I&#39;m only knocking a star because the sushi was room temperature and the fish in it wasn&#39;t the freshest. We went at the end of the lunch rush so that may have been the reason. Overall it was a nice experience."

Time of my visit: Around lunch

This was my first time here.  My mechanic lives near by and I figured I kill time while I wait for my breaks to get changed.

Let me say, the place was huge!  We were led inside and sat in the booth.  The first thing I got was some sushi and some meat on the stick!  Love sushi!  They had some nice sushi selection and it was good!

My next plate came from Mongolian grill.  I chose stake and some noodles with veggies.  To my BIG surprises the stake was good!  It was not rubber (sorry to say I was expecting that from a buffet), but rather tender and nicely done!

My final dish was some sea food.  And that was good!  I had some ocean sized shrimps!  Well done, well seasoned.

Now, here was where I ran into problems... It took forever to get water refilled...  And then bill arrived...  I was under impression that the buffet was about $12, apparently not on the weekends, but rather Monday-Friday...  Our bill was $60 and change (with tax) for two people.  $30 a person was a LOT!

Based on the the bill, I am gonna knock a star.  I am not sure if it&#39;s the same buffet Monday-Friday, but if it is, it&#39;s definitely WORTH it!  B-!"

Food was mediocre. The crawfish were awfully salty and had to be diluted with warm water. I didn&#39;t even bother getting half a lobster. It was ridiculous that you also had to wait in the same line to get crab legs (not many wanted those). Line moved super slow. It took around ten minutes for the line to move at one point. 

I suppose it was worth the money though since they had fresh sushi. They also had some dim sum items, but nothing particularly outstanding. I enjoyed the mini creme brulee. Green tea crepes also tasted decent. Overall, this place had quite the variety of Asian foods (sushi, seafood, Mongolian grill, dim sum, etc.). 

Service was so-so. I spent most of my time waiting in line to get food so I didn&#39;t really get to see our waitress. Everyone else there looked unhappy/stressed out though. It&#39;s a buffet, so I guess it&#39;s understandable. Royal Buffet is an okay place to go to if you&#39;re starving and you want okay food but if you want to have a decent dinner with family or friends you&#39;re better off somewhere else... Somewhere less crowded and noisy and messy. 

Definitely not the best seafood/sushi buffet I&#39;ve visited but it wasn&#39;t terribly bad either. Might be back if I&#39;m in the area but probably won&#39;t ever go out of my way to return."

If you don&#39;t like seaf5, they also have dim sum, many variations of chicken, beef, rice you name it, it&#39;s here.

Food is fresh cooked. It is a busy buffet, so the food never sits. Who wants dried out old food? Royal missed 5 stars because they run out of lobster and crab pretty fast. It&#39;s usually 20 minutes before the next batch is ready.

I really appreciate how they personally have a worker passing out the crab legs to ensure everyone gets their fair share. More places need to do that."

Food stuff that caught this happy Asian girl&#39;s attention: 油条, variety of dim sum, (chicken feet, egg tarts, pork belly, dumplings, buns, etc.) roast duck, sashimi, cold peel n&#39; eat shrimp, raw oysters, and lots of baked and pan fried fish.  But it quickly became apparent once I started eating, however, that because the focus is so highly on the crab and lobster, that most of the other stuff was highly neglected.  Yes, the employees would stir the food around once in a while but everything was on the cold side especially the dim sum items which I felt like I was the only one eating it.  It was like seeing a gorgeous girl from across the room.  But once you go in for a closer look you see the wig on her head slowly sliding off, the mascara smeared all over her eyes and her nappy toes poking out of her open-toe boots like they&#39;re throwing up gang signs.  Seriously, the sashimi looked like it was hacked off the fish with a dull butter knife and the roast duck just made me sad. That being said, I still ate enough sashimi to make Japan proud and focused my attention only on items that look like it had been rotated recently.  The variety of food here is definitely amazing, but the quality was lacking.  

Tip: If you&#39;re not really into lobster then don&#39;t come on Wednesdays and Fridays.  I like crab legs more than lobster but was in the area and it&#39;s really only a buck more.  No crab legs during lunch though."

Being a Taiwanese, I love all kinds of Asian cuisine. I want a little dim sum, some Chinese, a few pieces of sushi and grilled meat and etc... This place has it all! They have good dim sum selection, sushi, sashimi, Mongolian cooking, soups, Chinese entrees, fruits and desserts. 
My husband and I went back after three years and still were amazed by how much selection it has and enjoyed our meal. He took as much as sashimi as he could find and I tried their half lobster. It was decent. 
With the variety, the price is acceptable. We paid 70 including tips for two of us. We will have to wait till we are really hungry to visit again."

On one hand, it&#39;s a pretty great deal, for the variety of food you get for the price you pay.

On another hand, the food can be hit or miss. This isn&#39;t going to be your luxury Vegas buffet.

Overall though, my experiences at Royal Buffet have been relatively pleasant, and I have not had to deal with any rude linejumpers, overly aggressive eaters, or food-induced illnesses. 

Royal Buffet&#39;s selection of Asian cuisine resembles a mix of dim sum, sushi, authentic Chinese food, and Panda express -ish food. There&#39;s also a nice dessert bar with some neat selections for ice cream (green tea!) 

I&#39;m never actually able to eat enough to recoup what I paid, but I certainly leave extremely full. I also have only come here for lunch, but I don&#39;t believe that the options are different from those served at dinner (Except lobster? or crab legs?)

Royal Buffet is arguably one of the better buffets in the area, and if you&#39;re REALLY CRAVING Chinese food, then Royal Buffet provides the best bang for your buck."

None of the food was that memorable. Honestly, for $25 i was expecting a lot, because with tax and tips, you rack over a $30 bill here for 1 person.
When you first come in, you see a majestic indoor pond/fountain. Surprisingly the fish were not really moving, i guess the weather is too cold out. It really bugs me that they let people throw coins into the koi pond, the copper is terrible for the fish. The water level also looks lower than necessary, maybe they dont want people touching the fish. But i do have to give them props for ample space for the fish, probably the only asian restaurant that i know that does that. Minus one deflated helium balloon sitting on the fake rocks. 

Mongolian stir fry, nothing spectacular, did not try, because it did not look appealing enough to try.

Sushi bar. Yes they have sashimi sushi here but they were not that fresh. Tuna, salmon, mackerel, white tuna and white fish. Myriad other sushi rolls, not that amazing, did not taste authentic. 

Yes they have dim sum, but none of it was amazing. They also have peking duck, inside of buns with yellow chives, they were tasty but if you eat more than 1 you&#39;re already 25% done with your meal. 

They have tripe, pig ears, beef stomach and such. The pig ears were my fave, nicely executed. Cripsy, mixed in with some nice spices. 

They also have chinese soup, i dont mean the egg drop soup stuff, though weirdly enough they dont have egg drop soup. They do have this mushroom with winter melon soup with chinese medicine. Stay away from the sea food soup, dont know what is in there but tasted terrible. 

They have crab legs and raw oysters. Though the oyster on the shell were not that fresh, nothing like the ones i get bu the dozen at the bar. 

Chocolate fondeau fountain (marshmellow, banana, wafers). Ice cream (not self serve, they serve you), cotton candy. 

The set up of the restaurant was weird, this whole place is a buffet place why am
I seated at a hibachi grill? Lady did refill my water pretty periodically but took away my water for a while and after she brought it back out, gave it to the next table, say what?! I sure hope whoever got it did t drink it because i just got over a bad case of the flu.

Anyway, for the price, it did not wow me off my socks. Owned by chinese owners, this place looked packed enough for a monday evening that i was there. Now i can say i&#39;ve tried this place, will i be back? Probably not."

The sushi rolls are your standard selection, but the sashimi was good, as were pretty much all the hot foods.  Stir fry had tons of options to choose from, and the desserts alone are worth a trip back, especially the cotton candy and the green tea ice cream.

In my opinion, the price is justified with what&#39;s offered.  You just have to make sure you come hungry."

This time... not so much. Everything started nicely. We were seated quickly and the waiter got us our drinks. It was busy at the buffet but there were still a lot of choices. I was able to get in line and get some crab legs although by the time I got to the front of the line, I only received 2 pieces instead on the piles of crab I saw on others plates.

The thing that killed this experience for me was the wait staff. Our waiter only showed up to clear plates. As we sat for over an hour, we didn&#39;t get a single refill until he came to drop off the checks and we had to ask for more drinks. The waiters were all sitting at a table a couple tables away from us and there were on their phones. While we were leaving, my friends and I decided to look at what they were doing on their phones, and they were playing Pokemon Go.  I feel that when someone is on the clock and being paid for helping customers, they should not be playing games on their phones.

While I do love Royal&#39;s food, I am hesitant to go back to a restaurant that lacks customer service and an attentive staff."

The prices are really good and the variety is amazing. I came for the first time for the lunch deal and was not disappointed.

The thing that I really like about Royal Buffet is that I know in the future that I can come here and can always find something that I like. I don&#39;t even need to know what I&#39;m craving that day but will always find it once I&#39;m inside and am customizing my own plates. When I&#39;m looking for more savory hot foods, I&#39;ll go for the Mongolian barbecue (I recommend the garlic sauce), and depending on how light or heavy I want it, I&#39;ll choose my meats/veggies accordingly. On the opposite end, if I&#39;m looking for a lighter, less oily meal, I head towards the sushi and sashimi bar, where there&#39;s tons of variety in what kinds of sushi are available (fair warning: the sushimi selection was not nearly as big). Then there&#39;s a whole selection of hot Chinese food and dim sum that sates my appetite for anything in between. 

The buffet is no Michelin star (who goes to a buffet expecting that anyway?) but if you&#39;re looking for a great meal and a customizable experience, I&#39;d say this is really the best bang for your buck."

The quality of the food here is pretty low. For the $70 for 2 I could have had a way better meal at Bahama Breeze just down the street. 

I tried to eat food at the dessert bar but couldn&#39;t figure out what I was looking at so I didnt eat any of it.

First of all, you have lots to choose, sushi, seafood, Chinese or American,by American I mean salad and fried food. Within each category, you will still be left with many options. For example, the sushi bar made me full within the first 10 mins. 

Second, although with a great amount, the food quality doesn&#39;t compromise. I tried all kinds of fish, fried Chinese dish, dim-sum, dissert, even cotton candy. They all taste very good to me. One little thing is, we arrived super early for Friday lobster night. 5:30 pm! The line was already long and I would like to say, I&#39;m not a big fan of the crab and lobster. 

Third, the surroundings and atmosphere in this place are also great. Families come. Very kid-friendly. The waitresses are so fast about helping you get rid of the full old plates. I think just everyone loves to hang here.

I&#39;m used to your local Chinese buffet having a few decent items and basically just being a place to stuff your face and get full on average Americanized Chinese food. You&#39;d have your sweet n sour chicken, general tso&#39;s, beef with broccoli, crab rangoon, and if you&#39;re lucky they&#39;d have a soft serve machine for dessert. That&#39;s about it. 

I guess times are a changin&#39;. Royal buffet is a Chinese buffet on steroids. They literally have everything you could think of, providing more variety than you&#39;d ever need. Let&#39;s start off with just the general hot food section. They have your typical Chinese chicken/beef/shrimp dishes. Throw in a couple American dishes like french fries and chicken fingers for the kids and you&#39;re already satisfied right? This section alone could&#39;ve already beat any of the Chinese buffets from my childhood. But nope, they didn&#39;t stop here...they&#39;re just getting started. 

Moving on, they have a separate line for seafood. This is where it gets chaotic. Just a massive line of people, each leaving gigantic piles of crab legs on their plates. It seems like they never run out either. It&#39;s a little bit more organized now, with much less people cutting than in the past. I guess this is the star of the show, the real reason most people come here and are willing to pay such a high price for a buffet. 

After that, there was a sushi station. It seemed to have a lot more variety than most offerings I&#39;ve seen at other buffets. I don&#39;t really eat sushi, so I can&#39;t comment on the quality. 

Next to that is the dim sum section. This is where we really stray from the typical Americanized food I&#39;m used to at Chinese buffets. I can&#39;t really say I&#39;m a connoisseur on authentic Chinese food, so I haven&#39;t even heard of a lot of these items. I&#39;ll admit they were a little intimidating and I didn&#39;t really try most of them, so I just stuck to the shumai, buns, and chive pancakes. I enjoyed the food I did try from this section though.

On the end is the stir fry station. This is really the highlight of the place for me. I&#39;ve been to really good Mongolian stir fry places that had a sorry excuse for a buffet, and I&#39;ve been to Chinese buffets that had pretty terrible quality hibachi grills / stir fry stations. Royal buffet kind of has the best of both worlds. What I typically look for with stir fry is a good variety of sauces that you can mix yourself, decent quality meat, and being able to choose your own noodles and load up as much of it as you want on your plate. Royal has all of these, and actually does make a really good plate of stir fry in my opinion. With the closure of Mongolian Stir fry in Schaumburg (I&#39;m still sad about this one), Genghis Grill in Wheaton, and Mongolian Chinese Buffet in Buffalo Grove, this is literally the only place left that I know of where you can get decent stir fry. 

Finally, they have a pretty good dessert selection here. There are trays of various pastries and mini slices of cakes and pies. In addition to those, they have a few varieties of hand scooped ice cream you can choose from. These last few items are where they just get flat out ridiculous. There is a station where you can get fresh made crepes and customize what they&#39;re filled with. Then they also have freshly spun cotton candy, which is a huge hit with the kids. Finally they have a freakin&#39; chocolate fountain! Who does that? They have various fruits and other items on skewers that you can pass through the gloriously flowing chocolate.  

In terms of dining area, the actual space of the restaurant is gigantic. They have like 3 or 4 separate dining rooms. I&#39;m not sure what the capacity is, but they easily reach it at busy times, especially on holidays like Mother&#39;s day. It&#39;s just a sea of Asian people flooding the restaurant. 

Overall, Royal buffet is kind of like a Vegas style Chinese buffet. It seems to be the king of the mega Asian buffets in the Chicago burbs, outlasting both Todai and Nagoya. I usually don&#39;t come here often because I&#39;m not a huge seafood fan and I don&#39;t really take advantage of most of the items that make this place unique from other generic Chinese buffets. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a good place to celebrate a special occasion, but given the higher price tag, I probably wouldn&#39;t come here regularly."

But as everyone (myself, wife, teen daughter, 2year old toddler) all suffered through the night and this morning with headache, stomach aches, and diarrhea (thankfully, no vomiting, but all seem like classic food poisoning symptoms to me), I have no choice but to give it 1 star. I would give it ZERO if that were an option,

Not really sure what made us sick, but it probably wasn&#39;t the raw fish as our kids didn&#39;t have any of that but still got sick. At the time, the food was generally delicious and seemed fresh accept for a few sushi rolls which were very fishy tasting. 

One thing I did notice was one of the attendants prying open the closed large cooked clams. For those who don&#39;t know, it is generally recommended (for food safety reasons) that one should not eat shellfish like clams which hasn&#39;t opened up during cooking as this indicates that the animal was already dead, and not fresh. Apparently, when cooked alive and fresh, they  reflexively open up. Unfortunately, I noticed this unnerving practice in my &#34;second round&#34; and after I had already eaten several!

Have to also mention that the dessert line was outrageously long as was the Hibachi. My daughter disappeared for 20 minutes at one point so I went looking for her. She had been waiting in line with a big plate of ingredients the whole time for the hibachi. Then she arrived at the table another 10 minutes later with a tiny portion of burned noodles and vegetables. I asked her if she had eaten her food on the way back. But that&#39;s all she got from the cook.

Finally, I was waiting for the sashimi at one point, and I watched the &#34;chef&#34; slicing salmon for a few minutes, and then set it aside. When I asked if I could have some, he told me it was not for this meal service. What?! Then why are you preparing that now, rather than taking care of the EMPTY sashimi tray at this meal service?!

I&#39;ve been to RB many times in the past, but this was my first time back for a few years. Might be a few more before I go back. Now where&#39;s that Pepto Bismol?"

In both cases, there&#39;s a variety of stir-fry dishes; focusing more on the seafood side than on chicken or beef. There are also appetizers like spring rolls and pot stickers. There&#39;s a couple of soups - I generally get hot and sour. There are over a dozen different sushi options; about a dozen nigiri options; about 6 sashimi options; fresh oysters, clams, and mussels, and some pickled vegetables. There&#39;s also a &#34;mongolian style&#34; food bar where you pick the ingredients and they cook it up. There are a few authentic dishes that are foreign to westerners that I couldn&#39;t really tell you what they are. Finally, there&#39;s several types of fresh fruit; several desserts; ice cream and enough tables and choices to make this place packed.

For dinners they bring out crab, sometimes lobster, and augment some of the selections.

The food is quite good for a buffet - I&#39;d give it 5 stars except the price is on the high side - of course if you pig out on lobster or sashimi - you&#39;ll exceed your money&#39;s worth."

A small hiccup with having one employee to both dish ice cream and make crepes, and having the plates right where people wait for ice cream, but every item I had was fine.

Now, for the bad. Nearly every item I had for dinner was of poor quality, with the best being &#34;okay&#34; and the worst being &#34;worst I&#39;ve ever eaten.&#34; Pieces of nigiri were dry and tasteless, many items were somehow both dry and greasy, and the oysters had a taste that reminded me of the smell of a poorly maintained pet shop, near the back, aquariums with fish floating belly-up. If this is my last review on Yelp... the oysters got me.

Crowded, with inattentive staff, an unusually long wait for a table, and the whole place seemed vaguely unsanitary. Many, many items were gone, empty plates sitting for an unacceptable amount of time. Maybe someone else got all the good food right before my trips back up to the buffet. I&#39;ve been to many sushi places, more than a few buffets, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had such an unfavorable good items to bad items ratio.  Unfortunate, as this is quite near my home, so I was excited to try it. Never again."

If you need help just go to the back dining area and you&#39;ll find plenty of servers gathered together laughing and texting while customer drink glasses remain empty. But if you leave a poor tip which they deserve at the very most, some will confront you about it. Oh, like that&#39;s really going to scare us hard core locals. Food is very poor quality and soaked in oil. Beef dishes are like chewing on brown rubber. Sliced tuna for sushi often has brown ends. Took a bite of a steamed fish and spit it out because it was almost cold and raw. No wonder a recent guest called the health department. We loved this place so much when they opened but now it is just another greasy Asian buffet. Forget the huge variety bit as that is meaningless if the food is no good. It&#39;s a never ending restaurant industry story: A restaurant starts out great and slowly degrades to poor service and bad food to lower it&#39;s costs. It&#39;s all about the money. Nothing else matters."

They do have a wide selection of sushi rolls and sashimi that they put out sparingly and in small amounts, which isn&#39;t always fresh. They have a lot of hot food too, including dim sum, make-it-yourself habachi grill, and typical Chinese and American foods. I like the cooked fish dishes and the moose track ice cream. They have a good desert selection that includes cotton candy, chocolate fondue, various ice creams, crepes, and your usual buffet deserts. 

We usually go for lunch since it is cheaper, but we recently went for the first time for dinner and I didn&#39;t see much of a difference. The only items that I noticed on the dinner buffet that weren&#39;t available for lunch were salty crab legs (you know the long red ones you need to crack), more sashimi that wasn&#39;t fresh, and raw oysters that I did particularly enjoy. There weren&#39;t as much cooked fish for dinner, but I am not sure if it was just because they were out. So I don&#39;t think that the dinner was worth paying more for. 

All in all, this is still the best Chinese buffet in the area, especially for sushi since Todai closed in Woodfield Mall.

Some seating at the bar and raised platform areas are not accessible, but everything else is manageable. Some tables and booths are hard to get to, but they have been good about finding a table that will work with my wheelchair. I haven&#39;t had a negative experience with the staff yet. They have a wheelchair accessible stall with grab bars that is usually clean in the women&#39;s restroom, so I assume that there is an accessible stall in the men&#39;s as well. There are quite a few accessible parking spaces, but they are often occupied. We still manage to get an accessible parking space. There are two sets of doors to get in and no automatic door opener."

Their sushi is good (as far as buffets go), they have lots of fried seafood and meat, and you probably won&#39;t be able to get through everything before you get full. They have a great dessert selection, with tiramisu, flan, cake, a chocolate fondue fountain, and ice cream that includes green tea and red bean flavors.

I walk in and was and kindly greeted by the host and seated. My love and I immediately dived into the food. I was so excited. I went for all of my favorite dishes!  .... all to be let down. 

The crab legs had a funny, moldy after taste... 
The sushi was okay, but flavorless.. 
The fried rice had to flavor as well. :/ 
The dim sum was sub par if that... I&#39;d rather go to China town for it. 

The green tea icecream was the most disappointing. I thought it was weird that I saw streaks of vanilla in it... it wasn&#39;t green tea icecream! It simply food coloring. No sweetnes, no flavor, no green tea. :( wtf?

Positives:

-Inexpensive 
-It was very crowded (I thought this would be a good sign)
....that&#39;s it 

Negatives:

-The terrible smell of sewage when walking in
-The smell even saturated to where the food was
-The plates were at floor level (doesn&#39;t seem like a good place for plates to be)
-Flies were at an abundance 
-Some of the food had mold on it (mainly the grapes that were out)
-People were very rude 
-Was very concerned with how fresh the food was 
-Ate a small amount of noodles and veggies and became ill later that night 

All in all, I would NOT NEVER recommend this place to anyone. I really feel the need to call the Health Department on this place. I was shocked that it was crowded and people actually thought it was good. I wouldn&#39;t eat here if it was the last restaurant on earth.

We would wait 5-10 minutes in line just to get 1/2 a lobster and 1/2 a steamed crab. The people dining there are just as rude, I had a lady stand in line in front of me, and as we got closer, her husband, her 2 adult daughters, and adult son cut in front of her.

Put a few selections on your plate, head back to your table, and it&#39;s just barely warm. 

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s not at the temperature it should be per food safety standards. The FDA states 140 degrees or warmer is the requirement for keeping bacteria from forming and proliferating, so it&#39;s not surprising that several other reviewers have complained of food poisoning.

I particularly like the Mongolian noodle station -- you can choose your type(s) of meat, veggies, and type of noodle....pick out your sauces and take it over to the guy going around the giant round flat griddle. Because of the intense heat of the griddle, the food is cooked in a matter of minutes! The result is a steaming hot plate of your favorite ingredients + noodles to enjoy back at your table.

For dinner, you can get in a very long line for lobster tail and crab legs. If there are a lot of people, they are known to limit the amount you get. For instance, there was this time where they only allowed for half a lobster tail and one set of crab legs. All the other times, tho, they let you have a whole set for both.

Weekends,  holidays, lobster night are pretty crowded.  There is a parking lot, but always hard to find parking.  You will be waiting up to 30 to 45 mins just to be seated.  Then when you get seated, theres another long line (30 to 1 hour) for lobster or crab.  They have lots of food.  Chinese, dim sum, sushi, hibachi grill, desserts, cotton candy, etc. 

All the food is good in taste and flavor.  The dim sum,  are not the best. Either too dry or been out too long.  Sushis are simple and appeared to be made daily and fresh.  

Over all, I can see the staff tries hard to accommodate everyone.  It is overcrowded.  There has been times, where we ask for water, or extra napkins, or silverware. (Crab crackers) 30 minutes later, the same waiter still standing there talking with another, or just completely forgot your request.  You may have to ask more then once.

Went here once, while I was 8 months pregnant.  Waited in the crab line for 45 minutes.  The line was very long, with many hungry people patiently waiting. When I finally got to the front, the lady only handed out 1 half crab claws to each person. I asked kindly, to make an exception.   Cus i couldn&#39;t stand in another 45 minutes line with a huge baby belly with sore feet,  for another half crab.  She gave me another half, and I appreciated and remembered this moment.

I enjoyed all the food here.  Would I go again?  yes. Depending on my group size, how desperate I am, and if I want to wait for buffet food.  Plenty of seafood here, But I can go anywhere else for crab and lobster, pay the same fees and not have to wait for an eternal just to get it."

Their advertised 9:30pm closing time is not true.

I arrived as a party of three for dinner at 8:00pm. We didn&#39;t get seated until 8:13pm and I have the receipt with the time stamp to prove it. We go up to get food and most of the dishes were either close to empty or very old and dried out. I give the benefit of the doubt and grab a few things thinking we probably came towards the end of a cycle and they&#39;ll probably be refilling everything one last time considering the restaurant closes at 9:30pm according to the sign on their restaurant and what&#39;s listed here. We still have more than an hour and the food should be cycled one more time right? Boy was I fooled. 

At around 8:25pm I asked the cooks if there&#39;s going to be anymore lobster. They would just look at me and roll their eyes and walk away. So, at this point I don&#39;t know if more will be coming out our not still. Fair enough they&#39;re probably busy, so I plan on coming back after I get some sushi. The sushi was incredibly old and stale and more than half of the plates were empty. The sushi men had already cleaned their stations and were playing on their phones. I come back to the lobster section and ask one more time and they finally give me an answer of &#34;no&#34;. It&#39;s not even 8:30 and half the restaurant seems to be off limits already while the other half is just inedible. I asked the busboy that has been serving our table what time they close and he tells me they close at 9:30 but the kitchen closes at 9:00. I expressed with him that I&#39;m a bit frustrated if that&#39;s what they&#39;re advertising why is it that half the restaurant is shut down already and why they made the decision of seating us at 8:13 if they weren&#39;t planning on serving us at that time. He calmly tells me he doesn&#39;t have an answer for me which I completely understand and ask him politely if I&#39;m able to speak to someone that does. He suggests I talk to the manager and I ask him if I should go to him or if he&#39;d come to me. He tells me that he&#39;ll bring the manager.

Five minutes later Qinqin comes with a check and comes up to me and tells me she took 10% off the bill and asks if that&#39;s okay. At this point, I&#39;m getting a little upset because they made the assumption that I&#39;m asking for a manager just to get something for free. I told her that I just wanted to ask her a few questions and she responds with a sigh and eye roll. I continued with my question regardless of her body language and asked her what time they close. She tells me the kitchen closes at 8:30 and they close at 9:00. I told her that time frame doesn&#39;t match with what&#39;s advertised and what another employee has told me. She sighs again and says, &#34;so what do you want then?&#34; I&#39;m completely appalled by her response and simply told her I don&#39;t understand how she had the confidence to seat us without notifying us that the kitchen was closing fifteen minutes after she seated us. I&#39;m okay with kitchens closing early in restaurants as it is a business and if it&#39;s slow you have to make those type of calls. What upsets me is that a restaurant doesn&#39;t have an issue notifying their customers before seating and charging them. She begins to walk away during mid conversation and I ask her where she is going and she tells me she&#39;s going to get the manager with another eye roll. This whole time I thought she was the manager, but she&#39;s a server the manager sent instead.

Sorry, I didn&#39;t get a chance to get the manager&#39;s name. As soon as I get to him the first thing he says to me is, &#34;I gave you 10% off is that not enough?&#34; I basically repeat everything I told Qinqin to him and he begins to pass the blame instead of owning up. When a manager begins to blame their staff this is a huge red flag for a business. He tells me whichever employee told me they close at 9:30 is wrong and tells me the server should&#39;ve notified me the kitchen was closing and should&#39;ve showed me the food available and if I&#39;d still be interested in dining with them tonight. He then begins to tell me because we stopped serving lobster early he gave me 10% off. He seems to think this is all because I didn&#39;t get lobster. Personally, I&#39;m not the biggest fan of lobster and I keep trying to explain to him this has nothing to do with that. He responds with, &#34;what do you want then?&#34; I told him I&#39;m not trying to get free stuff I&#39;m just trying to give him feedback and trying to get an understanding on why no one&#39;s closing times match up and asked if the he truly believes I received fair service and food for the amount we paid. He then asks me, &#34;How much do you want to pay then?&#34; At this point I&#39;m getting upset that he&#39;s making this all about money, so I finally just tell him to charge me whatever he thinks is fair and we pay and leave."

After reading all of these wonderful reviews, I just can&#39;t get over how not amazing this place was. I was super excited at first, you all had me completely fooled. I even broke my &#34;Never again will I eat at a buffet&#34; vow that I made at the Epic Buffet at the Hollywood Casino. So, incredibly, disappointed. 

At $25.00 a person, the food was so not worth the price. I&#39;m pretty sure I ate about $25 dollars worth of food, but the food was not good. I stuck with mainly sushi; the selection was pretty impressive when I walked up, however, when I went to go eat it, the rolls fell apart, they were luke warm, and flavorless. The crab rangoon was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. It tasted like straight mayo inside of a crunchy shell. The only two things that I could really stomach were the miso soup and the lomein. 

I really should have done the create your own Mongolian bowl, because at least then you would see the chefs making it in front of you. 

The service was mediocre at best, I picked up multiple plates that were still crusted with food on them. We had to ask for new forks and spoons twice because they were crusted with food, and the waiter was slow to pick up our plates. 

I really wish we had been here during the lunch time price Monday through Friday which is only $12 because I nearly cried when I saw the bill. 

It literally took me all night to digest and have an appetite for more food. The food didn&#39;t sit well at all. 

So, I&#39;m back to my vow...I will never go to another buffet again."

My lobster was cooked to much and was 90% mustard.  Sushi was slimy.  Didn&#39;t eat any of that stuff, only the stuff that didn&#39;t look improperly prepared, but it didn&#39;t work.  I got sick.

The selections consist of a good variety in meats, vegetables and seafood. They had snow crab legs which is a plus, the only thing about them is that they are very salty but have a good amount of meat on them. Rumor has it that lobster nights are Wednesdays and Fridays so I will be returning. The sushi is good but I have to understand that it has been sitting out for hours so the rice tends to be dry and hard. The DIM SUM is not good, I had a bite and tossed the rest. I didn&#39;t get a chance to try the hibachi grill but it did look appealing. Fruits and ice cream selection was mediocre, nothing special. Service was great, they kept asking if we need refills on our drinks and picked up dirty plates when need to be. I would give this buffet 3 stars but an extra star for great service! Thank you!

They have unlimited lobster on Wednesdays and Fridays? Also, their bathroom was absolutely freezing. It felt like I stepped outside without my coat. Don&#39;t get their green tea ice cream. Not that great. But they do have a crepe station.

In the grand scheme of all things, this place isn&#39;t too bad for a buffet restaurant. You have a stir fry section, sushi, seafood, dessert with a cotton candy, crepe, ice cream and chocolate fountain. Pretty darn awesome. Just don&#39;t expect Michelin star food."

My top pics are - lobster (everyone in my group loved it), fried fish with the house sauce, chicken wings, steamed oyster.

The variety is phenomenal. They had Japanese food, Korean, and Chinese food. Their sushi is decent and for $12, you cannot beat that. They also have a hibachi, so you can select your ingredients and they will throw it on the grill for you. Their dessert selection is not your typical buffet selection. It is also huge. The one thing I did not like were their oysters. They were really tough. It&#39;s a buffet in the middle of the Midwest, I couldn&#39;t really expect much with that, but hey! I thought I would give it a try.

Because I had such a good experience there, I took my parents and my brother. We came at noon on a weekend, so the price wasn&#39;t $12 anymore. It was about $25 per person.

The entrance is a little weird as you walk in there&#39;s a huge &#34;pond&#34; and further inside you have the hostess stand and a counter to the side.

It&#39;s a little vegasy/night club with the blue lighting, but if they put you in the big dining area in the back, it&#39;s not as bad. 

What I like most is the variety. They have a Mongolian stir fry (where you can make your own bowls), sushi, dim sum, and variety of hot dishes. It&#39;s quite amazing the selection that they offer so you are sure to try something that you&#39;ve never had before.

We arrived at about 12:30 pm on Saturday. The place was full, with no line to get in, but people seemed polite and I didn&#39;t notice any cutting in line or rudeness.

The seafood did not disappoint. I started with a whole dungeness crab which I&#39;d never had before. It was toasty warm, despite the fact that it was from a buffet. My first act was to accidentally explode a crab claw all over myself and the table, but after that things went better. There were several types of broiled fish, steamed clams, oysters and scallops cooked in shell. I was particularly fond of the steamed scallops dressed with sesame oil, soy sauce and scallions. There were lobsters, snow crab legs, steamed crayfish and battered crab legs (in shell) and many kinds of shrimp. The snow crab legs were nicely steamed. There was also a fresh raw shellfish bar, but given the review of Spaghetti O and my own disinclination toward raw oysters, I decided to skip the raw shellfish offerings. 

Since I was mostly here to try abalone for the first time, I didn&#39;t eat much of the other Chinese food. However, I did try the roast duck (excellent), beef spare ribs, steamed green beans and of course the tender abalone, which was perfectly cooked with bamboo shoots and shitake mushrooms. YUM! There were so many other  dishes I wanted to try, but just didn&#39;t have the tummy space, yanno?

(I noticed there were several types of unusual food like a variety of chicken feet and some pig trotters, but those aren&#39;t really my thing, so I left them to the folks who are into them.)

Then I went on to the sushi offerings. The selection was pretty impressive. As others have noted, since it is sitting out on a buffet platter, it can be a bit dry, but I was happy with the tako, mackerel, red snapper, unagi, spicy crab and wasabi fish roe sushi. They also had little portion cups of  flying fish roe, tako su and spicy whole baby octopi, among other items. There were whole bottles of the appropriate toppings if you wanted to add more spicy mayo  to your sushi rolls, etc.

After that I had some lovely dim sum. There was lotus rice, bean paste dumplings steamed in bamboo leaves, pork buns, coconut buns, shrimp dumplings, shrimp fun rolls and many types of shumai. There was also a lovely desert-like gelatinous dumpling filled with coconut paste that I really liked.  

Finally I finished up with desert, some lovely bananas and wafers dipped into the chocolate fondue fountain, over some green tea ice cream. I&#39;d call the quality of the ice cream middle of the road, but I enjoyed it. Sadly I just didn&#39;t have room for the desert crepes or cotton candy! 

I also regret missing out on trying the Mongolian grill, but as it was I was about as full as I could comfortably enjoy. 

Everything I tried was well-flavored and good quality, considering it was on buffet tables. The staff was helpful, being sure to hand me a crab-cracker for my seafood, without me even asking! We will definitely be back for more!"

This place is huge! There&#39;s doors to backrooms and backrooms into backrooms, yep that&#39;s how big this place is.

We came here on a Wednesday evening with a party of 30+ and they easily accommodated us. Like any other buffet you usually figure out where your table is and head on over to all the deliciousness. There was always a crab/lobster line the whole night, but it moved steadily. The seafood was fresh and juicy. 

Their variety of hot food is vast! So much to choose from that sometimes I find myself with 2 plates in my hands (don&#39;t judge). Most of it is seafood, but they do have some meat/beef options. Their sushi is actually pretty good for a buffet, which is saying something, since my favorite spots are usually those on the spots fresh made sushi not no container from Jewel or Dominick&#39;s, yuck.

The service was eh, usually you&#39;ll have to wave someone down for more water or napkins, etc. But we really enjoyed the food and we&#39;ll be back!

We three of my friends went to Royal Buffet in Hoffman area on Monday evening around 7:30. It&#39;s not so busy but there were some customers. What we saw were 70% almost empty plates on the buffet coolers and lots of kitchen employees were just playing with their smart phones instead of refilling the dishes. It&#39;s still around 7:30pm hallo!? New customers still were coming in and pay for those empty dishes?! 

All the foods on the rest of the 30% plates were dried, not fresh and over sauced foods. 

We ended up with paying over $85 for the unsatisfactory buffet experiences and suffer with diarrhea. 

There are many other buffet restaurants serve better for more reasonable price. I will never go again."

I just had 2 Shrimp Spring Rolls... So much flavor and so healthy!  My go to snack when I get hungry at work.  

I also, had the Chicken Pad Thai Lunch, which the girl kept saying &#34;small portion&#34;, and it was anything but that.  Super flavorful, tasty and filling!  I am making this my go to comfort food &amp; Thai place :)"

We call the restaurant and we give our order it took a few min that was fine english wasnt the person first language we made a order for delivery we ordered the duck soup and chive dumpling and extra noodle we wait 40 min to get our delivery and our house is 10 blocks from the restaurant 
The delivery guy came and he called the restaurant cause they forgot to write down how much it costs and it took a while for the delivery guy to get the amount from the person at the restaurant i pay the guy 28.00 for my order and i go inside and unpack my order and i find that they forgot the extra noodle and the duck soup contaior size has gotten smaller and our chive dumplings were only cooked on one side, the only saving grace was the duck soup was good the broth was good perfectly balanced not the water down broth we got the last time we order the duck soup"

We were really surprised that Dan Thai has really great Thai food. We ordered Shrimp Pad Thai and Beef Thai Fried Rice. Both entrees were delicious and had tasty flavor! And the portions were good for 2 people. The beef was very juicy (cooked medium well) and shrimps in the noodles were huge. Their service was also on point, which made my review a five star. 

Well done Dan Thai! We will absolutely be returning to your restaurant!"

The panang curry was light with a great flavor and really tender pieces of beef. The basil fish had a nice kick to it and the fish was cooked really well. The two dishes actually went really well together because the spiciness of the fish was offset by the coconut milk in the curry sauce. 

The service was true Thai style where our server was really friendly and checked on us to make sure our waters were always refilled. I would recommend this place for a casual lunch or dinner with co-workers or friends."

They have really good lunch deals (about $8 for a meal, which includes a list of a variety of Thai dishes). We both had the tea, and agreed that it was really good, almost tasted like coffee. We also shared an order of the spring rolls. I wish they came with peanut sauce, but it came with a different sauce instead. They were still good. We both ordered the panang curry, and it was delicious! I could eat that every day. It wasn&#39;t spicy at all, so if you like spicy you may have to specify that. It was the perfect portion for lunch and the price.

The service was great, she was fast, the food came out quickly, no complaints."

I ordered duck basil fried rice and red Thai curry chicken. Both dishes were fire ! For appetizer, I had the crab wheel-- more like fish wheel. It was so fishy, not just the smell but also the taste. 

Basil duck fried rice: had a great mix of veggies (green beans, red pepper, carrots, onions, green onions, peas and of course lots of basil). Perfect taste and not overpowered with curry. Highly recommended. Next time, I&#39;ll probably try chicken or shrimp basil fried rice. 

Red Thai curry: be careful how you order. I&#39;m usually not a wuss when it comes to spice. I ordered medium spice and man, I&#39;m sweating balls. It was hot as hell. Unless they made a mistake their medium is like habanero hot. This dish is great! I ordered extra chicken on this dish because it never comes with enough chicken. For $2 more, you get double the chicken to satisfy your chicken head desire!"

You get a decent amount for the cost. My appetite would definitely appreciate a few bites more haha! However the appetizers were pretty underwhelming. The crab ragoon had such little filling in it! Plenty of fried dough though. The spring rolls were neat until that monstrous sized basil leaf (?) got mixed all up in there. It was just too overpowering. So I&#39;d go back for the entrees, but I would be hesitant to try anything else from there."

Pad See Ew was really  fresh with great veggies.  Chicken pad thai medium heat is perfect! Not too spicy just right.  Sesame Chicken was the surprising winner.  So delicious! Thai fried rice was nice and light but not as sweet as most places.  Overall we had many selections Ave only disappointed with the sweet and sour stir fry.

I am not a fussy eater at all. We ordered delivery. It arrived sooner than promised, so that was good. The food was so greasy, we had to throw a few things out right away.  The rest was just horrible. it was flavorless. I don&#39;t know how Jasmine rice can be flavorless. The chicken was tough and greasy. The grease tasted very old. I have never had greasy oriental food. We checked Yelp before ordering, and thought the reviews were good. We either had a bad night, or everyone else caught them on a good night. For 40.00 which included only one entrée we will not be back."

The sounds of water trickling softly combined with the score from Kung Fu Panda almost wants to make you meditate. In fact, the ambiance forced me to sit with perfect posture and bring out my calm polite voice. 

The food. From start to finish this is the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to. Ever. I was kind of mad that I have been wasting my time at Thai Thanee and Thai Garden all these years. But then the anger was quickly swept away by the zen version of a boys to men song. Can&#39;t get mad here. 

The fried tofu: perfect with the sweet peanut sauce. Crunchy on the outside and airy on the inside. $4 for a portion to feed 3 people easily. 

The tom yum soup (tofu): we ordered it medium. Our mistake. You are not to blame Dan Thai. It was very good but the spice took away from the lemon grass. Next time we will not mess with it and get it as is. Lesson learned. $4 for a small which 2 of us couldn&#39;t finish. 

The larb: never had it before but I should have. Ground chicken tossed in lemon or lime with onions. A lot of food here. A lot of chicken. Wasn&#39;t sure what to do with the lettuce on the side so I rolled up some larb on there. Amazing. $8 for a plate which can feed 4 people easily. 

The sesame chicken: Yes. This is a dish that can easily go the wrong way but not here. Crunchy. Crunchy like Korean chicken wings. Sweet. Ordered it medium. Next time I will get hot. This was the best sesame chicken I have ever had in my life. And my ass has gone to a lot of $5 lunch special spots in my life. This is the real deal. Leaves a slight tacky feeling to your teeth for a few seconds and melts away cleanly. $9 for one dish which could have served 4 people. 

There isn&#39;t a single bad thing I can say about this place. I am a fairly negative nancy usually but I feel great leaving here. I think I will just lay here and smile for a while. Have a beautiful day. 


***UPDATE***  the zen mood does not apply to lunch pick up. However, they did not disappoint. Although the lunch specials were lacking in quantity and cost, they made up for it in quality. I have to keep reminding myself that&#39;s it is Thai, not Chinese take-Out."

For starters had the egg rolls and wontons.

I love the ambience and the decor. Went on a Week night and it has a decent crowd. 
The staff were very very courteous and prompt.

dan-thai-schaumburg,Jessica H.,TYyh60inSQExNyycqiDGqw,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,1,27,6,Akkl_kMcQePGeZvPKx2zCw,1.0,2015-11-04,"So here&#39;s the deal about Dan Thai: the food is good. It&#39;s the only Thai food that my husband has ever liked. Granted, he&#39;s picky about Thai food and hasn&#39;t tried it as often as I have but he&#39;s a huge fan of their wings and their pad thai. So that&#39;s the good part. We&#39;ve been ordering take out from them several times a month for the past six months. But that stops starting right now. 

Not only have they left things out of our orders more often than not,  they provided some of the worst customer service that I have recently experienced. 

Tonight we placed an order for myself,  my husband, and my BFF. We got the chicken wings and chicken pad thai,  tofu pad thai and basil tofu with a side of sticky rice. I picked it up around 8:30 and the lady checking me out was friendly and polite. Because we had so much food,  I just asked if everything was in there including the sticky rice and she said yes.  I tipped her,  she thanked me,  we both moved on with our lives. 

Until I got home and my husband got upset that there was no sauce with the wings. That&#39;s the reason why he orders wings.  Then he tells me they only gave him six wings. This is the first time I&#39;ve called them to let them know and I started off nice,  I really did. 

Then the gentleman tells me that he goes by weight,  not count. I say that this isn&#39;t what his website says and he replies that it is outdated. I say that&#39;s not how it&#39;s advertised and also advise that we didn&#39;t have the chili sauce.  He tells me to check the bag and that&#39;s when I said that that was the point,  there was no sauce anywhere. He then actually said to me &#34;Well if you really want to drive back over here for one chicken wing you can.&#34; I told him that at this point I want my money back and he tells me to bring back the wings and then he would refund the money. 

That&#39;s right. Not once did I get an apology.  Not once was he empathetic. Nope,  he gave excuses and did nothing to attempt to help me,  instead became defensive,  petty,  an offensive enough to make me want to drive back to the restaurant. 

My husband witnessed this and decided to go himself. He gets there and the guy has money on the counter and says,  &#34;here,  your money back plus tax.&#34;  My husband explains that he doesn&#39;t appreciate the false advertising or having to drive back to the restaurant to return chicken wings because our order was messed up again.  He tells the man that we order so often and he&#39;s started checking the order before he leaves because it&#39;s wrong fairly often. My husband,  a much more patient and kinder person than I complimented him on his food and said that he was really disappointed with this experience. All the guy says is that he knows his food is good and that his prices are cheaper than others. Again,  more excuses. My husband left with no chicken wings and a refund of only the cost for the dish that we returned. 

That&#39;s OK. I never thought that Dan Thai was cheap,  it was just good. But not good enough for me to put myself in a chicken wings situation again. I don&#39;t expect anyone to kiss my butt but I do expect at the very least,  someone to own up to a less than stellar experience. 

You may find decent food at Dan Thai but I hope that you never have a problem. If you do,  you might have to deal with someone who has no desire to help you, every intention of being petty and difficult. Don&#39;t let Dan Thai ruin your next meal."

My husband and daughter went to look at the fish and our same waitress asked how any people in their party....the place was very empty like 5 booth were occupied....how she did not notice she was our waitress I have no idea. The food was good. It had a good flavor but my dish was a noodle dish and it barely had any noodles.

With decent reviews and close to where I was at, my sister and I decided to give this place a try.

We were surprised to find there were lots of people in this small restaurant. The interior was dimly lit. We were offered a table by the window and received our menu and water. We ordered our food, and that&#39;s when things went a little downhill from there. 

We waited, and waited, and waited even more. We probably waited around 40 minutes to get our pad thai and a spicy shrimp dish (which I forgot the name). We had ordered Thai iced teas that came out fairly earlier, and I swear, we were nearly through with our drinks and the food still had not come out. We were almost on the verge of just paying for the drinks and leaving because the wait felt unacceptable. We noticed that other tables were experiencing long waits as well. The magic equation is: foodless tables + hungry people + long waits = unhappy people. That&#39;s exactly what applied to us.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the servers and staff were fairly nice and apologized for the long wait. We were glad that we hadn&#39;t come with a larger group because who knows how long THAT would have taken.

The food was fine and affordable. The pad thai was our favorite and we actually ordered this dish for take-out on another day. Ordering take-out was a fairly smooth process."

I typically rotate between Beef Pad See Ewe, Chicken/Beef pad thai, and the panang curry. Their pineapple fried rice is really good too. This place is nearly as good as the awesome spots I find in the city... and I&#39;m so particular with the choice of beef that asian restaurants use. These guys use some hearty and flavorful beef; not the generic chewy grainy stuff that is all too easy to find elsewhere. They even have sticky rice with mango that is soooo delish!

Always spot on for flavor.  

My only few things: 
When they do delivery, they don&#39;t include utensils.
Their thai iced tea is a lot smaller than I&#39;d like it to be for the price."

I ordered beef pad see eww and it smelled horrible .   The chicken satay was good but the pad see eew was horrible!  I had the chef smell it and they told me they use fish sauce to cook it which was not true.   I know what fish sauce taste like and that was defiantly not fish sauce.  I was still charged for the dish.  Incredible place.

Thanks Yelp! My boyfriend loves Thai food now -- possibly more than Chinese (not an easy task).
We all shared the chicken satay, tom yum soup, sesame chicken, pad thai, pad see ew, and then finished dinner off with the mango and sticky rice dessert. My boyfriend especially liked the sesame chicken. The only thing I noticed that was off was the duck -- it was a little bland.
Service was attentive and nice, and the meal, apart from the duck, was delicious."

I was lucky enough to get to try just about everything- each dish was well prepared, flavorful, fresh and yum-tacular! Most served with rice and spiced to order.
Portions were large, and our waitress worked with us to make sure we had enough appetizers for all to enjoy.

Water, beverages and plates were all well maintained by staff and they even helped us cut and share a homemade cake!
At the end, the waitress offered to split the check. She didn&#39;t ask- she offered! Great service, great food and it made for a wonderful overall experience.

Pricing was reasonable, small location, but intimate with a nice ambiance and private parking area."

The reason I give this place a 4 star rating is because the food is exceptional. The service, however was mediocre at best. The other issues had was that the two entrées my wife and I ordered (pad Thai chicken and veggie stir fry) took over 40 minutes to get to our table. I counted, and there were only 6 tables occupied (not including ours) most of which only had 2 or 3 people at them.

Right when we walked in we where greeted and sat. The waitress was very sweet and very attentive to us. 

I was very excited when we got the menus because they had a ton of options for you. To start my order I got the Tofu Tom Yum soup and hands down the best Tom Yum soup I&#39;ve ever had. They ask you how hot you want your food and since I love spicy I got the extra spicy. The flavor in the soup is amazing and they are not afraid to spice it up for you like some places. When they say spicy they  mean it. For dinner I had the Seafood Drunken Noodles, again extra spicy. I am very picky about seafood at certain places but the seafood in this dish was delicious. It tasted fresh and was just so good. The noodles where cooked perfectly and the spice and flavor again where just perfect. 

I highly recommend this place to Thai food lovers and spicy food lovers. I suggest getting the medium spice if you are not sure about to spicy. I already want to go back and try new things. The waitress always made sure we had beverages and came back to check on us. Pricing is very fair, for the 4 of us including two appetizers the total was about $60.00."

Then each of us had something different, one person had the red curry with crispy noodles, the curry was really good in my opinion, one another person had the drunken noodles with tofu, that was also good. I had the pad thai with chicken, it was really good. I really liked the entrees.

Then we had the Taro custard, which was pudding but it tasted like sweet egg with coconut, too eggy taste for some reason and had the banana in the blanket with lychee ice cream, that was good. I particularly enjoyed the banana in the blanket which is nothing but a piece of banana wrapped with crispy outer shell of flour I guess.

Here&#39;s a list why: Waitress *older lady had a attitude problem, they ran out of certain food upon ordering (keep in mind its only  7pm). For the amount of time it took for the food to get out to us there was no WOW factor at all upon tasting. Keep in mind we ordered a variety of entrees and appetizers. The only thing that stood out was Thai ice tea drink and basil chicken that&#39;s about it. It looked like they were totally understaffed that night, regardless I wont be coming back.

We came here with a group of 8 on a Sunday night at around 7 pm and they maybe had 1-2 other tables.  We were quickly seated and given water but that is where the good service ended.  

We ordered some shumai dumplings, Panang Curry and Red Curry.  We waited, and waited and waited and then got our appetizers.  The dumplings were fantastic, especially the sauce that was served with them.  It was another wait for the food and then our dishes kind of staggered out, each one coming a couple of minutes after the other one. The food was pretty amazing.  I loved everything about my curry and it was a pretty large portion.  I will say that one of the people I was dining with was dissapointed because the restaurant will not allow you to substitute fried rice for steamed rice with your entree.  So if you want fried rice, you have to get a whole order which is pretty large.  The good news is that the fried rice is the best I have ever tasted.  

To get the check was probably the longest wait of all of the waiting we had done during our quick dinner.  Had the service been better this place could easily be a 5."

The fish cakes were as the app were not very good. They were a little chewy and didn&#39;t seem freshly made. However the panang had great deep flavor and the spicy catsfish was also delicious enough to stand up to it. It&#39;s hard to top the deliciousness of panang. I would say both dishes probably could&#39;ve used a bit more salt to really knock those dishes socks off. Buy service was friendly, prompt, and dinner was very affordable.

Our waitress didn&#39;t show up for another 10 minutes to take our order. We started with appetizer platter followed by seafood plate and chicken pad seew. I was not impressed with food quality and size. Crab ragoons were way too hard instead of crispy and egg rolls were nothing special. Seafood platter had 3 shrimps total (yes, we counted). Pad seew was ok but noodles were a bit over cooked. Plate sizes were small so be prepared to order appetizers before hand as the main dish will not fill you if you are hungry.

We waited 10 minutes before anyone would seat us. An older couple in their 60s walked in dressed up and they were totally taken care of where my wife an I were ignored. They walked in about the 10 minute mark when we were waiting and someone went up to them immediately when they walked in and wanted to seat them. The older couple had to say to them I think they (we) were here first, so they seated us.

The older couple sat in the booth next to us and they were totally attended to. They got their water and drinks right away, their order was taken quickly, and they were done with their meal within 30 minutes. On the other hand, we waited 10 minutes for menus and to take our drink orders. Another 10 minutes for our order to be taken and by the time we were done with our meal (which was the same amount as the older couple - drinks, one appetizer, and two entrees) it has been one hour 15 minutes. Why did they give the older couple more attention, very friendly, and cater to their needs in comparison to them being unfriendly, non-attentive, and slow with my wife and I?

Like I said the food is very good, but the service is bad and we didn&#39;t have the best experience. I would go back, but maybe we should dress up so that they will give us more attention."

Sticky rice- fell apart - don&#39;t recommend if u like eating by hand. Jasmine rice is overcooked for my liking - mushy. Basil lover dish (medium)- it&#39;s descent.l, but a tinge salty.

It was about 2:00 PM and the plaza that it&#39;s in was completely dead.  Walked in to find one other table eating.  As soon as we sat down we all ordered our Thai Iced Tea/Coffee which is always delicious.  Appetizer round of Crab Rangoons followed of course!  They were yummy as well.. Now these things are hard to mess up so i&#39;m still waiting for judgment time.  Now any Thai joint I go to, I need to try their versions of my favorite Thai dish which is the spicy catfish.  As my plate came out, it looked promising.  It was a good sized portion and accompanied by a bowl of white rice.  Yes!  Thank you Dan Thai for meeting my expectations.  While not as good as some, definitely worth it for me as it hit the spot.  Would&#39;ve liked it to be a little more saucy for it was just a smidge dry for my taste but great nonetheless.

Everyone else I was with seemed pleased as well.  If we are around the area this will definitely be an option for myself again.  

The decor, like any smaller That restaurant around.  Home like feel with some sort of marine life.  They surprisingly had a small but neat looking salt water aquarium!  I love salt water fish mainly because I have no time to take care of them but the colors, vewy pwetty!

In college, some friends introduced me to Pad Thai and Pad Seeyou. I fell in love instantly! I then considered myself a Thai expert just because I&#39;ve had those 2 noodle dishes with each of the 4 meats (beef, chicken, pork, and shrimp). Then one day, on a business trip, I tried Pok Pok in Portland and had the Boar Collar dish they have and instantly realized, I knew jack about Thai! So one day, a buddy and I were wondering what to eat, and I suggested Thai, and Dan Thai just happened to be the place closest to us!

The place is in the middle of a strip mall. The location of the strip mall is fairly premium, it&#39;s near a big intersection, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever come into this strip mall my entire life, and I live less than 3 miles from it! The inside is pretty standard to most Thai places I&#39;ve been to. It has a fairly decent number of tables, and it&#39;s usually been quiet when I&#39;ve gone, which is either later at night or late lunch on the weekends.

SPRING ROLLS &amp; CRAB WHEEL
Well the fresh spring rolls are like everybody&#39;s fresh spring rolls. Nothing unique about these. The Crab Wheels are supposed to be crab in &#34;garlic pepper seasoning fried and served with sweet chili sauce,&#34; but that&#39;s not what I tasted. It just tasted like 1/3 of an imitation crab roll, breaded and fried. Taste was kinda funky by itself. The sauce was really good and helped, but wasn&#39;t anything I&#39;d order again.

TOM YUM/KHA
I order my Tom Khas and Tom Yums extra spicy. I&#39;ve had both of these and they are both excellent. Perfect ratio of mushrooms and meat. I consider ginger to be a landmine in Thai soups, but although they are present, I didn&#39;t have to be as careful as I had to be in other places. I don&#39;t know what it is that I&#39;ve had at other places, but they have this skin of some vegetable (looks like a green onion) but it feels like a plastic straw that I can&#39;t chew. They didn&#39;t have that either, so I could peacefully drink my soup.

PENANG CURRY
With Dan Thai being a random restaurant in a strip mall in Schaumburg, I was expecting that whatever I have here, there&#39;ll be tons of other Thai places that are much better. If that is the case, I&#39;m still waiting for a better Penang Curry! LIke the soups, there aren&#39;t a lot of &#34;land mines&#34; that I&#39;ve had at other places. The curry isn&#39;t watery like some either, but the consistency is just perfect, like a Cream of Mushroom soup. It&#39;s got a perfect peanutty flavor and the heat is also nicely done (even though I&#39;d like a little hotter when I order &#34;extra spicy&#34;). It&#39;s a giant bowl too, so be careful if you order with other things. I was stuffed with the appetizer and other entree we got, but the curry was so good, I ended up cleaning out the bowl, and then wanted to die because I was so full.

BOTTOM LINE
There was one restaurant out in Wilmette (I think) that had an better Tom Kha, but their Penang was just ok. I think, so far, if I ever had a craving for Thai, I&#39;m going to Dan Thai for the whole package. Almost perfect Tom Yum/Kha and the best Penang Curry I&#39;ve ever had. I really want to see if there even is such a thing as a better Penang Curry than Dan Thai. I&#39;m going to go revisit my old college Thai place and see if they can hang..."

The service was friendly and overall very polite and courteous.  The place was clean with some Thai and cultural decor giving it an authentic feel.  

Lunch specials ends at 2:30pm and they have a separate menu for that.  Though the lunch special menu only have Pad Thai as their noodle selection and the rest are mostly curry dishes.  However, the difference between lunch special pricing and regular entrée noodles pricing is just about $.45 cents.  Though the lunch special also will give you a free Tom Yum soup which is worth about $3 so it&#39;s a good deal.  

I ordered a Pad Thai Lunch special that came with the Tom Yum soup and the beau ordered a Pad See Ewe off the regular menu.  Although his order didn&#39;t come with a soup, they gave it to us anyway (maybe it was because I was ordering another dish to go).  I also took a takeout menu with the intention of saving it for reference and saw that there was a coupon for free appetizer of Egg Rolls or Crab Rangoon with purchase over $15.  The owners gave that to us too so in all we got 2 free soups and 3 free Egg Rolls with our order.  They were very nice about it. 

As for the food, everything tasted good and close to authenticity though not the absolute best Thai dishes I&#39;ve had so that is why I gave 3 stars (I&#39;m quite the critic when it comes to Thai food since it&#39;s my favorite). Though don&#39;t let that deter you from giving this place a try because it&#39;s definitely a good place.  I would definitely come back here again as the food and price was fairly decent.  My total bill came out to be about $27 before tip and after tax for 3 entrees.  Oh, and the portions they gave us was very generous too, we ate full and had some to take home."

I ordered to go. From what I saw the place was very cute and quaint. I ordered papaya salad and rice, it was good but a little dry. I prefer a lot of juice in my papaya salad. The cashier was nice and friendly. Id come back and try some of the other food. My rating would be 3.5."

I&#39;ve been to other Thai restaurants and was expecting them all to be the same and the results being pretty much the same.

I&#39;ve been here a few times now and have been impressed each time. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve had:

- Tom Yum (9/10)
- Tom Kha (10/10)
- Crab wheel (1/10)
- Panang curry (10/10)

Tom yum &amp; Kha
I&#39;ve had these both several times at other Thai joints and they&#39;ve always been just ok.  Usually too much meat, too much mushrooms, too much ginger, too much lemon grass or whatever those green spears are that are trying to disguise themselves as green onions, etc. The ratio of everything was great.  When I asked for it to be spicy it actually was.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I&#39;m white and evidently some white people can&#39;t handle spicy, but they actually was spicy.  It sounds odd, but I like the runny-nose spicy.

Crab Wheel
This was just plain nasty. The crab wheels, similar to a potstickers, had no flavor; at least desirable.  The crab actually tasted rotten.  I tried a few  hoping maybe just the first one was bad, but it never got better and the sauce was of of no help. So my advice is to keep away.

Panang Curry
I&#39;ve had this dish at a few other places and have liked this.  Out of the other dishes I&#39;ve had at Thai Places this has become a dish to try much like a ribeye at a steakhouse. All I can say is this was by far the best. I&#39;ve tried this at other Asian\Thai places and they&#39;ve been good, but nothing like this. The consistency of the sauce and peanut flavor are perfect. The chicken is tender and peppers good just right. It is a decent size so don&#39;t go crazy on appetizers. This is a must have dish, unless you have peanut allergies...if that&#39;s the case I hear the Pad See Ew is good.



I highly recommend visiting this restaurant.  A nice environment and the food is great.  You wouldnt think this place is good based on the location, but those are usually the good places to go. I will definitely go again as the food has not yet disappointed me, apart from the crap wheels. It&#39;s consistency has made this a place I&#39;ll go to again and again."

They smelled and looked like they were 2 days old. Peanut sauce was all watery when it should be thick. Even Sriracha sauce doesnt help it go down my stomach. I even opened up the spring rolls to try to find out what was the issue was and found a rotting basil leaf. I offered my dog some and even HE shot it down. That pretty much explains it... 

Jungle Curry with chicken was more like Chinese takeout Chili Oil mixed with vegetables and chicken. The best part of the curry was the string beans. 


Next time I&#39;ll just stick to Chinese takeout!"

The food is always awesome, and the deep dish pie is the best in Chicago.. 

Now, the reason for the 2 star review... I&#39;ve ordered from this location many times, but lately, the people they have answering the phone seem to be untrained or just not too good overall.. I&#39;ve received the incorrect order a few times, but this time in particular, the girl who answered the phone absolutely had no clue what was going on... Let&#39;s just put it this way, our call concluded with her saying &#34;we&#39;ll see you for pick up at 5:30 O&#39;clock&#34;... I pretty much knew that there was a high probability of failure with this order, and let it fly anyways.. 

Well, I was right. Order screwed; incorrect toppings on the most important pie meant for the adults I had waiting at my house... Anyways... Nice save by the dude at the counter. (Receipt said: Steven S.) I told him my order was wrong and he ended up rushing a new pizza for me, and was a good guy about the whole situation. I know people aren&#39;t always going to get things right all the time, but, I just had a feeling about this one, and I was right... 

Conclusion: Give Steven S. A damn raise, as he knows everything going on, try screening employees a little better, and keep serving good pizza."

A favorite thing my friends and I do is the thin crust double stack. We get a thin sausage, mushroom, onion &amp; a second pepperoni, black olive. (Mix the toppings however you&#39;d like) Take one of the pies and flip it upside down on the other. You now have an awesome pizza sandwich!! The ingredient to crust ratio is perfect!

The manager gave out several free pizza certificates to &#34;apologize.&#34; But I had a dozen family members I had to apologize to, because this location lacks the ability to simply bake and hand out pizzas (this is not a sit down restaurant).

For some reason, there were about a half dozen people by the back room chatting. They weren&#39;t working, so I have no idea who they were. Friends distracting people from doing their jobs? Hey kids, you&#39;re working, getting paid - so why not focus on the people who actually pay your salaries? Messed up service here.

And, once we got into our food, it seemed like they were cheap on ingredients, especially the sauce which anchors the flavor of any pizza. This is probably what happens when you&#39;re rushed, baking and understaffed.

You must love chicago deep dish pizza to understand my frustration  I order it UNCUT,  receipt read uncut  but pizza was cut and soggy.  It is like ordering an Italian beef dry but receiving a beef dipped.  Changes the whole experience.  $5 off next order doesn&#39;t make it better which I refused as it is not a solution.  The solution is Get the order right and put the knife away.   

 If you order at their dine in restaurant or any chicago deep dish places, the server brings it to the table UNCUT, and they cut and serve it by the piece to you. to experience the delicious crisp butter crust bottom.  They even leave the spatula to cut and serve your next piece. When I order from lous Palatine which only does pickup and delivery why would they ruin the pizza experience by cutting all the pizzas unless you request it UNCUT.. 

Manager Cindy says cutting is standard policy unless ordered uncut.  I suggested it should be the other way around.  Uncut should be standard and cut should be optional.  She agreed but corporate doesn&#39;t. Regardless you need to get the order right!

  pizza for delivery and pickup should automatically be uncut  to experience the pizza the way it is in the restaurant and the way it should be served.   

Would you like your pizza  Cut with soggy bottom crust?

Lou&#39;s: a classic and always delicious. 

Lou Malnati&#39;s continues to do a great job with consistent quality on their deep-dish pizzas. 

Our favorite is still the Chicago Classic, uncut. Their House Salad with house vinaigrette is a great addition, and leaves you feeling less guilty for wolfing down a deep-dish. Allow at least 45 minutes for this cooked goodness to be ready.

My family has been eating Lou&#39;s for over 20 years. Just disrespectful, and they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. That and they can&#39;t even give proper directions to this hidden location.. Also the pizza was cut not whole,, so all the grease from the cheese and moistness from the tomato sauce leaked through the box, and was coming through it got on my car, and the crust was wet and soggy. Nasty. So here&#39;s an update, the person that commented back to me from Lou&#39;s asked me for contact info so they can make it right... I gave them my email, and they never contacted me. Talk about an awesome small family owned chain, going down the drain for me because of their poor service and carelessness.. Now they finally contacted me, and they want my home address to send $25 certificate. I don&#39;t feel comfortable giving that to them after this experience."

Everything else about this location, not so great.  If you order carryout, never ever believe that the pizza will be ready when they say it will.  Give them at least an extra 15 minutes.  Oh, and pray they don&#39;t get backed up.  On a recent Friday night there was a line out the door to pay.  Hey, it&#39;s Friday, there&#39;s a big game on and people don&#39;t want to cook.  Problem is, when the pies come out they call people by their first name.  You KNOW that on a busy night there&#39;s bound to be two people with the same first name.  Yup, you guessed it, they gave some senile geezer who apparently can&#39;t tell the difference between what a deep dish and a thin crust weighs (and apparently the size difference between medium and large just for good measure) my order.

I never get Chicago style when I&#39;m in town because it&#39;s so heavy and kind of a cliche. I had this at a relative and loved it. Had the sausage and cheese deep dish. So much cheese and good crust. Sausage was thick and juicy. I liked that it was heavy but not the kind where you only eat one piece and you&#39;re full. Basically perfectly in the middle with amazing cheese and sauce.

Ive been ordering from this location for over 7 years. Unfortunately the customer service is a whole different story. It used to be great but lately its been going down. I called them at 7pm to ask what time they will deliver till, they explicitly told me 8:30pm, I reconfirmed because its a sunday, they said no problem at all as long as I call by 8:30. I called at 8:25, lady on the phone tells me they can&#39;t deliver any more. I tell her I just called an hour and a half ago and they told me 8:30, she puts me on hold, a guy comes on the phone and rudely just says we cant deliver, pick it up if you want. I again repeat I was told 8:30, he says well its 8:32, at this point I tell him its 8:29 and I called you at 8:25. He just repeats its 8:32 (I guess my phone, watch, laptop and ipad all have incorrect times) pick it up if you want, I hang up at that point. Now I get I called 5 mins before their delivery cut off, and its not even a big deal to pick it up, but the attitude was the problem. I call back to order the carry out because we have someone from out of town for a night who wanted chicago deep dish, lady answers, takes the order, rudely tells me if you&#39;re not here by 9pm we&#39;ll be closed. Fine I get that too, they have to close, once again its the rudeness and the attitude. My wife gets there at 8:50 anyways because I dont want them to use the 9pm thing as an excuse. She has to wait there till till 9:15 because the pizza isnt even ready. Once again, I get its Sunday, I get drivers have to leave, I would have just picked it up in the first place if they would have decently just said we&#39;re sorry our drivers are done for night. But the over all unprofessionalism was what got to me."

I love that Lou&#39;s finally has a real gluten free pizza.  The first time I had their gluten free pizza it was really the pizza without the mean. The pizza used sausage as the &#34;crust&#34; so if you are meat lover, it is fantastic.  However you could not eat too many of these are it is really too much meat.  

In the last year or more Lou&#39;s has started selling real Gluten Free pizza.  It is probably the tastiest of all the GF pizzas I have tried.  Even my partner likes the pizza and says he can barely tell it is GF.  

So for the GF review, it gets five stars.  This review is for Palatine, Libertyville, Evanston and Lincolnwood locations.

Lou&#39;s is also the pizza I recommend to all my out of town guest and co workers. Everyone liked Lou&#39;s better than the other popular Chicago pizzas."

A tip for carryout orders (Palatine is carryout/delivery only):
Order the pizza uncut so the crust does not get soggy.

Have ordered both deep dish and thin crust. The trick to ordering the deep dish is you must, must ask for them to cook it a little longer. If you don&#39;t, the crust is ALWAYS soggy in the middle (gross!). 

The thin crust is pretty delicious. Never had a bad one! And the prices are really reasonable. $10-12 per pie, now thats a steal!! Some competitors in the area charge $20-25!!! What is on it? Sausage made of gold?

We never do delivery- always take out so I can&#39;t really comment. On a friday or saturday, expect a little longer wait. But normally its about 30 mins depending on the style of pizza. Also, give your pie more time if you request it be cooked a little longer-- again-- a MUST for deep dish!"

For delivery, expect about an 1 hour-1 hour and 1/2 wait. Delivery guys are always nice. Pickup is much quicker with a wait time of 25-40 minutes. In case you&#39;ve never have Lou&#39;s before, be conservative about ordering sausage. I love sausage on a pizza, but this isn&#39;t the same as the ground sausage you&#39;ll get at other pizza places; it reminds me more of breakfast sausage links bursting open all over the pizza. If you really want to try it, I&#39;d go half the first time as I&#39;ve heard similiar feedback from numerous people.

Besides that, order away. Pizza is always hot (and maybe even more delicious leftover either hot or cold), and the toppings are always generous."

This is a very solid option to go have lunch.  One day I was driving in the area &amp; I saw this little burger establishment &amp; decided to give it a try &amp; what a good decision that was.  

My first time here I decided to go through the drive through.  One of the reasons I gave this four stars instead of five was because of the length of time it took to get my food from the drive through.  I understand that when you get good food that is not just microwaved it does take time but I was waiting for over fifteen minutes for my food so I do believe it was a little longer of a wait than I wanted.  However once I got my food I quickly realized it was worth the wait.  

I ordered a cheeseburger with onions &amp; jalapenos.  The burger was very juicy &amp; it sure was very tasty.  The size of the burger was good &amp; it was thicker than most burger places.  Even though I ordered from the drive thru I decided to park &amp; eat on one of their stone tables that they had outside.  

Overall this place was a good find especially for lunch.  The food was very tasty &amp; the portions were good.  I would definitely eat here again if I was in the area."

Spaghetti, fish tacos, burgers, Mexican food, gyros, literally all over the place. Nothing felt like it was well made. 

2nd was the staff, did not think it would take over a full minute to communicate the toppings of one sandwich (was simply adding onion). 

And lastly, no free water. This might seem petty and dumb, but I have been to maybe 2 other resturants in my life that didn&#39;t offer free water. I was told I needed to buy a bottle of water. Basically cost of plastic beats cost of $10+ sale. 

Basically this is on of the shitty side of local Chicago eats, no reason to go here at all when there are much better places extremely close by."

Food tastes bad and has a bad smell to it even the fries. I had a gyro and it was so small but thats wasnt it it tasted like it been siting there for days. It was cold too. The price is on the hogh side 9.50 for a gyro and fries before tax. So ar $11. When i asked the cashier for water she replied we dont give water for free. Its 1.50 for a bottle i said i just need a small cup the faucet is right behind you just fill a small cup. She would not give me a cup of water and didnt even though i had bought $20 worth of food for me and a friend. This place is horrible. No service no food. Just a wast of money. Rip off garbage.

I went there for lunch today around noon.  There were two cars ahead of me, one eventually behind me.  I was locked into the small drive-thru lane for 40 MINUTES!  I kept track, this is no exaggeration. I get 30 minutes for lunch and ended up getting to work 10 minutes late from my break because of this.  I ordered a hotdog and fries - standard faire that should be pretty much ready to go at this type of establishment.  

They never asked the cars ahead of me to move up so they could get potentially smaller/easier orders out of the way.  And when I finally did get to the window, 10 of the 40 minutes was spent between when I handed my credit card and when I got my food.  I had already waited a half hour - not sure why my food wasn&#39;t sitting there, ready to go once they took my payment.  

I even tried calling to see what was going on (since I couldn&#39;t get my car out of the drive-thru lane) and the lady that answered asked if I wouldn&#39;t mind holding, didn&#39;t wait for a response and then just wandered away from the phone.  

I&#39;m astounded at how bad the service was.  DO NOT GO HERE.  From reading the other reviews, calling in my order ahead of time wouldn&#39;t help.  

When I told the lady at the window how upset I was (once when I first got to the window, again 10 minutes later when they finally brought me my food), she said she was going to tell me it would be easier to come in.  She didn&#39;t though, for whatever reason. Not sure why going in would be faster.  

In addition, she gave me a gatorade (didn&#39;t ask if I wanted it or any drink preferences) to make up for me losing pay at work while waiting for $6 worth of hotdog and fries.  

Ridiculous.  Don&#39;t waste your time - so many other better places to go around that area."

1st time- called in an order showed up 10 min later and they hadn&#39;t even started making my food. Got back to the office with a whole 10 minutes to eat.

2nd time- ordered a salad and ended up with a bunch of brown lettuce.

3rd time- called my order in 20 minutes before picking up and sat in the drive thru for an additional 15 minutes. This time I had literally 3 minutes to eat  by the time I got back to work :(

4th time- ordered 30 min before picking up. Food was ready on time, but I ended up with a cold, burnt grilled cheese. 

In addition to all that b.s., the Asian lady that takes orders does not speak good english. Not sure why they have her answering the phone when everyone else there speaks perfect english.

Only came here cause it was super close to the office and I only get a crappy half hr lunch. Thank goodness I&#39;m working a temporary position and will be done in 2 weeks. Won&#39;t ever have t deal with Burger Bungalow again."

The meat must&#39;ve sat on the spit way too long. They should&#39;ve shaved the outer layer off  and thrown it away. It was so hard I couldn&#39;t eat most of it. The tzaziki sauce was just ok.

The meat was good, but all other bits were awful. 
I have also had the cheeseburger and it was &#34;ok&#34;, but not good, and there was nothing special about the hot dogs.  
If you order the sauce on the side, its an upcharge.  Price is a lot higher than the food quality would suggest.  Not recommended."

Burger Bungalow&#39;s menu is nearly as spacious as their 20-something booth restaurant, so I knew I had a choice on my hands.  But whenever a resty has a specific food in their name, I usually tend to go for that.

So a Bacon Burger it was.  Everything on it.  I asked what everything was, and they neglected to tell me that everything includes Mayo (or whatever that white stuff was?  I hope Mayo).  Not off to a good start, Burger Bungalow.

We ordered four sandwiches and Burger Bungalow only gave us three.  GOD DAMNIT Burger Bungalow, this is why I never eat out in Elk Fucking Grove.

The fries were about what you&#39;d expect for a fast food place in Elk Grove.  I think they might have been crunchy, but any potential crunch was droned out by the sound of jetliners flying over my head into O&#39;Hare International Airport.  

I had a bite of the beef and sausage special, which after one bite, seemed like a bit of a misnomer, unless we&#39;re talking about the short bus kind of special.  Which leads me to....

The Burger.

Messy, but not that bad, surprisingly.  I wish it was a bit more burger and less condiments (Ketchup, Mustard, AND Mayo?  What the shit? This isn&#39;t &#39;Nam). But it was still good, and I suppose I could have ordered a bigger burger--an option I fully recommend to you, future Burger Bungalow Burger Orderers of the world."

He recommended this place for us to eat at because he knew it was zabiha halal and wanted to try it out. In addition to this, I saw that it had pretty good Yelp reviews, the menu and food images were enticing, and I am a supporter of small businesses. As soon as we walked in, I was pleased with the relaxed ambience of the restaurant. The dim lighting, classical music, and home furniture provided the perfect environment to study, have group meetings, or just to eat. 

Now, it was time to choose what we wanted to eat. For me, that isn&#39;t the easiest task. Soni was very helpful and provided suggestions to make sure I got something I would enjoy.  I chose the chicken wrap with potatoes on the side, drink, and a dessert of choice for only $9.99 (Most dishes are around this price). My sister ordered the pastrami panini and my brother order the baked French toast. The food all came out freshly made with a pleasant presentation. Everything I was able to try was very delightful and recommended. 

Aside from the food, the service was excellent too. Soni  was genuinely friendly from the start and gave us extra desserts because she&#39;s just that nice:) She checked up on us several times throughout the meal to ensure we were getting a positive experience. Overall, delicious food with even better service! Two thumbs up!"

I had about a half hour to kill before a meeting I had scheduled in the area. Finding local coffee shops in the suburbs is honestly quite the treasure hunt. They definitely exist, but they&#39;re few and far between. I pulled up my trusty Yelp app in hopes of finding a hidden gem, and came across Sugarpill Cafe. With only 2 mixed reviews so far, I decided to give them a go and see for myself.

When I think of a cafe I think warm, welcoming, and delicious. Sugarpill is sadly none of these things. The cafe itself is very dimly lit, almost dungeon like. There was one woman behind the counter and a table of two when I arrived. I immediately decided I wouldn&#39;t be sticking around, so I just ordered my coffee to go. I asked for an ice coffee with skim milk, but the skim milk was a no go. They only had 2 %. Womp womp. 

Instead of making a quick iced coffee behind the counter, the woman disappeared in the back. I thought, alright, maybe that&#39;s how they do things. In the meantime, I quickly ran to the restroom. Once I entered the hallway that led to the restrooms I immediately smelled some sort of... stench. This smelly smell was less than desirable. Better not.

When I came back to the counter my iced coffee STILL wasn&#39;t ready. Really? It&#39;s iced coffee. Pour it over ice and add the milk. Voila! After another minute of waiting, they were read for me to pay. The kicker? This small iced coffee cost me a whopping $4 and change. Seriously?

I have to admit the coffee was fine, nothing special though. Let&#39;s just say you won&#39;t find me at Sugarpill again anytime soon."

A friend brought me here the other night when visiting.  I don&#39;t know much about the area, but this appears to be one of those &#34;hole in the wall&#34; hidden gems.  Off of any major road, and hidden in a teeny strip shopping center, this place would be very easy to miss.  

The establishment is takeout only and apparently family owned and operated.  The ingredients and fresh and have a huge flavor.  The portions are large and I am leaving this review the night after and the leftovers are almost as good as the first serving.  

The tamales are the best I&#39;ve ever had, and the prices are dirt cheap.  They close early, I think around 8:00 or 9:00, so double check before going over there. My only complaint is that they don&#39;t appear to have tostato chips to go with the meal.  I may be an outlier, but I&#39;ve got to have some chips with my Mexican!

There tamales are great usually when i buy tamales they hardly have any meat in them and these tamales have plenty of meat in them which is great. The tacos were amazing as well. I would recommend it. I am very picky when it comes to mexican food but now i found a mexican restaurant that i will be coming back to.

The first time I came late and they didn&#39;t have rice or beans. I was fairly disappointed. The owner, which I believe is the male cook, gave me an extra tamale that I found when I got home. This looks to be more of a to-go type of place, they have 2 tables with odd seating. Food has been SPOT ON!!!! Not only cheap but tastes so authentic and amazing. Sure, I may be white, but I am mexi at heart. I love mexican food and unless it is after 8PM (when they close) I will be coming here for all mexican food. Their tortas are huge and full of delicious fresh ingredients. The enchiladas are UNREAL!!! You will not be disappointed. Give it a shot!"

We liked them so much we decided to go back and get a bunch for a party, not only are they really good, they are very cheap which is awesome! We also tried the guacamole, which is very good, cheap and comes in a large portion. The tacos are great as well! I haven&#39;t had anything from here that I haven&#39;t liked.  If you like good authentic Mexican food, you will love this place. Even family members that are big Mexican food sticklers loved it! I really recommend it, I will definitely be back!"

Did they cut down on their space?) I&#39;d only been to Millrose for a bad (BAD) speed dating event like, 10 years ago... It seems Gino&#39;s is occupying the same space, bar area included. Signage outside is non-existant except for the main raised sign off Barrington Road and a few little parking signs for their delivery drivers.

My mom and I planned to meet on Tuesday evening @5:30. I had called ahead on our pizza, expecting it would take 45-60 to cook, and the guy on the phone was very nice. He stated the cook time is more around 30. Cool.

When we arrived it was clear they were VERY short-staffed. We stood around for a while before we were finally greeted... then, we waited around a while more before we were told we could seat ourselves at the bar, or wait 10 minutes for non-bar seating because &#34;the dining room is full.&#34; (Though the emptyish parking lot and empty waiting area suggested otherwise.) 

We chose the bar. (Unlike Millrose, they weren&#39;t seating patrons in the tier above the bar area.) Alfredo was our server... the only guy in the bar, actually, getting drinks and serving. 

We ordered :

Spinach Mozzarella Sticks ($8)
Garlic Breadstick Knots ($6)
medium Deep-Dish Sausage Slab ($18.80)
Ruination Double IPA ($8)

Apparently Tuesdays are 1/2 price pizzas! Too bad I was using a Groupon and couldn&#39;t take advantage of the discount.

Service was just OK. I guess you can&#39;t expect much when there&#39;s one guy taking care of 12-15 in the bar area alone! I do like that Alfredo gave me a new beer menu after noticing the one he handed me was dirty on the back. 

Verdict:

Spinach Mozzarella Sticks: 2/5
Meh. I love me some spinach, but there was hardly any cheese to really quantify &#34;mozzarella&#34; in the title. These were like eating fried chopped spinach.

Garlic Breadsticks Knots: 5/5
Do you love toasty warm rolls? Garlic? Butter? Yes?! Then these will NOT disappoint! They were soft and surrounded by garlic butter goodness. Mom literally rolled them around in the butter, cut them open, and sopped up the garlic butter like a sponge. THAT good!

Sausage patty: 4.5/5
I&#39;m normally not a sausage eater, but I AM when it comes to Chicago deep dish. That said, our pie was good, but a bit runny sauce-wise, and some parts of the crust bottom were soggy. I&#39;m sure the leftovers will be better, as they always are.


In all this was an A-OK Gino&#39;s experience. I&#39;d come again, especially since it&#39;s a great halfway point between Mom and myself."

I was a bit bummed about the Golf location being closed down. I had really talked up the atmosphere of the place and all its graffiti to my friends as we made our way toward downtown. We were excited about the Iron Maiden concert that evening that we were already six hours on the road for so far, so I wanted to keep the spirits up with my  high expectations.  This place was nice. Big and very empty at 3:PM on a Wednesday. I know, not during dinner and not a busy dining day in general. Still, we were the only diners in the place. 

We were greeted and seated right away and the server was nice. She seemed a bit confused by our Minnesota vernacular, which seemed common among others we met along the way of our road trip. Strange. Questions answered, order in and pizza arrived, our server must have been cut. The dude that replaced her however was awesome. Very polite and personable as well as attentive. No, I didn&#39;t catch his name either; an offense I continue to repeat. In fairness, I didn&#39;t get to keep the receipt this time to check. 

Regarding the pizza, it was good yet like other reviewers stated, seemed to be missing something. Certainly 3-stars in the flavor and 4 in the presentation. Really, it could have just been the atmosphere missed from the other location or todays pizza chef may not have been quite up to speed yet. It was early you&#39;ll recall. 

I mentioned the place was big, right? They also have a big outdoor dining area that understandably has no seating set up this early in the season. Strangely though, they have a couple fireplaces out there that had fires going. Way early before dinner, no seats set outside, so obviously no patrons outside there as well. You can safely assume I&#39;m a bit bothered by that. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a enviro tree hugging nut job (tongue in cheek), however that&#39;s a huge waste of both natural and monetary resources by my calculations. About the atmosphere, I&#39;m not writing to bitch about it. Times change. However, there were signs of &#34;Graffiti Free Zone&#34; tacked up, yet the pictures they must have moved from the old location were completely covered on the frames. Reading this, perhaps I&#39;m becoming anal about inconsistencies or whatever the correct word applied here should be.

Still, four stars due to good pizza with excellent service."

A few years ago they shut down the Gino&#39;s East in the Arlington Heights area.  Since then I have had a hard time finding a pizza place that I actually enjoy.  I have had some pretty gross pizza&#39;s at other &#34;Chicago Style&#34; pizza restaurants.  

I drove by here &amp; saw the sign that they were opening up in the same building as Millrose which is another restaurant.  I must say that their sign is pretty small &amp; cheap but I was still able to see it.  I came here for the first time about 2 weeks ago &amp; the food was awesome.  I ordered some wings as an appetizer &amp; a Gino&#39;s East Supreme pizza.  

The wings were pretty good &amp;came out nice &amp; hot.  The pizza however was by far the best I have had in a long time.  Their sauce was nice &amp; smooth wasn&#39;t gross like most of the other pizza places I have ate at in the past year.  The pizza was pretty large &amp; the price was also pretty good.  There was plenty of pizza left to take home &amp; eat for leftovers.  

The restaurant is pretty big &amp; very nice.  They share the building with Millrose which is another restaurant &amp; because this restaurant is mostly wood walls &amp; more fancy than most of the other Gino&#39;s East restaurant you can&#39;t write on the walls here.  

Overall they had a lot of televisions &amp; they all had either baseball or basketball games on.  The staff was very friendly &amp; the service was very good.  The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because their sign is very small &amp; it was very hard to discover this location.  I have already been here a second time."

The pizza was luke-warm and the green peppers were still crisp. How is that possible? The pizza must be partially frozen first or something. We ended up taking it home to fully cook it in our own oven. The wine list was also very lacking.

First off, we picked up the food, got home and found they gave the wrong kids meal. Running in between after school activities, we didn&#39;t have time to call and ask for what we originally ordered. Then, the fries were so hard and chewy. We picked up right on time and it&#39;s only 10 minutes driving to our house. But the fries felt like having been sitting there for hours. 

The first look of the deep dish pizza when opening the box was amazing. However, the pizza dough was not that impressive. Again hard and chewy. Too much cornmeal in it, and the baking temperature must be off I guess.

Just like my little one commented, although they gave a wrong order and messed up with the French fries and the pizza crust, we should give them a 3 star because the pizza sauce and sausage were really good. Personally, I think they were just okay. I would stick with Lou&#39;s deep dish."

My wife and I were regular customers at Gino&#39;s East on Golf until it shut down. We loved the sausage patty deep dish and enjoyed the atmosphere.

We were overjoyed at hearing about this place opening up at Mill-Rose and ordered a deep dish pizza for take out.

It was good...but not as good as I remembered in the past from the chain. The corn crust was good but missed some buttery flavor and there was something about the sauce. The cheese seemed not to be as gooey It was good...."

The first few offenses were minor.  We had to inform the waiter that the lunch special included soup or salad.  He served the food by reaching completely across the large round table, instead of walking around.  He rolled his eyes when one diner asked for salad croutons for their  lettuce only  salad.  
It quickly went from bad to worse when our lunch order was missing a sausage pizza.  So,  - How does this waiter tell a sausage from pepperoni pizza?   
He took a used fork from one diner at our table and used it to lift a pepperoni off the pizza. He declared the pizza was pepperoni, returned the fork to one diner and handed  the pizza to another. WHAT!!! Did that just happen??  
After we finished eating the sausage pizza made it to the table; so did the manager. 
She graciously apologized and amended the bill in an attempt to save us as customers. 

SO, How is their pizza ? Meh. Sauce was sweet. Crust had a consistency similar to corn bread.  It wasn&#39;t horrible, it wasn&#39;t memorable."

Gino&#39;s is one of the best of Chicago Style/Deep Dish. if you don&#39;t want more cheese than one should consume in one meal, opt for Gino&#39;s. You will see nice proportionate layers of crust, veggies/meat, cheese, and sauce when you pick up a slice of that deep dish goodness. The Sauce is rich and simple, you can taste the tomato, not some sour canned stuff. the crust is wonderful because its fluffy and makes for a great side ( just ask for some garlic sauce). The garlic knots were not the best idea for an app because its just leavened bread and we really dont need more of that these days. The thin crust is surprisingly good for a deep dish shop. We ordered one of each and for once, no leftovers. We came in for a late lunch around 2:30 - the place was empty, has a nice big barn feel with a bar and TVs playing the games of the day. Service was on point and friendly. Couldnt ask for much more."

I had this gut feeling pizza would take a long time so I ordered calamari and bruschetta. It still took over 40 minutes. It was nothing special by any means. The couple next to us ordered a pizza and that took an hour and they received the wrong one. So they sent it back. They waited another 30 minutes for another pizza and once again received the wrong pizza.

It was just lettuce with one sad tomato on it.   Where was the cucumber, the croutons, the mozzarella shreds?   They don&#39;t even have the awesome garlic dressing we used to get.  Then we got our sausage deep dish pizza.   WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!    The sausage had no spice to it.  It tasted like ground beef.   The sauce was very sour.  The cheese didn&#39;t taste like mozzarella.  It was the biggest disappointment.  I don&#39;t even think it was real cheese!    The whole pizza was bland.   We won&#39;t be back.  Ever."

Its not like the original Gino East downtown.  The atmosphere is not the same because you cannot write on the walls.   Also, the service was horrible.  We waited for 45mins for our pizza plus another 10mins for a kids pizza.  Even though the waiter gave us the pizza for Free it was horrible for our kid to wait that long.  By that time he had lost his appetite.  Won&#39;t be back."

I was craving a nice hot deep dish pizza because it was a cold rainy night last night.  I know deep dish pizza usually takes half hour to make so we decided to pre-order the pizza before we left our place (I called in the order and told the person on the phone we would be there in half hour).  We got to Gino&#39;s and got seated (mind you we were on time-exactly half hour) and our server mentioned that our pizza would be out in a few minutes.  My husband ordered a beer and it took the server 15 minutes just to bring that out.  Not sure what the hold up was since they were not that busy.  Our pizza came to the table and it was not hot at all.  Complete disappointment.  We let the server know and he offered to take it back and have it re-heated.  If the pizza just came out of the oven, why is it cold??  Didn&#39;t make any sense.  Anyways, he comes back 10 minutes later and it was slightly warmer but not piping hot like I imagined.  The whole pizza was tasteless.  We tried to get the server&#39;s attention so that he could get us some jalapenos.  He comes back 10 minutes later with 5 jalapenos in a small dish.  By this time, not only did we lose our appetites but we were ready to leave.  Unfortunately, this Gino&#39;s location is nothing like the one I remember from Rolling Meadows.  Don&#39;t waste your time or money, Lou&#39;s deep dish is far better!"

I went with some Latin American friends and let them direct me to delicious options.  I ended up ordering the Lomo Saldatho which is skirt steak chunks onions, fries and rice with a rich gravy.  
My kids had the chicken and rice meal and were quite happy.

Everyone in our group was happy with their meals.  This was a tough crowd to please, because they had expectations for Latin American cuisine that wasn&#39;t Mexican.  Everyone was pleased!  I would recommend this as an authentic place to try Latin American food!"

Fried yuca and sauce with Cuban tamale were the standouts, but all was good (homemade black beans, Colombian empanada, steak and rice with grilled onions, cheese bun).

Don&#39;t get me wrong, my Ropa Vieja was delicious but there was a lot of plain rice with this dish. I also want a fan of the watery style beans.

It&#39;s tucked in a strip mall and could easily be overlooked. But these types of hidden gems are my favorite! The lady at the counter spoke minimum english, but hey, even with my amateur Spanish accent (and the pictures on the walls of the whole menu), my order was accurate. She was very sweet and attentive to our table&#39;s needs.

You order first then sit at the table til your food is ready. It all came out in a timely manner and man was it awesome. I felt like I was eating at someone&#39;s house for a home cooked meal. Even my 5 year old semi-dramatic daughter loved her arroz con pollo  (she liked the orange rice), but loved the tostones even more. The Cuban empanadas were good (a bit on the dry side) but the Colombian empanadas were amazing! And the sauce it came with was good too (I put it on the Cuban one). Cuban tamales are great too.

I&#39;ll come back to try more on the menu, since first impressions were on point :)"

I really wanted it to be a good time but if the empanadas wasn&#39;t cold in the center then it was the clumped up rice that was cold. Best thing was the Coca Cola and the tostones.  The lomo saltado was okay,  but chunks  of peppers with seed stems made it unbearable. The Ropa was alright. I will chalk it up to my tastebuds. 

I have been to other places in the burbs that are more at the level of grandmas homemade Spanish cooking. 

This was left overs from the fridge that was reheated and served."

The service is fantastic! I love that their menu has pictures for every item and that everything is a great price for the amount you get. I would recommend splitting 2-3 dishes between 2 people to try multiple things. 

My favorite dish is probably the Honduran tamale. Their desserts are delicious as well. I had the bread pudding and took one to go!

When we went on a Sat. afternoon, there were many things they didn&#39;t have... so we kept switching options.  The rice was dry (congri),  the cuban sandwiches were very mediocre.

The Ropa Viejo was on the salty side but I enjoyed it nevertheless and I liked the consistency of the black beans that came with it. Also, I had the horchata which is made in-house and delicious, the perfect complement to the beef. The cashier was also extremely nice, suggesting that I try the horchata before I got it to see if I would like it. Overall, I plan on returning to try the empanadas and coffee. 

For the price, the taste and large portion sizes make it worth visiting."

However you can&#39;t beat great food, cheap prices, and generous portions!  I&#39;ve been here twice and I plan on frequenting La Unica quite a bit since it&#39;s close to my office. They serve a variety of cuisines which are Cuban, Colombian, Mexican, and Peruvian.  What&#39;s nice is that the takeout menu on the counter explains each dish and there are also pictures of a bunch of the dishes on the walls to help people decide what they want to order.

I&#39;ve tried the following and all were delicious; you really can&#39;t go wrong with anything you order here.

* Plato La Unica ($9.99 for steak, chicken, fried plantain, rice, and black beans): very tasty and your basic plate if you want to try a little of everything.
*Ropa Vieja ($8.99 shredded beef with tostones, rice, and black beans): this was delicious and I highly recommend.  The beef was flavored well and the tostones perfectly crunchy since it is fried twice.
*Empanada Cubana and Empanada Colombiana ($1.39): I preferred the cubana since I liked the flour dough and ground beef whereas my friend preferred the colombiana since she liked the corn shell better.
*Cafe con leche ($2.75): sweet, creamy,and delicious coffee. Need I say more? 

The only downside to La Unica is their spotty service.  They only have one or two people working so service/food is slow to come out.  I think one table ordered ahead of time because they came in after us but were served before us without having to order at the counter. Definitely check out La Unica for some delicious Latin American cuisine in the suburbs!"

I love Cuban food from my trip to Miami long ago--I didn&#39;t realize that La Unica, hidden in a strip mall in Schaumburg had not only Cuban but Peruvian, Mexican and Columbian as well. The person who helped us explained everything we asked, recommended dishes and told us about each of the unique international sodas.I had the Cuban Arroz con pollo and my husband took a chance on something new and ordered the Lomo Saltado from the Peruvian menu. Both were delicious!! The chicken was well marinated and had a well seasoned garlicky flavor which was complimented by the hearty rice and the sweet plaintains that came with it. There was so much I had it the next day for lunch anf was again so full!! The lomo Saltado is beef stir fried with french fries with onions and served with white rice. So yummy! The best part was the gravy soaked fries in the bottom. Again ...huge serving. We also wanted to try the tostones which are a must...crispy crunchy delicious...even when you are full you want these for the crunchy texture. Great food, plenty of parking, nice staff...but dont expect healthy choices or white linens. This place is for you if you want to get down, get dirty and EAT good food!!!

Not fancy--just formica tables. You order at the counter and sit, then they bring your food out to you. Oh my gosh, someone&#39;s mom must be in the back cooking up these delicious Central/South American dishes. Everything is homemade.

We like to order several things to share; they&#39;re great about bringing us extra plates. Try all the tamales - Cuban, Honduran, Colombian. They are all different and tasty.  The Honduran included large peanuts; the masa on the Cuban was slightly sweet and there was a savory dark sauce spooned on top. The Lomo Saltado was similar to stir-fried beef and veggies with a bit of broth, french fries stirred in and served with rice.  The empanadas are all good too.  We ordered the black beans and rice and they brought an enormous plate of it. Platanos were as expected. They even had pupusas lorocos with salt &amp; vinegar shredded cabbage and mild red sauce.

I didn&#39;t order the Cuban sandwich because they said they can&#39;t get the authentic Cuban bread. The sandwich is probably still good but imho it has to have that bread. There are so many great menu choices that&#39;s a small issue."

At the counter they have pics of their dishes to help you decide what you want. Now this place has more than Peruvian food, they have Mexican, Colombian and Cuban style foods! We got a few items, yucca frita, Colombian style empanadas, Cuban sandwich and lomo saltado. Yucca Fritas and Cuban sandwich were run of the mill and really good! Colombian style empanada was different, they used a masa instead of a dough for the shell and some beef inside, it was good. Now the lomo saltado was GREAT! I&#39;ve had many lomo saltado dishes and this one was right up there with some of the best I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s a Peruvian stir fry where they put onions and some peppers with strips of rib eye steak then they add fries to it and give you a side of white rice with it. This stuff is so freaking good!

What I liked was how we can make our orders at the register and decide on what to eat by looking at the pictures of food on the wall. The waitress was able to provide details on most of the food items as we ordered. I tried the Lomo Saltado and my dad had the Cuban sandwich, plus plantain and sopa de garbanzo.

Starting with the guy taking orders, with a ponytail. He was wonderful. It was our first time and he, without prompting, took us through each of our choices and added his thoughts. He was so good and so helpful.

We decided to get as much variety as possible. We ordered the Cuban Plato la Unica
La Unica special: steak, chicken, rice, black beans and fried plantains. And on the Columbian side we ordered the Mountain Man plate: Chicken, egg, chicharrones, fried plantains. We also ordered two empanadas, the Cuban and Columbian. 

The empanadas were outstanding. If we had just ordered the Cuban one (flour), we would have been very happy. However, the Columbian empanada (corn) was outstanding. As soon as it hit my tongue? Delightful!! The wonderful guy behind the counter offered they were both good, but he preferred the Columbian one. Agreed.

The black beans were so good, and the plantains were the best we&#39;ve ever had. So well done. The chicken was moist and very flavorful, loved it. The chicharrones weren&#39;t for us, and I don&#39;t think we&#39;d order the steak again. Too many other great choices.

And again. Thanks to the guy with the ponytail. He was so amazing, and it was obvious he cared about the food.

Oh, and there are pictures on the walls of all the menu items. Pretty cool. We will definitely make the half hour drive again and again."

This place is nothing to look at, but the food is great. The boyfriend and I picked up the Ropa Veija and the namesake platter to share. The steak and chicken were fork tender and flavorful, and the pulled beef was properly spicy and juicy. The red salsa is hot!  How rare. The plantains on the side rounded out the meals perfectly. The black beans are a little watery, but taste great. We will be back."

The employees are so friendly and non-judgmental if you pronounce something the wrong way. Don&#39;t know what it is? Just ask and they will describe each and every item on the menu. The end result is an incredible flavorful meal that will make you want to come back for more.

Why not 5 stars? Nobody is perfect! :-)"

I should have paid attention to the other reviews. The cuban was just ok. No sliced pickle or if there was, couldn&#39;t taste it, decent flavor, but very dry.

Now, the cuban empanadas? Oh baby, were they good. I started eating one right in the car. The dough was fried to perfection and the ground beef is delicious. You could easily do 2-3 for lunch (or 4 or 5). Yum.

So much so, that we ordered some bread to go and she did not give them to us. We had to go back and ask for our purchased items. 

The food: nothing to brag about. This stablishment favors quantity over quality, serving an exagerated amount of bland food. But, what can you expect for 10 bucks a &#39;dish&#39;.

I would explore other avenues before considering to return to this place."

I wanted to find a place near work that served Cuban sandwiches. When I saw the extensive menu of Latin American food I had to try it out!

The food was great. I ordered a Cubano sandwich and a side of Flautas de Pollo. The Cuban was tasty but I feel like it could&#39;ve been a little better. It was made right but instead of swiss they used Queso fresco cheese, which actually was a good substitute. It also needed more pickles and mustard BUT it was still really good and definitely worth the price! The flautas de pollo were AWESOME. Simple but totally delicious, you should definitely add some to you meal. I got them plain and they were still great.

The service was nice and friendly, but I was disappointed to see that there weren&#39;t more people dining there. I&#39;ll definitely be back for sure.

The only reason I&#39;m giving 4 stars is because it took a bit of a wait for my food to come out. I ordered my food to go, but waited nearly 15 minutes for it to come out. That&#39;s about the only negative, otherwise the meal was great!"

Upon finding out about this place, I instantly went into nostalgia mode and flashbacked to my Florida days of eating from a tiny cafe with cafeteria style servings of Cuban food for lunch. 

With high hopes, I first tried the Plato La Unica and then the Carne Guisada.  At $9 a plate, I expected a ton of food and that is exactly what I received. The Unica had steak AND chicken BUT the flavors were unusually bland. Excessive amounts of hot sauce was needed to give the dish some semblance of flavor.

The Guisada was a favorite go-to dish for me back in Florida so I had higher hopes for this dish. It was definitely an improvement over the Unica but I was still underwhelmed. I guess my nostalgia may have distorted my expectations more than I expected. The meat was overcooked but the flavors were acceptable.

This place is NOT cheap at an average $9 per plate but quantity is enough to feed two people for lunch easily. They try to fatten up the dish by giving disproportionately large amounts of rice in an attempt to justify the hefty price.

If you&#39;re into coffee, the cafe con leche was spot on, be it a little on the sweet side, and kept me from falling into a rice induced food coma after eating my lunch. They also have a great collection of many different ethnic bottled/canned drinks that are not easy to find.  

The seating area is pristine, maybe even borderline sterile, because everything is brand spanking new. I haven&#39;t tried eating in but I believe you order and pay up front first, then the food is brought out to your table. A crew in the kitchen can be seen from the front counter preparing your meal to order.

La Unica serves Cuban, Columbian, Mexican, and Peruvian dishes so I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back again to try different items, such as the Cuban sandwich and empanadas. I suspect they might be trying to cover to many different styles of food, diluting the ability to excel at any particular genre well but only time will tell if this place gains any traction at such an obscure location with such high prices. They have a Chicago location as well and I have to wonder if they dare charge the same prices in a less affluent neighborhood.

Overall, I&#39;m glad this location exists but I think some adjustments are in order. Worth a try if you&#39;re in the area but be sure to bring an eating buddy to tackle the heroic portions."

Wow--this is just really, really good cuban food. Not that I&#39;m an expert, but I spend months each year in South Florida, eat a lot of cuban, and in my view, this is outstanding.

Had Ropa and it was meaty, tender, seasoned well. The plantains were terrific and cooked perfectly, beans/rice solid as well.

The real star of the lunch though were the cuban empanadas. The filling was just nicely seasoned chopped beef, but the pastry was fantastic--crispy, light. Halfway through, I ordered two more to take with me.

Also, even with a coupon, which is often the kiss of death at places, the service was terrific--friendly, committed, checking often...

Do yourself a favor if you have not been here--try it!  I wish I lived closer."

We had: lomo saltado (great, just a little heavy on the papas), congris (delicious), a cubano (WONDERFUL), bistec (cut thin, which my mom isnt&#39; a fan of but my sister is, so to each their own), fried yucca and yucca al mojo (both great). 

The food comes in somewhat odd order, but it&#39;s just one person manning the front, so that&#39;s understandable and didn&#39;t cause us any issues. 

The cafe con leche though, my god, it&#39;s a religious experience. We still talk about it a  week later. I asked for mine iced, which wasn&#39;t on the menu, but the gentleman still made it for me and it was great. I frequent Cafecitos in the city and it tasted just like that. 

We ate comfortably and enjoyed the tv playing Univison in the background. For four people, we paid $38 after tax. Just what we were looking to spend. 

The place is very clean, quiet, and welcoming. The gentleman who helped us was patient and understood our enthusiasm.

The Mexican enchiladas were just weird, no sauce, just chopped raw red onion and lettuce on top, no cheese, ground chicken.  Yuck.  The saffron rice was OK.  The black beans were OK.  The Mexican tamal was too spicy and the masa to meat ratio was ridiculous, almost no meat.  The Honduran tamal was OK, again too much masa, not enough meat.

If you are looking to try something new other then typical  low budget taco restaurants come try the food here.  They don&#39;t have tacos on the menu but they do serve them upon request.

I am so glad to find Cuban cuisine without having to go downtown. The first and only time prior to La Unica that I have ever experienced Cuban cuisine was in South Beach and I&#39;m pleased to say La Unica has best that standard. 
The dishes are averagely priced but you get a lot of food. I ordered the bacalao and was impressed with the amount of fish I got. It lasted me 2 meals and the rest are still in the fridge. I love that there is a mix of different backgrounds and lots  to choose from on the menu. 
I had been craving tostones since the only time I had had them in Miami a few years back and I&#39;m so happy I can get the locally and well made anytime now. Also, I consider myself a foodie while simultaneously being a health nut and I was very impressed that the filling inside the empanadas (tried both the cuban and colombian) was not excessively fatty or glistening in fakeness however still incredibly flavorful. Needless to say I am Impressed and want to see this place stick around :)
Also for an independent business in a middle class area, the restaurant is very well-kept and nice to look at. I haven&#39;t tried it yet but can&#39;t wait to try the authentic flan with how good it looks ;)"

The Cuban Sandwich was cooked well, had plenty of meat but i felt it was a touch dry next time i&#39;ll ask for more sauce. 
The Relleno Potato was also ok, the meat could have used more salt and pepper but  it wasn&#39;t anything i would write home about

I ordered the Cuban beef stew with rice and plantains ( not sure if this exact name, but if you say that to the man at the cashier he would know what you talking about) and it was really good.  The plantains were cooked to perfection and portion of food was very generous. Also, be sure to try their green homemade sauce. It is a bit spicy, but went good with the rice and meat.

For under $10, I walked away over stuffed and a happy man."

Ok bottom line.  I have eaten at Wicker Park more than 20 times.

My one complaint, you have to have an airline ticket to get to it.   Bummer.  

Last night I was at the Hilton for early flight out next morning.  No way to get in the terminal to enjoy Wicker Park.

The chefs are skilled and do not skimp on portion size. The service is nice and everything appears clean. Taste, texture and smell suggests that the pretty flesh pieces are fresh. They offer some decent sake and beer of Japanese origin but also have a few American beers to satisfy peasants like me.

If you want a sit down meal at terminal 2, your choices are pretty limited: Chili&#39;s, Stanley&#39;s, and Wicker Park.  The line at Wicker Park was much shorter, and the choices seemed much healthier, so it was our obvious choice.

I had a draft Kirin, the seaweed salad, a yellowtail roll, and an eel roll.  With the tax and tip, the meal was just under $50.  The food took a while to arrive, probably since it was Friday night and all the seats were filled.  The ginger is bright pink, the wasabi is a dense paste (didn&#39;t disperse easily in my soy sauce), and the soy sauce is poured by your server (rather than taking up space on the side table).  The seaweed salad was ok, a decent portion for $7, and chilled but not too cold.  The rolls were a little loose in the wrapping, and some pieces fell apart.  The fish tasted relatively fresh."

I enjoyed a nice steaming hot bowl of Udon soup with tempura shrimp and it was perfect!  My travel buddy had rolls and nigiri and said they hit the spot.

Service was &#34;zombie-like&#34; with the server reaching over my left shoulder on one occasion without saying &#34;pardon me&#34; or words to that effect and another worker replacing the napkin and chop sticks before I could even move my things after I ate. There was also residue from a prior customer on the counter in front of me - with no attempt to clean it up before the aforementioned action. Lastly - the water tasted like it had a chemical in it; possible use of ice that is used to chill wine or beer or glass not properly rinsed.

The sushi is ok. It&#39;s not stellar but as far as airport sushi goes it&#39;s on par. 

My qualms are both wait times and price. The service and wait is not great. As an airport restaurant you have to know that the question folks want to know is how long will it take to get my meal. If you don&#39;t know that, or if the wait time is consistently long, you drop a star in my book. Waiting 20 minutes when you&#39;re out for a leisurely dinner is no problem, waiting 20 minutes for take out at an airport is long.

I had maguro, sake, and hamachi sashimi with unagi nigiri. The only one with a modicum of flavor was the nigiri because of the sauce. Couldn&#39;t taste the eel. 

I swear that they served me the same piece of fish painted three different colors. The flavor was indistinguishable--mushy, empty. Like protein blocks. 

Thought I&#39;d take the plunge having only seen the stars and not read reviews--too hungry to wait. I understand tastes vary, and I&#39;m not digging on others&#39; palettes. But I can&#39;t imagine what they ate to make this place a four. Obviously not what I ate. 

On the bright side, the service is friendly and super fast food delivery. The veggies on my plate (daikon, cukes, and pickled ginger) were very fresh and refreshing. But I didn&#39;t spend almost forty bucks to enjoy radish.

I had a layover on the way from New York to Alabama. About three hours to kill during dinnertime, and this place looked really appealing (although I&#39;m not typically a fan of sushi; but love Japanese). So I popped in and grabbed a seat in the bar area, overlooking the tarmac (kinda cool to watch the planes come and go).

I&#39;m only giving this place three stars because while the food was fair (more on this later) the service was pretty slow. Granted, I wasn&#39;t in any kind of hurry given the three-hour layover, but I did want something to drink pretty quickly. It took about 10 minutes for someone to come over and acknowledge me, and I know this wasn&#39;t an isolated instance because a little later a gentleman came over and sat near me, and waited so long he eventually got up and went to the bar to order his drink himself.

I finally did put in a drink order, and subsequently a food order. Like I mentioned in the first part of the review I&#39;m not much of a sushi person, but I decided to kinda step out and try something different...in a conservative way. I know some people probably wouldn&#39;t classify cucumber and cucumber/shrimp tempura rolls as sushi, but that&#39;s what I had and they were both decent. Nothing to write home about (does this saying crack you up as much as it does me?), but not terrible by any means.

In addition to all of the traditional sushi items there looked to be a couple of pretty attractive salads as well as soups and heftier meals. I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t go back here again if I ever have a stop over at O&#39;Hare, but I&#39;d definitely choose a different dish."

Today I tried the Hot Night Roll, the Negi Toro Roll (fatty blue fin tuna), and the Hotate nigiri sushi (Japanese scallop). 

The Hot Night Roll was fairly standard and not particularly interesting, even though it was billed as a specialty. It was a little spicy and the tuna tasted fresh. The tempura shrimp seemed a little stale without much crunch.

The Negi Toro Roll was absolutely delicious. The tuna was melt-in-your-mouth and was well-balanced with the scallions. If you haven&#39;t tried Toro, you should. 

The Hotate was the real highlight. It was absolutely the best I&#39;ve ever tasted. Sweet, flavorful, and wonderfully fresh. None of that &#34;fishy&#34; taste.

Sure its a bit pricey but for ORD its definitely one of the best restaurants. The reason for 5 stars though is not the sushi. It&#39;s the Udon. I totally agree with another yelper who said this is the best they ever had(I&#39;ve been around the world and Japan several times). You gotta try the beef udon(or soba). It&#39;s perfect. They only serve noodles till 3pm.

Complaining about prices in an airport when the food is this good requires one response: Go to the food court!
The food is excellent, the staff is usually good (big crowds at peak travel time degrades service and time to plate) but overall, there is very little to complain about. In fact, I walked from the farthest C gate to get a meal here because the food in other restaurants in the airport either is just OK, or it is crowded due to its location to the gates.

Frontera grill, my normal &#34;go to&#34; Ohare restaurant was just too packed and hectic to contend with.

I read the other yelp reviews and decided that I would know exactly what I wanted to order before I sat down.

In and out in 1/2 hour - but another 15 to finish my beer. 

By airport standards the food was good and service great. Total with 20+% tip was $50 for a a Sam Adams and a typical Sushi entree, which included Miso soup.

When we came in on a Tuesday night before seeing a movie at Marcus, the place was buzzing. We split a brisket meal, in order to keep things lighter before the movie. I loved all the different BBQ sauces that was at arms length. The brisket was hot and moist. The mashed potatoes had good flavor. I liked the corn bread as well, and the waitress seeing that we were sharing, brought us an extra one.

On the plus side, service was good, food was plentiful, and prices were reasonable. 

The burnt beef ends and St. Louis style ribs were tough, and the sauce was way too sweet and sticky. Catfish strips were mainly batter, with little fish or fish flavoring. Cornbread was soft and mushy, and the mashed potatoes were cold.

Came here today and experienced utter disappointment. Got the two meat combo (which has gone up in price) with tips &amp; hot link, beans &amp; fries.

So why 3 stars &amp; not 1 or 2? This location still has good service. Our waitress was really nice. She got my order wrong at first but quickly fixed it. I can respect that.

I stopped in and ordered at the carryout counter. There I met the nicest employee. I wish I remembered her name (this visit was Friday 11/14/14) because I really think she was the sweetest person I&#39;ve ever met at Famous Dave&#39;s. Anyhow, I was trying to decide on appetizers and she suggested catfish fingers. Well I had never had them before and before you knew it, I was tasting one with the dipping sauce. Great suggestion!  I ordered them. 

While I waited, I could see that the whole kitchen staff was busy. There&#39;s no standing around here. That was nice to see. Our food was packed up nice and easy to carry and out the door I went. I did spend about $100 and they did offer to help me carry it out, but it was packed well and I was easily able to manage.

Its BBQ- not 100% authentic but definitely good enough for me (Hence only 4 stars)! Now Chicago does have some great BBQ joints but Famous Dave&#39;s is close to home and you always know what your going to get. It is also reasonably priced. Around $15 a combo meal (two meats and two sides). 

This location particular has really fun friendly staff for the most part. I&#39;ve never got a rude server. Its also in the same lot as the movie theater so its perfect to go buy your tickets and then go grab a bite to eat while waiting.

Years ago we had a Famous Dave&#39;s 5 minutes away but they disappeared and this location 20 minutes south is the closed one. Most places within that radius only have 1 or 2 BBQ items and typically it&#39;s for diversity rather than their signature dish. All it takes is a BBQ show on TV to get you craving brisket, burnt ends, and rib tips. Since driving an hour to the city for worthy BBQ at not-so-cheap prices isn&#39;t always an option it makes sense to slum it occasionally.

A couple friends and I made it here and lucked out with outdoor seating away from the families and annoying kiddies. This place has definitely changed, the food isn&#39;t as good as I remember. The burnt ends are new and since nowhere around offers them I was all over them. Not what you expect them to be, not that they were inedible. Our server was great and brought out a small order of their chips and I thought they were good with the sauce. No more drunken apples??? Lame. The entree was a brisket and chopped pork combo, which was ok. The good thing about this place is you can squirt on one of their hot BBQ sauces and forget about the meat not being juicy or flavorful enough. 

If I could command my family to bust out our grills and smokers for some excellent 8-12hr smoked Q whenever I want, then I would. For simplicity&#39;s sake I&#39;ll rely on Dave&#39;s or another spot when in a pinch."

Delicious! The ribs were meaty. I love all the sauces at Famous Dave&#39;s. I especially like Rich and Sassy, Georgia Mustard, and Sweet n&#39; Zesty. I usually alternate sauce between bites. I had to pay extra for some pickles on the side. I do love their hellfire pickle chips! Lots of BBQ places include a few pickles with their brisket, but whatever. I got a $5 special margarita. It was huge and strong. I enjoyed the food a lot. I didn&#39;t like that the server told me that they weren&#39;t allowed to box my food for me. Some people prefer that.

However, I think I&#39;ve tried better ribs elsewhere..like at the Naperville Rib fest....

We ordered Dave&#39;s Sample Platter, the Feast for 2 with the brisket and shared it amongst 4 people (females, if that makes any difference..).  The food was more than enough..and we had leftovers.... it probably was not necessary to order the appetizer platter because our stomachs would have been content without..but we were just extremely hungry.. :) ...the appetizer platter was good as we were hungry...


there wasn&#39;t anything really special about the food that would urge me to want to go again..unless maybe I was craving ribs or my friends wanted to go.....it&#39;s not a bad place to go if you&#39;re craving ribs and just want to hang out with friends/family..."

I chewed half and sent the other half back with the waiter. The sides were OK.

Service was spot on; &#34;Famous Glo&#34; our waitress was absolutely the best.  She came by as soon as we were seated to ask if we&#39;d been there before &amp; take our drink orders.  She was extremely patient with all our questions &amp; requests (What would you recommend?  How much are the drinks?  The bottles of sauce?).

I came with 3 other girls and we split the Dave&#39;s Sample Platter (appetizer) and the Feast for 2 with the brisket which was all more than enough for us (we still had leftovers!).  I have to say that the ribs in our appetizer were much better than the ribs in Feast and the pork &amp; beans were not to my liking.  But everything else was delicious!  I love how they have the 6 different sauces on the side to put on the ribs &amp; chicken.  I think my favorite had to be the brisket.  Also ordered a Sweet Mama&#39;s Punch &amp; liked the sauces so much I bought a few bottles to take home.

She was very slow to get to us the whole time we were there but it seemed like she was the only person working so it&#39;s not her fault.

Yes, it&#39;s a chain restaurant, but its a fun atmosphere with decent variety of smoked, grilled, fried and roasted treats!! Our most recent trip this past weekend was a great. Kimmy was a wonderful server. A lot of energy, knowledge, and a great attitude. She brought us a cup of their homemade chips and encouraged us to try their sauces. I always use their &#34;Rich and Sassy&#34; when we visit, but for the first time, I actually ventured to taste their other sauces. Their &#34;Georgia Mustard&#34; was a great addition to the Country-roasted Chicken breast. I asked to trade in my corn bread muffin and corn on the cob for some of their Cream of Chicken Wild Rice and Kimmy was quite accomidating. 

The manager was kind enough to stop by for a chat and we got to share our feelings about their food. The reason for the missing 5th star is because, they are not the best about timing out the food. Our meals came out within about 5-6 minutes of us placing our order. It&#39;s almost as if they want you to know the food was ready before you got there. Not too crazy about this. I also am not a big fan about the non-fried sides we ordered. The mac &amp; cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes were not exactly what I would call &#34;hot&#34;.  I would love it if they took a little time to heat these items better before service. 

I know what I&#39;m getting myself into when I come here. Never a wait to get a table, good service, friendly staff, fun atmosphere, and always leftovers!!! 

A few tips:
-Great Ranch Dressing
-Cream of Chicken w/wild rice soup is killer
-Ask for Kimmy or Mario to serve you.
-If you want a spaced out meal, let your server know ahead of time.
-Don&#39;t overdo the soda if you&#39;re heading to movie afterwards, you&#39;ll miss a good portion of it! They serve large cups of soda here.
-Drunkin&#39; Apples are a great side option if you are looking for a sweet treat!"

The two stars are for the rib tip dinner, it&#39;s not the greatest but decent. But the order of bbq pulled chicken nachos... Completely disgusting.

Wasn&#39;t a fan of the ribs, but that&#39;s because they are St. Louis style, and that&#39;s just not my thing. Since I was Famous Dave&#39;s virgin, they gave me a bunch of coupons, a couple packets of the different sauces they have, and a bottle of BBQ sauce. Pretty nice, but I wasn&#39;t sure if I would go back. 

This past weekend, my boyfriend really wanted to go back, especially since the movie theater was right next door and that&#39;s where we were headed after dinner. I wasn&#39;t thrilled, but I figured I would give it another shot.

This time around I had the pulled pork dinner and it was delicious! Definitely a great option if you don&#39;t want ribs. I ordered a side of broccoli which was cooked very well and steak fries. The cornbread is always the best part but everything was so good. I also liked the BBQ chips our waitress brought out, which allowed us to try different sauces that are on the table. This location also has great and friendly service. Our waitress was very attentive. Glad I gave it a second chance because they have a lot of options to keep me happy."

All the side dishes are tasty. But for what you pay for the food, they should give you a bit more. I&#39;ve only ever eaten take-out from here, so maybe it&#39;s different if you dine in. 

I think I&#39;ve had food from here about 4 times, and only once did I feel like a fair price was asked for the food I got. That cajun chicken sandwich with remoulade is pretty decent, and I feel is fair value for money. The entrees all feel like rip-offs, though -- especially the fish platters. 

It&#39;s fine if you&#39;re socially obligated to indulge, but it&#39;s not a place I&#39;d ever choose to go on my own. The flavors are good; they just need better pricing.

I have ordered the burgers there before so I had an idea what I was getting for the money. When I got back to work and opened the box I was very surprised how small the portion size was. The pulled chicken was on a bun that you usually see in a package of 8 for 99 cents at the grocery store. There was about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of chicken on the sandwich. Got approx 1/2 cup of mac and cheese in a small container. Included were 5 pickle slices. I think they mixed my order up with a children&#39;s meal. Granted, everything was delicious, but incredibly small for what I paid. I could have easily eaten twice what I received. Quality of the food was high but value for the dollar was very low."

You can also substitute the sides with others if you&#39;d prefer.  This feast comes served on a garbage can lid as a tray which we find pretty amusing.  I would say that each feast easily feeds about five people.  Personally, I like the fact that you can try a little bit of everything and not have to settle on one choice.

Our service at this location has been pretty good.  They are usually pretty attentive and fairly quick.  Once they see you slowing down, they happily bring several containers so that you can wrap up whatever you want to take home.

You get a pound of tips on a mound of fries. These tips were pretty tasty. The portion size was large but I still ate them all. My friend did exactly the same.
They have a new sauce here in their collection called Wilbur&#39;s Revenge. It was pretty hot. Not deadly hot, but it definitely is the hottest of the bunch.

The service was good.  Brisket is hit or miss.  Sometimes it is just right, sometimes a little dry.  The ribs are not as good as other bbq places around the area like Sweet Baby Rays.  Their dry rub tended to be a bit on the dry side.  The St. Louis was meaty but not quite as tasty as other places but not bad either.

It offers average food but the sweet potatoe fries are excellent.  The salmon was also pretty good.  The BBQ is pretty average."

Wings were not the best I&#39;ve had but they were good. Corn on the cob was good. I liked the Devil&#39;s Spit sauce they had. I&#39;d come back if I&#39;m in the area for lunch again. 

Best of all, they gave me a little care package for being a first-timer. How nice is that?"

Went here yesterday for my birthday. I had a birthday coupon where you get a free entrée with the purchase of an entrée. Since my mom and I haven&#39;t been to a Famous Dave&#39;s in a while, we decided this would be a good choice. From the minute we sat down, to when we left, the service was great!

Our server brought out a plate of homemade BBQ chips (this must be something new as they never did this before). She also asked if we knew the breakdown of all the different sauces. Come to think of it...we didn&#39;t. We&#39;ve been to Famous Dave&#39;s countless times before and not once has anyone ever explained all the sauces. She took the time out to give a description of each sauce, which was great. There was one sauce I never touched in the past but found out that I really liked. Oh, there is some new sauce they bring out that has a red cap and &#34;XXX&#34; in the name. Don&#39;t touch it! For the love of God, do not touch this sauce!!! Our server also took the time to explain the difference between the rib cuts.

My mom ordered a slab of ribs and I ordered the entrée where you can choose 2 meats. I ended up getting rib tips and beef brisket. Now, this is no fault of Famous Dave&#39;s, more a personal preference, but I didn&#39;t care that much for my selection. Never having either, I assumed the rib tips would be bone-free and that the brisket would be similar to pulled pork. Both were still tasty but probably not something I would order again. I also asked for some of the Hell&#39;s Fire pickles and our server happily obliged. Also, our server surprised us and brought out a huge dish of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and whipped cream! Happy Birthday to me!!!

I strongly suggest signing up for their email club and sharing your birthday. Nothing is better than free food!"

So on one of my visits here (again with the husband) we ordered a variety of bbq ribs, chicken, appetizers etc.  We found the ribs were good but a little bit on the dry side.  Each table had plenty of bottled bbq sauce so my husband was able to drown our ribs to make up for the dryness.  We got some corn bread, regular fries and our appetizer had fried string onions, chicken tenders, etc. (Just okay)  Overall the atmosphere was nice, there was a crowd, and the service was good.

There is one thing I wanted to share.  I have this thing for sweet potato fries and decided to try theirs.  Although the bbq was not all that I expected, the sweet potato fries were awesome.  It was a good portion, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside... It also came with a marshmallow/orange/cinnamon sauce that you could dip... and Man!!  It really hit the spot for me.  I don&#39;t remember the exact price but I found it was a little bit high for fries... (I think it was $9 bucks.)

I would recommend this place if you need a bbq fix.  They have everything from pulled pork, to ribs, to beef brisket....and even bbq pork nachos.  If your anything like me, you have to try the sweet potato fries.... Cus this would be the only thing that I would be going back for."

Our server had no problem keeping track of split orders, shared dishes and special requests. She checked on us regularly, and two other workers stopped by the table to make sure we enjoyed our food.

I was a bit disappointed in my baby back ribs, which were lukewarm and a bit tough. The server mistakenly brought cole slaw instead of beans, but she was gracious about the mistake and didn&#39;t yank the slaw. 

The beans were a bore. The mashed potatoes were good. The corn bread was a bit too refined for my tastes.

Next time I&#39;ll order the large pho with extra noodles on the side to get a better bang for my buck.

Edited : I ordered an adult pho tai since the two kid sizes weren&#39;t enough. My 5, 3, and 1 year old finished all of the kid bowls and the large pho except probably one adult bite and some beef. Hope this gives you an idea of portion. Definitely tiny. Other local companies offer kid portion pho that equals this restaurant&#39;s adult portion. So not only is this place pricier but their pho is so much smaller. Their pho broth is good though so I give them 3 stars for being close to home and quality of pho."

But the traffic has been so bad in Schaumburg with all the work on Roselle and PlumGrove Meacham I have twice stopped here recently, and again I still can&#39;t recommend it. Pho&#39;s a little saltier than I like, same for the Tiawanese beef stew, portions sizes small, thin.

Nothing compelling in any kind of ambiance either, looks a lot still like one of the earlier breakfast diners incarnations that I preferred. It is well lighted and spacious in there with a lot of window seating, booths are large and comfortable. 
Give House of Pho a try on the other side of Schaumburg, they are on a roll lately and have better lunch specials and a happy hour lunch menu that goes to 5. Too bad Viet House is gone, they were the Best. Good luck."

My friend &amp; I arrived around 5:30pm on a Saturday. The place was empty. An older man with grey hair (maybe the owner) looked at us suspiciously the minute we walked in. I said we were meeting 2 more people, so we&#39;d need a table for 4. Again, he was acting really weird. Gruff and no smile. And looking around the place like the 2 people we were waiting for were going to pop up and say &#34;BOO!&#34; or maybe he thought they were figments of our imagination. Our friends finally showed up like 3 minutes later &amp; the dude did not lighten up. The guy kept setting off unwelcome vibes. Honestly, I would have left but my friends had picked this place &amp; had their heart set on Vietnamese food.

First person places an order by giving the name and the number off the menu (Co&#39;m cá, Grilled Fish, D07). Gruffly, he was looked where she was pointing at the menu. Next person orders by giving the number &#34;D01&#34; to make it easier for him. He gets cranky &amp; says &#34;You can just say the name!&#34; Ooooook. My turn, so I say the name &#34;Minced Pork Rice.&#34; Does not register. So much for following his suggestion we just say the name :-\ He looks over as I turn the  menu to face him. I say &#34;A13&#34;. Does not register. Cranes his neck to see, so I point at the item on the menu. I felt like I was bothering him by placing an order.

Now, I know this dude can be friendly, because a party of four Vietnamese people walked in &amp; his demeanor completely changed. He was all smiles... which was quickly replaced by this gruff countenance once he stepped over the invisible line that was surrounding our booth. We were never rude to him. No matter how polite we were and said &#34;thank you&#34; (a lot), he reacted gruffly. I felt like we were an inconvenience.

The food came out and everyone seemed to like their dishes. My choices were hit or miss. The fried pork egg rolls were good. The minced pork was OK. The pork belly gua bao bun was dry.

When it came time for the bill, we gave a combination of cash and credit. Grumpy guy came back with the credit card and receipt for a signature... and HOVERED AT THE TABLE until the receipt was totaled and signed. And then he took the signed copy and left. I found that very insulting. It&#39;s like he thought we were going to ditch the bill.

We left the place, no courtesy &#34;thank you&#34; or &#34;good bye&#34;.

The food was nothing outstanding and I was bummed about the guan bao that I had ordered. I&#39;ve had better Vietnamese food in Chicago.

The Culver&#39;s down the street has MUCH better customer service. The ambiance here was so off-putting and the employees gave off a weird vibe. I definitely won&#39;t be back (and I&#39;m sure they could care less) and I definitely won&#39;t be recommending this place to friends and co-workers."

Apparently not a whole lot other than its a popular Vietnamese soup.  I&#39;ve only had it once before and based on my experience here, it seems I lack in the Pho dept....

Seeking to try it again and craving comforting hot soup, I read some great reviews and being only 10 min away, I came to To Pho.  Nice sized casual restaurant in an outdoor mall.  A very nice, helpful Asian man took my order to go.

Salt &amp; Pepper Squid, Pork Belly Gua Bao, Pan Fried Dumplings and I decided on the House Special Pho (sliced steak, brisket, meatball, tendon and tripe) and Pork egg rolls.

I asked for extra tripe for my Pho because I enjoy tripe.  I&#39;ve never had tendon before, but thought I&#39;d give it a whirl....everything else sounded familiar to me.

I absolutely LOVE squid and octopus and was surprised to find really nice chunky pieces. Fried in a salt &amp; pepper flour mixture...exactly like it sounds, but more flavorful.  The menu indicates &#39;spicy&#39;, yet I didn&#39;t find any heat in this dish.  I really like spicy, so it could be that I have a higher tolerance to heat.  The squid itself was soo good. No frozen calamari rings here. Super tender pieces with chopped pepper and garlic...The ONLY downside was that it was pretty greasy / oily.  It was definitely glistening, otherwise, this would have been perfect.

The Pork belly Bao was decent...Soft bun, nice slice of pork belly cooked and seasoned well with a few sautéed greens and crushed peanuts.  I can&#39;t stand Cilantro so I took it off my bun.
Although I liked it, I felt the bun overpowered the pork... Dumplings were good and filling was more tender compared to others I&#39;ve had.  The free order of Pork eggrolls were super crispy, not oily and tasty, with average filling. (coupon off of website).

Pho is HUGE and comes accompanied with sprouts, lime wedges, fresh basil leaves and jalapeno slices.  I asked if they could make my pho spicy, so he offered sriracha and chili oil on the side...excellent!!  Here&#39;s the thing - I liked the noodles and broth had great depth, but it was rich in sodium.  I felt it, I could taste it.   I&#39;m also not a fan of Cilantro.  It just tastes like soap to me.  You either love cilantro or you hate it...well, I fall into the latter....I must have forgot they use cilantro because I would have requested without...it was clearly stated on the menu (looking back).  Either way, I could really taste it, and at first glance thought it was parsley. So I added every single last basil leaf and lime wedge...but it was still there.  Since this was clearly my mistake, I sucked it up and ate as much as I could...

Another thing - -  I didn&#39;t enjoy the tripe here.  I&#39;m aware there&#39;s various types.  It looked like tripe. White, but very long thinly sliced...you could mistake it for a noodle.  It was also crunchy.  Is it supposed to be crunchy? I think not.  All I know is, the tripe I eat is always super tender (lamb or beef).  Maybe this is something I&#39;m not accustomed to with this type of cuisine, but I wasn&#39;t eating it with any gusto...in fact, I could only handle so much and left the rest...

My first time trying tendon.. I&#39;ll just say its not for me (luckily they only threw in a few pieces). Somewhat chewy, somewhat gelatinous.  All you tendon lovers out there -  more for you! Other than that, the brisket flavor was ok, eye of round tasted better.  Meatball was good, but hey I&#39;m Italian, so of course I like meatballs :P

I&#39;m sure given the absence of cilantro, I would have enjoyed the broth more. The meaty essence was there, but the sodium/msg really stuck with me.  I had so much soup left over that I heated it up the next day.  This time the broth was plain (no garnishes, no meat) and I added left over noodles. I can honestly say I didn&#39;t care for it.  I detected a slight sweetness in the broth.  This may be a personal preference, but I didn&#39;t finish it...

I certainly don&#39;t discredit To Pho for my rather adventurous choice of Pho and mention of cilantro..I&#39;d give them another try with the Seafood Pho..(when in doubt, I go the seafood route).

In all fairness, I felt most everything was OK.  Squid app being the standout, minus the oil...
I&#39;m not really sure if Pho is my &#34;thing&#34;....yet, I plan on continuing my adventures until I figure it out..."

It was 5pm and the restaurant was pretty dead except for 2 other tables, 1 that included a screaming kid. After I was seated I got a whiff of something that smelled like a dirty mop, but I proceeded to order anyway.  

I ordered Pho Ga, the serving as most pho was very generous. The chicken in my soup tasted different, I dont really know how to explain it other than a little gummy and thin. The smell of the dirty mop never went away and never really made me feel comfortable eating my food. 

So the final verdict is: Viethouse will continue to be my go to spot for pho, nothing around here has been able to top it on taste or cleanliness."

The only reason for three stars is that we recently ate the lunch specials.  I must say that I feel robbed. Lunch specials are supposed to be a good deal.  We had a table of four and each of us ordered a lunch special.  The taste was good but it was kids portion sizes.  We needed to order two more lunch specials to fill us up. I would pay the extra $1 and order the full size portion. Do not order the lunch menu unless you are a very light eater.

I wasn&#39;t fully happy with the service the moment I sat down. I had to ask for silverware and the pair they gave me had some nasty dried up food on it. I had to request another one. I wanted chili paste sauce and they had none. 

I was craving Pho and thought I&#39;d give these guys a try. I wasn&#39;t super hungry and wanted to order the kids Chicken Pho. The lady, who was my waitress (probably the owner) said I couldn&#39;t order that. She said it was only for kids! If that was the case then they needs to write that in their menu!

That&#39;s not even right!
First of all I am a paying customer. Secondly, I don&#39;t like wasting food that I can&#39;t eat. Third, Pho does NOT taste good afterwards when it&#39;s reheated. 

I wish Viet House didn&#39;t close down because there&#39;s hasn&#39;t been a Pho place as good as them!"

I had been longing to try it after seeing it featured on many of the cooking and travel channel shows. After frequenting a restaurant that only serves Pho, I was happy to find this place because of its large menu. A nice big bowl of Pho Tai Nam was absolutely delicious. My wife and I shared this as I was also able to try another Vietnamese specialty, a Banh Mi sandwich. I had the house special sandwich which consisted of pork belly, pork roll and ham served on a French Baguette with mayo, cucumber, carrot and daikon with cilantro and jalapeño. It was out of this world! I will definitely be a frequent customer here."

The prices are super reasonable. They even have lunch specials on Saturday. Service can be a bit slow here. 

For appetizers, I enjoy the little egg rolls (I am not a fan or big ones) and the pot stickers are just okay (go for the crab Rangoon instead). I highly suggest ordering a bubble tea to go with your meal. 

The last time I came here I ordered the spicy beef with scallion and onion. It was yummy, but they were not kidding about the spicy part! I enjoy a bit of spice, but this one was a little too much for me. Good nonetheless, I was just being a weenie.

The service was standard for this type of restaurant, no-nonsense to the point and quick.  We started with the vegetarian cold spring rolls and aside from the peanut sauce to dip them in they were quite bland. There was a very tiny bit of cilantro so the filling of plain tofu &amp; plain rice noodles was just blah &amp; required a generous dip in the peanut sauce to make it edible.

My tofu &amp; vegetables pho was very good &amp; came in a huge bowl. Tons of noodles in a delicious broth with lots of veggies along with plate on the side of additional garnishments (mound of bean sprouts, basil leaves, slices jalapenos &amp; lime wedges).  Incredibly filling and had I not skipped breakfast that day I probably would have taken half home.  I would prefer they cut up the huge veggies &amp; big slices of tofu a bit smaller as it was difficult to eat (one does not look very ladylike shoving a ginormous broccoli floret in her mouth with broth dribbling down her chin) but that seems to be how most places serve it.

The Hubs ordered the shrimp fried rice which had a nice flavor to it but only had about 10 very small shrimp (I&#39;d say they were the small popcorn size shrimp) in the whole gigantic plate of rice.  Based on the huge amount of fried rice the shrimp should have either been larger or there should have been a lot more of them in the dish."

Full of flavor they should do a spicy tofu like that for the bahn mi.

Potstickers I was not a fan of.  It&#39;s the thick wrapping with that fragrant smelling pork inside.  Not a fan.

Order Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce n got water crest greens instead.  But was still good.

To Pho is definitely a nice place to grab some tasty pho. The service was very friendly and attentive. The interior of the restaurant gave me kind of an old-school diner feel. I ordered pho with sliced steak rounds and beef balls (which is my go-to when trying new pho places), as well as their spring rolls. Both were very good and tasty; very much liked the broth here.

(Still don&#39;t know how to pronounce that?  it&#39;s basically said &#34;FAH.&#34;)

It&#39;s  a small place in Schaumburg, where fancy pants restaurants lean towards places like Mortons and Ruths, and casual places are more along the lines of Hooters  or Buffalo Wild Wings.

It was immaculate, and we were seated and waited on promptly.  I opted for the special pork  Bahn Mi, with pork roll, ham, and pork belly, dressed as per tradition with mayo, shredded carrot, cilantro, cucumber and daikon (Asian radish). The baguette used was spot on perfect, could have been from a street bakery in Paris.  Flaky soft exterior, soft as butter in July inside.

Mrs. Burgerdogboy must have not been feeling rightly, as her usual tact is to cram as many calories into a meal as possible, so usually she would have gone with the pho that had beef and pork, and she would have ordered a double side of extra fat back.  But she had the chicken.  The broth is served with traditional accompaniments, including  lime, sprouts, basil, and cilantro.  In the broth with the rice noodles and chicken were green onions.  She be a soup fiend!  I have seen her take an entire week&#39;s worth of groceries and make them into a single bowl.  Truly a magic act (except for trying to figure out dinner for the balance of the week).

We had the spring rolls as a starter, shrimp and pork mixed with rice noodles  and sprouts with a side of peanut sauce.  The  rice paper wrappers were clear and tightly wound.

This place is great. Ultra fresh, great value for the money.   Plus if you buy four sammiches, you get one free!  The restaurant is in a strip mall at 823  E. Algonquin Road in Schaumburg.  Neighbors in the mall include a Chinese restaurant, liquor store, tarot reader and a Subway."

Aside this lack of ambiance, To Pho has flavor, variety, and a waiter named Hoba:)
Seated at 6, and greeted promptly. As I often do when I first meet my server, I asked a variety of quick, somewhat random, menu related questions and, voila, I met my waiter for the evening and his great personality.
I love spring rolls, so that&#39;s where I began. I&#39;m also, always, super hungry. So I asked my wonderful guide what his favorite appetizer was, and ordered the crepe.
The spring rolls arrived, fresh, and paired with a perfect sauce. The two were almost gone when the crepe arrived. 
It looked like an egg quesadilla, or a taco shell made of egg, housing flavorful meat and sprouts and paired, as the rolls, with a delightful sauce that lightened it up. Oh, and you eat it by wrapping it in a lettuce leaf! 
Try it- it&#39;s a remarkable melding of color, texture and taste!
Main entree was Pho with brisket and steak, wonton noodle soup, and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. The portion sizes are immense, and, while a valiant effort was made, I wasn&#39;t successful in my attempt at cleaning my plates. There was enough for two, Meg-sized meals!!!!
The Pho was delicious, from broth, to noodles, to fresh jalapeños, basil and bean sprouts. Chinese broccoli was cooked to perfection and seasoned with garlic and oyster sauce. 
Not that there was room for dessert, but there also wasn&#39;t a distinct dessert offering in the menu. 
It&#39;s not a great first date, it&#39;s the kind of place you bring your friends, old or new, to enjoy the food and company.

There&#39;s a deal which offers the customer a free sandwich with an order of five sandwiches which may sound a bit extreme, but is definitely worth it after you finish a cross country race. The bowls of soup are a bit too big for my tastes, but the bigger the better, right? Service-wise, the waiters are very nice and willing to accommodate to any special requests.

Decided to bring a friend here for a &#34;quick&#34; dinner.  They sat us in a corner booth and our food came out fairly quick.  

No one came to check in on us and ask how we were doing.  Not once.  

So we finished eating and sat...and sat...and sat.  Finally I flagged someone down and asked for to-go containers for the rest of our soup.  She brought one.  I asked for another for my friend, which she brought.  Another person came to drop of our check and promptly cleared my friend&#39;s soup before she could wrap it in her to-go container.  

So with our money sitting in the middle of the table and no waitress around, we sat some more.  I flagged someone down again and explained what had happened.  We sat some more.  

Finally, someone came out and said they made her a new soup.  That&#39;s was nice, but the amount they filled the to-go with was less than she had left in her bowl.  I know this because we had the same amount of soup left in each of our bowls and after I had filled my to-go, it was almost full, hers was less than half way full.

We sat some more.  I was in disbelief at how much we were being ignored. I finally got up and brought our money over to the area where the &#39;Pick Up&#39; orders pay for their food.

Our quick dinner turned into an hour plus of sitting and waiting.

This is the service industry.  The quality of your food alone will not keep your customers coming back.  Your attitude to them will.

I&#39;m vegetarian, so had scoped out the vegetarian options on Yelp before I went. My friend and I split the vegetarian spring rolls and they were tasty. The peanut sauce definitely made them. I&#39;d gladly eat both of them by myself the next time, LOL.

I ordered the vegetable pho with tofu and was very pleased. As others have said, you get a giant bowl of very fresh vegetables, tofu and noodles cooked in a fairly plain but tasty broth. They bring a plate with bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves (with a delicious anise taste - and I hate licorice), sliced jalapenos, and lime wedges to add at the table. I&#39;d eaten too much for lunch and dinner, so the pho was the perfect entree for me. Healthy and light. I could only eat half and brought the rest home. I can&#39;t wait to finish it tomorrow. I felt  like I ate a terrific vegetarian meal that didn&#39;t bust the calorie budget in any way. 

My friend had a spicy chicken dish that she also felt was fresh and also very spicy. She had to ask for more napkins to deal with her runny nose. So their spice level is pretty spicy We&#39;ll both definitely be back to try more things!

Our server was attentive and very helpful. We got there at 5 PM on a Wednesday night and were the only patrons in the place. But by 7 PM, quite a few more customers were enjoying their meals."

I got the L9 pork belly and it was a huge miss. I don&#39;t expect Momofuku quality or anything but the meat they used was very low-quality. It actually went into the trash and now I&#39;m left hungry. They do give large portions though. My garbage can is pretty full. Lol. I also got a Thai Iced Tea which was average at best, very one-dimensional in flavor. 

I&#39;m kind of pissed because they made me spend 10+ bucks in order to use my credit card and with that amount of cash, I could have gone to Toasty Cheese or somewhere else that uses high-quality meat. 4 stars my as*.  If places like To Pho rate 4 stars on Yelp, then places like Toasty Cheese should rate 10 stars. I was tempted to give it a 1 star but I like to give second chances...

It was oh so much pho and oh so good.

I had been in a mood for shrimp, so I ordered the seafood pho, which did not give specifics on the menu of what exact seafood was included. It just said &#34;seafood.&#34; But I was rewarded for my bravery.

It had the shrimp I craved along with crab and scallops. The beef pho base was perfectly spiced, and the noodles were just the way I like them -- well cooked but not mushy or gummy. 

I also had a Thai iced tea, which I would happily ordered again, and a barbecue pork gua bao, which is kind of like a steamed bun taco. And it may be my new favorite thing.

Grandpa is in a less and less mood to eat meat, but I still wanted to take him for a good meal, so I pulled up the trusty Yelp app and found me a list of potential spots to check out for my weekly visits!  Marketed as a Vietnamese/Taiwanese restaurant, they have a mix of dishes from banh mi to pho to gua bao to rice plates.  It&#39;s got a lot of options, so I figured this would be a good place to start.

We ordered up two huge bowls of lunch special pho (which comes with an egg roll btw), one appetizer of spring rolls, and one order of pork belly gua bao.  Here&#39;s the skinny:

Spring Rolls - Simple, tasty, and fresh.  I think I was expected more flavor to the shrimp itself, but with the dipping sauce, it&#39;s pretty damn good.  

Pork Belly Gua Bao - While the pork belly isn&#39;t as soft as I&#39;d like, the veggies, peanuts, and sauce make up for it a bit.  Decent dish, especially for $4, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d get it again.

Pho lunch special - Not bad!  $6.25 for a huge bowl of pho, one egg roll, and all the nice veggies to go with it.  Seriously, the soup alone will fill you up good.

Service was fast, friendly, and non-intrusive, which is always nice to find!

Total bill came out to $24 AFTER tip.  Considering we got tea, two appetizers, and two big bowls of pho, that&#39;s not too shabby!

Verdict:  Quality of the food really is three stars, with the fourth star from service and affordability.  Portions are generous, and an easy place to chow down for reasonable prices!"

Service was awful... we first didn&#39;t know if it was seat yourself or wait to be seated and then after waiting literally 5 minutes someone came and said they would seat us. Ten minutes later we were finally seated. 

We ordered the banh mi.. they&#39;ve americanized it and add MAYO to it (would recommend to get it without). The daikon wasn&#39;t all that flavorful. 

Everyone was eating Pho- which is probably the way to go.

They have a frequent Banh mi program- the more you eat you get a free one.

I would come back to try to pho."

As with most trips, if I have time, I always try to look up yelp to see what&#39;s close to my hotel.  Found this place that&#39;s between ORD airport and my hotel, and it had good rating.

As the name implies, I was expecting a Vietnamese restaurant.  When I went in, the first thing I noticed was the Chinese music they had, and they had Chinese dishes on the menu.  The owner and most workers are all Chinese.  But since I was craving Pho and Bahn Mi, I decided to stick to my original plan and just ordered the combo on Pho and combo or house special on bahn mi.

This was yesterday (Monday) around 2p, so there were not many people.  The order came about 5min later.  

Bahn Mi
If I had to rate this separately, it would be a 1 star.  First off, the meat they used I&#39;m pretty sure are bologna, along with some slices of roast pork.  The veggies were ok, but it lacks the crunchiness or perhaps the freshness.  Then there is the mayonnaise, which was very sweet.  Not sure if they added some sort of sweetner, but sweet bahn mi with bologna was not what I had in mind.

Pho
For $8.5, I expected larger bowl.  OK, I&#39;m from TX, so perhaps the sizes here are larger, but that was OK.  One thing I noticed was the soup didn&#39;t have much cilantros if any, and all the they really should have cut the tripe as it was just a large clump that I had to chew and chew.  The flavor didn&#39;t pack the punch as it was very generic.  

Overall, I was a little disappointed as yelp had high review for this place.  Perhaps their Chinese dishes were better as they were mostly Chinese workers, but I went there because of their name to suggest it was a Vietnamese restaurant.  So if you&#39;re craving Vietnamese, I would try somewhere else."

To Pho opens for lunch which is perfect as we&#39;re early birds. They have a variety of lunch specials and just a huge menu selection in general so it can hard to decide on what to order - I def need to go back to try more dishes. This week I tried their Kom thit kho as my inaugural dish. $6.25 for this dish and it&#39;s a big portion! Kom thit kho is a pork belly stew that comes with a ton of rice, a couple of hard boiled eggs and some veggies. Don&#39;t let the stew name fool you though as there is no broth in the dish. I was super happy to find no juices because I wasn&#39;t feeling soup but wanted pork belly!

It was a great dish and definitely worth the $6.25 I paid! As I said, there are just loads of dishes to be tried so we&#39;ll be back. I would mostly compare this to House of Pho also in Schaumburg and I think To Pho is actually a bit better. Service at To Pho was helpful, attentive and friendly."

Shortly after it opened, I ordered takeout from there - had their Bun Ca Ri Ga (Curry Chicken Noodle Soup).  And, it was wonderful.  At the same time, I ordered one of their Bahn Mi sandwiches - their house special, to take to work for lunch the next day,

Over the past month, I have not really been well so have not gone out too much.  When my wife suggested we get out of the house for dinner, the thought was wonderful.  It was my pick, so I chose here - this time, we would eat at the restaurant.

The location To Pho is in has changed hands many times over the years.  It was Palmers for a long time, then another place moved their from down the road which did not last.  If I remember right, there were two or three other restaurants there prior to Palmers,  I sincerely hope that To Pho lasts.

This time, I ordered a rice vermicelli dish called &#34;Bun Thom &amp; Thit Nuong&#34;.  This was a mixture of rice vermicelli, shrimp and pork,carrots, daikon, lettuce, cilantro, bean sprouts and crushed peanuts served with a fish sauce.  To be honest, it was a little bland for me.  But, I added a shot of plum sauce and a shot of sriracha and the meal came to life.  Kerrie got a barbeque pork Bahn Mi, and Jon got a different version of what I got.  The service was great - local owners who have a vested interest in succeeding are usually great.  And, they lived up to the expectations

Inside it is nothing fancy.  It looks like they simply took down the Italian poster from the prior owner and added a few from Vietnam.  Inside it simply looks like a diner, but who cares?  Unless you want something really fancy and all you care about is great food, that&#39;s what matters.

Before leaving, remembering how good to Bahn Mi sandwiches were, I ordered a couple to go.  I got another house special, and this time I also got a barbeque pork.  I don&#39;t think I mentioned - the sandwiches are served on the most wonderful french bread rolls.  Because of the French occupation of &#34;Indochine&#34; prior to the Vietnam War, there is a heavy french influence on the Vietnamese foods.  The sandwiches are large (about the size of a good sub sandwich), on much better bread, have great vegetables included jalapenos.  And, they are $4 each.I&#39;ll tell you, you cannot find a $4 sub anywhere in our area 1/2 as good.

So, kudos to the owners and to the chef.  If you are in the area, stop in and enjoy.  It will be worth your trip."

$7 for a meal (Ma Po Tofu) that was big enough to act as both my breakfast, lunch and dinner. A meal that at the time of the first meal, appeared bottom-less. A meal that felt remorseful after finishing the last bite, knowing I had not rationed well enough to last to the next day. It&#39;s okay though---I&#39;ll be back. Probably Monday. 

Honestly though, with price vs portion like this, why would anyone ever go to McDonald&#39;s? Super-size your ish here. 

I had a hot tea because I wore inappropriate footwear for the day and my feepers were freezings and I needed to warm up. I was hoping for standard green tea, but instead it was a personal pot with jasmine green tea---which I normally hate because it tastes like chewable baby Tylenol, but there&#39;s tastes different. It was more like Lavender green tea, though it did remind me a bit of laundry detergent, but by the end of the meal I kind of liked it. The dude got a Thai Iced Tea that was off the hook. I know, I know -- I totally just used that phrase. Sue me. It really was that f*cking good, though. 

I ordered the Ma Po Tofu and asked for it to be served extra, extra, super spicy as my boo had gotten the same thing earlier in the week here and reported that despite the chili pepper next to the dish on the menu, that it wasn&#39;t very spicy. The server laughed, repeated the order back and asked if I was sure I wanted it &#39;super, super, spicy&#39;, and I affirmed. 

Our first dish up were vegetarian spring rolls. They come 2 huge bratwurst-sized rolls to an order and they were great. I might consider ordering 2 orders of this in the future as a meal, and doused in a butt-load of Sriracha. 

When my dish arrived I was shocked by the sheer size. It was almost a literal trough of food, wish was perfect because I&#39;m an American and I love to overeat. It makes me happy and I don&#39;t care if it makes me fat. Fat and happy---that&#39;ll be me. So anyway, our server (who was super cool, probably around my age and super quick with the jokes) brought out a cup of their hot chile oil in case the dish wasn&#39;t spicy enough. The food was fantastic on it&#39;s own with silky tofu chunks in a sauce that was heavy only in appearance, and otherwise went down in a light-as-a-feather manner. I like my food to be make-your-nose-run-and-your-butt-burn level spicy, so I used the entire cup of chile oil. I think I could have used a whole second one if they&#39;d brought it (which our server offered) just because the smoky flavor of the oil was so addicting. 

My boo got the Homestyle Tofu and it was defo a far-off second place from my Ma Po Tofu. I wasn&#39;t a fan of how think the sauce was, but the tofu was cooked exactly how I always *try* to cook tofu at home, only MY homestyle tofu turns out burnt as sh*t or not cooked enough at all. Kudos to To Pho for doing it well. REALLY well. 

I realize most people come here for pho, and I certainly wish I could speak to that, but since vegetarian pho isn&#39;t a real thing (just like vegetarian sushi---sorry, but that&#39;s not sushi) I stuck to a regular dish. They do have a vegetable pho on the menu that says &#39;no meat&#39; in parenthesis, but it just means there&#39;s no meat chunks in it, it&#39;s actually in chicken broth, though. 

In the end our meal for two with two entrees large enough to last for three more meals, one appetizer, a $0.50 hot tea, and Thai Iced Tea, cost $22 and some change. A steal if I&#39;ve ever seen one."

Also got the Taiwanese Gua Bao, T01, the pork belly. Again, nailed it on the flavors... not too bland and Americanized, not too savory and over seasoned. It was a great mix of textures and balance.

Not all Pho are made alike. I was excited about trying this restaurant since a good pho here would mean less trips to Argyle. We came at dinner and was surprised that it was not that busy. We were quickly seated and they were able to take our orders quickly. The fried egg rolls were good, nothing spectacular. Fried well without too much residual oil. The pho combo which has everything had different types of the protein brisket, beef, meatballs etc. However I agree with the other reviewers the soup seemed to lack the depth and richness of other pho that you get at tank pho. It was good, but not something I would crave. Service was fast and friendly which is a plus.

I am so happy that they opened up and they are not too far from me. Perfect place to go for dinner when I don&#39;t feel like cooking, after golf, before church... actually I am down to go to To Pho just about anytime.

Their pho is consistent (and consistently good). Regardless of what time you&#39;re coming in, the broth will never be watered down like some other places I&#39;ve been to in both the city and the burbs.

The service is great. Food comes out piping hot and extremely well paced between appetizers, main course, desserts, etc. The timing here is awesome because regardless of how busy they are, the food is always served on time and the servers never appear to be rushed.

I usually order the chicken wings, gua bao (pork belly is my fave), salt and pepper squid, or spring rolls for my appetizers. All of them are very good.

Pho is tasty. The meat, the broth, the veggies - they have always been fresh. I sometimes have to pick out browned sprouts or browned culantro/thai basil. I never put jalapenos in (I give those to my husband) but those have always been very fresh as well.

I&#39;ve had a couple of their banh mi (their house special is my favorite!), their salt and pepper shrimp with head on is HUGE (I always have leftovers because they give you so much), their lunch special curry, their cold noodle dishes, etc.

Bubble tea here is the best around the area. One of the servers knows that I always order the lychee bubble tea with little tapioca. Their tapioca can be a hit or miss but I would say 80% of the time, it&#39;s been perfectly cooked. I&#39;m extremely picky about bubble tea but I enjoy it from here, especially on a hot summer day."

As others have stated, House of Pho is probably the only other good choice in the area. In general, most of the Chinese and Vietnamese dishes are similar in quality to what you&#39;d find in Chinatown. The prices are good and portion sizes are generous.

Mango smoothie and taro smoothie: Similar in flavor to what you&#39;d find in Chinatown if you weren&#39;t going to Joy Yee. Good flavor, good texture.

Pork belly gua bao: A little dry on the pork belly for me and I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the mustard greens.

Banh xeo: Very nice and crispy, good mix of flavors and just enough meat to be satisfying.

Shrimp &amp; Pork rice vermicelli: One of the best in the area. The pork and shrimp are grilled very nicely and not overcooked. This contains your usual mix of vegetables and the noodles are served slightly warm. Equal to House of Pho in quality for this dish.

Pho tai: It&#39;s not amazing but not bad either. My expectation for pho in the suburbs isn&#39;t very high so this would be considered good for the area but average overall.

3 cup chicken: Infused with flavor and has a nice soft texture. This preparation is quite different from others you&#39;ll find in the area and worth a try. It&#39;s more of a stir fried chicken meat with soy sauces than a traditional 3 cup.

Beef chow fun: Above average for the area. Good texture on the beef and good flavor.  This is prepared Cantonese style so it is really a Gon Chow Ngau Ho.

Chicken wings: Crispy, good size and flavor.

Vietnamese iced coffee: Strong but the coffee is not overextracted so it is not bitter. Good level of cream and sugar so it&#39;s pleasant but not like candy.

Taiwanese beef noodle soup: Pretty spicy, good mix of beef brisket and beef tendon. This is an item that&#39;s difficult to find in the area and I think people who like spicy soups will really love this.

Shrimp fried rice: Done well with a good amount of &#34;wok hay&#34;.

Pan fried seafood noodle: Very generous on the amount of seafood and the noodles are crispy. 

Mapo tofu: Tofu has a nice flavor and texture, sauce isn&#39;t too spicy. If you want something spicier, try Asian Bistro nearby."
tô-pho-schaumburg-3,Pari P.,6VKK6L4BP4rQqKYZSkL1eg,"Schaumburg, IL",1,1,1,37,60,J7c2K0t5hMiF_MUUNoMQOQ,5.0,2013-04-22,"There&#39;s a second Vietnamese restaurant in Schaumburg?! Jumping Jupiter, Batman! 

Schaumburg has a lot of restaurants but most are chains and without much variety. I was excited to hear that a new Vietnamese restaurant opened. We ordered the house pho, spring rolls, grilled pork bahn mi, and the sizzling crepe. The bill was only $20 even after ordering four items off the menu. Don&#39;t bother with the lunch specials because they are only .75 cents cheaper than the regular prices. For .75 cents more, you get twice the amount of food. 

For &#34;pho-natics,&#34; you&#39;ll critique the subtle differences in the fish sauce, broth, and bahn mi bread but overall, it was really good for the price and location. Even though Pho Ha is still king of pho in the Chicagoland area, To Pho satisfied my Vietnamese craving without having to drive out to Bloomingdale.  

I&#39;ve read the comparisons to House of Pho and here&#39;s my verdict. To Pho has better food, period. House of Pho has better lunch specials in terms of value but To Pho&#39;s menu is more diverse with items like gua bao and the sizzling crepe. The sizzling crepe was the best thing we ordered - it was delicious and is definitely a must try. For $5, it&#39;s a crispy crepe stuffed with pork and shrimp served with pickled vegetables and lettuce. Eat it as you would a lettuce wrap and it&#39;s the perfect combination of Vietnamese flavors and textures. This one dish is worth going to To Pho alone since there isn&#39;t anything like it in Schaumburg. 

To Pho or not to pho? That is the question... and the answer is yes. To Pho is now one of my new favorite (cheap) eats in Schaumburg."

I really do not know what spices are in the soup, but its pretty damn near perfect.  Plus you don&#39;t have to drive to Argyle street in the city with a place of this caliber out here.

I&#39;ve been meaning to get myself into Tô Pho, and being sick was the perfect excuse.

Prior to our most recent visit, I had only picked up some spring rolls to take home on a couple of occasions.  I&#39;ve ordered both A01 Fresh Spring Roll that is made with shrimp, and A02 Fresh Vegetarian Spring Roll that is made with tofu.  Both cost a measly $3.50 and are not skimpy by any means.  The vegetarian spring rolls were really loaded up with the tofu! 

Most recently when we went in, we were greeted at the door and sat by a very welcoming host.  Our server on the other hand, was a bit cold, but here&#39;s hoping it was a cultural difference.  Another friendly male server lended a helping hand while our server wasn&#39;t around.  He wrapped our food, and processed our check for us.

We started off with the A03 Fried Pork Egg Roll.  Do not order these egg rolls.  I repeat, DO NOT order these egg rolls.  After ordering, they came out at record speed, as in literally under a minute I believe.  Our waitress literally walked into the kitchen, and then presto!  I understand them being made ahead of time, but precooked and then reheated on the fly?  Ick.  They were so dry, and the sauce they were served with didn&#39;t help matters.  Unfortunately, I can say that these were by far the worst egg rolls I have ever had.  Stick to the spring rolls, people!

For dinner, I went with P09 Pho Do Bien, which is a seafood Pho.  It was good, but I&#39;ve had better.  The seafood they choose to throw in could use some upgrading.  My boyfriend went with the Bahn Mi Vietnamese Sandwich.  The bread was crusty on the outside, and a bit softer on the inside, the way it should be.

At Tô Pho, the prices are right.  I&#39;m willing to go back and give some more options on the menu a try.  I love me some pho and am glad they are close to home.  Guess I&#39;ll have to wait &#34;pho&#34; the next time I&#39;m a bit under the weather."

When I moved away from the suburbs 2.5 years ago, I pretty much had to drive to Chicago for good pho.  Now I&#39;m back to visit, and we have options for where to go!  This was definitely the best out of the places I tried.

Pork belly gua bao - 4/5
The bun was soft and moist but had cooled off quite a bit by the time the bao arrived at our table.  The pork belly was pretty much perfect, flavorful and tender.  The veggies and peanuts added a nice mixture of textures, but the mayo kind of overpowered the rest of the ingredients.  Would order it without the mayo next time.

Pho - 4/5
Got the pho with everything.  The broth was very flavorful and came in a generous portion size.  We got plenty of sprouts to add to our pho as well.  The meat was good, but I would have liked a few more pieces of it.  

Bahn mi - 3/5
I got 2 bahn mi to go, and ate one later that day.  Ingredients were fresh, but I think the mayo threw off the flavor a bit.  Also wish the bun had a crunchier crust.

Overall, definitely a great place for a good meal.  Would definitely come back again."

The end.

Well, not really...but pretty close. To Pho is very unassuming from the outside but this little strip mall locale is a gem. I&#39;ll give you the skinny....

Portions: As referenced, BIG. From the lunch specials to the Bahn Mi, you won&#39;t go hungry. 

Price: Almost comically affordable. Three very hungry ladies ate plenty with leftovers for at least another meal for each of us...with tax and tip the bill was just under $30. 

Flavor: Classic Vietnamese offerings and flavors. My house Bahn Mi was packed with three styles of pork stuffed into a huge French bread loaf with typical trimmings. Tasty and filling, for sure. It&#39;s worth noting that the BBQ pork buns are also really delicious and a total steal - 2 for $4.

Service: Super friendly all the way around.

To Pho is to-tally great."

If you don&#39;t like tomato sauce then you should try this out. The sauce was very creamy and went well with the spaghetti and shrimp. The spinach dip was a miss for me. I usually love it, but this one was too dry and we barely finished half. The avocado rolls was pretty good. It was very rich and filling. 

The customer service was good. Our waitress kept asking us if we needed anything and refilled our waters. I think we sat there for almost 3 hours and she never rushed us to leave."

We felt very ignored for most of the night. Overall service was very very slow.

First, she messed up our order and brought us the wrong cheesecake. I give it to her for remembering 3 out of the 4 that we ordered. It might&#39;ve helped if she wrote it down. It took forever to get 4 slices of cheesecake. Seriously should not take like half an hr for that... Then, we couldn&#39;t even tell her about her mistake because she never came to our table. It was impossible to get her attention. It was not that busy when we were there either. So finally, we get her attention and she takes it away (brand new, we didn&#39;t touch it). We got the correct order like 15 minutes later... and it was nasty. It was too sweet and none of us liked it, but we didn&#39;t want to send it back. Idk why people I&#39;m with don&#39;t like sending food back, but anyway!

4 slices for $40 is basically a rip off, but we still like to go here because sometimes it&#39;s good and we were really craving cheesecake.
 
I find that at this cheesecake factory, the service is always bad. Whether you spend $40 or $200... I get it that they&#39;re really busy sometimes, but you don&#39;t wanna feel like you&#39;re inconveniencing them by being there and that&#39;s how I&#39;ve felt twice so far. And this is spaced out like a year apart.

Idk I&#39;ll prob still go here when I crave cheesecake, but even those are a hit or miss. Some good, some not good at all. The same goes for the food. Maybe I&#39;ll just carry out my cheesecake next time or something."

My daughter was visiting and we have very different tastes for food sometimes. This place has a large and diverse menu, so we decided to go.

At 6pm on a Wednesday night it was crowded, but we were seated pretty quickly. The service was good. The food was okay - not particularly memorable. I had a burger, which was ordered medium-rare but served well-done. The meat was good, though. The fries, however, were terrible. They tasted like the oil had not been changed recently. I am really not a big eater but I generally finish what I was served. This time, I left the fries after eating only a few.

I struggled with how to rate my experience. I like going to Cheesecake Factories that I have been to in other cities. I have good experiences there. This particular one I have had run-ins with before when I did complain about the food. One time, the general manager even stepped in saying I was being unreasonable - I have a food allergy and when they disregarded that and served the meal wrong, he belittled it, refused to replace it and charged us anyway.

Place still gets packed and waiting area looks like we&#39;re a bunch to sardines, especially the weekend. They still have a pager system, wish they had a cellphone text system so you can walk around the mall but you can estimate how long your wait will be so time it well.
Once we got seated, we were treated by our server quickly very nice and attentive lady. She made sure our drinks were filled and our food is served in a timely manner. Even when the dessert was running behind she apologized to us but letting us know it&#39;s coming out soon.
We were given sweet honey oat and sour loaf bread at the table.  Both were good too tempting to ask for more.
Hubby got a beer and I got a drink cocktail, a pineapple Moscow mule. You can definitely taste the pineapple flavors with a half sliced fresh pineapple. It came with a very tall glass. I would get this again it&#39;s flavors are very tropical and sweet.
For my dish, I ordered the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta very good this is my favorite dish on the menu. Plenty of pasta some are veggie pasta and others are plain topped with a spicy jambalaya sauce chopped onions and bell peppers with plum tomatoes with a couple of whole shrimp and chunks of chicken breast. 
Hubby got his usual the shepherds pie dish. Well seasoned chunks of ground beef with a mixture of finely shredded Zucchini, carrot sticks and peas topped with the creamy mashed potatoes. Very hearty. Their portions here are plenty that you can take home unless you&#39;re very hungry then eat up my friend enjoy!
Both dishes came to us piping hot, excellent!
To end a great meal, we both shared a huge slice of dolche de leche cheesecake! It has a lighter texture than your typical cheesecake. It also came with two huge whip cream tops and with chopped nuts and toffee. Wow delish!

(We couldn&#39;t shop while we waited because the range wasn&#39;t far enough)

Anyway! Aside with my annoyance with the wait everything else was great! Our waiter Gareth, I believe was his name? Was awesome and he had a cool accent which my friend loved and he was very patient with my weird food requests which I&#39;m sure are annoying so thank you! He also went on break during our dinner so we had a fill in waitress for our table and she was very nice as well so we got lucky!

We had the Simosas to start and both my friends got the BLTs which were huge and I had the Mac and Cheese burger. My beef patty was a little more cooked than I wanted but still totally edible and not worth the fuss of sending it back. Their sweet potato fries are my favorite!

Good dinner and very friendly service. The only reason they&#39;re getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because I&#39;m a brat and don&#39;t like waiting that long, we got there at 6:45 and didn&#39;t leave till 9:30, I wish they took reservations because we knew 3 days ahead of time we&#39;d go there but otherwise everything was awesome. Get the cheesecake too obviously!!"

Their Oreo cheesecake and Godiva Cheesecake is absolutely to die for. I always come to the Cheesecake Factory for dessert with my friends.

I have been to Cheesecake Factories all over the US and this is one my favorites. Our server was more than attentive and made our much needed date afternoon go smoothly.  I ordered the Dynamite Shrimp to start with. It was ok. The shrimp were cut into small strips and battered with some of the tails still on. It was hard to tell which ends had the tails. 
I decided to try one of their loaded toast options. I went for the typical tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. The dish was a bruschetta on steroids and delicious to boot. We were too full to order cheesecake. I guess next time."

Most of the time I leave with a container to go. Friday&#39;s and weekends they are very busy I recommend coming early or you might have to wait. Holiday time is so crowded but that is to be expected. I recommend the Veggie Burger and the pasta dishes."

This was our first visit here and this location was no exception.  They also had Lagunitas IPA on draft, so bonus points for that.  Our dinner party had the following and it was all good.  I also pre-checked on my saltiness concern for their  jambalaya pasta and server/chef had it prepared with no additional salt on the shrimp and chicken (it was perfect!):

- Renee&#39;s chicken salad sandwich and soup
- Jambalaya pasta
- Chicken Bellagio
- Fried catfish

We also saved room for delectable slices of mango key lime and banana cream cheesecake.  Service as alluded to was good and attentive, and the place is actually and deceptively quite massive.  Reservations on the weekdays, but not weekends FYI."

First impression: it smells like garlic and fancy cheese. Not good for people with sensitive noses. The wait for our food was about half an hour, but that&#39;s pretty average considering this is a nicer restaurant. Our server was absolutely outstanding. Didn&#39;t catch her name, but she answered all our questions, smiled almost nonstop, and helped us decide on dessert. I ordered a Cuban sandwich (also a first for me) and it was really good! The only negative thing I have to say about that though is the bread was literally painful to bite into because it was toasted, thick, and super crunchy. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to order the Cuban again if the bread was softer. And omg those fries!!! Golden, delicious, fresh, and perfect with the ketchup they provided. I ordered the Black Out cake for dessert and took it home. Now that I&#39;ve dug into it as a midnight snack, omg... Chocolate lover&#39;s heaven. It does contain nuts on the outer part though so beware if you have a nut allergy. The entire visit for 4 people: 4 waters, 1 Coke, 1 lemonade, 4 entrees, and 4 slices of cheesecake/regular cake = $100+ tab. Overall, I was really impressed. Top notch service, absolutely tasty food, incredible dessert selection, beautiful interior design... I&#39;m sold."

I only ordered the red sangria when I was here today, but I&#39;ve been here plenty of times and never really had a complaint. If you prefer less saucy dishes then the skinnylicious menu is great!

I would&#39;ve appreciated it if she actually had a caring attitude, exhibited a concern, or had taken the price of the chicken off the bill. She didn&#39;t care, which makes the company look bad when it comes to customer service. I wasn&#39;t looking for anything free or complementary. Her attitude is what upset me and made me write this review.

You will wait for at least half an hour. Go shop at macys while you wait. It&#39;s right next door. The parking is available but if it&#39;s busy, you will park very very far. 

The restaurant is not as big as other cheesecake factories. The service is adequate and the food is the same as any other location. 

The bathrooms are fairly clean. All in all an average experience in a very busy area. Be ready to wait. So good thing is, by the time you get your table, you will be hungry enough to lick your plate clean.

There was a lot of energy and it was extra crowded. Unfortunately, they must have been short on staff and the bathroom was super unkept. I think it always reflects poorly on any restaurant when the bathroom is a mess! I was just stopping in to pickup cheesecake to go...and of course, it was fabulous as always. I will say that it seems that the pieces are smaller these days, but more expensive! I guess that&#39;s how it goes...just glad the quality is still good."

Then, you have the Cheesecake Factory, whose menu is about fifty pages long. As a result, they have many dishes that they do mediocre. 

The food is not bad, but it&#39;s not good either. As an example, we ordered a pizza from the kids&#39; menu for our son, and the crust was so soggy and undercooked that it disintegrated when he tried to pick up a slice. It&#39;s just average food--nothing special.

The service is also merely average. The bare minimum is done to get you what you need for your meal, although if you&#39;re there during lunch or dinner &#34;rushes&#34; be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes for your food once you order. In all honesty, the service is about the same as you would expect at a Denny&#39;s--simply average.

The total bill was around $50 for lunch for my wife, our son, and me. There are a lot of restaurants in Schaumburg where you can get better food and better service for less money."

Our bartender was as unfriendly of a person that I&#39;ve ever met. She probably said 10 words to us the entire time we were there. We both ordered things we had never tried (our 2nd mistake) both of our meals were not good at all. We got to leave because we paid with cash and left it on the bar.

After three consecutive years of bad experiences at Claim Jumper on Rt 59, we can&#39;t seem to settle on one place. We&#39;ve been on the lookout but   we continue to change locations year after year. That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing because we get to try new or less frequented restaurants as a family, annually.

The kids are still young (one of them still believes in Santa) so choosing a restaurant that accomodates kids&#39; taste in food without compromising the quality of service and ambiance that fits my sister and her husband&#39;s budget can be challenging.

Fortunately, the perimeter that covers our area for good eats is the Northwest Suburbs. It&#39;s a huge territory with a cornicopia of restaurants. It continues to develop and grow to rival with Chicago&#39;s best.

When we finally settled on The Cheesecake Factory, I was relieved and actually happy with the choice we made. My usual complaint that the menu has too much variety of dishes, accomodated all eight of us to find something satisfying: Angel hair pasta plates, red meat with a side, a turkey burger with a side,  seafood with a side and 2 baskets of warm loaves of white and brown bread served with room temperature butter.

Some of us started with an adult beverage, I had a Coke straight up with ice. The kids had iced water. 

After finishing our entrees, no one says they don&#39;t have room for dessert to share. I mean, the name of this restaurant is a dessert. Who disagrees with me that it would make sense to eat at a place famous for their dessert and skip ordering one?

The way they have the cheesecakes displayed, just off to the side of the hostess&#39; stand and set up like a retail shop with its own staff and cashiers, it&#39;s easy to just stop in, place an order for a slice and go!

By the way, thank you for listening to my first review. Of course I ordered the Strawberry cheesecake and I do have something to say:  upgrading the 3 measely strawberries to 3 ginormous ones was a fabulous idea. I&#39;m glad I, I mean you, thought about it first!"

We sat in a booth with a great view of Woodfield Mall. 

My husband was sad to find out from our server they no longer serve the wasabi crusted tuna. My husband loved that entree and was sad to see it go. Bring it back please?!  Instead he opted for the cod tacos served with rice and beans. He thought it was good, but not anything he would go rushing back here for. My standard order that I always get here the Chicken and Biscuits had a strong onion flavor to it. I don&#39;t mind onions, but it was a tad bit too much. 

For dessert we ordered the banana cream cheesecake served with fresh banana slices and whipped cream. DELICIOUS!!! 

Next time we&#39;re in the mood for Cheesecake Factory we&#39;re going to stick to the location closer to home in Lincolnshire."

It was the early afternoon so the restaurant was relatively empty. The host took us to a table all the way in the back. My sisters and I just looked at each other bc we all thought it was weird that he passed so many empty tables to sit us all the way at the last table in the rear of the restaurant. 

A waitress came and greeted us, and brought a round of waters back. 10mins go by and she hasn&#39;t returned yet. We see her coming back our way and we get her attention, we ask if we can order our appetizers now and she says &#34;I&#39;m not your waiter&#34; we say ............&#34;ok well can you get the person who&#39;ll be our waiter??? We&#39;ve been waiting for like 15mins and no one has came to our table.&#34; She says it was a change in shifts so she&#39;ll go get our new waiter. 15mins later our new waitress is at our table. 

Now we&#39;re just ready to eat so we order our entrées. My sister has her son with us so she asks if his food can be brought out as soon as it&#39;s done. I order a falafel salad. She orders a fried chicken sandwich and everyone else has some sort of pasta. My nephew&#39;s food arrives 20mins later along with his mothers food. 10mins later a pasta plate comes out. 15mins later my mom &amp; little sisters dish comes out. Everyone has their food except Me and all I had was a salad. 
The waitress asks &#34;oh did your salad come out?&#34; ....... Well of course it didn&#39;t I don&#39;t have it, I do t even have a plate in front of me. It&#39;s now been about 50mins and she finally comes back with my salad, which I&#39;m sure was just sitting back there waiting to get picked up. I took one bite of the falafel and it was not even crispy. I asked for it to be sent back and for management. 

The manger comes to our table and is actually the same person who sat us all the way in the back and gives me attitude. I told him about the long wait and how we&#39;ve been there for like 2hrs and everyone&#39;s food coming out one at a time and me receiving a salad an hour later that should&#39;ve  taken no time to come out. He says &#34;well I took it off the bill so you don&#39;t have to pay for it-it&#39;s off the bill&#34;"

1. We walked in and it was packed! We thought that it would be a good restaurant to eat at! They gave us a buzzer and it buzzed fairly quickly.

2. We sat down and ordered drinks straight away. No problem about that. So we finished our drinks and the waiter looked at us but did NOT come over to ask us if we wanted a refill. I was there with 3 people so 4 in all.

3. We ordered our appetizers and those came out quickly! That was the good part about it! We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the fried zucchini.

3. So, we ordered the entrées and I got the tomato and basil pasta with chicken. The chicken was dry, and the pasta wasn&#39;t even cooked all the way through. The Fettuccine Alfredo that another person ordered at my table was EXTREMELY watery and it was really garlicky. He did not like it at all.

4. To &#39;resolve&#39; the issue, we called the manager over to talk to us about how the food wasn&#39;t good at all. She took the Fettuccine Alfredo and the Salmon off of the bill. We wanted Cheesecake but we decided just to bolt out of that joint because of how bad it was.

I will give it another shot, but if they screw up I will never go back to that place. I gave this place 2 stars because the service was &#39;okay&#39; and the appetizers were delicious."

First while we were seated the table wasn&#39;t cleaned and the spoons and fork were dirty and we were suppose to eat with those? Then our waiter finally came by and I told him can he exchange it and he&#39;s like sure no problem. When he came back we ordered Pepsi or Cola what ever they had but without ice. The waiter comes back gives our drinks and while me and my gf took a sip I was like this ain&#39;t no cola but a mix of cola and MINERAL water and I noticed the different light color of the drink. It&#39;s prolly because we asked with no ice so that meant that would give the cola extra couple oz so they added water instead."

I prefer to not go here just because this mall is always so packed with people but we went here about 2 hours before they closed one night and it was pretty dead. It was also a Thursday night, so I&#39;m sure that made a difference. If you want to go to a Cheesecake Factory though and not want to pay for parking like the one in Streeterville, this is definitely the place to go! 

I always get the fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli and portobello mushrooms and I&#39;m always satisfied about halfway through the entree because it&#39;s such a huge portion. Their calamari is amazing. My husband orders something different everytime we go here from burgers to steak and he is always satisfied by the end of the meal. Their cheesecake here, just like any other Cheesecake Factory is to die for!"

I understand that weekends are busy but their wait times are ridiculous.  When we walked in,  I waited in line just to have my name put in on the waiting list.  When I walked up to the hostess,  she did not greet me so I had to say hello to her first. I informed her we were a party of five and she tapped the guy behind her and repeated what I said.  Then she turns back to me and with an attitude says that the wait is two and a half hours.  I asked her if they over estimate like other restaurants sometimes do.  She looked at me like I was stupid and didn&#39;t respond with actual words.  I told her thank you and that we would find different place.  She simply shrugged and moved on to the next person.  
I will never visit this location again if thats the kind of customer service they have."

Their carbonara pasta with chicken is awesome.  They give a very generous portion too.  The other item I&#39;ve ordered is the shrimp sandwich.  It was good but I kept wondering where the shrimp was.  For a shrimp sandwich it lacked its main ingediant and left a lot to desire and their prices are not cheap!

I have never had bad service here.  I have come for lunch around 12 and dinner around 5pm.  This was during the week so the mall wasn&#39;t as crowded.

Their cheesecake is a main standout.  Many different flavors for all tastebuds.  I&#39;ll be back again, but i&#39;ll stick to the weekdays as it seems to be crowded on the weekends.  

One thing that I like and I don&#39;t depending on how hungry I am is that their menu is almost 20 pages.  It is like reading a book so if you haven&#39;t been here before try looking at their menu online so your table doesn&#39;t spend 20 minutes trying to pick their meal."

My salmon and mashed potatoes were definitely sitting under the lamp, as well as my fiancé&#39;s food.

Its over priced bad tasting food...and almost $8 for a SLICE of cheesecake!! Honestly I use to like CF but after today&#39;s lunch visit. No thanks!! I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich. Fries weren&#39;t warm at all (although the plate was very hot...must have sat under the warming light too long) and no flavor at all. The sandwich was so greasy it was stomach churning. Our server had zero personality. Ill never ever go back. Eli&#39;s cheesecake is better anyway.

You&#39;ve been to the Cheesecake Factory, haven&#39;t you? It&#39;s great!

The only downside to this place is that the menu is so diverse, it will take you 30 minutes to decide!

My go-to dish is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Just the right amount of sweet and loaded with plenty of chicken and shrimp. As an appetizer, the Buffalo Blasts are a must.

The ambience is dark and loud, the service is top notch, food is delicious with large portions, and the wait times can get heavy because of the mall traffic.

If you haven&#39;t been here, definitely stop in. If you have been here, you should agree, it&#39;s one of the better Cheesecakes in the Chicago area."

I&#39;m not particularly sure why, though I&#39;m not a huge fan of cheesecake (unless it&#39;s ALL chocolate) but I realize cheesecake is only one part of their menu, which as we all know, is rather extensive.  I don&#39;t DISLIKE it, but after I stopped eating meat 6 and a half years ago, I was unable to eat what I usually would order which was the delicious &#34;crusted chicken romano&#34; or something like that.

I found myself out in Schaumburg for some reason last weekend and when lunchtime approached, somehow this was the selected venue.  I must have been in an especially agreeable mood.  While it appeared to be freakishly crowded in there, the wait for two was only 10 minutes, but I think we waited 15 or 20, still no big deal.    

I think the last time I was at one of these places (the one in Oak Brook maybe?) I ordered one of those flatbreads and it was good, but I don&#39;t find flatbreads to be too terribly exciting.  This time, I went for the veggie burger.  I&#39;ve had many a veggie burger in my day, some good, some bad, some downright awful.  It&#39;s always a gamble for me.  This one, as described in the menu, sounded rather intriguing.  This is what it said:  A Delicious &#34;Burger&#34; Made with Brown Rice, Farro, Couscous, Mushrooms, Black Beans &amp; Onion. Served on a Toasted Bun with Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion, Pickles &amp; Mayo. Served with a Green Salad.  I ordered it without mayo (because I think it&#39;s disgusting) and got it with fontina cheese.  

And whatever that brown bread is they serve, it&#39;s delicious, I love it, and I eat too much of it.  But if there&#39;s any treat in eating there, it&#39;s that.  

Our waiter kept apologizing to us for the wait.  It didn&#39;t feel like things were taking a long time, but I think we were there for about two hours.  I didn&#39;t care, but I asked for ketchup to douse my burger in and never got it so I ended up consuming it without.  It was still delicious, but would&#39;ve been even better with ketchup.

We got cheesecake to go (so full).  Hershey&#39;s chocolate for me, pumpkin for the other one.  

I&#39;m slightly more frugal now, so I always wince a little when the check comes because it&#39;s always more than I think it should be - and we didn&#39;t order appetizers or drinks.  

The only somewhat annoying thing that happened was that there were sooooooooooo many screaming babies and children there at the same time we were.  So I was hearing surround sound of crying pretty much the entire time.  The kid at the table behind us kept throwing things which of course ended up right at our table.  Was it bitchy of me to not pick anything up for the parents?  Well, I didn&#39;t.  It wouldn&#39;t have been sanitary."

started with a fair margarita while my sister-in-law opted for an odd but not unappealingly cucumbery cucumber lemonade thing.

nice basket o&#39; bread though. can&#39;t hardly find good bread in Iowa.

Sandra was quite pleased with her chicky-avacado salad while I struggled with the fish tacos. The main difficulty was ordering since I really wanted two each fried and grilled but had to get a complete set. The waiter seemed as puzzled as I about this and apologized for the inconvenience. (it seems the corporate shills&#39; ordering system is not capable of through-putting fish-bits in quantities less than four) Anyway, the grilled fish tacos were absolutely delicious, one lime halved to spritz them. hearty thick black beans and crazy green rice (cilantro lime?) sets up nicely for flavor/texture contrast.

finished with delightful regular cheesecake, while sandra had the lemoncello-layer cake thing. ladies at the next table were trying to gawk politely at the immensity of it all but we kinda noticed the saucer-eyed looks of desire. So I entertained them with my Uncle Donald&#39;s headstone adventure while waiting for our server to comeback with a big box o&#39; black breads for me to take back home (they almost made it too)"

I&#39;d rather just toasted bread. Thank god I didn&#39;t get fries, I just had a side Caesar which was good as always. I got the vanilla bean cheesecake to go and holy moly it is rich and sweet.

Classic american food with average price. The food at Cheesecake factory is not going to rock your world, but they have such a wide selection that you can find a dish for pretty much anyone. This makes for a great location when you are going out with a bunch of friends to eat. The portions are ample in size and you never leave feeling hungry. The cheesecake is nice, I can&#39;t say that it is better than Eli Cheesecake, but they have quite a large selection and the perfect way to end your meal. Servers are usually good and attentive and I have never had any issues at this location.

Pro- large american food menu, good customer service, cheesecake!

Con- although the cheesecake is great, for the slice of 2 you can buy an entire cheesecake at Eli cheesecake world....

I tried the avocado eggroll appetizer after seeing it pop up in many reviews. It tasted like guacamole stuffed inside a thick eggroll wrapper, not bad but not great. Tip: go easy with the dipping sauce! It is overwhelmingly sweet. I ordered the chicken stuffed tortillas, an enchilada type dish made with melted cheese and tomatillo sauce over four corn tortillas stuffed with (not very)spicy chicken. Also just mediocre. The pasta dishes seem to be consistently good. My friend ordered miso salmon which is served over rice. The salmon was good but the bed of rice it was served over was horribly undercooked. It says it comes with snow peas but it looked like the few snow peas that came with the dish was just for garnish. 

I hope to update this review after I&#39;ve tried more of their desserts, though! Can&#39;t really judge the Cheesecake Factory on just their entrees when I really haven&#39;t had a lot of their cheesecakes! To be continued..."

I&#39;m making prolonged eye contact hoping that you realize I am missing a plate and silverware, not because I find your eye make up intriguing. You have one soup of the day, please know what that that is when you start your shift.  Perhaps I&#39;m just holding too high of a standard but it gets frustrating.

As far as the menu goes, there are too many options for every category except soup. The chicken tortilla soup is amazing but they have it once a week, the fried mac n&#39; cheese is pretty good, so are the pastas and even the sandwiches. Nothing is really out of this world good, but it&#39;s a nice place. The cheesecake is delicious and they have a flavor for everyone. 

If you have people visiting from out of town its a good option in the suburbs.  Otherwise, head to a place in the city that has both a good atmosphere and non-generic food."

On a whim last night, I suggested my family and I go here to try it out. 

We were almost immediately seated, which was nice considering Woodfield is typically busy, even on week nights. I didn&#39;t realize how huge the restaurant was from the outside- holy crap! It&#39;s quite dim, which I love, and is fancier than I thought it would be. 

I wish I could remember our waiter&#39;s name because he was fabulous. It&#39;s as if he knew exactly how many times to come to the table, the perfect amount of wait time before refilling drinks, etc. The best service I have ever had at a restaurant! 

Now onto the food...ugh. Amazing. At first I was a little skeptical due to how huge the menu is and how many different cuisines they offer (Italian, Asian, Mexican, American, etc). I&#39;ve noticed that when a restaurant has too large of a menu, the food isn&#39;t always great. I ordered the avocado egg rolls to start, even though my family thought it was an odd appetizer. We were all surprised at not only how quickly the appetizer came, but how DELICIOUS the egg rolls were. The sauce is to-die-for. The &#34;black&#34; bread was great as well and the butter was warm. Seems stupid, but I hate when butter is cold and won&#39;t spread on your bread! 

I am a veggie burger junkie, and in my opinion, they&#39;re very easy to mess up. They&#39;re either flavorless and falling apart all over the place or perfect. Let me say, this one was perfect! It did fall apart a bit, but it didn&#39;t bother me at all because it was full of flavor. The dipping sauce that comes with it is fantastic too. I got sweet potato fries for the side, which I&#39;m also obsessed with, and they were amazing! Simple, but they complemented the burger very nicely. The proportions are also huge, seems to be a theme here! I think the cheesecake speaks for itself, but my favorites are the Oreo and lemon meringue. 

All in all, I plan on going back for my birthday in April. There are so many things I want to try, but the veggie burger was so good that I may just have to stick with that! Highly recommend."

Last visit, the burger was raw in the middle after ordering medium well. The Vietnamese spring rolls used to be great when they came as three whole spring rolls and what I looked forward to but aren&#39;t delicious anymore and are cut into many slices. I forgive this because there are so many items to order from and they are good about taking back unacceptable items which I have only down once with the raw burger.

Based on yelp reviews we tried the avocado eggrolls. They were good. They were not quite what I thought they would be based on the reviews. but they were still good enough. A bit mushy. I wish they had something crunchy in them. 

I had the chicken and biscuits as my main dish. This was really great. Everything I want in a dish. The mashed potatoes make the dish and they were some of the best I&#39;ve had. 

My mom tried the Mac and cheese burger. It has a deep fried Mac ball on top of it. She gave me a piece of the ball to try. that was amazing. the burger itself seemed a little underwhelming but she did say it was good. Fries were solid too. 

Well we had to get desert. I tried the red velvet cheesecake. Oh man. That was the highlight of my meal. Such a good taste and texture. I tend to be a peanut butter girl but this was a pleasant deviation. My mom had the chocolate truffle cake. The piece I tried was also delicious. Overall great meal! 

The restaurant itself is huge. The tables are kind of close together. The wait staff was fine. A little expensive but for a special occasion reasonable!"

Seated immediately, greeted upon being seated and welcomed by our waiter, George.  He put up with our tables incredible gift of gab, as we thumbed through the dictionary of deliciousness (menu). 
The bread and butter they serve (complimentary) hold a very special place in my heart- especially the honey wheat. And the warm and colorful ambiance is the perfect backdrop to great conversation and food.
It wasn&#39;t my first time here, it probably was close to the 200th time that I&#39;ve dined here. It was, however, the first time I&#39;ve ever ordered a glass of wine. The Pino noir was decadent and only $10.50 for a glass.
We shared the corn tamale cakes- which never cease to amaze. The sweet and warm coupled with the cool creaminess of the sour cream and avocado.... Infringes upon perfection.
I ordered the jerked pepper shrimp dish, which was super rich, very flavorful and the plantains on the side rounded out the dinner, quite nicely. My friend ordered the chicken Bellagio- which was a generous serving of tender chicken over pasta, with Parmesan cheese and arugula salad on top. Fresh and delicious.
Seeing as how we stuffed ourselves on the bread, tamale cakes and giant dinner portions, we didn&#39;t have room for dessert. So we reached down to our inner fat kids and ordered three slices to go.
Pineapple upside down cheesecake. 
Taking two phenomenal deserts and scientifically combining them to create an unbelievable treat sensation... How is this the first time I&#39;m trying it?!
I didn&#39;t share. In fact- I want another. 
From beginning to end, the entire meal was spot on. Way to always be a high scoring restaurant, and a favorite.

But seriously, if you go- pick up an extra slice of the pineapple upside down cheesecake for me."

Although I like the addition of the Skinny menu, I don&#39;t like that they have raised prices plus they got rid of the Portabella Burger which was my favorite thing on the menu.

The food is just meh, overpriced and honestly for the same price (or less!) you can have amazing food at Lincoln Whiskey Kitchen. The servers are just in a routine and not very happy to be there nor do they a passion for the food at Cheesecake Factory.

We headed out for a late dinner and arrived around 8:30.  Well the mall was packed still and plenty of people were waiting for tables. They gave us a buzzer and told us it would be 20 minutes so we went out into the hall to wait where it was much less crowded.  The wait was just as expected and not too bad. 

We had a table in the back and our server came right over once we were seated. The bread we were served was delicious.  I really enjoyed the whole wheat one.  Since we had waited 20 minutes to be seated, we both had the chance to look over the menu so we already knew what we wanted to order. We both ordered a drink also and I think our server might have gotten a bit distracted because there was a little delay in getting those.  Our food came out fairly quickly and my oh my the servings were large.  We had already agreed ahead of time that we were most definitely getting cheesecake, but that didn&#39;t stop my boyfriend from putting down his entire meal.  He still ate the cheesecake too.

The coupon is only good Monday-Wednesday. I went into this restaurant and they told me they&#39;re not accepting any coupons until Thursday, at which time the coupon would be invalid for four days and my family would leave. After talking to the manager they agreed to accept the coupon I paid for &#34;just this one time&#34;. If you didn&#39;t want to accept the coupons, why are you partnered with the website?

We then realized that this is the only Los Arcos with no lunch menu. We even called the Palatine location, which confirmed that the menus between the restaurants should be roughly the same, and yet prices were twice as expensive at this location because they chose to not use the lunch menu at all. At this point, we chose to leave - it wasn&#39;t worth overpaying and we were already put off by the restaurant&#39;s reluctance to accept the coupon. We went to Los Compadres down the street and were very satisfied.

I regularly eat here. For the suburbs, it&#39;s a pretty decent price. Taco dinner for $7.75 is a sweet deal. If your into more than just the regular asada tacos, I definitely recommend the cabeza tacos and the tripitas tacos (intestine tacos). NO FOUL SMELL OR GAMEY TASTE. I know some will think this way. But trust me, they are to die for (Order them crispy. They cook them 100%, but if you order them regular, they will be a bit chewy).

Their tortas are awesome. Their caldo de res (beef stew) is great as well. They&#39;re hot sauces, especially the guac salsa is very tasty! It is spicy. Actually spicer than the red sauce. They also specialize in seafood like the camarones a la diabla. I definitely recommend that or the coctel de camaron.

I haven&#39;t tried their alcoholic specialty drinks, but their pina colada in a coconut looks refreshing and tasty. Their horchata is always up to par. They have either tamarindo and melon juice is awesome. Fresh squeezed oj is great, but it is a tad expensive. That would be my only complaint.

Awesome tacos. Recommended this place to a colleague who moved to the area and her and her boyfriend now frequent this place routinely; as do I. Would recommend to a lot of people, even with the competing places in the area.  

Side note:  

Place has a sign called &#34;Mexican Food&#34; out front so don&#39;t get confused. It&#39;s right across the street from that sweet Lousiaina Chicken Popeyes joint. 

To the owners:

Consider a $1.25 taco day maybe on Wednesday. You could really get a lot of business from United Airlines once people get the word you have a dollar taco day.  Just put a bunch of fliers out and you will see an influx of customers.  You will set yourself apart, there is no other dollar taco days in the area."

This remarkably good place is located in a cramped strip mall by Busse &amp; Algonquin, surrounded by the usual laundry, cell phone shop, etc. Inside, we found a lot of the regular customers were Mexican families and working folks living in the area who were also Spanish-speaking. Luckily, the waitress knew English and offered us a nice menu of choices. I always use the steak burrito as my benchmark standard for a Mexican place and this one is very good. Addionally, my son loves their quesadillas."

I have never been a big veggie eater, especially not cold or on a sandwich, and in most places (I&#39;m looking at you, Subway) you will pay full price for a sub even when you&#39;re essentially just asking for meat, cheese, and bread.  Maybe that&#39;s ok, because veggie&#39;s aren&#39;t exactly expensive, but when the resulting sandwich is barely more than a snack, it&#39;s nowhere near worth it.

At Jimmy John&#39;s you can order a Slim, which is exactly what I want: bread, meat, cheese, and condiments, at a discounted price.  Hallelujah!  Oh, and I should mention that the ingredients are all great, and their potato chips are a crunchy must-have addition to your meal."

We sat at the lounge area at the bar and waited about 5 or 6 minutes to be noticed. Once we were finally noticed, our server gave us menus and was curious if we knew what we wanted to drink. I let him know that my friend and I have never been to this restaurant, so could he explain what they are known for and the layout of the establishment was. 

He gave some pointers on their specialty cocktails and signature apps a lot of people order, along with his personal favorites. My friend and I gave it some thought and ordered their TIKI RUMAKI - which is also GF - to share along with our dinner choices. I ordered a signature cocktail instead of a usual IPA I would order because I feel that their beer selection is cliche, considering the only 2 choices of IPA&#39;s were Rev IPA and Penrose IPA. 

I noticed that all of the servers have to hold these weird huge ipad looking devices and that&#39;s how they place all the orders of food and drink, along with paying your tab. WEIRD. I felt as if the servers don&#39;t really look at the customers unless the customers don&#39;t know what to order, then the servers have to stop staring at their screens to actually look at you to help you figure out what you should get...as if that doesn&#39;t already happen with most people with their cell phones....

I didn&#39;t really feel like taking my own little tour of Level 257 so just by glancing around they have a lounge area around the bar, a sit-down area for families to eat, bowling alleys on both sides of the venue, and then a little area for arcade games. I&#39;m not the nerdiness of nerds, however, after being here for 3 hours, I definitely won&#39;t be back to attempt to play games here. I&#39;d probably stick with Headquarters or Emporium. I get the vibes of a Dave &amp; Busters at Level 257. 

The most rememberable part of this experience was our server forgetting our dessert that we ordered more than once! So we scored TWO awesome desserts that evening for the price of one! ^.^ So happy that my friend and I didn&#39;t listen to what Miss Piggy says, &#34;Life is uncertain, eat dessert first&#34; because we probably wouldn&#39;t have gotten 2 desserts :)"

I thought the food and drink were just &#34;ok&#34;, nothing overly special. Might be fun with a group if you were enjoying the games and just planning to drink/snack- but there are certainly better options if you are just looking for a dinner out in the Schaumburg area."

So we came here with our friend Amy to see what was new since our last visit.

Low and behold is Level 257. No idea what it is, so we had to check it out. It&#39;s like a Lucky Strike. It&#39;s a bowling alley, restaurant, bar, and games, lots of games. Pac Man to be exact! Who doesn&#39;t love Pac Man?

We were lucky enough to walk in on the last day of free unlimited bowling. It had been going on in July and August, and extended until Labor Day. We just had to pay for bowling shoes which was $4. We were all about it. 

Bowling was so much fun. Super gigantic life size Pac Man games were even better. Loved this place. Drink and food options were a good amount too.

I wish I had this by me, but maybe in the future. Make sure to check this place out. It&#39;s so much fun and it&#39;s great for big groups."

No star for service, value, quality, and taste of food.  257 is located in Woodfield mall right next to Sears lower level.  This is a fancy bowling and arcade entertainment center with a nice bar and restaurant.  It&#39;s aesthetic and location are top notch.  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t say the same for their food.  I honestly didn&#39;t play any games so I will pass on judging that.... today. 

We came for happy hour which was a let down on it&#39;s own.  They had $2, $3, &amp; $4 well drinks, cheap wine, and beer.  No happy hour deals on food. We were seated right away and the host was efficient however our server was just ok, she could&#39;ve been helpful instead she looked like she didn&#39;t want to be there.  Since I wasn&#39;t dying of starvation, I ordered the BBQ pulled pork nachos.  It was tasteless and lacked BBQ and cheese which in my opinion makes a nacho entree! Ugh.  For dessert, we had the power pellets which were beignets filled with chocolate.  Delish and was the saving grace!

The menu was decent however pricey.  Service could&#39;ve been better.  I will definitely not return for the food but may give their game room a chance."

I got the Mushroom and Swiss burger for my main meal and it was actually pretty good. The plates are large, so we definitely needed doggie bags. They have a nice beer list and the bartender gave us one on the house. Yayy bartender, he was super nice.

There is plenty to do at Level 257. You can be a kid again with all the video games and arcade-y stuff they have at this place.

Level 257 addresses most of my problems that I have with the other such venues, and I enjoyed myself very much.  

It has a more adult atmosphere than the Gameworks, D&amp;B, or Kristof&#39;s; and isn&#39;t as garishly loud as Emporium.  Almost all of the other places have too many overlapping noises that make it hard to stay too long.  I don&#39;t mind a crowd, or music, but the other places often have different overlapping music between the restaurant, bar, and different sections.  They often have their games attract modes set too loud, or the carnival games make too much noise.  Level 257 had one soundtrack throughout the venue, and the attract modes of their games weren&#39;t too loud.  

Gameworks&#39; and Kristof&#39;s machines aren&#39;t always in the best condition, with some machines having poorly calibrated controls, worn out CRTs, and lower-quality LCDs.  Level 257&#39;s games are all in excellent condition, and their pinball machines all seem meticulously maintained.  The bowling alley looked to be in great condition as well.  The game selection isn&#39;t as good as a dedicated arcade, like Galloping Ghost.  Level 257 probably has the fewest arcade games of the bunch, since it&#39;s exclusively Namco games, but it has one of the better pinball selections.  If you&#39;re going exclusively for the games, then one of the other venues would be better, but I think Level 257 is the nicest for the whole games/bowling/food/drinks/hangout package.

Of all the other entertainment venues I&#39;ve been to, Level 257 has the best quality food and drinks.  They are a little bit more expensive than Kristof&#39;s, but about the same price as everyone else - but often much better in quality and variety of options.  D&amp;B has a great drink and cocktail selection, and good appetizers; Level 257&#39;s entrees are much better and their appetizers are still excellent.  Service late at night was very good, though I imagine it can probably get a little crazy during peak hours. 

While each of the other entertainment venues have their merits, Level 257 has become my new favorite by a fair margin.  It&#39;s not the kind of place I would go to all the time; however, if I had to go to a party venue like this, Level 257 would be my pick."

It seems like a good venue for such an occasion and their food is pretty good. 

Level 257 has soooo many stairs to get to the second floor where everything happens. I went with a coworker to check out the venue and she had some issues making the hike. They do have an elevator if needed but I can imagine it being a little difficult to maneuver down after a few drinkskis.

Upon arriving upstairs, Level 257 seems pretty cool. There are a few Pac-Man bowling bowls but overall there isn&#39;t a ton of Pac-Man or 80s themeing. I know they are trying to go for a more mature, adult vibe here but a bit more of the adorable little yellow guy thrown in wouldn&#39;t hurt. Arcade games are apparently on an hourly play basis with a good variety and the air hockey looks awesome! They also offer a bowling option but from all I understand it&#39;s a bit more manual in process than you may be used to.

Food is a bit pricey here but everything I&#39;ve had has been good. They also have a solid beer list and even offer beer flights which makes me smile ear to ear!

What I&#39;ve tried...
Bacon Wrapped Dates - Pretty darn good as far as these little guys go. I really enjoyed this appetizer!
Chicago CBS - Grilled Chicken sandwich that made me feel like I was ordering healthy as long as you overlook the slathering of cheese and bacon on top. Really enjoyed this sandwich though! Their semi-curly, super-thick, interestingly ridged fries are delicious, too! 
Quesadilla Sushi - Inventive and really cute! It&#39;s a quesadilla in a tightly packed roll but made to look like a sushi roll, presented just beautifully. I thought the taste was on point! 
Baby spinach &amp; bleu cheese salad - Skip this. It&#39;s exactly what it says it is but truly isn&#39;t anything amazing.

Service is the sticking point for me at Level 257. One time I went it was overly attentive with the server over every 2 seconds asking how we were, how each bite of each dish was, and just generally kind of creeping us out. One time I went we waited 30 minutes to order and had little to no service making us go well over our lunch hour. Call me Goldilocks because I want it just right in terms of service.

Overall I think Level 257 has great potential just needs to tweak a few things to keep their doors open - lower prices ever so slightly and step up service. I&#39;ll definitely come back to try again and standby that I think it could be a great venue for a work holiday party."

Food, alcohol, bowling, video games, and Pac-Man.  It is unfortunate the execution fell through horribly.  We came as part of a large group for a fundraiser; the positive point of the visit were the super-comfortable plush booths.  Besides that, it was mostly failure.  Let me break it down:

Service: One person took the order for drinks, another brings the alcoholic beverages to the table, a myriad of others ran the food out, and one person seemed to only refill the water glasses.  We had the hardest time managing to get someone to bring a diet Coke to the table.  It took twenty minutes for that, after numerous pleas to various staff members.  Then our server went completely missing, and a member of our party had to call the restaurant to find our server for us.  Of course, we then received a shit-ton of attitude for the rest of the night,  Yes, we of course still tipped, but since you pay your tab on the servers tablet, we even go major eye-roll and mumbling from our very lax yet dramatic waiter.  This was quite possibly one of the worst service encounters in recent memory.

Food and Drink:  Lots of craft brews, which was good; specialty cocktails were strong and fairly priced.  I did enjoy my Moscow Mule.  The food was a mixed bag.  The menu was a bit creative, but all over the place, with no apparent theme. We had fried calamari and about three sushi rolls to split.  The calamari was great, crispy with a hint of salt and pepper.  The marinara on the side clearly came from a can and was not even warm.  Sushi was OK.  I didn&#39;t expect anything special, and that&#39;s exactly what I got.

Can&#39;t say much about the bowling or games, since we spent most of our time playing &#34;Hunt for the Missing Server.&#34;"

I have actually been wanting to try this place out for quite awhile since I am a huge gamer and I have the utmost respect for retro. However, the fact that I despise going anywhere near Woodfield Mall has managed to keep me away. Woodfield is a mall that, even on a good day, is a monumental cluster F. During the Christmas season? My God, you would think they were giving away free beer and lap dances in the place from all the people. Also, be prepared for your GPS to go haywire if you have never been here before and are using nav. Mine was attempting to send me straight into a brick wall next to a loading dock on the entire opposite side of the mall from 257. I thought it was just me, but as soon as I got inside all the other people I was with reported similar issues. 

You can enter 257 either through the mall itself or from the parking lot. On the bottom floor is gift shop that has inventory similar to what you would find at Think Geek. I scored a PacMan mousepad for my desk at the office. The restaurant itself is located up a double tiered staircase (or elevator) to the second floor hostess stand. 257 was hosting our company X-mas party, so we had an entire wing and open bar all to ourselves. Ahhhhh, &#34;open bar&#34;! There are few two word combinations in history of the English language with such delightful connotations. People in the advertising buiz generally drink like fish. 

As for the games, they have tons of old school favorites in restored cabinets like Pac Man, Joust, Dig-Dug, Q-Bert, etc. Granted that it is not difficult to find an emulator if you just want to play these types of games, but getting the opportunity to actually play them on the original hardware is always a treat for us nerds. I was really hoping they would have a Neo-Geo MVS cart machine, as these are a blast for old school games like Samurai Showdown, Metal Slug, etc. but no such luck. I never got an opportunity to try out the bowling as I was too busy checking out games, drinking and talking shop with everyone, but others certainly seemed to enjoy it. 

Food wise I was not really expecting much from 257 given it&#39;s theme. I was counting on maybe TGI Friday&#39;s type of food at best,  but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. We got tray after tray of several different types of sushi, cheese and meat, sliders, pasta, etc. It was friggin fantastic for buffet food. I was taken aback. 

Service was also on point and extremely pleasant. They were continually clearing dirty dishes and glassware and had new food out rapidly. Having a huge group is always a challenging endeavor for any restaurant, but they handled it great! 

This is yet another occasion where I wish Yelp allowed the use of half stars as 257 was a solid 4.5 with a bullet in my book. If you have a friend or significant other who is a nerd, this place is a must visit."

Level 257 is located on the second floor and is an arcade/bowling alley. Walk in and find the &#34;dining&#34; and bar area in the middle. From here there are bowling lanes on both the left and right sides. There were about 6-8 lanes on each side. Lane seating is not traditional as you have tall chairs, tables, and booths. 257 is like a Pinstripes or classier Dave and Busters like bowling alley. I can&#39;t comment on the game selection as I did not play.

The bowling experience was average. They do not have the traditional scoreboards. They have touchscreen portrait LCDs that display your name and team members scores. The format is strange as you can&#39;t see your overall summary and only the person bowling at the moment can see their last 2 or 3 frame results. There were no mid-bowl animations, no display of pin placement, nothing. 

The lane setup was kind of tight. For a lane that had 8 people bowling and many others watching, there was not enough space for people to walk through or sit down at the tall tables. We were cramped and it was awkward at times trying to get by people. The lanes were your average lanes but there was a strange error that kept occurring where bowling balls would just fall off of the &#39;tray&#39; where they normally sit. It actually fell on someones foot while we were bowling and balls rolled across to other lanes from time to time.

Overall, 257 is just a middle of the pack place when comparing it to a Gameworks or a Pinstripes. Not fancy enough to hold their own with a top of the line corporate experience."

I&#39;m not a coffee drinker, but they have a special, cold-brewed coffee that takes hours to filter and is supposed to be awesome.  The salads, cooked sushi, and pasta dishes are fantastic, but the chocolate-filled poppers truly are my favorites.  If you&#39;re just having a burger or sandwich at Level 257, you&#39;re missing a five-star restaurant experience.  

The games and bowling are fun, but the gourmet food is what raises Level 257 to an entirely different class from Dave &amp; Buster&#39;s or Gameworks.  Schaumburg is pretty far away for us, or we would be eating at Level 257 all the time."

Groups of customers will be waiting and staff is more concerned with their own conversations to attend. 

Paid $12 for an 8oz JACK AND COKE!! RIP OFF!!!! Food looks good, but does NOT live up to the reviews. Pizza is under cooked, and everything else is chewy and bland. The game cards are charged per minute so as soon as you swipe, you&#39;re on the clock. Overpriced as well. The decor and atmosphere of this place is confusing. Is it classy, is it an arcade, is it a bar? 

Definitely NOT a place for children, but the advertising (gift shop, outside decor, and gaming idea) says otherwise. What are they trying to do here? There&#39;s no entrance to the mall, which is extremely inconvenient if you just want to get a snack and shop or something. 

Bowling: Again, Overpriced, and breaks down entirely too often to call themselves a bowling place. Just seems like they slapped a bunch of ideas together to create this mess of a place. But if overpriced food, drinks, and arcade games are your thing, then by all means, head on in to 257."

We walk in and go to the bar in the restaurant area. We stand at the bar. Waiting, waiting...waiting. While two bartenders are standing together counting their tips and talking to who I assume is a customer where some plates were opposite them on the bar. When one FINALLY comes over to us, my friend asks to order a drink and the bartender almost scoffs and says the bar is closed but their other bar is open until 1. 

Seriously? No one could have mentioned that as we passed the host stand going to that bar. Or one of the two bartenders couldn&#39;t have come over right away to let us know? A group of 5 people standing waiting. 

So we go past the host stand to go to the other bar - which is where the girl I thought was a customer at the bar - apparently a host (and 3 other people, one of which looked like a manager) were standing and let them know they may want to let people know that as they are walking in. They didn&#39;t even seem to know that bar wasn&#39;t serving drinks - and the guy that looked like a manager didn&#39;t say a single word. We decided to leave and go to another bar in the area.

I came here with my husband and his best friend, two 30 something geeks. The crowd was mostly people our age and a bit older, and a lot of families. Lot of birthday parties too. 

We wandered around a few minutes, checking the place out, then sat for dinner. We were at a high top in a bar area, honestly not the most comfortable spot and with three of us a bit tight on table space. But we managed. 

Here&#39;s what I liked: food was good. (Chips and queso to start, two burgers and a turkey banh mi, two fries and a side salad - all tasty.) Service was solid, with plenty of refills and plate-clearing happening. I like the atmosphere even though it was a bit loud (no sound dampening happening), the spaces are pretty comfortable and you could just as easily sit with a drink or run around playing games. The decor is nice and it&#39;s a bit on the upscale side without being stuffy. 

Awkward bits: our waiter was a little pushy about wine, started listing off options before we&#39;d even asked, and stood close by as we entered our tips (bill is run on a tablet, so I&#39;m sure they&#39;re making sure you don&#39;t screw anything up, but it&#39;s still a mite awkward). The high top tables are not great for a full dinner. 

And it is a bit pricey. They have things like steak frites and fancy pasta dishes which are more fine dining than you&#39;d expect while watching a giant Pacman face off in a noisy mall restaurant. You could easily spend $50 or more a person if you get drinks, apps, or dessert along with your meal. Of course, most things at Woodfield are $$, and it&#39;s a unique experience overall. 

All that said, it&#39;s a fun experience, and I&#39;d go back, knowing what&#39;s what."

I don&#39;t know if they are trying to be like a D&amp;B or gameworks place but they obviously have far fewer games. Essentially it is a dressed up, upscale, version of one of those places with a lifted price tag and pac man theme.

With all the thrills and frills that Pacman and his lady, Mrs. Pacman, have to offer, I was left with some ambivalence towards Level 257 after having attended this 80&#39;s-inspired, chic adult lounge for a private event.  Before attending this event I was like, totally psyched to check it out and to be honest I&#39;m really glad that I was able to check it out.  With that being said, however, if I&#39;d gone to Level 257 and had to pay for the food and the games I probably wouldn&#39;t have had as good of a time as I did at the event.  I only say this because the food and beer, although pretty good for the appetizers that they were, seemed a little costly.  if the cost isn&#39;t really a concern for you, though, then you&#39;d probably enjoy the food that&#39;s offered.  Granted, I didn&#39;t get to try any of their entrees, but I was able to have some of their arancini, vegetable dumplings, pork sliders and regular sliders.  All of these were very good and I couldn&#39;t stop swiping them as they came out of the kitchen.  I wish that Level 257 would have had more of a beer selection to wash down those appetizers though.  For as large as Level 257 is and for the lounge that it claims to be I&#39;d have thought there would be more of a beer selection so that was a bit disappointing.  I think, though, that what they lack in beer they make up for in the selection of specialty cocktails, all of which looked pretty good.

Although the food and beverages may be delightful and all, its the bowling and arcade games that are the main attraction (at least that&#39;s how I feel).  There&#39;s about 12 or so lanes for bowling - about 6 on each side of the lounge and bar area - and there&#39;s an entire area dedicated just to playing those beloved arcade games, both new and old.  The arcade area isn&#39;t actually that big, though, and I would have thought this arcade area would be bigger given the enormous size of Level 257.  They have the basketball hoop games, leap frog, race car games, pacman (of course) and several others but unlike other arcade games, you don&#39;t get any sort of &#34;reward&#34; (i.e. tickets for the purchasing items, etc).  I understand that this is an &#34;adult lounge&#34; so it&#39;s not a typical arcade, but a neat idea might be to make it where any accumulated points from the games could add up to getting a free cocktail or something.  It&#39;s just an idea; it could work because you buy time (i.e. 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc) of game play.

Now that I&#39;ve covered the essentials for you I should also mention that the service is pretty good and all of the waiters I came in contact with were pretty amicable so I can&#39;t say anything that would slight the service we received there.  It seems that these waiters and waitresses were pretty used to serving large parties (as this is what the venue is probably used for the most) so you can rest assured that they won&#39;t be running around like chickens with their heads cut off when a huge party comes in.  

Overall, I&#39;m super glad that I was able to come her and experience everything that Level 257 had to offer, but it was kind of like a one hit wonder for me...just like all those songs from the 80&#39;s."

The lanes don&#39;t seem level, the ball almost always curved (no I&#39;m not just a bad bowler lol) also the ball return is dangerous. It hardly slows the ball down before coming back - which is the result of my finger injury. I would not recommend letting kids bowl here for this reason. Good service and staff but I wouldn&#39;t come here for bowling."

I just went with a burger but the kids menu was pretty solid. I&#39;ll be back and maybe more adventurous with the menu. 

*** UPDATE - Place was great. Then they changed the game cards to dollar amounts instead of time. The kids go through $40 in 20 minutes. This takes an already expensive night to a night we will not afford. This place got greedy."

It&#39;s the suburbs and there aren&#39;t many things to do, so kudos to Level 257 for operating a venue that allows for some entertainment. 

This place offers arcade games, board games, ping pong tables, bowling lanes, and of course food. The arcade is okay. The ping pong tables are free so that&#39;s a plus. The board games aren&#39;t that great. And the bowling lanes, though shiny and seemingly nice, are terrible! The tables for each lane are nice and the bowling set up screen is interesting. The bowling shoes available for rent seem newish, which is a winner. However, the lanes are not oiled correctly, are very cramped, and the furthest lane is way too close to the arcade and can be a hazard to kids that run around there. In addition, service is very spotty when ordering food/drinks."

They offered free bowling and arcade games, so I knew the place would be pretty packed. Free stuff draws out the crowds. We did show up to the venue about 20 minutes early, but even at that time the wait for bowling was already 2-3 hours long. Since we had no intention of staying that long, we moved on. We did get to play some pinball, which was fun but I felt bad playing for more than a few minutes since the lines quickly formed. The event was kid and adult friendly.

Overall, the space is pretty cool. There&#39;s lots to do a la Pinstripes or any of these fun gaming/dinner places that are popping up in the area. All the servers and staff here were incredibly nice and even though they were busy, we had an enjoyable time. I think my favorite part was the little gallery downstairs of all the Pacman art.

The food and drinks are ridiculously overpriced. I do understand being at this kind of establishment, you&#39;re going to spend more. However, two cocktails cost me $26 (we&#39;d gone to another place earlier that night and got 2 appetizers and two drinks for $32.) Just based on that alone, I&#39;d never drink here, therefore probably never come back in the future unless there was another special event."

Bowling is free this July, you just pay for shoes ($4). We went on a Tuesday for lunch. Two moms, four kids and we automatically got two hours of free bowling. We bowled our full time and ate in between frames. The lanes are cool, over the top ball returns were fun for the kids, plus they easily set up bumpers for the kiddos. The food was good too. I got the CBT: a chicken sandwich on a brioche bun with avocado, bacon and all the fixings and a half spinach salad. The sandwich was awesome, I would totally recommend it. The salad was really blah. Lots of spinach but not enough toppings. My friend got the farmhouse burger, she loved it, with the wedge salad. The lunch combos are $10, her salad may have been an up charge, but I tried it, and it was worth it...very tasty with the unusual topping of avocado too. 
Her kids all got pizza, one gluten free, and they all ate about half. The pizzas are big for a kid; they looked good too. My son got the chicken fingers which he enjoyed but he didn&#39;t touch his fries. They are thick, potatoey and seasoned. I made sure they didn&#39;t go to waste ;-),but warning they aren&#39;t super kid friendly. 
After we bowled, the kids played games for 30 minutes, which cost $15. They charge by time and then you have unlimited games during that period. I loved that. My friend and I got time to talk and the kids loved all the games; some old-fashioned pinball machines and plenty of modern games too. 
I had a full and fun afternoon. Please go, I&#39;d hate for this place to close. It wasn&#39;t busy at all, but it should be."

Met up with a group there recently. It had a really nice upscale/grown up feel. Didn&#39;t seem to game roomy (if thats a word) But nonetheless was pretty decent. Drink menu &amp; wine menu was very extensive. Which was a plus! Only tried a couple of appetizers. They were okay for the price.

The gift shop is on your left when you walk in. It has a lot of neat toys that will be on any nerds priority list. I didn&#39;t find the prices outrageous and I would have totally purchased the pac man umbrella if t didn&#39;t have the restaurant logo so boldly plastered on it. I want to keep dry, not give your free advertising and I will get to that in detail shortly. 

We made a reservation and were seated promptly. That was great. The service was quick and he was super polite, I don&#39;t recall his name but he was sporting some awesome facial hair! You rock dude! They hard a martini special where if you purchase a martini you get a free 30 minute game card ... Great idea! We ordered two key lime martinis.  While the martini was delicious it was so small, and super expensive. No wonder you get free game play for purchasing one!

The food we each ordered the lobster mac and cheese which was almost heavenly. Super creamy and wonderful texture on the palate, but it was $21 for a small one serving plate. Don&#39;t get me wrong I enjoyed it and I will pay $21 for Mac and cheese one time in my life, but only once. When you go to fine dining Italian restaurants you order broccoli shrimp Alfredo for the same price and you eat for three days! So ya try the &#34;pasta&#34; once. I will come back for the lime coconut wings some day but I will get them to go. $100 with tip for two pastas, two tiny tiny green martinis, a coors, and a sprite, but don&#39;t worry because sparkling water is free. They spend lots of money on their water filtration ... Must be why it is $10 for a martini. Chug that water folks ... Should have asked for lemon with it to add some class to our table. 

Ambiance is suppose to be high end but I don&#39;t see why because it is like game works, with more expensive food, slightly better lighting, and well dressed servers. It is nice looking but the theme is pac man, and I didn&#39;t see any nerdy things until I left the dinner table. 

The games were fun especially the giant 4 player pac man screen. It also has several pin ball games and some classic arcade games. Along with a wall o pac man stuff! It also has bowling ... Check out the old bowling bags and shoes on the wall ... Don&#39;t worry the shoes don&#39;t stink! 

The bathroom is very modern, no hand dryer or paper towels, instead there is a rack of individually rolled white towels. I like this idea! Need to add it to my bathroom stat!

A great one time experience for the pac man lover or a bunch of 20 years old hipsters who think they can handle old school Atari."

This is a large arcade and bowling area - it is probably best suited for adults meeting for some fun but families can certainly make it work. We went for an event and found the food to be very good and the arcade to be a blast.

I found arcade games that I had not seen since my teenage years - Space Invaders, Galaga, Asteroids, Centipede, etc. So many retro games make this place unique and rare. Add the fact that they have a full bowling alley next to it all and this place is a destination I will go to again and again. Our son, who is age 11, was not in this event but he is anxious for us to take him here so he can play.

The access to this place is outside - exit the Sears first floor near Rainforest Cafe and you will see the doors for their place. Enter and then head upstairs. The overall decor here is a nice but not fancy; there are several areas to sit and do what you prefer. The staff was awesome and we really enjoyed our time here."

When I heard there was a new Pac-Man themed restaurant at Woodfield I was picturing a really kid oriented type atmosphere for the restaurant, something on the level of Rainforest Cafe. Instead, I was actually surprised to see how trendy and upscale most of it was. 

Atmosphere: The space itself was pretty huge and has several different sections with completely different vibes. On one side you have the bowling lanes, then right next to that is a bar/lounge type area with a bunch of couches where you can just drink and chill out. Next to the bowling lanes was an area with a fireplace and some couches where people can sit down and play some old school board games or read a book. In the middle of the room is the dining area. There was a wall full of wine bottles, and they were generally going for that higher end yet casual dining experience. In another area there was sports bar type setting that just had some long communal tables, some of which had a Pac-Man console built right into it. 

Finally, the entire back area was the gaming area where they had a mix of arcade machines (obviously with many Pac-Man machines) and traditional arcade entertainment like basketball, air hockey, etc. We happened to go on the 35th anniversary so all the games were in free play mode. But I heard that on a normal day instead of a credit based system they use a time based system which seems like it would make people rush instead of taking their time and enjoying everything. Overall, it&#39;s hard to describe what type of place Level 257 is since it&#39;s a mash up of so many different things. 

Food: I was really surprised to see that the menu wasn&#39;t just burgers, hot dogs, and pizza. It wasn&#39;t even just normal bar food either. The menu was striving for a higher end menu featuring steaks, seafood, pastas and unique appetizers. The restaurant was the one element that seemed to stray the most away from the Pac-Man / retro gaming theme. 

Meatballs - This came with 3 decent sized meatballs and a bunch of slices of bread. The meat was a bit dry and wasn&#39;t that tender. The sauce wasn&#39;t really spicy at all like it said on the menu, but the focaccia was soft and paired great with the sauce. It was still tasty, just nothing special. 

Nachos - The cheese was surprisingly good. It was a bowl of liquid cheese instead of just shredded cheese that was melted on top of the chips. The cheese sauce had a good flavor with a slight kick to it too. I just wish there were more chips. 

Bacon Apple Pork Chop - It was a pretty big double-cut chop, but the meat was a little on the tough side and was slightly hard to cut. The flavor was there, but it just didn&#39;t have the texture and juiciness I wanted. I did like the sweet and salty flavor combination going on in this dish though. The bourbon/apple reduction mixed with the bacon pieces created almost like a candied bacon flavor. It also came with some scalloped potatoes and some greens that balanced out the sweetness of the sauce.

I also saw that they&#39;re trying to be a trendsetter by taking all the orders on a tablet instead of writing them down, but it was a bit awkward when you have to calculate the bill including the tip right in front of the server. 

Overall, Level 257 is a cool place that offers something for everyone of all ages. I had a pretty good time on the 35th anniversary since all the games were free and it was more of a laid back atmosphere like Headquarters where you can just walk around with a beer and check out different games here and there. The food was ok, but there are probably a lot better options in the area within the same price range."

As a grown up I planed my birthday celebration with a few weeks of planing. I thought it would be fun for up scale bowling and games. I called saying I was having a birthday of 15-25 people and would like to book lanes. I was informed that they only take reservations 48 hours in advance. I then Asked if there looked like there was going to be any issue with my selected date and time (A Saturday at 7). They informed me there would be no issue what so ever. SO I called 2 days before. It was early after noon and I was told I was still too early for booking for Saturday evening but again was told I would have no issues.

When I called to reserve my lanes I was informed that they were completely booked with contract events and they take priority. At no point did anyone bother looking up to see if there would be availability despite me asking multiple times.

The manager on duty acted like it was no big deal and never even apologized for messing up the plans I had made weeks ago. I asked to speaker with there boss and was told they would have a GM call me with in the hour.  When I received a call i assumed I was speaking with the GM and was even less impressed with this conversation of constantly saying it was corporate policy and not their fault. When I commented about a GM should have better customer service skills Andrew told me he was not a GM. I apologized saying that I was expecting a GM  to call me so you could see my confusion. He told me he&#39;d have the GM call me.

When I received my next call I started by asking if he was the GM which Bob was. If I hadn&#39;t had so my negative experiences leading up to this conversation may have run a little different. I was still told there was nothing they could do for the date in question. and then he told me I could be scheduled for Sunday afternoon. At which point I reminded him that as adult most people need more than 48 hours notice for scheduling. I felt that Bob should have start by acting sorry offering solutions instead saying it wasn&#39;t their fault and nothing they could do and what do you want me to do. At this point all I wanted to hear was how they plan on resolving this issue so that other wouldn&#39;t have to go through the same issue."

They do have bowling which is unique and a giant pacman screen to play and watch while you eat. They do have a solid beer selection and drink list. The bar area has a few tv screens to catch a game. 

Food is decent but nothing special. Queso dip was a bit cold and cheese was fairly chunky. Buffalo wings were on point but slightly over fried (comes with dressing, celery and carrots). The meatballs aren&#39;t bad but nothing to get excited about as the marinara was fairly bland. The bacon wrapped dates were perfectly cooked and who doesn&#39;t like bacon!

I did enjoy the wood fire pizza. I had the mushroom and pepperoni pizza which was definitely on point and finished off with a nice crunch (added jalapeños for a little kick). 

I probably won&#39;t be coming back unless I am forced too. Gameworks around the corner at Streets of Woodfield is a far better option and much more reasonably priced for what you get."

One: food and drink is on the pricey side for a place that is essentially an alternative to Game Works around the corner.

Two: For a themed place that is named after Pac Man their lack of theme plastered everywhere is kind lame. I get they were going for tasteful levels of the theme, but c&#39;mon. I want to feel like I&#39;m at a place that gets me into playing the classics again. 

Now the good part was, although pricey, the food was good. The service was absolutely great. The servers and managers were super friendly and asked you how your food was, apologizing if anything came out late. 

Gaming area was on-par with expectations. There was a giant 4-player Pac Man, classic arcades, pinball and free board games area. Worth an evening out, but don&#39;t expect a deal on date night."

They have bowling alleys and an arcade with some of my old favorites.  I played tempest for about a half an hour and started realize just how addicting this game can be.  It had been over thirty years since I last played it.

The restaurant was clean, modern, comfortable, and had a great fun energy. The arcade, gift shop and retro stuff made everyone smile.   

The food was MUCH better than expected.  It&#39;s was excellent. There were some complex meals for the adults, but also things for my picky 13 year old (who needs food to be very conservative).  We all cleaned our plates and agreed to come back as soon as we can. I also appreciated all of the fresh, locally acquired foods made by hand right there in the kitchen.  Great job!

Our server&#39;s name was Elyessa.  BEST. SERVER. EVER.  Give that woman a raise!   She really added to the enjoyment of the day. 

Only non-positive was the price.  The price was reasonable and fair and I have no complaints.  Its not a negative, but not a great value either - just fair.

Overall, all four people loved it.  Will definitely be back.

Went up to the bar and bartenders seem preoccupied with each other rather than with guests that were sitting at the bar. Bar wasn&#39;t even busy, there were 3 servers, but how hard could it be to pour a beer? ...That will be the last time I assume that. The other time I went up to the bar for a drink, again, wasn&#39;t busy.

They combined two high-top, rectangular tables and seated us near the stairs/bowling area. The seating arrangement made it a bit difficult for us to all chat. 

The waitress was very nice and helpful. Everyone enjoyed their food, and we all tried a variety of items (pizza, pasta, salad, etc). A few of us also had dessert, which was very good.

The gaming was disappointing. You have to purchase game time by the minute. One of my friends isn&#39;t big into videogames, so we played air hockey and ping pong. Unfortunately, that&#39;s all we really got to do in our 30 minutes of purchased time because the ping pong was managed quite poorly. There is a room next to the table where employees work, so we asked how to begin a game of ping pong. They instructed us to swipe our cards and that the light on the table would trigger them to bring us the ball and paddles. We swiped our cards and waited a good give minutes. Then we went back and asked if they were going to bring us the stuff, and they finally did... another five minutes later. After that there was no way to stop the ping pong game and move onto something else (if we tried swiping on some other game, the game rejected us saying our card was in use elsewhere). 

Overall, food is good, bartenders are nice. If you&#39;re looking to game, go to Gameworks where the selection and game play is managed better."

I arrived before my date so the gift shop was a nice way to kill time. I also went over and tried to play the Pacman game in the lobby but soon realized it&#39;s just to view haha
The restaurant itself is upstairs. There is an elevator if you need it. You can&#39;t enter the restaurant from the mall so it&#39;s stairs or the elevator to get up there.

The atmosphere was pretty cool, I saw the bowling first and then the restaurant part. I had made reservations so we were seated right away. Our waiter David was very polite and knew the menu well.

Food was delicious! We were happy with all of our choices!

It took a little longer to get our check at the end. It was getting busier as the night went on so it&#39;s understandable but we were sitting there for a while. Our waiter explained the game system well and how to pay for it, even I wasn&#39;t confused!

We were definitely going to the game room that we heard about! I&#39;ve seen other people say it&#39;s not a great deal but I didn&#39;t think it was bad at all, we got to play a lot of games and I thought the time was perfect. We didn&#39;t get bored.
I wish they actually had a few more games though, we did repeat some but the night we went it wasn&#39;t too busy yet so maybe that&#39;s why?

I am a fan of the furniture and fixtures, they are quite nice.

The menu and pricing, however, is where things take a hit.

The menu features a wide variety of food items but with exorbitant pricing for the quality you get on some of them. The pizzas are nothing special and the cocktails are tiny and not worth the premium price tag, no matter how stiff the bartender makes them.

The best part are the arcade games and the bowling. The place is very clean, but they really need to have some sort of security or a more rigid reservation system in place. We had reserved two lanes for bowling, and we were given the two closest to the bar, which was fine except the entire bar had been reserved for some sort of reunion. So, not only did we not have access to the bar, we had several people sitting at our tables that had been reserved for our party. Needless to say, we were in very close quarters with strangers who had an entire bar to themselves. I think some &#34;Reserved&#34; signs on the table would have helped with this, or at least a party attendant for the large party in the bar. Based on this alone, I would not recommend this space for a large gathering. We had one server for 20 people, which I understand could be a staffing issue, but I showed up about half an hour late to the event and my friends said that there had been no one at the tables yet to take orders. When we did get a server, we only had the one for all of us, and you could tell he was getting confused. I didn&#39;t think that was very fair to him to have him handle all 20 of us. Management should have definitely giving him a serving partner, aside from the food runner who brought out the food. As we were leaving, he was really having a hard time splitting up the bill and making sure everything was paid for. That is not fair to the server at all. 

As far as food/drinks go, everything was very ok. I had the Rainbow Road sushi roll and it was just ok, definitely not worth $13, and the portion of calamari was not worth $15. Drinks were crazy strong, almost to the point of being undrinkable, but I guess that&#39;s how they justify their crazy prices. I spent $50 on just three alcoholic beverages and a Ginger Ale. That is ridiculous. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to charge so much when you are essentially a Gameworks type establishment. 

I guess my overall impression is that this place needs to find their footing. They are either for families or for adults, but they can&#39;t be for both, not with how much they charge. I cannot imagine bringing a family of 4 here to eat dinner, bowl, and play in the arcade, not with how much money it cost. It was hard enough to pay for just two adults, and we didn&#39;t even eat full entrees! As previously mentioned, the food and drinks did not even come to close to being worth the cost, I spent about $110 on calamari, sushi roll, ginger ale, and three alcoholic beverages. The marketing team definitely needs to do some sort of re-thinking here, especially if they are thinking of making it into a chain, and management needs to give their serving staff a break. I was appalled at how understaffed they were, and it is unfair to your servers and bartenders. The party of people that occupied the bar next to us? They only had one bartender for all 150 of them. Come on now, that&#39;s terrible. Please consider either adding more staff for private events, or just hiring more staff overall. It is not right to overwork these people."

Overall, it went pretty well. Did dinner first - we started with the bacon wrapped Cajun spiced dates - overall pretty good though I&#39;d personally prefer them without the Cajun &#34;touch&#34;.

For entrees, I ordered the seared trout - and they were out. Out of trout at early dinner time on a Tuesday? Kinda bummed as I hadn&#39;t had trout in quite awhile and it sounded pretty good. So the server mentions the salmon as a seafood alternative. Well, I end up ordering that though I often order salmon when I&#39;m out so not a big deal anymore. It ended up being preety good - though it was the potato gnocchi that came with it that was the feature of this dish. My nephew ordered Amish chicken - he liked it and it was one of the best value options on the menu. Came with good side dishes as well.

All the games run off of pre-loaded cards that you pass in front of a reader. While most of the games were OK, a few had some flaws. The conventional air hockey game didn&#39;t score correctly on one side. The game ends when the first person scores 7 goals... unless you&#39;re on the bad scoring side in which case the game ends when the opponent gets 7 goals. If your opponent is bad, this can make for some long games! I tried one of the pinball games, but the flippers lacked some flip to them. Some of the games were also a little slow shooting too. But nonetheless, we still had some fun.

Overall this first restaurant / gameroom concept by NAMCO is really pretty decent. Sure, there are improvements to be made, but generally it was pretty good. And the staff was fairly nice as well. Keep up the good work!"

In terms of the arcade they have basically any type of game you can think of &amp; the bowling is nice due to the fact that a waiter waits on you while you bowl.

Their system is not fair. Especially to players who are good at the games. For the measly price of $10, one can obtain a 30-minute game card usable only for one person, and you are able to play as many games as you can as soon as you swipe your first game. For me I played 2 games. At an arcade it would have cost me $.50 to play. Not worth playing. Their model should emulate Gameworks, or be exact, .$25 play so $10= 40 $.25 plays. I played one game from my youth and played for almost 20 minutes getting the high score. The other I played the remainder and finished it as well...

As far as food is concerned, I ordered the Lasagna. (PASS!) Not fresh, tasted microwaved, and for $18 I expected much better. If I come back, I&#39;ll give them another try, but I&#39;m not convinced.

Bowling was decent, floor is a bit slanted to the left on the lane we were on with our kids. Ball selection, was not present. And no hand blower or chalk...

Only entrance to Level 257 is from the exterior side of Sears. Level 257 is located where the office space/storage area was above the Children&#39;s section of Sear&#39;s (where I used to work in high school (Class of 1991)) Unfortunately it was cold and raining.

Overall they are trying. Great nostalgia as an ex-arcade guy. Big screen TV&#39;s if you are into sports. They are trying to fill a niche market much like Pinstripes, but with worse food and atmosphere. 

On a positive note because they are owned by BanDai, the shop downstair offers import Gundam models without the crazy import prices. So a large scale model that would normally cost upwards of $200 at a local Japanese import store is only $50."

Pros:
Buffet tables
Plentiful TVs
Bloody Mary bar
Omelette station
Servers
Clean

Cons:
If I had to pick a con: the hosts

Tips:
Get reservations
Get a seat with a good TV viewing angle

Level 257 sounds like a potentially fantastic time out because your other options are less clean or the food&#39;s sub par. Get reservations or you&#39;ll be asked to wait on the side like you&#39;re on time out. My experience with the hosts was lacking enthusiasm. I want a &#39;fun&#39; place to greet me like I should be happy to be there.

We had the breakfast buffet. What a treat! All the usual: eggs, sausages, potatoes, etc. And things I didn&#39;t expect: sushi, seafood, omelette station, Bloody Mary bar. So bring your drink recipe. The servers are friendly and respectful, quick on picking up plates, and iPad ready.

The venue is very clean, bowling lanes appear newly constructed. Overall Level 257 seems more for grown-ups, definitely not for loitering as a kid, and its a decent arcade option for watching a sports game while sipping your fave girly drink."

And they added a bunch of newer modern games to the arcade along with the retro classics from the 80&#39;s. So basically everything was top notch. Yes it&#39;s a bit on the expensive side, but this place is quite unique, and in July they had free bowling Monday-Thursday so that took a big dent out of the bill. We had a great time."

You needed to RSVP online and have a reservation to eat.  The games were on free play mode due to the event. They have a retro arcade which a good selection of games. The arcade was busy, but it never felt like wall to wall people.  The atmosphere is like an upscale Dave and Buster&#39;s.  They have bowling lanes with waiter service.  We did not try them so I cannot comment either way.

The menu was pricey for its offerings.  For example, pasta dishes were at least $15-20/entree.  I ended up having a burger and a Key Lime Pie martini. Service was a bit slow, but I attributed it to the fact that the space was super busy.  You also had a choice of sparkling or still water.  If it wasn&#39;t for the bowling lanes, you would think you were at an upscale restaurant. The burger was a burger. It did not stand out but did the job.  The martini was very good and smooth.  You would not know there was alcohol in it - it tasted that good.  The best part about it is that they did not charge me for my drink."

We did not want the trip to be a complete waste, and had previously been here and enjoyed it, so figured we would play some games, have a drink, and order some food.
Needless to say there was a long wait because of how packed it had been with reservations, but chef Brad made sure that we still had a very fun and fulfilling experience!

I kept going to different stations hoping I&#39;d find something I liked because I had just wasted $25, and the only thing I enjoyed was the caprese salad.  So I pretty much just spent $25 on a salad.

The seafood on ice display is nice but they don&#39;t really...serve it with anything.  Oysters are delicious and I love them but they really need something to go on them and there was nothing, so after slurping down a few I felt a little ill, particularly because these ones didn&#39;t taste good, a fact exemplified by the lack of mignonette. The shrimps did not taste fresh and were very weirdly hard.

The omelette bar has a lot of good stuff but the omelette itself was so watery that it was inedible.  My plate had a puddle on the bottom of it and the egg swam around as I cut it up.

The hot food was okay tasting in some parts -- I liked the cheesy potatoes and the bacon was really well-cooker and perfectly crispy.  However, I went to get a waffle and they were out!  It was ~12 and the brunch didn&#39;t have any waffles!  It was kind of a bummer. 

The fruit looked old. I got a few slices of watermelon and some strawberries, but both were abnormally dark and not fresh looking or tasting (you know how fruits and veggies turn dark when they&#39;ve been sitting out for too long or are too old?  Like that).  

The Bloody Mary bar and the mimosas were a hit.  Very enjoyable.  But I can&#39;t drink my brunch!

The service was great.  We were a large party and our two servers (two brunette guys, I don&#39;t remember their names but they names that started with the same letter) were SUPER attentive, always refilled our water, and were very funny and nice.

The decor is great.  The video games and bowling alley are super fun.  They&#39;ve done an excellent job with the theme and its a fun place to be.  The bathrooms are very nice but right outside of them, everything smells like a fish market and that&#39;s super unpleasant to the point of nausea.

However, despite the redeeming qualities of good service and atmosphere, I can&#39;t get over how grossed out I was by my entire meal.  Between the I feel so sick, not generally what I want after I go out and eat, particularly with seafood.  Altogether, I&#39;m really disappointed that I spent so much money to feel gross and sickened by food."

I&#39;m not kidding.  You walk through the doors of Level 257 &amp; are immediately sacked with 2 choices (ala Choose Your Own Adventure books...who remembers those?), venturing left will lead you to the forest of temptation, also known as the Pac-man themed gift shoppe, and for those who are up for the challenge, veering right will lead you to the dragon&#39;s lair, aka a mountain of stairs to ascend.  Sure there&#39;s an elevator right in between, but that doesn&#39;t exactly make an interesting story.  At any rate, man up &amp; take the stairs.

Once you&#39;ve conquered the mountain &amp; caught your breath, the expansive venue lays down before you.  Ahead is the bar, to the left and right are bowling lanes, and scattered in between is a lounge area and arcade.  Now, it&#39;s not my first time to the prom, so I studied up on my partner.  She&#39;s not a cheap date, especially for bar food and bowling.  I was glad that our work was footing the bill, otherwise I would have foregone this place for someplace a little friendlier on the wallet.

For our special event, the drinks were flowing.  I, being a good worker bee, chose the delectable and responsible club soda with a lime, which came out as a tonic with lime.  The waiter was nice enough to exchange the drink for something that wouldn&#39;t taste like citrusy earwax &amp; I was very grateful.  

We feasted like frat kings on an assortment of pizzas, meatballs, and soft pretzels.  The quality of food was average, and I&#39;m sure sub-par for the price tag.  Unfortunately this isn&#39;t the only establishment in town that&#39;s looking to do upscale adult entertainment.  While there are ample bowling lanes, the food isn&#39;t on par with these other places, in fact, I kept remarking that we should have done Pinstripes again (but who actually plays bocce ball?).  

All in all, Level 257 is worth the trek as long as someone else is footing the bill."

- Beer prices.  This isn&#39;t downtown.  Can dial it back a buck or 2.  Beer shouldn&#39;t be as expensive as cocktail made with higher quality liquor
- Bar times are ridiculous.  OVer 10 minutes for a beer and mixed drink may not seem like a long wait but when you&#39;ve spend $$$ for a game card that is dwindling away it&#39;s unacceptable.  This right here almost made my review a 3."

Decided to bring my little brother back here and he enjoyed it too, but I realized if you are only there to play arcade games it&#39;s not really enough for what you&#39;re paying.

The food was pretty good, but many of the options are just out of my comfort zone when it comes to trying new and bizarre combos. Still enjoyed it, but it was pricey.

We played games after we ate, which is fun - but again - pricey. And you have to use one card per person and can&#39;t swipe it too closely together.

This will definitely be a place we can only go in a blue moon because it&#39;s just not that affordable for my family of 4, unfortunately.

When this was brought to our server&#39;s attention, he brushed it off and basically said that it wasn&#39;t his job to sort it out--we&#39;d have to deal with it since this was organized by the event manager. There were way too many kids running around and there were hardly any free games available. We occupied ourselves with bowling but the lanes were poorly designed. The bowling balls kept falling off and rolling onto the ground when they were returned to our lanes. On top of that, the bowling balls returned back to our lanes at such a high speed that some members of our group were left with pinched fingers. Overall, I was not impressed.

I typically will not review a place if I haven&#39;t tried the food, but I&#39;m putting this review up because in the short 20 minutes while I was checking this place out with my wife and nephew, the service was exceptional.

At the end of an unsuccessful shopping day at Woodfield, I wanted to bring my 2.5 year old nephew to check out the recently opened Level 257.  (Yes, I use him as an excuse for many things).  The wife and I made our way there, walked into the first floor store, and introduced him to what pacman looks like from the various figures all over the store.  The cashier there smiled happily, welcomed us, and invited us to go upstairs and check out the space!

We made our way up, and were met with a slew of folks at the front with smiles.  I told them we weren&#39;t staying long, but heard a lot about Level 257&#39;s opening and wanted to check it out!  They pointed out all the interesting things they have there (bowling alleys, arcade area, etc.), offered a tour (which we kindly declined), and told us to stay as long as we&#39;d like.  

While we walked around checking out old school games like Galaga mixed in with new school games like four player Pacman, a manager came up and welcomed us, letting us know that there was additional catering space and pointing out where some of his favorite games were.  At the end of the conversation, he gave us a 15 minute free play card, allowing us 15 minutes to play whatever game we wanted - perfect for what just touring the space and introducing my nephew to his first arcade games!

I have to say, the phenomenal customer service while we were here won me over... I look forward to coming back with friends for some drinks and 4 player Pacman in the future!"

The atmosphere is very upscale and nice with lots of Pacman inspired elements. Although there were a lot of large groups of children, Level 257 had a more adult/lounge feel rather than family friendly atmosphere.

There wasn&#39;t a wait to be seated (we just beat a group of 10 children to the hostess stand). After being walked to the table, we were rushed to order drinks before we had the opportunity to sit down. The service was great, although we were extremely confused by the fact that atleast FIVE different people served us. My friend received his soda twice, and I received sugar for my tea from two different people as well.. There must have been some lack of communication with serving tables.. We really didn&#39;t mind that though!

The food was troublesome for me. With such a nice atmosphere, you would expect a quality meal to match! First of all, the menu on their website is different than the actual menu.. They have have a separate lunch menu, but I didn&#39;t see anything printed on it to indicate that. For people saying &#34;go somewhere else if you want cheap bar food&#34; guess what? Level 257 serves expensive bar food. There was nothing remarkable, memorable, or unique about the food. I ordered a spicy BBQ pork sandwich and fries.. The sauce was overwhelmingly sweet, to the point where I could only manage to eat half of it. The fries weren&#39;t salted or seasoned. My friends ordered a burger and pizza which also looked subpar. My sandwich and iced tea were $22.00.

Overall, without sounding like a snob.. I had much higher hopes for Level 257 based off the hype and atmosphere. This place seems like it would be fun for grabbing drinks and playing games on the weekend, but honestly save yourself the experience (and money) and grab food somewhere else beforehand."

Got here 9:30pm on a Saturday night to bowl and booze. Simple right? 

Wrong. 

There were kids running WILD everywhere! How&#39;s about a curfew on weekends? (And shame on the parents for letting your kids run wild. Get a sitter. We did. Wtf).  

Said kids kept hitting ping pong balls into our bowling lane, running in front of our lane, you name it, it happened. Then these brats went to the manager and told her we were swearing at them. (We were probably swearing within our group, not at them!) instead of finding the parents to these future aholes she confronted us like ok guys what&#39;s going on. Um. They are 10, high on sugar and overtired. Bye. 

Service. Sucked. Took forever to get drinks. Over an hour to get water. 

My pregnant friend ordered some green tea ice cream dessert. They brought out vanilla and just left. We had to ask what the mix up was, the answer &#34;oh. We are out of green tea.&#34;  Ugh. 

The bathrooms were filthy, out of toilet paper in stalls. I don&#39;t care about your hand tolled real towel hand towels. Clean the disgusting stalls and floor and restock tp. Pretty simple. 

Then. To top it off at the end of the night after we closed out, our server comes back up to us and is like &#34;bad news, I charged your drinks to someone else&#39;s table, so I&#39;m short!&#34; 
It was less than $20 but you just don&#39;t do that. I have no clue if he was being honest or just scamming for another $20 but you tell your manager and they comp it.

I have tried so many indian restaurant but none of them come even close to this when it comes down to taste. I used to go to Mast Masala which is where they originally started but same owner left that place and started here and now I get the same taste and great food i used to. Do not go anywhere else if you really want best punjabi food.

We spoke to the owners afterwards to let them know how great it was. They seemed nice and thankful. They had their son doing his homework in the front and he was well behaved. All around great experience with the food. They do not serve alcohol which was a bummer but the food made up for it. We would consider catering from here one day. Oh and the check was a shock. Very affordable. We usually spend twice as much somewhere else. I heart India Foodie!"

While the flavor of the food is really nothing out of the ordinary, there&#39;s other factors which make this a good place to visit.

The food itself is reasonably priced, not overly seasoned, and prepared in a cook-to-order manner (so it&#39;ll take a little longer, but it&#39;ll come out hotter and fresher). The menu is pretty diverse with everything from shakes to smoothies to desserts -- pizza to wings to burgers to gyros to pasta. There&#39;s a bunch of combos available with the option to substitute a drink with a milkshare or smoothie for an additional $1.50. Everything I tried here was satisfactory although nothing that really stands out in its individual categories.

What I really liked about the restaurant though was the restaurant itself. The parking is spacious, service is very quick and friendly, the dining room resembles a family restaurant more than a normal fast food establishment, everything from the TVs to the trash receptacles are of a nicer than normal quality, and the dining room itself is very spacious.

This combination creates an interesting experience. A way to enjoy the normal fast food favorites but in a much more comfortable setting. A place to watch a game without being in a dark bar setting but having the neccessary elements of pizza, wings, and beer at a reasonable price. It seems like an unusual combination, but manages to appeal to a wide group."

But not in this case.  I walked in and was greeted right away and told them I was new and needed a few mins.  I&#39;m guessing one of the owners here asked me how I heard of them so I told him and he was very friendly and seemed very genuine.

After selecting a burger (I know so ordinary but it&#39;s for burger in the name!  Geez!). After walking around a bit I saw they had pizza by the slice do I had to add this as I can be a pizza snob and had to try it out.  Well, they gave it to me for free for being a first timer which was nice but they also gave me a free drink which is their normal for customers picking up and having to wait.

I admit I played it safe with a double cheeseburger. I also got some cheese sticks, because why not? I got there probably around 12:15, so understandably the place was pretty busy for the lunch rush, and the only negative for me was that the staff seemed stretched thin, slightly hindering their customer service.

We can argue that some other time. I was relieved to find another place near by and it had decent reviews so I decided to give it a shot. By the end of it all, I was completely underwhelmed. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had better since it&#39;s my only experience with Italian beef sandwiches, but it was definitely &#34;Meh&#34;. A forgettable sandwich.

- Italian Beef (4/10)
- Gyros (6/10)

I ALSO TRIED
- Baron Burger (4/10)
- Fries (6/10)

Ya know, one of the biggest perks of working near Woodfield is that there are a billion places to eat! But strangely enough, even that gets monotonous at times! So, one day, I ventured out really far - and as I came across Golf and Arlington Heights, I noticed this place &#34;Burger Baron.&#34; Now, I get suuuuper excited when I see a restaurant that A) is not a chain and B) I&#39;ve never heard of! 

I only now realized, thanks John K, that this used to be Garabaldi&#39;s. When I walked in, my first thought was &#34;Wow! This place looks just like Garabaldi&#39;s!&#34; Turns out there&#39;s good reason. So, it looks like Garabaldi&#39;s, but the menu is just a little more Greek than Italian. Sort of like a Goodi&#39;s (Glenview/Niles) with Pizza. 

It must be fairly new, because there weren&#39;t many reviews, so I had to fly blind.

GYROS
Pretty standard fare. Warm pita, with gyro meat, a dollop of tzatziki sauce, and then wrapped. It&#39;s no Mr. Greek&#39;s, but it&#39;ll do. Meat was cooked properly, wasn&#39;t charred or burnt. PIta was warm and soft. I especially like wrapped gyros (as opposed to gyro plates), because the tzatziki sauce would sort of melt and infuse with everything because of the trapped heat. Maybe I didn&#39;t give it enough time, because the dollop still looked very much like a dollop and so it wasn&#39;t really distributed. If I felt like a gyro, I&#39;d have no problem getting it again.

ITALIAN BEEF
This was actually the one I was most excited to try. Unfortunately, it&#39;s disappointing. The beef may have enough seasoning, but not a lot of flavor. It&#39;s nothing like a Buona or Portillo&#39;s beef. The beef was thinly sliced, but it was actually a bit dry. Plus the giardiniera was not very flavorful either. Buona&#39;s got the best giardiniera I think. Even Portillo&#39;s has a nice flavor to it, but this was sort of sour but without personality. Also, they serve this crazy hot! I almost burned my lips trying to take a bite! Plus, it&#39;s so juicy (read: watery) that the bun disintegrates under it, so there&#39;s really no easy way to eat it or even hold it. For the lack of flavor, bad texture, and huge hassle, I&#39;d avoid this.

BARON BURGER
Burger Baron calls themselves &#34;Home of the Burger.&#34; That, my friends, is totally incorrect! While the origin is up for debate, it was circa 1885-1900...not a mere 30 years ago. History aside, I tried their namesake menu item. 

I do have to say, it may be the best &#34;medium&#34; I&#39;ve ever had in a patty. We&#39;re talking technical marks here, not flavor, because in the flavor arena, it was pretty flat! Not completely flatline, but pretty boring. Not much seasoning either, but it borrowed from the American cheese. Just has sloppy lettuce and I asked for grilled onions. Unfortunately, not a winner. It didn&#39;t come with any sauce, so I guess you&#39;re supposed to add your own ketchup and mustard? Well, in any case, maybe their other &#34;gourmet&#34; burgers are ok, but their standard stuff is pretty yawn inspiring.

FRIES
They do have pretty good fries, at least the first time I had them. They&#39;re about double the size of McDonald&#39;s fries, and imagine their outer layer being extremely crispy, but at the same time, extremely thin, so it&#39;s definitely more delicate than McD&#39;s, but a nice euphoric crisp. It can just barely stand alone in terms of seasoning, but ketchup accompanies it well. After the first time, though, they&#39;ve been getting a little flimsier.

BURGER PEASANT
They have a huge menu, so maybe I just haven&#39;t found their forte yet, but at least from my experiences with the big 3 menu items from a &#34;city-food&#34; joint, they aren&#39;t doing so hot. The size of their menu is what&#39;s going to keep me coming back, and it&#39;s not like it&#39;s bad food, it&#39;s just mediocre, so far. Maybe there&#39;s a diamond in the rough?"

You know - when you realize that you chose poorly? i.e. I ordered a burger at Burger Baron (makes perfect sense, right?), but after perusing the pics on Yelp, I immediately saddened as the gyro salad looks bomb-tastic. I shall go back for that. But that&#39;s a review for a different day, I hope. Let&#39;s focus on what I actually ordered...

The Good:
-The folks who work here are super sweet and friendly
-The menu is very diverse - burgers, sandwiches, gyros, plenty o&#39; fried goodness, even treats/desserts 
-Casual environment and pretty clean overall
-Very affordable - especially considering the portions
-Tasty fries! 
-Burgers and sandwiches are very customizable, which I much appreciate

The Bad:
-The burger patties are seemingly frozen and of Coscto quality. 
-I ordered my cheddar jalapeno burger medium and it came out completely well and frankly, pretty flavorless. 
-Said jalapenos came right out of the can. Sad. 
-The Southwest salad sounded great but came out a bit of a disappointment. The dressing was runny and there wasn&#39;t much goodness listed on the menu (limited corn, beans, etc). 

I hope to hit up Burger Baron again for a redemption meal...I see that gyro salad in my future."

The first time I got a burger, fries and onion rings. Everything was poor. Although it took a good 10-15 minutes to fill my order, the burger was cold and bland tasting. My impression was it had not been made to order. 

I gave them another chance about a week later. This time I got the gyros plate. It was poor. The meat was hard tasting and dry (like leftovers).

Now that I&#39;m consumed by beef (insert perverted comment here), I consider myself somewhat of a burger expert.  &#34;Burger Baron&#34; should really be one too, being a baron and all, but alas, it was a regular old burger in a regular old joint.  (I was amazed, however, of the ability of this Greek joint to taste the same as the last one I was at.  Seriously.  I could have had this same burger at any Greek place in the area and not notice a difference at all.  At least there&#39;s consistency?)    

Some things to note (wherein I say some nice things so I don&#39;t feel so bad)-  Burger Baron has friendly staff, a menu that is pretty extensive, clean facilities (although I can&#39;t seem to get Garibaldi&#39;s visions out of my head), nice flatscreens, and good food.

I was impressed with the clean floors and vast menu. Sadly, that&#39;s where it ends for me. 

I ordered a burger with crisp bacon and a side of onion rings. I had real plans for this burger...eat half the burger and a couple rings then bring the leftovers home for my 15 year old eating machine. The receipt said cheeseburger. I told the girl at the register again that I did NOT want cheese. She said, oh it just says that and then proceeded to tell the guys in back that I did not want cheese. I waited.  A while. I was the only order and surprised it was taking so long. 

Wanna know what I really thought?  I thought: Aw nuts!  They put cheese on the burger and they&#39;re remaking it. Good catch, guys!

Wanna know what really happened?  They took a while to make the burger and when the gentleman from the back brought out my to-go bag, I asked about the cheese on the burger. He didn&#39;t know, so he yelled &#39;queso?&#39; to the guy in back. Guess what?  There was cheese on my &#39;took a long time for nothing&#39; burger!  I almost sat down to wait for round two, but things moved much quicker this time. The two guys stood huddled over my burger behind the counter and arrived back momentarily in front. No cheese...have a nice day - this was my send off. 

I open it up. Cheese all over the wrapper (inside and out) and specks of cheese on the burger. So, apparently they picked some of the cheese off for me. Thanks, but no thanks for my $7 burger. By the way, the $3.55 onion rings were salted so much that I couldn&#39;t even eat those. $11.27 later. Order #2042 on 05/29/12. Disappointed. 

One more thing. The girl at the front counter commented in how hungry she was. You and me both, sister. Anyhow, after she took my order, she stepped over maybe five feet and started eating. Chicken fingers, I think. This is so not okay. Eat in a break room. Or on a break at a table in the dining area. Not at the end of the front counter. 

I&#39;m trying to think of something witty to say at the end of this review. Maybe something to sum it all up. I&#39;ve got nothing. And neither did my tummy."

Now it&#39;s a classy burger &amp; gyros joint. Inside, it really has most of the appearance of the old Garibaldi&#39;s with its booths, tables, and general location of things in the restaurant. We came here on a Sunday for lunch at noon.

Burger Baron carries quite an extensive menu and it takes some time to study it and decide, I must warn you. I chose a 1/3 pound cheeseburger with everything and my wife took the turkey burger. My kids got spaghetti, which was served in a heaping bowl. One order probably would have been enough to feed them both. The sauce was excellent so we had plenty of good leftovers to bring home too.

While I&#39;m not a turkey burger enthusiast, I must admit I liked the taste of the piece my wife gave me, since it had good, rich flavor and it wasn&#39;t dry at all, which is not the dry and bland turkey burger I&#39;ve tried at other places. I&#39;d even consider a turkey burger for a future visit.

Sweet potato fries were very good too. Getting our orders made right was a problem, though, as the person preparing the food was unfamiliar with what comes with a meal. Things got straightened out quickly but the place still shows signs of being a new joint just getting started. 

The shakes here look very impressive and I&#39;d be tempted to try one next time. All kids meals include ice cream, which is a plus too. I do miss the slushy Italian lemonade that Garibaldi&#39;s used to have, so let me drop in that suggestion in case a Burger Baron manager checks out my review.

I&#39;d definitely come back here and try one of the bigger Baron burgers next time."

My eyes landed upon the word &#34;feta&#34; which was followed by &#34;burger,&#34; and I knew I had found the one for me.

Almost everything is customizable. I ordered the burger without pickles or mustard and asked for it to be cooked medium-well. It was out in a jiffy along with my side of fries. They deliver it to your table and I immediately dug into it. The patty is flavorful and the feta was bold, just how I like it.

I didn&#39;t order dessert this time, but they have baklava and tiramisu. I will definitely be back."

Walking in I was kind of hesitant, having had plenty of burger joints in the area. Though I realized how great of a place it actually was when I witnessed its food and atmosphere.

I was indecisive between a burger and a beef my second time around, and asked for some help from the employees as to what they prefered. Both employees puzzled, I decided to settle with the blue cheese burger. When they handed me my bags one of the employees let me know that they gave me a free sample of their beef, which was pretty awesome customer service. 

I enjoyed both, and they made me a very happy customer, I will definitely be back.

I know that that, in and of itself is a crime, but I was feeling like something semi healthy.  The cashier entered in the order and a voice from the kitchen told him to just charge it as a BLT and not add a charge for the avocado. Score. Thank you mystery man..not that it&#39;s a big deal to pay a little extra for customizing..but it was a nice little gesture. Anyway..they forgot the silverware when they brought the food out so I was walking along the counter and the voice came from the kitchen again &#34;Gerald, find out what the lady needs&#34; Now mind you there&#39;s people at the counter, and sizzling in the kitchen and a pretty tall wall between us. I applaud this guy&#39;s attentiveness to his customers.  My BLT (alt) was very satisfying. I know it&#39;s hard to mess this one up, but they didn&#39;t skimp on the avocados, the veggies were fresh and it was just tasty. The fries were good. Even when they got cold they weren&#39;t bad. I&#39;d skip the cheese because it tasted more like Mac and cheese cheese than cheese fry cheese.  We&#39;re definitely coming back to try the burgers."

I was a little wary when I walked in because restaurants with such an extensive menu usually don&#39;t have good food. The burgers and fries here were pretty decent and well-priced. I would definitely come here more often and try more menu items if I lived closer.

I have to admit that my expectations were not all that high, but my wife and I were hungry and nearby.  I ended up ordering the Italian Beef hot and juicy with fries.  The sandwich was massive, both in size and flavor.  The fries were also crispy and delicious.  

Burger Baron is nothing fancy, but the food is solid.  I actually could really go for another Italian Beef right now...."

We visited this place several times since it opened.  In all occassions, front counter/cashiers were always teenage kids.  (Talked to one of them and apparently he was the owner&#39;s son.  Gave us the history of the place: How it was converted from Garibaldi&#39;s to Burger Baron).  Very nice, well-mannered kid.  Everytime we entered the door, in all occassions, we were always greeted with a &#34;Hello!&#34; or a &#34;Welcome to Burger Baron!&#34;  When we left, we were always sent off with a &#34;Thank you!&#34;

+ Hispanic chef/cook from the back always brought our food to our table with a smile.  Special requests?  No problem.  Super nice.  

+ BIG FOOD PORTIONS! 

+ 3 tv&#39;s in restaurant playing different channels.  My husband and father-in-law always make us sit near the tv playing sports, of course. The volumes are not super loud so the restaurant is still talk-friendly.

+ Family-friendly and kid-friendly place.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

- Only criticism is tables/chairs/booths need to be wiped clean as soon as customers leave.  We had to play musical tables during some visits because some tables still had food particles on it when we sat down."

In spite of the large menu, we decided to go with burgers. Bf had a 1/2 pound one (bacon cheddar) and I had the 1/3 pound cheeseburger.  They were both cooked perfectly to order and had a delicious char-grilled flavor.  We had Greek potatoes as a side.  Tasty meal, reasonably priced. 

Having gotten tired of how every quick-food type of place now seems to blast the music, it was a pleasure to dine with the music at a very moderate level that didn&#39;t make conversation a challenge. 

We&#39;ll be back, and next time I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll try a Greek dish."

DELICIOUS! i have eaten here everyday the past 4 days, just so i could try a little bit of everything =). the place just opened up this past friday, thank god! (arlington heights has needed a place like this) I have gotten the 1/2 lb burger, the gyro, the combo (italian beef and sausage), the big fat greek combo, and a pizza puff! 

the burger was charbroiled so it had that awesome grill taste and its cooked to order so none of that been sitting around all day crap!

since the place is greek owned i had a feeling the gyros would be awesome and i was not disappointed! i got the regular gyro but i noticed they have chicken ones too!!! have to try that.

my husband ordered the fat greek combo and OMG its huge! totally enough for 2 or more. 2 kabobs a chicken a reg gyro pitas and a salad and rice!!!! all for 11$ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

now to my favorite!! the combo and the pizza puff. the combo was the best I have ever had and i do not take that lightly. i put the beef above johnnies anyday. the staff is nice over here too!! lol. i had never had a pizza puff before and i cant believe i have missed out on this 8th wonder of the world for so long. it was DELICIOUS! i couldnt believe it. i usually come home and get out of my work clothes and turn the tv on and then worry about my food. this time something told me to just try it. ( curiosity) i couldnt put it down. i stood there, in the kitchen, and ate the WHOLE THING!!!!! i almost sent my husband to get another one!!!!!

I will definitely be coming back, this is my new spot!!!!"

In the Arlington heights area there are so many restaurants to choose from. On my way home on a Sunday Afternoon 6/8, my husband and I decided to stop at the restaurant to get something to go. I specifically told the gentleman taking the order that I have a 6 week old in the car with my husband and to make sure the food was done in a timely manner. After waiting 25 minutes for a to go order, it was not done in a timely manner, not to mention when we got home the food was not even hot and I live less than 5 mins away. The place was not busy at all, and ticket times for common things are about 5-7. I have been in hospitality for over 15 years so the normal, &#34;That food item takes a while card&#34; does not over here. Anything friend 6-8 min ticket time, burgers 5-7 or less. The fact that it took 25 mins on an empty Sunday afternoon was ridiculous and then the food not even being hot was just insulting. Plus the gentleman taking the order saying it will be done fast due to me having the child in the car, just let us know the integrity of the employees when that didn&#39;t happen. I was also not the only to go customer saying the food was extending 25 minute ticket times. Maybe this restaurant needs to re-evaluate how long food items should take, make sure the food is hot, to train their staff better, and to be more accommodating to the customers. We have a lot of choices, and we chose your restaurant and you failed us."

It also came with your choice of side salad, side and garlic bread(I change that to a pita). Not only was the food GREAT... so was everyone that works there. I love the Owners down to the cooks, everyone their is awesome. I go there at least once a week up to 3 times a week. I love their soups(also made fresh daily AND their homemade), salads, Greek chicken, PASTTITSIO is one of MY fave(I&#39;m Greek), my ex loved the gyros, my friend loves the Italian beef, best friend loves the spinach pie...

Tomczak&#39;s offers you a choice of 3 kinds of beer-battered fish; Perch, Cod &amp; Catfish.  They are all good and each of them is better than any other fish fry in the area.  My favorite is the Catfish, but the Cod is a very close second.  It all depends on whether you like a lighter or more bold flavored fish.

An AYCE Catfish basket is $9 and you can get Labatt&#39;s &amp; Lite on tap or a $2 PBR Tall Boy.  I noticed posters for Revolution Anti-hero (in cans) and Bell&#39;s Oberon Ale (bottles) so you can grab a craft brew if you prefer.

Same Northwoods tavern atmosphere, same great food, same great value and same friendly service.  With a combination like that, why would you settle for a crappy fish fry?  &#34;Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that...&#34;"

I went to Tomczak&#39;s knowing it was a dive bar &amp; grill type of place and it totally is. I loved the cute atmosphere all decorated for Christmas. Don&#39;t go expecting fancy decor, fancy atmosphere or fancy people but do go in knowing you&#39;re going to get some tasty, cheap food and a super friendly guy cooking your food. It kind of seemed to be a one man show, he was holding it all down and doing a pretty good job. It was all regulars at the bar and no one seated in the dining area. There are big TVs which made for good viewing for the Sunday football games.

Due to the lack of beer corn dogs, I ended up ordering another interesting choice - A polish with ham and cheese. It was a strange combo but delicious! My friend and I had a nice chill time, ate and rolled out.

If you saw Tomczak&#39;s from the outside, you&#39;d agree with me.  It&#39;s a bar.  But I learned that it&#39;s a bar that serves some tasty Fish Fry every Friday night.  I was skeptical, because y&#39;know, it looks like a bar.  

Their Friday night fish fry is All you can Eat and you get a choice of cod, catfish and perch. My go-to is Cod, but I&#39;m definitely going to try the catfish next time. The fillets are a nice size, have a nice battered coating and served piping hot. They weren&#39;t greasy or over done. They also come with a side of fries, coleslaw and garlic bread. The fries and garlic bread were great, but the coleslaw was very bland. I love coleslaw so I was a little disappointed with this serving.

We also tried the chicken tenders and they were pretty tasty but my guess would be that they are pre-prepared or packaged.  Sorry I can&#39;t remember what else was on the menu because we were there for the fish!

There are two sections inside---a bar section with a few casino machines, and the dining section--basically about 7 tables.  The dining section is family friendly which really surprised me. They had high chairs too!  Just a few families dining that night, most of the other patrons were older couples. . They just make it clear that children cannot cross over to the bar section. And I&#39;m sure that after dinner hours, no kids would be allowed inside at all. 

Service was kind of friendly, kind of sarcastic, kind of like Flo from the TV show Alice.  For a townie institution like T-zaks, I would have expected nothing less.

Reasonable (cheap!) prices.  $2 PBRs."

Quite the dive bar, with old decor and tables but I&#39;ve come to appreciate that sometimes those are the places that serve some of the best food. 

Having read all the positive fish fry reviews, I decided that we&#39;d go here over the golf course (who has been doing the fish fry for years).

My husband had the cod lunch special for
$6.75 and my dad had the all you can eat perch fish fry for $11.00. My dads plate was huge so he did not end up getting a second helping!  I think its also worth saying that you have to pick one type of fish, since they&#39;re all different prices. 

In regards to the fish, both of them agreed that the fish was delicious, the batter was perfect BUT the tartar sauce was missing something... Not tart enough. Both said it tasted like basic mayo. I had a burger since I&#39;m not a big fish lover- and enjoyed it. They toast the bun and the burger was just how I liked it. I was pleasantly surprised. 

Service was friendly and the food was good. Only reason I&#39;m rating it a 4 was because it was so cold in there and because of the tartar sauce--"

Food is fried with a grease that tastes like yesterday and there are more teeth in their fried perch than on their patrons.  Unless your a retired union plumber or you want to experience l the wrong end of a Phillips screw driver I suggest you stay away.

The fish fry is better than anywhere I&#39;ve ever had one! The cheeseburgers are absolutely delicious, as are all their sandwiches. The secret to their good food?

Being located 40 minutes away from us in Schaumburg however, it was usually in the late afternoon or evening if we happened to be in the area for a specific errand. Other times we would simply opt for a place closer to the house, or use the excuse to go downtown which was an equal distance away. 

A few months ago we were in the burbs for a wedding, and you could practically see Wildberry from our hotel. We decided to skip our complimentary breakfast to come here instead and were so glad we did. 

I was immediately pleased to see they use NoWait. This is a free app you need to download if you haven&#39;t already. It reduces your wait time by keeping a live feed of how many parties are ahead of you (side note- you have to be 30 miles or less away to be added to the line).

Another thing we loved was that they put a coffee bar in the waiting area. Genius! Had we not been seated right away from getting there so early, we definitely would have taken advantage of that. They stock the good stuff too (Intelligentsia). I ordered a cinnamon spice latte and it was delicious! Foamy and rich with a generous dusting of cinnamon on top. That&#39;s how I would like to start every morning from now on, thanks.

For my meal, I decided on their signature berry bliss waffle. It comes topped with fresh berries, a giant dollop of berry mascarpone, and a drizzle of vanilla anglaise and blackberry coulis sauces. I was expecting a sucker punch of sweet, but the flavors were actually well balanced and mellow. I put the gigantic mound of mascarpone to the side of my plate and ate maybe a quarter of it, but it was all very good.

My husband was feeling more savory so he ordered the brisket hash. He said for a breakfast place, the brisket was actually great! He got a side of blueberry pancakes too which he also enjoyed. 

The portions here are ridiculous, so sharing is encouraged. I&#39;m a little sad that we found a great breakfast place after the fact, but it will give us something to look forward to for future visits."

I haven&#39;t really tried the other dishes but the ladies In my brunch party loved their dishes.

The only downside is the wait on the weekends; one time it was just my daughter and I and we waited over 1 1/2 hours!  We usually come here during the week when it&#39;s not nearly as busy."

Service is always stellar. Every server is friendly and efficient. Ensuring you get your food in your belly ASAP. And of course that you enjoy it. 

Pro Tip: download the no wait app so you can grab a place in line and cut your wait time. And also get a coffee to go from their coffee bar. 

The only con: I desperately wish for them to serve Bloody Mary&#39;s. #alcoholicproblems"

I came here on a Monday around 9am and was able to get seated right away although I noticed the place was pretty filled already. I love how lively it was-- it was very well lit, had plenty of seating, and the staff was very friendly. 

Once we got seated, the waitress immediately came over and took our orders for drinks. My boyfriend ordered a coffee and I ordered the organic passion iced green tea, which was on the seasonal menu for summer. We were served our drinks within a few minutes and our server gave us more time to look over the menu.

While I think this place is more known for the crepes/pancakes/french toast, we both ordered eggs benedicts. My boyfriend ordered the Southern Benedict and I ordered the Corned Beef Benny.

I actually asked to swap the english muffins on the Corn Beef Benny with biscuits, and I&#39;m so glad I did! The biscuits were super fluffy went perfectly with the corn beef. It was topped with really good chipotle hollandaise sauce and was served with a very generous portion of hash browns. Next time, I&#39;ll order the corned beef and hash browns crispy, but they were both really good!

Our server was really sweet and was always around if we needed anything. When we asked for our check, she got us a refill of our drinks to go.

The food was great and the service was awesome. I&#39;ll be back!"

My mom and I came here around 8:45am on a Wednesday. There was no wait, but their parking lot was almost full and almost all the tables were full! It was a lot of business meetings and younger people. It wasn&#39;t loud but it was still quite lively. There was seating outside too.

Our server, Bianca, was nice but almost overly so. She went out of her way to compliment my purse and my mom&#39;s necklace, and laughed pretty hard at things my mom said that, imho, weren&#39;t *that* funny. My mom liked her though. Maybe I&#39;m just a cynic.

I like that you can order half servings of the pancakes, crepes, and French toast! This allowed us to try even more things on the menu.

* Specialty Pancakes: Signature Berry Bliss ($4.50 half, $10.50 full) - 3.5 stars. Soft &amp; moist! Fresh fruit is great. Cream topping is slightly savory.

* Belgian Waffles: Caramel Apple Pecan ($10) - 2.5 stars. Quite dry, &amp; apples are undercooked - too hard!

* French Toast Creations: Banana Bread ($5 half, $10 full) - 3 stars. Banana bread is good, but lacks the crisp + stretchy middle part.

It&#39;s a brunch spot and while I love the thought of enjoying a late morning filling yourself up on eggs and pancake, brunch is the easiest food in the world. So here I am, at Wildberry Cafe and the thing to order is the Skillet with a choice of pancakes.

You get the sweet, you get the savory. The ultimate in brunching technique. I got the Garden Skillet with sausage and tried the Signature Pancake: Banana Cream pie. When it comes out, it&#39;s no joke - a beautifully garnished two stack of fluffy pancakes, cookie crumble, whip cream and banana pudding (the dessert) came out along with a large metal plate of food. Tasty cheesy goodness, lots of vegetables, filling and a good deal - def very splitable. So much food, there&#39;s no way I would ever make this much at home, so yeah, at least this brunch is not just plain eggs and toast, it&#39;s a over-indulgent treat.

As for the wait, it can be long, so get the No Wait app and get in line. It was pretty accurate and happy that we got seated right away."

Despite the busy atmosphere, I was so impressed at how quickly my party was seated and served. In a truly difficult decision, I ordered the mushroom and prosciutto omelet special, which was to die for. Salty and tender, this magical breakfast wonder melted in my mouth. Served with hash browns and toast, this could have easily been a meal for two people! The presentation was beautiful, and I doubt you&#39;ll find a better omelet in Schaumburg.

The best thing about the menu is the diverse range of options. The speciality benedict selection also looked outstanding, and if anything, I simply found myself regretting not ordering a crepe! Crepes are ALWAYS a good idea, and this will be on my plate next time, without question. Everyone can find something they love on the menu at Wildberry, I can absolutely see how they can be slammed during high volume times!"

Pros: Great service; Nice atmosphere; Delicious Food; Affordable prices; Very organized

Cons: No reservations

Details: First time I tried Wildberry Cafe in downtown. It was fabulous! Today, I wanted to compare it with Schaumburg location. I was not disappointed. Actually, I was even pleasantly surprised!

My fiance and I arrived there ~10:30am for a branch. There was no line and receptionist gave us the best booth ever - right in the middle of the restaurant! It was, kind of, just for two of us and at the same time in the middle of everything.

The restaurant was very clean and waiters were extremely polite. We ordered Florence Benedict, Mediterranean Chicken Wrap (that I loved from the first time) and Fresh Glazed Blueberries Pancake. I also ordered Cappuccino.

Our waiter asked if we are going to share and recommended additional plates - Thank You!

Cappuccino arrived first and right after it rest of the food. It was surprisingly quick. We started from the Wrap and my fiance noticed a reason why I liked it in the first place - sauce was very sweet. 1000% right - the sauce was very sweet and wrap had plenty of it, which made it very juicy - exactly as I liked it! It was a bit too sweet for her.

Benedict was fantastic as it could only be. I ate my half enjoying every bite. Next was the pancake. As soon as they brought it, we knew that it was not the one we thought about. Apparently, we wanted &#34;Signature Berry Bliss&#34;, but ordered &#34;Fresh Glazed Blueberries&#34;. We asked waiter for the sauces from the &#34;Signature&#34; and put them on the pancakes ourselves. It was not as aesthetic as from the chef, but still really delicious :).

Overall, we had a magnificent branch. We took leftover home and I finished pancakes couple of hours ago for the dinner :). YUMMY!!!"

I ordered the portobello Benedict (seasonal special) and it was awesome!! The chipotle hollandaise sauce was tangy and not as buttery as hollandaise usually is. The English muffin got super soggy though. 

My friend ordered the Espanola omelette and she loved it. Both orders came with hash browns &amp; toast. 

The service was a little slow, possibly understaffed? But nothing too bad! Their coffee is strong &amp; good and they have a lot of unique latte flavors as well."

Everyone else seems to have the same idea.  There are few times when you walk in and do not have to wait, but it can and does happen  

The menu is amazing.  There are so many choices and some of them you will not find anywhere else.  What do you have a taste for?  Plain eggs and bacon or Benedicts, skillets, omelets, waffles, crepes, wraps, panini, salads, sandwiches, and soup. How about splurging on Banana Cream Pie pancakes, or Oreo S&#39;mores.  Dreaming about French Toast, maybe you&#39;re in the mood for Red Velvet, Cinnamon Roll or Caramel Apple Pecan?  One of my favorite dishes is the Rustic Farm Panini with scrambled eggs instead of over easy.  They will make it your way if they can.

The menu is extensive and the portions are overly generous. I am wild about their chicken salad with homemade strawberry bread, with a side of fruit and fresh berries.  I am also perfectly happy with their oatmeal with cranberries and walnuts.  There are way too many things to mention, but you will definitely find something you love and probably have leftovers!

Their coffee bar is great.  You can buy a cup when you come in if there is a wait, or you can order it from your table.  They offer a great selections of espressos and mocha beverages and, of course, chai tea. 

The servers are extremely friendly and go out of their way to get you whatever you want.  It is bright and cheerful and the seats are comfortable. Because there are tile floors and high ceilings it can get pretty noisy in there, but most people are there to have a fun experience and don&#39;t mind.

Kids love this place and there is a great kid&#39;s menu.  You will see a lot of happy little smiles.

The only issue is there can be a problem finding a parking space.  After around 11 a.m the restaurant adjacent opens for lunch and the two businesses share the parking lot.  Across the street is the west end of Costco&#39;s parking lot.  Sometimes you can get lucky, sometimes not.
If you have children that need to be carried, or anyone who has difficulty walking, it might be better to drop them off right in front while you go find a space. On the positive side, they can walk in and put your name on the list.

My best guess is that you will have a good time, enjoy the food and definitely come back."

ANYWAY, now that my complaint is out of the way, this place is PHENOMENAL! The service is great. Our waiter was really nice and organized. Even though the wait to get in is no joke, they&#39;re much quicker in getting you&#39;re food out to you!

Taste wise, everything was GREAT. I got the seasonal turkey chili &amp; cheddar omelet. Man was it good! It had awesome flavors and the cornbread on the plate complemented it perfectly.

Huge portions and hearty food, as it should be in the suburbs or Chicago. Good coffee also- I especially liked the hazelnut flavored brew they had that day, except they ran out of it towards closing time.

Our food choices:
-Slow roast brisket hash was the favorite of the table- super hearty and delicious, with plenty of leftovers to take home. 
-The mexicana skillet was also delicious. 
-My parents thought the tavern burger was too much meat and too hearty. Tasty, but they were glad they split it. Sweet potato fries were awesome. 
-wild berry salad was light and refreshing (one of the fewer on the menu) and a good accompaniment to the heavier choices we had
-Rutherford omelette was very tasty and yummy. The goat cheese added a nice flavor to the bacon

I had the Denver skillet with perfect hash browns! I liked how they were crispy but also some soft pieces. The ham, green peppers were cut well and so everything blended well together. It didn&#39;t feel like I was eating chunks of something. At first I thought the portion was small because the skillet seemed shallow. But I was wrong, great portion sizes! I paid a little extra for one of their specialty pancakes. Usually it&#39;s a $10 order but it was $1.50 to up charge. A good deal! After such a hearty skillet a smaller portion of the pancakes was perfect. I had the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes which was great!

Bottomless Intelligentsia coffee a plus! And our glasses of water were always full. 

Friendly staff and nice homey ambience. There is an option to dine al fresco, but with it being muggy and hot, I decided to pass on that. :). I could tell it&#39;s a popular place as most of the tables were occupied on a Monday at 10am (does anyone work? :D). I will be back soon to try more of the menu!"
wildberry-cafe-schaumburg-3,Robby W.,QC_g-og4viJ9gjK2pjJteg,"Hoffman Estates, IL",1,1,1,198,116,8wyd5W3aH7uml2XcRpp7ww,5.0,2015-09-25,"For most people, breakfast food is most frequently consumed, yep, you guessed it, at breakfast time. For certain others, it is food you turn to at 3:30 in the morning when you are wasted to the point that even a toxic, microwave burrito from 7-11 sounds appealing (admit it, you have ate one before). Wildberry has food that is good enough that you would not hesitate to have breakfast at all random points in between. This is without question my #1 in the Schaumburg area for breakfast foods. I have been here several times and have yet to have anything less than an excellent experience. 

The parking lot here is huge, which is handy since it has been packed to capacity every time I have ever visited. If you plan on showing up either during breakfast time itself, or around lunchtime, do yourself a favor and show up early. The fact that this place rocks is hardly a secret to the people who live in this area. Saturday morning is the craziest I have ever seen this place, with a good hour wait to get a table. I am an extremely impatient person, so if I am willing to wait an hour to eat at a restaurant then that is a pretty good indicator said restaurant is on the level. 

The interior of the restaurant is contemporary and cozy and wait staff here has always been pleasant and efficient. Even when the joint is crazy busy I have never had to wait more than 20 min. on food to be delivered. 

Speaking of food, this place is a true breakfast lovers paradise. They really have something to accommodate just about all tastes. If you have a sweet tooth, then do not even bother looking at the rest of the menu and immediately direct your attention to specialty pancake section. It is here where you will find some orgasmic offerings. Basically what you have here are huge and fluffy buttermilk pancakes that taste almost like cake (I am wondering what they add to the batter), and served up with some fantastic topping combinations that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The Oreo S&#39;mores version (pictured) is sensational, as well as the cinnamon roll pancakes. If you are more in the mood for fruit topped pancakes, I suggest you go with the Berry Bliss. It has a vanilla flavor to it, which is a needed contrast since the fruit topping is extremely tart. Yum! 

If you are especially hungry, go with one of the skillets as this hooks you up with a LOT of food. I have never been able to even come close to polishing one off. My favorite is the corned beef hash skillet which is topped with hashbrowns, cheese and eggs. Tell the waitress you would like the hashbrowns extra crispy and it adds some great texture to it as well. 

Rounding out my top 3 from Wildberry are the various Eggs Benedict combinations. They have gotten quite creative with flavors here on this timeless breakfast entree. The ridiculously unhealthy &#34;Southern&#34; is my favorite, which is essentially a marvelous rendition of biscuits and gravy. I am really only scratching the surface here on my reccomendations, as the menu at this place is quite long.

Wildberry does serve lunch items also, but I have never bothered with any of them. When I show up here I am in the mood for breakfast. Case closed. Prices are much more expensive than your typical breakfast joint, but then again, this is not friggin Denny&#39;s either. Really the only negative thing I can think of about this place is the hours. They close at 2:30 in the afternoon. So if you read this and have in the back of your mind that you just uncovered the ultimate late night drunk food stop in, you can put that potential epicness out of your mind right now. However, I can report it also does the trick for the next day when you are in recovery mode too. 

Bon Appétit"

The one complaint I had was the wait.  We were told 30 minutes and after 45 we were finally seated.  The waitress was very pleasant and helpful.  She gave us her thoughts on the dishes we inquired about.  Additionally, nothing against the people I was with, they can be difficult and she was more than happy to assist where she was able and offer a very nice experience.  By far, one of the best breakfast/brunch waitresses I have come across."

As I was passing through on my trip we stopped in for breakfast before checking out of our hotel room April 7th, 2016. I order the spicy Mexican style eggs benedicte along with fruit. I could barely eat all of my food for there was so much of it. My fruit was so fresh it was just plain heaven. The only thing I would do differently is add avacod to my benedicte otherwise it was the perfect meld of cheese and spices mixing with the food. Yum"

Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. 

We waited 40 minutes for a table, which went by quickly while I people watched and counted how many times a little girl threw a tantrum. I was tempted to get a coffee drink from the coffee bar counter at the front of the place, but I didn&#39;t want to be full before I even had any food. By the way, the to go coffee bar area is genius. Order a drink while you wait, Wildberry keeps racking in the dollars! 

So I ordered corned beef hash. It&#39;s one of my favorite breakfast items and I have to say, this was the best I&#39;ve ever had. I also splurged on my pancake side and upgrades to an Oreo S&#39;mores pancake. Seriously. It was ridiculous. Portions were big, and the prices were average, nothing outrageous.

Service was adequate, tables got cleaned off quickly. 

My only wish is that they took reservations so I didn&#39;t have to spend quality time with a screaming toddler. 

Can&#39;t wait to go back on a weekday when it isn&#39;t as busy!"

I&#39;ve been a few times but my most recent trip was last Sunday at 9am. At first I was hesitant to decide on Wildberry because of past experiences with the wait--but then again, there&#39;s a good reason for it!

We were seated within 10-15 minutes which was a great start! Our server was one of those people that you wonder &#34;what kind of drugs is she on?&#34; because she&#39;s was so dang happy waiting on people at a time when most others are still in bed. My friend and I ordered the Mexicana Skillet and the Espanola Omelette (which according to the waitress are the 2 most popular). Both were incredible so I&#39;d go with either one if you don&#39;t know what to order. The portions are big and everything is so tasty! My daughter ordered the Berry Bliss pancakes... I rarely want to taste something off of the kids menu but this was amazing! Huge portions for a 4 year old so we had a lot to take home.

Our bill was only about $30 which is a great value for the service, food &amp; overall experience."

They have a fantastic menu, and always allow us to make substitutions if we want to switch something out in an omelet. The omelets are fluffy, huge, and packed full of a great balance of ingredients. The berry bliss is our favorite style for both pancakes and crepes. The omelet breakfast is actually big enough for both of us to split and still be stuffed when we leave, so we just choose pancakes for our side, and pay the little bit extra to upgrade them to specialty pancakes to get our berry bliss fix, and we can get out of there surprisingly cheap for two people. 

The only reason I&#39;m giving this place four stars instead of five is that they have incredibly long wait times. We&#39;ve waited up to one and a half hours to be seated. They don&#39;t allow you to call ahead to reserve a place in line, either, so you have to stay in the vicinity while you wait. They do make this a bit easier by texting you when your table is ready and giving you five minutes (if I remember correctly) to claim your table. The wait isn&#39;t all that horrible for us since they share a parking lot with Costco, so we end up shopping while we wait. When the text comes, one of us runs to grab our table while the other finishes checking out. It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s a lot better than sitting around and twiddling our thumbs for an hour and a half, waiting for a table."

Our group of 8 went and after spending much time browsing thru photos here and reading reviews -- I was really expecting to be writing a 4 or 5 star review.

I was entirely disappointed. Prior to our outing, I looked at the menu online and decided I was leaning towards a waffle. So - I went with the glazed strawberries waffle. 

The strawberries were just too mushy, and the glaze just made the waffle all soggy. Even the waffle itself just didn&#39;t have good flavor. It tasted &#34;off&#34; -- in a way that I just can&#39;t explain.

I&#39;m guessing I just didn&#39;t order the *right* thing. The omelets some of my coworkers ordered looked much more appealing.

I did enjoy my blackberry lemonade. I&#39;m a sucker for lemonade, and they had fruit flavors not found elsewhere. 

I think I may bring my husband and kids here to try out -- and I&#39;ll just be sure to order something outside of the waffle area of the menu. Because I left there this morning so very disappointed."

I honestly didn&#39;t have too many high expectations, to be quite honest. I love breakfast places and I crave breakfast foods time and again, but it is just breakfast. Not &#39;just&#39; breakfast (it&#39;s the so-called important meal of the day, after all!) but there are only so many things you can eat... or more specifically, I can eat. Quick background: I&#39;m vegetarian, but also don&#39;t consume onions, garlic, leeks, chives, or anything else in that lovely family. 

However, this place seemed local and I do love trying local things when traveling. We got there at around 8:45 AM or so. There was no line but the place was already filled up to around 70%. We were greeted by two ladies and lead up to a large booth by the waiter station. Didn&#39;t bother me much since it was located in a corner of sorts so I could people watch. Then it occurred to me: it&#39;s Monday and should be commute-to-work time... why were there so many people?? It simply amazed me how popular this place was and according to the reviews, it was bound to get busier.

Our waiter was really nice and helpful when he came by a couple of minutes after we were seated. Sorry, forgot his name but he looked like someone I know (who is currently living abroad so I know they&#39;re not one and the same). We asked him what we could eat (sadly, not the hash browns). We tried to order the Fresca Omelette and the Signature Berry Bliss Waffle. Then he told us we could just get the omelette and then add on the waffle as a side for just $3 instead of the $10.25 we would have paid just for the waffle (I&#39;m hoping it also comes with its own sides with that price). That&#39;s what we ended up going with... so we had the omelette with a side of fruit and the waffle. 

IT WAS AN AWESOME DEAL. We were pretty content afterwards.

The omelette was like an omelette I had never seen or had before. The way it was made, the ingredients were folded into the egg and there was a good amount of avocado in it. My husband loved it (saying it was less greasy than IHOP, this breakfast chain we have in abundance of down south), which is saying something since he&#39;ll eat anything as long as it&#39;s edible and vegetarian and never looks anything other than indifferent when I ask him if he liked something and he&#39;d do a half shrug and say something generic like, &#34;It was nice.&#34; I really enjoyed my omelette. A lot. 

The waffle was a legit-sized waffle (see photo) and it was nice and fluffy. They said it would be topped with berry mascarpone and I really think they actually use real mascarpone. It was full topped with fresh berries that were just so juicy and cute and was the perfect (and indulgent) side to a savory breakfast. 

I would totally come back again if I ever had the chance and I might just get the exact same thing. I&#39;d probably try something new if I could, but some of the other items I was interested in were off limits. Also: a special thank you to that waiter for letting us know we could just add a special waffle for just $3 extra!"

My friend&#39;s favorite thing to order at breakfast places is the hash and he approved

I had a rather large group for breakfast, there were 7 of us, on a Sunday. We were seated in a section kind of off to the side, assuming that was the section customers with kids go (we had 2 and noticed people around us had kids too).

Our server was one of the best Ive ever had, I wish I would have gotten her name. She had brown hair in a ponytail and had green eyes (maybe hazel?) Our server was very attentive, patient, and sweet. 

When our meal came the presentation was great, my &#34;Mexicana Skillet&#34; came in an actual skillet :)

The food was delicious!! The hash browns were perfectly crisp, my eggs were scrambled. It came with toast and they served it with preserves. yummmm!! After I left I was full for the rest of the day. I will definitely be back and will make sure to be there super early to fight the morning rush"

Impeccably nice and attentive service? Yes. Fresh fruit and vanilla anglaise on their signature berry bliss entrees? Heck yes. Short waiting time? Sadly, no, but I felt that the wait (30+ minutes) was well worth it. There are plenty of chairs inside and outside of the restaurant and there are convenient buzzers for when your party is ready to be seated. 

I ordered the signature berry bliss crepes and the florence eggs benedict and despite being almost completely different flavor profiles, both were equally delicious and fresh. The chefs really know how to season their food here and it shows in how the ingredients compliment each other well in each entree!

Our server was Kim... straight to the point and very friendly. 

I was amazed at how quickly we got our food. I ordered the mocha coconut latte (delicious, not overly sweet which is what i was afraid of - as with the other food I ordered) which came out in a minute or so.

Together we both ordered two sides of hashbrowns (crazy good), bacon (he enjoyed it.. three huge pieces for a small price), i got the wild berry pancakes (the fruits on top were ripe which added a great touch) and he was wow&#39;d by the chocolate chip pancakes. This was all at our table within five minutes... served warm and each dish was beyond acceptable.

All in all... definitely would come again. There honestly was not one thing to pick at."

I ordered the espanola skillet snd substituted speciality berry bliss crepes for only $1 more. I love how you can have both savory and sweet and both dishes are amazing. Huge portions at a reasonable price -I almost always have leftovers to take home.

Highly recommend for anyone looking for a good brunch spot!"

This was my first time here after hearing great things about this place. I walked in with high expectations. Then It deflated quickly after engaging with the two ladies at the coffee bar. The attitude from both of these two ladies was sour.  We settled in for the 1.45 hour wait.  Still being hopeful that this wait and aggravation was going to be worth it. Our meals arrived in a timely fashion while the busboy was standing in the corner twirling the bus pan on his finger tips like a basket ball. The meals were tasty but I am hard pressed to come back and spend this kinda money again knowing I can go to IHOP for something as good.

Unless you make it Mexican or make it taste like dessert AND hide the breakfast-y parts of it.  Yes, I&#39;m a child.  I hate vegetables too while we&#39;re at it.  

Anyway, besides the shared with Costco parking lot (THE WORST) and the ungodly wait you have to endure to eat here (Yep, hate that too...though they have a really nice patio and a decent sized lobby to hang out at/in while you wait), this place is where it&#39;s at.

I&#39;m happy to report that the breakfast burrito here is probably the best one I&#39;ve ever had.  And I&#39;ve eaten a lot of breakfast burritos.  It&#39;s my go-to if I have to eat before 11:00 and for some reason places are refusing to serve me lunch.  It also hid mostly anything that would be considered breakfast-y (Eggs, I&#39;m mostly looking at you...Sausage? You&#39;re cool.) with delicious meats and cheeses and sauces.  The hash browns that came with the gigantic burrito were legit too...nice and perfectly golden brown.  Mmmmmm.  I ALMOST got one of their dessert-y sounding french toasts because that list sounded pretty tempting too, but I&#39;m glad I stuck with the old tried and true.  Breakfast burrito?  You my only breakfast friend.    

I usually don&#39;t care about atmosphere as long as the food is good but I will say that this place was solid there too.  No nasty sticky old tables here or kitschy apples or roosters.  No sir.  This place is for the fancy breakfasters who like their breakfast served in a clean and pretty environment.  That may just have to be a breakfast deal breaker for me from now on.       

Point is, if you can make ME like your breakfast foods, you can probably make anyone like them.  Check this place out.  Just get there insanely early."

I&#39;m definitely a breakfast kind of person. I could have breakfast at any time of the day.

Friday morning I had the Espanola Omelette,  hash browns, sub speciality pancakes wildberry bliss, and the mint mocha latte. It was all sooooo gooood! The first time I went to Wildberry&#39;s I had the Mexicana Skillet and the Espanola omelette is similar but I preferred the skillet of the omelette. 

Today, I had The Ventian skillet wth avocado, turtle mocha mint latte, and sub speciality pancakes banana creme pie.
Again, everything was sooooo good to me! 

A few tips when going to Wildberry&#39;s: 
1. It&#39;s most likely going to be busy, so come earlier or be prepared to wait. Parking lot can get packed. (But.... I promise you it&#39;s totally worth the wait)
2. Given that it&#39;ll be busy, take a menu to look at while you wait! It cuts your waiting time if you decide before you sit down."

Great food and good service. You probably can&#39;t go wrong with anything you order and they have so many delicious options. 

Took my parents out to eat here for their anniversary. My dad order the banana crunch yogurt special. It was very good. My mom got eggs with bacon and a side of the berry bliss crepe as a sub for toast or pancakes. It&#39;s just 1 crepe instead of 3 for the entree. I ordered the Rutherford Omlette, which is filled with spinach, goat cheese, and bacon. Huge but amazing. I got the side of multi grain toast and hashbrowns. Excellent.

This is a 5 star, must try restaurant!"

With 719 or so reviews makes it the most reviewed in Schaumburg area, we pretty much had to go. 

The biggest hurdle of this restaurant seems to be it&#39;s popularity. We arrived around 11 am on a Sunday so the perfect time for EVERYONE to go out for brunch. The parking lot is shared with Costco and a handful of other restaurants makes for a hard time finding a parking spot. We found one that was more so in the Costco parking lot than the Wildberry cafe, but it worked anyway. We got there, and there was a 45 minute wait. Ugh. Well, I ordered a latte and we sat outside to wait. The benefit to having a little coffee bar on the inside..for the wait.

When we were finally seated, I ordered a coffee and the Napa Valley fig omelette. It was delicious, but it was made with dried figs. Still good, but I would have preferred fresh figs. It is the season, after all. I realize that it is not always the season, so I get it. My husband had their signature pancakes and enjoyed them as well.

Four stars instead of five for the crazy wait time and problems finding parking. Also, it was a bit noisy inside since the whole restaurant is basically in one room. Otherwise, great restaurant!"

After a short 10 minute wait for a table on a busy Tuesday, me and my daughter were seated. The worst thing that I can say about this place is that the water was kind of disgusting. Idk maybe it was recycled. 
We ordered a Butcher Block Skillet not knowing what to expect. Sausage at certain chain restaurants always taste funky and make me sick. This skillet is filed with 3 types of sausage, so I had triple the anxiety over breakfast. With that I upgraded the pancakes to their signature Berry Bliss, this was NOT a mistake. 
All that I can say is that I&#39;ve never had such good chicken or turkey sausage before in my life. Not saying that I&#39;ve had a lot, or any fire that matter, but these are by far the best. The entire skillet was awesome and the Berry Bliss pancakes are worth writing home about. 
The prices are comparable for the area but the taste fat outshines the rest."

I had a late lunch here on 3/14/16, I had the Denver skillet with pancakes. About 4 hours after leaving I got VERY VERY sick. I was sick until noon the following day.  I called to speak to the manager to let them know I became ill.  The manager (a male who didn&#39;t give his name and I didn&#39;t ask for it because of his demeanor) immediately told me that food poisoning takes 24 hours to manifest and I couldn&#39;t have gotten sick from their food. He told me I probably got sick from something I ate the previous day.  He finished the conversation telling me that he hopes I feel better soon. What a great guy. 

I understand that this is a very busy restaurant and losing one customer means little to nothing to them.  But to get on the phone and tell me that I didn&#39;t get sick from their food and it was from something else is wrong. Well done Mr. Manager, keep up this good work and maybe your restaurant will become less and less busy."

Luckily we called in our brunch order to-go at Wildberry Cafe in Schaumburg, because when we arrived on a Sunday morning there had to have been 100 people milling about outside waiting for tables in the already-large interior. They had our food ready to roll, so kudos to for that. 

At Wildberry Cafe you&#39;re in for huge-mongous portions of whatever you order, all of which is good-not-great food. They have standard to interesting offerings, but it&#39;s all like a sanitized version obviously tailored to please as many suburban palates as possible. My Breakfast Burrito ($9.75) was passable but unremarkable, filling but unsatisfying. 

It&#39;s hard to argue with the portions and the prices, and obviously Wildberry Cafe is a popular place catering to the right audience, but I was less than impressed."

Nothing too long - maybe 20 minutes or so, but I was surprised to wait at all.

The inside of the restaurant is very cute - made to look rustic. We were seated at a table and the one knock is that it was kind of cramped. My chair was bumped just about every time someone needed to squeeze by.

Everything else was wonderful. Our server was kind and helpful. She really knew the menu. I ordered an omelette (and ended up taking half of it home because it was so huge!). It came with pancakes, and I spent the extra $1 to make them blueberry. 100% worth it. My husband had the side cinnamon roll pancakes, and those were good too.

Few Tips!
-Always best with a large group. Well, if you have patience to wait up to an hour on a weekend morning. Maybe not best for grandparents. 
-Go ahead and order the coffee at the coffee bar. It&#39;ll make it easier to pass time by. Then you can change it up and get a mix of their delicious lemonades once you sit. 
-SHARE! I love ordering a sweet french toast or pancakes at the table and then spitting omelettes with my husband. We went with a group of 8 people and we all shared. 
-BEST SERVICE. Please tip 20 percent- they deserve it. Plus they are so nice. 
-If you come around 12, sit at 1, hang till 3, that&#39;s the best!"

Sure the wait is long but in the summer time they have tables and chairs for people to sit and wait. If you are in a hurry then I don&#39;t suggest going here but if you want a great breakfast then suck it up, wait 45 minutes and you&#39;ll have amazing food.

The interior is very clean. No doubt about that. 

The pop machine is like this futuristic machine that has hundreds of options.

Food was well prepared. Good portions and lots of options.

Pretty much I personally think it&#39;s a Chipotle on steroids. 

The only negative is that it is expensive. 10.00 plus for a ground beef burrito and pop is the only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars. They should lower it to 8.00 for what we get.

I still prefer this place over Chipotle though so far."

It bothers me that I never see any of the meat actually cooking on the grill, and that it comes from the back in little containers. 
All the workers I&#39;ve encountered there are awesomely nice. I enjoy the great service provided by them.
Overall, I can get a much tastier burrito from Chipotle for a little bit cheaper than I can here. Too bad, because it had potential."

Qdoba may have just won my business from Chiptole. Friendly staff, good portions, fresh food is that too hard to ask for. Qdoba had it all during this visit. Super friendly staff taking orders, good portion size. Didn&#39;t have to ask can you give me more rice, cheese, etc. Food was fresh and delicious. I will be back. The steak taco bowl was a piece of art, well balance protein with lettuce and cheese. 

Pro: friendly staff, good portions

Cons: the steak marinate is still not as good as chiptole, but overall the experience I think was better

I didn&#39;t think it was going to be this good, but now I understand why my sister said &#34;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve got&#34; when I told her one was opening up by me.  I see the light!!

I love all of the options--it&#39;s very Chipotle-like in the setup, but with MORE options and Qdoba&#39;s ingredients are much more fresh.  I LOVED their queso sauce.

I chose to really go all out.  I got three steak tacos with lots of toppings (all of which were amazing), and the &#34;Pick Two&#34; option, which is SUCH a good idea (somewhere that rhymes with Shmipotle should take some notes on that, nudge nudge).  

The &#34;Craft 2&#34; that I chose was:
Nachos-Pinto Beans, Chicken, Queso, Lettuce, and Sour Cream
Naked Burrito (no tortilla)--Cilantro Lime Rice, Steak, Ranchera Sauce, Cheese, Sour Cream, and Grilled Veggies (extra charge)

My friend also got a Craft 2, so we had two meals plus a whole different other meal of tacos!

Oh, and I got a cookie.  Always a cookie!

My total would have been $23, but I had a BOGO coupon that had been mailed to me (smart, guys!).  So our total for three meals and a cookie was around $17.  Not bad AT ALL (especially since a couple days before that, I spent $23 on two U Pick 2&#39;s, a drink, and a cookie from a place that rhymes with Shmanera...just saying...)

Everything was really fresh and fast--it&#39;s not &#34;authentic Mexican, but it&#39;s a (very important) step up from Taco Bell--and I&#39;m not hating--I love me some TB!!  The customer service at Qdoba was amazing and they were really efficient, even with my three separate orders!  I will definitely be back for the great food, accomodating service, and (most importantly) the delicious food."

I went because i had a bogo 50% off coupon that i received from gamestop. I ordered the queso nachos with chicken and beef soft tacos. The ground beef ran out so i had to wait quite a bit for the tacos, In the meantime my nachos were getting soggy. The employee did apologize for the wait and gave me a free soda. I couldn&#39;t wait to try my nachos because Chipotle doesnt offer nachos. The nachos were so yummy even though they were soggy. My mother said the tacos were incredible.  I would have given more stars but due to wait I give them 3. I will gladly return again. 

Given that i had to wait, I was able to observe the staff. Staff were very upbeat and helpful but one girl on the food line did not remove her gloves after taking money and using the cash register before she started on the food line again. Thank goodness she did not touch my food. That is my only complaint."

I had high hopes for what I read as the &#34;best pizza in Schaumburg,&#34; alas I left fairly disappointed. Allow me to share the yays and nays...

Yays:
-The thin crust pizza was pretty solid. A nice crispy crust, toasty cheese mix and nicely scattered veggies
-Pretty affordable overall
-They also host a variety of items on the menus, ranging from sandwiches to salads and there&#39;s also a small case of Italian cookies near the front

Nays:
-Employees were aloof at best - this is an order at the counter, then wait kind of place and despite being the only people in the restaurant, we had to go back and forth to the counter 4 times for our food, napkins, plates, and our drinks. 
-The flimsiest Styrofoam plates on earth (horrible for the environment, horrible for holding searing hot pizza) 
-Ravioli tasted incredibly plain, tasteless, and was likely frozen for a very long time before it was warmed up in an overly sweet sauce 
-A pizza place with two restroom stalls and not one single place to change a baby&#39;s diaper. This isn&#39;t a bar or an upscale restaurant, people often bring their children out to eat, it&#39;d be appreciated by many a patron to spend the $200 to install a changing table. 

Overall, it&#39;s a bare bones establishment where you can grab some decent pizza. Other than that, I wouldn&#39;t recommend Little Sicily the way it stands...I think they can do much better with a bit of effort."

Get the Baked Clams.. Home-made but might have been frozen prior to serving.. still good.. does have a bit much of bread crumbs however its a meaty

Ordered thin crust with mushroom, sausage, onion and green pepper. Pizza was a bit under cooked in the center. Veggies are diced, so they don&#39;t properly cook. Mushrooms were nonexistent. Calamari was not fresh. It looked like Burger King onion rings and was almost all breading. The biggest disappointment was the chicken wings. 
The frozen pre cooked wings were warmed up in a pizza ,burnt black on the ends, super greasy, without sauce and pretty much inedible. Extremely pricy for such poor quality food. I was very shocked that a restaurant that offered fresh baked items put such little effort into the quality of their other food. Maybe if I ordered a pizza with different ingredients I may like it more, but the appetizers are a complete waste of money."

You might ask yourselves: jeez, Gemma has eaten a lot of pizza in her time; sheesh, Gemma makes her own gravy; holy cannoli, Gemma knows where from her pizza cometh.

Well, on a casual night with family and friends one of the best thin crust pizzas with simple toppings of only Italian sausage and green pepper was placed before me. 

What did I discover? Sometimes less is truly more. Sometimes, when you least expect you find a grease-less thin crust that my mother&#39;s mother would throw herself on the ground for.

What else? A smooth perfect gravy/sauce made by someone reincarnated from my grandfather. 

And? At this little unpretentious spot no need to throw everything but the kitchen sink on top of your pizza. Toppings are plentiful and cover your entire pizza.

My cousin ordered one of their specialty paninis and though she wouldn&#39;t share it smelled awesome. The Red Pepper Parm is also simply prepared with emphasis on quality flavors: great bread, red pepper, and Parmesan. 

Take a peek at their carry out menu; it is huge. They also have Italian cookies on hand that looked as perfect as their pizza. I suspect they fly off the shelves too.

To leave me speechless and utterly satiated is a tall order for even the most stalwart of my countrymen. All I gotta say about Little Sicily is: Semplicemente il meglio! Simply the best!"

The toppings on the thin crust pizza were sausage and Canadian bacon. Green pepper, black olives, and pepperoni were on the double dough pizza. Little Sicily charges fifty cents for each extra ingredient added to the pizza. Both pizzas were flavorful, fresh, and ready for pickup after twenty minutes. 

Little Sicily offers thin crust, pan, stuffed, and double dough pizzas. The thin crust is crispy on the ends and fairly soft (not soggy) in the middle. For those who enjoy a thicker, chewier option, I recommend the double dough. The double dough pizza I ordered was chewy but not tough and very fresh. The ingredients on both pizzas were of a good quality. In particular, I thought the Canadian bacon had a very meaty, sharp taste. 

Little Sicily is unique in that it is also a bakery. We found the baked goods fresh and sweet but not overpowering. I recommend ordering a pizza and a freshly baked dessert from Little Sicily."

They were my first meal when I moved into my house over 2 years ago and we live right near by. They have rarely disappointed us. They have a sweeter pizza sauce than other places and a yummy crust. You can also try their bakery but get their early, because the options decrease throughout the day. Grab a sandwich from their large variety of options, order some apps to share or get a salad if you&#39;re watching the calories. 

We like to order a thin crust with double sausage which sometimes, you actually get double sausage and sometimes, there is hardly one portion. Perhaps it&#39;s because they know I don&#39;t need the calories, but then I would like them not to charge me for it.  What are ya gonna do though? They still rock.

If you are looking for a steak sandwich, you can count on these guys and they put fried onions on top which I skip but my sister LOVES them.

This is defffffinltely our great find....  Fantastic pizza with really great sauce. I&#39;m not even a huge red sauce person and i absolutely love this sauce.  I don&#39;t know what they have in their sauce, but it is just so amazingly flavorful!   We typically get the Little Sicily special....their sausage is great!  Enough of that great fennel sausage flavor in it!  On the side, we really enjoy their fried zucchini which comes with a little mini tub of their amazing sauce to dip your zucchini into."

I&#39;m a huge critic of pizza sauce and thats something i look for whenever i try a new pizza. they use really good sauce, i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s homemade or bought (i&#39;m guessing it&#39;s homemade), but it&#39;s really good. And they always put lots of sauce on which i like. They have tons of different toppings for their pizzas as well as different types of pizzas. I prefer the regular thin crust or the stuffed pizzas yumm. You never have to wait very long for your pizzas and they have always gotten our orders right. One of their appetizers that i tend to get sometimes over the pizza is the panzarotti cuz it&#39;s really good too. They also make a lot of deserts, one of my favorite being the eclair. I suggest not to pass those up either.

I would say that their prices are average for a pizza place, but when you start going there they staple little sicily dollars that you can use when you order food from them."

We&#39;ve happily ordered delivery from Little Sicily many times but when I went in for pickup tonight I had the quintessential bad customer service experience.  When I arrived, although they said the pizza was almost ready, they had completely forgot to make my pizza.  I proceeded to wait another 20 minutes after before deciding to take my place at the back of a line of five other customers.  There was one girl helping customers.  While I could tell she was trying, the pace was very slow.  Everyone was waiting a long time while some greaseball that was working there is leaning on the counter doodling on a notepad the whole time.

So I get the food home and again pizza was good.  We&#39;d also ordered a large tossed salad which consisted of soaking wet iceberg lettuce, 2 small slices of under-ripe tomato and a few shavings of carrot.  We decided the salad was only fit for our garbage can.  

If they forgot the pizza or didn&#39;t have decent salads available thats OK.  They could have said &#34;We&#39;re out of salads can I offer you something else?&#34;  or &#34;We forgot your pizza, I&#39;m sorry, have some cookies on the house.&#34;  But instead they made me wait forever and sold me a bad salad.  Won&#39;t be doing business with them again."

I was enticed by all the positive Yelp reviews of this quaint, no frills, byob, Mexican restaurant.  I had the Carne Tampiquena based on a number of recommendations by our waitress Alex and my niece had the Chicken Flautas.  As stated in many of the Yelp reviews, the dinner was preceded by tortilla chips and a flavorful, spicy salsa.  I could eat Mexican food every night.  Both my niece and I enjoyed our meals and I was thrilled to be able to bring my favorite beer to accompany my meal.  It was good Mexican food and I would definitely go again.  Our waitress Alex was a joy, so friendly and helpful and she even came after me with my bottle opener when I tried to leave it behind on our table.

I think online reviews can be very helpful, especially when they are measured and accurate.  Sometimes it can be hard to determine which reviews reflect these parameters.  There is a review from 1-15-2016 about this restaurant and the reviewer claims they spent &#34;about $80 on dinner&#34; for two and they had the Parillada Montecasino and Chori Fondido (Chori Queso, same thing).

This restaurant has very reasonable prices.  The Parillada Montecasino is for two people and costs $32.50.  The Chori Fondido is $8.75.  Makes me wonder about the reviewer&#39;s math, the overall amount I came up with, even allowing for two orders of Chori Fondido totaled $50.00, before tax.............There&#39;s nothing wrong with writing a tough review, but it is only fair to be accurate when quoting prices.  People do factor in price when they choose a restaurant."

I eat a primarily whole-food plant based diet so Mexican food is a staple for most vegans due to the array of options. As everyone else said DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER bc this is truly a hidden gem and worth going 15-20 minutes out of your way to eat here. My mom and I sat down and the friendly waitress welcomed us and brought us our free basket of chips and salsa. At first I was saddened bc I love spicy foods and she brought the green salsa (which many ppl on yelp said was mild). Well boy was I surprised when I took a heaping scoop on my first chip. It was quite spicy  and sooo delicious!! Then, we ordered a small guacamole which was worth the trip alone. YUM! Super fresh and very rich. For our main course we ordered the veggie tacos and vegetarian fajitas (an off menu item, but they will make it at your request). We mixed the corn and flour tortillas and enjoyed every bit of our meal. Food was fresh, made to order and BOMBDOTCOM!

This little hole-in-the-wall is ALL about the food. Don&#39;t go here expecting ambiance or amazing service. Interior is basic, service is friendly.

We started out with complimentary chips and salsa... the chips were standard, the green salsa was finger lickin&#39; good!

Skipped appetizers and went straight to entrees. I had the Steak and Rajas con Crema. WOW. It&#39;s a steak covered in a mouthwatering concoction of poblano peppers, onions, cheese, sour cream, all cooked together with spices.  Uh-maze-ing. The rice and beans are a delicious complement. This dish is one of my new favorite dishes. 

My sister had the Devil Shrimp, grilled shrimp smothered in chipotle sauce, served with rice and salad. Also delicious, but I felt the chipotle sauce overpowered the flavor of the shrimp. 

For dessert we shared a slice of flan. Fantastic flavor, a tiny bit too firm for my liking.  But still a great dessert. 

I absolutely recommend Montecasino for anyone on search of delicious food!"

I would have never picked this place out had it not been for some friends that live nearby and discovered it. The white cursive letters on their front make it look like a hookah place or Mediterranean or something.

But the food... So SO awesome! Marinated in wonderful spices and sauce, the chicken and beef shouts flavor. And pair it with a fresh soft corn taco and the p cilantro and onions, it&#39;s classic wonderful Mexican on a plate! Also, TRY THE GUACAMOLE. Easily some of the best guacamole I&#39;ve ever had: fresh delicious avocado, onions, tomatoes, green peppers, cilantro. I loved all the crunchy stuff in there that boosted its wonderful flavor.

My husband and I stopped in here early on a Friday evening. A few tables were filled. We grabbed a table and were greeted promptly with a bowl of chips and green salsa. They were both delicious. We ordered chicken tacos with green mole and chicken enchiladas with red mole. 

I was very curious about the green mole since I had never tried it before. Both items were delicious. So much flavor. The green was spicy, the red sweet. The quality was spectacular. If I had to pick between the green or red mole, I wouldn&#39;t be able to. They are both fantastic! We also took a slice of the flan to have later in the evening. It had a lovely flavor and smooth texture. 

Our meal here was so wonderful, we are considering going back again within the same week. That is unheard of for us. I know this spot isn&#39;t attractive from the outside... don&#39;t judge it by it&#39;s cover. The food is incredible and the service is warm and friendly."

A rather nondescript looking building that shares a space with a liquor store near the Metra station in Villa Park. Once when driving by I made a mental note to look up this place on Yelp to see what it was about. Upon looking it up, I was surprised at all of the five star reviews posted about it so I had to check it out.
Stopped by on a Friday and found it fairly crowded (it&#39;s small inside) with people. Atmosphere is surely lacking. Kind of scruffy if you ask me.
They had one young waitress working that was running around so much I felt sorry for her. She could have used some help for sure.
Here is what we ordered. Shrimp tacos and Carne tampequina, and a horchata.
The waitress brought us some chips and salsa along with water and the horchata. As for the horchata, I did not really like it and think it was made with a mix since the bottom of the glass seemed to be quite grainy.
 The salsa was ok but here is the thing with the chips. They are not made in house. From where I was sitting, I could see into their back room and I saw all of the bags of chips sitting on a rack. I find this very strange that they do not make their own. Its not that they were terrible or anything but they were not made on the premises.
As for the meals ordered, only ok. The tacos had a chipoltle sauce which fought with the shrimp. If ordered again I would recommend their sauce on the side.
As for the steak, it was thin, very thin. Very salty. For almost 17 bucks, it should have been much better. However, I do not want to slam all of their food. The enchilada that came with the steak was excellent. Their rice and their beans were also very good.
I&#39;m amazed about all of the five star reviews. I really can&#39;t understand it. Plus, the prices are not a bargain here either. In my book to get a five star review the meal has to be exceptional or have great service or great atmosphere or a combination of at least two of these or food so good you don&#39;t care about anything else. This did not qualify in my book.

Cheers to all"

I was a little disappointed to have a much less than a 4-5 star experience based on other yelp reviews. I ordered the big steak quesadilla &amp; my wife had enchiladas.

It&#39;s terribly cramped on the inside. True, I believe this is just a small space but I believe the way they had the scheme setup made it even smaller so while we waited FOREVER for our meal, we had to sit in a corner.

So on to the food. The &#34;big&#34; quesadilla was pretty normal sized to me. Additionally, I didn&#39;t have any sour creme or anything on the side which is pretty standard for most authentic Mexican restaurants. I could&#39;ve went to Taco Bell for the same thing for $5. My wife was also missing an Enchilada. She was supposed to have 3 but had 2.

I only gave 2 stars because my food was thoroughly cooked. However, I&#39;m not really a fan of this place."

Starting with the chips and salsa, the meal was incredible. Both salsas had a ton of flavor and bite. As for my entrée, they might have the best mole I&#39;ve had outside of Mexico! This includes Bayless restaurants and ethnic joints in Pilsen and Little Village. The balance between sweet and spice is perfect, with the spice hitting you at the end. Great presentation - the enchiladas were cooked just right. 

Also, the place is BYOB! How many places in the burbs are BYOB?! Maybe more have opened since I&#39;ve moved to the city four years go, but I haven&#39;t found them. When I&#39;m visiting my parents again, we&#39;ll be sure to come here instead of the monotonous chains."

Montecasino proves the rule.

From the outside, it looks terrible.  Even the font on the sign doesn&#39;t make sense.  It seems to be a Mediterranean place.

Inside, it&#39;s not much to look at.  A few booths, a few tables, standard industrial seating.  Pretty cramped.

But the food is awesome.

Let&#39;s start with the chips and salsa.  The green salsa has a nice kick, but the red is super crazy spicy.  I loved it.

My group also ordered the queso, which was nice and creamy (and was enhanced by a splash of that salsa, too).

For dinner, I went with the chicken enchiladas.  Tasty and cheap.

Service wasn&#39;t great.  Could be that we were the last table of the night.  At one point, the staff sat down to eat while we were still in the restaurant.  Things got a little awkward when we had to interrupt their dinner to ask for our check.

It is BYOB and there&#39;s a well-stocked (and friendly) liquor store next door.  That helps keep the cost down.

If you&#39;re in the neighborhood, stop by and enjoy some quality Mexican grub on the cheap."

I live so close I can&#39;t believe I don&#39;t come here more often. I SHOULD!!!

My only complaint and it&#39;s my own personal preference is that the horchata tasted like it is flavored with red hotts cinnamon candies. I have heard but not yet confirmed that this is due to the usage of cinnamon oil vs real cinnamon. Although I didn&#39;t enjoy their horchata, everything else I have ordered or tasted here was phenomenal.

This is a BYOB establishment but there is a liquor store next door that has what you&#39;re looking for.

It&#39;s a good place for a bite before heading to the city or just getting back as its nearly on top of the Villa Park Metra on Ardmore.

As I&#39;m telling the manager, he proceeds to tell me that there was no cilantro. Accusing me of lying, and furthermore getting agitated by telling me that if the cost of certain vegetables go up, he won&#39;t include them. The veggie taco dinner is about $10, and I have never complained about prices. He goes onto say that he is out of yellow squash and it&#39;s too expensive right now, so there will not be any on my veggie tacos.

The few times I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve gotten the chicken tacos (with &amp; without green mole) &amp; steak tacos. Both were delicious but surprisingly I prefer their chicken over steak. Dine-in and you get free chips and salsa...salsa tastes great on your food as well. The black beans and rice are really good, and I&#39;m not even big on black beans. My husband gets the chicken fajitas &amp; loves it. 
I&#39;ve never brought my own beverage but I know that&#39;s a big plus for some. The liquor store next door is super convenient. 
Finding a good authentic Mexican spot in this area isn&#39;t easy to come across. I&#39;m telling you, come to Montecasino and you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

I got the taco dinner w/ green mole. It came with rice and black beans. Black beans were yummy, and the rice was just right.
The quality of the meat was good - and you can mix what kind of meat on each taco. I wish it came with more rice. So glad it&#39;s not refried beans. Healthier Mexican food was such a plus! 

The MOLE is not guacamole, ask your waitress and she&#39;ll explain what&#39;s in the red vs green. The red one had chocolate in it, so I went with the green. It was good but different.

I&#39;ll never go to los burrito again, QUALITY over quantity. This place is a hidden gem

Rated 4 stars for the SLOW service, and they didn&#39;t serve seltzer water. Prices are a little hiked too. 

The BYOB atmosphere is pretty rad - reminds me of Chicago. It&#39;s a small place but lots of groups came in and combined tables together. Went on a Friday night."

So, like... this place was kind of awesome. And we never would have found it, if it weren&#39;t for Yelp.

We&#39;ve been on a taco binge.. eating taco&#39;s of all types all over the western suburbs.. even some with small amounts of mole sauce.

But we haven&#39;t been able to find a great dark red/brown mole sauce as a featured item anywhere.

We took our 1 year old grandson here (very accommodating) who was in a mood and made a mess all over the place. We got there at 5:00 on a Saturday and they weren&#39;t busy yet... but that changed as we ate. 

It&#39;s BYOB and there is a fairly decent liquor establishment next door. I picked up a bottle of Menage a Trois merlot, which seemed just about right for the meal except that I was drinking Diet Coke.. so maybe I should have looked for a Menage a Un? 

I don&#39;t think they charged us a corkage fee.. if they did, it was cheap. Because our total bill was under $32.00

Chips served with a delicious green salsa to start out.

I was really occupied with the whole mole idea and never explored whether there are other salsa/ hot sauce options. Shame on me, that&#39;s a &#34;hot&#34; button for me.. so to speak...

Lisa ordered the Chicken Enchiladas with the dark Mole (they call it red, but it&#39;s pretty brown) and the presentation in toto was excellent. As was the mole.. Lisa loves mole sauce and we have been on the prowl for a good one, this is it.

I ordered the Carnitas Enchiladas which amazingly, looked exactly like Lisa&#39;s! (see pictures) 

The mole sauce was almost perfect. A true mole (like this) is almost too thick to be considered a sauce and this was rich and thick, really, really delicious. I say almost perfect, because I like when there is a trace of bitterness in the sauce.

The dinners came with rice and refried black beans..and they did both of them right.... yum.

I also ordered a Carne Asada (Steak) taco, mexican style (to keep with my current fixation) and it was excellent at $1.99.. although, it was kind of a smaller tortilla.. not full size.

At the owners suggestion, I also ordered a chicken taco with green mole (I&#39;ve never tried green mole before) The mole was also delicious but was so thick that it kind of overwhelmed the chicken... I would try this again on a larger portion meal.. like enchiladas. The taco was very good, it just wasn&#39;t the ideal application for my introduction to the sauce.

Montecasino is a terrific find, worthy of five stars for service, quality, originality and value.

We&#39;ll be back. A lot."

We went for dinner with on of our kids on a Saturday night. Full house full of happy people. Owner greeted us and took orders. BYOB which we read ahead so we knew to bring some mexican branded beers but there is a store right next store that could help as well! 
We ate the fresh salsa with chips as we waited. Our daughter had a generous plate of nachos with flavorful ground beef, black beans, cheese etc. The home made foods made this a heavenly dish. The generous portion went home and made it to the next day too! I chose the shrimp taco plate so I could try the rice and beans that have been raved about. The shrimp were brined in some spices but not over done and very tasty.  Rice and black beans were for the side portions amazing to taste!   My partner chose two steak tacos Mexican style to experience them the way the owner said is best. They were! He also ate a portion of the nachos.  I am look forward to going back and trying enchiladas.  I do not see us trying the burgers etc because why bother with such great food such as this? Also, plenty of places to sample that somewhere else. 

The place had a full house and we still had excellent service, great food made to order and all fresh tasting.  We were stuffed so we did not check out any dessert options.  Looking forward to going again."

All the food we had was just a pinch different then standard Mexican food. It was all outstanding. I ordered steak enchilada with green sauce, rice and black beans. The enchiladas were spectacular. Steak that was tasty and tender. Love the Mexican black beans. The Spanish rice, which I normally take one taste and push it aside. Not here. Ate it all. What a great taste!

They had a lovely jazz mix playing, salsa verde was outstanding and the guacamole was good. We had tacos - the pork was surprisingly my favorite. The hub preferred the beef and neither of us were over joyed with the chicken, but that&#39;s probably because we don&#39;t really like chicken. 

Rice and beans were well above average and the portions were ample.

Montecasino has a phenomenal vegatarian burrito and tacos options, fantastic hamburgers, and amazing breakfast choice, the delightful Monte Rancheros. Their fajitas are so good, the guacamole is always fresh, the salsa is perfect ...I can&#39;t rave enough.

Maybe some local folk musician can plug in an amp, and this would just become the hot spot in VP. 

For those who complain about slow service, well this isn&#39;t a fast food Tex-Mex restaurant. Don&#39;t be confused by its location in a strip mall with a small neon sign, this is fine dining quality to me. And I&#39;ll consider it as one of the best in this area."

So far I&#39;ve had the Nachos with chicken and steak (amazing), Chori Queso which is piping hot, smooth and salty, all Tacos (ground beef and chicken are my favorite), and the Tortilla Soup (packed up to go and had it for 2 weekday lunches).

One note, it is BYOB. There are 2 places nearby to buy alcohol, in case your forget or didn&#39;t see this note before you arrived.  

For those who are gluten-free, everything I have asked about and eaten is GF. I have never had an issue and will append this review if I ever do."

I phoned in my order and got the three taco dinner with steak chicken and beef tacos.  The owner greater my when I walked in and had a quick convo while I waited for the food.  I&#39;m a huge fan of tacos and long story short I was not thrilled about this place.  The quality of the meat was great but the mistake they make us using one tortilla, all three tacos fell apart as I grabbed them and in top of that they messed up my order and gave me all chicken tacos"

The atmosphere is completely unremarkable, but they do play nice, low key music. The service is a tad slow, as they have one guy running around like a maniac. But, WOW, is the food amazing. We&#39;ll be back once a month, I&#39;m certain."

They have a dining room as well as take out orders. You can&#39;t go back to the standard runny refried beans of other places after you have theirs. They make them with black beans and they are chunky. My favorite are the tacos but their enchiladas are amazing. They have the best tasting salsa! You can only order their guacamole as a large and small(not on your food) because they make each serving right there. Which is a little inconvenient but it goes to speak for the quality of food.

We dared to try MonteCasino after THOROUGHLY reading all previous Yelp (and other) reviews.,..though we were still worried! 
As others stated, we WERE put at ease and made to feel at home by the limited staff.
MonteCasino IS BYOB without snobbery and if you brought tequila, yet no lime they accommodate, offering shot glasses, ice etc.
The green salsa that comes with the 1 complimentary basket of chips was very impressively complex and spicy hot.
Two of us ordered the Chile Rellenos (w/sides of better-than-routine rice and black refried beans) which were marvelously as good and better then many of the other places we have tried. The third diner loved her enchilada plate and when asked for her choice of filling, the server didn&#39;t bat an eye at the request for one of each (no extra charge nor admonishment regarding substitutions).
When selecting deserts with our very friendly server, the chef overheard me say, &#34;yuck! I hate flan!&#34; He humorously exclaimed by the kitchen window, &#34;My flan is THE BEST!!!&#34; (Did I mention this was a small dining room? )"

Outside it looks like nothing to write home about but the inside ambiance is terrific.  With low lighting and eclectic European music this is a great place to relax and enjoy some really great Mexican food.
          First off the green salsa that comes with their tortilla chips is one of the best we have ever had. We even bought some to take home!! The horchata tastes great and freshly made as well. My vegetarian taco plate was delicious,  with everything perfectly seasoned. My partner&#39;s steak fajita plate was equally delicious, though the steak was scarcely there. The only other minor mishap keeping this place from getting a perfect score is we never seem to get or have enough napkins.  But this is some of the best Mexican food around, no doubt about it!"

My favorites are the homemade guacamole...the large is big, it could be an entree, and the tacos, smaller than traditional tacos, but very flavorful.

The owner is usually our sever, and is polite, unassuming, and friendly without being overbearing. 

This is not a fancy restaurant, so if you can overlook the location and inside decor, this is a five star establishment.

The food is fresh, service is strong, taste is delicious, and prices are low for what you get...and the kickers are that it is BYOB and adjacent to another family-owned business, where the employees are beyond friendly and the variety of beers and ciders are amazing...even by Chicago standards.

Dinner for four costs on average about $45-50.

Just one last note, an excellent example of superb service, seeing that I would need a bottle opener for my beer, without asking, the owner swiftly moved to the counter, got one, and opened it for me. Then he left it on the table for me to use. Wow."

After reading several overwhelmingly positive reviews, we found ourselves at Montecasino. Now, we find ourselves agreeing with all of the great reviews that led us there to begin with.
1. LOTS of flavor in every bite of every dish: from the chips and salsa to the rice and black beans, not to mention the great flavor in the steak fajitas and chicken enchiladas.
2. Good pricing and portion sizes: we left feeling full and satisfied and wanting to go back for more another time.
3. Quaint atmosphere and excellent service: we loved the feeling of being in someone&#39;s kitchen while they cooked for us and served each dish with a smile and friendly comment.

The restaurant is BYOB,  which we did, but there is a wonderful liquor store next door (Ardmore Station Liquors) with amazing service, excellent choices of beer, and knowledgable and friendly owners."

To be fair, some of this slowness is what I love about this restaurant. It&#39;s a family business and each meal is cooked to order. If we ever needed anything, once we caught the attention of the server it was taken care of so well. Case in point, my wife ordered a bottle of water and we were told the tap water had a filter. What a genuine touch that saved us a couple of bucks that they could have pocketed.

The waiting staff was minimal and not attentive to our needs. The food...the food was terrible, and I love tacos! I&#39;ve never met a taco I didn&#39;t like until I came to taco purgatory! This place was the worst Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had the displeasure to consume. Everything tastes and pleated store bought! The chips, the poor grade shredded cheese on my &#34;tacos&#34; the guacamole was so blain I had to mix in hot sauce, salt and pepper; just to even taste it. Honestly the best part of this date was the quality time I spent with my beautiful queen, the bottles Mexican Coke and writing this review as I continue to wait for the waiting staff to approach my table to clear this poor excuse for a meal!

This unassuming little place on the corner of a strip mall like building adjacent to an ugly looking liquor store is a hidden gem. It doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside, and the owners have recently put up some window treatments that make it look even more uninviting, but don&#39;t judge a book by its cover. The reason I gave it a shot in the first place, was due in large part to the great reviews.

I&#39;ve had three experiences here in the last few months. The first was dine in. The place is very clean and the ownership couldn&#39;t be more inviting. Overall service was great, but the real rockstar of this place is in the kitchen. This little place churns out some of the most authentic, flavorful Mexican dishes you&#39;ll ever try. My last two experiences have been carry out, and the quality and consistency has not wavered.

I really hope this place succeeds and stays around for many years to come. If you&#39;re in the area, be sure to stop in or call ahead for pick up. You&#39;ll be glad you did.

Let me get the major complaint out of the way FIRST, and we do realize this may not be specifically with THIS Friday&#39;s alone.

** Friday&#39;s Nachos (regular nachos) have been &#39;discontinued&#39;.  Major bummer.  The Friday&#39;s Nachos have basically been a regular staple of the restaurant since literally the late 80&#39;s.  We asked a manager about this and he had no idea why, but that it had been finalized earlier in the year.  We actually contacted corporate with this question and have yet to receive an answer (I doubt we will).  They now have - instead - some type of &#34;chicken nachos&#34; for about 12.99.  General rule of thumb:  You don&#39;t fix something that isn&#39;t broken after almost three decades.  Also, if for some reason the &#39;regular nachos&#39; were no longer doing well, it&#39;s highly doubtful the chicken nachos will suddenly fair better.

- Our overall service was actually fantastic.  Our waiter (Bryan? African American guy) was being trained and he was beyond attentive, as was his trainer.  A+ on service tonight.

- Food was very good.  Prices have gone up a tad on just about everything, but I guess this is to be expected.

- One final note:  Over the years, the restaurant has obviously been remodeled MULTIPLE times.  We noticed the 2nd floor section (back of restaurant) now seemed to be painted/wall-papered with some very dull, plain, boring beige-ish /green-ish paint or wall-paper.  It&#39;s hard to explain unless you see it.  It was never that way before so this must have been recently done.  Just no vibe to it and it actually takes away from the upbeat atmosphere of that section now, almost brings you down if you keep looking at it - it is just so DRAB.  Again hard to explain, but whoever decided on THIS made a bad decision.

Overall:  Good food, great service this time around.  Removing a classic staple from the menu (again probably not relegated to this Friday&#39;s alone) was a BAD MOVE, and some of the remodeling with this restaurant just is out in left field...  

We will be back, but as stated in my previous reviews we only get here maybe 1-2 times a year on average."

They have the usual: boneless wings, green bean fries, mozzarella sticks, BBQ chicken flatbread, dumplings, and I think that was it. Everything was delicious! Especially the parmesan garlic boneless wings!  

The service started out good, but then later, our server stopped coming by our table to serve us water and for our next choice of appetizers. He forgot our orders a few times as well. Service could have been better. 

The greeter in the front was nice and friendly. He helped my friend charge his phone at the &#34;back office&#34;. He was worried and kept telling my friend that he has no control over his phone because it is in the back and many of the staff goes back there. Nothing was stolen."

It&#39;s never tried to be haute cuisine but the drinks were dependable, burgers and steaks were good and service was customer focused.  I stopped patronizing TGI Fridays as the food and beverage started on a downward spiral.  I found myself starving for a decent lunch last week, popped in for strawberry lemonade and the roast beef dipped.  I had to send back the lemonade that tasted like flavored water.  The waiter was very accommodating and admitted that the mix was off and he was so glad he&#39;d fixed it before they got really busy.  I ordered a coke.  The main event arrived and I&#39;m not sure what kind of roast beef it was, or where it was cut from.  I don&#39;t know what makes lesser cuts of roast beef collect that rainbow glisten (know what I mean?). It was a half notch above Arby&#39;s.  It was pitiful.  The fries were good, so was the Coke and service was pleasant, but I&#39;m done, stick me with the Friday&#39;s fork.  Any kitchen sending out that sorry excuse for roast beef is suspect.  It gets two stars because the service was good!"

So we called ahead for a carry out order. I gave them an hour notice on a 15 minute preparation time order. When I arrived they had not started the order yet. So I ended up waiting a long time. I was not happy but added a tip to the credit card receipt anyway. They never charged the tip to my account so they must not have even looked at it.

On a positive note the food was incredible! And the server was very nice. My wife ordered a regular cheeseburger with bacon and she said it was good. But I ordered a newer item on their menu called the Smoked Stack Burger. It was so good I could hardly believe it. It was cooked to perfection and the Beer-braised sausage &amp; onions, Asiago &amp; cheddar between two fresh hickory-smoked burgers with sweet Memphis seasoning, melted sharp cheddar, Tennessee BBQ sauce, BBQ ranch aioli, applewood-smoked bacon and coleslaw was outstanding!

We are new to this area and we were very excited about being so close to a TGIF. The food is decent; we haven&#39;t had to complain about that. The service is a different story. The first time we came here the service was fine. Since then it&#39;s been downhill. Servers have forgotten to bring multiple parts of our dinner and even almost refused to bring us what we ordered. The worst was when a black waiter was barely serving our table and a table across the aisle from us (another white couple) and giving all his attention and time to a black couple near us (who said that they had never had such good service before). Meanwhile, the couple across the aisle from us didn&#39;t even get their drinks and my husband barely got the sides to his meal. I&#39;m sorry to write this, but we couldn&#39;t believe how we were treated. I think we will be back at TGIF, but probably patronize other locations."

When the server arrived with the Cajun pasta he told me the kitchen was out of soup and asked if I wanted to see the menu to order something else. That&#39;s ridiculous waiting so long to tell me that my order can&#39;t be filled - if I ordered something else my friend would be done by the time my order was ready. 

Also the restaurant wasn&#39;t busy by any means and we were our server&#39;s only table and he was still super slow with refills.

Being that this was the closer of the two, I begrudgingly obliged..   I was pretty shocked to see it so packed; then again, I think there was a game on AND they had $3 Long Islands..

As a pretty staunch ovo-pescetarian, I had a hard time finding seafood or veggie entrees on the menu.  That was pretty surprising to me that chains such as TGI&#39;s haven&#39;t caught up to the shift of the more health-conscious consumer. The only options that I could locate were seafood pasta or a Black Bean Burger, so I had the latter. 

The burger was just OK - kind of flavorless. The burger itself crumbled apart, while the rest of the goop on top (sauce, pickles) slid off.  There was a point when half of my burger was so disassembled that I couldn&#39;t get it back together and resorted to eating it with a knife and fork.   Bleh.

Our server, Brian, was nice and attentive, but seemed overwhelmed with the amount of tables he had to cover.  He did check on us while he was whizzing on by.  (And I hope my +1 gave him a good tip!)  I did have a gross green floater in my water glass, but he took care of it pretty promptly and apologized for it.  He was also good about getting refills to us without us having to ask.

While I understand the &#34;comfort&#34; in chains, I think there are better options in the area."

I&#39;ve been coming here since I was a wee lass and am usually content with this location.
    Service is usually average with the occasional meh server or great server (Daz. [I think that&#39;s the name] is usually really good).
    Food is average, though I very much enjoy the chicken fingers and honey mustard. The seasoning on their fries used to be more which I liked but still, those are decent too. The sizzling chicken and shrimp is another good one, and the French onion is usually my go-to soup if I&#39;m feeling soup. 
    Recent problem I&#39;ve noticed: I don&#39;t know what is up with that girls bathroom (can&#39;t speak for the lads), but it&#39;s got quite the stank going. It kind of smells like a sewer issue, and was at first confined to the bathroom but I was actually starting to notice it by the tables nearby; however, last time I was in it smelled as if they were somehow trying to deal with it.
    It&#39;s of course got the whole bar portion, mixed drinks can sometimes use some help but whatever. They&#39;ve got all kinds of specials on drinks as well as food (including food/appetizer combos at a good price).
    Hours are 11am-2am, so that is nice if you&#39;re looking for something later on. They&#39;ve got their &#34;Stripes&#34; card which has some decent perks if you sign up. Fridays is nothing extraordinary, but it&#39;s consistent and decent."

Here&#39;s what I got:

French Onion (3.15): Good lord this bastard was salty. It looked really damn good (see picture) when I got it but when I uncovered the oozy cheese and crouton, there was this thick (and I mean maple syrup thick)  dark, syrupy substance in it with chunks of onion. It was basically a black gravy There is no way this is the standard recipe for tgi fridays. I probably got a rare f-up where they left a pot of french onion on and it condensed to this thick salty crap. It was WAY too salty, and this is coming from a guy that likes Ramen and olive garden. If you&#39;ve had a similar experience, let me know so I can complain to their HQ. 

I ended up using the soup as gravy for my mashed potatoes haha. It worked well. 

Petite Steak: Cooked surprising well considering my appetizer, I asked for medium, I got a perfect pink medium. It comes with a dollop of this rich garlic butter. If you&#39;re into garlic, this little ball will make your meal. I even dipped my fries in it. I also asked for a side of Jack daniels sauce which I suspect has no Jack Daniels in it. It was very sweet and syrupy. (11.00) (See Picture)

Comes with 2 sides: 

I got the seasoned fries which were crispy and good, and the mashed potatoes which were also pretty darn good.

Service was good, soup came in 15 minutes of sitting, Steak and sides came 15 minutes later. 
 
Now unlike some chain hating snob faces on Yelp, I don&#39;t have some stupid bias against chain restaurants. I take them as they are: salty, consistent, and reasonably priced.  This was was no different with the weird exception of the soup. Would I come here again? Probably, but not unless I really had to. Maybe I&#39;ll try a different location."

The first step to a gud burger is s gud bun &amp; this 1 was definitely not. Totally ruined my whole burger smashin&#39; vibe with its dryness.

I ordered the smothered chicken and spinach and my boyfriend got a jack daniel&#39;s chicken sandwich. My chicken was good but nothing too flavorful or exciting. My boyfriend liked his sandwich but you practically needed a microscope to see the chicken, it was so small! Again, our waiter came by to give us a sales pitch about dessert.

You should probably check out their new Yucatan chicken salad, it was pretty good. Use the lime they give you on it, it makes it. And you probably want to ask for extra avocado because I barely had any on my salad.

Otherwise I typically order the dragon fire chicken, love the jasmine rice that comes with this.

The waitresses are incompetent, one took the plates away and took half of my $8 drink with the dirty dishes. When I asked for a new one since she basically dumped $4 down the drain, she charged me for a whole new one. The second time for whatever reason the bartender was our waiter and we were stuck waiting for drinks and our food for 20 minutes both times. The only thing the managers offer to compensate is a free dessert. No thanks. I wont be back here again."

-took a long time to greet us (5 min maybe)
-was not familiar with the promotion I asked about and instead of asking someone to get info she just made something up. 
-no refills at all. Our cups were empty a majority of the meal
-no plates for appetizer
-never checked in whenever we got food. My boyfriend actually got up to ask her for things 3 times, I stopped 2 other servers, and we even fetched some of our own items from the server station. 
The biggest issue with this is all the tables around us were clearly having issues with her as well. I&#39;ve been a server and the biggest thing is to move and think fast. There was absolutely none of that. She was so pokey, zero emotion and doing weird things like clearing empty tables when you just got double sat. Another couple had to of waited over 15min. just to be greeted. They still had no drinks when we walked out.  Had she been running around I would have understood bc I&#39;ve been there, but that was not at all this girls issue. Just overall not a good experience."

We only came here because my brother, sweet guy that he is, sent me a TGI Friday&#39;s gift card for my birthday. It&#39;s the sort of place he likes to eat, and little ole Goshen, IN doesn&#39;t have a lot of choices, so in this case it really is the thought that counts.

We were seated promptly but in our brief seconds standing in the entrance, there did seem to be a waiting area -- albeit not a big one -- so maybe they remodeled it slightly? In any case, I didn&#39;t make anyone uncomfortable by standing next to a diner&#39;s chair.

They just introduced 20 new menu items and we were given a spiel about this promotion -- order one and get a card for $10 off your next visit. Well, in looking over the entrees, there were some appealing ones, so we both went that route.

Also, their &#34;stripes&#34; frequent diner program offers, it turns out, free chips and salsa on every visit. Random, but hey, why not?

We went for nachos, I got Mediterranean chicken skewers, and the husband got a burger.

The nachos are served &#34;tostada style&#34; which is kind of funny, since this is how nachos were originally made: cheese and jalapeno on each chip. These also have beans on them, and are served with a pile of lettuce, salsa and guacamole. Pretty tasty, you can&#39;t screw these up too badly.

My Mediterranean chicken skewers were a  nice find: two skewers of garlicky-lemony chicken chunks with onions, served over rice, with veggies (squash/zucchini), tzatziki sauce and pita.  The chicken was tender and flavorful, the rice was tasty and the pita was warm and soft. The tzatziki was not quite perfect, but it still tasted good. 

I swear, the wait staff in this place must take happy pills or something, because everyone was exceptionally cheerful. Which is nice, if a little disconcerting. I know, they&#39;re paid to cheerlead their food, so good for them. Our waitress checked back plenty, got us refills promptly and was all around great. 

So even though I would choose Anyway&#39;s (right next door) over Friday&#39;s about 95% of the time, I still have to give this place four stars, for doing what it did well and cheerfully."

I made sure to let the chef know that the food was terrible and I would not be coming back. As I am a cook at a Rock Bottom restaurant i felt I had to voice my opinion to him. The Steak I ordered to be cooked well done was definitely not. I suspect that they don&#39;t even check their meats by temperature as they should and have had complaints in the past seeing as how the waitress who brought my food had to ask me to cut the steak and check it. I choked on the macaroni I ordered as a side because whatever they put on top was overly heated and was visibly burnt. I could have just scraped off the topping and eaten the macaroni but I would have probably chipped a tooth and choked on that as well. It&#39;s one thing that one macaroni side was in that condition but my wife&#39;s was as well. I would go on with what was wrong with the food but I feel that who ever reads this will get the point. Extremely disappointed and will never eat at a TGIF ever again. I suggest you take your money somewhere else. Old country buffet has better service and food than this place.

The young server, who had never checked on us to see how our food was, rolled his eyes at us indignantly when we complained.  Someone, who we think was a manager, came by to apologize and said in a thick accent that he would come back and give us a complimentary something (could not understand him).  Despite the fact that he walked past our table a few times later on, he never stopped to say a word to us.  The server dropped off our check (full price) without a word.

We had 6 adults and a 2yr old. Even though the restaurant was pretty full at 530p on a Saturday, they were able to seat us quickly. So the seating wasn&#39;t the best ever - they squished 2 small tables together by the bathrooms and the beverages. But at least there were less patrons around to get pegged by whatever my nephew felt like throwing (crayons, green bean fries, etc.) And it wasn&#39;t smelly like I expected that corner to be - which tells me they keep this location clean.

And really, the service was great, between my family members&#39; indecisiveness and my rambunctious nephew - our waitress handled us really really well. And the baby loved everyone singing Happy Birthday to Grandpa :)

We also appreciated the benches outside in the shade while we let our stomachs rest before driving again.

Far from the &#34;30 pieces of flair&#34; from Office Space, they seem genuinely cool people, the kind you want to buy a drink for and sit around talking about life.  Every server I&#39;ve had has been conscious of my food allergies, to the point of substituting amaretto for something else in the drink specials.  We usually have our baby with us, and there is no problem getting her a high chair or making room for her car seat carrier.

Hubs and I live in Des Plaines; the Thai restaurant we wanted to try didn&#39;t open until 5:30 on the particular evening we were ordering dinner. So, we stumbled upon Pad Thai Restaurant in Mt. Prospect instead. So glad we did! 

We ordered the crab rangoon, curry (fried) rice, pad Thai w/ veggies and a pork entree. All of the dishes were excellent and the crab rangoons were easily in the Top 3 best I&#39;ve ever eaten. Outstanding! Fresh and plump!

We spent a little over $40 (for 2 people), so more pricey than the Chinese restaurant we like to go to. Portions are very large and the ingredients are very fresh. This is likely a place we&#39;ll only dine on special occasions, not monthly. 

We got carry out, so I don&#39;t know much about what the inside of the restaurant looks like. The woman who took our order was very friendly and the food was ready on time.

One word to say about Pad Thai Restaurant . AMAZING!! Excellent staff, setting, and most important the food! Even is a small place busy and management, Perfect!!! so, take a chance to stop by everyone. Must try their bubble tea, bananas poached in coconut milk and duck is to die for! I&#34;M FAN!!"

Delicious! It did seem a little expensive for how much food I got, though (compared to a place like Penny&#39;s where you really get bang for your buck).

I was not expecting much from a tiny place in a strip mall.  We were the only customers dining in... they seem to do mostly carry out for lunch.  I ordered the Pad See Ewe with tofu... what can I say... I am addicted! 

The service was kind and prompt.  The lunch special is $8 or $9 depending on the meat you choose.  Lunch is served on weekdays until 3 pm.  The lunch special comes with a soup of the day or salad and an appetizer of the day.  The soup of the day sounded boring... some clear broth veggie soup... so I opted for the salad and ordered a small Tom Yum Soup with chicken.  The Tom Yum soup is top notch here!  The salad was pretty good but nothing to write home about.  The appetizer of the day was pot stickers which again were good but nothing too special.

Then, came the main attraction... my Pad See Ewe with tofu... this was amazing... the noodles were cooked perfectly... not too mushy like some Thai places make them.

The one thing I was not happy with was that the restaurant was a bit chill... I hate having to wear my jacket when I eat!  I will still return if I am in the area though!

I live in the city but work in Des Plaines and will eat here any chance I get.  Their chicken panang curry is outstanding and so is their kao soi (coconut curry dish).  Their thai iced tea is a treat. I have not been disappointed with the quality of food and the deliciousness.  I&#39;m so hooked and the owner knows it.

Also, I adore the way it&#39;s decorated. A lot of blues, purples, earth tones, long silky curtains, small tables, interesting traditional thai paintings, and a set of masks that i would really love to steal except for i&#39;m too much of a pussy........

and that&#39;s like..........not respectful. 

Despite the the fact that this place is called pad thai, I have never actually tried to the pad thai. I come here for the thai iced coffee, variety of curries, and entree dishes. 

If you are the type of person that scarfs peanut sauce like it&#39;s going out of style, then i would greatly suggest trying the panang curry. It&#39;s simmered coconut milk with a touch of peanut butter in it. The flavor is absolutely delicious, silky, and has a slight peanut butter richness to it which gives the dish a nice nutty taste. The curry can be accompanied by tofu, veggies, chicken, beef, and shrimp. There are certain up charges on some of the items such as shrimp and beef i believe? but way worth it. 

The garlic noodles are great though it&#39;s not a dish i order very often because i find that the garlic taste can become overpowering towards the end of the meal. Plus, i wouldn&#39;t eat it if i didn&#39;t come prepared with a pack of gum and had to speak to another person (for obvious reasons).

The thai iced coffee is stellar. I wish chain coffee shops carried thai iced coffe because it&#39;s so good and the perfect amount of sweet. Plus it has coconut milk in it which i think is cool. 

The servers are always very kind but beware that there&#39;s usually 1-2 servers per shift so if it get busy you may be waiting a while. Aside from that, this place is great and makes me want to experiment with other restaurants and dishes of the thai persuasion."
pad-thai-restaurant-mount-prospect,Elizabeth W.,lTvtN6Ype23fHMzIc8bb8w,"Des Plaines, IL",0,1,1,279,77,zErK_u6uqASNVaHdXnvLBQ,3.0,2012-06-19,"The food here is pretty solid. The sauce in the pad thai, for example, is clearly made with real tamarind. While they skimp a little on the non-noodle portions of this dish (I could hardly taste any peanut!), the sauce is what makes this one, and it was bright and flavorful. If you order the lard nar, the noodles in it are made fresh in-house, not frozen and reheated. I know because on my visit, I saw them making them! The menu is also pretty comprehensive, containing chinese-influenced dishes like drunken noodles as well as vietnamese-influenced dishes in addition the traditional thai standards. The waitstaff is also knowledgeable about the menu and can answer questions about what sauces contain fish products, what can be made without peanuts, etc.

Why not 5 stars, then? This place is seriously weird.

For starters, they aren&#39;t open on the weekends. I don&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t open for lunch on the weekends--I mean they are completely closed on Saturday and Sunday. 

They have takeout lunch specials, which is nice, but they are different from the regular lunch specials and the dinner specials (which are not specified on the sign as being valid for takeout, but since they are printed in the takeout menu, I assume they are). Combined with the coupon specials you can get on the web site (some of which are dine-in only, while others are ok for carry-out and delivery), there are a ton of different specials to remember. This can make ordering over the phone really confusing. They would do well to have one set of specials for lunch and one for dinner, or just one set of specials overall.

I am also confused about the availability of menu items. I wanted the mango and sweet rice dessert, but they said they didn&#39;t have mango at this time of year (and the menu did not indicate that you couldn&#39;t get this item). Yet, they were making a jackfruit smoothie for somebody while I was there. If I am not wrong, in Florida both jackfruit and mango have the same growing season. I would also guess the demand for mango is higher than for jackfruit. Strange.

Finally, they don&#39;t list their delivery area anywhere, and when I called to place an order, the person on the phone said they do not deliver to my area. He said the delivery area is for the town of Mount Prospect...but the restaurant is literally across the street from Des Plaines. If you walk out the door and cross the road, you are in Des Plaines. Most of Mount Prospect is farther away from this restaurant than where I live, but for some reason, they will not deliver here. It makes me wonder if they really would deliver to the part of Mount Prospect that is over by unincorporated Prospect Heights. This is a shining example of why I think restaurants should always list their delivery areas on takeout materials/web sites.

Anyhow, parking here is easy, they don&#39;t have booze, and service is speedy. I can see them picking up an extra star from me very easily if future visits/attempts to get delivery go better...or if their mussaman curry is as tasty as it looks."

What a disappintment.  We had not been to Pad Thai in quite some time and were terribly disappointed at lunch today.  I had the Panang noodles with chicken and the noodles were dry and too tough to cut thru with my fork and the sauce was bland and lacked any flavor, even after adding their chili paste.  My husband had Cashew pork and also commented on how terribly bland his lunch was.  Not only was there no heat in a dish marked with a chili pepper, there was not the usual wonderful layers of flavor which is the best part of Thai cooking.  Even the half cup of soup had no flavor and the Thai ice tea was watered.  Won&#39;t bother going back with all the other Thai restaurants in the NW burbs."

NEVERTHELESS...

Everything I have had at this place has been awesome! I recommend getting the dinner combo... it is only a few bucks more than the entree alone and it comes with salad, soup, and little appetizer (egg rolls, crab rangoon, or pot stickers). What a good deal, right!? The Five Star Chicken will BLOW YOUR MIND! The perfect level of spice combined with high quality, fresh ingredients really makes the flavors explode in your mouth. Not spicy enough for you? Don&#39;t fret, because the hot chili sauce they provide at the table not only adds heat, but also adds a delicious flavor that many hot sauces do not possess. I liked the sauce that covered my five star chicken so much that when I was done, I covered my leftover white rice with the sauce and brought that home... seriously, the sauce itself can make anything fabulous!
Top your meal off with a fresh bubble tea and you&#39;re set!

If you&#39;re in the area, definitely hit this place up... I will be happy to take the leftovers off of your hands!"

Total price for the Chicken (NOT shrimp) Pad Thai was $9.12.  For that price, i was expecting a little more ingredients.  It was so BASIC - shredded carrots and red cabbage, beans sprouts, green onions and nuts. No Tofu like the traditional recipe. 

He offered for plastic porks and napkins to go but i just left in a hurry!!! Totally disappointed and angry!!! I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!

The Pad Thai&#39;s better than the Pad Thai at Little Bangkok (another nearby Thai place). Panang Curry&#39;s amazing. If you haven&#39;t had Panang Curry before.

Also recommending the Pad Woon Sen. It&#39;s made with glass noodles. If you haven&#39;t had glass noodles, try them: they&#39;ll make you have a mouthgasm.

If you like curry, try their panang rice/noodle dish. Their lunch special is a great deal. Sometimes is vegetarian appetizer and if it&#39;s not for that day, just let them know and they&#39;ll get one for you. 

Dinner time is my favorite time to go though. Its less crowded and much better service. I never feel like I&#39;m being rushed or pushed out. The service overall is amazing!! And always check their website for coupons! I just can&#39;t get enough of this place. My fave in the area!"

The slices of beef that they had in the pad see ew was really tough and I didn&#39;t like it much at all. What sucked even more was the panang curry. I&#39;m REALLY upset about it. It looked like they put frozen peas and corn in this watery curry sauce with the same beef that they had for the pad see ew. The curry sauce was really watery.  It was more like curry soup if anything. I didn&#39;t know peas and corn were part of the meal and the meat was the same meat from the other dish.

When my office moved near here last fall, I went on a mission to find the best thai food, where I could get in and out in an hour-ish.

Pad Thai tops my lunch thai food restaurants and is in heavy rotation for my coworkers and me, however, is #3 in my overall Thai Restaurants in/around Arlington Heights list.

Lunch is great here and you get a soup or salad, appetizer and main dish.     Most soups I&#39;ve had here have been great, with the exception of the coconut milk soup.    It looked great, I&#39;m just not a fan.
I&#39;ve liked the salads and appetizers too -- especially the mystery ones.   I had some fried tofu here the other day that was great, nice light sauce on the side.    They&#39;ve also got mystery tempura veggies as an appetizer.    It&#39;s kind of fun to guess what lies beneath the lightly fried breading.    Sweet Potato?   Who knew?

But I digress.     I judge every thai place by their Pad Kee Mao -- and Pad Thai&#39;s is good.    Yummy wide rice noodles?  Check.   Basil?  Check!  Egg? Check.   Eggplant?  Check.   Green Beans?  Check.    Tomato?  Check.    Onion?  Check.    All good, made spicy and with tofu -- even better.    This ranks right up there.
I also really like their Pad See Ewe - basically, the wide rice noodles with egg and broccoli in a light brown sauce.    Again, very good.

My coworkers have tried various fried rice dishes, cashew chicken, pad thai, etc., and all were said to be good.

Service can be a bit slow, but that&#39;s a minor complaint.
Give it a shot if you&#39;re near 83 and Oakton in Mt. Prospect."

I finally had the chance to come and try the pad Thai and it was delicious!! I ordered carry-out and they cooked the pad Thai less than 10 minutes. It was under 10 bucks and it was worth it because they gave me a pretty good portion of food. Pad Thai was really good and tasted authentic. The place looked nice too! It&#39;s pretty but casual. I&#39;m definitely coming here often :)

Been looking forward for this place to open for awhile since we shop close by a lot... And today we finally saw the &#34;open&#34; sign lit and decided to give it a try.

We ordered a kal goosoo + jaeyook bokkeum and a jjambeong for my girlfriend and I.  As we sat around and waited, first impression is that the establishment is very clean with very simple but modern decor that is very pleasing to the senses.

Presentation: A! Our food came out quickly in these really satisfying large porcelain bowls and the servings are... HUGE!  Which was definitely a surprise from the very reasonable prices.  The presentation doesn&#39;t look the most traditional for Korean cuisine, so we guess that&#39;s where the &#34;fusion&#34; came in, since the food is nothing but traditional!

Taste: A+! The food we had was simply amazing.  Sometimes at places kal goosoo can be too bland and jjambeong can be too salty, but both bowls were seasoned perfectly.  We could taste every single ingredient in the soup, and the flavors were just so clean and comforting!

Service: A+! Really helpful, young, and polite staff. Enough said.

Ok now, we are finally done with our meal. So full and satisfied, will definitely return on a regular basis. Look forward to see this to grow into a good business!

p.s. We are not affiliated with the restaurant what so ever... The amazing experience honestly prompted this praise filled review! Good job, guys!"

Got fried dumplings thinking they&#39;d be the big homemade ones... nope! They were the packaged ones from h mart. Where you can get a huge bag for like $7. I paid $5 for 6 pieces. Just because you put it nicely on a plate, doesn&#39;t make it worth it. Rip off.

The lajomyun was nasty too. No seafood except baby shrimps and cheap ass squid. No flavor. Just bad.

We only got 2 things since I had a feeling the food would suck, but I still felt ripped off. On top of that the waitress had no idea what she was doing and got flustered after 2 other tables came in. She literally gave me the check for the table of 4 on the other side of the room and I almost paid for it. They weren&#39;t even done eating!!  I&#39;m sure it was just a mistake but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 

I was looking forward to this place opening but no thanks.

Never again. Seriously take your money elsewhere."

I was so looking forward to its opening a little while back. And I really wanted to like this place since it&#39;s next to H-Mart where I do my weekly grocery shopping. 

The restaurant is clean and has a nice setup. Service was kinda slow. I wish they could serve the side dishes first while waiting for the main dish. The waiter did his job bringing out the food but nothing more. And what&#39;s about carrying the dishes to the table by a utility cart?

About the food, first off, the side dishes were not that impressive. 3 (kimchi, pickled daikon, fish cake) instead of 5 or 6 you usually get in a Korean restaurant. They tasted like what you get from next door - more of grocery store quality. Same thing happened to the spicy seafood noodle I ordered. One piece of shrimp, two pieces of mussels, and a few squid rings, that&#39;s all the seafood it had and they all tasted like the frozen ones you could buy from next door. Soup and noodle were just okay. 

With all the other much better Korean restaurants in the area, I may not go back even with its great location."

Ambiance - the place is very modern and very clean.  

Menu - very limited, basically 3 noodle dishes and 2 rice dishes ish. There are actually a few variations on each so it looks like there is more.

Fusion? Not sure why but it says Korean fusion outside but I did not see any fusion at all. Think more cafe Korean.

Bulgogi - a pile of meat, some of it was so overcooked it was burnt into my cast iron hot plate. The taste was decent.

Hot sauce - I think it&#39;s hot sauce, not the bilmi, the little one that came in a dish that is soy saucey based. It was so good. Like I could drink it good.

Kal goo soo - tasted like chicken noodle soup with beef. Noodles were slightly firm but lacked flavor. 

Fish cake - the free fish cakes were excellente! Firm and sweet. Literally sweet.

Potatoes - ok just ok, good smooth consistency, not powdery

Kim Chi - It ok, about average."

It&#39;s a small place with a few tables and chairs. The menu is pretty limited. 

I had the : Bulgogi (15.00) I have to say this is possibly the best version of this dish I&#39;ve had in the few Korean restaurants in this area. The plate of meat is substantial and not filled with tiny pieces of leftover trimmings that I have seen before in other places. 

For the 15 dollars you also get rice and soup and 3 side dishes which were all decent. 

The only issues I had with this place were pretty minor: 
The service is a little off. I didn&#39;t get any utensils to eat my side dishes with but they quickly apologized when I pointed it out. Also they only have soda in cans that are 1.50 each which is kind of annoying.

I would say the atmosphere is definitely comfortable and casual. One weird thing I noticed is the sign on the front that says &#34;Korean Fusion.&#34; From the menu it looks like pretty standard Korean fare so I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s fused with. 

Overall a decent place for a quick lunch stop. 3-3.5 stars."

It&#39;s called noodle lounge but had mostly rice dishes (as explained by our server) and those too were soups which is fine but we didnt really know we were ordering soup. Again, this might just be me but it was a bit confusing and very limited menu. Otherwise good location next to a favorite place of mine...tous le jours...plenty of parking and the food we did order was hot and fresh. I had the seafoos soup and my husband had the ground beef I believe. One order was more than enough for two people! We made the mistake of ordering 2. Literally left most of it there when we were done cause there&#39;s really no way to pack it. Our server left us a plastic container....when you see the size of the bowl and the boiling temp of the soup...there;s really no way for you to pour it into the small mouth container...so we just left it all there.

But the food is not the biggest problem. This restaurant is apparently ran by someone with little experience. The staffs are nice and polite, but they just make too many mistakes. If they cannot manage customer experience, they are not going to last very long.
They don&#39;t keep the orders of the parties waiting. I heard guests complaining about they mistakenly seating parties that came late first. 
We ordered our noodles. After 30 minutes waiting, the food did not come. When we checked with our waitress, she suddenly realized she did not put the order through. It didn&#39;t occurr to her that we are sitting there waiting if we hadn&#39;t check with her. They offered to have one of the noodle bowl on the house; that was a nice gesture.
When the check came, there was another surprise. The noodle was charged $2 more each. I asked why and the waitress said because it is the weekend and they only offer the dinner menu for lunch. Well, I know some restaurant does this and it is ok. But when I ordered I was pointing to the item on the lunch menu, the waitress did not say anything and took my order. In the end they just bumped up the price claiming it is dinner size. I dont mind paying the extra $2 but I would certainly wish to be informed first!

For a Saturday night we didn&#39;t have to wait which I think was unusual for this restaurant. It was very loud. I couldn&#39;t hear the people at the other end of the table. I wasn&#39;t too bothered by it though. 
The service was alright. We didn&#39;t have to wait too long for anything. 
I ordered the ahi tuna spinach salad. I have no complaints about the flavor but man was it expensive. 17 for a salad seems pretty pricy. I&#39;ve had much more filling salads for less than half the price.

The food took a really long time from the time we ordered to the time it was delivered to our table. That was the only drawback, but luckily we were in no hurry. I got the grilled fish tacos which I recommend (especially for lunch!). My boyfriend did the sliders which came with fries. The fries are super thin and crispy and totally addicting!

We have Landry&#39;s card and thought we try it out. As soon as went inside the service was just absolutely amazing. The ambiance is very cozy and Casual. Our served was Brandon and he was really informative about the menu and gave us outstanding service. We ordered the chicken tortilla soup and three cheese potato cakes and it was delicious. The potato cakes are a must have. For dinner we ordered traditional calzone it was just the right oven time and perfect amount of cheese. My husband had the bow tie pasta and he liked the flavor and the sauce. Overall, highly recommended this restaurant.

A friend treated my husband and I to birthday dinner here and I was pleasantly surprised.

I ordered the pot pie, which was delicious (and is enough to bring me back just for that) and my husband had the widow maker. Our friends ordered appetizers, soup and salad for their meal.

And they brought us red velvet dessert for our birthday complete with candles! :)

We&#39;ll be back."

We were presented at the funeral home with tons of suggestions... Many were buffet style, you know the usual soggy chicken and mixed veggies... Or Italian style... Mostacolli for days... With a minimum number of guests at 25.... Well... I remembered Claim Jumpers in Hoffman Estates on rt 59... With easy access to I-90 expressway... and remembered enjoying their food.  I&#39;d been to previous funeral luncheons, at other locales  where one could  order off the menu.  I searched online and found they had several limited menus to choose from.  We chose the &#34;Copper Miners&#34; menu, some choices for everyone!  It was $14.99 per guest and that included a non alcoholic beverage.  (Most buffets added that at $2.00 additional per guest) When I phoned, just two days before, Marlene was kind and offered her condolences, she said they would take care of it all. (Literally I was only on the phone with her for 4-5 minutes!  She did not take a deposit as all of the other spots wanted at least $100 dollars down. The day of the funeral arrived and  I phoned an hour before arriving at Claim Jumpers to let them know a rough number of guests to expect.  When we arrived they had it all set up.  We had 15 more guests than confirmed just an hour before...and they had no problem accommodating us! Service was wonderful.  Menus were placed at each seat and there were two more choices that were not on the online menu... Beef tri tips and the 14&#34;BBQ chicken pizza!  The food was amazing!  Pot pie, fish tacos, burgers, pasta, chicken salad and BBQ chicken salad to name a few of the popular choices...Our guests LOVED it!  My father in law was a foodie and he would have loved it too! 
We chose the tip amount to leave. As there was no obligatory % automatically added. Everyone left filled with yummy food, arms of take home boxes and fond memories of our time together celebrating my father in laws life!  Thank you for a wonderful experiences and for making it so easy for us!  If you have a group... Over 12 guests..(think Church group, book club, bowling group, birthday celebration). Ask for the copper miners menu!  Call ahead and Marlene or one of her friendly staff will assist you!  
Two thumbs up ... All around 
(We had 41 guests)"

She mentioned they have brunch buffet that includes ribs and tilapia...I was sold already!

Me, her and my two cousins ventured over as it isn&#39;t too far from them. The place is huge and is obviously good for families and large groups. We got a nice booth near the action (buffet) so we didn&#39;t have a long journey to the eats. Staff was quite nice in accomodating us in terms of seating and make sure we had a good dining experience.

The buffet was nice as they had eggs, bacon, sausage, tilapia, eggs benedict, broccoli casserole, roasted potatoes, french toast, turkey slices, strawberry stuffed french toast, salad and multiple pastries. They had an omelet station as well as baby back pork ribs located behind the omelet station. I&#39;m sure they kept them behind the station so people wouldn&#39;t hijack all the ribs. They had mimosas as well but for some reason they brought them out with ice...never had mimosas with ice and never will again. I told them going forward no ice! 

Good place to check out for brunch as my review states and I&#39;ve heard the lunch and dinner is pretty good as well."

For one thing, the menu is extensive, somewhat intimidating, and indicative of the fact that plenty of these dishes are frozen or ready-made to be dropped in a deep-frier or microwave. A restaurant with a clear focus on what they aim to be doesn&#39;t have fish tacos, burgers, steak, roasted chicken, pasta, crab, lobster, and so forth, all under one umbrella. 

That being said, there are a few winning dishes present, enough to come back once in a while. The one item that stands out above the rest is the southwest egg rolls (I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re called). AMAZING! They&#39;re like the love child of flautas and wonton fried egg rolls. 

Their cake is okay cold, like they serve it but we took a slice to go and accidentally found out that at room temp it is far superior and uber-gooey!

The service could be a ton better. It&#39;s inefficient, lagging at times, and leaves you wondering how they&#39;re trained. Everyone is pleasant but refills are not kept up with and forget about having your table bussed! Every. Time. I have to stack my own plates and leave them on the edge, begging for them to be picked up. But again, some of their food is good enough to not mind coming back."

It also had no cheese inside it.  (This is the 2nd time we&#39;ve had to do this at a Claim Jumper restaurant).  Be careful what you order.  The Ahi Tuna Salad was good.  
Customer Service - Very Good! Waitress was friendly, personable, and prompt.  They handled the issue with our food in a great manner.  Allowing us to order something else and taking care of dessert. 
Ambience - I like the Lodge feel of Claim Jumpers decor. It was a bit noisy but not loud.  
Bathrooms - Could be cleaner. 

I find that restaurants that have a several page menu don&#39;t do all the items they serve well and unfortunately you run the risk of ordering something bad, frozen/microwaved etc.   This has happened twice now at Claim Jumper and we won&#39;t return."

First it took the waiter 45 minutes to fulfill our drink order.  Then we ordered two appetizer samplers and one of the samplers arrived at the far end of the table in about 20 minutes, and the other end of the table did not receive our appetizer sampler for 40 minutes.  The goofy waiter just laughed and said &#34;kitchen running slow&#34; when we asked him about our order.   

Next the waiter must have decided to take an hour break and reappeared after 60 minutes for what I thought would be our entree order.  Instead he wanted to refill drinks.  Again, another 45 minutes to refill the drinks then went by. 

Finally...after sitting at this &#34;restaurant&#34; for over 2 hours our waiter decided to take our entree order.   Mercifully it only took only 40 minutes to get out our soups and salad.   I have to laugh at my &#34;potato soup&#34;.  It was more of a potato &#34;paste&#34;. I joked with my co worker that when I tipped the bowl, no actual &#34;soup&#34; spilled out.   The &#34;paste&#34; stayed in the bowl!

When the entrees finally arrived, my ribs and shrimp appeared before me as small, withered shrimp with ribs that looked and tasted like 4 day old shoe leather.   These ribs literally tasted like dried out jerky that had been fermenting for weeks.   The only acceptable portion of the meal was the vegetable and loaded baked potato.  

Between the horrible food and the 3 hour long process I was exhausted and praying for mercy!  Claim jumper? Never again!"

Today we went to the one in Hoffman estates. We were taking my mother in law out for a nice dinner and figured this one was closer to her house.  All week we had bragged about how great this restaurant was. I do have to say that the food was good. Not as wonderful as the lombard location,  but good non the less. I always get the southwest egg rolls as a meal. I do NOT like overly spicy food and these were super spicy. I ate a few of them but when I mentioned it to the server, she was less than empathetic to my complaint.  

My biggest complaint about this place was the service. We sat down and our server didn&#39;t greet us at all. She just asked what we wanted to drink. After being there for just a few minutes, she wanted to take our order. We hadn&#39;t even decided on appetizers yet. Another thing that bothered me, was that we were literally  10 minutes into our meal and she was already asking if we needed boxes. I felt like we were being rushed from the moment we got in.  I had been a waitress for the majority of my working life and I felt she skipped all the little things that make going out to eat a pleasure.  If someone orders a steak, you bring A1... if they get fries, you bring ketchup. At no point did she come by to see how things were going. We were flagging her down whenever we needed something.

All and all, I was really let down with claim jumpers this time. I doubt I will be going back to this location again, but really hope my review gets to the manager so they can correct this problem. Nothing is worse than going out to dinner and feeling like your being &#34;annoying &#34; to your server."

I have heard good and bad about this place.  I finally decided to check it out. The restaurant is beautiful and the service was good.  We sat in the bar area to get some happy hour appetizers.  Breadsticks - good. Potatoes skins with pork - burnt on the bottom and dry. Chicken wings - dry.  We split the meatloaf. Way too salty, looked pre-packaged, too much seasoning and not hot.  Made my stomach upset. If you want a nice dinner, go to Coppers Hawk on the other side of 59&amp;72."

Our waitress was friendly told us that things where made from scratch. I watched our food be placed on the tray to bring out, and the guy that had to bring it out was chatting with a waiter letting the food get cold. I had the seafood platter didn&#39;t care for the flavor of the rice and the fish why because the fish was no good, and covered it up by blacking it The fry&#39;s where loaded down with salt wow, Killing me here, But the steak chili was off the chain thick and great kick .Again our sever was great and a good job she did.
But pushing old fish off on me was a turn off and I won&#39;t ever order fish or seafood from a chain restaurant again.

Ask at Restaurants
Whenever you&#39;re purcha ing seafood, in a restaurant, ask if the seafood has been treated with sodium tripolyphosphate, or STPP. If they don&#39;t know, don&#39;t buy."

We have been been to Claim Jumpers many times, but the quality of food has gone way down hill.  Not even close to resembling our previous experiences. I write this after just leaving this place.  We had dinner reservations for 6:00 on a Saturday evening.

We had a party of four to celebrate my birthday.  Two of us ordered the pasta...both selections were average.  My son had the strip steak...it was very fatty.  My husband ordered the chicken and rib combo.  That was by far the worst meal of the group.  The ribs were dry and obviously sitting around a while.  The chicken was completely inedible...absolute mush.   It was honestly the consistency of play dough.   For rotisserie chicken, Sams Club and Costco completely blow them out of the water.


We never make an issue of the food we receive, but this needed to be addressed.  We informed the waitress who then got her very inexperienced manager.  He came over and said he was sorry, but it never sounded sincere.  He took $7.00 off a $25 meal.  I&#39;m not sure what I was expecting, but certainly not that for a meal that was hardly touched and they were informed of the problem.

The table next to us ordered the chicken parmesan pasta and we could see that had been sitting for a long time too as it was very dry and over cooked.

So $160 later, we felt like we completely wasted our money.  We did let the waitress know that her manager was clueless, but that doesn&#39;t go far in taking back a truly bad dinner that we paid a lot for.  I wish there was more recourse to make up for the experience.  Guess letting everyone else know will be our only choice."

The decor is enjoyable and the atmosphere is calm.The service however, is as close to horrible as it gets.Hostess and manager were very pleasant and I was seated immediately. My waiter however was visibly unpleasant and assumed that because we ordered drinks and an appetizer from the happy hour menu that we wouldn&#39;t want dinner, hence his initial attitude. Throughout the whole meal we waited extended periods of times for him to return for anything we needed, and when he did return he was in a rush to leave again to the point where we had to be yelling our requests at him as he hurried away. We constantly had other waitresses stepping because we were visibly left hanging. The drinks were lacking in taste. I had food falling off of my plate because apparently I got an extra small plate for my rib and half rotisserie chicken combo. Food was very average in taste.Overall I want impressed with any part of the experience."

She literally pulled a shard of glass out of her mouth after biting into the warm cookie- thank goodness it did not cut her, or she didn&#39;t swallow it! 

We alerted the server who let the manager know, and frankly we were surprised that all they did was take the cookie off the bill. I have friends in the restaurant business that were totally appalled, and said the entire meal should have been comped and they should have gone above and beyond- glass in food is clearly a big uh-oh! 

The food was fine, but unfortunately I left my leftovers there because I was so turned off and my grandma ended up tossing hers the next day because she felt uneasy about eating the rest.

Aside from that, the food was fine (not bad but nothing super special) and the server was very friendly.

We certainly won&#39;t be going back, not only because of the glass in the food, but because the manager just didn&#39;t seemed too concerned or bothered, which was off putting!"

It was a pathetic plate with two tacos and about three tablespoons of rice and a total of about 1.0 ounces of fish for the price of 11.99!!  I pulled the fish out of the tacos (one tiny sliver per taco) and put them on my bread plate.  I showed it to the bartender and said I am not ok w this. I cannot pay 11.99 for nothing. She agreed that it was a small portion and took them off the bill.   No manager came to explain this debacle or make it better.    We will not be returning.  Ugh.

I thought the food was okay. 

What really ticked me off was the crabby girl behind the counter. Either learn to be more welcoming when greeting and seating people or find a different job. When we were leaving my father asked if there were anymore root beer candies as the bowl was empty. We seriously could not believe how she stormed over, grabbed the bowl and refilled the bowl.

They have this GINORMOUS chocolate cake, with a slice the size of your head. I didn&#39;t have room to brave it, but it reminded me of that huge chocolate cake in Matilda.

My date wasn&#39;t satisfied with his meal, I think it was a country fried steak. He said it was very leathery. But the staff was friendly and attentive, and he soon had a different dish.

 We went in on a Tuesday night to try it out we were seated in dining room and after asking our server to move further away from the door because we were cold the server stated &#34; good luck!, it&#39;s cold in the whole restaurant because the Heat was not working&#34;. Now let me say it was -5 below out a warning when came in could of least been more acceptable.

The server didn&#39;t even bring out the bread till we had to ask for it , which it came out half way through our entrees course. 
We spent over 75$ for horrible service and food we never felt welcomed or satisfied. A manager seemed to walk by a few times but never stopped at the table  was too busy talking to other employees.

From the quasi-rustic lodge decor to the comfort food dominated menu with portions of epic size (have you SEEN their chocolate cake?!).  It&#39;s most definitely a study in over-indulgence, and sometimes, that&#39;s not a bad thing.

This is the type of place that you would want to go to if you hadn&#39;t eaten in days or if you really have a thing for leftover restaurant food.  I can&#39;t stress enough how huge the portions are.  As for the food, I&#39;d say it&#39;s average to above average, depending on what you order.  I am personally a fan of their chicken pot pie, but I have tried several other things on the menu and have not been as impressed.  Their desserts are practically a meal in themselves, so heed my warning and do not attempt without a buddy (or 3).

As for the service, I&#39;d say it&#39;s typical sit-down service.  The wait staff is friendly enough where you don&#39;t think that they&#39;re spitting in your food in the kitchen.  Our drinks were refilled quickly enough for us not to wonder where the waitress had gone, and our food was served piping hot and in a timely manner.

If you&#39;re looking for a casual-ish typical American dining establishment and you have a hankering for comfort-type foods, Claim Jumper will not let you down.  If you&#39;re watching your waistline, I&#39;d recommend steering clear of this land of lavishness."

The alfredo sauce was buttery, chicken cooked well, and pasta cooked well.  Of course, for dinner I shared a piece of their SIX-LAYERED chocolate cake!  In my opinion the slice was so rich in chocolate that each layer could feed one person.

This was my first dining experience at Claim Jumper. I&#39;ve never even heard of it before until my boss suggested it. Since our hotel (Marriot) was situated in the middle of nowhere, we really didn&#39;t have much choice but this happened to be a really good option! We loved it! Despite the negative reviews, I hold this restaurant higher than most average chain restaurants based on my first visit.

This place is like Cheesecake Factory meets Long Horn - it operates on a similar formula of outrageously huge and diverse menu, ridiculously large portion size meal with decent to excellent flavor, reasonable prices, and cheesy and themey decor. Yes it&#39;s a typical American excessiveness but as long as food tastes good I totally embrace it!! Almost everything I had  was satisfactory to impressive!! 

I&#39;ve tried the following:
1)avocado rolls - 3.5 stars 
2)Seared Blackened Ahi - 4 stars. Very good!
3)Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut- 4 stars. Love the spicy and sweet coconut sauce!
4)Strawberry Fields Salad with grilled chicken - 4 stars -  Nice combo of sweet and salty flavors!
5)California Chicken Quesadilla - 3.5 stars
6)Jumper mud pie - 4.5 stars!!! Perfect treat for ice cream lovers! Sooooo good and sooo massive!!! Screw diet!
7)Lemon bar brulee - 4 stars. It&#39;s good, but I&#39;m not that into lemon flavor cakes.

Well, unfortunately I was disappointed. Now, we did order carry out so I can&#39;t comment on the atmosphere. However, the food was bland and the portions were small for what we paid. We ordered the chicken Cesar salad with blackened chicken (which wasn&#39;t blackened...really disappointing....you&#39;d be better off getting a Cesar salad at IHOP) for $12 and the Widowmaker burger for $13. Fries were good. Burger was on par with Red Robin, but the burger patty was underwhelming for what you pay. We also got the Southwestern egg rolls...meh, very dry and they looked like they&#39;d been sitting out for a while...portion size was good for the $10 you pay. Service was ok, but a lot of confusion. When I called to place the order I asked if I could get the total. The person on the phone said yes, but that it would take a couple minutes, so I just decided to just find out when I picked up. Overall, won&#39;t return to this place.

Service from staff and manger was sub par had to ask repeatedly for to go box and bill. Staff was heard on several times discussing getting drunk and were chitchatting as guests and food was waiting. Manager was apologetic but didn&#39;t offer enough nor fast enough to repair meal experience."

It was so warm inside the restaurant that all tables in our section were fanning themselves. It was so warm it was difficult just waiting for our food to come. Several tables complained but management did not care. In fact did not even come over to say why it was so hot. Employees should not have to work in those conditions. The food was mediocre at best. Upon leaving I addressed with front staff and said I was unhappy - they did not care. I said I would blog about it the response was &#34;go ahead &#34;. Our bill was over $100.00! Very bad experience! Do not go on hot days - Not sure if the heat works in the winter! Patrons beware of rude staff who do not care about your comfort or dining experience. Not worth the money!

We arrived on a busy Saturday night- but this location was huge- so there was no wait at all for a table. The furniture at this location reminds me a bit of the size of the restaurant- huge and a bit overbearing- but comfortable. I had a pineapple margarita to start- it was okay- but nothing special. For dinner I simply ordered the California Club sandwich. The sandwich was incredibly large- uneatable for me as I couldn&#39;t even put it into my mouth. I had to remove bread in order to make it a manageable sandwich. And it was just okay- I&#39;ve had club sandwiches at restaurants that were absolutely delicious- something about this one just didn&#39;t really seem great to me. My husband enjoyed his entree though- hence the 3 stars. Our server was fine too- she was attentive, refilled drinks when we wanted, and was very pleasant. The other reason for my 3 stars is that the bathroom floors were really sticky- :(. Other than that- I&#39;d come here again, nothing terrible, but also nothing really exciting to come back for in the future. However, I did see the chocolate cake on my way out- and that does seem impressive!"

Chase was INCREDIBLE. We felt welcomed by him before we even sat down. He made recommendations throughout the meal that were pretty accurate. 

The food was underwhelming, to say the least. We all tried something different. Our calamari appetizer took about 20-25 minutes. Our food hit the table shortly after. I ordered the meatloaf. It was super salty. The mashed potatoes looked like they had just taken an ice cream scooper mold and slopped it on the plate. The highlight of the food for all of us was the veggies that our dishes came with."

A bit dark and rustic and the service was just ok. Had to switch from a floor table to a booth because the chairs were way too low for the table!

This weekend I found a new favorite dish, the Pork Loin. They give you a generous portion of sliced pork loin over the mashed potatoes, along with some healthy and yummy squash/zucchini. In addition, they give you this big ass biscuit; I loved that buttermilk biscuit. Needless to say my meal was a 5, the service was a 5 since my soft drink was actually refilled and the waiter actually was engaging and had a good repore with our table. 

The next visit I might just try the Jambalaya or the meatloaf sandwich that my fellow diners had. Oh, and they do take reservations, so avoid the wait."

We literally licked our plates clean.

They didn&#39;t have the spring rolls which was the first disappointment. Ordered the papaya salad with medium spice, which had tiny dehydrated shrimp in it ( gross ) and was super spicy. I&#39;ve never had papaya salad with shrimp in it and I definitely know my Thai spice scale so that salad was way TOO spicy.

We ordered the Rama noodle delight and panang curry. The panang curry was good but honestly they are so stingy on the rice that came with it so had to order another rice since it was not enough ( they charged us extra for it too )

The Rama noodles were a hot mess. Some of the noodles were soggy and some were all bunched up together as a big crispy lump. I asked the waitress if the noodles were suppose to be that consistency and without hesitation or concern she said yes. I asked again since I felt like it wasn&#39;t and she repeatedly just kept saying &#34; yea yea.&#34;

Overall this place is overrated with mediocre food and subpar service."

I saw several Yelp buddies speak relatively highly of V-Thai, so I strong-armed him into dinner here!

The space is cute and clean with about 8 tables. There was one other occupied table at 7:30 on a Saturday, and many people came in for Take-Out orders.

He had the Pad Thai ($10) and I had the Panang (Curry) Noodle Delight ($11), AKA the infamous N11. 


Verdict: 

Pad Thai: He says 3, but I think 3.5
The noodles were very short (odd) and it was kind of dry/way light on the sauce, but I sampled it and thought the flavors were good.  Ingredients were fresh and portion size was fair. It came out lukewarm, which is what was more disappointing for him.


Chicken Panang Noodles Delight: 4
I&#39;d never had noodles like this: thick and fried (so some stuck together). I liked the fried texture, but it was admittedly a bit difficult to eat with the other foods in the dish given the juxtaposition. I&#39;d eat some noodle, then chicken/veggies. The sauce softened some of the noodles; I liked the chewy texture on those. 
(Note: The noodles didn&#39;t hold up well as leftovers; they all but disintegrated into small mushy pieces upon reheating.)

The curry was flavorful and luckily on the thicker side (as compared to that other Thai place), the veggies were crisp and fresh, and the chicken was tender and abundant. It didn&#39;t have much heat/spice, but I&#39;d rather have too little than too much!


Service was friendly and unobtrusive. Our waters were refilled, and we were given little candies with our check. She also asked if we&#39;d like our check split,  which was a nice offer.

I&#39;d definitely come again - I have my eye on the Basil Duck dish for next time!"

The food is consistently fresh, beautifully presented, and incredibly flavorful. 

My favorite plates are the chicken rama delight and the cucumber salad. My boyfriend loves the massaman curry and the spring rolls. We have been coming here regularly for the past couple of weeks and we absolutely love it.

The only reason why I gave V Thai 4 stars instead of 5 would be because sometimes the menu descriptions of items are not consistent with what you are served. I&#39;m not bothered so much by it because the food is delicious and fresh every time no matter what you are served, but I can definitely understand this being frustrating to some people.

We like to eat at the restaurant because it&#39;s so quaint and it&#39;s never too crowded, and the waitresses are very nice and accommodating. It&#39;s also BYOB.

Someone called and I hear this lady apologize over and over that they can&#39;t deliver yet because they have no driver. When she hung up, she grasped her chest and said, &#34;Breaks my heart!&#34; Omg can you get any cuter?

They have lunch specials that come with egg roll and soup of the day for $7.95. Lots of selection for food like Lad Naar, my husband&#39;s favorite.

I started with a chicken pad thai to gauge their cooking. It was different from the standard pad thai that I usually get elsewhere. I&#39;d say, more soy sauce flavoring then others? It was still tasty so I&#39;m more than wiling to come back and try other dishes.

Pad Thai, Fried Rice, Nam Sod, &amp; today Spicy Szechwan. Everything has been pretty good and value wise it&#39;s ok. They give you smaller quantity in Lunch Specials and they don&#39;t give you soup if you carry out. A normal order off the lunch or dinner menu will get you more food then it&#39;s $7.95 weekday deal. 

I am glad they opened as they&#39;re a block away from work and I can walk there! Rating could deserve another star but I am still thinking about it. I will be going back and maybe the dine in exp is better than the carry out. It just kind of bugs me that I carry out lunch and don&#39;t get the soup as listed on the menu.

V-Thai came up and what sealed the deal was Michael V&#39;s picture he took of their Panang crispy wide rice noodles or N11 for short.   

I didn&#39;t have a menu but based on the photo I called and ordered N11 along with some crab rangoons.    The lady answering the phone was the sweetest lady ever.    She slowly read back my number to make sure she got it right.    She had such a pleasant demeanor especially when explaining their exact location.   I wanted to confirm to be sure it was in the same general area I&#39;m familiar with.   Afterwards I placed my order and she told me my meal would be ready in 15 minutes.

The interior of the restaurant looked nice and spacious.   There weren&#39;t too many people dining considering it was Friday night after 7.    There was only one couple and another gentleman that were inside.    

I walked towards the back as one of the ladies left to go in the back kitchen.   Another came out and confirmed my order.

Overall the food was good.  The crab rangoons were a lot smaller than I expected.    They were shaped almost like little lollipops with a wrapper extended out.    The Panang noodles had just enough of a kick to keep me interested.

Hopefully I&#39;ll get a chance to try a few more items on their menu before I move."

Also, you can&#39;t come to Thai and not expect some type of spice or heat in your food. What&#39;s amazing is that you truly get the feeling that she enjoys having you as a guest.
