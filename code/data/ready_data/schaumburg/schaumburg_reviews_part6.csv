It&#39;s a combination of deli + sandwich shop - the good version of that combination. The bad version would be a place that has a: nowhere to sit, b:no menu and c: nothing but meat. There are places like that in this area, but Asti isn&#39;t one of them.

Asti - has all of the good checkboxes checked from my above criteria - which are very detailed and specific ;)  They have a few unique/cool things here, which are that the foccacia sandwiches are extremely generous. They basically are a substantially upgraded version of subway, with all the bad parts of subway (3 pieces of sandwich bread that fall apart) fixed. So Asti bread is a nice thick two slices that don&#39;t require you to wear your sandwich on your clothes. Instead you&#39;ll wear it on your clothes because they fill the sandwiches so deep. 

Did I mention their Giardinera, which needs it&#39;s own paragraph? I should - because you can pay extra for it and it is delicious. I honestly wish they offered it more often as a condiment for their subs because of how good it is. Instead you pay 50 cents or something extra for a teaspoon. Cmon guys, I want that stuff in a jar size! Make me a sandwich *out* of Giardinera!

They do explicitly have a veggie sandwich, and also a 3 cheese sandwich. 3 cheese is good enough for my vegetarian preferences, and the provolone is nice and fresh. Also summertime has nice outdoor seating and an indoor area with giant windows open to the outside.  

At the same time, the deli itself has deli sandwiches (see photos) on top of the options from the menu of hot/cold sandwiches/other italian stuff. 

Do come here, at least once. It&#39;s absolutely worth a try."

I had the Antipasto Salad for lunch, and couldn&#39;t be happier!  The vegetables were crisp and fresh, and the salad was loaded with turkey, ham, Italian dry salami, and provolone cheese.  Their meats are magnificent; what a far cry from  other deli and sandwich places, yet prices are very reasonable. They use fresh quality ingredients and it makes a huge difference.

The salad was served with a delicious Italian roll, butter, and I opted for their homemade Italian dressing.  The salad was generous, and I couldn&#39;t finish all of it.

My 4 friends had a meatball sandwich (raved about!), pizza slices, and club sandwiches, and everyone was happy with the flavor and freshness.  I got to taste a bite of a sausage pizza slice, and it was also delicious.

Service was quick, and friendly.  Nice people run this place.  I will definitely be back to try many other menu items.  This is a good place to eat."

I used to work nearby and have eaten here many times for lunch.  Great menu options: soups/salads, pastas, sub sandwiches, Panini&#39;s, fried options, antipasto salads, artichoke &amp; bocconcini salads, olives, ...lots of good stuff!!  Servers are sooo friendly too!!

their focaccia is AWESOME. It is homemade and it is the perfect texture, light with a slightly crispy crust, not at all dense topped with plum tomatoes...I have bought whole focaccia&#39;s to take home with me.  Soups are fantastic here, come in 3 sizes and they offer a good selection daily.   You can order some soups as &#39;broth&#39; or &#39;creamy&#39; style.  The creamy chicken tortellini is very tasty and substantial, &amp; they give you a good amount of tortellini.   Cream of chicken w/rice is good too, but I will say these can be on the heavy side (they are pretty thick &amp; rich) &amp; sometimes salty as well....so you may feel the need to nap afterwards...just saying.

Italian deli meat is high quality.  The Italian sub (mortadella, capicola, salami, provolone) was really, really good!!!!  You can taste the quality in their meats.  What I didn&#39;t care for was the eggplant parmigiano focaccia sandwich....eggplant was heavily floured &amp; fried, when I really just wanted to taste more eggplant...bummer.  Slice of pizza for $2.75 is great when you need a pizza fix...Beef sandwich with melted mozzarella on focaccia was delicious!

If your in the area for lunch, they have great lunch specials.  Come by and give them a try!"

Just to let you know, I am a very regular customer, however was extremely irritated today with my visit. I ordered soup with a 6&#34; sandwich with bread and butter. When it was brought out, the bread and butter was not included. When my sister&#39;s food was delivered I asked the woman for the bread and butter I had ordered. Her response was a snotty &#34;if you want bread and butter you need to order it&#34; over her shoulder as she walked away.
When she brought me the b&amp;b a few minutes later I pointed to my order sheet which had the b&amp;b listed. She did not apologize, just walked away.

I am messaging you this here instead of posting an official review because I am a long time customer. But this kind of behavior is not acceptable. This was the brisk middle aged petite blonde woman. She has always been brisk but this was over the top rude.

I prefer to visit businesses who treat me without disrespect so I would recommend that you address this with her. If this was not the restaurant that my family picks to meet for lunches every week I would not be coming back.

**UPDATE** went to Asti&#39;s again today for our weekly family lunch, and was surprised when at the register the girls asked if I was Amelia. They had seen my review and were completely apologetic to what had happened at my last visit. They then proceeded to not only pay for my lunch but my sister&#39;s lunch who was next to me in line! It was a very sweet gesture and I appreciated that they were responsive to my complaint.

The woman I complained about last week was the one who delivered my lunch today. I don&#39;t know whether she realized I had complained or not, she didn&#39;t mention it, but was her usual brisk self, which I guess is all I can ask for... Well, I guess all I could ask for would be an apology from her directly, but oh well."

Never will there come a time where I don&#39;t crave a good bowl of soup. Winter or summer, soup is my go to meal. So naturally, I knew I would love Asti. 

This little Italian deli in Bensenville has got it going on. Normally, a restaurant&#39;s daily soup menu is underwhelming. Not at Asti. There were easily a dozen choices categorized by your think, creamy soups and your traditional stock soups. I was instantly overwhelmed. Do I go with traditional minestrone? Italian wedding? Chicken noodle? Ugh. So many good options. My husband and I went with all three. We figured leftovers in the form of soup wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing. I also went with a cucumber salad and grilled chicken breast. He went with an arrancini (rice ball) and some fried zucchini. While the soups and appetizers were nothing short of perfect, the arrancini lacked a little pizazz. Too much cheese and rice, and not enough meat and veggies. 

Service was meh. Yes, they move fast when the line is out the door, but the friendliness was&#39;t there. I felt rushed and felt like I could ask questions about the menu without a dose of &#39;tude. I don&#39;t appreciate being served that. Additionally, I got the third degree and some snickers when I asked for a plain chicken breast. Some people eat healthy (shocking, I know), not to mention I was getting married in a month. No bloating allowed.

Overall though, I&#39;ll return again and again. Asti has the soup market on lockdown. Come on, where else can you go where you can choose from a list of about 12 of their homemade soups for the day? Even Panera can&#39;t compete with that."

I drove west down Irving Park Road and got a little nervous that I would be driving forever...until I smelled the fragrant aroma of garlic and made a quick turn into the Asti Italian Foods parking lot. 

Many years ago, I wandered in here on a whim. Thinking back, I can&#39;t remember anything about that visit. I&#39;m glad that I found my way back yesterday!

I walked in and I was immediately overwhelmed. There are food displays with some specials for you to look at, the menu board is huge, the available soups have their own board, they have pizza by the slice and there&#39;s even a deli case with other available deliciousness to fill your tummy. The girl taking my order quickly offered me a handheld menu to help reduce the bells &amp; whistles going off in my head. There&#39;s still a lot to look at that way, but it was definitely more manageable. 

I went for 12 oz. of chicken tortellini soup and a calamari. I wanted to try their meatballs or maybe some chicken parmigiano, but had to remind myself that I can&#39;t try everything in one visit. :-)

Ordering was easy (once I knew what I wanted). The girl behind the counter jotted it down and gave me a piece of paper to hand to the girl at the register. I started to chat with the woman in line before me.  She was new to Asti too and seemed overwhelmed as well, but we managed and she was out the door pretty quickly. When I got to the register, I noticed some air-tight containers housing some pretty nice looking (homemade) cookies. I added one. Then realized that they are two for $1. So what would any reasonable person do? I added two. When she was bagging them up, she noticed that part of one of the cookies had broken off. She tossed in a third cookie for good measure. Thanks!!!    

I waited a few more minutes than I would have liked for my to-go order, but when it arrived, I found that everything had been wrapped up beautifully. It made the ten minute drive back to my office without getting cold. The soup container was wrapped in plastic wrap so it was still steaming hot when I opened it. Nice job Asti!  

The calamari arrived on a bed of fries (eh to the fries...) but they worked well to catch the excess oil from the calamari. There was marinara sauce, a cup of Cole slaw, some lemon wedges and a couple ketchup packets included. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that they asked if I wanted bread &amp; butter. I said sure and it was wrapped beautifully like everything else, but it was not as fresh as I had hoped. If I was a dunker - as in a girl who dunks bread in her soup - it would have been perfect. But alas, I am not. Sadly the bread went to waste. 

The oatmeal raisin walnut cookies. They deserve a review all their own. They were THAT good. Soft and chewy. Fresh. Flavorful. Soooo yummy!  I had every intention of sharing with a co-worker but once I had a bite, she missed out. I saved the extra for today and they were just as great with my leftover soup which reheated fabulously!  

I wish I could tell you more but I can&#39;t. I have to go back to experience more.  I&#39;m thinking you should check it out too. And get a cookie...or two."

No subways, no Jimmy John&#39;s as the chain fast food joints shouldn&#39;t  even exist in the Chicagoland.  We orders the 12&#34; prosciutto sub and focaccia salami sub.

They have great sandwiches, really excellent soups that must be homemade (they taste that good), and the pizza is great if you like &#39;bite,&#39; but minimal sogginess versus those sauce-heavy pizzas out there.

I&#39;ve seen them for years kind-of-sort-of, but they mix in with some of the high-end auto body shops here in Bensenville... perhaps they should put some signage closer to the street like &#34;Italian Subs Here!&#34; or something, lol.

Sandwiches! The bread is fresh and they offer a variety of styles. I like the french, as it&#39;s soft and yet crusty; just how it should be. The toppings are really good looking since the place is a deli, and that affords them (and us customers!) the luxury of fresh-sliced meats. Add-ons like lettuce, tomato and other toppings look ripe and never hour-old.

Soups! Really, this area surprised me since I expect a Polish deli to have excellent soups, but NOT an Italian deli. While the soups tend to cover the standard &#39;Americanized&#39; range (cream of chicken, minnestrone and the like), they are all just so tasty and don&#39;t feel sourced from some mass-supplier to restaurants. I love Italian Wedding soup and it&#39;s so salty at Portillo&#39;s (love them though); Asti has an excellent version and the sodium is reduced to a level that makes it perfect. Also, their cream soups are really CREAM soups. They taste 100% creamy and there was certainly no attempt to hide what *should* be great quality with low-end fillers like milk or water (I&#39;m looking at you, Panera!) Seriously, try a cream of (your fave) soup; satisfaction guaranteed.

That&#39;s it for now. Love the place and the employees are always buzzing around and working. Prices are a touch lower than Jimmy John&#39;s and very on par with Panera. I like Gina&#39;s Hotdogs, which is almost next door, but Asti&#39;s soup and sandwich pairings make lunch my favorite time of the workday!

Sometimes they take while to make your ready in the lunch hours because of the rush but the food is always good."

I came here for the 1st time to pick up lunch today and after a couple spoonfuls of my Chicken Noodle soup there was an inch long piece of hair in it...just absolutely disgusting. I called to let them know immediately and the only thing they could offer me was a &#34;Free replacement of the same soup&#34;. Are you kidding me! You are offering me the same soup the hair was floating in. I am a big fan of the soup/sandwich combo and this is a place that I will never go to again!"

Visited Asti for the first time today and it was all I hoped it would be. My boss was strongly recommending this place after trying it when he saw them on Chicago&#39;s Best. I love soup, so he told me I had to try the soup.Yum! I had the Cream of Chicken with Rice soup and it was as good as I have ever had. Definitely tasted fresh and homemade. I bought the Wedding soup to go for lunch tomorrow, so I haven&#39;t tried it yet, but if it is as good as the other I tried, I will really look forward to my lunch at work. I had the day off, so I ate in and it was very cozy, clean and inviting. Nice Italian atmosphere. The service was great and the owner/manager(?) and staff were very friendly. I ordered the Chicken Parm. sandwich, which was very good and got to also try the Italian Sub. Leftovers to go with my Wedding Soup! I definitely want to be a repeat customer here. You must try it!"

Pasta was so over cooked they should be ashamed to call themselves an Italian deli. They used to have a good Italian wedding soup, and now it&#39;s like they took leftover minestrone(that&#39;s what it tasted like to me) added some extras and call it wedding soup. I have never had a wedding soup with tomato based broth it&#39;s always been chicken. I have given this place more chances than I would any other establishment, but they keep disappointing.

In fact, this is a family owned (&amp; operated), traditional style Italian Ristorante serving AMAZING thin crust pizza for 30 years...
Nothin average schmaverage here...

For an unassuming Pizzeria and Ristorante - Mamma Maria&#39;s conjures some excellent pizza and Italian dishes quite affordably.  Run by the Calzante family, it is obvious they truly care about quality, friendly service, good food, and fresh ingredients....a true sign of Italians passionate about cooking and sharing their love of food....
(they even have a lovely garden behind restaurant).

I was here for a celebration a few years ago and the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and ULTRA accommodating.  They went above and beyond to ensure all drinks were filled, no platters left empty, wine on tables and all special requests were handled with ease...Everyone felt like they were treated as family.  The owner&#39;s, Cira &amp; Joe were fabulous.  Cira checked on everyone multiple times while engaging with our party.......nothing went unnoticed...

When you walk in, you will find a comfortable and tastefully decorated dining area &amp; separate section for pick-up orders.  They have a private room for parties which can accommodate roughly 20-25 people.  The food (great focaccia, various specialty pizza&#39;s, bruschetta, fried calamari and pasta) was well prepared, cooked perfectly and even picky Italian eater&#39;s were impressed! 

It had been a while since I had a delicious thin crust from here - and I was craving pizza (when don&#39;t I crave pizza?)  Just getting over a nasty cold, I decided I would treat myself and drive over to Mamma Maria&#39;s for a fix...(I desperately needed one &amp; was happy to have my appetite back).  I decided on ALL mushroom ( love mushrooms), half spinach &amp; ricotta - half sausage.  Sounds like a great combination doesn&#39;t it?  Well, I&#39;m here to tell you, I picked a winner...

The perfect amount of fresh spinach leaves combined with scattered mounds of good quality ricotta (not the grocery store bought kind), and mushrooms......all a match made in heaven.  I was quite impressed with my topping selection.  These ingredients blended perfectly - and all I can say is, mmmm......Molto delizioso!
Great sausage.  You could taste a little kick of spice and the fennel was present, but not predominate, overall, very good. 

I really love the thin crust here.  Great amount of texture, chewy, good bite - it is definitely more of a &#39;well done&#39; type.  They also offer double dough, pan &amp; even stuffed....Honestly, I had forgotten how good this pizza is.....

Upon picking up my pie, I even received a complimentary key chain!  Very nice touch I might add.  How often do you receive anything &#39;free&#39; these days &amp; who couldn&#39;t use yet another key chain stashed in their drawer?   

If you decide to dine-in or at home (they deliver also) I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised eating most anything here, but one thing is for sure - outstanding pizza...

Ps..better than White Cottage &amp; Giordano&#39;s, SLAMS Nardi&#39;s &amp; KILLS Aurielio&#39;s (their pizza is gross anyway). Totally worthy of 5 stars all across the board....

Use the Yelp check-in &amp; receive $5 off your order of $25 or more..."

Tonight my husband and I took my in-laws out for their 66th wedding anniversary and this was the restaurant they chose. It&#39;s close to their home so I thought that this was the reason why they wanted to go. 

NO!!!!!!  It&#39;s because Mamma Maria&#39;s is a freakin&#39; fantastic place to eat and enjoy being Italian (they are Italian). This is the thing, my mother in-law prides herself on making her own food (she&#39;s an 89 year-old full-blooded Italian lady, why would she go out to eat right).

Our server was Stephanie. She was quick witted, efficient with service and dealt with our unruly table appropriately. We were unruly because we had two people that have been married for 66 years ordering food. That&#39;s something that not every server can handle gracefully. She figured out the love birds right away and sorted out their issues like a pro. I laughed at her super server abilities and relaxed knowing I wouldn&#39;t have to decipher what they were really saying and so on. Secondly, my husband and his father were fighting over who would pay for the bill.  Back and forth and oh boy the drama.  If only I had a camera I could film Sopranos Part Deux. She was great! 

The food was just as delightful. I&#39;ll be go honest, I wasn&#39;t expecting much because I thought it was just pretty much a pizza place. The thing is that there is a pizza by the slice/pizza by the whole situation on the North of the restaurant and then if you open the southern doors, there are some sit down, get fat, eat some authentic Italian delights shenanigans going on. 

I had Chicken Saltimbocca that was seasoned perfectly. I love salty food and this was just that. Not in a bad way, it was supposed to be salty. Saltimbocca means &#34;jumps in the mouth&#34; by the way, isn&#39;t that cute? My hubby had the Veal Saltimbocca and he cleared his plate, saying over and over again how good it was. I brought 3/4 of my meal home because it was quite a bit of food and I had already pigged out on the fresh bread.  No more room! 

My mother-in-law couldn&#39;t get over how great her Chicken Limon was and this was somewhat because she and my father in-law had only ordered the pizzas from here before. They hadn&#39;t realized that there was a sit down option or how fantastic it would be. But, you know, sometimes that&#39;s just how life is. You&#39;ve got to open doors to make some discoveries."

1. Calamari- light, flaky breading. Not rubbery. Cooked perfectly! 

2. Pizza- this is not Chicago style deep dish. This is true thin crust Italian pizza. Overall the pizza was good. I&#39;d rate that more at 3.5 stars. The crust was light and crispy but the sauce and cheese is where it lost points. The sauce was a bit bland, and the cheese seemed a bit over cooked. However, the sausage was incredible! You can tell they use fresh, homemade sausage! 

3. Stuffed shells- this is where Mamma Maria&#39;s shines in my opinion. This pasta dish was absolutely incredible! Starting from the ricotta cheese stuffing to the perfectly cooked pasta shells! The portion size was very heathy, just the way my Grandma would serve me. And speaking of my grandma, the marinara sauce that accompanied the shells was the closest to the way my grandma use to make hers! I was told that every morning the chefs come in and make a huge pot of sauce and use that as their base for the many other sauce options they have. 

4. Cannoli- last but not least. This classic, traditional  pastry was an absolute delight while eating it. Everyone has their own flare when it comes to the nuts that cannoli&#39;s are dipped into. Here, they use pistachios! This saltier then normal nut was such a great accompaniment to the sweet filling, adding a great balance of sweet and salty! 

Hands down, the best place for authentic, homemade Italian food! If you&#39;re in the area, be sure to check them out!"

We started off with grilled calamari. It was delicious!  The dipping sauce was good. 

I had the grilled salmon with spinach &amp; vesuvio potatoes. The lemon &amp; oil sauce was so good! It paired really well. My salmon was grilled to perfection. 

My dinner date ordered the tilapia. The wine broth was tasty. The fish was tender and perfectly flavored. I didn&#39;t taste the dirty taste I generally taste with tilapia. I&#39;d probably order it myself next time. 

I was pleasantly surprised to receive a $5 off coupon after checking into yelp. I&#39;m a baller on a budget so I like to save when I can.

We decided to enjoy an early dinner and I was anticipating a crispy, thin crust delight.  Sadly, that was not the case.

We started out with a dozen baked clams and they were dry and not particularly flavorful.  In terms of size, yes they were larger than the quarter size clams you get at most restaurants but not nearly as large or delicious as the ones at Toscanis or Rocco Vinos.

My wife ordered the penne with shrimp in a vodka sauce.  This was the highlight of the meal.  The vodka sauce was quite good and the shrimp were tender and succulent.  This dish was very good.

I ordered a medium Florentine pizza which includes spinach, ricotta and fresh garlic.  The first two end pizzas were fine except the crust wasn&#39;t really crispy.  Once I delved into one of the interior pieces it seemed that the crust was not cooked all the way through.  I asked my wife to sample and she agreed.  I asked the server if she could have the cook re-fire it a bit to finish baking the interior.  She said she could have the cook make a new one but I didn&#39;t think that was necessary.  OK, no problem.  About 10 minutes later she returned with the original pizza.  I could tell that they left it in enough to just slightly brown all of the toppings.  The toppings were very hot and, yes the crust was now baked.  The crust was not crispy as I hoped.  The toppings were very good but the crust really detracted from a potentially good pizza.
We will probably give Mama Maria&#39;s another try some time down the road but last night&#39;s experience was just &#34;Meh&#34;."

Love the food! Frequently ordered carry-out.. But my girlfriends and I have dined in many times. 
The pizza is decent... Much better than Nancy&#39;s down the street.

The grilled calamari is sooo delicious!!! I usually order grilled salmon or lemon chicken. With spinach.. And tiramisu for dessert. Yummy :)!!

When dining in, I&#39;ve ordered dirty martinis, and we&#39;ve had the house wine a few times. Very good. Strong drinks

I&#39;ve never had a problem with this place, the staff is friendly and attentive. My food always taste wonderful.
Service is a bit slow. But that&#39;s not a deal breaker. Carry-out is the best option for me anyway, so I was never disappointed with Mamma Maria&#39;s.

Oh and our bill can get a bit high, but still worth it. You get what you pay for? ;)"

We walked in a bit stressed. The place was a little more than half full, we got seated right away. she needed to use the rest room, I told our waitress we where a bit stressed right away I ordered her a cocktail and as she returned she was getting her drink...OK , happy woman, happy man. I then ordered my own cocktail and we looked over the menu.
My cocktail came and I ordered the caprese. 
We placed our order for the main course and a bottle of wine. she had gnocchi, I had veal picatta,Both dishes where served with salad or soup, I believe the dressing she got was house made, very good. I had the soup and it was very good.
The waitress was friendly and on point, very good service. Very good food.
So why not 5 stars? The cocktails seemed a little on the small side and her came ungarnished. After our experience earlier my expectations where low.
SO I will have to go back, and give them a chance to earn another star. I&#39;m sure they will...."

She doesn&#39;t even like sausage on her pizza, but she kept on saying how good it was. I liked it. It just wasn&#39;t great to me. The pizza gets three stars. I&#39;m definitely going back to try other pizzas and will take my wife to have dinner on the restaurant side. Service is very good. When going in to pick up everything was ready on time.

My family and I used to go here at least 1 a week because it was so close to home and it had pretty decent food for a a good price.  Unfortunately, the service has sent us elsewhere.  

The first strike was when my entire family went in for dinner and there was 6 of us total the table.  My dad got the bill and stamped all over the receipt in red was &#34; A 22% service fee has been automatically added&#34; 22%?????? Are they serious? I feel 18% is the standard automatic service fee these days.  The next time we were in, we asked the waitress that we LOVE and she was completely surprised and said that was not usual for Mamma Marias.  

The second strike we got the same waitress that issued the automatic 22% service fee.  I picked up dinner for the 4 of us and the bill came out to be $74.  A week went by and I was looking at my credit card charges.  The waitress had ran my credit card through twice, which is completely understandable, it happens, however the two charges did not even match what I had signed for.  Luckily, I kept the receipt!  I explained to my dad how weird the double charge was, so he decided to go into Mamma Marias to speak to a manager.

Which leads me to the third strike.... the manager was so extremely rude to my dad.  He basically called my dad a liar on both encounters and said that their cash register won&#39;t even allow a 22% service fee??   A good business man would have told his customer that he will look into the receipts, follow up with the server, and get back to him.  Not this guy!  My dad was so embarrassed that it had gotten to this level that he told the manager he had lost all of our business and we will go elsewhere.  

I wanted to at least share this, so that anyone that goes there is careful when it comes to paying the bill!!"

Their food is consistenly great and authentic tasting, their pickup service is always accurate, everything is always fresh and hot, when dining in our waitresses are always attentive, and the owner makes a point to walk around and mingle w/customers when possible.  

We just had a smaller party of 15 there for my 30th Birthday and people are still ranting about the food and personalized service!  We recommend this place to anyone and everyone we possibly can.  Only downfall is some nights are really busy and no real &#34;waiting area&#34; to sit and wait for a table to open up.  Definitely worth the wait though and single-handly one of the best pizza&#39;s in the burbs!"

The pizza was good and so was the service.  However, the last couple of times we have ordered the pizza has changed and now tastes terrible.  On top of that, the last time we ordered the pizza took over an hour and a half to get here and when we opened the box it looked like it had sat in the car for that whole time.  It was luke warm.  My wife called and they told us we could get a new one out or get a credit.  We took the credit.  The following week when we decided to use the credit we were told it was only for $10, which we were not told when we first called and that is their standard credit for cold pizza.  I would have been better off getting a tombstone.  HALF off for a cold pizza?  Poor business."

Cheese was cooked to perfection, with the majority of the pizza just on the edge of turning brown, and scattered browned cheese throughout. My only grievance would be the sauce, it is a little on the sweet and thin side, but that is a matter of preference, so if you like the sweeter sauces this place may be 5 stars for you."

Mast Masala is just aces, I&#39;m sorry, it is amazing. However, it is far from my house. Imagine my luck when I realized this was right down the street! 

I have stopped in twice and both times, I was amazed with the level of service and sense of urgency the staff has! Both times, I have ordered the Butter Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Masala. A few days ago, I got the lunch specials of both, and I kind of regretted it, only because the lunch special portion was HUGE! You get a portion of your entree, with rice, and salad. I also ordered the deep-fried bread because they do not have naan(tragically). 

The only real criticism I have of the food is that I feel it is lacking salt. It tastes pretty good as is, but I find adding a bit of salt to my food enhances it tenfold. Definitely a good place for an Indian food novice to test the waters. The staff is always kind and the food comes out hot and FAST. Check it out!"

I was first recommended Indian Bistro by my co-workers and bosses who are Indian and has quoted it &#34; Best Indian food outside of India&#34;.  That is a big statement so I decided  why not.  As long as I have a toilet in close proximity at all times the day I decided to eat it.

We walked in on a weeknight, we were greeted by a nice gentleman who I believe is the owner.  We asked him for recommendations and he recommended the chicken tikka masala and goat tikka masala.  Being novice Indian food consumers, we also asked for &#34;THE pita&#34; which of course we meant &#34;Roti&#34;.  Duh.

We sat and waited...   oh maybe 30-40 minutes :(  Not because they were moving slow...  but because they were very busy with to-go orders.  Hey, we understand, business is good and we have to wait our turn.  But, I would have appreciated some heads up that it may take a little longer or some kind of ETF(Estimated Time of Food).  

Having said that, it was all well worth the wait.  Everything was Fantastic!  What I didn&#39;t like though was that even though we were dining there, they still put everything in to-go containers.  I especially did not like the piping hot tikka masala in the plastic container...You know why.

If you do decide to go there and eat there, you might want to consider not wearing your best outfit.  Since they have an open kitchen, by the time we were done, I was covered in all of the fragrant scents.  Next time I&#39;ll have to order to-go or bring a shower cap and a garbage bag.

One thing to note here is that they are CASH ONLY! There are no ATMs in the shopping strip so make sure to come with your benjies or georgies or however you roll.

I&#39;ve been back many many times since then and the food is excellent every time!  Indian food for life!"

I was out driving around one night, trying to kill time and find some dinner. This came up in my Yelp stream and I thought &#34;YES&#34;. I&#39;m gonna try it - perfect. Found the place no problem, right across from the Home Depot in Palatine in a little strip center. 

When you walk in, it&#39;s a long, narrow restaurant. There&#39;s a bunch of little tables along the side of the wall (typical quick lunch place), not really for formal dinners or anything. 
I reviewed the menu, was greeted by a super-friendly man who took my order, and they proceeded to cook everything fresh right then and there! 

I&#39;d say I waited about ten minutes, which is totally reasonable and I was in no rush. I was enjoying taking it all it - and seeing how this place runs. 

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masalla - which is my most favorite Indian dish there is. I was not overly stoked with their version of it. It was a bit more &#34;yellow&#34; than the typical bright orange, and very creamy. It was still good, it just wasn&#39;t my favorite. The chicken itself seemed good, and the rice was primo. Their Samosas were to DIE FOR. VERY good. One thing i was very disappointed in was they do not carry Naan!! Who doesn&#39;t carry naan? It&#39;s a staple item.

Portion size was ok. 

PRICES: 
Samosa $2.99, 
Chicken Tikka Masala $8.99, 
Extra rice $1.75, 
Can of Coke $1.00, 
= all together came to $16.21 for ONE meal. 

Prices seem somewhat fair compared to local indian places. Portions could be just a smidge larger so maybe there&#39;s leftovers for next day and then it would seem more like two meals.

I haven&#39;t been EXCITED about a place in a long time. I think between the fact that the folks here were so nice, and that they&#39;re trying to make good, fresh, food - I&#39;m hopeful for this place to really succeed and I will recommend to all! I think I&#39;ll come back and maybe try to broaden my Indian tastes (and always order samosas)."

Watch out for the Chicken 65 and Aloo 65 (potato/veg version) if you are a newbie!  I suggested this to a friend who was new to Indian cuisine and both of our mouths were on fire!!  Kind of a little dry too.

Loved the big samosas and the chutneys on the side!  That was delish.  Overall the prices are reasonable and service is friendly.  There are about 10 tables and it does get busy at lunch time.  Definitely recommend placing your order 15-20 minutes ahead of time for pick-up or dine-in so it is ready when you arrive!

Minus one star for not having naan on the menu!  They have this other thin kind of tortilla like bread. Not as good as naan."

Actually, I&#39;ve been here many years ago and didn&#39;t think much of the food, however, something magical happened and it&#39;s quite good. For the amount of food and it&#39;s price, it&#39;s a good deal. One entree can feed two people (with extra rice or bread) - or be like me and get carry out so you have leftovers for lunch the next day. Tastes even better.

As everyone have said here, food is cooked on the spot. You can see the stove behind the counter. Fresh and hot off the kitchen!

Yes, the guys are really nice. I like the way they talk, Thank you sir, here you go dear. Old school India. Even the TVs are old school CRTs playing Bollywood movies. Photos of India and customers are posted on the wall.

Good food, good people. Support small and local business!"

When we pulled up, I must say I had my concerns seeing that is was a little strip mall shop where you place the order at the register and they call out your name when your order is ready.

One nice thing bout the set-up is that you can see them cooking your food in the front of the shop so you know that cleanliness is important to them since the area was immaculate."

I&#39;ve passed this Lil gem tons of times tonight I stopped I got chicken Tikka marsala  I think it what it&#39;s called. I requested it a bit spicy it came with basmati rice. The food was amazing so flavorful. The place is tiny but full of families eating and enjoying themselves. The guy at the register was very kind and helped me along. The only reason I&#39;m not giving this five is because I&#39;m my personal opinion the Meal was small and should have came with nann.

We ordered the paneer tikka masala. The taste was really good, the only concern I had is there were only 3 big pieces of paneer. It would be really nice if they added more paneer or had small cubes of paneer.
The veggie biryani we ordered was very average.

Indian Bistro has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago and have yet to eat at another Indian restaurant that is better. You simply cannot beat their signature biryani - it&#39;s flavorful and aromatic with a crunchy texture from the fried onions with perfectly cooked rice. I&#39;ve had this at several other restaurants but it just cannot match the level of flavor at Indian Bistro. It&#39;s impressive at how well the flavors and textures blend together in this one dish. I can see why the owners are so proud of their biryani - try asking them.

I have cravings for Indian Bistro every month where I get withdrawal symptoms. Every time I am here, it is so hard for me not to order the chicken tikka masala and the butter chicken. Their tikka masala is nirvana in a bowl - it&#39;s that amazing. It leaves me speechless each time and pondering how something so good could only be $8.99. 

Simply put, Indian Bistro simply costs less and tastes better than other places. I&#39;m sure that there are plenty of other Indian restaurants with a better décor but Indian Bistro makes everything to order. You won&#39;t find large vats of food that just sit there for hours and it makes all the difference. Some places just reheat food that they had prepared earlier but that&#39;s not the case here. At Indian Bistro, you&#39;ll see your food being made since the kitchen is right behind the counter. 

Indian Bistro is the Bomb[ay]!"

The food is amazing and is not cooked in a mystery kitchen hidden in the back. They cook the food out in the dining area. 
My wife and I usually take it to go and the food is always ready fairly quickly. If it was any faster, would be a little suspicious.

He had the chef use extra spicy seasonings that created such a stinch that it nearly cleared the entire place (NOT KIDDING...PEOPLE SCATERED).

I ordered two Kathi rolls, one paneer and one chicken and asked them to make it ridiculously spicy.

To start with they made everything fresh and right in front of me.  He cut up the veg&#39;s and peppers and added the panner and chicken and wrapped it up in a large roti (basically a burrito) and gave it to me to go.  $5 each, which is well worth it.  I have had Kathi rolls all over the world and I have to say....these are the best.  On my drive home I was in heaven...the combination of the spice with the paneer and the gravy was all just perfect.  Even the Chicken one was to die for.  Also the quantity was significant.  Some places when you get a Kathi roll it is tiny with minimal filling and more Roti...this place, the roti was bursting with stuffing...so much so that my shirt had a taste of both Kathi rolls on my way home.

Don&#39;t let the exterior of this restaurant deceive you..... It is a diamond in the rough...Although not the best place or most comfortable place to have a meal...it is ideal for takeout or a quick lunch.....I can&#39;t wait to go back and try other items on the menu."

I have to be honest, after my first visit to Indian Bistro I was fully prepared to lay down 3-stars. The food was just fine and while I enjoyed the salty pickles eaten with the Aloo 65 appetizer, I felt like if I hadn&#39;t ordered the salty pickle side, the Aloo 65 would have been a bit too dry for my liking. They should consider bundling those things together. 

The palak paneer was just fine but the cheese cubes were tinier than tiny and there were only 3 in the whole dish... seemed like kind of a rip. And I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the bread made with potato, again, felt like it was kind of dry. Our bill for those 3 things was a little over $21, so not the cheapest but it was cooked fresh on the spot and the portions on most items were pretty generous from what we could tell by looking around the packed counter-service restaurant on a Friday night at 9pm. 

The space was cramped and the 2 tables that weren&#39;t full were pretty dirty but it was close to closing and they were busy so I can&#39;t fault them for that. The guys behind the counter were both knowledgeable and patient and appeared to work well under pressure. 

I left full, with a small container of leftovers that would probably be enough for an appetizer for one before another meal, but not overly impressed with anything I&#39;d had that day besides the pickle and Aloo match I&#39;d put together. I shoved our Indian Bistro remnants in the fridge and forgot about them until 2 days later when I was late night fridge-lurking. I wasn&#39;t really in the mood for it but out of dinner despair, I popped them in the microwave and carved  spot out on the couch for myself so I could eat like a true American, while watching mostly commercials with minor interruptions of regularly scheduled programming. 

The first bite: Whoa.  
Second bite: Stupendous
Third bite: Extraordinary
Fourth bite: Holy Wow
Fifth bite: Best thing ever
Sixth bite: I want to eat this forever!
Seventh bite: Gone. Now I am sad. 

The next time I get Indian Bistro I will most def be doing carry-out (even though it&#39;s super annoying how Indian restaurant have to use the 10 million containers to package things to go), waiting a day to eat and then indulging in the sweet and euphoric taste of India."

The food looks, tastes, and IS made-to-order, in no way does it taste &#34;fast&#34;.  We ordered lamb rogan josh, and definitely got lamb curry, but once I saw it, I didn&#39;t complain, we ate it all. Tava roti is big, thin, hot, and buttered. Chili chicken was awesome.  The chicken biriyani did not taste like traditional chicken biriyani.   The quality of the rice was A+ and it was loaded with crunchy fried onion and bits of tomato (?). Different but good. I think the food is made based on the place&#39;s own interpretation but I liked it.  This place definitely did not have any of the red flags one must watch out for when visiting Indian restaurants.  Okay, so they went with plastic ware, and this sounds stupid, but its sturdy and premium.   I will say that the food wasn&#39;t spicy, but it was really really hot and fresh. I would come back."

I walked in and saw a huge long list on the wall of different food choices. I decided not to focus much attention on it since I really wouldn&#39;t have known much about the description from looking at it. I walked up to the counter and explained that I am an Indian food newbie, and the man took the time to ask my likes and dislikes and then suggested that I try the lamb kiddai. I also got an order of samosas and waited about ten minutes for takeout.

I got home and tried my food, which had been packaged up with great care. Delicious!!! So flavorful and he was spot on with what I might like. I&#39;m already craving it again and maybe next time I will get even more adventurous!

I did eat take out last night (my girlfriend picked it up on her way to my place) and all I can say is OMG was it good!

I live just off Devon Avenue so I know a thing or two about Indian restaurants in Chicago. It can be a real hit-or-miss proposition... but we had three dishes plus the veggie samosas and it was 4 for 4. We had: chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and palak paneer. The meat dishes were incredible, the sauces were perfect (my girlfriend thought the vindaloo to be a bit spicy but I didn&#39;t think so). The portions were generous enough that we both ate ourselves into a mild food coma, and she took the palak paneer for lunch today (I&#39;m splitting the leftover tikka masala and vindaloo with a corworker). That&#39;s a lot of meals.

The samosas came with a green chutney and a brownish liquid sauce (I&#39;m not sure what it is)... I had one for breakfast just a few minutes ago with the chutney, and even warmed up it was awesome, not bad for a fried, filled pastry. 

Indian Bistro is much better than half the restaurants on Devon in my estimation. I&#39;ll revise my review after I actually eat there, but based on what I had thus far, I highly recommend them!"

Prices.... Much more reasonable than those show off fancy restaurants such as India House! It is much more cheaper, delicious, fresh! You will definitely not regret this place. Go there and enjoy! Make sure you get their Thumbs Up (Indian Coke) because Indian food tastes awesome with Coke, Samosas, Chat, Egg Bhurji! Love it!"

I went here once a year ago and I was impressed. However, they have really, really upped their game here. Not only is the curry delicious and their spicing perfect, but their meats are delcious, tender, and fresh.

The owner made a fresh batch of carrot yogurt and offered it to us while we waited for our take out to finish cooking. This place was good enough to convince a first timer to try Indian food.

Flavorful, great to look at and superb taste (slightly on the spicier side for non-Indians). 

While most places serve colored rice mixed with meat chunks or vegetables in the name of biryani, their version is as close it has gotten to the original fare I have sampled in Hyderabad. The curry was tasty as well - the salt and spices were well balanced, good flavor and well cooked. 10/10 will go there again!"

They were both flavored &#34;hot&#34; although my tolerance for spice is pretty high, so that may or may not be a point of contention.

Both dishes had an incredibly deep layering of flavors that, surprisingly, did not fight against each other instead growing in strength, one after another, in a very delightful and surprising way. While other Indian restaurants may serve tasty dishes that have one or two distinct flavors to them, these two dishes were far more complex and very enjoyable.

Texture-wise, the biryani was a complex orchestration of soft, crunchy, and meaty surprises which was as enjoyable as it was interesting.

On a final note, this is not a restaurant in the sense of waiters and chefs and the like. It is very much a &#34;joint&#34;, if you will, but the food is amazing, and I believe that whoever designed the recipes put his or her heart and soul into them."

Tonight was the night! 

I&#39;d rather give this place 3.5 stars as I think it needs another visit or two in order to confirm its rating. But overall, I was pretty satisfied with the place. I ordered chicken sagwala to go. They asked me what level of spiciness I wanted, which is good. When I got home, I was a little disappointed at first as it appeared that there may not be enough rice, and the sauce seemed to be a little runnier than I prefer. But when the rice and sagwala were mixed together, it was all OK and the combination made for a tasty meal. I also ordered some roti to go with it. I was a little disappointed that they did not have any naan on their menu, but the roti was OK. 

I did notice that their current health score was a 74, which is below their previous two scores and a little lower than what I would care to see. I hope they keep the place up - I plan to return to try more items and update my ratings accordingly."

I ordered el pastor tacos and the hubs got the enchilada burrito -- two of his favorite mexican dishes in one, so he was really excited.

I&#39;m glad to say that there are comparable places in Bartlett to our old haunts :) We saw the review for North of the Border when we moved in, and were glad to see that it&#39;s less than 10 minutes from our house. Husband and I came one night without the kiddo to check out the joint. First of....THEY DELIVER...and THEY DELIVER TO MY HOUSE! This is extremely exciting, considering we were in the barren wasteland of non-delivery in our old home! Second, they have a good assortment of foods that you would find in a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint and a more established Mexican/American restaurant. I appreciate that they have meals, where I can get my tacos, a drink, and chips and guac at a very reasonable price. I also enjoy their salsas, which are made in-house. I definitely suggest asking for extras, as you&#39;ll love the flavor of the green and the creamy red! When eating in, the service is great, especially since I can never make a decision and asked the girl at the counter a million questions! I&#39;d definitely suggest the skirt steak tacos! They have a great texture, and feel a little more upscale for only .33 extra per taco :) We&#39;ve come back multiple times since...husband settling on the breakfast burrito as his favorite and me with my staple tacos.

In fact this place instantly became one of my go-to places if I need to order food for my family again. I only rated it 4 stars because i think the prices could be a little less. But again no matter how low the prices are, it will never be low enough for people unless they get it for free :)"

Chips and guacamole arrived quickly, but it was loaded with cilantro and tons of stems. Yuck. After a 35 minute wait for two plates of enchiladas, we were presented with hot food. This was a plus. Unfortunately, the enchiladas are now made with flour tortillas (since May 2013) and if I had read the apparently changed menu, I would have known this. Instead, I gnawed at one of my chewy enchiladas and called it a day. I&#39;m guessing I can get corn tortillas upon request. 

Overall, with a not so pleasing dinner, too long of a wait, kids slamming into us for our 45 minute visit and a less than tidy seating area, I can&#39;t imagine that I&#39;ll be back anytime soon."

First I think they microwaved our burrito suizo.  How can I tell?  They use Styrofoam containers and there was a hole in one where the container melted.

I also think the beans and enchiladas sauce is something you can buy at Jewel.

Next the Nacho&#39;s.  They were a disaster, a container of soggy chips, cheese, and meat.  If you wanted to eat, you get plenty.  Just hold your nose.

The taco bell across the street is better."

Cashier was friendly and pleasant to deal with.

Then, I got my order. The portion size was small just as expected (hence the price). The flavor, however, was nothing to write home about. The enchilada sauce that they use has a strange after taste. They use flour tortillas to make enchiladas? Who uses anything other than CORN tortillas for enchiladas? At least make a half hearted effort to make your Mexican cuisine seem... Um Mexican!"

Okay, we ordered 8 steak tacos, Mexican style. Had maybe 8 little cuts of dried, unseasoned steak per taco, wilted cilantro, dried up limes, and a huge handful of raw onions. The steak had zero flavor at all. We also had three chicken tamales, which basically seemed like they steamed unseasoned chicken breast into a basic tamale. No sauce, no seasoning at all..,not even a dash of salt!  We had to doctor all the food up with our own guacamole and salsa to make it edible in the least. We also ordered a steak burrito with chile lime sauce, and what a shock. The sauce was flavorless.  We would have been better off eating lean cuisine Mexican meals...at least those have some flavor. 

Will not order from here again."

I went in and ordered  the taco dinner. The girl at the counter snapped at me with attitude &#34;what side do you want?&#34; Horrible customer service throughout  the purchase. $10+ for a taco dinner (rice &amp; beans)with a drink.  No chips &amp; salsa. The dining room was mostly clean, but a wall of crosses struck me as odd and could be offensive to some. I felt like I was in a church. 

My food came pretty fast and the plate looked pretty good. The rice was clumpy, tasteless and reminded me of school lunch food. The beans had a little flavor but it was not good. Very plain. I expect above average sides from a small mom and pop type joint. Not the case here. 

The tacos I chose were steak. The meat had no taste except for salt. The quality of the meat was low grade. I had many pieces of grizzle that I had to spit out. Lettuce, tomato, and cheese came standard with double shell soft corn tortillas. The steak was so bland, I had to drench it in the various off the shelf taco sauces including Valentina, Cholula, and two flavors of tobasco. No house sauces were offered to me. They did have Chinese Sriracha sauce though.  I like places that have their own sauces that you can&#39;t get anywhere else. Not the case here. 

I tried different sauces on each taco which helped the flavor. Then I tried putting  the jalapeño Tabasco sauce all over the rice and beans because I know I like that. I use it all the time. To my horror, the sauce was ransid and ruined my rice and beans. I looked on the bottle and it had expired two months prior. I brought the bottle to girl at the counter told her that it was bad and tastes horrible. She said &#34;oh&#34; and took it from me, then turned around and brought it in the back. Never even apologized for it.  I sat back down and finished my taco and.left most of my beans and rice on the plate. She came back with a new bottle and put it on the table. She noticed I had pushed the plate away and asked me &#34;don&#39;t you want to use the new bottle?&#34; I said  the food was already ruined. She said &#34;oh&#34; and walked away. Never an apology let alone an offer for replacement sides or any other offer of restitution  after giving me ransid food.

This place is not worthy of going back and I suspect I am not alone in that notion. I informed them of the problem and they did nothing."

Although the place is small, they have about 6 booths and some tables in the middle.  All orders are made to order so you&#39;ll have to stand out of the way for a carryout order.  

They have the standard fast food Mexican food items, but I like their specialty burritos including a fan request.  Living out west, this restaurant is one of the few places to make carne asada fries, which they call garbage fries here.  Overall, decent value especially when you have a Groupon."

I primarily go for Taco Tuesdays.  This isn&#39;t really because I need to get tacos for 89 cents, but more because I like the alliteration.  (I often observe TV free Tuesdays, which is somewhat connected.)

NOTB is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking in the shared lot.  Walking into the place you notice it is very small, but they do manage to fit about 8 tables in the place.  You order at the counter, but they will bring the food out to your table if you are eating in.  The atmosphere is casual, fast food place.  Nothing fancy, but exactly what I would expect.

My wife and I almost always order the same thing... shredded beef tacos and chicken tacos.  At my other favorite taco joint I like to get the marinated pork, but while tasty, it is tough and oddly dry at NOTB.  Every once in a while I forget this and order. I was reminded on my most recent visit.  I have never had the steak tacos, but a reminder to all the haters out there... do you really think you are going to get filet mignon for 89 cents?  As a general rule I stay away from &#34;steak&#34; at low end places.

For the first few years that I came to NOTB, they would provide free chips and salsa if you ate in for dinner.  I thought this was very generous considering the reasonably priced food.  Unfortunately, I guess the economics of the situation caught up with them because that stopped about a year ago.  Now I just purchase it anyway.  The salsa is tasty with beans and corn in it, but it is not very spicy.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but I wanted to call it out for you spice lovers.

Once again, being a creature of habit, I always get the Jarritos to drink.  I don&#39;t often drink pop, but because it is from Mexico, it is made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.  Taste the difference!

While eating, I like to choose a few magazines from the rack that is next to the trash cans.  They have a funny collection like PC Gamer, Us, and some audio/video enthusiast magazines.

My interactions with the staff have always been pleasant.  They are helpful and efficient.

Overall, this place is good for what it is trying to be.  I am happy to have a taco joint like this in Bartlett.  I will definitely be back."

I have decided to start writing reviews on Yelp because, while I use the site frequently to read others reviews, I have found some times that the reviews are not reflective of my experience.  

My own imposed rules for any review:

1. Must visit at least three times.  Two of which must be distinctly different formats; i.e. one weekday night and one weekend night.
2. Must order something unique each visit.
3. If they have any &#34;signature&#34; items on the menu, you must order a &#34;signature&#34; item at least once.
4. Ratings are based on a 10 point scale with 5 being average, which does not mean bad.  What a score of 5 means is that the category meets expectations for that establishments format. 

Thanks.

Location/Layout - 5/10:  Located at the end of strip mall on route 59 in Bartlett the location is very accessible and easily visible.  The interior offers standard quick service comforts with plastic booths and laminated tables but they do put some effort into the décor, offering a Tex/Mex interior that is spot on for the style of the restaurant.  

Menu - 6/10: North of the Border specializes in your usual Mission style burrito fare.  Where they attempt to stand out is in their offering of several specialty burritos.  They also offer a full line of other Tex/Mex options, including nachos, tacos, tortas, and fajitas but they excel with their burrito selection.  There are daily specials that are very economical and keep patrons coming back.

Service - 6/10: the service is usually friendly and accommodating.  They are always willing to discuss every minute detail with my spouse.  They have always accommodated her requests to add and subtract ingredients based on her very basic and unadventurous palette.

Food - 7/10: There is nothing on the menu that has ever been subpar but unfortunately in all my visits there has been nothing that has been life altering.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, it truly means that they are consistent but at the same time do not venture to far off the path.  The one suggestion that I would make for improvement is in the proteins.  As noted in other reviews the proteins quality used to be suspect but they have improved the quality greatly of over the years and should be commended for doing so.  My mild criticism is that the proteins are very bland for this style of cuisine and create a situation where you are using more of the red and green sauces than is necessary, but fortunately both sauces are tasty so that is why it is not a deal breaker for me.  My standard go to burrito is the Tres Amigos, while my partner chooses her burrito by customizing the ingredients based on her mood that day.  I am also a fan of the Tortas and the Inferno Burrito.  But the best kept secret on the menu are the fries, most especially the Garbage Fries.  They are loaded and they are a perfect combination of heat and savory along with crispy to offset the beans and meats that are piled on top.  Prices are reasonable, although some are high (see the price for the Garbage Fries and you will see why we only order them occasionally) but they do offer nightly specials, Monday through Thursday, with steep discounts.    

Drinks - 5/10:  They offer the standard fountain drinks and Jarritos for those interested.

Overall Experience - 6.5/10:  This is a very solid quick service Tex/Mex restaurant in the Northwestern Burbs.  If you are searching for an establishment that offers consistent service with quality food at a reasonable price then you should give North of the Border a shot."

I had a couple of steak tacos from here and all I can say is I WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN THIS PLACE AGAIN! I have eaten here twice and both times have been beyond disappointing. The steak they use is just grizzle, fat and tough as hell. 

Just a warning, stay away from here, just gross."

First off it was more like.chewy ground beef. There is nothing steak about that steak. It was just lacking flavor. Its very simple to prepare a Mexican style shirt steak . Marinate in lemon or just add salt to flavor, cook, chop. I don&#39;t know what was done here but it wasnt that. My burrito had more lettuce than anything. I get that its Bartlett and not Chicago or a Mexican neighborhood, but to be called &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican food, is very misleading. Place seem to be run.by decent people. Just some advice NOTB  change ur meat preperation ans style and things could be good   ,stop in a few places in chicago, they may give u some ideas. ..  the hotchata though, was delicious!!Glad they had jarritos there. delicious mexican style soda. If they tell me they.chnaged it up i may return, or if i have a taste for horchata and im in the area."

At least put the pit in it so it stays green if you&#39;re going to pretend its freshly made. One star just because really, how hard is it to make a decent taco?

My mom and I both bought a Groupon to here when it was available. Monday&#39;s are 65 cent Taquitos, so we had a few of both avocado and refried bean fried and stuffed sticks, a couple of chicken tacos for my mom, and this monstrous, made-for-catering Nacho platter.  My mom ordered the ultimate nachos not expecting to get an entire tin that will last us three days if we eat it for breakfast, lunch AND dinner stuffed with all the goodies you can imagine.  Ours was the meatless version, and was it ever mouth-watering.  On top of the chips, they tossed refried beans and hot, melting white Mexican cheese.  It&#39;s topped with tomatoes, black olives, and onions.  North of the Border threw a large dollop of both sour cream and guacamole on the very top with some jalapeno slices for an extra bite.  If you are keen to spice I suggest mixing the two salsa&#39;s they provide and sprinkling this on top of everything.  If spice is not your cup of tea, the green salsa is a mild, tasty addition.  I highly recommend this little location on 59 for both catering, delivery, and a eat-in meal.  Everything I&#39;ve tried ends in a food baby belly and a smile."

I love their tacos &amp; flautas + the Jarito drinks are a great addition to the meal. I&#39;m rather picky about salsa &amp; chips but they meet the bill. I also like their sauces, especially the green sauce (not sure of the name). I&#39;ve only eaten there a few times but even the place is fairly small, it&#39;s clean with 3 booths on either side &amp; 3 tables in the middle (tho most people seem to prefer the booths - I&#39;m one of em). They stopped serving their choco-tacos which was their best dessert option in my opinion. Delivery isn&#39;t bad either, good portions for reasonable prices. As for waiter service, you place your order &amp; pay at the register &amp; they bring it out to you. Fast too."

You can order tacos American style (lettuce, tomato, cheese) or Mexican style (cilantro, onion, and a side of lime). By default, tacos are made with soft corn tortillas unless you request otherwise. The rice and beans that come with their taco dinner were small portions.

Not much to see if dining inside (just tables, chairs, and a few accent pieces on the wall). It&#39;s more of a low-end restaurant (not a lot of frills).

But the reason to go is the guacamole is remarkably fresh and well made! Their chips aren&#39;t as good, so just order guacamole and get your chips elsewhere."

The last year service has gone down hill, I&#39;ve placed three to go orders in the past month and every time something is wrong.  Either they forget something or add something I&#39;ve asked to be removed.  By the time you get home and open it it&#39;s really inconvenient to have to call them, drive back and wait for a new order.  On the last two occasions I made it specific that i did not want avacados, and yet still got them.  I called back and was told to bring it back and they&#39;d make a new one.  Did this once.  45 minutes later my family was done with theirs and I got to eat alone.  Unfortunately I won&#39;t be returning the service is awful and they don&#39;t seem to care anymore which is a shame as they used to be wonderful.  Now it&#39;s a bunch of high school girls on their cell phones while the kitchen flirts with them.  No thanks!"

When I walked in the place, every table was full with people of all ages. The food smelled DELICIOUS. It&#39;s been awhile since I ate authentic Mexican food. I ordered the (chicken) taco dinner -- YUM! Taco met my expectations. The rice wasn&#39;t really good, though. It was barely warm, not spicy, and lacked taste. It cost me about $7 for my dinner plus a soda, which isn&#39;t bad. I&#39;d probably come back here if I lived in the area, but since I don&#39;t, I doubt I&#39;ll be back."

Then I thought why do I have to go there when there&#39;s a Mexican place right across the street?   So I decided to give the place a try.

The decor is almost like Chipotle with a couple traditional hats on the wall to make it more Mexican, lol.  The restaurant is small so it probably seats around 50 people at most.  They have 2 HDTVs to display their combos but I think it&#39;s a waste for what it displays and should be more informative.  Regular wall menu is better than those bright things.

I ordered the mixed Chicken-Steak Fajita and a drink.  I would give this place an average when it comes to food taste.  It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s not anything special either.  You could get better food from On The Border, but it&#39;s WAAAY better than Taco Bell ;)

So if you live in the area and crave Taco Bell, make a B-line for this place.  If you happen to come from some distance, you should go for another, better tasting Mexican restaurant.

BTW, prices range from $ to $$ ."

The staff isn&#39;t the friendliest and they usually mess up my order in the drive thru.  We went in last night for dine in, I ordered the steak taco dinner with cheese on my tacos. The meat was good, the cheese..well  had I gotten more than 3 little pieces on each taco, I could tell you how that was. My daughter ordered the steak torta dinner which was good. They had a sign posted advertising $3 coronas so we each had 2.  The server never came around to bring us our check so when i went to the register and he rang me out our bill was $40. I had to ask for the detailed receipt and noticed our beers were rang out at $5 each. When I asked about it and pointed out the sign he laughed and said thats only when the sign is lit and turned around and walked away not wanting to hear anything else I had to say. He already had my signed credit card receipt so he obviously didn&#39;t care.  I waited for a few minutes for some one to come back up front and nothing. So we left. 

I had this issue back a few years ago too with their location in Hoffman, their beer prices on the menu were different from what they charged and when i asked the waitress she said their prices had gone up but they had not updated the pricing in the menu. I had to argue with them to charge me menu price, which they did end up doing. 

I&#39;ve noticed they don&#39;t give you the detailed pricing unless you ask for it. I&#39;ve only gotten the credit card receipt to sign and thats it and I&#39;m sure its because I&#39;m not the only person they&#39;ve done this too. They&#39;re food isn&#39;t bad although I won&#39;t be going back to be ripped off. If they&#39;re advertising one price they should be honoring it rather then over charging and ripping their customers off."

On the way to class, husband and I sought out a place to grab a quick bite. I guess impulsive eats always run the risk of fail because that&#39;s exactly how we both described our tortas that we picked via drive thru at Los Fernandez Taqueria. Hubby had a breaded chicken torta which he described as an over priced McChicken. I had the pastor torta which was totally bland. Both portions were so small too which was a disappoint. We also ordered a horchata which was way too sweet. It tasted like gum paste. Overpriced, tasteless fail. I do NOT recommend."

Then there&#39;s the service. I felt unwelcome. And like I was being a bother by my order.

I loved this place, my go to when I&#39;m craving for some goooood mexican food. Unfortunately, tonight i bought 1 lengua taco, 2 steak tacos and 1 green tamales. I was enjoying my food and saved my tamales for last.. as saving the best for last... ONLY to find out it is spoiled!!!!! The outside was very dry and when i opened the middle part, it was sticky and smelled very sour. So I called the store, spoke to Martin and told him that they gave me a spoiled Tamales. He put me on hold and when he came back he said, oh nooo its not spoiled, we just tried and ate our tamales here. Instead of apologizing, he insisted that they didn&#39;t give me a spoiled tamales. I got soooo mad at that point, once again I told him that just to make things straight I&#39;m not asking for any refund. I would like to inform them that they gave me a spoiled tamales!!! I asked for a manager and he said their manager wasn&#39;t there and I asked him what time the manager will be in tomorrow and he answered me &#34;I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t work tomorrow!&#34; Way to answer a complaining customer!!!!

They were so good that I would come in at least twice a month.  The quality and feeling completely unwelcome was starting, but was not terrible.  After my last experience, I will never return.  

I called in an order for some carbon tacos, and I happily picked them up and raced home to devour them!  When my husband and I opened up the tacos, we saw brown rotten cilantro in all tacos, and the meat was the leftover fat you toss in the garbage!  

At that moment, my husband and I decided that in the future we will go back to our previous favorite, El Rodeo.  Never again can I visit an establishment that would serve paying customers rotten herbs, and fat scraps.  I did not take them back to the store, I just tossed them in the garbage.  They were not even fit for my dogs to eat.  

No, I did not get snippy with the folks at the restaurant as I know better than to be mean to the folks preparing your food.  This was just really awful food."

Service was extremely slow. Waitress was rude when we pointed out that she dropped off another table&#39;s order. She wanted us to eat their food because we ordered chicken and they ordered steak which was saving us money. We didn&#39;t want to eat steak. We asked for a manager who never came over. We got the check and found we were over charged. Again no manager to correct the problem so I left the money that was per their menu pricing not what they decided to charge to rip us off. This was our dine in experience. Figured we would give it a try in the drive thru a few weeks later since it was mostly table service that was ridiculous. That was a mistake...again tried to overcharge us despite what their menu prices said. Food was wrong. Had to wait for over 20 minutes to get it right. Not worth the hassle with other great mexican restaurants in the neighborhood.

Full bar, cocktails menu, small karaoke stage, 3 types of salsa that come with the free chips, good food, nice waitresses, Univision on the TVs, and good prices!  All of these crammed into a rather small but comfortable restaurant.  I read that they have a drive-thru window too??

I really appreciate that they know how to wrap a burrito well.  There was meat all the way down to the final bite.  And the steak from the tampiquena dinner had such a good, char flavor!  1 guacamole, 1 burrito, and 1 dinner entree was like $20.

I docked 1 star for the cheesy lights, not appealing diner looking furniture, and the Halloween decorations (that cackling witch above the front door really scared me).  Sorry!"

I LOVE Mexican food! I lived for a period of time in Mexico City with a Mexican family and now salsa runs through my veins! When I had my first tacos at Los Fernandez, I actually sought out the owner &amp; told her how THRILLED I was with her restaurant&#39;s food. I told her how authentic the food tasted and it was served hot with plenty of onions and cilantro. I would be back again! The prices were pretty good too. Well folks, things are NOT as they used to be at Los Fernandez Taqueria. Food quality and service at the DRIVE THOUGH has gone to hell! I can&#39;t speak about what they serve indoors since I haven&#39;t been inside for quite some time. I started ordering my tacos at the drive-thru &amp; noticed that there were NO PRICES on the menu board. I guess this is so they keep raising their prices without getting a new menu board. They also had a NEW sign out front. It appeared that they must be doing quite well since lots of money was being spent on their image. I asked him for a menu to see all the prices. Nice looking menu. So, now we have a nice menu, beautiful menu board complete with no prices and a fantastic sign to lure in more customers. 

I asked my friend at the window &#34;What exactly is a Taco Alambre?&#34; Well, apparently he had no idea because he had to close the window and proceed to have a full on 5 minute conversation with another guy standing next to him. They were talking back and forth and doing all sorts of sign language. I could only imagine what they were saying. It was kind of like a &#34;Who&#39;s on First, What&#39;s on Second&#34;. Hand signals were flying back &amp; forth between the 2 of them. I thought to myself, &#34;I&#39;m not asking you how to land an airplane after the pilot has died at the steering wheel. I just want to know what is Alambre.&#34; He came back told me it was beef with cilantro &amp; onions. Well, that describes half of their menu. I decided that I would just try one. I did notice on the menu that taco prices had gone up AGAIN since I was last there. Most of their tacos were now $1.99 &amp; that&#39;s just a politically correct way of saying $2.00. I proceeded to order the following tacos: Alambre, Barbacoa. Al Pastor &amp; Loma.I then shut off my car&#39;s engine. Getting your drive through order at Los Fernandez is a gas guzzling operation. Always remember to have a full tank of gas when you order at the drive thru. Bring something to read and some snacks to tie you over while you wait for your tacos . Bring something to drink so you don&#39;t faint. You need to keep yourself fully hydrated.

I sat in that drive-thru line for 25 minutes. No one ever came to the window to let me know what was going on. Customers behind me were zipping out of line &amp; leaving the parking lot. When my friend finally came to the window, he apologized for the long wait. I asked him why it was so long. He told me that the cook messed up. He offered me a small drink for my inconvenience. I wish he would have offered it earlier as I was getting parched in my car and my blood sugar levels were rapidly dropping.

Long story, short... I got home and my tacos were cold. There was barely any onions and cilantro on all of them. The Alambre taco had bacon with huge chunks of barely cooked fat. I ended up spitting out most of the bacon. The other tacos were just the run of the mill food I was trying to avoid. Remember what Joe Pesci said in Lethal Weapon 2, &#34;They F*** you at the drive thru!&#34;"

The food was very good.  Based on other Yelp reviews we tried the steak burrito &amp; the al pastor (pork) tacos.  I loved the tiny diced &amp; grilled pineapple in with the al pastor tacos, a nice touch!  They now give you 3 salsas on the table with your chips &amp; since they don&#39;t bother to explain them unless you ask let me tell you:  only the really red one is mild.  The green, which I&#39;ve often found to be mild elsewhere was actually the hottest of the three here!  The other is more of a medium heat in my opinion.  Their house made tortilla chips are a bit thicker than what you might be used to...I liked them but hubby prefers the thin kind.  I also tried their Sangria which is red wine, fruit &amp; tequila - delicious and strong!

The restaurant was clean, appears to have a full bar, and everyone there was very nice.  The food also came out quite fast."

The tacos and other menu items are all reasonably priced, just watch out for all the grease you&#39;re about to intake. Thankfully I don&#39;t eat here too often.

Only one gripe, if you order from the drive-thru, they don&#39;t through in the chips or dip. Eat in if you wish to attain this freebie. The bonus is that they are open late so if there&#39;s nothing else left in Streamwood or Hanover Park after dark, there&#39;s always this little Taqueria."

I was delighted to see #2 open up just a few minutes away! 

So, I finally went here today...  At first, I was disappointed in the menu selection they have currently. I asked them why it was so cut down compared to the other location, and clearly tailored to Americans? (Only 4 kinds of meat (steak, chicken, pastor and ground beef if I recall), tacos, burritos, 4 regular tortas, chimichanga, etc etc.)  I asked about the customer-base, and other questions. 

What I found out was that they started out with the &#34;american basics&#34; or most popular items to build up a customer base, and plan on adding more items the menu as they grow. Customers are overwhelmingly American at this time, and it made sense, but I said that it&#39;s a shame they do this because what they offer isn&#39;t really the best of what they have to offer - to me, it&#39;s really tailored Americanized Mexican - and they are alienating the potential Mexican/.Latin customer. I also found out that location #1 will not be the same if I go back because they hired new cooks to take over for the long-time cook who moved to location #2 (which is great news for #2, not so for #1.)

So, after a bit of chatting, I managed to order a cubana torta (not on the menu) and an horchata. The horchata was quite tasty, with a nice blend of flavors and it had a french vanilla ice cream-like taste to it. Hard to detail, but quite good...maybe one of the better ones in the area actually. 

(Unfortunately, the cubana torta didn&#39;t yet make it to the printed menu. They said they tried to put it on their blackboard special, but only sold about 4 during the week. Another interesting note is they said that most customer will order tacos with lettuce and tomatoes and stuff. I said ewwww, and looked at him puzzled. So, to help their customers try it the way it really should be, they have a current taco special with cilantro and onion.)

Back to the food, and the torta was great. If you read my lengthy review of location #1 then you will understand that I&#39;m not a fan of the &#34;normal&#34; torta with beans and lettuce and all that stuff in it. 

Especially if you come to a place that names itself after a food item...I&#39;m a firm believer that you better give that thing a try! 

So, my cubana had perfectly toasted bread which held together the wonderful mess inside. The filling consisted of milenesa, homemade(!) chorizo, slice of ham, tomato, maybe a slice of avocado, onion slices and cheese. (no sausage or hot dog, but it was probably better. I was so hungry I forgot to look at it before I started eating. I even forgot to add some salsa!) 

Regardless, it was very tasty and definitely hit the spot - maybe more so than it used to be. The chorizo hit it out of the park for sure!"

Very friendly and helpful service as we entered the restaurant. The woman at the counter suggested a build your own burrito or the Mexican tacos special. We went with the tacos (steak). The chips and salsa were fine, chips were nice and warm and the salsa was spicy but a little one-dimensional. Next the tacos...delicious! The meat was nicely cooked and the corn taco shells were tasty with a great texture. The topping were fresh and flavorful and the house salsa went perfectly on the tacos (better than alone with the chips). The rice and beans were great, too! 
We will be back to this little taco shop... Maybe to try the tortas next?!"

Its bad enough they felt uncomfortable because they dont speak Spanish but to hear my daughters bf complain they were really rude than I&#39;m positive the rudeness wasn&#39;t imagined. 2nd they got me 3 tacos carne asado  con cebolla y cilantro Nada mas. Once sauce made it in the bag, I&#39;m used to 2 sauce :-) but no problem. Here comes the problem..... The meat was salty, I was chewing so much fat(rubber) that I had to keep spitting out the food. From 3 tacos it basicly was 1 1/2 I ate. Im not sure if this is a common occurrence there but I Dont have that at other Taquierias. I honestly wished it was good since it was so close to home but guess I&#39;ll still to the Irving park ones."

I&#39;ve had trouble finding one that I really liked since I moved here. I&#39;ve been here twice so far for taco&#39;s and they were great both times. I&#39;ve tried all 4 of the meats (chicken, pork, steak, and ground beef) on the taco&#39;s and liked all of them. The steak is probably my least favorite due to having some chunks of fat in it, but that goes with the territory. As for the service itself, they need to smile more and be happy about their business. I was not treated rudely and didn&#39;t have any problems. I just didn&#39;t feel like they were happy/excited about their newly opened business. Smile people! I&#39;ll be happy to keep coming back as long as the food stays good though. ;)

Oh, and take note, this place is in the far back corner of this shopping center. I&#39;m always on the lookout for new Mexican places and didn&#39;t even notice this place for a month.

===========

Update: So, they are getting better. They smile more, they have two sauces now (at least they did last week), and, for a short time, they had Coke in a glass bottle (continue that and add Pepsi in a glass bottle i&#39;ll be extra happy)."

Italian herb and cheese bread, veggie, american cheese, everything except for pickles, olives, and banana peppers.  Why do people still mess this up?  There is one short girl that is very rude, I don&#39;t know what her issue is half the time but she shows a lot of attitude whenever she makes my sandwiches.  And sadly it looks like she bullies some of the new staff members too.

As far as the sandwich, it tastes like a regular sub.  The restaurant is usually clean, line moves fairly fast during the lunch and dinner hours, and they are stocked with all the sides.  Being a mall employee who is also vegetarian, I don&#39;t have a lot of options for lunch so I still come here.  Maybe i&#39;ll start buying my sandwiches from another location before I come to work to avoid coming here so often."

Kind of pricey, but it goes with the territory of &#34;trendy&#34; restaurants. This place is like the Chipotle of Mediterranean food, as the menu and setup is very similar: you have a choice of your meat, type of plate, and you go in an assembly line of ingredients.

I always go with the steak schwarma salad bowl. It actually has LESS fat than their chicken. Naf Naf has a cool nutritional calculator on their website, so you know what you&#39;re getting, you IIFYM freak! The steak is shredded to pieces, which helps with the tenderness of the meat. The bread, my son absolutely loves, so I give him my pita bread each time.

Overall, nutritious food, at a slightly-higher price for my cheap ass. For the steak schwarma with no addons, it comes out to be around 9-smack-a-roos."

The baba ghanoush is very smokey and bitter.

The pitas are soft and chewy but go south as soon as they cool. Kinda flimsy, too.

The portions seem small for the price. So do the falafel- which are tasty.

If not for a dousing of garlic sauce and tahini it would have been an extremely disappointing meal, for me.

My kids, 5 and 8 year old boys, liked it but not as much as other Mediterranean Inns we frequent.

The steak and humus were pretty tasty and the rice wasn&#39;t bad.

The hot sauces were nice to look at and a little interesting but soon just blended into the monotonous flavor palate.

The dill pickle pucks do not taste appropriate for the dishes- think McDonalds pickles.

Over-priced, underwhelming, so-so. I&#39;d come here again if I didn&#39;t have time to go a few miles up the road and was literally starving half into death and Costco was out of free samples.

The service was polite and helpful. The place seems clean."

A place that limits its focus to shwarma and hummus.  Fresh pita in house.  A simple menu.  Fresh quality ingredients.  And camels in the decor.  Awesome!&#34;  I liked it so well, that I brought hubby over the very next day.  Both times I enjoyed a bowl of hummus with shwarma on top.  You can have rice or lettuce in the bottom of your bowl as well.  Of course, there&#39;s the option of a pita sandwich.  I was thrilled that their allergen menu clearly stated that almost all of their food (exceptions are the obvious pita and baklava) were gluten free.  The portions are large for me, both times I couldn&#39;t finish my whole bowl.  But that&#39;s probably because I got the fries, which I found very tasty, and some falafel as well.  I liked the falafel.  But that&#39;s a very personal taste.  You will have to try them and see.  I had fine experiences with service on both visits.  The employees seemed cheerful and happy at work.  On my solo visit, the staffer cleaning the store offered to clear my obviously all done bowl.  I let him.  The decor is white walls with some tile (too many kinds for me-four is too much, pick two or three, please!), and the tables bolted to the concrete floor.  The bathroom was large and clean.  The only reason that I am not giving them four or even five stars is because on the second visit the food seemed to upset me and my husband both.  Sigh.  Nothing that serious.  But still..."

It was nearly 9 bucks for a simple item like the hummus with steak shawarma bowl (which wasn&#39;t a huge portion) before either tacking on another $2.10 for a drink or $2.99 to turn it into a combo with a side. For a little over 13 bucks after tax, I could&#39;ve gotten both a lunch special from Pita Inn and one from Firewood Kabob, both of which are larger individually than 1 entree here.

Ignoring the high prices, the food itself wasn&#39;t that special. The chicken and the steak were both cut so thin and tasteless that I wasn&#39;t really sure which one I was eating at times. The amount of meat provided was so little I wasn&#39;t entirely sure when I was eating meat or vegetables. The fries were mostly soft, not really even crispy at all -- most of the other local Mediterranean restaurants (especially firewood kabob) give the perfect mix of herbs, crispiness, and softness.The rice itself seemed quite oily without any real aroma or flavor. The falafel was okay, but its small size didn&#39;t provide much of anything to chew on. For 7.79, the hummus and falafel bowl is a poor deal compared to a dozen falafel (you get 6 here) you get for 5.99 at Pita Inn which is both larger and tastier.

The only redeeming quality is that the pitas are actually fluffy and flavorful, but this reason is not enough to justify another visit."

My wife enjoyed the Steak Shawarma with Lentil Rice giving both thumbs up.  We had the combo meals which also added a drink and for the two of us, it came to $22 with tax.  If you just wanted the food by itself, you&#39;re looking at $14-$15 so it&#39;s very comparable to a Chipotle or Piada.  The portions were filling but not over the top to make you heavy.

Fine, I got the bowl then and pita on the side. Then I waited on the next worker who was cashier to help me with my toppings and then decided she was done helping and had me wait by the register (my food getting cold) instead of ringing me up. For an insanely long and awkward time. She just left. Without a word. It was not crowded. She could&#39;ve easily done it, just didn&#39;t feel like it. I try to understand since I&#39;ve worked in a similar food store before but this was just unreasonable and sloppy. When I finally asked if I could pay no one apologized, just got an eyeroll as both workers pretended to not hear me. It was not crowded, there were maybe 5 people inside Naf Naf. When she finally made the excruciating trek to the register she rung up the wrong items. Again, had to point that out to her. No &#39;sorry&#39; once again. 

I don&#39;t understand how these disinterested people have jobs. With so many good folks out there looking for work and giving a shit, I really don&#39;t get how this pair of workers ended up here.

Overpriced, under portioned. 
No lunch specials. 
Decor like Chipotle but with glass lamp shades. 
Could have been cleaner.
1st time there menu is a list of item names with no description of what&#39;s included.
Counter girl had no idea other employee stood there and could care less, I got the impression they thought it was funny. 
When asked what the combo included (as the wording was ambiguous) she had no idea said you get only one choice for $2.99: Potato chips, soft drink, rice or soup ($2.99 for a soft drink not to mention the rest) did not order the combo for $2.99
Food was fair, until hour later both of us (who ate there) got stomach aches.

Falafel could be a bit more generously sized but delicious none the less.  Naff fries are thick cut potato chip style which where a nice change of presentation.

One with cilantro which I love. There&#39;s also a cabbage salad that&#39;s pretty simple tasting but adds a great crunch. They have fried potatoes with a combo meal. Too crunchy n greasy for my taste so I go with the lentil soup. It is very good. It&#39;s yellow lentil soup n tastes exactly how my mom makes hers from scratch so that&#39;s a winner.

I told them I have a gluten allergy and can&#39;t have bread so a &#34;bowel&#34; was suggested by staff.

I went back and I was told &#34;the bowls don&#39;t come with rice or lettuce. It costs more.&#34; Essentially since I asked for no bread, I got charged $2 more than a pita, but got just the contents of the pita.

This location has been open for about two weeks now and our office was looking forward to a nice change of pace with somewhere super close to lunch on shawarma and falafel instead of the usual burger fare.

The setup, if you&#39;ve never been, is basically like a Chipotle, where you order piecemeal and then they make things right in front of you.  Right up front is the first problem though, compared to the menu available online, there&#39;s only about 1/3 of the actual items available.  Maybe that&#39;s just growing pains but it does make it a somewhat limited selection.

The other problem right off the bat is this place is kind of expensive.  A basic meal is around $8-10 and that&#39;s not even including them trying to upsell (3 times before hitting the register, come on!) some rather sad potato chips and a drink for an extra $3.  When you compare this to almost any other lunch place around here, that&#39;s quite pricey especially when (at least when we went) the server was pretty stingy with the portion size.

When it comes down to the food, it&#39;s ok.  It&#39;s not great middle eastern food, it&#39;s not terrible food.  It&#39;s about average, which if you put prices aside, that wouldn&#39;t be all that bad for a quick lunch place.

But when you factor in that an extra 10 minute drive will take you to Pita Inn where you get twice as much food, the food is unquestionably better, and you pay half as much, I just really can&#39;t see a reason to go to Naf Naf."

I got take out from this location.
From what I saw, this is like a chipotle for Mediterranean food. I went with the vegetarian option, the falafel rice bowl. When I got there everything had just run out so they needed to make more so I had to wait a little while. Basically it&#39;s a bowl with rice, that they threw falafel on, I got both of the salads( classic? and purple cabbage) which were quite good, and then all three of the sauces as well as onions and pickles. 
I got a combo so I also got fries and a drink. The total was ~ $12 which for a meal with no meat was pretty expensive. 
The food: Fries: were very good, thin circular and topped with a batter, very crispy and good. The problem,  like I said they were running low on stuff so I got a half filled container.
Bowl: really good, the falafel was crunchy and well seasoned.( not the best I&#39;ve had but very good. ) The rice was also good, i think it was a basmati, and all the toppings made it very tasty. I got the hot sauce and it was delicious, not too spicy and added just the right amount of spice.I don&#39;t know if my meal was suppose to include hummus because no one asked me if I wanted any, but anyone that got a pita got hummus in their bread so I assume I should have gotten some.
 I also got bread on the side that was spongy and they don&#39;t warm it up but it was good too. 
Overall, this is a really good place, especially out in these parts. I think the next time I&#39;d ask for the hummus in the bowl.  I hope this sparse material availability is not a regular thing at this restaurant. They seemed pretty busy so I think that speaks for itself. They seem to use a lot of garlic but I think it&#39;s not over the top. i hope to try this again soon."

I tried it for the first  time and there&#39;s really nothing to like about it. I understand it&#39;s a chain and I shouldn&#39;t expect much but naf naf is an overpriced place with terrible employees small portions and average taste.

First off, the little pita you get cost 9 dollars. My cousin got that with fries and a drink and it came out to almost $15. And don&#39;t forget we were both still pretty hungry after eating there.

Since it was my first time I had never seen what you can put in the pita but the girl making it for me expected me to know everything already. She slapped humus on it before even asking and I rushed into ordering the chicken shwarma with some onion stuff and some kind of relish on top. The girl was rude throughout the process which did not help their cause.

So when I got home to eat I had to eat through a layer of relish stuff then eat through an entire layer of onion and then I was left with the last half of the pita filled with extremely dry chicken. Needless to say it was a horrible experience and it may have tasted great if they could somehow mix up the ingredients in the pita.

The only cool thing here is the machine they have to slice the meat automatically but that&#39;s not saying much and maybe they have high prices to pay for those things."

It&#39;s like Chipotle but with Middle Eastern food.

I love this restaurant. I get falafel pita with everything except the garlic sauce (which is not vegan). I have emailed corporate about offering a vegan garlic sauce and let&#39;s hope they go for it.

They make their own pita bread so it is even better than Pita Inn&#39;s bread. Speaking of Pita Inn, do I love that place too? Yes. AND, I also love Pita Pita. Those are my three go-to place in the NW suburbs.

For whatever reason Pita Inn never wanted to expand nationally.

To me the value is definitely a stretch, as two sandwiches and one drink was well over $20.  I might have given the place 4 stars but not at these prices.

This place looks identical to Chipotle on the inside (and every other restaurant that has copied it).

I know it&#39;s a little controversial to say this around here, but I think their food quality is better than Pita Inn.
Given that, I am also disappointed by this location. They are so stingy with the hummus, in both the pitas and hummus bowl! I seem to remember being able to taste hummus on your plate at the other locations. I also wish they had kafta at this location too.
I&#39;ll keep coming to this Naf Naf because it&#39;s the closest location, but I&#39;ll cry a little on the inside."

I am so disappointed at this place.. I consider my self as a fan for Mediterranean food and after been through so many nice places and experiences , Naf Naf was high on expectations and big let down on experience...

Their Menu is nothing new and is almost same as what you get at Roti or Pita Inn or IDOF (I Dream of Falafel) but the only difference is NNG (Naf Naf Grill @ Mt Prospect) appeared to be still trying to figure out what they are doing

Food quality was ok, nothing to get excited about.. Pita was way too thick... I don&#39;t like that thick flab of Carbohydrate..Schawarma was thin and tad too oily

Rice portion side was $3 for a cup !! Feels over priced...  Same with lentil soup..  I don&#39;t mind paying $3 for a side, but give me atleast enough quantity..

I ordered Hummus plate with Schawarma, after applying the layer of Humas and putting some chicken on it, the guy kept on asking, what you want on top ... I wanted to tell him.. you hardly have 4 options out there ... of which 1 is pickle, 1 was onion and 1 was something like coleslaw... you really want me to tell you what to put....
Moreover I didn&#39;t know , what is included in the stated $8.49 and what is extra.. I had an inkling that the serving guy didn&#39;t had a clue either..

Finally at the billing counter that lady charged me incorrectly for two meals and side of rice when I only had one cup of rice and one soup in my tray... Its my bad that I didn&#39;t notice this before leaving restaurant.  They use machine to scrap schawarma, probably should use machine to mind the billing counter too....

If Owner is reading it, please visit &#39;I dream of Falafel&#39; and see how its done ... I discovered that place a month back and have already visited it thrice now.... Naf Naf grill I like the name, it sticks to tongue but experience doesn&#39;t demand a revisit and btw you guys owe me the extra $s you charged me for the side.

With a want to end the note with positive feeling....I will mention baba ganoush.. the smoky taste of egg plant was great.. I tasted a little from wifey&#39;s plate , she ordered a vege plate.. 

Summary: An average but over priced Mediterranean fast food kind of place.. You can stop by if its close by but nothing exciting to become repeat customers unless it changes drastically for good."

They have to! Pita Inn is the gold standard of Mediterranean food around these parts and it is just a couple minutes down the road.

We were walking into Pei Wei when we changed our mind at the last minute to try this place. The store is laid out just like a chipotle. The menu is basic and you choose your options as you walk down the line to the checkout.
Pick a meat. Bowl, hummus or sandwich. Then toppings.

The food was very tasty but the falafel were a bit small. A little change of pace from pita. The pita were the puffiest I have ever seen. Little pillows!

The cost is the problem. It&#39;s a tad expensive and they can&#39;t compare to Pita Inn&#39;s prices. That&#39;s not to say the food isn&#39;t worth the price because it is! I enjoyed it and will come back."

The food was mediocre. The people working there seemed really stingy with the ingredients. They need to be more like chipotle when it comes to sides. It is a good lunch place if you have never had middle eastern food. The sauces were good. Pricey for lunch making chipotle a better value and tastier. The portions were small for a bowl."

I had their steak shawarma sandwich and shared an order of their fries(basically thick chips).  I give good marks for the quality and taste of the sandwich/pita - the meat was tender and tasty, and the fixings with it were also good.  Skip the fries.  They weren&#39;t bad, but they&#39;re just filler.  Especially if you are getting them to go, the fries aren&#39;t going to be worth eating at all unless they are still fresh and hot.  The big issue here is definitely the price.  The place is basically a Mediterranean clone of Chipotle.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they are a part of the same basic company.  No big knock against them, but what I&#39;m trying to get at is they are just simply over-priced for what they are selling.  If you&#39;re in this general area, there&#39;s a much better Mediterranean fast food chain where you can get much more good food for your buck.  The fries themselves were over 2.50 - for what amounts to a the typically large size that you get at most fast food chains.  WAY OVER PRICED for just basic fried slices of potatoes.  The sandwich was just shy of 8 bucks.  It was good, just not 8 bucks good, especially with the other options in the area.  If I were in an area where this was the only Shawarma/hummus....sure I would come back, but sorry Naf Naf, I won&#39;t be.  I&#39;m giving their due based on the quality of the sandwich and the friendly service - I don&#39;t want to necessarily be a detractor - I want to be fair.  However, over 18 bucks for two sandwiches and an order of fries?  Better be pretty amazing..."

Good for my cold! Noodles yum! Soup was good.
But I didn&#39;t get the buns they gave, I mean I get to lessen the heat for those who it&#39;s too hot but I wasn&#39;t feeling them and I felt bad for wasting them I tossed them in the trash I wish the menu was more descriptive cuz I would of told them none please.

 I love finding places with huge samosas and the sauces YUM YUM YUM! I purposely saved the other one for later to savor it again.

He explained what was on the tray and how to eat it ( for example eat the rice with the soup and dip the bread in the bean dish or whatever I want.) I appreciated that information. I dug in, and wow it was delicious!! Just the right spices, food was so tasty. It tasted homemade to me. Then he brought me a sample of some ball thing to try I liked it!! Thanks dude! The samosas were so amazing!! I can&#39;t rave enough about how good the food was. Ok now on to the best part. I finally went up to the register to pay and for my giant dinner special, samosas, and my drink it was $7 and some change!!! I could not believe the price!

When we were leaving, we were tempted by the wide array of desserts in their cooler. All the unique colors and shapes were intriguing, but we did not want to just pick one. Again, the proprietor offered to mix them up and picked one each of his favorite ten items and packed it in a to-go container.

There are a bunch of chairs to sit in while you wait for your order.  I waited for almost 15 minutes, though it seems much of the food was made ahead of time and was just being warmed.

It&#39;s an Indian snack shop, which sells fresh sweets, loads of snacks, and various Indian sundries (spices, ice cream, frozen food, rice, flours, etc.) It also sells freshly made vegetarian and vegan food. There&#39;s a menu full of standard favorites, such as samosas, paratha, pakora, and puris. Also tea (delicious milk tea), lassi (both plain and mango), and coffee. 

I had the lunch special. Apparently, it changes every day. Today was Monday, and if it&#39;s the same every Monday, anyone who doesn&#39;t do very spicy food would like today&#39;s special. For a mere $6 (as of this writing), you get soup, rice, a hot vegetable dish, a hot bean dish, two kinds of bread (naan and puri), and a little cold salad. As you can see from the photo, it&#39;s a LOT of food. I was hungry when I went, but I still had to take half my food home with me. That&#39;s probably why this place also offers a mini lunch special, which includes all of the stuff I listed minus the soup and rice -- for $3. You read that correctly. I&#39;ll probably get that and a cup of tea next time I go, so I might be able to finish it. Really good food. I&#39;ll also have to try it on a day when spicier foods are offered; I grew up eating both Thai and Indian food, so I&#39;m pretty spice-tolerant. 

The family who runs this place are really nice, and the gentleman behind the counter is very happy to guide you if you need help with any menu items. Not only that, if you eat in, he gives you samples of other stuff to try. Or at least, he did while I was there. In addition to my lunch special, I got to try a delightful methi pakora (little fried puffball made with spinach and besan [chickpea] flour). After I paid and told him how good it was, the cook sent out a little piece of methi paratha (spinach, millet, and corn flatbread) that she&#39;d just made. 

There is nothing better than fresh food made by people who obviously love making and serving their food. Love it. Will definitely nom again, and will take friends. :9"

If you are asked if it is too hot, this is a test.  In my case, I ended up with a spiced chile pakora that was hot hot hot.  The spinach ball pakora things are also excellent and have nicely spiced batter.

Dessert is excellent here too.  I got the Boondi, which is vegan and pretty much just fried chickpea flour and sugar.  My preschooler ate almost all of it.

The owner, D.K., is a really friendly guy and knowledgeable about what is and isn&#39;t vegan on his menu (most of the foods are vegan, whereas most of the desserts are not).

I got a vada pav ($3) which is a potato dumpling placed between a bread roll. This is typical Indian street food in Bombay and I think Vegetarian Fast Food did a good job with it. The dumpling (vada) could have been crispier, but it was nicely flavored.

I also got some dishes for take-out: alu baigan (potato-eggplant) and a cabbage-potato dish. Both of these cost about $3 for a medium-sized portion.

The cabbage-potato dish was excellent: fresh, simple and well-spiced. This is typical Indian home-cooking at its finest.

The potato-eggplant dish wasn&#39;t as good. For one thing, the eggplant didn&#39;t absorb the curry&#39;s flavors enough. Also, the eggplant was kept intact in pieces, rather than being broken apart into a mushier texture; in the case of this dish, a mushier texture would have aided flavor uptake and would have created good contrast with the firmness of the potato pieces. Lastly, I didn&#39;t like the spices on this dish. I think there was too much tomato in the mix and not enough garlic and onions.

There were two vegan desserts when I came: one type of &#34;ladoo&#34; (a fried sugar ball made of flour and spices) and also some other greyish bar-thing. I wasn&#39;t impressed with either, but it&#39;s rare that you find vegan desserts in Indian cuisine, so I&#39;m glad that they&#39;re available, nevertheless.

One final thought: that area of Glendale Heights/Bloomingdale has very few cool cafes and coffee shops. Vegetarian Fast Food could really capitalize on this if it spruced up its interior and offered some nice drinks, such as home-made Indian chai, made with soy, rice or almond milk. If it had more vegan desserts, too, it would be a great hang-out spot.

As it stands, it has a few good vegan dishes at really low prices. If you&#39;re in the area, it&#39;s worth a stop."

I decided to give them a second try because the food was actually really good enough that I was craving them, but first..let me start from the beginning. 
The parking lot is average size, but this place is easily overlook.  When you actually find the place you aren&#39;t sure if you are walking in the right door, via vegetarian fast food or the next door Chinese restaurant.  When you first walk in, you aren&#39;t even sure if this is a restaurant or a run down grocery store.  Ironically its both. The smell was overwhelming, it felt like I was walking inside a unclean bathroom, but I continue onward.  When I got up to the counter, the lady took care of me, but wasn&#39;t as helpful as the guy a few years back.  I got my food and went home to try it out.  The food was good, and there wasn&#39;t any hair in the tortillas this time, but the samosa were cold in the middle."

If we are primarily  rating on how cheap the food is then I would have given it five stars. It had the cheapest Indian food I have had in North America. However, the quality of the food here is proportional to its price,The ingrediants did not taste very fresh. I think they may use frozen food for most part, but you can&#39;t blame them since they call themselves &#34;fast food&#34;.  What I did not like was the daal(curry) being lumpy, dosa slightly burnt on top and coconut chutney that looked like it had seen better days.

This place looks like a cross between a restaurant and grocery store. It appears that they are not sure which one it will be.

Although I like the concept and had good hopes about this place, it did not do it for me."

I recently moved back to the suburbs, and as difficult as that can be, a restaurant like this makes it all the more tolerable.

I first saw Vegetarian Fast Food about a year ago and decided to give it a whirl.  Turns out I walked into a smorgasbord of Indian foods.  The owner was extremely attentive and helped to explain the many options available on the menu.  I ended up with a meal that consistented of 4 or 5 different tasty dishes (Indian food often comes in smaller portions with more variety of foods).

I returned 3 times in the first two weeks following my initial visit.  Also, I mentioned that I had just been married on one trip, and left loaded up with a to-go box full of desserts - free of charge.  The owner told me it was a congratulatory present and that I had to share it with my wife.  Now that&#39;s classy.

Bottom line: I would give it 4.5 stars.  Great food, incredibly reasonably priced, and not a lot of restaurant hassle.  If you like your vegetarian food, and you enjoy Indian cuisine, get over there ASAP."

So I only realized that it was Indian food when I decided to finally go in and check it out. I think they should add that onto the signage, but then again it kind of adds to the mystique of the place.

The owner DK is awesome. He is excited that you&#39;ve found his place and that you like Indian food. He goes out of his way to give you free samples and explain what items they have and is flexible with the lunch special items. It&#39;s no Gaylords but you&#39;ll come away from this place with an ok selection of Indian snack type and more traditional type foods. They have samosas, yellow dal soup, rotis, chickpea/ beans and some unknown vegetable mash-ups. He will give you a variety to try, he&#39;s trying to find out what appeals to his customers most. The masala tea is pretty awesome too. They have seating inside and a small grocery snack area as well as a bakery sweet case. I do have to say the &#34;fast&#34; compared to other fast food is lacking, but then again it is Indian food. And for that I say, Indian food so fast you&#39;ll freak."

However, the food is just awful. It was possibly the worst Indian food I have ever had. I will agree with others that you get large portions, but at the end of the day when you throw 3/4 of it in the trash because it tastes terrible, you&#39;re really not getting a good value. The chole tasted like canned beans mixed with canned tomato soup. The soup that came with the lunch special was bland and cold. The mango lassi was tiny, overpriced, and not that tasty. The one things we did like was the sambar, but the vada that came with it was extremely dry and flavorless. I would also like to say that vegetarian food can be healthy, but a lot of items here are deep-fried. Potatoes can also be healthy but if you deep-fry them into french fries it sort of defeats the health factor. Just because something is vegetable based does not make it healthy. They did have decent service although they didn&#39;t seem to have the setup needed for a good takeout place, or sit-down for that matter. The little shop attached to it with all kinds of Indian staples seemed promising, but we will definitely not be back for the food."

So I stopped in because i wanted something fast and something without meat.  To my surprise, it&#39;s actually a small Indian grocery store!?! Oh even better, because I live off of late night Indian (getting out of work and  staying near Devon leave u little choices)

I must have looked confused because the two men behind the counter were very sweet and patient with me. I told them my meat and rice restriction, and that I&#39;m allergic to nuts.  He picked something out for me and I waited for it to come out (it&#39;s only a couple tables and awkward for dine in, so I took mine to go). The owner was so sweet, he even gave me some Spinach Balls on the house... Picture a spicy cornmeal-like batter with spinach mixed in. Delicious. 
I don&#39;t even know what this dish I just ate is called, but it&#39;s filling and flavorful. So I opened the lid and there was cilantro and tomatoes mixed into a yellowish sauce, and chickpeas. The cilantro and lime remind me of Mexican food. But this is awesome, I never quite liked Chick Peas until today. The bread that comes with is like a mixture between naan and paratha... It&#39;s a little greasy compared to any naan I&#39;m used to. But not as tin as the large flat parathas. I will definitely be back for a quick Indian fix in the suburbs."

The freshness and quality of food along with their portion size were quite impressive. Their spices are quite mild but you can request them to make spicier. The service was friendly as well.

I ordered a few dishes and appetizers and they came out in a timely manner. They are reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  I got among other things the man chow soup which is kinda like a sweet and sour but spicy and different, as well as the some kind of chicken sticks, these were my absolute favorite item. They are fried pieces of chicken with dipping sauces and I&#39;m not sure why but they were really delicious.
For the main entree I got the Mongolian beef which comes with a lot of filler but it&#39;s ok, it&#39;s not the best but it is certainly not horrible. It is served with white rice and I think you are able to ask for more rice if you need it.  
There is something called ginger fried rice and it was gross I didn&#39;t like it at all. It had a weird indian taste but also a chinese taste and it was just all kinds of off.  it&#39;s all red too, just overall a disappointment and I would not get it again.
I wish I knew what was good here, because I feel like the place probably has some good dishes, there was a robust noodle section and a seafood section I did not get anything from there but maybe that would be better.

The vegetable manchurian was definitely tasty - on par or even slightly better than other places; good density with sauce not overpowering.

We started eating at the original location years ago, it used to be in Hoffman Estates. Their &#34;new&#34; location is in Carol Stream (they&#39;ve been here for a number of years now)

The cuisine is Haka Chinese. The Haka Chinese settled in India a few generations ago, amd they incorporated Indian spices/techniques with their Chinese food. And the result is AMAZING. We went for my parents&#39; anniversary, and there were 16 of us. So we ordered a virtual buffet of all of our favs.

Must have&#39;s include: chicken hot garlic wontons, house special wings, chicken and shrimp pakoras, manchow soup, chicken corn soup, haka noodles, chili chicken (dry and gravy), Manchurian chicken (dry and gravy), beef with okra, chicken basil, chili potatoes. 

And you MUST try, what I lovingly refer to as, their &#34;magic&#34; sauce. It makes everything even more delicious!!

My only gripe is that they tame the flavor for the American palate.  Even though some items indicate that they fall under the &#34;spicy&#34; category, they are rather far removed.  This one time, out of my several satisfied visits, the chicken item I ordered tasted sweet rather than spicy.

Instinctively we ordered our favorites from the old Hot Wok. The chicken pakoras, house hot wings, Mongolian beef, and hunan chicken. I&#39;ll keep it short and simple the food was not up to par. 

We ordered the food spicy, but instead we received under spiced and under flavored dishes. The wings were slightly raw from the inside and lacked any flavor. The only dish that made me change my rating from a 2 to a 3 was the Mongolian beef which was stellar. 

Service is okay, cold but not as good as it should be. Which can sum up my experience at Changs Hot Wok."

One of my pet peeves with restaurants is inconsistency and since I cant judge these guys on that they only get 4-stars; however, the food I got today was 5 star worthy. Crispy egg roll that aren&#39;t doughy or have any trace of remnant oil. My main dish was the hicken Manchurian which was hands down one of the best I had. I do wish it was more spicy but I didn&#39;t add for extra spice. The only complaint would be that the chicken was ever so slightly overcooked.

For the 1-star&#39;ers maybe there is a lack of consistency here? or maybe if you expect something more spicy just ask, &#34;yo, I can feel my tongue and I don&#39;t like having sensation in my tongue, can you pour some more red hurt into the sauce&#34; - I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get your spice kick."

As it turns out, there are several Hakka wok places which are basically the same thing. Yay!

Service here was friendly and efficient, though I had to sigh a bit when our server took our orders without writing them down and then had to ask a few minutes later, &#34;Wait, what was that again?&#34; ...and she still got the order slightly wrong. I just wish servers wouldn&#39;t do that, it stresses me out :P.

The fried garlic tofu was excellent. And wow that green sauce--sweet and tasty but oh so spicy, it was hard to keep eating.

I ordered the sweet and sour bhazzia, which I was pleased to find was almost the same thing as the veggie coins I used to get at Bamboo Garden. The sauce was alarmingly neon red, but tasted perfectly delicious. Next time I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll get the manchurian sauce because I stole a little spoonful from my partner&#39;s manchurian beef and it was amazing. Not actually that spicy, despite having the double-pepper annotation on the menu.

Definitely recommend ordering the fresh lemon soda as well--I&#39;ve never had anything quite like it."

You may order the same dish 5 times in a row (I have) and the quality will be hit or miss each time. Sometimes the beef is tough or melt in your mouth tender. Sometimes the chicken is tender or like little pieces of jerky. The sauces may change on you or the amount of meat compared to veggies. The spring rolls are simple and amazing. The soups as well. They just need consistency to justify the prices.

The beef hot black garlic was just alright, same with the chicken Szechuan noodles. They skimp on the meat and give you a tiny bowl of rice in proportion to the entree size, and then when you ask for extra rice, they charge you without even letting you know.

I am obviously a big Paneer fan for those who read my reviews.. I love their paneer chilli, and manchurian. The rice and noodle dishes are great! Appetizer favs are the baby corn bhajias, dry paneer, spring rolls.. Order one of many different things to get a full experience instead of being a boring &#34;I&#39;ll have my usual&#34; kind of person. Be sure to have coconut water right out of the coconut!

I do wish they would pay a bit more attention to their service..

Chinese Indian Fusion an interesting dining concept that I have not seen before. I was not let down with my first visit to Chang&#39;s Hot Wok. When you image fusion, you picture chinese food in curry, however you are in for a surprise. The fusion is the blend of bold spices with chinese food that leaves you wanting more. For our appetizers, we tried the fried baby corn and fish pakora with the &#34;magic green sauce&#34;. The sauce is a delicious blend of spiciness and sweetness that is difficult to describe, but well worth the experience. The appetizers are also very unique and I can&#39;t wait to try the chicken pakora next time. For our entrees, we selected beef w/ okra, orange chicken, thai curry chicken, mango shrimp, and dry chili fish. Although the portions are not large, there is bold flavor in each of the dishes. You can see that great care is placed in cooking each dish with perfectly cooked protein in each of the dishes. The thai curry is probably the best curry dish I have ever had and that is coming from a chinese restaurant! Another major plus is that the dishes are flavorful, but not swimming in oil like many other asian restaurants. All and all, this is a up and coming restaurant that more people should try!


Pro: perfectly cooked dishes, not greasy at all, friendly staff, unique spin on asian dishes with bold spices that are not just heat, large restaurant

Cons: none

Hidden gem:
none"

Needless to say, although I ate half of a shrimp to taste the food they made me pay for it. The shrimp fried rice was dry as a bone.  I had to add so much soy sauce just to get a little flavor.

First of all, it&#39;s really cold out today so I wanted SPICY hot food - I figured ordering a lunch special with &#34;two hot peppers&#34; icon would be safe.  It was BARELY spicy.

I had the Hot &amp; Spicy Shrimp and it looks like it was sweet and sour with red/green peppers and onions.  The sauce was goopy and the shrimp was covered in corn starch and well, starchy tasting.

For $8 you also get an egg roll and fried rice.  Fried rice is mediocre with maybe 3 peas and 3 carrots in there.  Egg roll managed to stay crispy during my short drive back to work but nothing special about it at all.

I will go back to try some other stuff but I don&#39;t recommend this shrimp dish at all.

The meat is Halal, if you care."

I&#39;ve never been to someplace that can deliver orange chicken and curry in separate boxes, but now I know of one... and my experience was so good, I&#39;m looking forward to dining in sometime.

We picked up two entrees - the Manchurian Shrimp, and curry chicken.

Both were excellent. Both were insanely hot. No complaining about muted flavors here. The curry chicken was exceptional... almost as good as I&#39;ve had at our favorite Thai place near Chicago. Similarly, the shrimp dish had big, bold flavor. As far as I remember, the veggies were cooked right, and they gave you an ample amount of rice to ease the pain.

Either way, this place is good.  Some of the dishes can get spicy but you can ask them to back off a bit if you think it might be too much.
One word of advice, don&#39;t get the Masala tea.  It is not that great at all.  Even the waiter was telling us if we don&#39;t like it he can give us something else.  It tasted like water with egg and pepper and some sourness.  I guess some people might enjoy that, but not me.

The servers were very nice, but didn&#39;t come by too often. I think they only came by once after they served the food to make sure everything was ok. I wish they would have come around at least 1 more time to see if we needed our beverages to be refilled.

I believe this restaurant has a lot of potential, and I would definitely come back again to try something spicy."

Menu looked ok at first glance, so I sat at a table.  Asked the waiter for cashew chicken, wonton soup and egg rolls.  No egg rolls - only spring rolls.

Cashew chicken tasted terrible, extremely hot.  When I mentioned this politely to the waiter, he shrugged it off and said this is how they make it here.  He was completely indifferent and did not care.

Spring rolls were very small and wonton soup not great.  Above average prices on everything.

Bottom line: an all around terrible experience."

Apparently its fused with some Indian cuisine, but I saw mostly Chinese dishes with a few Indian spices thrown in the name ( but I shouldn&#39;t say much since I didn&#39;t actually taste it) 

We ordered the shrimp toast for an appetizer, which wasn&#39;t overly fried, and had this awesome BAM green sauce! It was sweet then gave you a kick 3 seconds later. 

We also ordered shrimp fried rice and a medley of broccoli, chicken beef and shrimp. The fried rice was light and not drenched in oil and soy sauce which was so refreshing since most places abuse their rice. The medley wasn&#39;t as salty as other places, which once again was refreshing because I could actually taste the food and not the salt. 

The place overall was aesthetically pleasing, and the prices were Ehh, decent for the family style dishes. 

I&#39;d also say it reminded me of Joy Yees...minus the bubble tea and the hustle and bustle of servers :)"

Here is what i ordered:

Tom Yum Soup.  Very fresh citrusy with a good amount of mushrooms in it.  Great Flavor.

Hot Garlic Tofu.   It looked dry, but once you bite into it, it has great texture and such great aroma.  and the extra green sauce they give you just ads a great flavor.  I recommend it.

My wife ordered the Stir Fried Okra.   They used really great okra, and my wife liked it better than what I ordered.  It was cooked very nicely  not to oily.   I would definitely try it again, after i try other things on the menu.

I had the Beef Basil Leaves.  Great flavor and aroma.  My only complaint was i think it should have more Basil.  That&#39;s the main reason i ordered it, besides wanting a beef dish.  But the flavor is good, I would get again.


I spent about 47$ with tip,  Its more than what I usually like to pay for 2 people But it was worth it.  Its definitely my favorite restaurant in this area.   

I used to go to the Old Hot Wok location before it closed down, this place keeps up the quality.

I cant wait to try the other things on the menu if it was as good as what I had last night."

 As for the food, I was expecting more indo-chinese, this place was more chinese.  There was a hair in one of our dishes, and didn&#39;t seem like the staff really cared. We even had to move the plate to another table just so we didn&#39;t have to look at it.

The food, however, was awful. I need to be more careful than to trust the palate of certain reviewers.  I am not sure what you consider to be good food, but this CERTAINLY is not.

The Lettuce Wraps were a 3.5 - not bad, not great
The Pad Thai was a 2 - too spicy to be called Pad Thai. We have eaten this dish in hundreds of restaurants and this is not Pad Thai
Finally, the Szechuan Broccoli was a disaster. Under-cooked broccoli in a bright red sauce. Szechuan? I think not. I think it was just Sriracha sauce thickened with corn starch. Absolutely inedible."

Our servers were quick and polite. No complaints there.

My only issue with this place is the FOOD. We ordered spring chicken and spring rolls for appetizers. Those were hot and quite good. The entrees, Szechuan Chicken and Sweet and sour shrimp were both a fiery fake red color, and not very tasty. Sesame chicken was good though. This restaurant is quite pricey for the quality and quantity of food delivered.  As nice as the decor and service was, the food itself was severely lacking in taste.

For dinner - my boyfriend ordered the general tso which was also great and I had the chicken seasame. I asked for the chicken seasame to be spicy - I have to admit, it wasn&#39;t as spicy as I would have liked, but I guess I would prefer it to be that then too spicy. Both were delicious.

First, it seems that some people come here expecting Chinese food. This is an Indo-Chinese fusion place, and you&#39;re not going to get what the standard American Chinese restaurant calls General Tso&#39;s or whatever. 

For those familiar with Indo-Chinese, read on. I&#39;ve experimented very little here, primarily because some of the sauces take off and others don&#39;t. I always get the schezwan veggie sticks, which are simply AMAZING. Make sure you get the green pepper-garlic sauce they serve on the side--our server forgot it once and I was MAD and had to keep reminding him to get it. The hot garlic tofu is great too, as are the wontons. The veggie manchow soup is spicy, garlicy and full of cilantro--yum! 

Now, the entrees. I&#39;ve tried the veggie Singapore noodles--it&#39;s pretty decent, albeit a tad yellow (turmeric?) and not as flavorful as the hakka. The hakka noodles has always been consistently good--albeit a tad greasy for me. I&#39;m never a big fan of the fried rice anywhere, but they do a decent veggie fried rice and (I&#39;ve heard) a good chicken fried rice. Try the ginger fried rice too--the one time I ordered it, it was good. 

I love the veggie balls in manchurian sauce. I&#39;ve never dared to try it with the other sauces, though I&#39;d say the hot black garlic sauce would go well with all meats/veggies. I&#39;ve tried the eggplant in the same sauce and that was YUMMEH. (It almost reminded me of the Thai basic garlic eggplant dish). 

The service. Ah, the front desk lady knows us fairly well, and sometimes she can be stand-offish with respect to late arrivals. They don&#39;t like that. However, we always had a penchant for arriving forty minutes before closing and they only sent us back once. She has great suggestions if she&#39;s taking your order. The other servers are polite and attentive, and one or two are occasionally a bit lax about filling water glasses, but we&#39;ve lived. 

(On a side note, the  last two times I went there, the flush in the first stall of ladies loo was &#34;broken,&#34; i.e. the flush was off the hinge or whatever you call it, and I&#39;m the good samaritan who keeps fixing it for you, guys, because someone is ALWAYS in the other stall.

There isn&#39;t any other Chinese-Indian place worth going to.  The flavors and spices will keep you wanting more.  The combination of Indian and Chinese sounds a bit strange but it works... and it works well!!!  My favorites (so far) are the Hot and Sour soup and the Chili Chicken.  The new place is brighter and has plenty of space if you bring a large group.  If you&#39;re lucky the chef will come out and share a few words and make recommendations for the next time you come back.

A word of warning: if you&#39;re not a &#34;spicy-fiend&#34; / sucker for punishment, like I am, you can ask that the spicy dishes be made more mild.

To start off, the moment me and my girlfriend stepped into the restaurant we were anxiously greeted and seated. Observing my surroundings, I notice the decor carried a very similar Chinese feel as you would see in a local restaurant in Chinatown. It was painted with white paint on top with a border that separated a deep crimson followed by a golden dragon art piece located towards the center of wall. Nonetheless, the atmosphere was pleasant overall.

Service:
It was only a short period of time when we were offered drinks, and a decision on our entrees. At first we were given soup that looked as if it could be some sort of sauce for our sweet and sour chicken, yet only to find out that it was the incorrect order. But the waiter was polite and apologized by not charging me. The food was relatively quick, despite how packed the place was on a Saturday night. I did ask for a pair of chopsticksbut by the time I received the chopsticks me and my girlfriend was about half way through our food--not sure why they don&#39;t have them out at first since it&#39;s nearly a standard for most Asian restaurants. Overall, the service swift and with a little  inconsistency as it was extremely spot on at first and dwindled a bit as time went on.

Food:
Choosing two main dishes, we selected Dragon &amp; Pheonix and Sweet and Sour Chicken. Broadly speaking, I will say that the food portions tend to be a bit smaller than what I was anticipating for a dish being two digits, but 1 entree can most certainly fill one person up.  The Dragon &amp; Pheonix was a combination dish that involved chicken and shrimp along with veggies such as celery, mushrooms, and onions. Though my mom makes a very similar dish, this dish was very well balanced in terms of the sauce. But I was hoping for it to contain more shrimp, as my dish had only four pieces of shrimp and maybe 18-20 pieces of chicken.  I&#39;ve had many bad shares of Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken, but this dish was definitely one of the better if not best dishes I&#39;ve had for S&amp;S Chicken. It had fresh cuts of pineapples and veggies with tender pieces of chicken. The sauce was served at just the right amount and was never to saucy or sweet for even the chicken pieces drenched in sauce. Overall the food was delicious.

Lasting Impressions:
I would say during dinner it would most likely average at about $15 a person and probably around $10 at lunch. Thus, if you&#39;re there to try it out at first, then I would consider maybe try their lunch specials to see if the food will justify the price, then maybe consider dinning in at dinner time. The service met my expectations, which I tend to be very picky at times so it should meet mostly everyone&#39;s expectations as well. The food is price is relatively expensive, but the quality is definitely there. Perhaps if the portions were just a little increased and maybe a little more shrimp in the Pheonix &amp; Dragon, I would be a very happy man. In short summary, Chang&#39;s Hot Wok is a great place to eat out with friends and family for whatever the occasion maybe."

I&#39;ve been kinda skeptical to try it because the previous restaurant was slowly going downhill and the memory leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  But I decided to go there because it&#39;s stupid to hate a restaurant without giving them a chance.

So my friend and I went there on 06/24/11.  There were barely any customers there and I think that I&#39;m not the only one with bad memories.  Trying to start a similar restaurant in the place of an old one can be troublesome like that.  Anyway, we sat at the booth next to the windows.  The reason I mention that detail is because they have a fish tank that stands in between us and where the waiter stands ready to greet new customers.  One of my issues with this restaurant was that the waiter doesn&#39;t come around to check on us, even though there were barely any customers.  He should at least take a peek to see how we&#39;re doing, but we had to call him every time we wanted something.  Fix that and they might get an extra star next time.

Onto the food.  We ordered Vegetable Szechuan Stix as our appetizer, which turned out pretty good.  The sauce they provided makes it even better.  Oh, we also ordered lemon soda which is one of my favorite drinks.  They tasted great but some of you may want to request extra sugar since I like mine sweet.  For the main course my friend got Szechuan Soft Noodles and I got Singapore Fried Rice with a request of mixed chicken and beef.  We got our orders within 5-7 minutes, which seemed kinda fast.  My friend&#39;s dish was a little too spicy for him but tasted good.  Mine was great except that I think they used too much Tumeric powder or they didn&#39;t mix it good enough to leave behind that taste.  But the dish overall tasted good, especially when combined with soy sauce.  Again, we had to call the waiter to get refills on our drinks instead of him coming to us.  The waiter really needs to improve his skills.

Otherwise, the food is great.  I would definitely go there again just for the food.  So those of you who&#39;ve been having mixed feelings about the old restaurant...you no longer have to fear.  Go and try the place and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be surprised.  Maybe when they get enough customers on a regular basis they&#39;ll hire a better waiter ;)"

Nice atmosphere, calm and warm.  Hubby ordered the orange chicken, and I ordered a yellow curry of some sort (can&#39;t recall exactly).  Mine was good, just not exactly what I expected, but hubby&#39;s was AMAZING!  They even gave us more rice, they were very nice and attentive--excellent service.  We went back today to try the orange chicken again, just as carryout to share, as the portion is quite large.  It was just as wonderful as last time--best orange chicken ev-er!!!

Not only is the service exceptionally friendly, but the food is fantastic. Traditional Irish specialties like Shepherd&#39;s Pie and Boxty, great salads, burgers and wings make this a family friendly option that works for even the pickiest eater. It gets crowded on weekends, but the wait is rarely long and the food is definitely worth it. Big screens line the walls so you won&#39;t miss the game, and there&#39;s a decent selection of beer and wine. Prices are in line, and there&#39;s plenty of parking. A great way to pass the time and enjoy a good meal."

Like a line waiting at the door! Food was good, fun atmosphere, and it wasn&#39;t so loud that I couldn&#39;t hear my friends. Nice prices for the amount of food. I wish I hadn&#39;t ordered chicken on my salad though. It was bland and didn&#39;t seem to be very fresh. Maybe it was microwaved? I&#39;m not sure.

I can&#39;t remember the exact deal we snagged on Groupon, but it was around a 50% discount. I&#39;ve lived nearby for years and never noticed the place, and this was the perfect opportunity to give it a shot. 

First off, pretzel buns. That made the decision for me. I couldn&#39;t decide which burger I wanted but I&#39;m always up for the unconventional and went for the Brie &amp; Pear. I didn&#39;t regret that for a second, it was delicious! Timothy M. went crazy for his Pub Burger and the ultimate Jameson sauce. I can&#39;t deny that I stole some for my fries, it was outstanding!

We made sure to get our money&#39;s worth with the salted caramel brownie dessert. Between salted caramel and pretzel buns, I was in heaven! Our server was excellent and very attentive. I can&#39;t wait to come back!"

This will be a relatively short review, at least for me, as most of &#34;O&#39;Hares Pub and Restaurant&#34; is pretty self-explanatory.

So, yeah, it&#39;s an Irish Pub and Eatery.  There&#39;s gonna be Harp, Guinness, Jameson&#39;s and the other magic potions that seem to represent the Emerald Isle nearly as well as the Lucky Charms guy.  I haven&#39;t asked about aged Jameson&#39;s or other fine whiskies, but I will next time to see if they&#39;ve got that covered.  

I like that aged stuff.  I&#39;m getting all saliverated just thinking about a couple of finger&#39;s worth in a short glass and a side of ice water.  And I know &#34;saliverated&#34; is not a word, but it should be, so it stays.

Anyhow, back to this review.  It&#39;s clean, the folks are friendly and there is a lot of Irish fare on the menu.  As others have said, the burgers are excellent, but everything else I&#39;ve gotten has been beyond decent.  For bar food, it&#39;s excellent.  In reality, it&#39;s not bar food.  They&#39;ve got the typical bar food also, wings, chips, yada, yada, so don&#39;t worry that those things aren&#39;t there either.  It&#39;s just that the entrees consistently rise above that standard.

I guess that&#39;s my only thing with this place and it&#39;s not even really a criticism.  I&#39;m not sure if it wants to be a bar or a restaurant, but I think it does the bar/casual eatery thing pretty well, so I&#39;m not going to mess with their mojo.  I haven&#39;t wandered into the video gaming area, as that&#39;s not my thing, but if it&#39;s yours, rock on.

I&#39;m going to say again, the food is excellent for a bar/pub.  You can get a pint anywhere, but this type of really good food at a pub is rare.  Get on over there and show these guys some love.  It&#39;s a great local place/small business that deserves a bit of local support."

It&#39;s delicious!) &amp; Irish favorites.  We paid them an inaugural visit for the Hawks season opener.  And just like the previous establishment the interior is also pretty much the same - they have plenty of flat-screen TV&#39;s all around so it was easy to watch the game wherever you sit AND they play the game audio as well, which is a must for me if I&#39;m going out primarily to watch the game. They have various drink and food specials each day and Thursdays are 1/2 price Build-Your-Own-Burger night.  

Hubby had the burger special and their burgers are HUGE.  He tried the house made chips which were some of the best house made chips we&#39;ve ever had.  I had the Cork Reuben which wasn&#39;t as jam-packed with corned beef as at other places but it was still plenty &amp; honestly more of a normal serving size of meat for a sandwich anyway - and very good.  Their french fries have a sprinkling of rosemary on them, which is my favorite way to enjoy french fries, so I was a happy camper.

They were very busy before the game with families, couples and a full bar of patrons and during the first period with just the bartender (perhaps he is the owner/manager) &amp; one server waiting on all the tables (this is exactly the same situation we had our first visit to Sheep &amp; Fiddle as well) but they were both very nice &amp; and apologized for any delays we experienced, but it wasn&#39;t bad (a third employee appeared to tend bar at some point).  They mostly have hightops and the bar area to sit but there are a handful of lower tables in the main dining area as well.

Oh, and they have Wednesday Night Trivia, too. :-D"

I have actually only been here for dinner and lunch, never to imbibe, so I can&#39;t say much for that.  But it&#39;s actually a decent place to come with kids.  They have crayons and kid cups.  How many pubs have that?  I&#39;ll tell you not a lot.
They have a small kids meal menu which is good enough.

The food is good.  It&#39;s not the best Irish food I&#39;ve ever had, but it is pretty good.  Sometimes the food is a little salty, but that&#39;s just how it goes sometimes.  This time I had a hankering for some corned beef and cabbage.  It was pretty good.  A little different than what I usually have, but not bad.  Oh they have poutine!  It&#39;s hard to find poutine outside of Montreal/Quebec.  And usually it&#39;s not good.  But it&#39;s good here.  The gravy is tasty, the cheese is good and the fries too.  Maybe a little more gravy would be nice.

I ate about half of it and my boyfriend just about finished it after having his bbq pork burger. The burger he said was delicious as well. Oh!

Fish and chips was the worst I have ever tasted- nasty breading and nasty fries to go along with it.  The pretzel appetizer that used to be good is now generic and bad. They used to be more firm and now they are huge, extra doughy and almost disgusting with some cheese or something baked into it.  I tried their dessert- warm, cinnamon sugary donuts.  SOOOO good.  The only sauce worth dipping them in though was their homemade custard sauce.  Raspberry and caramel not so good. How about CHOCOLATE?  No drink menus STILL.  Service was too slow for me though.

Let&#39;s start with the positives, shall we?

1.  The location is great!  Located in Bartlett at the corner of Army Trail Road and Route 59. 
2.  The owners are always present and engaged!  Bill and his wife, Peggy, are super sweet and truly concerned about your experience. Plus, they&#39;re funny. So, if your dining/drinking mates bore you...they will make up for it. 
3.  Paul is a very knowledgeable bartender. He works side by side with Bill, but Paul likes to throw in a little flair from time to time. And he will mix up something special from his previous bar life if you ask nicely. My cousin isn&#39;t a beer girl and didn&#39;t feel like wine, so she asked for something sweet but not too sweet and Paul creatively won her over. She doesn&#39;t like people, but she did like Paul. ;-)
4.  The burgers. I really liked my last burger here. It was juicy and hand packed. I almost didn&#39;t try it, but I&#39;m glad I did. 
5.  Boxty. Have you tried boxty?  It&#39;s like a thin potato pancake like crepe filled with...I had mine filled with the Guinness stew. It was exceptional!
6.  The bathrooms. Neat and tidy. No complaints here. 
7.  The other patrons. We have been here for all different occasions including St Patrick&#39;s Day Weekend. Everyone is friendly. No one annoyed me or was rude. 
8.  It&#39;s a happy place. I feel happy when I visit even though it&#39;s a bit darker and a pub atmosphere. I think it&#39;s the people that keep it upbeat. 
9.  My husband likes the meatloaf. I tasted it and it was very good, but the more important part is that this means I don&#39;t have to make meatloaf. 
10.  They have a little bit of everything for everybody. The menu is diverse and keeps people happy. See #7 &amp; #8 above. 
11.  They are involved in the community and they want to be. These are stellar small business owners who want to help others. 

And the negatives:

The inside is small, slightly cramped. There are slot machines that just look like they don&#39;t belong and take up floor space. 

However the place is clean. The bar is nice as well, lots of space. 

Now the reason I&#39;m giving it three stars. 

The beer was pricey and there were no specials. Which is odd since the bar takes up most of this place!! For an Irish place I&#39;d suspect them to welcome you in with good deals on booze and sit your ass down! Instead for the type of dining room you&#39;re sitting in you should NOT be paying that much for a pint!! 

The only reason it gets three stars. 

Our food was amazing!!!

The burger was incredible. Honestly probably one of the best in the burbs. No joke. Try it. You&#39;re welcome."

We sat down at a table and our waiter came over just a few minutes later.  He was extremely friendly and brought us our iced tea orders right away.  We decided to get an appetizer platter to start with so we could try 3 different items.  We chose the fried green beans (different &amp; pretty tasty), loaded potato skins (good) and chicken fingers (really good!).  We then ordered the Beef &amp; Guiness Stew to share.  Our waiter brought our entree and said the chef had split it for us - two LARGE bowls of stew, very nicely presented.  It was really good and I couldn&#39;t even finish my 1/2 portion.

husband&#39;s birthday and he wanted to go to the Sheep and the Fiddle since it was his
favorite Irish spot. So we went, and the sign was the same, the inside was the same.
The menu had the items I remembered and as far as I could tell the same name as
before. We ordered our usual Fish and Chips. The servers were different, not that
that matters but the bearded look always stood out to me so there ya go. 

When our dinner arrived it was a much bigger portion than I remembered, which isn&#39;t a bad thing! But the taste of it was different. I didn&#39;t say anything, because after all it could just be me. Immediately my husband says, this tastes different, and that goes on to &#34;I think the fish might be old?&#34; I agreed it wasn&#39;t the same taste wise, the fish wasn&#39;t what did it in for me though, it was the fries. The fries used to have a different flavor, rosemary I think and that just kind of set them apart for me. We got the bill and right on the top it was O&#39;Hares Pub. I gotta say I&#39;m a little surprised that this wasn&#39;t a more advertised change. I didn&#39;t see any signs on the door or anything.

We both left disappointed and a little cheated. It was your average bar food, and for the price I&#39;d rather go to our other Irish haunt. I was surprised to see that it was the same chef? Really? I mean I wasn&#39;t that frequent of a diner but I was frequent enough to know what it should have tasted like. I guess the alternate chef was cooking that day. 

Maybe I&#39;ll give them another try sometime in the future but sadly it won&#39;t be anytime soon. I&#39;m going to miss that little fiddling sheep. Play on little buddy, wherever you may be."

I give:
1 star for the place being clean. 
1 star for the waitress being nice and friendly and the beer being alright. 

Not more because:
With a group we had a number of different dishes - all mediocre. Salmon which requires a knife to cut it? Then you know the cook is doing something wrong. Pork chop being dry? How can this go wrong? Shepard&#39;s pie being pretty tasteless - how difficult is it to get this right?

So the food is at the best nothing to write home about. Seriously it&#39;s not a reason to choose this place. 

Draft beers are okay. 

Interior is boring. Doesn&#39;t have much of an Irish pub feeling - at least if you ever had the chance to pay a real one a visit to compare. 

Service was friendly, but food served very slow.  Overall it took about 1,5 hours to get the main course. 

Can&#39;t recommend this place for dinner."

This place provides an option. The food is good enough. It&#39;s a nice place as in friendly and clean so atmosphere is 4 stars. It&#39;s a nice place to hang out because it&#39;s quiet enough to talk. Plenty of flat screens and they&#39;ll put your game on if it&#39;s not playing when you walk in. They&#39;ve done that for me several times. Try it out for yourself and tell me if you&#39;d seriously give it 5 stars. Seriously? If you live in Chicagoland with some of the best food in the USA?

Here&#39;s the breakdown:
I came in with the restaurant having one person inside.  Kind of discouraging since this is supposedly a &#34;hot and new&#34; restaurant.  No worries, I&#39;m not here for popularity.  Upon looking at the menu, the entree which do not come with any sides is priced at $8.99.  So ultimately, you will get a leg and thigh or a palm sized beef (Steer crazy) for $9!  Not a good start.   Sides (rice, quinoa, or kale salad) is an additional $2+.  I ordered the steer crazy with kale, and lentil soup = $15.24.  TASTE: bleeehhhhh!  The soup was tasteless, the beef&#39;s sauce had an after taste of can followed with bland tasting meat, and the kale- well it tasted like Kale.  Definitely not worth the price.  As a matter of fact, not worth the visit.  
I can sympathize with the long wait for the food since they have to warm up the beef or whatever they have to do but again, just like the price, it was not worth the wait.

I love supporting small business but it must come with good value, service, and taste for me to ever return.  I&#39;m afraid this is my first and last visit.  Glad I tried something HOT &amp; NEW!"

It&#39;s like a hot bar with paleo, gluten-free or vegetarian options. For lunch, I was given the option to pick a protein and a side. They say the food is wild caught or grass fed... great for paleo diets. +1

Initially, it looks like they were going to do a daily menu but it looks like people complained so now they&#39;re trying to do a set menu and changing it up once in a while? Personally I&#39;d rather they have a set menu because I can at least tell what my options are before I go in (or at least announce on their FB what their current menu is). I think it would also help if they took a nice picture of the protein/sides and taped it up on the glass. When I got there, they had to open every single tray to show me my options. I can imagine that to be very drying to the food and time consuming if people were waiting. 

My protein (salmon) was dry but I think I was supposed to get a sauce on it. Even so, the meat was very dry so I don&#39;t think sauce would have helped much. The vegetables I got were delicious. 

The person working there was very friendly and explained everything to me well. +1

Their to-go container is a #5 which is recyclable in Illinois. +1

I will try them again because I really want them to succeed. Hopefully they can find a way to get the protein from drying out. I look forward to what they&#39;ll do!"

I expected I was going to get the standard &#34;salad in a tortilla&#34;, but this was anything but. Instead of a soft flour tortilla, the &#34;wrap&#34; was a big, crunchy cabbage leaf - completely changing the texture profile of the dish. Inside was a lightly seasoned combination of kale, sweet potato, red peppers, quinoa, and probably a few other things. I liked the layering of colors and flavors. The chef obviously spent some time thinking through the flavor combinations and presentation. It feels really good eating fresh, clean food prepared to this level.

I will definitely go back and try their other dishes."

I should have thoroughly read the reviews before taking my family there.  Don&#39;t make the same mistake I did. The menu is hard to understand.  We ordered the Tika chicken, the beef wrap, the salmon wrap, and the chicken wings.  Here is my honest review.  The Tika was tasteless even though we asked for spicy, the beef wrap seemed uncooked and the salmon wrap smelled bad.  Both wraps had old soggy cold vegetables. The worst was the cold slimy chicken wings with no flavor and the skin looked uncooked.  They were nothing like any wings I ever had, and did not look like the picture.  The food was expensive, the naan was from Costco, and they charge for water from the dispenser.  We ended up leaving our food on the table, that&#39;s how horrible we thought it was.

Like so many other reviewers, I want to cheerlead to wish Omar and his team success. But I think there is somewhat of a lack of actual restauranting experience happening here. I have eaten at restaurants across all of North America and most of those have a tilt to vegetarian, so I have a pretty broad perspective when I say I support and welcome his concept...but it was not overly polished yet.

My suggestion? If fresh is your focus, then you should not have drying out foods visible along the counter. The practical answer is to simply not to have them so visible. We all know it takes a while to build a customer base and churn your offerings hourly.In the interim, please don&#39;t let me see what time can do to fresh ingredients... 

But that is a minor detail. The actual quality of the food is their focus. My curried lentils were a nice texture and a lighter flavor. Brown rice as a side was a nicely flavored supplement to it. My friend enjoyed her salad very much, adding avocado to enhance it. Gratefully, the food experience outweighed the uneven experience at the counter.

We still have high hopes for their content, their commitment to the quality of the ingredients and the impact on the larger food chain of his restaurant. I&#39;m confident that their traffic will increase and that will raise the experience bar. We even smiled when understanding and supporting Omar&#39;s struggle to find a way to fully execute his commitment to composting. One more reason to support their thoughtful model!"

I should have checked the closing time beforehand because we got there around 9:30pm and didn&#39;t know they closed at 10pm. The server who served us was very patient with us and didn&#39;t rush us. He let us take our time to order and placed our orders right away. We all got burgers and so we were looking forward to the bottomless garlic fries, but it was closing already. Sad. 

For appetizer, we got the donut tower. It was so good! It was hot and fresh out of the kitchen with strawberry and chocolate dipping sauce. If you&#39;ve never had it here, you must try it out.

I got the &#34;burnin love&#34; burger and it wasn&#39;t as hot as I expected. When it came out, I was surprised to see the big green pepper on top of my burger. I took a bit of it and just left it on the side of my plate. The fries looked like it was over cooked and didn&#39;t taste any garlic sauce on it. So that was a bit disappointing. 

The servers here were very friendly. Our server came and asked us if we wanted fries and ordered 2 extra orders for us since the kitchen was closing. He also came back multiple times to refill our water as well. The customer service here was good."

The hit: 

I am a burger and fries gal so I do I LOVE their menu. (They have heart healthy options too) Yummy wraps, soups, and salads. I&#39;m especially a fan of their wide selection of drinks. Love the flavors, the fruity mixtures, and the presentation as they often come out in cool looking glasses which just make them look all the more delicious. 

I love the diner atmosphere, with a mish-mash of random memorabilia, and I&#39;m a fan of the comfy booths! They give helium balloons out to kids if you ask so that&#39;s fun . And they have a neat loyalty program with gets you a free burger or shake during your bday month. You can also just stop buy and pick up your free item to go. No need to make a full meal out of it. 

The miss:

Service. Ugh! Sometimes we&#39;ll get a great waiter/waitress that will check on us frequently, take the time to explain the menu or promotions, and be speedy with our drinks, food and bill. And then other times... it&#39;s pretty bad. We have to wait forever for something as simple as a napkin or silverware! I have even had times when people seated after us have had their food delivered before us. :(

I was a little concerned because the past few times we ordered here was just okay.  Tonight, I ordered the Banzai Burger with Steak Fries.  What I got was burger meat slapped in between buns with old looking lettuce, old looking tomatoes, pineapple that was also just slapped on, and the sauce everywhere.  It looked like a train wreck!  I thought that maybe it tasted better than it looked, but I was wrong.  The consistency was just mush and did not appeal to my sense of taste.  The Steak fries were minimal and I even ordered a side of extra steak fries for the fact that the amount placed with my order has been small.  But, nope, I didn&#39;t get what I asked for.  From my previous experience, they skimp on the fries if you order to go.

The good:  The server behind the bar who took my payment and gave me my order.  She was nice and friendly.  Maybe if I ordered something else, it would be better.  It&#39;s sad because my favorite burger from them is the Banzai Burger.  Unfortunately, tonight&#39;s experience will be the last time to order this burger.

I realize menus change and I fully understand that recalls/shortages happen (the eggs) but this is literally the only thing I go there for and no substitutions can be made to make it more similar to the original menu item.

It was also super busy. They have an online reservation system so when you check in you can walk around the mall and they will text you when your table is ready. You can also keep track of your place in line via a web URL they text you when you first check in. This would be very cool, if they had not removed our names from the list without seating us! Luckily we happened to be right there when I noticed they were seating a party of 4 that had been behind us in line and that my name had disappeared from the list. I asked the hostess what was going on and she put us back on the list but not before another two more people were seated ahead of us. She also didn&#39;t offer any apologies. Not cool, Red Robin!

I ordered a bbq chicken wrap of some kind in a spinach tortilla with fries and raspberry limeade.  The food arrived and 1) The wrap was completely crusted over on one side - hard enough you could tap it and hear it.  2) The fries were only lukewarm.  I sent it back, which I rarely do.

There were two manager types holding court at a table in the middle of the restaurant.  Stupid, they should be to the side and out of sight.  Employees stopping by, munching food at their table etc.  Looks very sloppy.  But more importantly, when my food was sent back it went right by them, they briefly inspected it and passed it on.  No inquiry, not trip behind the line - nothing.  Ok I thought... then within only a few minutes somebody else sent their food back and it got the same treatment.

Still no manager goes behind the line to check his kitchen and find out what is going on. They just stand their doing nothing...  completely useless and a waste of salary.

The second attempt reached my table in a timely fashion, delivered by one of the managers.  I good naturedly asked him if he had noticed the tortilla problem.  He refused to even acknowledge it, saying only that &#34;those sandwiches are tricky&#34;  ?  After biting into the second wrap it was only then that I knew how bad the first one was.  The second attempt was far superior in taste and texture.  The first one was garbage.  The fries were also hot the second time.

I had sat so that I could watch the line and see how they work.  As I ate I wondered about the tortilla problem and what could cause it.  Very strange, either it had laid in the open air for a long time, or it was a heat lamp issue.  I timed two separate orders that sat waiting for service.  One sat 8 minutes and another sat for 7.  Personally I don&#39;t think it was a heat lamp problem because the sandwich was not hot, probably the tortillas sat unwrapped in the fridge.

One minor thing of note, they now serve fries in a metal ring that is sloped down in the front.  My first plate was sat on the table with the slope backwards resulting in the fries being obscured and difficult to reach.  Minor problem to be sure, but so easily correctible.

Does any of this matter?  Not to anyone else working in that restaurant at that moment, managers, line crew or service.  But I 100% guarantee it matters to corporate and the people who work to polish that menu to perfection.  The service people are always the nicest, they just need some leadership to show them how to be excellent."

It was 10:15. We knew we might be pushing it, so we asked the hostest if they were okay with taking us and she was nice about it said it would be fine.
Well, apparently it wasn&#39;t because we had possibly the worst server I&#39;ve ever seen. I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s new or what. She was kinda rude. She didn&#39;t even introduce herself. I think her name was Audrey. 
She gave my mom a glass with an onion on the side. She just had an attitude in general. The things she would say at times were just off. 
She kept cutting my fiance off when he was trying to pay. 
I was super excited that they had the Hawks game on, so I was a little irked that the manager turned the tv off that I was clearly watching, but kept the one in the front near them on. 
I know that no one wants to stay late, but honestly, we only kept them 10 minutes after close.

We were seated right away. The only delay was to get our drinks. Erin, our waitress, was very nice.

I ordered the Keep it Simple, with sauteed mushrooms. It came with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onion as well. For my sides, I went with the Freckled Fruit Salad, Steamed Broccoli, and a side salad with the balsamic vinagrette.

My salad came out first; nothing too special. I special ordered with no croutons and the dressing on the side. The salad actually had cucumber, which I loathe, but I actually sucked it up and ate one. Very tasteless to me. As for the rest of the salad, it had tomatoes, lettuce, cheddar cheese, and radish. A very solid salad.

As for my main entree, my burger was cooked medium well, even though I wanted medium. No big deal, still tasty. The steamed broccoli was very good, and they actually steam it, not cook it in butter and say it&#39;s steamed. The freckled fruit salad was yummy too. It had mandarin oranges, apples, strawberries, and watermelon.

I&#39;m a huge ketchup guy on burgers, but the meat had enough flavor with the veggies that none was needed.

The service was quick and friendly. The food was good. It was less than 60 bucks without tip. We had 2 beers (dad did), and sister had a diet coke. 

It&#39;s a chain, but they do things the right way. I LOVE THEIR SEASONING. I wanted to steal it, but I&#39;m trying to become a policeman, so I don&#39;t want that on my conscious! I hope it&#39;s available in stores soon! 

Highly recommended for all ages!"

Updated Review:

The Stratford Red Robin was recently renovated and I had to drop a full two stars off of my previous review.

Before the restaurant&#39;s update, it was a fun dining experience, complete with friendly wait staff, charmingly cliched Americana decor, and an inviting atmosphere.

Now... well... Ugh. 

Post-renovation, there is now a greater physical distinction between the traditional dining room, and the expanded bar section, presumably in an attempt to drive up profitable alcohol sales. It would appear this has slightly reduced overall seating capacity. Also, the staff now wear black slacks and black button down shirts. It all looks a feels a bit awkward. And we were completely taken off guard when we walked in and were asked &#34;do you have a reservation?&#34; Wha? Huh? A reservation? At a Red Robin? In a suburban mall? There were only two of us, making our semi-regular visit for Tavern Double Tuesday. We were told it would be about a 20 min. wait before we could be seated. We&#39;ve NEVER had to wait before. And that 20 min. turned into 45 or 50. Odd, since we could see plenty of vacant seating throughout the dining room and bar area.

It would appear that Red Robin has decided to re-imagine its brand and try to move up-scale. The decor has been toned down dramatically, and lost its comfortable, inviting character. The familiar American kitsch is gone, instead replaced by corporate-approved, manufactured art that&#39;s been focus-group tested to appeal to hipster foodies. But this is a Red Robin. IN A MIDDLE CLASS SUBURB! You&#39;re not going to attract the type of clientele you&#39;re targeting, and simply going to drive folks like me away.

Same great food as before, but the dramatically changed dining experience has completely put me off my appetite for Red Robin, and I haven&#39;t been back since.

Original Review:

Five stars? For a chain restaurant? In a suburban mall? Yeah - i&#39;m shocked too. We&#39;re continually surprised by the creative flavor combinations, special menu items, and quality ingredients. No white tomatoes, no wilted lettuce, and no tiny overpriced and overcooked patties like I got a few weeks ago at another supposedly high-end specialty burger joint in an expensive northern &#39;burb.

If you&#39;re not into the bottomless steak fries, RR offers plenty of options including a surprising slaw with whole grain mustard! Plenty of buns - including a gluten free option. And don&#39;t forget to check out the specialty shakes, and tasty house-made tortilla chips!

But Five stars? The clincher for me was on our most recent visit. They were extremely busy, and there was apparently a miscommunication between myself, our server, and the kitchen as the burger I ordered was not the burger that arrived at our table. The manager was extremely proactive, put a rush order through to get me the correct burger, and even offered to comp my order on our bill. No drama. No fuss. Just top notch customer service with no accusatory tone or back and forth to asses blame.

A five star chain burger joint at a suburban mall... who&#39;da thunk it."

We attended a grandson&#39;s birthday lunch.  This is a large space and they were busy from the minute they opened.  But it wasn&#39;t a kiddy-land type place.  We had drinks (margaritas were very weak, their only downfall).  The menu focuses on some never-before-seen burger combinations, but there are lots of other choices.  We started with some excellent onion rings - nice thick slices of onion.  Also had humus with plenty of both pita bread and fresh veggies.  I went with the fish and chips and had some of the nicest thick cut pieces of cod I&#39;ve ever had in fish and chips.  Fresh, moist, full of flavor.  And decent fries.

So the food was excellent.  The burger eaters (everyone else) all praised their choices too.  Service was very attentive and friendly.  And they took good care of the kids, with a kids menu more extensive and flexible than you usually see.  But, again, this wasn&#39;t a restaurant only focused on the kids.  They did a great job for everyone."

There are some new menu items, and a new format for the menu -- it used to be a big honking two-sided sheet, now it&#39;s an actual bound &#34;book&#34; style menu. I like the new appetizer options -- you can pick one or two smaller portions of things like mozzarella sticks, homemade thick-cut chips, jalapeno coins, etc and it&#39;s a good size for sharing without filling you up before you even get your meal.

Our service was good, but I did notice the people behind us having some difficulty -- sounded like their sandwiches were taking too long, but the manager was dealing with it and comping at least one of them.

&#34;Zagat rated #1 burger&#34;... eh I had better. When I first went to red robbin, I loved the concept and the taste of the burger. Where else can you get a burger with egg on top or guacamole. The burger itself was cooked to perfection as well as the ingredients that topped the specialty burger which came with bottomless fries. If you opt to get the strawberry lemon, this comes with endless refills. The downside is the long wait and the small burger size. I believe over the years, the burger meat has decreased in size. Given the price you pay, the burger is no bigger than a quarter pounder at McD. For this reason alone, it loses one star.

My experience at the Stratford Square location was very good, in fact. In particular, I noticed the manager, or shift manager, ensuring that the customers had their needs filled, and was friendly. The server also did very well. No kids at the time we ate, which was a plus.

My wife ordered her usual Whiskey River BBQ wrap, which was very good (the watermelon with the wraps was something new), while I tried the new pub burger. I didn&#39;t like it as much as my standard burger, the mushroom and swiss, but that wasn&#39;t the fault of the kitchen staff. I made up for it by eating a bunch of fries.

My one friend got there before us, and she nabbed us a booth because it was filling up quickly, and there would have been a wait.

My one friend ordered the crispy chicken sandwich (more on that later), my other friend ordered the chili queso dip and soup as her meal, and I ordered the french onion soup and the Ensenada Chicken Platter.  

The french onion soup had the crispy crust of cheese on the top that I like so much, and my friend&#39;s queso dip was fantastic as well--she really liked the jalapeno tortilla chips that came with it.  I was enjoying everything about my chicken ensenada as well until...&#34;the incident&#34;...

All of a sudden, my one friend stops eating her crispy chicken sandwich, and her eyes got huge.  She spit out the bite in her mouth and said &#34;my chicken is RAW&#34;.  It really, really was 1,000% raw in the middle.  Completely cold, totally pink, raw.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found for a long time, but I did get the attention of the manager.

When told about the sandwich and shown, he was absolutely horrified.  He whisked that plate away SO fast.  When he came back, he explained that the chicken patty had broken into two flaps and the one hadn&#39;t cooked at all, but then it got folded over.  Ooook.

Either way, the manager really did make it right.  ALL of our meals were comped, and we got a free dessert as well as my friend got a $20 gift card.

Oh, and if anybody is keeping score, I stopped eating my chicken after that..."

Ordered the whiskey bourbon chick wrap with a side of mac &amp; cheese and a BLTA /chix Tortilla soup. Server was friendly enough.  When the food was delivered I noticed the cheese on the mac/cheese looked burnt and microwaved and sure enough when I cut into it it was stone cold in the middle.  Had the server return it for onion rings which came out fine.  My problem is that 3 tables over from us was a Red Robins managers meeting of about 6 individuals.  I know this because they all had Navy shirts with the RR logo. Not one &#34; manager&#34; offered an apology for the cold food we returned or even acknowledged that we had returned something.

When I&#39;m craving any kind of burger, there&#39;s no place I&#39;d rather go.  Red Robin knows how to make burgers; no matter how odd a certain menu offering might sound, if they put it on the menu, chances are it&#39;s delicious. 

I&#39;ve tried a couple of their shakes, and I was definitely satisfied--they have a relatively small selection of shakes, but what they have is tasty. I haven&#39;t ordered any of their mixed drinks, but from reading the drink menu, they&#39;re as creative with those as they are with their burgers. 

All of that should be true of any Red Robin (since it&#39;s, you know, a chain). For this location in particular, I can say that the servers are always friendly and attentive.  The food here is slightly pricier than at other restaurants aimed at the same market, but I think they make it worth your while."

We ordered many rolls but the Avocado Torch roll is by far their best. OMG so tasty! 

The restaurant is small, seating about 25 people, but the service is great! It is clean, the food is prepared well, and I&#39;m always full when I leave. The wait time is pretty typical; and they bring you edamame while you wait The only downside is that it&#39;s a little on the pricey side. 

The presentation is always great too!!"

The last experience was worse visit after visit. Not sure if staff has changed but sushi is not the same and service is not caring anymore. 
I am havy sushi eater and tried hundreds different rolls , nigiri or sashimi. 
Today was my last visit in Sushi Ai because in my opinion it is not acceptable to give to the customer rool that is made with old tuna and gummy burned and bitter crab. Maybe person who made that was blind or did it in purpose or maybe this was hist first sushi but when I told it to the service that this roll taste terrible she said that ...yep some people don&#39;t like that taste and so I can mark it as no no. Seriously???? If people don&#39;t like it means that something is wrong whit it. 
You can find my picture and you can compare it with other spicy tataki. I am disappointed :("

We found this little place and were not disappointed. As I drove up I thought the place was shut down or out of business. It is hard to tell but just to the right of the closed down business is Sushi Ai. We showed up as it opened on a weekday, 5pm, and were seated without a reservation immediately. 

Quick Japanese fact:
Ai in Japanese can be interpreted as love.

It had been a long day at work so I decided to splurge a bit. I got a large Kirin Ichiban, some edamame, miso, and the assorted sashimi chef&#39;s choice. All the food was great. The atmosphere was nice as well. It was somewhat Japanese style where the booth-like tables provided some intimacy for your party while also having the introductory &#34;irasshaimase&#34; yelled from the kitchen when patrons entered. This place seemed like it could be poppin&#39; in the later evening hours. The music was good and I just got those vibes from being here. Granted I&#39;m not sure who would be out in this area that would want to get it &#34;poppin&#34; at a sushi place but whatever. I won&#39;t say poppin anymore. Poppin."

The waitress/manager was incredibly rude and condescending. Our orders took over 60 minutes to arrive the table and they screwed up two of those orders. The food is grossly overpriced for the quality or should I say lack of quality you&#39;re receiving. When I spoke to the manager I informed her that that our soups never came out with the meal.

There was also a cocktail selection, as well as sake and all the good Asian beers (Sapporo, asahi, Kirin, Kirin light) to choose from. The plaza that this restaurant is located in is otherwise empty, but sushi ai seems to be doing pretty well nonetheless! Our waiter didn&#39;t seem too knowledgeable about the beverages but was very friendly and accommodating. 

What we ordered (and were very pleased with):
Sashimi combo of 15 pieces- very fat and generous, however my brother did taste some frozen pieces..
Veggie maki
White sox
Ocean drive
California sunset
Rainbow
Sexy lady
Crazy dragon

Udon was also quite tasty, but you can&#39;t go wrong with this dish anyways so it was a nice way to fill the hungry boys up. The salad and miso soup with the sashimi combo were also good- though the salad was drenched, the dressing was still light tasting. 

Overall a nice suburban sushi find! Might be back soon."

The décor is cute, nothing too exciting except for that samurai to greet you! We sat in the booths by the bar and it had a bright blue lighting that defiantly drew you into the bar. 

We came on a weekday night so it was fairly slow and was able to get seated right away. Service was awesome, super friendly and helpful.  They have a wide variety of sushi options, I feel like you cant go wrong on any of them. 

A few standouts is the scary spider, and- gosh I wish I didn&#39;t forget the name of the rolls. I will have to update this with the roll names.

We went in last week for my sister&#39;s birthday - she wanted sushi, which I am so thankful for!  Our server was fantastic, and (almost) everything was on point. (more on that later.)

We ordered... well, we ordered A LOT.  Basically everything that did not include:
1. cream cheese (it doesn&#39;t belong in sushi, does it?
2. asparagus (my dad doesn&#39;t like it.)

So, there were probably 10 full sized rolls on the table, as well as the tuna rice appetizer, and we each got one of those bomb $4 house salads.

We also ordered some nigiri: salmon, tuna, and yellowtail for everyone, and a piece of salmon roe (ikura) for me, my fav, and what I always end my meal with.

All of the rolls were great.  Spicy where they should be, mild where they should be, and FLAVORFUL.  The nigiri was large slices of fish atop well wasabi&#39;d rice.  Everything was very well executed.

The house salad... what can I say about this that has not already been said?  First of all, for $4, its humongous.  It&#39;s topped with shredded carrot and beets, along with crispy sweet potato bits.  Add orange, grapefruit, and tomatoes, and top with that creamy decadent ginger dressing... not to mention the fact that you can EAT THE BOWL.  So good.  So so good.

The only thing that feel flat for me was the ikura.  Something just didn&#39;t taste right.  It wasn&#39;t the brine-y, salty delight it should have been.  Luckily, I had just taken a little nibble off the top before diving in, and decided I was going to pass on it.  Our server was completely understanding and removed it from the bill for us.

I don&#39;t live close to Sushi-Ai anymore, but I do live close to what I&#39;ve been told is one of their sister restaurants.  Can&#39;t wait to go back."

I brought my family here on a Sunday supplemented with a Groupon.
We were hesitant because of the proximity to where I live but with few good reviews, we relinquished our inhibition - a decision I swear I regretted.
After we order appetizer ( 4 set of special rolls ), our entree took close to an hour to arrive on our table. Worse, there were new arrivals who end up getting their entry ahead of us.
And the entree were mediocre at its best .
The kind and polite waitress ( a Filipina) apologized and admitted the kitchen is under staff. . . I then asked how they make the diners feel better in situations like these - so the waitress approached the manager but the manager didn&#39;t even apologize nor our party were given some consolation of some sort, didn&#39;t bother to come to our table.
So my conclusion is: THANK GOD FOR YELP. 
Off note , the location of the restaurant ( 70% of neighboring establishment it&#39;s either closed or went on bankrupt ) must be the factor of how other review came up with- no competition.
Or simply they were under staffed."

Don&#39;t let the location fool you. It&#39;s very easy to overlook it as it is in a weird plazza. It is not a big place but it&#39;s very cozy. Dark but not dark enough to make it look like a disco.

The miso soup and the seaweed salad both stood out as absolutely delicious! 
The Special Spicy Tuna roll was nice too.

California Sunset Roll could have been a lot better if they used all real crab meat instead of mixing it with imitation crab meat (what they call &#34;half and half&#34;). 

The scallops were a bit burned to my taste and they were only 2 of them!! But my brother liked it. It wasn&#39;t bad.

The sushi quality is good, I have had worse, but I have also had MUCH better - especially at this price point.  They had some imaginative rolls, but imagination doesn&#39;t always equate to good.  

For two people and a child (who only had grilled salmon at $10) we spent over $80 -- without alcoholic beverages and we still left feeling hungry.

I&#39;ve been here twice and both times almost missed it and thought it was closed because of the tiny store front squeezed between a tan salon and a vacant business. Also, both times dining here I used a groupon. I appreciate the creative display but I&#39;d rather not have the added expense attached to the food. The sashimi was nice and fresh, the rolls were good but not extraordinary, and the saki list tries to sway you toward expensive premiums instead of being balanced.

But as soon as I walked in I was flabbergasted. This restaurant is romantic as hell. There are probably 10 tables and although it&#39;s a small restaurant, the high-backed booths make it feel incredibly private. It&#39;s a great departure from the other sushi places in the area where you feel like you have to share your chair with whoever is dining next to you. 
Everyone who works here is super nice and great at reading the tables. Like, if you&#39;re ready to strike up a conversation, they&#39;ll hang out a little. If you&#39;re on a hot date, I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t linger at the table. Ah, I hope one day I get to go on a hot date here.
The food presentation is probably the most beautiful I&#39;ve seen from any restaurant. Last time I was here I had the house salad, which is served in a crispy wonton bowl on top of a nest of shredded beets. Like it looked like a little bird&#39;s nest. A delicious little bird&#39;s nest. Say nest again. We had the dragon fire which came out with a little flame on the plate. The green turtle roll comes complete with a little wasabi turtle head. And I think the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever seen on a plate was my sister&#39;s una-don entree, which is &#34;just&#34; eel over steamed rice. But it comes plated with all these beautiful garnishes and a candle and...sigh.
Aside from the food being beautiful, it&#39;s delicious. If you&#39;ve ever had black rice, you know it looks like cocoa crispies and tastes like heaven. I&#39;ve enjoyed everything I&#39;ve tried here, and I haven&#39;t found anything on the menu that I wouldn&#39;t try."

This waiter exceeded our expectations and was very natural and friendly and comedic in nature. Service was a little slow at the end when we decided to order a few more simple rolls, but nonetheless, our waiter was exceptional. We had their version of &#39;jalepeno poppers&#39; to start and they were quite tasty. We had an assortment of signature rolls which were all fantastic as well. Their food presentation is definitely one of the best I&#39;ve seen for sushi, especially for the &#39;green&#39; turtle, using a wad of wasbabi as the head. We had a Groupon, so that was helpful, especially since our total for 3 people came out to be around $135."

I came in on a Friday night, was immediately assisted, placing a takeout order for sashimi dinner $26.00. The staff were very personable, and made me laugh while waiting. Even after I leaned up against the glass vases behind the waiting bench (seriously though, who puts vases behind a backless seat?!)
I paid and the dinner came promptly, AND with soup and salad. Whatever they did to the Miso soup, it trumped every other miso soup experience I&#39;ve previously enjoyed. It was piping hot, but had a thick-heartiness to it, without noodles. 
The fish was fresh and the slices were cleanly cut and presented. So why 4 stars? The cost to quantity of sashimi was on the high side. I was a tad hungry still, even consuming all the decor they served the fresh slices on. That isn&#39;t what I was used to, when I previously spent a few dollars less, to get quite a bit more.
I will be back- it&#39;s not a huge cost difference, and proximity will prevail, plus that miso was memorable and the fish certainly was fresh.

Because without it, my meal would have cost 50$ for just one other person and I.  It was way too pricey for what it was.  We had the Golden Dragon, Red Dragon, Dragon, and Crunchy Muffy.  

The Golden Dragon was perfection.  I was in love.  It was so tasty and flavorful.  The citrus tobiko was also a daring, excellent choice!  My definite favorite.

The Red Dragon was also amazing with a nice smokey spicy flavor I have never had on sushi before.  A great thing to try!  I loved it.

The Crunchy Muffy I was not impressed with.  The cream cheese overpowered everything else in the roll.  I have sushi for the fish and combined flavor not a glob of cream cheese.  It was so strong I could barely finish the one bite.  

The dragon is something so typical and one of my favorites anywhere.  But here, I was so let down.  It was drenched in soy sauce to the EXTREME.  I couldn&#39;t taste anything but soy sauce.  I love soy sauce on sushi but this was too much.

Sushi-Ai needs to realize that sometimes a gentler taste is usually something to be desired in sushi.  Not too much of extra stuff.

Only Giving it three stars and not two due to the golden and red dragons being so good."

Doesn&#39;t look like much but when I entered, I was surprised. Not that everything is from Pier One but they def attempted to make it more classy. the main colors are black and red and its not too bright there, which I enjoy dimmer settings. 

Everyone was friendly. I sat at the sushi bar and Rachel was my waitress. She was newer but was very sweet and knowledgeable. Her other co-worker (blonde bigger guy with glasses) was very helpful as well. The sushi chef&#39;s were funny. The food was pretty good. Perfect balance of rice and fish on rolls. Not too much or too little of anything overall.

I work real estate and will def be back to bring my clients. Great job guys!

I had the regular seaweed salad, dragon fire roll, maguro (red tuna) nigiri, shrimpr fried rice to-go, and giant sake. My bill was $38-39. 

They are have mastered presentation, I would compare these guys to RA in Lombard (which is also a GREAT spot). These guys are a lil more mom and pop but have many choices. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see them expand!"

The service was desirable. The only problem was the price. Common rolls like California, Spicy Tuna, Philadelphia, Salmon Roll etc...($10 for a salmon &amp; avocado roll?) were about $3 more expensive than other sushi restaurants in the area. Granted they were good - the prices were surprising. Even the drinks - most glasses of wine are $9. As other reviewers have mentioned, this place is big on presentation. Perhaps that has something to do with the price. Each plate is beautifully constructed. Even my husband (who is not smart-phone or social media friendly) wanted to take a pic and post it to Instagram. We would come here again for the delicious sushi, but hopefully next time we can find a Groupon to help with the bill!"

The interior is sleek and modern with a sushi bar and several tables.  The sushi was amazing and exceeded my expectations.  The waiter mentioned his favorite roll was a rainbow roll which we tried and it was truly awesome.  The spicy tuna roll was the best I&#39;ve had with just the right about of heat.  We also tried the spicy octopus which was equally delicious. The sushi roll presentation was beautiful and I also like that they offer two different sizes on their rolls.  All the staff from the sushi chefs to the hostess and wait staff are super friendly.  This place is a definite hidden gem.

We ordered the jalapeno poppers (not sure if that&#39;s what they were called - I don&#39;t remember)... one of them was spicy, the other one was EXTREMELY spicy.

Inside, the place looked absolutely amazing. The place was semi-full, which is impressive for a suburban restaurant on a weeknight. They had little intimate booths and the standard tables. The two of us ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the Red Dragon roll, OceanWave roll, Green Frog Roll, and the Sexy Lady Roll. The food turned out awesome. The Green Frog Roll was shaped to look like a frog with a giant dab of wasabi for the head. It was great food!

BATHROOM REVIEW: For what great detail and thought to their food and decor, the bathrooms looked like was an afterthought. The bathrooms are located near the end of the restaurant, with curtains half-drawn to the bathroom room area. Inside the bathroom area, there two doors, men and women. Upon opening the door, you&#39;ll realize that this is a single-stall bathroom and it was super-small. One had to fully open door completely to enter as the stall was right at the door and would block your way. Inside, the bathroom was smelly and it was a toilet. It was one of the toilets with a small handle. So when I was done peeing, I couldn&#39;t do my customary kicking down of the toilet handle to flush. There were also poop splatters on the side of the toilet. SIT or SQUAT? SQUAT!

Single stall bathroom.  One toilet"

If you like paying more for the presentation than the quality, then the Groupon is the way to go! Don&#39;t get me wrong, I was very impressed by the presentation and attention to detail. I was let down by the quality/quantity. 

I had made a reservation as the Groupon suggested for a Friday night. We walked in right on time and had to wait to be seated. No big, we were still seated ahead of the line. It&#39;s cute and slightly modern, as I said - very detail oriented.

I started with miso soup and my friend had this cucumber/mint/ginger salad that was unique. It was fresh and zesty, I loved it. The miso soup was nothing to brag about, again the presentation was the best part. They serve the spoon on top filled with fried green onions. We had tried a few rolls that seemed out of our norm, but to be honest, they all kind of tasted the same. Shrimp with cucumber and tempura fluff, a little bland. The two rolls that stuck out the most to me were the Green Turtle (they made a little head out the blob of wasabi) and the Smoky-something or other with smoked salmon. The presentation was beautifully put together. 

The server was somewhat knowledgeable, but very polite and attentive.

We passed on dessert as everything seemed to settle a bit too quickly with me and I had to run. I think the only way I&#39;d come back is with another Groupon deal."

My husband and I got dinner from this place on a quiet weekday evening and the food blew us away. We got the pico de gallo roll which was spicy tuna topped with fresh pico de gallo- didn&#39;t think you could get 5 stars for that kind of a combination but it was sooo so good. And the fried rice was done so well- the vegetables were chopped to perfection, then stir fried. All in all, our experience went really well. A little too good to be true because I got a minor heart attack when I saw what they had charged us for a 2 entrees- $65!!! This is after buying their groupon bringing us to a whooping $86 for one roll and one order of fried rice. When I called to question the charges, the owner found that we had been wrongfully charged. I guess the server waited until the next day to charge us and he charged us for a &#39;to-go&#39; order that was worth $65 dollars. The owner literally just said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t do much besides giving you a discount the next time you&#39;re in&#34;. WE WERE CHARGED $60 IN ERROR  and the owner did NOTHING about it. In fact, the next day, I called with more proof from my bank and groupon and he refused to speak with me!!! And guess what?! We never even got the sorry little discount for our next meal that we had been offered for them charging us in error. I&#39;m sorry, sushi ai, your food was soooo good and I would&#39;ve loved to come back again and again but I don&#39;t want to get robbed another time.

Opted for a California roll, a tekka maki (my standard order at almost any sushi place) and a specialty roll of theirs, the Rainbow Dragon Roll.

I stuck with some &#34;basics&#34;, but let&#39;s use that phrase very loosely!  Nothing here is &#34;basic&#34;, and everything is amazing.  I am just saying that I wasn&#39;t feeling TOO adventurous at the time.  Next time, I know what to branch out to (but how am I ever going to veer from what I already know, love, and dream about at night?!).  Ahhh, first world problems.

Let me break it down:
**Mai Tai--served in a martini glass, and it is stroooooong.  It was the first thing I had when I got there, and it had me buzzing through the meal.  

Luckily, I sopped it up with:

**Stuffed Mushrooms--these are not your ordinary stuffed mushrooms, FO SHO.  They are stuffed with crab and deep fried.  They don&#39;t leave you with that horribly heavy feeling, either.  They come in a generous portion of four, and they&#39;re well worth the $$.  
 
**Veggie Fried Rice: By far some of the best fried rice I have ever had.  It&#39;s less expensive than the other fried rice selections, and my two other dining companions and I devoured it til we were full and still had some left.

&#34;Side&#34; salad--Don&#39;t let the *side* fool you, it&#39;s crap.  It is a meal in itself for the meager sum of $4.  Plus, it comes with this ginger dressing that I would bathe in given the chance.  Unfortunately this was a family place, and I couldn&#39;t do what I wanted to this sassy little dressing.

**California Roll--now, I didn&#39;t want to get crazy with my branching out, so I stuck with this for my &#34;meal&#34;.  Because I hadn&#39;t had enough already?!?! LOL  
But it was flavorful and delicious!  It was only $7.  Sushi can be expensive, but this was a roll that I could roll with (insert eye roll).

I will DEFINITELY be back to Sushi Ai.  It is eleventybillion kinds of amazing, and I can&#39;t wait for the next date with my ladies!"

I didn&#39;t realize that Sushi-Ai was a place I had been to a while back.....it is in a rather unremarkable strip mall, as so many sushi places are....on the very end next to a tanning salon. The inside is nice, a darker moody vibe but comfortable booths, a small sushi bar and then open seating in the middle. We didn&#39;t drink this trip, but they have a great wine and sake collection, FYI. Everything we ordered was divine, from the seaweed salad to the Kamakaze roll (my favorite of 2), the Crunchy Muffy (YUMMY!!!), the White Dragon and the Dragon Fest. We ordered one roll too many, alas but everything was just awesome and so artfully prepared, they take time to make each plate an artistic visually appealing masterpiece. Seriously.

My mom is a restaurant.com fan, so my family decided to come here and I am glad that we did. 

I ordered, unagi maki with avocado. I was totally expecting the 6 micro pieces that are about an inch high, half an inch in diameter. I wasn&#39;t expecting a beautiful caterpillar presentation. Then I thought... CRAP this roll is going to be 15 bucks now, but NOPE, 6 dollars. and it was so ridiculously fresh and tasted fantastic. Their edamame was salted a bit too much, but cooked well. I also ordered the scallop main entree dish. They tasted kind of rubbery and were very salty. The unagi still did it for me though. My parents got the sea bass entree and that was well done. My brother got the tempura udon and no complaints from him. 

it&#39;s great to know that when I am in the area, there is a great sushi place that I can come to and I don&#39;t have to go to the city.

The waiter was a huge turn off due to his smarmy attitude. Ordered one of the cool-sounding ice teas for $5 and sadly it turned out to be a bottle of Republic of Tea. We ordered several rolls and a half-entree, none of which came with miso, so I ordered it separately. The miso portion was tiny and arrived at the table room-temperature, blegh. The tofu in my entree was on the verge of being spoiled. The deluxe veggie roll was rather bland.

However, I love that you can get black rice in your rolls, and that they use apple for a garnish. May give this place another chance if we&#39;re in the area."

One of the servers sat us and she took away the drink menu. The host had to come over and give me one. I was waiting for my friend who arrived a couple minutes after I was seated. It being my first time there, I wanted to ask some questions about the most popular rolls and their sauces but the waitress left us sitting there for ten minutes without even taking our drink orders (it wasn&#39;t even busy). I don&#39;t mind waiting but when she finally came over, the two drinks I wanted were not available! They can simply cross them off the menus if they no longer keep it in stock. There was one other waitress working and all three of her tables that came in AFTER us got their food before we did since they didn&#39;t have to wait to place their orders. We finally got our food and it was delicious. She didn&#39;t clear the table after we finished and because we were in a hurry now from all the time in between being seated, ordering drinks, ordering our food and now ordering dessert; I wanted to get dessert and then leave. I had to stop the friendly host and ask for dessert menus. Again, when my friend was finished with her dessert, the waitress didn&#39;t clear the dishes, the host did. We had to ask for the bill, wait for it, immediately be ready to pay, and wait for the server again. I had a groupon for $40 so the $65 bill would be $25. My friend didn&#39;t even want to tip her because of her terribly slow service but because I know what it is like to live on tips, I decided 5 bucks would match her poor performance. Now, the waitress leaned in and COUNTED THE MONEY IN FRONT OF US. When she saw that we tipped her 5 dollars she pestered us saying that the tip should be 10% of the original bill not the &#34;discounted&#34; price. &#34;You are getting over 50% discount and you&#39;re only tipping 5 dollars. It should $6.50 from the original total&#34; she said that as if I got a groupon for free..? You might be thinking I am cheap but there are plenty of people who wouldn&#39;t have tipped her at all. How much I tip is an indicator of the server&#39;s performance. At the last sushi place I went to, I left a $13 dollar tip for food worth $25 because the service was excellent. At this point I had no time to argue with her so I was FORCED to leave her a $7 dollar tip that she and her attitude quite frankly did not deserve. Sushi Ai, your food is great but you do NOT force your customers to tip you more than they feel like especially after such bad service."

I actually started writing this review with four stars, but remembered that they are consistently in the 80s on their health inspection scores and that is slightly disconcerting, especially for a sushi place.  The restaurant is ALWAYS clean, and they actually just did a little remodeling to make it a little more up to date. But, obviously I&#39;ve never seen the kitchen so can&#39;t say why they can&#39;t get better inspection scores.

Anyway, despite their mediocre scores, I do enjoy their sushi.  I pretty much always get the Totoro Kani roll (king crab on the inside, spicy tuna on the outside) and the Millennium Maki (shrimp tempura, asparagus, etc. on the inside and eel on the outside). If I could make one suggestion to them it would be to make more lighter rolls - they don&#39;t always need tempura or mayonnaise.  They have been doing specials lately and they are usually on the lighter side and really refreshing. Keep it up!  They used to always be out of toro and uni, but seem to be keeping that more in stock too so I&#39;ve been really happy with that.

Is this the best sushi you will ever have? No. But if you are having a sushi craving meltdown, which my husband can tell you all about, this will definitely satisfy your taste buds and leave you pretty happy."

Unless you&#39;re with a large group of people, I recommend asking the hostess to seat you in the back towards the Sushi bar. There, it&#39;s less distracting and tolerable. Besides, you&#39;ll need the TV to help occupy your time. The service is SLOW!

The layout is contemporary and small. Unique woodwork dress the walls. The wine racks are in the middle of the room to entice you. The room is overcrowded with tables that are situated too close for comfort, leaving you with not a lot of room to scoot your seat back. For this reason, I prefer to sit in a booth. 

Tonight, we shared our plates, making it a well balanced Japanese surf and turf. To be sure Jason didn&#39;t leave hungry, he also had the $5 shumai (steamed shrimp dumplings) appetizer. Served with a spicy dipping sauce.

I ordered the grilled NY Strip medium rare, dressed with sweet soy sauce. For $18, it&#39;s served with sautéed vegetables and mashed potatoes. I would describe it as a grilled potato patty that tastes like the top part of a twice baked potato.

Jason ordered the U15 Golf Shrimp. For $19, it&#39;s served with seven-spice garlic butter with sautéed vegetable.I&#39;m not sure what the U15 represents but the dish is awesome!






Both orders included miso soup and house salad.

Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience because the food is worth the wait. Excellent presentation on the plate too!"

We have been loyal Sushi-Ai customers for several years, but the last time we went was a huge disappointment.
First of all, we ordered oysters on the half shell, which have always been one of our favorites as they are spicy and delicious. We ordered 4 and the waitress brought 2....in shot glasses....she then informed us that they no longer serve oysters on the half shell as people complained about shell pieces in the dish. If you can&#39;t properly shuck and oyster, then perhaps you shouldn&#39;t serve them?

Next we ordered 3 rolls, including the spicy tataki (again, one of our favorites). Unfortunately, the flavor was off...it didn&#39;t taste right at all. The other two rolls were very good, but completely fell apart when we tried to pick them up with chopsticks!! Isn&#39;t that kind of sushi 101? Making sure the rolls are rolled tightly?? It was a mess to eat. 
We also ordered a plate of sashimi and nigiri and it was very hit or miss. The salmon belly and super white tuna were excellent, but my slice of snapper was tough and chewy. In addition, we had ordered the sweet shrimp and the fried shrimp heads (which are my favorite part!) were not fried enough! They were chewy and inedible! 

To add insult to the injury of our evening, a couple arrived as we were eating and they apparently knew the sushi chef. They were extremely loud and obnoxious. The sushi chef sent over a HUGE plate of food for them...for FREE!!! Now I realize that chefs can comp food to whomever they choose, but what bothered me was the way it was handled. The couple were literally shouting across the dining room thanking the chef and making it obvious to everyone that their dinner was basically free!! Even the waitress looked embarrassed at the display. Of course at this time our huge bill arrived....yes, prices have definitely gone up at Sushi-Ai and being made to feel like we were subsidizing someone else&#39;s meal certainly did not help matters! 
Our server was good but I just can&#39;t ignore the flaws in quality and presentation of the food...especially for the price we paid. I really hope they get their act together again, but in the meantime, we are searching for a new go to sushi place."

The sushi menu is extensive and they are always featuring new rolls on their specials menu. I had the mango sunrise which was delicious and I hope they ad it to their menu permanently. The ocean drive is one of my favorites, white and red tuna with green peppers, lime juice and wrapped in rice paper. They have great martinis and a pretty good wine selection. I always start off with the house salad, it comes in a wonton bowl with ginger miso dressing and shaved sweet potato crisps for $4. You also have the option of getting the rolls in long or short which allows you to try a few different ones. The staff is very friendly and I have never had a bad experience in the 2 years I have been going there. I wish they offered outdoor seating but thats difficult to do in a strip mall setting."

We were a party of 4 with 3 adults and 1 child.  My nieces like sushi and rolls so this is our meal we do together which is fun.  They always want to go to sushi station which isn&#39;t my top pick so I got a groupon so we decided to try this out.  We were seated promptly and ordered edamame, shrimp shumai, miso soup and 3 salads which were all good but the salad was outstanding and loved the dressing. For dinner we had a chicken teriyaki dish for the 6 year old which came with some amazing stir fried vegetables. We ordered the smokey bear roll, shrimp tempura toll and California roll which were beautifully displayed.  My favorite roll was the smokey bear which is smoked salmon. Overall everything was very good.  Thankful we had a groupon because the prices were a little higher than expected.  I would return in a heartbeat!"

We usually stop by here when we&#39;re in the area (not often enough).  It is a little bit pricier compared to other sushi places but it tastes better and fresher so it&#39;s worth it.  The atmosphere is modern and the food presentation is the best.  

The only complaint I have is the blonde female waitress.  We don&#39;t get her much but when we do it&#39;s...well, let&#39;s just say that I walk out with a sour taste in my mouth.  I just don&#39;t like her.  She seems very desperate to prove to us that she&#39;s too cool for her job.  The other waiters are attentive, friendly, and engaging.  Perhaps it&#39;s because she seems to be one of the few female waitresses...maybe she has &#34;princess syndrome&#34; (can you say delusional?).  Anyway, I would just like my food and drink...please check your attitude at the door and don&#39;t bring it to my table.  I can literally hear her huffing and complaining about all the work she has to do when she thinks she&#39;s out of earshot.  Wow, sorry if your customers are a burden to you.  

Everything else is excellent.  It&#39;s a small place so it is easy to miss but definitely give it a try"

Despite the fact their &#34;sister&#34; restaurant, Blufish, is a mere five minute drive from my house, it really was worth driving an extra 20 minutes to Sushi-Ai.  We were warmly greeted and immediately seated! Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  I was happy to learn that, yes, they HAD O-Toro that evening.  Many other restaurants list it on their menu, but many times it&#39;s unavailable.  

Here, the O-Toro was fresh, tender, and delicious.  Our waiter suggested one of the evening&#39;s special appetizers...an oyster appetizer with ponzu and wasabi.  It was EXCELLENT!  We also shared some chicken kushi yaki and agadashi tofu. Mrs. ordered a sushi platter and was pleased with the variety and freshness of the tuna and salmon. I ordered the Sunset Drive Roll and the Special Spicy Tuna Roll...both were EXCELLENT!  

What really stands out here, and at Blufish, is the presentation of the dishes.  The chefs really make the plates beautiful with the unique way they carve an apple and fan it out on the plate.  And each plate is also adorned with a small candle.  It&#39;s really cool that the chefs take the time to not only make the food delicious, but present it so beautifully as well. It shows they are sticklers for quality and aesthetic. I wish I had taken pictures of the plates.  Check out the other photos on the review page...you&#39;ll see what I mean!

The woman who I presume was the manager of the restaurant, stopped by our table on several occasions to chat and check on how we were enjoying our meal.  She was very nice and was happy to know we&#39;ve dined at Blufish and even happier to know we drove the extra distance to visit Sushi-Ai!

No matter where you are in the Chicago area, or even if you&#39;re from out of town, if you are craving sushi, then Sushi-Ai is a definite must try.  You&#39;ll love the atmosphere, the service, and fresh, creative, and beautiful way they serve sushi here."

I have dined here many many times and have never been disappointed.  Typically I always get the Sake (Salmon) don.  Unbelievably gorgeous and super tasty plate. You almost do not want to eat it as it is just SO pretty. 

Today I had the Panko Scallops appetizer and WOW. Nuff said.

The atmosphere is just perfect and the Wait staff are very attentive.

One more side note.  I am not a fan of Uni. However, my friend and Wife both have had very positive comments on the Uni as not every place has fresh Uni.  Sushi Ai does. KUDOS!!!!

It&#39;s only about 5-10 minutes from Woodfield, so should you get that desire for sushi after shopping, the drive is very reasonable.

As another reviewer previously stated, the place looks closed when you drive into the lot. I had almost left until I decided to walk up and check anyways; luckily it was open.

The service was very good right from the start. Two women welcomed me and my friend and we were seated immediately. They gave suggestions and answered every question/request we had very timely and accurately (YES!).

For an appetizer we had the asparagus beef roll. It came with about 8-10 pieces, each piece being a cut of asparagus wrapped in tender beef and dressed with a teriyaki (I believe?) sauce. It was freshly made, warm, and tasted delicious. You can&#39;t go wrong with the asparagus + beef combination.

They have a full page with the traditional maki rolls, and TWO PAGES full of signature rolls! I was loving the variety to choose from. Each roll can be ordered &#34;short&#34;, which is 5 pieces, or &#34;long&#34; which is 10 pieces.

We ordered multiple rolls: crunchy muffy, dragon fest, golden dragon, dirty old man, and the shrimp tempura.

Unfortunately I&#39;m unable to find an online menu to give you full descriptions of each roll, nor can I recall the exact contents of each, but I CAN promise you that every roll was amazing. The ingredients were all fresh and the individual rolls were generously sized. The presentation was nice, as you would expect with any respectable sushi restaurant. They had freshly sliced apple, ginger, and wasabi with every plate. Very nicely put together overall.

I also ordered a bottle of hot sake which I polished off myself (go me!) that was delicious.

The prices were very reasonable, for an appetizer, five rolls, and a bottle of sake, the bill was under $60!

With the great food, splendid service, variety menu, and very reasonable prices, I will most likely be returning here soon (and I promise to note descriptions!)."

The restaurant is unfortunate to be in a strip mall and to have an empty adjacent space that appears to be under the Sushi-Ai sign.   You can&#39;t see the restaurant door well until you walk right up to it. 

This place rocks, though!  I am a big sushi fan and this small place has one of the most diverse menus with some of the cleverest maki combinations that I&#39;ve ever seen.  Try the Ocean Drive Roll it is superb.  They also stand out because of their amazing and complex plating style.  If you order the Flight of Tuna appetizer, you kind of expect a bunch of tuna layered on a plate with a lump of wasabbi next to it.  Right?  Wrong.  These 6 pieces of Sashimi were plated on a boat of ice (that&#39;s ice not rice), filled with red beet &#34;noodles&#34;, a complex cucumber statue, and an origami bird made out of carrot.  I guess they only have 2 of these ice boats per day so we were lucky to get it, but all their plates are like a work of art.

Take that date here you want to impress.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a romantic feel to it.  The service is also excellent."

Food was good, the waitstaff was helpful in offering suggestions, &amp; the atmosphere was fine.  We has 3 rolls: Ocean Drive, King Kong (not listed on the menu), &amp;  Salmon Supreme (I think that&#39;s the name). We would both rank them in that order. 

For us, since there are quite a few sushi places in the NW burbs, our ultimate recommendation is based on whether or not we&#39;d come back a 2nd time. &amp; try different rolls. We&#39;d come back (but only with a Groupon - with so many Groupons for sushi places it would be silly to try a place w/o one)."

Sushi Ai is some of the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had. This is coming from a seasoned sushi eater who has eaten at some of the best sushi joints in LA, Vegas, Chicago and New York. Is it a bit pricey? Sure, but sushi tends to be a bit on the pricier side, so deal with it. 

Not only is the service spectacular (even though I&#39;m an out of towner, they treat me and my family like, well, family) but the creativity and presentation displayed through the food is out of this world. I positively crave this sushi every time I head back to my folks&#39; house! Some of my favorite rolls...and these are just a few...

Ocean Drive: Tuna, cilantro, jalapeno, rice paper that makes for a delicious fresh combo that I salivate for. Super, super fresh. 

Crispy Spicy Tuna OR Salmon: Oh deliciousness. Spicy chopped up tuna or salmon atop a grilled, square patty of rice with some delightfully tasty sauce. I&#39;m not even a salmon fan and I adored the spicy salmon. 

Special Spicy Tuna: Asparagus, tuna, rice paper and some delectable spicy mayo combo lightly drizzled on top. It&#39;s a warm roll but I plow through it every time. 

Tornado Sunrise: Spicy lobster rolled with black and white rice. Oh momma is that spicy. 

They are happy to make substitutions to your liking - spice level, wrapper type, white or black rice, etc. Also, because the sushi chefs here are so talented, and I&#39;ve witnessed many new creations coming out of the sushi bar on a regular basis. While you&#39;ll walk out of here with less in your pocket, Sushi Ai serves up some slammin&#39; sushi that will leave you comin&#39; back for more."

I ordered a cheesy chicken burrito plate (today&#39;s special with no description) and went and sat down.

I took a look at my receipt and was disgusted I was charged 10 cents for water! If you are going to charge for water then let me buy a bottle of water instead or give me that option. Heck tell me you&#39;re charging me for a cup! At the prices they are charging for the food a plastic cup of water shouldn&#39;t be something that they have to watch cost on. I then went to fill my cup up and the soda fountain had a raunchy smell as I looked closer I&#39;m not sure they washed it in some time. I&#39;m glad the water was in a cooler back by the pickup counter. I&#39;m not sure I would have taken water out of the soda fountain.

Now the food comes and it was Epic. When I order a burrito from a Mexican establishment I would usually expect some lettuce, maybe tomato. Neither of those could be found in the off color white liquid that poured out with pinto beans and perfectly cubed chicken that tasted like it came from a can. The burrito was disgusting, I wouldn&#39;t even feed it to my dog. The cheese was so gross! At this point I was thankful i ordered a plate because I thought at least I can fill up on the beans and rice. I was painfully mistaken, the beans had no flavor and the rice was dry and overcooked. I went ahead and thought I would at least add a bit of salt to the beans to give them some flavor but as I reached for the salt shaker it was loaded with grimy crud from the previous occupants. No way was I touching such a disgusting ornament on my table. I&#39;d have to sanitize for sure after touching it. So I choked down my food so that I don&#39;t get hungry later.

I&#39;m warning all future guests of the establishment to take the trip across the parking lot next door and enjoy Buona Beef instead. You will be thankful that I gave you that tip. Anything will be better at Buona Beef. There isn&#39;t one good quality to Besa Mi Taco, not even the salsa bar people claim to like."

1- Ordered a platter and they only gave me a burrito but still charged me. Thank God I lived closer so I went back. 
2- I ordered to sit down and eat there instead they gave me a TO GO Box with no napkins, no silverware.

All things considered it does have inexpensive tasty food. I only give it 3 stars because it&#39;s definitely a step up from Chipotle but not anything like La Hacienda or a high end authentic Mexican restaurant. Food is served on plastic plates &amp; utensils. The chips aren&#39;t seasoned but the salsa bar makes up for that. The steak fajitas are ok. Nothing special. Steak mixed with A LOT of onions &amp; peppers.

The food is pretty good, I usually order their steak taco salad, of a light crispy taco shell with tons of chopped Romain lettuce, shredded cheese, black olives, and red onions topped with grilled steak, slices of avocado, and sour cream. You can also have salad dressing but I tend to opt that out. 
I also had their corn or flour tacos, and their combo meal of their cheesy enchiladas with ground chicken, ground beef or cheese that comes with rice and refried beans. 
I don&#39;t care much of their serving plates which are thin black plastic plates with plastic utensils. If you asked for water they do have two types of watering dispensers, one is plain with ice the other is with slices of limes and lemons. Drinks are your typical soda or you could actually have a frozen margarita or beer. 
There is a fresh salsa bar that you can get as much mild or spicy salsa as you&#39;d like. It&#39;s great with their warm crispy chips sold separately. Their guacamole is pretty good as well.
The food is somewhat authentic but the price can be a little steep for the amount of food you get. It&#39;s not your typical divey Mexican restaurant. To order your meal you would go up to the counter and they would call out your number. This place also takes &#34;Belly&#34; accounts if you have one to build up food points for free food:) 
Inside has plenty of seating whether you want to sit in a booth or grab a table and put them together for a bigger party. They also have outdoor seating as well.
Overall I like this place it&#39;s clean and the staff is friendly and the food is pretty good I would come back here again."

I haven&#39;t been to this place in a few years, and thought I&#39;d give it another try. I wasn&#39;t that impressed when I visited before so....

I got the impression not a lot had changed right away. Walking to the counter I overheard a snippet of a conversation between a worker and an older couple. The we&#39;re complaining about something, and the worker dude suggested getting the manager...never a good sign. 

I ordered the Gringo Pollo Burrito. It was big enough, but the first bite told me it should have been named Salty Chicken Burrito. 
It had tons of sour cream. And was pretty bland. It was supposed to have some special red sauce, but I couldn&#39;t find any. 

And where was the salsa?  Ok, this one would be my fault. There is a small table with salsas on it. Duh. It&#39;s at the salsa bar.  Once found, I took a few small paper cups at dipped out a few samples.  The mild was really mild, and the hot was pretty hot.  But my main complaint about this &#34;fresh salsa&#34; is that it was puréed beyond recognition. I guess it just didn&#39;t look fresh, and certainly didn&#39;t taste as fresh as it should. 

And this gringo likes guacamole in his burritos. Was that an option because I missed that too if it was. 

Sorry to say not much has changed. Sign on the door says they are looking for cooks and waitresses. I guess that should have been an indicator also."

I don&#39;t know how we&#39;re expected to eat this when the bowl gets broken and eaten, so where will all the insides go after that? And then also, I don&#39;t want to keep digging to the bottom to get the lettuce, I want to have most of the ingredients mixed into one bite if possible. I dunno, someone&#39;s got to think of something different for this...

My boo ordered the torta plate, which basically comes with rice and beans on the side of the torta. It&#39;s not the best torta I&#39;ve had, but it was pretty good.

I had been visiting way too often over the past year and a half. Tacos, chips and salsa. I&#39;d change up the tacos, but that was about it. A few things I don&#39;t like...they take far too long at the drive thru, they only have one size drink which isn&#39;t enough when eating salty chips and spicy salsa and I&#39;m no longer a fan of their staff. Here&#39;s why...

There is a man who is usually in a dress shirt and dress pants. I thought he was the manager, now I&#39;m not so sure. Basically, as I wait at the drive up window, he&#39;s always touching the girls. I was going to find someone to complain to, but I thought he was the manager. Inappropriate much?  I felt uncomfortable and no one was touching me. 

So last week while waiting at the drive thru (for way too long), I watched a girl literally pick her skin/cuticles/nail polish off her fingers and flick it away. We made eye contact. She looked away and kept doing it. I was so disgusted. This is the area where the food is packed up. I don&#39;t want finger skin particles in my lunch, thanks. So I ask for the manager. I&#39;m waiting for the touchy guy to show up and instead a woman who I&#39;ve never seen before comes to the window. I tell her about the picker girl and before I&#39;m even done, the manager acknowledges that this is a known issue with this girl. Really?!?!  I point out how awful this is and ultimately unacceptable. The manager tells me that she checks the girls fingers for cleanliness every day. Huh???  Annoyed and disgusted, I leave. 

And I won&#39;t be back. Yuck. Where&#39;s Robert Irvine when you need him?  Actually, they don&#39;t deserve Robert because they know all about their disgusting issue and don&#39;t care to fix it."

Only issue I have had was when my group at work ordered a tray of Flautas for a work lunch event. We called to get a little better deal and after a few calls we got it. However when we went to pick it up, we were denied any sauce. We had to wait for the manager to come out and tell us it was not part of the deal. We spent 52 bucks on a single tray and they would not even give us any sauce. After we complained the manager gave us 2 little single person sauce trays.

We tossed around a few regular places and one of the women suggested &#34;that Mexican place near Arlington Heights Rd and Devon&#34;. I knew exactly what she was talking about: Besa Mi Taco!! My sister goes there regularly and loves it. Let&#39;s try it. One of the ladies I work with immediately said she has been there and it NOT a fan. I could not figure out why knowing how much my sis frequents it, so we ended up ordered from here just the two of us to give it a shot.

Sure enough, I loved it. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a taco al pastor and loved every bite. The chicken they used for the quesadilla was grilled white meat chicken breast cubed up. Flour or corn tortillas- your choice.  My one and only complaint for take-out is they put lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and guacamole in the same container as the quesadilla and sadly, the lettuce and tomatoes being water-based veggies, can make the tortilla a bit on the soggy side, but if this is my only complaint...we found a winner!  

I have since returned a few times, once more doing take-out via the drive thru which is really not their forte. The drive thru should only really be for pick up orders. They do not cook fast enough to have you place an order and get it at the window. I think I was in the drive thru for at least 10-15 minutes. 

The most recent visits have been to dine in and dining in is typically pretty good. Fountain drinks so you can refill before you hit the road. Clean dining room and a salsa bar! Who doesn&#39;t like that. All you can eat Salsa.  The taco al pastor was sadly, a little cold. The meat is obviously pre-made and that&#39;s fine, but they needed to heat it a little more before serving. I didn&#39;t complain because of the time crunch, but next time, I will be sure to point out that my last taco was not very hot. The quesadilla seems to be my go-to dish here and even by itself, is enough to make a meal off of. I have no complaints about the potions at all. They put plenty of meat in their tacos. Always a plus for a Mexican place.

Def one of my go-to Mexican joints for lunch!"

But, today I was craving a Burrito and didn&#39;t want to drive anywhere.  Besa Mi Taco is in the same lot that the building I work in is located, so I decided to give them another try.  This time, I simply went there to order Steak Burrito to take back to the office.

It was around 1PM and there were not too many patrons.  The restaurant has the look and feel of a chain Mexican/Tex Mex place.  They have a fairly typical menu consisting of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tortas, and tamales.  They also offer food for &#34;gringos&#34; and salads.

I seem to recall that the last time I was here I ordered tacos, thinking they would be the best since they are in the name of the restaurant.  Since I ordered a burrito, I can&#39;t say whether or not they were better than last time.  However, the burrito was not bad. There was a healthy portion of steak, tender and tasty.  The beans were good, and the lettuce and tomato were fresh.  One thing I do recall I liked last time were their salsas.  I had the spicy red salsa today and it was very good.  They grilled the burrito, a touch that I like.  But, the tortilla itself was a little doughy.  Overall, the burrito was not the best I&#39;ve ever had, buut it was far from the worst.  All in all, not too bad.

The servers were pleasant and helpful.  The place itself looked clean.

One thing that sets them apart from other &#34;fast food&#34; tex-mex restaurants is they offer Frozen Margaritas in several flavors.  Too bad this was lunch in the middle of the workday.  They look pretty good.  I may have to go back there after work is done for the day."

But what I really travel sometimes an hour for is their salsa verde picante. I am obsessed with how good it is. I have tried to make it at home and failed several times. It is a wonderful mix of tangy, spicy, savory goodness. I put it on everything.  I wish they sold it by the bottle, I would stock up.

I usually get the taco platter which comes with 2 tacos (of the larger sized variety,) rice and refried beans. The beans are quite tasty, but the rice is forgettable. If you are a big eater, add an extra taco. Ask for the tacos to be kept separate from the beans and rice. If you dont, they put the tacos on top of the beans and it causes the corn shells to soak up the moisture and they will break apart and cause a big mess.

They have other salsas and peppers available at the salsa bar, but I love the verde so much, I never take the other one.

They are always very nice to me and very polite. I think it is a family run business owned by people who have other more formal mexican restaurants in the area. 

If you do it right, you walk out of there with your fingers smelling like corn masa until you wash them.  I love it!"

The service is continually getting worse - most recently I stopped by on a Saturday evening when they weren&#39;t busy and tried the drive thru. Well, I waited about 5 minutes before anyone came to the speaker, then the guy says &#34;give me a minute&#34;. I had half a mind to just leave and probably should have. It took a few more minutes until he took my order and when I went to pay he disappeared. 5 minutes later someone different came to the window and asked me if I paid. I nearly flipped because I had the charge receipt and clipboard in my hand and my receipt was still sitting on the register. When I told her I paid, she stared at me. It took another 5 minutes for my food and then she forgot the drink. Then I get the drink and the top pops off the second I get it in the car and spills in my car. The food was terrible when I finally got to eat it so I ended up throwing most of it out.

In total, $11 in the garbage and 20 minutes of bs trying to use their drive thru. Then another 10 minutes cleaning lemonade from my car. Needless to say I&#39;m not going back. There is better customer service at the DMV..."

I have to up my rating because it&#39;s stayed consistent through the years. The taco shell is always fresh and never greasy. They don&#39;t skimp on the fixins, it&#39;s prepared quickly, and it&#39;s a semi-healthy lunch for only 6 bucks. Plus it&#39;s the closest place to where I work. 

I still would not eat anything else at Besa Mi Taco as I am not a fan of bland, faux Mexican.

Place was dead and I put my bike next to a vacant table (only 2 other patrons in the whole place) ordered my food and sat down when this manager came up and she  told me to move my bike out.  I told her that there was no rack or any place to put it and asked if I could just keep it next to me for this time she said no as it is a restaurant and to move it.   I complied and went outside (50 degrees it was) since my bike cost me over $ 1,500 and ate outside - as alone my bike was not going to be.

She was such a snot nosed witch with no people skills that I will never go there again, it ruined my lunch and just made me so angry - and all for going out to lunch at her shop!"

 I stick with the tacos while i&#39;m there and they&#39;re impressive.  The is not bland, pre-made from a bag.  I think they grind it fresh themselves.  The horchata isnt&#39; too sweet. 

The dining room is always packed during lunch, dinner is a better time to go. They close at 9p which i find a hard to make at times.

They have a drive through but it&#39;s pointless.  They make the food from scratch and it takes a good 5-10 minutes for the food to come out, be prepared for a wait in your car.  For good food, i don&#39;t mind the wait.

Wow this is quite possibly the most foul disgusting crap I have EVER had.

We came across besa mi taco BIG MISTAKE. At first we were happy when we saw the prices weren&#39;t so bad.... Then we got our food....... I&#39;ve had better frozen dinners except that I suspect that it might have been one of those $1 banquet frozen dinners. I had the chicken enchilada plate. The sauce had a funky taste, the cheese I&#39;m pretty sure was American melted on top, there was maybe  a quarter of a chicken breast cut up in TWO ENCHILADAS (probably cause they were about 2 inches long). The rice and beans were boring but I wish I had more than the three bites of each they gave me to give it a chance! I ordered a margarita which was pitiful! We also ordered nachos that were supposed to have all this stuff on them soooo they came in a metal takeout container and in it was a handful of crushed up chips covered in a hard layer of that same crusty American cheese with a glob of sour cream and a glob of guacamole. Impossible to eat. Not to mention the fact the guy taking the orders with the overdone brows was soooooo rude. They don&#39;t have napkins anywhere in the restaurant you have to ask, so you would think ol Mr. Friendly would be used to being asked for them but NOOOO he gave me an attitude, rolled his eyes, and gave me 4 napkins for the table of EIGHT!!!

I ordered the Chicken Burrito Suizo with a cup of water. I was informed that even though I was ordering a $6 burrito, I would still have to pay an additional $ .29 for the cup of water. I asked to speak to the manager and told him that since I was buying food, I didn&#39;t understand why I had to pay for water. He stated, &#34; I have to pay for the container.&#34; First, it doesn&#39;t cost $ .29 for a cup, and second, I was a paying customer, not someone off the street just asking for water. 

   In addition, when I got to the burrito, I saw that I had only been given a flimsy, unwrapped plastic fork with no knife. It was almost impossible to eat the flour tortilla, smothered in red sauce without a knife. I had to pick up the entire burrito with the fork, take a bite, and put the whole thing back down again. It was a mess and the two tiny napkins they gave me did not help. 

   The burrito itself was ok but a lot of restaurants have burritos that are ok, None of them charge for water and all of them give the proper utensils needed. I understand that restaurants have to cut costs to stay competitive, but not at the expense of customer service. 

   Next time, I&#39;ll just take my business somewhere else that knows how to take care of its customers. For them, it was a unnecessary loss of a customer."

This restaurant is owed by the same family that started the local La Magdalena and La Hacienda restaurants. I am big fan of these larger establishments, and have had great experiences, but this Fernandez location falls very short on flavor. 

The decor is quite fantastic, and I would have to say the chicken soup is the only reason I come back. The major fallback seems to be the meat quality. I don&#39;t know if it is poorly seasoned, or just poor quality, or maybe they precook the steak, but I have been disappointed with the steak every time. I typically have a burrito or torta, and it&#39;s a very good thing they drown the burrito in sour cream for you. I would say today will be my last trip to Besa Mi Taco for a very a long time. 

It was a ghost town while I was there, and I was there at dinner time (6:30 to 7:30) on a Tuesday, when it should have been at it&#39;s busiest. It seems the community has caught on to the poor quality. 

Another minor draw back is that no one seems to be happy to be working here. I catch some sort of attitude every time from whoever is behind the counter. The kitchen seemed to think it was all right to sing and be loud and obnoxious since there was no customers in the restaurant at the time. 

Do yourself a favor and grab a burrito from El Burrito Tapatio in Addison. Great steak quality, chips and salsa on the table for free, and they are open until 2:00AM every day."

The room looked festive but there is a picture of a woman trying to look sexy while eating a chip- that ruined the decor of the place.  And what the heck-  the female staff looked like they wore clothes made or a roller rink- I don&#39;t know if they were trying to copy Hooters idea of dressing their servers or what?  It did NOT fit the place. 

Overall- this place was a big disappointment."

You can go to a real Mexican restaurant and probably get more for your money. This place is just a rip off.

LoL!  (Which almost made me change my mind might I add....)......

So I ordered a taco platter which was just okay.....it was pretty bland as mentioned in other reviews. I would say the best part of the meal was the frozen margarita I had, and the &#34;salsa&#34;bar.....the salsa was very good.

Definitely not like Baja Fresh (as Nicole L. mentioned).....Baja Fresh has food that actually tastes YUMMY!!!   :)

Needless to say, I will not be going back here if I&#39;m looking to eat Mexican food."

I went in for lunch the other day because I was in a hurry, even though I had this feeling that it was a bad idea. I got up to the counter and was greeted by a terse, &#34;Are you ready?&#34; while I was reading the menu.

I ordered a chicken burrito figuring it would be a decent starting option and would be somewhat quick. 25 minutes later, I have a chicken burrito. They came very close to having me demand my money back.

I bit into my burrito and tasted beans. Then i tasted more beans. Then I took a bite of chicken that might as well have been shoelaces. I don&#39;t know how you get chicken that dry, but somehow they did. The entire burrito tasted like nothing besides beans and cheap tortilla. If I had any other option at the time, I would&#39;ve just thrown the rest out.

I usually go back to a restaurant at least twice before I cast judgment, just in case i had a fluke bad experience, but I can&#39;t see my self ever wasting money at this place again. I&#39;ve had better, more flavorful Mexican at Taco Bell."
besa-mi-taco-itasca,Johnny X.,qAdJeR7Z8noK27NsOg7cvw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,45,33,VRTibtHULwXbu5JHvvWsDw,1.0,2008-05-01,"I must first start off by stating that i am thoroughly impressed by Besa Mi Taco&#39;s ability to screw up every single possible aspect of the fast food dining experience. I mean, seriously; you have to TRY to get zeroes across the board. And yet, there it is. I have given this place FOUR chances to do what they claim to do, and have only been able to not absolutely piss me off only ONE of those times. Even then, I wasn&#39;t even satisfied; I was just not pissed off.

All four times, I went around lunch hour (11:30 - 1ish). I understand that the place is surrounded by office buildings, and is going to get a lot of traffic. The problem is, THEY don&#39;t understand it, even though they&#39;ve been open since 2004. I have seen the line regularly reach the doorway of the place and snake around, several times during the course of my meals, and this doorway is a good 40-50 feet from the registers. And how many registers do they need to handle a REGULAR clientele that size? Well, they think 2 should be enough. It&#39;s not like they just don&#39;t have the staffing, its that they just don&#39;t have the physical registers. That&#39;s right - all these years of long lines and waiting customers, and they never sprung for a single additional register. I&#39;ve also been stuck at the end of that line, and timed 12 minutes on one particular visit (yeah, I&#39;m that guy. I&#39;m in a line doing nothing, and I have a watch). i stayed because I don&#39;t have any set time limit on my lunch break, but I bet a lot of these other people do, and I am astounded by the level of patience they have. 

The place is also very open, and thus, noisy and echo-y. To really drive this fact home and make you appreciate it, they put the shortest, meekest girls they can find at the registers, so you have to literally lean over the register and get right in their face just to hear what they&#39;re saying. Even though I&#39;m the third guy in line I watched do this, they still give me this dirty look like I&#39;m doing something totally bizarre and unacceptable.

Today, I ordered four steak tacos. I did not give them any kind of custom order. 4 steak tacos and a large pop. That&#39;s it. I stood at the pickup area until they got an order number that was TWENTY ahead of mine. I understand that certain foods take time, like baked apple pancakes or a deep-dish pizza, but I had ordered the most basic of all Mexican food groups. And its not like they had to cook more steak or something, I saw plenty of steak dishes whizzing past me. I asked the girl if she had an ETA on  #96. I had to repeat this twice, and then yelled it at her the third time. I got that nice dirty look that they apparently train their employees to give again. She walked away, then came back and started handing out peoples orders again. She didn&#39;t even look at me. 5 minutes later, she asks what my order number was. I hand her my ticket, but by that point, someone was carrying it over. She slid it across the counter to me, both without apologizing, nor without making eye contact or even smiling.

Now on to the food:

I have gotten four dishes there: Tacos, a torta, a burrito, and a couple of enchiladas. All four of these taste EXACTLY THE SAME. I&#39;m not even exaggerating. It&#39;s honestly astounding that they manage this. It wasn&#39;t until today that I finally realized how this can possibly be: ALL THE FOOD IS BLAND AS HECK. Seriously. I took a BIG bite out of my first taco at lunch, and you know what I thought? &#34;WOW. This is a really flavorful tortilla.&#34; Yeah, the tortilla. I immediately realized that ALL I could taste is the tortilla. You know you&#39;re in trouble when the most flavorful part of your food is the part that is SUPPOSED to be bland.  So, I inspected.

I had my tortilla there, yes. There was a decent helping of tomatoes in there, a bunch of lettuce, a TON of cheese, and a decent amount of steak. So, its not that they just skimped on anything, the food really was this bland! I was honestly legitimately intrigued. I couldn&#39;t believe it. i forekd out a few pieces of steak and popped them in my mouth. They tasted like nothing, like water, or air or plain jello. It was downright bizarre. The texture was horrible, too: it was like a very dry pork. I even thought it might ACTUALLY be pork, and then realized that they don&#39;t serve pork there. It was bad times. I got through about a taco and a half, and couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I brought it back to the counter, explained my situation, and told them I&#39;m going to need my money back. The manager offered to cook me a fresh dish, but I explained to him that the way they cook their food IS the problem, so his idea wouldn&#39;t help. he did give me my money back without much hassle, which was indeed pleasant. The amount I paid was in excess of $10, which is also EGREGIOUS for four tacos and a pop. that&#39;s like $2 each for four servings of cardboard in a tasty tortilla.

Finally, what&#39;s with the name? Veiled sexual reference, anyone? They&#39;ve even got lips on the sign. Gross."

(I am also enlightened with the way you managed to turn the word &#39;echo&#39; into an adjective.) It makes no sense why you went back to this place after the second time of receiving such horrific service.

I have to say Besa Mi Taco is a great place to get tasty food fast.  Unlike Qdoba and Baja, Besa Mi Taco uses real cheese to melt on their dishes.  Their nachos literally melt in your mouth with a delicious combination of beans, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and your choice of meat.  Because my boyfriend is a vegetarian, we both also appreciated the variety of vegetarian dishes that they offer.  The vegetables found in their veggie burritos and veggie quesadillas are undoubtedly always fresh and grilled to perfection. I also appreciate the option of choosing my meal to be on flour or corn tortilla.  Their noon time rush is no different than the noon time rush at its neighboring restaurant. With great food there comes a great amount of people.  Though I too have first handedly seen customers impatiently wait for their food, I have also taken note of the fast paced workers behind the counter.  It&#39;s clear that they&#39;re trying to get the food out as fast as they can.

The atmosphere of Besa Mi Taco is very enjoyable as well.  Their satellite radio station plays everything from Spanish rock to catchy salsa.  As for putting the &#39;shortest, meekest girls they can find at the registers,&#39; I do not understand what height has to do with the service of the girls.  I&#39;ve encountered nothing but sweetness and manners from each and every of their workers.  These waitresses always take my picky orders with a smile on their faces.  I have not once encountered this so called &#39;dirty&#39; look.  It makes me wonder what could possibly provoke such sweet girls to exhibit such a look.  Furthermore,  there is an always pleasant busboy saving you the trouble from tossing away your garbage.  

If you&#39;re in an absolute hurry and can&#39;t step down for some food, the service at drive-thru is extraordinary.  Not once has the adorable girl in drive-thru forgot to ask me what kind of salsa I would like with my meal.  I&#39;ve always driven away with plenty of napkins, salsa, and food.  I have seen this girl fill my pop while taking another person&#39;s order and handing me my change all at once.  Great service is never a question for this outstanding restaurant.

The food:

My absolute favorite dish at Besa Mi Taco is their tacos al pastor. &#39;Al Pastor&#39; is pork marinated with a blend of different spices. So for those of you who were broken hearted that pork could not be found on the menu because of a person&#39;s inability to read it correctly, have no fear, the pork at Besa Mi Taco is pure pleasure.  If you happen to be on a tighter budget, Besa Mi Taco also offers 99 cent tacos of ground beef and ground chicken.  Their tacos are the bulkiest tacos I&#39;ve ever eaten.  It is evident that the cooks are not shy when it comes to the amount of meat in the tacos. They also come garnished with lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. (If you&#39;re a picky eater like me, no one has a problem with adding cilantro, sour cream, and onions to the bulkiness.) In all honesty, your taste buds have to be altogether ruined for you to call the food bland.

Finally, the name Besa Mi Taco is quite comical to those with a sense of humor. There&#39;s nothing veiled about the name.  It comes complete with the slogan, &#34;Food so fresh, you wanna slap it.&#34;

I would recommend this tasty joint to anyone and everyone. I would also urge that if a restaurant has let you down more than twice, don&#39;t bother going back."

For appetizers, my go to will always and forever be their muthawama. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in it, but it tastes like heaven! 
Their food is very flavorful and definitely not on the bland side. They also have the best Pita bread I&#39;ve ever tasted in my life!! Service is hit or miss, but you don&#39;t have to deal with it much since you order and they bring it to your table. 
They have a rewards points system that I&#39;ve tried using but for whatever reason it never computes my points, so I gave up on it. Their prices are very reasonable, so I&#39;m ok not getting discounts - although they&#39;re always welcome. I hope they work on it.

PitaPita has become an addiction; I was legit ready to make this all 3 meals of the day!!

We had 2 vegetarian platters and 1 order of falafel.

The vegetarian platter consists of grape leaves, falafels, baba ghanoush, hummous, side of pita bread, and a fresh salad with a sumac (berry type of spice) type dressing.

These were all equally delicious but I have to really commend them on their falafel because this is so rare to find a place that makes the PERFECT falafel that doesn&#39;t taste bitter or too harshly fried. These were absolutely perfect and delicious. They have good sauces as well and I am wondering if they also carry this pungent, thick, garlicky paste/sauce.

All in all, 5 star customer service they&#39;re extremely catering and welcoming the food is 5/5.

Until next time Pita Pita, I will deeply miss you."

Lately I have really developed a craving for Mediterranean food.  I went out to Palatine last week to purchase a file cabinet that I saw on Craigslist.  When we were coming home around 7:30pm we were very hungry and found Pita Pita Mediterranean Grill in Groupon.  

That was a great find $20 for $12.  I looked on Yelp &amp; found PPMG is rated 4 1/2 stars.  In addition by checking in on Yelp I found that they offered a free appetizer (an added bonus).  Upon arriving the restaurant was packed as there was a baby shower occupied a good portion of the dining area.  

We went to the counter and ordered our food.  Both my wife and I ordered the mixed meat combo.  The combo came with beef kufta, beef &amp; chicken shawarma, succulent chicken pieces, chicken sausage, salad and rice. They were out of rice so the offered and alternative free of charge.  I ordered hummus and my wife got the Babganosh. (Not a bad trade).  For the appetizer the guy at the register suggested the garlic sauce.  Wow what an awesome suggestion this was pure heaven as we savored every bite with pita bread that was soft and fresh.

The only negative was the service was slow because there was a huge backlog of orders, but for me the food was second to none.  This was probably the best Mediterranean food I have ever tasted and is someplace I will come back to when I get a chance."

The food I ordered was sub par. There was no flavor -- it was bland. 

I had been excited to try this place as I love Mediterranean food. The disappointing factors make me never want to return again.

On top of it all, they don&#39;t make the food right; the meat is too dry, the sale is too oily.

There&#39;s plenty of parking and it&#39;s in a strip mall right next door to many other eateries. There were plenty of seats. It&#39;s kind of like a fast food Mediterranean place. You order your food at the counter and they bring your food out to you.

My friends and I ordered the baba ghanoush, stuffed grape leaves, meat and veggie, mixed meat, and lamb and veggie. (Make sure to use the Yelp deals to get a free appetizer.) The food was okay overall. I was disappointed with the lamb and veggie dish because it was mostly vegetables and there was barely any lamb. I thought the stuffed grape leaves would have meat in them but they did not. However, my friends informed me that I was thinking of Greek stuffed grape leaves, which do have meat in them, but Lebanese ones do not. They were also cold, unlike the Greek ones. The best part of the meal (for me) was the falafel and hummus (in the meat and veggie dish) and the salad.

The best prices are the best during the week at lunch. They also have lunch prices on the weekend but you have to specify that you want the lunch. I didn&#39;t know that and assumed I would be charged the lunch price because it was lunchtime, but when I looked at the receipt, I saw I was charged more so I told the cashier and he gave me the difference. The Business Lunch Special at Pita Inn is a better deal and I personally prefer the taste and sauces there.

The service was a bit spotty. When the food came out, they were confused as to which table to bring it out to so I had to flag them down. They forgot to bring hot tea I had ordered and my friend&#39;s baklava."

We&#39;re creatures of habit with our restaurant choices but we found ourselves outside our realm and looking for dinner.  What&#39;s nearby, Yelp?  Drawn by fantastic reviews and a check-in deal of a free appetizer we headed over...

First impression?  Dining area looks a little stark...  and... Oh no...you order at the counter!  BUT...there emerged a man who welcomed us.  And then there was the friendly counter man.  We don&#39;t typically go for Mediterranean food so looking at the menu took some time.  Finally,  we just asked for direction and the fellow advised us to share two plates, one meat and one veggie:  Mixed meat @ $11 &amp; Veggie plate @ $9.  Our free appetizer was Muthawma...basically thin mashed potatoes all Med&#39;d up.  Delicious.

Okay...that first impression?  Forget it.  As we sat there drinking our yummy Harney &amp; Sons tea I was enjoying the music...and still feeling so nicely attended to by the ordering process...and my gosh is this place clean!...and that &#34;stark&#34; decor was now darned appealing...  I was VERY much looking forward to our meal.

...and it didn&#39;t disappoint.  Plates crowded with the freshest, most colorful, unusual food you could ever hope to eat.  One of the dishes we ate we never would have thought to order in a million years...grilled eggplant and tomato pureed with lemon juice and garlic?  No!  Um...YES!  It&#39;s called Baba Ghanouj.  Just eat it.  Our food came with a basket of pita and we used it for dipping but one could have made sandwiches with them.  

This is my new favorite place.  We&#39;re so taken with it that we&#39;re considering them catering our daughter&#39;s upcoming wedding.  

They do a booming take-out business so you if you live close you are LUCKY!"

Hummus was really good. The fallafal for me was a little overdone and too dry. We also got the chicken kawook which came with yellow rice, tomato, onion and salad for $10, very tasty.

Good value and very flavorful."

Ordered the falafel plate, which came with 6 falafels, rice, fresh salad, and pita. They&#39;re pita is warm and fresh daily. As opposed to pita inn, the salad and rice taste more fresh. They do not use iceberg lettuce and they season their salad really well. The red sauce was perfectly spicy. The best part was the falafels themselves, they were bold in flavor and super crunchy. I would definitely recommend coming here for lunch, this place has definitely taken a spot over pita inn in my opinion. However, I still think naf naf is #1!"

I (event planner) hired Pita Pita to cater my client&#39;s backyard wedding and was very impressed with the quality of not only the food, but also the service. 

Service: From the food tasting that we did before selecting Pita Pita to the post-event communication checking for satisfaction, the service was fantastic.  After selecting this company for our event, Mustafa took time on multiple occasions to ensure that he fully understood the details of the event day. Through phone calls, texts, and emails, he clearly demonstrated his concern for ensuring that the details were taken care of.  He made himself available despite his busy schedule.  The food was delivered on time (in two waves) and the delivery staff were friendly, clean cut, and helpful. I can&#39;t say enough about how quickly and efficiently the delivery guys worked to get dinner going on time. Wonderful service.

Food: Superb. The wedding guests were delighted (and demanding business cards) and the bride and groom were raving. Let&#39;s be honest here, when is wedding food ever good? The food was flavorful, fresh, unique, and delicious.  The guests were absolutely thrilled. We had many leftovers and I admit, I&#39;m still enjoying them. 

Recommendations: Chicken Tawook, Beef Shish Kebab, Baba Ghanouj are all exceptional."

I&#39;ve come here a couple of times now; chicken tawook the first time, and chicken kufta the second time. This is a great place to go for some mediterranean flavor, though I advise ordering ahead; cooking can take 15-20 minutes.

Both times I&#39;ve gotten the wrap, and I&#39;ve been a big fan of both. The wrap as a whole is grilled at the end, and it&#39;s packed with hummus, veggies and excellently spiced chicken. The textures, temperatures and flavor are spot-on for what I expected.

I&#39;ve also gotten a few falafel here. They&#39;re crunchy, deeply browned and also very flavorful, especially dipped in fresh tahini sauce.

At some point I&#39;ll try the beef and lamb, but from what I&#39;ve had I can wholeheartedly recommend Pita Pita."

So please take my comments with that grain of salt.

First thing I wasn&#39;t ready for is it is an order and pay at the counter and they bring the order to your table based on a number that you are given kind of place. Not a big deal but I would have preferred table-side ordering.

The person at the counter was friendly and more than willing to answer any questions that we had, that was a big plus in my opinion. I also appreciated that the vegetarian and vegan dishes are clearly marked.

I tried the lentil soup- it is what I would call a large portion with the &#34;bowl&#34; size, I should have gone for the &#34;cup&#34;. Lots of flavor in this soup and it&#39;s possible to have at least three tastes depending on what you put in your spoon. A nice overtone of citrus. Only negative is that I expected it to be warmer... maybe it&#39;s supposed to be that way?

The falafel with my veggie plate was tasty if somewhat on the &#34;hard&#34; side. It just takes a bit more care when cutting it.

Other reviewers commented that the food was inexpensive; my feeling is that it was about what I expected if not a bit pricier. I don&#39;t feel that we were overcharged, but $30+ for two people who ordered somewhat modestly is not my definition of &#34;inexpensive&#34;. The other side of the coin is that we took home at least a lunch for one person of leftovers, so considering that, it&#39;s a bit better deal.

There is a lot of off-street parking available- but this may change when the new restaurant next door to Pita Pita opens."

I prefer the vegetarian middle eastern dishes and that is why Pita Pita is my clear winner. The food here is so fresh and exploding with flavor like mint, lemon, garlic, smokiness of the grill...The presentation is also so pretty!  I love their veggie platter which comes with the best baba ghanoush ever, I can eat spoonfuls of this alone! It has a smokiness about that is so addictive; also included is the best hummus ever too, stuffed grape leaves, 4 yummy/crunchy falafels, Arabic salad and pita bread.  You get so much food that I always have another meal to look forward to the next day!

I&#39;m not a big meat eater so I can&#39;t really say too much about their meat platters, but per my sister the edge goes to Pita Inn.  But honestly, I would still prefer Pita Pita if I wanted a meat platter because I know I will be getting fresher food and would get the best baba and hummus on the side!  Also, I prefer the baklava here than at Pita Inn.

Also, the decor is much nicer at Pita Pita; they recently remodeled and they did a beautiful job!  Plus the workers are super friendly and seem to really care about the food they are serving to you."

QUALITY is much better than pita house and they are opening 2 more locations in Lombard and Hoffman Estates.  The only complaint I have is that they charge for garlic sauce!

It was served soaked in sauce. It also had sliced pickles on it which had it been explained to me I would have declined them.

At 3:pm,the resturant was pretty much empty.
There were store managers and a corporate manager casually talking by the front counter. Not one of them greeted me or even made an attempt to thank me for my patronage.

Custmer service was not up to speed.

By authentic, I mean you can see them prepping the shawarma with spices and all, AND you can tell it&#39;s real shawarma.

I could be spoiled with well seasoned mediterranean food, but the food at this place was really bland. I had a chicken Shawarma wrap and the meat was too chunky to be the real deal.

On my first trip, I had a chicken lunch plate -- still a large portion of food for really cheap. I&#39;d much rather spend $6-7 here for a fresh, healthy lunch than on a processed sandwich at a greasy fast food restaurant. On my second visit (dinner), I had the vegetarian plate -- delicious falafel, baba ganoush, hummus, salad w/homemade dressing, and stuffed grape leaves.

I just had a surgical procedure yesterday and was craving some Mediterranean food. My husband found a Groupon for Pita Pita and I saw great reviews for this place. Of course I had to try it out. I must say my husband was a saint to come here as he dislikes Mediterranean food while I love it!  We walked in and I immediately saw for drinks they had Powerade! I was so happy to see this drink option because my surgery required me to drink electrolytes such as this and high sodium foods. Ok, perfect.....but it went downhill from there......

There was a large party in there as well as other filled tables. We noticed after ordering there was only ONE straw left in the straw dispenser and very few napkins left in the napkin dispenser. We had to ask the employees to fill both dispensers up. Keep in mind we dined here at 3pm in the afternoon right before dinner rush and after lunch rush. I noticed a certain stench that smelled of B.O. It was a rather disgusting scent that almost made me lose my appetite. I realized as soon as our food was served it came from an employee. You would think working in the service industry you would try your best to have good personal hygiene especially around customers. I ate my food as fast as possible so we could leave the awful stench. It made my dining experience here very difficult to enjoy.

The food was bland except for the salad that was the only thing going for them, but how hard is it to ruin salad?! I ordered the meat plate so I could get a whole variety of taste and options of meats they offer. The meats especially the Beef Kufta reminded me of frozen meat you would get in a frozen dinner meal....YUCK! I couldn&#39;t even eat it and gave it to my husband. Won&#39;t be dining here again and next time I&#39;m in need of my Mediterranean food fix I&#39;ll be heading to their competitor that I have been dining at for years in Wheeling. Hint....Hint.....Nudge...Wink

UPDATE: Last week the owner reached out to my husband and I regarding our negative experience here. I appreciate the owner reaching out to my husband and I."

My coworker raved about it and the reviews were all so positive. Boy am I glad we did! My husband and I could not believe how flavorful everything was. When we walked in the guy behind the counter (who was super friendly and helpful) asked if we were &#34;first timers&#34;, which we were, and gave us the recommendation of trying the veggie platter and the meat combo. We were excited to be able to try everything and man was it good. Our favorite was the chicken shawarma (rotisserie chicken) and the falafel. The only thing that we were not super crazy about was the stuffed grape leaves. It wasn&#39;t that it wasn&#39;t good, it just wasn&#39;t something that we would order again. Everything else was excellent. We joked that it was a one-stop ticket to flavor town. We told all our friends about this place and we will definitely be going back very soon!"

We started with lentil soup  (2.50 for cup / $4.00 for bowl).  If I had known how amazing the soup would be I would have ordered the bowl.  This could be the best lentil soup I have had in the United States.  The Bowl is twice as big as the cup.  Get the bowl.  This is awesome soup.  

We unlocked a free appetizer with the Yelp app and picked hummus.  The hummus was very good but there was nothing special about the pita.  We enjoyed the fatush and Babbaganoush... The other rock star on the menu was the falafel which was superb, fresh, rich and perfectly seasoned.  

Their chairs are all metal, hard, and slightly uncomfortable.   Try to grab seats along the upholstered wall bench seating which is more comfortable.  If this place opens another location they should use different chairs.  

The staff was friendly.  The food was outstanding.  The price an excellent value.  For casual Middle Eastern dining it does not get much better than this.  Five stars."

I did like the chicken, it was tender and very flavorful but the beef was very dry, so dry I couldnt even eat it. The rice was just ok, the salad was good and I enjoyed the hummus.

We really like this place. When you go in, you order at the counter. Above the counter is a lighted menu. Their prices are reasonable, and the food is great.

I was really hungry, although my wife was not. So, I orders mixed chicken and beef Shawerma with Hummos, Baba Ghanouj and a Jerusalem Salad. Lots of food, in fact way too much. The Shawerma is served with a mound of yellow rice and a salad. The salad is lettuce, cucumber, tomato with olive oil and mint. 

They also serve Pita. Their Pita bread is baked fresh there. Unlike other Middle Eastern restaurants I&#39;ve been to, they grill the Pita halves before service. This added crunch with the softness of the Pita was really nice.

We did not buy the Yelp $10 for $15 special. But, we did use the check in offer of a free side to get the Baba Ghanouhj. I&#39;m plenty full, and we had lots to bring home with us."

The service has never faltered from my original review. They are very nice and very customer oriented and they get shit done. If one slips through the cracks and something gets messed up, they make sure it gets fixed and the customer always walks away happy.

I have since expanded from the wraps and now i almost always get the mixed chicken entrees. It seems pricey but really you are getting a ton of food and can likely leave 2 people very satisfied off the one entree. 

If you have never heard of or never tried muthawama, do yourself a favor and get it. NOW! It&#39;s an amazing, creamy garlic god send and we never order without getting an order of that or the tomato and eggplant (if you like tomatoes you will love this).

Their kufta is seasoned so perfect and is always cooked right and by far they have the best pita around. It&#39;s a thinner pita and i have never seen anyone have the same style but it is also just sooo delicious. 

One thing i almost never get at any Mediterranean restaurant is falafel. It&#39;s usually dry and nasty and i don&#39;t know how or why people eat it. NOT the case here, i actually enjoyed every bite of the perfectly cooked, not dried out appetizer. 

I can literally go on for a while but idk why you are still reading this, get your ass over there and yelp that shit!!!"

The meat plate came out great.  10/10. They messed up big time on veggy plate. Forgot flafal on a veggy plate. Seriously?  I had to go to desk to remind the guy that something was missing from the plate. He was like ..oh no....it&#39;s just like that. I told him that I know it&#39;s not complete. After explaining to him, he understood the round edibles were missing and brought it saying...Ok...now it&#39;s complete...Enjoy! (No apology so far) and them after we were about to finish...I was waiting for coffee which never arrived. Had to approach cash register guy again to request my coffee which he brought politely. The other guy (apparently who messed our order) was too busy collecting dishes and was hard to call to the bench. Long story short...the food was like SUPER AWESOME. Cutting one star due to miscomfort I had with order. They could have compensated by an extra cup of coffee or so (although it&#39;s just a gesture of customer service and it wasn&#39;t expected by me either).  Seems like the kitchen rocks but the front desk customer service could be a bit better.
Would visit again though."

I walked in 25 minutes later, gave him my name and then waited an additional 20 minutes before my order was ready. Are you kidding me! It gets better... My bill was around $39 and some change. I gave him $40 cash and told not to worry about the rest. He proceeded to through the change in the enormous tip jar sitting at the counter and said... Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t spend it all at one place. I double take&#39;d! I could not believe this came out of this kids mouth. This pompous arrogant a**.  I drive my car 20 minutes to his facility, waste my gas, then get out to my car, walk inside to pick up my food I pre-ordered. Then wait an additional 20 minutes, then pay him my hard earned money and this little troll tries to make me feel like I short changed him after spending almost $40 in this restaurant. WTF! Do you tip the guy at the drive through window when you order food? Better yet... Do you walk back in the kitchen at a sit down restaurant and give the people cooking your food a tip. Maybe next time I drive through the toll booth I should tip the person taking my money? What the hell is wrong with people today? Entitlement generation I guess. I must be too old school. BTW.

1) They only get better.  Case-in-point:  I KNOW their falafels have gotten bigger since my initial review. They have a great layer of flavor (with a hint of lemony goodness), and I know they make them by hand as they toss &#39;em into the fryer. 

2) They always have deals: Groupon deals, Yelp Check-In deals, and Facebook Check-In deals. 

3)  Portions are VERY generous.  I&#39;m a girl who can EAT, and my favorite entree (Veggie Plate) lasts me two days.

4) They&#39;re passionate and hard-working. Tonight there were only two guys: one cooking ALL of the food, and the other guy manning the register, getting extra plates and cups, directing a little kiddo how to use the water feature on the fountain machine, serving and bussing tables, and organizing To-Go orders.  Holy multitasking, Batman!  He did it all with a smile and never once let on he was stressed out.  I&#39;d be pulling my hair out.

5)  They remember their customers (or at least make an effort to learn your name).  The Multitasking Register Guy interacted with some of the regulars and even remembered my name, AND brought out my To-Go order from behind the counter and nicely handed it to me!

6)  They try to &#34;right&#34; any &#34;wrongs.&#34;  I HATE to put it out there (&#39;coz I love &#39;em so much), but last time I got take-out, they forgot to include the pita bread.  (Hey, sh!t happens, right?) I called and they were apologetic and took down my name to ensure I was comped on my next order.  Also, tonight they were (SADLY!) out of stuffed grape leaves when I got there during the dinner rush.  I was soooo looking forward to them, but they nicely subbed something else (falafel, nomnomnom!).

7)  They try to make their customers happy:  Again, apologizing for waits, thanking customers, and giving extra sauces upon request.  

Customer service is HUGE in my book, as is (obviously) great food. 

Speaking of food... time for me to chow down on that Veggie Plate!"

When I got there to pick it up, the service couldn&#39;t be better. They were so helpful and wrapped everything up very nicely - and even gave me advice on how to best keep the food warm when I got home.

The catering pricing was very reasonable and in fact, I think we ordered too much! We had 15 people, but we should&#39;ve ordered for 10-11 because of how much food they give. 

And, everything was absolutely delicious! The falafel pieces are huge and the rice is to die for. And don&#39;t forget about the hummus...fantastic! Give this place a shot - they are now our go-to place for catering orders."

After debating between Georgios and Lou, I decided to go with Lou because it was a lot cheaper. My memories of LM from the original Lincolnwood location made me stray away from this place for a long time. I have a hard time, and often embarrassed, with tourists eating here. It&#39;s always been too salty. However, this Lou on Barrington was different. I think I like it better than the original.

As most have said, its a carry out. I ordered a personal LM special online and as promised, it was ready on time. As I received this tiny box, I was kinda upset at myself for not ordering the small. How was this little pie going to fill me up? Well, 3/4 of the pizza later, I was proven wrong. Small yet filling. And my original complaint of too much salt has been solved. I found myself adding salt actually. 

The ingredients were kinda fresh. I&#39;m not sure why, but I tasted a frozen pizza like quality. Couldn&#39;t put my finger on it, but it wasn&#39;t 100% fresh. In any case, this is a nice place to go for a somewhat cheap personal pizza. Ended up costing me around $10. Any other chain would have been a larger pizza for price. And usually I say you get what you pay for. However, in this case, $10 at Jets is better spent. Maybe I&#39;m just sad because the best pizza place on earth, Burt&#39;s, closed down. I guess I&#39;m just longing for a damn good pie to sweep me off my feet again."

I&#39;d been a Geno&#39;s East fan for years and wouldn&#39;t stray much further down the road than Pizzeria Uno or Due when in the Wind-town.

But this day, we found ourselves in the northwestern burbs and decided to jump at the opportunity to sample our first pie from another long-time Chicago legend of &#34;za&#34; who started some 40 years ago in Lincolnshire, IL.

We ordered the &#34;veggie&#34; pie which included your &#39;shrooms, red onions, green peppers, black olives...and then slipped in the pepperoni as an added topping.  The kitchen chipped in a generous amount of their signature Malnati sauce and fresh mozzarella.  Two things stood out:  We loved the hearty crust and the unique spicy-sweet tomato sauce as we took our time savoring every bite.  

With this dining experience, Lou Malnati&#39;s has become our new go-to 4-star pizza joint when in the Windy City."

Stop shaking your head at me...People wonder what kind of girl grows up in the Chicagoland area who doesn&#39;t just LOVE Lou&#39;s. Yeah well that would be me. My husband and my son are fans of the sausage patty and the chunk tomatoes all over the place and the combination of all that noise. I just want to eat their crusts. Shhh, don&#39;t tell. 

So when my son suggested carryout from Lou Malnati&#39;s last weekend, I reluctantly agreed.  They ordered the usual in all of it&#39;s Chicago deep dish glory. And I decided that I would subject myself to waiting around for crusts. I tried an individual deep dish with pepperoni and easy sauce. 

When I placed the order over the phone, the gal asked if I wanted the pizza cut or uncut. Annoyed, I said cut and tried to figure out why they would be so lazy. Then I thought beyond my hungry annoyance and asked why someone would order the pizzas uncut. I learned that they stay hotter longer and the crust stays crispier until you cut it. Well duh!  Why didn&#39;t I think of that? They use a good amount of sauce which will drip down to the crust if you cut it. They aren&#39;t lazy...they&#39;re smart. Uncut those pizzas please!

Let&#39;s just say that we enjoyed dinner so much that we did it again later in the week. I think I need a frequent pizza punch card or something..."

Great deep dish pizza! Lou can go head to head with Gino&#39;s any day. I recently went on the &#34;other side&#34; and tried the Lou which is a vegetarian pizza (Fresh spinach, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese). Normally I am a carnivore, but my wife was craving spinach pizza and this seemed like a good choice. Unlike Gino&#39;s thick deep dish crust, Lou&#39;s crust is more balance with less dough and more butter flavor which can be amped up with butter crust option (0.75 cents more). The pizza itself has significant toppings with cheese that can be pulled across the room. The sauce is not too sweet or salty and the ingredients are fresh.

The shop itself is great, super small for carryout and delivery only. Staff was super friendly. The only reason Lou is not 5 star is the cost. For a large deep dish for 4 people, it cost 24 w/ tax.

Pro- one of the best deep dish pizza in chicago, fresh ingredients, deep dish without a super thick crust, butter crust upgrade

Con- $$$ more than papa john or pizza hut

To be honest, of the times I have eaten it...I usually don&#39;t remember what the pizza tasted like. And i&#39;m not surprised based on my latest experience. 

I ordered two large thin crust pizzas: cheese and pepperoni. I also ordered a side of cheese bread. I wanted to try the deep dish, but my boyfriend had already tried the Gino&#39;s East version and said no to &#34;tomato soup pizza&#34;.  So that was out of the equation for now. 

Overall, I was disappointed. The pizza was just so...blah. The middle pieces were very gloppy, and I had to re cut the pizza because whoever cut it the first time did a poor job of it. The edges were decent, buttery but bland. The cheese bread was OK so long as it was dipped in the marinara sauce provided. Otherwise, it tasted as if someone threw garlic salt on the bread,threw on some non-flavored cheese, and called it a day.

Maybe it&#39;s a Chicago thing I just don&#39;t &#34;get&#34;. This pizza was similar to the kind you ate at the Coachlite birthday parties or if you are desperate for some grub at Brunswick Zone (if you couldn&#39;t tell, I&#39;m a born and raised Roselle kid). Nonetheless, I felt like I overpaid for the meal, which came out to about $40 without any coupons. 

Sort of related, but a Facebook friend of mine posted this and I thought it fit the situation well: http://go-go-go.org/2013/02/04/how-to-visit-chicago-like-a-chicagoan/

I&#39;m willing to try the full restaurant experience someday. But overall, I wasn&#39;t impressed. I&#39;ll stick to my Michigan/Wisconsin style pizzas.

Something about the sausage, perfect taste that you crave from here.  And the sauce is fabulous! Best pizza in the Universe...:)

Nor were the tomatoes roasted, appeared to have been placed on top after the pizza was &#39;heated&#39;. Was this an inexperienced cook and lack of quality control? I will not again spend $20 to find out and so will stay with Mannatti&#39;s.

Although I am not a big fan of deep dish in general, as it is too doughy for my tastes, Malnati&#39;s did a very admirable job of making the crust thin, meaning it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;ve just swallowed a flat tire in your digestive tract. The ingredients were fresh and came together nicely. 

One thing that really surprised me was when I went to heat up the left-overs the following day. Often times when you order deep dish, re-heating the scraps just gives you an uncontrollable ball of mushy dough and cheese with a texture that is unfit to be eaten. Because Lou&#39;s started out with a thinner crust, the results when popped in the micro weren&#39;t all bad. Granted, there&#39;s nothing like a fresh pie, but for seconds, this was quite edible. 

I&#39;ll have to try and stop by the location they have here in Schaumburg and rate the dine-in experience."

I brought my family that was in from out of town to this place for some real Chicago style deep dish pizza. The parking lot was packed... in fact this place had 3+ parking lots full of cars. Next door is a divey looking bar. Don&#39;t park there because they will have your car towed (allegedly... we moved our car when he yelled at us). Once inside, we were seated upstairs. The place feels more like a home than a restaurant. We had hot wings and calimari for appetizers, and we ordered a deep dish sausage and a thin crust pepperoni for dinner. My family was amazed by how thick the deep dish was and the fact that the sausage was the same size as the pizza. They preferred the thin crust though because they like their toppings above the sauce. You can&#39;t teach good taste. Overall the food and atmosphere are great. I think the Buffalo Grove location is better though not by too much."

Definitely good, filling, and tasty pizza. My only minor quibbles was the fact that the tomato sauce overwhelmed the other ingredients (pepperoni, and sausage). I guess if you are a huge fan of tomato sauce you would love it! I still rate Giordano&#39;s higher but if you are craving good pizza try this place out."

My husband LOVES Chicago pizza so for his birthday I had Lou&#39;s shipped to us in NYC. I placed the order several weeks in advance, &amp; they never forgot about me. I received the pizza on the day expected, packaged in dry ice. I then kept it frozen for 3 days until his birthday. 
Let me tell you.. it tasted just like we were sitting there in the Chicago restaurant. It was INCREDIBLE. I&#39;m so glad I ordered 4 pies for the two of us... Many days of Lou&#39;s to come!!!"

I have never eaten in the restaurant, but if you are looking for a great Chicago style deep dish pizza without the commute, this is the place to order from.  What&#39;s great is that you can get thick or thin crust.  If you like sausage, which is what my family always gets, there is a layer of that throughout the entire pizza.  Delicious! 

Another great thing about this place is that if you want their pizza to have on hand at home, you can buy frozen pizzas from them as well. The place is fantastic! Highly recommend them!"

Two things to note. 1. I was very impressed that Lou Malnati&#39;s cared enough about their customer to take the time to find out the details. 2. After giving the location one last try I found the Pizza quality to be just what I had grown to love and expect of years.

I ordered a Sausage with Garlic and the butter crust, it was a little under cooked for my liking but it was hot and gooey and full of flavor, the crust was just right flaky but firm, and full of buttery goodness

Not to make chicagoans gasp, but what can I say born and raised in dc maybe it&#39;s just not my thing. I will say though that I once in a while enjoy the deep dish at lou malnati&#39;s.  I like the Lou and I add sausage because they definitely are on point seasoning it. They also have a Buffalo Chicken Watermelon salad that is unfortunately seasonal only. That was amazing though. For authentic chicago food experiences I take my guests here.  The appetizers are all standard defaults (ei. buffalo wings, onion rings, etc.), but they are delicious for what they are.

This pizza is the shit! The crust is the best thing about it; thick deep dish butter crust yummm. There is really no word to describe the overall pizza but unique. Another thing about it that i like a lot is the chunky tomato sauce that gets put on top of the cheese. i like it so much i ask for extra whenever i order. When i go i get the spinach deep dish butter crust pizza. We order larges at a time in my house because the leftovers are just as good as when its pipping hot right out of the oven. I say leftovers because 2 slices with definitely fill you up if not only 1. Another unique aspect about Lou&#39;s pizzas is if you order a sausage pizza it&#39;s like they put 1 thick whole layer of the sausage underneath the cheese. Of course if you don&#39;t want that much sausage you can just ask them to put little pieces of it. 

The pizzas can get a little pricey, but trust me it&#39;s worth every bite. If you come to Chicago you HAVE to try this pizza.. even worse.. if you live in Chicago and you haven&#39;t tried this pizza, whats wrong with you?"

Family got deep dish while I got thin crust. Now I know the chain is known for their deep dish but I&#39;m not a huge fan of it. I do love my thin crust tho. I have to say the thin crust was probably the WORST I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m used to a nice golden cheese color even on my frozen pizza and this was like they nuked it, barely cooked. Cheese was completely white like it hadn&#39;t felt the heat of an oven. Sauce was like they poured it from a can. Why this place is popular is a mystery. The worst frozen pizza ive had was better then this. I forced down two pieces, were normally two pieces is a tease. The deepdish looked good but I didn&#39;t hear any applause over that.

Chicken Parmesan, lemon chicken, four types of pasta, and so much bread. So when our friends invited us to a tiny little Italian place in Addison a couple of weeks ago, I wasn&#39;t expecting much.

I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong - this place was fantastic! The menu is huge and varied, the specials were exciting and different, and the service was incredible. Our waiter offered several off-menu combinations as suggestions, which I thought was a fantastic touch. I&#39;m normally wary of servers who don&#39;t ever write a single thing down, but this guy was smart, funny, patient, put us right at ease, and made the whole experience great.

The interior is kind of dark and cheesy, but the seating was fine. We got sat in a corner and we were able to talk quietly and enjoy the company of our friends without the standard hustle and bustle that makes typical Italian restaurants so loud and hectic.

I got the lobster ravioli, which came with a saffron cream sauce. Typically saffron + cream = massive heavy food coma, but this was delicate and subtle. The ravioli had a robust sweet lobster flavor and were packed full. There were six ravioli on my plate and I was stuffed.

We will definitely be back to indulge in too much wine, delicious decadent food, and perfect service. What a hidden gem in Addison!"

I hope construction finishes soon b/c everyone needs to find and try this amazing Italian spot!

We came on the early side on a Friday and were seated right away. Our server greeted us and took our drink orders. Another server brought bread, oil, and cheese to the table. Their bread is soft and delicious, and I had to make myself resist having more than one piece. All our meals came with soup or salad. I got their cheddar broccoli which was good without being too creamy/cheesy. For my entree, I got their Tortellini Pasticciata which is cheese tortellini with ham, peas, mushrooms, tomatoes and mozz on top (no mushrooms for me though). Dad got chicken vesuvio and bf got a pizza w smoked salmon, mozz, and tomatoes. First of all, my dish was HUGE. The three of us easily could have split it, but I was happy to have the leftovers. It was incredible - rich and cheesy without being over the top. The other two were very happy with their choices as well. I wanted dessert but unfortunately had no room.

The warm tomato focaccia bread was the perfect start to our lengthy lunch. We caused the lengthiness which may be part of why this is not my new favorite restaurant. One of the members of our party needed to step out, but this was right after we ordered. So, we asked them not to put in the order until he returned. They agreed and then brought out the soup and salad. There was some confusion, so we sent it back. 

My water glass was never empty which I appreciated because the restaurant was practically empty, so they were pretty attentive.  When we were ready, the salad that was supposed to be lightly dressed was dripping in dressing. Thankfully, they willingly brought a fresh salad with the dressing on the side. The beef barley soup was different. It looked like a chicken broth base as far as the color was concerned. There was no real beef flavor to be found. There was a couple small pieces of beef, but the soup was too greasy. I didn&#39;t love it. 

My hubby had the calamari spaghetti. This was quite tasty and had a nice spicy tomato sauce!  I went with the chicken vesuvio. The chicken breasts were seasoned nicely and the sauce was pretty good (although maybe a little too salty for the average bear), but the potatoes were not worth the calories. They were not fresh and that annoyed me. There was a beautiful whole fish presentation at the table. Then the fish was cleaned and served. Unfortunately, the bones were heavily prevalent throughout the dish once it was served. 

To wrap up the meal, we had a piece of tiramisu. This WAS worth the calories. I ate more than my fair share and it made the meal!

I went to dinner with my parents and had the worst experience. My dad ordered a pasta dish, which came with a side salad. When my dad got his salad, there was a piece of plastic in it. He told the bus boy and waitress (who was very apologetic). As if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, when his pasta came out there was a hair in his first bite. He didn&#39;t eat the pasta and again let the waitress know. When the bill came, we expected his meal to be taken off. Well it wasnt!! The manager told us he was not taking the meal off and instead would only take his beverage off (a $2 ice tea). He also tried to make the situation better by telling us &#34;the salad is complementary.&#34; NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO THERE!!!!! I advise everyone to be on the look-out for plastic and hair!!"

My wife had a Grouper special which was very tasty and I had a Penne Silciliano special that was excellent.  We had a glass of wine with our meal, but didn&#39;t have room for desert.

You do get a nice big bowl of soup or a big salad with your meal.  Their pasta is delicious - and I recently had their ricotta stuffed gnocci special with a pesto sauce - amazing!

After viewing the room, selecting a menu, and confirming the date and time for the banquet, we thought we would be in good hands. Unfortunately, this was not the case. We arrived at the restaurant after the cemetery to an empty restaurant and locked doors. We tried calling the nnber on the sign, but there was no answer.  We were stuck in the cold, after spending the day saying goodbye to ouour loved one.

For dinner, I had the chicken florentine with spinach, roasted red pepper, and melted mozzerella on top. REALLY good. Hubby had something off the menu but was changed a little. Salmon with a lemon butter sauce and linguine which he liked. We finished with a slice of tiramisu. It wasn&#39;t anything different from any other italian restaurant.

The food options were impressive and hard to choose from, you just wish you could sample everything in one sitting. The Specials of the day just added to the excitement of what to have, knowing that it was going to be good before you even tasted it. Very descriptive and the wait staff was impeccable in making suggestions, helping you to decide what you should try from soup and salad, to appetizer and entree. The beer was extra cold and the bread served was warm and savory. I wish I could eat there daily, but no one wants to work off that many calories on a daily basis, but perhaps would be worth the trade off. 

The restaurant is in an unpretentious location, almost a older strip mall that can be missed, especially during rush hour traffic. I promise you it&#39;s worth the trip and the decor is warm and welcoming on the inside an opposite reflection of what you see on the outside. This is an experience to have and the passion of the waitstaff and chef shines with their extensive knowledge and poetic descriptions of the food.

This is maybe the 4th or 5th restaurant in the same place, which more than doubled in size sometime back there in the 80s or 90s. The dining room is very nice, dark wood, but enough light to make it seem elegant, not dark.  The service was casual.  That is to say we told the server that we were in no hurry, and needed to unwind and chatter, and he took our cue and didn&#39;t rush us at all, yet he was always there when we needed him.  We started with an antipasto platter which was amply sized for two, and was comprised of the usual fresh ingredients, very nice. My dinner companion had a green salad, and I had soup.  Aside from the mandatory Minestrone, the choice was clam chowder, &#34;Red clam chowder,&#34; the server said, &#34;Boston.&#34;  I favor Manhattan chowder over the creamy New England style, and I was sure that was what he meant.  But this was spicier than any I&#39;d had before, not exacltly like Manhattan style, but delicious. Maybe there really is a 
Boston style clam chowder.   My favorite Italian restaurant fare is Chicken Vesuvio and this did not disappoint, was perhaps the best version of this dish I&#39;ve had.  The chicken breasts were very tender, yet flavorful. mzy friend ordered a dish from the sizable specials menu, beef braciole.  He said it was amazing, and I&#39;m certain it was.
The menu promises so many more special meals, I&#39;m certain to return soon.  The prices were moderate too, the bill did not shock us."

Our group had the Chicken Vesuvio, Braciole, and Seafood Stew.  Each dish was delicious.  My 4 star instead of 5 star rating is based on the fact that our salads were limp and soggy because they were so drenched in balsamic/oil dressing, there were lantern type candles on the tables but none were lit so the dining room was quite dark.

If there were a more than 5 star option, I would have enthusiastically given it to them. We were there early on a Friday night (5pm), no wait. Atmosphere is upscale and cozy. We had just drove 16 hours and came straight here as I had been here in the past.....so for anyone to say they were &#34;snubbed&#34; for any reason, I would have to completely disagree. We rolled up in there hungry, smiling, tired with yoga pants on, hair in a bun and they still treated us like regulars!!!
Service was fantastic throughout the entire meal. The host that sat us explained in detail (to the point we were almost drooling) about any of the menu items that we were inquisitive about and even offered his suggestions based on what we were thinking of ordering. 
Bread: it&#39;s bread, it&#39;s always good
App: Caprese Bufala which was on the printed &#34;specials&#34; menu. This dish was absolutely fantastic! We ate every last bite!
Salad: iceberg, romaine, spinach topped with a mouth watering balsamic vinaigrette, there was also a soup choice but we both got the salad
Main dish #1: Rigatoni Boscaiola. This was so awesome, this was my friends entree and I couldn&#39;t stop eating hers!!!! Someone at the table HAS to get this!!!
Main dish #2: Meat Ravioli &#34;special&#34; menu, this was still delicious, but not as good as my friends.
Dessert: couldn&#39;t fit it, we both took our leftover pasta home
Price was right. I would go here once a week just to try something new as it is hard to decide what to have.

Yes, we&#39;re new to your establishment, etc, etc, but come on!  Whatever was going on in that place, I felt totally discriminated against.  BTW, all the below are just choice highlights, cataloging the entire experience makes for a waaay overlong review.

15 minutes to get a menu.  Water came later.  Waiter just came to take our order.  After taking care of, going over all the specials, AND serving an appetizer to the adjacent couple who came in AFTER us.  WTF?

Well, we consoled ourselves, based on the other Yelpers, the food will be great, at least.  WTF?  The wine was vinegary.  The salad was so wilted and looked like it had been sitting around for a week (of course he only brought out one salad and forgot the other), stale bread.  Lame tasteless crap with watery sauce - people, I&#39;m sure this food was great 50 years ago, when no-one knew better, but, hello!, have you heard of sauce reduction, spices, herbs?  Two stars for the decor - remodeled, nice, the pizza was decent, and the pasta was ok, it was al dente.  Everything was so oversalted, we got our sodium intake for the year.

We were very nice and polite, and tipped 20%, because, as usual, we&#39;re not interested in scenes or complaining.  We just don&#39;t roll that way, even when we should.  OTOH I ran a very entertaining commentary on facebook, and our friends&#39; hilarity and instant responses to our pain while we sat there saved the evening.  And now Yelp.  I feel better.

We ordered our meal off of the specials menu.  First we had the Oysters Rockefeller.  The oysters we okay.  Nothing special, rather bland tasting.  Followed by salads.  The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was wonderful.  Unfortunately I do not remember the names of the meals that we ate.  The waiter described my husband&#39;s meal as an Italian Beef Stroganoff with a very light wine sauce.  We should have listened better to the description.  The meal had a VERY light wine sauce.  It was good, but not as much flavor as we had hoped.  My meal on the other hand was absolutely wonderful. The waiter described my meal as a lasagna noodle with spinach, ricotta cheese and mozzarella cheese with a vodka sauce.  The vodka sauce was so delicious.  The portions were a generous size so we were each able take some home.  I even told my husband not to eat my leftovers because I wanted to enjoy it for lunch the next day.   I was so disappointed when I went to eat my lunch the next day and discovered the vodka sauce was not put into the take-home container. I wish I could have put my own leftovers into the container.

What an awesome find!  This restaurant, tucked in a non-descript strip mall off of Lake Street, is easy to miss and has been the site of several Italian restaurants.  I pass by here frequently as it&#39;s right on the way to the local Caputo&#39;s produce store.  

After hearing the buzz about this place from a couple of friends, one of who hails from Italy, we stopped in last night for a late dinner.  The place was empty (around 9:30), but the bartender/server was absolutely solicitious and helpful.  

Here&#39;s a great tip about this restaurant: go for the specials if possible.  Now I did not order anything on the regular menu, which was fairly interesting and comprehensive for an Italian restaurant; and I&#39;m sure that their regular entrees were good.  But the specials - very unique and have to be tried!

We were going to order a buffala mozzarella caprese, but the server advised us to try another special cheese from the Apuglia region of Italy - apparently difficult to get in this country but the chef imports it in.  The cheese, burrata, is a pouch of bufala mozzarella, filled with panna (cream).  Served over a bed of fresh, delicious arugula, with a very thin slice of parma prosciutto, this is an absolutely orgasmic dish - simple combination of wonderfully fresh ingredients!

As the server recited the specials, it was apparent that they do unique food - rabbit, goat, quail, unique fish - all can be found on their specials menu.  In fact, the server told us that if you are planning on coming in on the weekend, just call them and let them know what you want - they&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s ready for you!  Kind of like eating at your Italian grandma&#39;s house!

We opted for the quail, done spectacularly in a demi-glace sauce; and an orata fish, which is a seabream fish common to the Bari region (where my gramps hails from!).  Baked whole with rosemary and olive oil, it was to die for.

They also make an &#34;almost&#34; authentic version of Italian pizza - delish!

Great selection of Italian wines and they carrry the Danny DeVito limoncello as well.

They&#39;ve also got these storage bins, located in a large cabinet on the wall of one of the dining areas, that you can rent to store your favorite wine selections, all available at a discounted price.  So you can go there with clients, start a bottle of wine, and then they&#39;ll store your unused portion in your bin to be used on another occasion.

I&#39;d give it 5 stars but I want to try it again before I do that.  

Prices - specials are not cheap but not bad for the unique quality of food.  Menu prices are fairly reasonable. Pastas start around $14 and entrees can go upwards to $30.  The high end of the price range is for the more unique specials, though.

Atmosphere:  it was pretty quiet when we were there, although the bar filled up with a couple of people.  Honestly, I loved the place - the owners and bartender were cool, full of information, and very friendly. They definitely take pride in their food and in their establishment.  

Give it a try - it&#39;s a hidden gem that I hope does well."

Excellent grilled calamari and vegetables, a healthy alternative to the usual deep fried calamari with marinara. Our 2 1/2 year old son loved it too.  We ordered 2 pizzas for the three of us, with appetizer, and the pizzas were larger than we expected.  Simply made, thin crust and not excessively salty as pizza usually is.  The ingredients were so flavorful and high quality! This is our new #1 wood oven pizza place. I should add that my husband  and I have been on a cross country quest for the best wood oven pizza as an on-going hobby (he has a big green egg and often experiments himself).

I will say when we drove up, we didn&#39;t know what we would be in for. The restaraunt is in a tired strip mall off Lake Street.  The lobby area smelled vaguely of the old cigarette smoking days no longer allowed... seemed to need a freshening up.

This is a fantastic find, friendly people and unpretentious, authentic good food. We can&#39;t wait to go back and try the meals everyone else is raving about. We can&#39;t pass up the pizza, though! I would not order it to go - best eaten right there."

Let me start out by saying that the service was the best!! Our waiter was very helpful and accommodating. We were told what the special appetizers were for the day and we decided on the stuffed artichoke. I was really expecting something great for close to $10 but this was a huge disappointment. It had no flavor in the bread crumb stuffing and it was served in some kind of milky looking sauce. Hubby had lasagna and really all you could see was an orange looking sauce drenched on the plate and lots of melted cheese. You had to kind of dig thru it to find the actual lasagna and it was according to him just okay. I had the chicken vesuvio. When did Italian restaurants all start using boneless chicken breasts instead of pieces of chicken in their vesuvio? The chicken really did not have a lot going for it but the sauce over the chicken and on the plate and potatoes was really, really good. 

Just so-so. We will not go back."

When you pull into the plaza where this gem sits your first thought is that perhaps a wonderful Italian restaurant would not be located here.  From the outside you are still not sold.  When you walk in however, you are greeted by friendly staff and then served by a waiter who is probably one of the best in the business.  I never got his name but you will know him as he is pretty much the only waiter in this 12-15 table establishment.  This man knows everything about anything at Nuova.  You can eat and drink with confidence as he will guide you through whatever it is your heart and stomach desire.  I&#39;m not a big wine fan but wanted a glass of red.  He asked whether or not I liked dry and I said yes.  He brought me an amazing glass of I don&#39;t know what but it was perfect and inexpensive.  We tried the pizza an we&#39;re not disappointed.  It was so light and fresh that I could have been satisfied at that.  Oh, and the warm bread including focaccia was outstanding.  For our mains we had the fresh, homemade ravioli made in the shape of won tons with vodka sauce.  It literally melted in my mouth.  The other main was a rigatoni with sausage and mushrooms in a cream sauce.  Our of this world fresh and al dente perfection.  Our amazing waiter explained to us that they can make pretty much anything else that is not on the menu.  We were so full that we did not do dessert but I can only imagine how great that would have been.  In closing, I want to go back in that kitchen and hug whoever is back there because he/she has really set the standard for excellence and freshness in Italian dining.  Finally, the waiter is the best.  If any five star, exclusive, fancy restaurant ever got a hold of this man they would immediately be better off.  I hope he never leaves because Nuova Italia is complete with him running the show!"

So to give a little back ground, I used to live in Hoffman estates for about 3 years before i got married and moved to Wheaton. Every time i come here i get the Bhel puri or roti subji, which is usually 2 soft freshly preped rotis, subji of your choice and i always choose chole (chickpeas) and paneer subji. 

The ladies who prep the food are very sweet and kind and always have a smile and so does the young guy who owns the store. Now to the poor customer service...

They are just terrible, when either the old lady or the old man is in the front, billing. Some of the issues I have faced...

No amex....can you give me cash.....no card below $10 and the old owners are pretty strict about it. Also i have never ever seen them smile at the customer ever, oh if you speak Gujarati then they might, which i don&#39;t. If you call and place an order and if you are unlucky where the old guy takes the call, for sure your orders are going to be messed up. 

The only reason they get a 4 star is cause their food is always fresh and tastes good."

CONS 
1. busboy is the person cooking so pretty much the person who mops uses the same hands etc to cook again 
2. Got raw poori dough in the poori choley ; inedible will cause stomach ache 
3.Ordered samosa the next time ; it was burnt like maybe oil is old in fryer ; complained about it and got fresh one made ; not crunchy in any way the outer shell was just plain nasty

I&#39;m becoming impatient in my old age. As a 26 year-old, I don&#39;t have time to be waiting around for delicious treats. I want it all and I want it now! My first visit here left much to be desired.

I came in on a hot day and the dessert display was barely visible through the thick layer of condensation that kept me from thoroughly checking out the case. On top of that, I wasn&#39;t welcomed when I entered. There was no, &#34;I&#39;ll be with you in a second.&#34; I took my initial 5 minutes to attempt to decide what I wanted, then I waited 10 minutes for someone to come help me and no one ever did. I even moved closer to the register and pretty much stared the woman down and they never acknowledged me. I finally gave up and left without purchasing anything. I started a review but decided to give them a second chance and I&#39;m glad I did. It was like night and day.

Yesterday I stopped in because I was in the area. I was immediately welcomed and given a bit of space to browse. I could clearly see everything offered, but I wish it had been labeled. I&#39;ve had these treats before, so I kinda knew what I wanted; however, it&#39;s pretty clear they usually have customers who are much more familiar with the cuisine. Nothing is labeled and it made it a little hard to decide.

I went with the 1lb box and then stared blankly at all my choices while the poor woman working the counter tried to help me out. A sweet older gentleman stepped out from behind the display and started giving me suggestions. He explained some of the cookies and cakes, which gave me a better idea of what I was ordering. He even offered me a couple samples.

I haven&#39;t had a chance to try the Grill aspect of this place yet, but the dessert counter is a must if you have any sense of adventure and a love of almonds, cardamom and saffron. The burfee, kesar penda and julabi are my favorites. If you&#39;re not sure what to get, try a little bit of everything. I highly recommend the assorted mix-and-match boxes."

Same story with coconut chutney they give, sometimes the frozen ice is not melted fully. Ambience is great, owners look tired and exhausted always, not interested to talk.

She went next door to our beloved Bamboo Garden to get something else since she&#39;s still starving. 
Yvette C. and I are still sitting here eating....inspecting...
Not quite hungry now....

I love samosa&#39;s.
But their samosas are more expensive than Milan Chat - a dollar each.
We love Milan Chat.
Why did we ever stray?
To try something new I guess.
See where that gets us?
I will never come back here.
Booooooooooooooo!!!!
That is all..."

The service sucked. It doesn&#39;t seem like the people there want to help. Nobody said a word to me when I walked in. I couldn&#39;t even tell who was working there. Eh.

I stood on the sweets side for like 5 minutes looking for what I wanted. I almost walked out because I know I saw a neon sign that said &#34;SAMOSAS&#34; on the outside window, but I saw none inside. When I finally figured out that there is a sweets side &amp; a savory side, I went over to the savory side &amp; the lady put my order in a carry out container. I would have gotten more stuff if she would have explained it a little... I asked about some things &amp; it seemed like she didn&#39;t want to help so I just left it alone. Still, they took forever to give me my order, even after I paid.

Aside from the service, I thought the samosas were probably one of the best ones I&#39;ve tried outside of the places I&#39;ve been to in the city. Pretty surprising.

It was good price &amp; the green sauce was really good, a bit too sweet, but the flavors were amazing. I would go back for the samosas &amp; green sauce. Maybe I&#39;ll try something else next time too. Maybe not."

Absolutely Horrible Service and even worse food!! !Avoid it at all cost. .We were debating over going to Uru-Swati on Devon v. Sukhadia in Schaumburg. I whole heatedly regret my choice. 

We went there for my Dad&#39;s birthday as he used to like this place. We have been there a few times in the past and the food never tasted this bad. The lady at the register was extremely rude with a horrible attitude. I asked her if they have Paper Dosa, She responds with one word &#34;Sada Dosa&#34;. I asked her again, and same response. She could have said we do not have that, instead you can order Sada dosa. I saw her same attitude with other customers. 

We get the Masala dosa and Samosa Chat. The food tastes like crap. i told my wife we make 10 times better at home. The Sambhar didn&#39;t even taste like Sambhar. My wife tried the Maisuri dosa and it was covered with plenty of Garlic, she could only eat 25% of the dosa and had to throw away the rest. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not go to this place....these guys need a lot of restructuring!"

So looked up on the Yelp mobile app to find a similar place near by. VOILA!! Sukhadia&#39;s Sweets and Indian just across the street. GOSH why didn&#39;t I read the reviews.
But anyways I have been to their Devon ave location in Chicago and that was kind of okay and though to myself that this is going to be better than that.

So we got in decided what we want and placed the order. I ordered a soft drink, but the lady did not tell me that i have to go to cooler myself and get it. I stared at her and she stared a me. After sorting that out. We had to find a place to sit. 

First three tables we thought of sitting were dirty and seemed like nobody had bothered to clean them from hours. Luckily the place was not all packed so we did find a table.

The Customer service here is of a typical Indian joint. I have had enough experience of it... to put it in one line, &#34;They will make you feel that they are feeding you for free.&#34;

Then came the food. Quality was below average as all others have said. The disposable forks and spoons that they have are of such a bad quality that it is impossible to break a samosa with them.

The dishes we ordered were Samosa chat, Samosa chhole and Dahi Batata Puri.
Samosa chhole was worst of the three and Dahi Batata Puri was best. But i have had better."

Another item worth mentioning is their Bajra-puris. These are normally kept in the freezer near the entrance. They taste awesome! Ask the person at the counter to pack some chutney that goes with it. They taste even better with their chutney!

When you go to the counter, the person at the counter will sometimes offer you to try something &#34;freshly made&#34;. Whatever it is, do give it a try! More often than not, it will have a superior taste.

The flip-side is the snail-slow processing at the counter. They just can&#39;t move the line fast no matter how long the queue is. The person at the counter will converse with  Gujju customers at length without fail.Good for them-networking and all.Bad for the rest of  us waiting in line.

The saving grace for this restaurant is that its the only Gujarati (Gujarat is a western state in India and its food &amp; language is called Gujarati) restaurant in this area which means its all vegeterian.

First, we walked in and no one was there to seat us. I had to walk around to try to find someone to get us a seat. When we were seated, the table was still dirty. It took our server forever to get to us, take our drinks, bring our food (that&#39;s another story), bring our check...it was a long experience. They brought us salsa with no chips, so we had to ask for those. It was just...a rough night for them I guess.

We finally got drinks and ordered food, and it went even more downhill. The food didn&#39;t all come out at the same time, the orders were wrong, they had to redo our entire order. My tacos were supposed to have pineapple, there was none. I don&#39;t know how much of the night was the kitchen&#39;s fault, and how much it was our server. The food wasn&#39;t really that great (and pretty cold by the time I got around to eating mine).

Our server was new, and we tried to be forgiving of that. The manager did take our food off of the receipt, which was nice (and also why I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1).

We considered ourselves lucky to get a couple of seats at the bar, instead of waiting for the dining room.

I tried the combo fajitas (steak, chicken, shrimp), house margarita &amp; red sangria.

Down-sides:
* Didn&#39;t arrive sizzling. It doesn&#39;t really matter to me, but some people are sticklers about that.

* No complimentary chicken soup with the meal. I didn&#39;t realize this should&#39;ve been included, until after I read a few more reviews afterwards. Minus at least 1.5 stars for that oversight... blame the bartender ??

* Only 3 tortillas initially. This is not much for a huge plate of fajitas. I could order more without add&#39;l charge... but it would&#39;ve been nice, not to have to do that. They are soft, thicker &amp; taste freshly-made.

* Margaritas are on the sour side, which I didn&#39;t care for. Added sangria myself to sweeten it up a bit.

Up-sides:
* LOVED the red sangria ! It&#39;s decently sweet... even though the small apple chunks floating in it are very sour...but at least they made the sangria *look* more authentic ;-j It&#39;s alittle cheaper than a margarita, too.

* The choice of two salsas is a good idea. I preferred the spicy one. As an aside, I can&#39;t tolerate anything very hot. But it was not really that spicy to me, especially if you avoid the small slivers of jalapenos. It was also *much* tastier (more onion, garlic &amp; cilantro) &amp; thicker (not really chunkier, just thicker.. so better for chip dipping) than the mild one.

* The meat &amp; shrimp were some of the best-tasting fajitas I&#39;ve ever had !! Very good char-grilled taste, and sauteed onion &amp; garlic flavor too. Plus alittle &#34;greasy&#34; (for lack of a better word)... in a very good way !

* Shrimp was medium-sized and had a fresh, &#34;sweet&#34; flavor. And at least 5-6 pieces, which is nicely abundant for a combo. Steak was chewy, but tasted great. Chicken was all breast &amp; not too dry. Each one was very tasty !

I will *definitely* be returning for the fajitas &amp; sangria. And maybe try some other menu items as well !!"

The service is so friendly, and I LOVE the outdoor patio seating area. The margaritas are great- not weak like a lot of other Mexican restaurants. Also, the salsa is heads better than other places. It&#39;s fresh, and they bring you a mild type and a spicy type (I recommend the spicy!) They also give you a complimentary soup with your meal which has Mexican spices, meat, and noodles.

I wanted to try out La Magdalena in my local town.  I&#39;ve passed by it so many times, but never had a chance to check it out until recently.
To park your car, you have to go around the building through an alley and into a small parking lot in the back of the building.
As I walked into the place, it was as small and cozy like their parking lot.  I didn&#39;t see a hostess podium, but someone did see us come in and greeted us right away.  They sat us in a booth which I liked.  It was pretty busy on a Saturday night, mostly family and a couple of GNO drinking the night away.  It was a cute establishment, the décor had dark tall wooden chairs and tables and the lighting was dim for dinner lighting, I guess.  The place had a full bar on one side and tables and booths in the other.  They also had some authentic Mexican music playing in the background which got me into the mood, to eat Mexican food of course!
I like when the greeter states her name and welcomed us.  She got our drink orders and then we got a basket of warm crispy chips and fresh spicy salsa.  Our waitress noticed I was stating the salsa was a bit spicy for me that she kindly gave me a milder one.  So remember that you can ask for a milder salsa if you can&#39;t take the heat.
Our meals came with a cup of chicken soup with noodles.  It was good for a cold winter night.
Our food was served quick, nice and hot.  Hubby got the beef cheesy chimichanga made out of ground beef (a deep fried burrito).  I took a piece, it was cheesy and crispy not at all oily.  The beef was also flavorful and he devoured it no more sharing, lol!  I would order that for me next time.  It also came with rice, sour cream, guacamole and refried beans.  
I had a taste for steak fajitas; it came with onions and green peppers sizzling hot.  The steak was soft and juicy not overly cooked, I choose warm corned tortilla vs flour tortilla.  Mine also came with the same sides&#39; guacamole, sour cream, rice and refried beans. However, I wished my steak was a bit more flavorful that I don&#39;t have to put anything on it.  I thought it was kind of bland so I ended up adding salsa for taste. The rice and beans were also not as flavorful as I&#39;d hoped for.  I did like the guacamole fresh and creamy yum.  
Overall, it was a good experience.  I will come back and try other items on the menu, just because I liked the friendly service and it&#39;s so close to the house."

I&#39;m being vague because that can pretty much be ANY week here in the Chi. But anyway, the night we came here we were supposed to get a massive snowstorm. And instead, we got pouring rain, for hours and hours and hours. And people stayed inside because that&#39;s when they do when the weathermen scare them, except for the ones who came to La Magdalena. Because it? Was hoppin&#39;.

My wife was craving Mexican food. I wasn&#39;t that hungry, but figured I&#39;d go along. Our server was super friendly and cheerful. In fact, her attitude made up for the sh*tty weather outside. 

My wife ordered some random combination plate with rice and beans and blahblahblah. I got us an order of queso fundito and the caldo de pollo (chicken soup). The former was brought out to us on one of those skillet plates and set aflame before us. Dripping with oozy cheese and spicy chorizo, we made mini tacos with the fresh flour tortillas (you can have corn) that came with it. It was wonderful. 

Next up was soup. All entrees come with the house chicken noodle soup, even tho it&#39;s not stated on the menu. It&#39;s pretty standard. Nice broth, plenty of noodles. Nothing stand-outish. But good. I&#39;m not quite sure why you get soup when you order a meal of soup, but you do. 

Then our entrees came and quite honestly I was too into mine to even pay attention to what my wife had. Some enchilada/taco nonsense that you can get at any Mexican place. She liked it, but can you be more boring? Please.

My soup came in a huge bowl and there were three full pieces of chicken (with bones) in it. I believe there was a thigh, a leg and half a breast. The broth was reddish and spicy (not hot spicy, just flavorful), and it was full of veggies and noodles. When they say it&#39;s a meal in a bowl, they aren&#39;t kidding. This was wonderful and on a rainy winter night I couldn&#39;t have had a more perfect meal."

It&#39;s the same owners as La Hacienda by the Marcus theaters but this is for the local crowd...not the moviegoers.  A little more intimate...prices are a little better.  Margaritas are terrific.  Chips and salsa are tasty and keep coming.  All meals are preceded by a complimentary cup of soup...simple broth with pasta.  Babies love those noodles!

My favorite meals are the spinach enchiladas, the shrimp fajitas and the skirt steak.  All generous portions and delicious.  Entrees come with your standard rice and refried beans.  These are not favorites of mine so I wish there were alternatives.  Seems a shame to send away so much food untouched.

They&#39;ve recently added a patio area.  I&#39;ve only been out there once and it could be better.  The furniture is comfortable but VERY heavy.  Hard to move even your chair. (UPDATE 07/2014:  They have new furniture that is much better!)  The sun is also a problem and given the western exposure, this isn&#39;t good in the summer.  There is a sort of trellis there but it does nothing to block the sun.  Seating has you right on a busy road (Addison Road) and there&#39;s no view to speak of but that&#39;s not a big deal."

The place was dark and kind of reminded me of a dive bar. Lunch time wasn&#39;t what I expected but they did the best they could. 

The queso was delicious, it had chorizo, green peppers, onions and of course cheese, served with tortillas. The enchiladas were FAB! They sauce was really good but I think next time I wouldn&#39;t get cheese, it was overpowering. The chilaquiles were way too wet and had a lot of ingredients on them, wouldn&#39;t get those again.

We were sat at the bar to wait for an open table. We tried to order margaritas at the bar, but the bartender spoke no English. I get it, were at a Mexican restaurant but likely most customers are not Spanish speaking. It was awkward to say the least, even after pointing at what we wanted on the menu she had to call over what I assume was the manager to get the order. They didn&#39;t offer any margaritas with a gold tequila which I found odd. They wanted to charge more for a gold tequila. The margaritas we ended up weren&#39;t that great.

I grew up going to Ken&#39;s World of Video next door where my dad let me pick out my free kids movie every time we were there and going to the old Pink Pony restaurant where now stands Walgreens. This neighborhood just brings back great memories. 

The food is basic Mexican. Nothing fancy, but just good food. Simple as that. 

The service is pretty decent and the pricing is reasonable. They give you a nice portion of food and their chips are never stale. The salsa, a bit spicy, and their &#34;special red sauce&#34; pretty tasty!

Went for the Enchiladas Suizas and enjoyed the guac and sour cream that came with them (on the side- not on top!). I was more than pleased with the plating. There are a lot of places that do not write on their menu that guac and sour cream are included with the dish and then just slap a pile of this stuff on top of the food. This place actually writes on the menu in the description exactly what accompanies the food. I have an appreciation for this as my fiance hates sour cream and he occasionally is stuck eating food smothered in the stuff after no warning whatsoever. Thank you, writers of the La Mag menu!

I have signed up for their emails so that I can get their emailed coupons and will even recieve a free Birthday Lunch or Dinner Entree around my birthday which you can&#39;t beat with a stick."

The mole chicken had good taste, and there was a lot of chicken - almost too much to finish.  I had a mixed drink which was okay.  The salsa was really good.

My husband introduced me to this place several years ago as it&#39;s one of his favorites. I think it&#39;s partly for nostalgia as its been around so long--he can remember visiting the place with his folks as far back as when he was in junior high. 

The food is solid and I&#39;ve never had a bad entree here. It&#39;s your basic Mexican restaurant. I&#39;ve had tacos, enchiladas and the fajitas here on different occasions and it&#39;s been very good. Fresh ingredients and great sauces/guacomole. Each table receives a basket of crunchy tortilla chips and very tasty salsa. The salsa has a nice kick to it--to me it has good spicy heat--but if you find it too hot for your liking, you can ask for the milder sauce. Each entree comes with a cup of chicken soup--it&#39;s a bit salty for my taste so I usually take a pass on it. 

Their service is wonderful. Always professional and friendly. Recently, I reserved a section of the restaurant for my husband&#39;s surprise birthday dinner party and could not have asked for better service. I visited the restaurant twice before the party to ensure that all was in order. The manager wasn&#39;t there when I made my second visit, but the woman I met with knew exactly where my party was going to be and assured me that the servers would be ready for guests to start ordering drinks while they waited for the guest of honor to arrive. They also allowed us to bring in a cake from a bakery for the celebration without any hassle of a &#34;service fee&#34; that some larger establishments might require. 

This is where the Fernandez Foods restaurants started--La Hacienda and other La Magdalenas are now established in a few other suburbs. This location is smaller than it&#39;s sisters, it&#39;s kind of quaint, not very flashy but definitely an Addison staple."

The shrimp were coated in this delicious red sauce and then pieces of avocado were put on top.. good stuff. Service was great.  We were there with friends and one of them ordered enchiladas. They were great, but after two large horchatas and appetizers my friend decided to take most of his enchiladas home.

Now, I used to live a stones throw away from here many years ago and I have been in this place at least a hundred times over 25+ years and I have finally gotten around to writing a review now.
Something about this place is just so familiar to me, like visiting with a long time friend.

Standard Mexican fare is served here but it is almost always solid, that is why I come back.

They have done some redecorating and added outside seating too.

On to the food..............they always start you off with some tortilla chips along with some pretty decent salsa. I have to be careful here. Very easy to keep eating and eating them.

No margaritas today (too early) but have had them here multiple times and they are always good. Come to think of it, this was probably the first time I have been here without having one.....or two.

Normally, I always get the steak tampiquena which is always excellent but seeing that this was a lunch and I did not want to waddle out of the place, I had tacos El Pastor. Quite nice.
My wife had her usual dish which is a shrimp soup that comes loaded with shrimp. I have tasted this many times and it is always nice.

Service is good with long time servers attending to your needs.

If you are ever in the mood or the neighborhood and have a taste for some solid Mexican fare, give them a try. There is a reason that they have been open for over 30 years.

Where to start...?

Drinks:
I wanted a Margarita. Lime Juice, Orange Liqueur, Tequila. I didn&#39;t want some sweet &#39;n&#39; sour mix laden liquid, I wanted a Margarita. So, they had just the thing, however it was $8 - fair enough, you get what you pay for. So I ask if I could get it in the form of a pitcher, to which the response was a curt/cold no. &#34;I see you have specialty drinks for $9 and a pitcher for $31, perhaps I could just pay the specialty drink rate and you can make this happen?&#34; to which the response was a curt/cold no. So, let me get this straight, you won&#39;t sell me a drink at higher than the advertised price - okay, just making sure?

Then when the drink arrives, there is no salt on the rim of the glass. Not because I asked for no salt, just because they failed, and failed to ask if I wanted any salt.  

Oh, and I had to ask to get a refill on my water, which they forgot till the end of the meal. 
-------------------------------

Food:
I ordered a Chicken Torta, which wasn&#39;t great, and wasn&#39;t terrible. The steak fries that came with my Torta was probably the best part of the meal. 

Oh, and like the water refill, I asked for napkins when the food came out which didn&#39;t arrive till after my plate was taken away.
--------------------------------

Scenery:
We decided to eat outside, big mistake. We are about 10ft from the main road, and our view was graced with the beautiful Walgreens sign."

I&#39;m not sure what took me so long. It was always just &#34;that Mexican restaurant next to Ken&#39;s Adult Toys&#34;. 

Their food is great. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a bad meal there. Last time I had the Enchiladas Verdes, chicken enchiladas covered in a green sauce. At many other establishments, the chicken enchiladas are more fixin than chicken. This ratio was actually perfect. They don&#39;t overwhelm you with sides, but the tortilla chips and salsa are never ending. The chips, I have to say, are perfectly crispy and they don&#39;t break my fillings. Bad tortilla chips can ruin a Mexican food experience, in my opinion. 

I have to give special mention to the margaritas. It&#39;s hard to screw up a margarita, but it&#39;s also hard to make a good one. La Magdalena is above average. A shot of tequila later, and my night was complete. I live in Chicago, but I would drive to Addison just for La Magdalena."

The one thing that I think Magdalena has going for it is awesome drinks. They have a Chambord Margarita that is amazing. Last time we went I ordered the white sangria, and it blew my mind. It was filled with apples (unusual for sangria), and it was very cider-y like. It was amazing.

The food is ok. I typically order the fajitas, and the BF orders the chilaquiles. Nothing memorable here. The soup that comes with the meal is way too salty.

So as far as the food I love their hot salsa and thick crispy chippies they give you start off with,but hat the fact that you get a tiny water glass that doesnt get filled up enough to calm my burning tongue. I usually get the veggie fajitas that are actually pretty good just a lil greasy.


My daddy thinks the owners special is the greatest mexican meal ever so if you are a meat eater you should try it.It looks cheesey!"

Their salsa is good, quite a kick.  But, everything else we tried was more bland and dry than I had expected.  I loved the ambience of the restaurant, but probably won&#39;t go back...unless my Mother&#39;s in the mood for &#34;mexican,&#39; as she isn&#39;t one for spicy foods."

It is a great place for good traditional Mexican food.  The salsa is amazing. I have many favorite dishes; the Caldo de Res, the
enchiladas, the flautas are my cant go wrong standbys!  I will say their mole is not my favorite mole sauce.  

I like the feel of La Magdalena&#39;s.  It is low lit with music in the background.  La Magdalena&#39;s offers a nice casual dining experience.  Oh and the RITAS are great! Good for groups up to 6.

Strangely, La Hacienda down the street is owned by the same people, but I prefer La Magdalena&#39;s for it&#39;s atomsphere!"

My boyfriend and I have made it &#34;our&#34; restaurant, it&#39;s mostly quiet, the drinks are strong, the food is always solid.  If you want it loud with a crowd and lots of fancy ambiance, hit up La Ha down Lake Street.  This place very chill by contrast.  After a stressful day we can show up, sit in a tall-backed booth and talk over nice strong martinis, margaritas, coladas, whatever, it&#39;s always good here.  I always see some guys at the bar watching futbol, it adds to the authenticity a lot.  The soup before dinner is most excellent, better than my grandma&#39;s actually.  My favorite dish is the flautas or the enchiladas suizas, never ever a let down.  I always find coupons for this restaurant, too, so that&#39;s also a plus.  More drinks in that case.  :)"

I decided to go somewhere local, so I took her to La Magdalena Restaurant in Addison, Il. This establishment has been in Addison, Il. for over 20 years. The restaurant is decorated in an Aztec type of design. There is a bar with bar seating , booths and table seating. I prefer seating in the raised dinning room which is more private. They had frozen Margaritas for $3.99, which were good. They serve the classic Nacho&#39;s with Pico De Gallo. My Mother and I both had a beef taco Combination Plate. It included One beef taco, one bean tostada, one tamale and cheese enchilada. The tamale wrapped in the corn husk was outstanding. The cheese enchilada was very good. The restaurant also serves Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Homemade Tamales, Flautas, Fajitas, Camarones, Pollo, Steak, Enchiladas and Ensaladas -Salads. On Mondays and Tuesday nights they have Margarita Madness.  Friends can sit in the lounge, listen to the juke box and enjoy Margaritas all night. Our server &#34; Leo&#34; was excellent. For good Mexican Food at reasonable prices I say give this place a shot. If you want take-out food this is also the place. For good frozen Margaritas its good. (:"

This is probably one of the only places (other than Millie&#39;s Pancake House) that has been in Addison for as long as I can remember.  I never thought people outside of Addison knew about this place, but apparently it has a following outside of town - which explains why it is still there - next to Ken&#39;s video, cranking out consistent, quality food.  It doesn&#39;t have the fancy-schmancy decor like Hacienda Dos Fernandez over by the Marcus, but it is homey and quaint."

It was just 3 of us. It was around 5ish pm and as we walked in we were greeted by the doorman/greater in opening the door. As we walked in we noticed pretty empty as expected at that time. This my first time at the Chicago Prime dinning but it was very pleasant one. I consider this place a $$$ not a $$ so that&#39;s even more awesome that from the food, staff, service, decor etc is all worth more $$$ yet it&#39;s not. 

FOOD - They have a smaller but not tiny menu. Although not huge i was still stuck on what to order. I knew i wanted pasta for sure so i asked our server for her opinion. She directed me kindly to 3 choices. I forgot the name of the food :( but it was pasta with a vodka style sauce. However i was sad that it&#39;s plain pasta and no meat which they give you option to add meat to it. I added shrimp however i was sad it only came with 3 jumbo shrimps for $9. They start you off with bread which is so yummy. Of course the oil and parmesan. Salad or soup is pretty much included with all meals. We all ordered a salad. Which was delicious....We also ordered a appetizer of Louisiana crab cakes. It was only 2 good sized cakes with sauce on side that tasted great and arugula, which they added something to it that tasted amazing i just can&#39;t put my finger on it. The food was well presented on the plate also. 

DECOR/ATMOSPHERE -  The place overall is very classy and more formal looking. They have a small outside eating area that looks cute and more casual. I enjoyed the small entrance as well it&#39;s nice and the bathrooms were also cute. 

$$$ - As i mentioned above i believe this place is $$$ not $$ but can&#39;t complain!!! 

STAFF/SERVICE - Staff all were very polite. Their attire is also of a $$$ restaurant and not $$. Our server was great. She even gave us a few compliments and was helpful and attentive. Service all in all was amazing. From the attitude to the timing."

The dinner was an early one, beginning at 5 and the crowd could be of the hard to please variety. That being said, notwithstanding our early arrival and our inability to get into the room right away and prior to the arrival of our guests, it was a lovely evening at a comfortably casually chic Italian themed restaurant.

Service was just a bit slow to start off - possibly due to the early timing with the last table being set up as our guests were arriving. But the room was set up beautifully for our small crowd of just under 30. All of the wait staff were cordial &amp; professional with a special thanks to Brittany, Tamar and Joe who handled each request in a timely and pleasant fashion. In making arrangements I dealt with their event coordinator, Lisa L., who was also helpful and professional offering me suggestions along the way..

We were all pleased with the food, from the bruschetta to the green beans to the  filet steaks and chicken francese to the dessert platter and everything in between. Their cannolli was some of the best I have tasted!  During and after our event we heard lots of praise for the venue, the food and the wait staff.

I would not hesitate to use this restaurant again or to visit for any occasion, including a nice family or romantic dinner. It gets busy so plan accordingly.

Kudos to all at Chicago Prime Italian and thanks for making our event a special one!"

The inside is very formal/classy, the outside is more fun/casual. We opted to sit outside. They had a live singer outside which was a great added touch. Since it is in the suburbs, the demographics was mostly an older, pretentious looking crowd. But everyone was really nice/ friendly and having a blast on their patio!

For food, we got Brick Chicken (takes 30 mins, order early), Chicken Parm, and Chicken Alfredo, Tiramisu, and Creme Brule.
- Brick Chicken: kind of flavorless. The sauce on the side was very watery and not very flavorful.
- Chicken Parm: decent portion but definitely not worth $25!! What a rip-off for chicken parm with some basic penne w/ marinara sauce on the side.
- Chicken Alfredo: good, but again lacking flavor/salt.
- Tiramisu: delicious, no major complaints
- Creme Brule: the top sugar crust was not warm as it should&#39;ve been.. so probably made in advance. skip.

Overall, cute ambiance for the burbs, live music is great, but the food lacks flavor and is WAY too expensive for what you get. Meh."

I added crumbled Italian sausage which had a lot of flavor. Service was good,  although the food took a bit long to come out, but once I tried the pasta, all was forgiven.  I could tell the pasta was made from scratch, so it was well worth the wait. Portions are huge...think family style. This seems like a great date spot.

I live only a mile or so from here and have been curious about it, but just never stopped by. When he suggested it, I jumped at the opportunity.

First, I disagree with the $$ rating. It should be $$$. But, considering the service and the quality of the foods, I do think it was worth the extravagance.

I would classify this as an old style Italian restaurant. Darkly lit, white linen tablecloths, waiters dressed formally. Service was outstanding as was the meal.

Highly recommended."

They have delicious martinis, I had the key lime pie martini which was delicious but very strong. The second. I had was the Starburst martini, it was a tasty layer of blue and red with a cherry at the bottom. 

They serve complimentary bread. It smelled and tasted soooo fresh. As an appetizer we ordered some type of shrimp (not the cocktail but this was breaded with butter dressing) it was pretty good. 

As an entrée I had the eggplant Parmesan. Amazing but a large portion served with a side of pasta, also a big portion. It was filling but very good food.

As a dessert we ordered the cannoli, there&#39;s two and they&#39;re huge! Plan to share!"

Came with a group of 6 for a birthday dinner and I thought the dining room itself was gorgeous. It looks like a good venue for a rehearsal dinner but it was fairly empty (Wednesday night at 7pm). Our waitress was sweet and checked on us several times. Most of our party ordered some variance of pasta, I ordered the BBQ ribs (on special) and my husband ordered the salmon.

8-FINGER CAVATELLI = the only dish that was finished. the texture was great and the sauce was a solid marinara
RIGATONI VODKA = awesome sauce. basic but good
FUSILLI CARBONARA = my mom said it was too salty but I felt it was bland compared to a true Italian Carbonara. The sauce was too thin for my taste.
SPAGHETTI &amp; MEATBALLS = the meatballs were juicy and flavorful. seems Chicago Prime is good at the basics.
SALMON = decent. he ordered a side of the mushrooms which were well seasoned.
BBQ RIBS = gross. the sauce did not mask the smell of the pork which already made my stomach churn a bit. I had about 3 of them before I decided I wasn&#39;t hungry anymore. On top of the bad taste I spent a lot of time in the bathroom once I arrived home. On the plus side the fries were awesome (double-fried).

Maybe the steaks are much better but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back anytime soon to test that theory out."

My family and I ordered an appetizer and shortly thereafter our dinners with salads.  After the bread and appetizer were gone we waited interminably for our salad.  No bread refill was ever offered.

When the salad did come it was very disappointing -- a supermarket bag salad with a ladle of dressing.

Again we waited for over an hour for dinner.  The food was above average - risotto had good flavor, pasta and chicken dishes held up well.

In all, we spent more than 90 minutes waiting for the next course, and not with attentive service.  We were not in the mood to spend and more time for coffee or dessert.

With so many very good Italian places in the NW suburbs, I&#39;d recommend skipping Chicago Prime Italian."

First time here and we felt we were part of a family. The food was great. Especially the fried calamari appetizer and the Calabrese Pork Chops which were to die for.  Excellent bread and chilled glasses. I tasted the Salmon Risotto and I must say, it was the best I ever tasted. We also ordered Zuppa Di Mare and Chicken Prosciutto. Both of which were excellent. I believe their soups were rather bland. Soups didn&#39;t reflect their main courses. 

We met the manager. He seemed pleasant and modest. He won&#39;t be loosing any sleep in knowing we would be recommending this place to others.  Nice, very nice place. Professional. 

One other thing I feel I should mention. The suggested gratuity amount on our food bill was wrong. They totaled up our tax with our food bill when tabulating for the 18%, 20%, and 25% suggested gratuity. For a couple it&#39;s no big deal but it&#39;s certainly worth noting for a large food and drink tab for 7 people. I pointed this out to our waitress but it didn&#39;t seem to faze her.

There was not much of a crowd there, but I was impressed.  The food was outstanding.  I had a deconstructed eggplant parmesan dish that was great.  The service was fine.  I sat in the bar, and for some weird reason they had the TV on really loud, and I had to hear Donald Trump bark for a while.  After he shut up, a local musician played an acoustic set.  That was cool."

When we made our reservation, we checked to make sure that their regular menu would be available, as none of us want a huge buffet lunch.  Both the website and a sign outside said the regular menu would be available.   We waited for our table, ordered our drinks, and only THEN did they say that only the buffet was available due to &#34;a problem in the kitchen&#34;.  As we were already seated, we decided to stay, but we wish we hadn&#39;t.  (They also didn&#39;t tell us that champagne drinks were included with the brunch until after we&#39;d already ordered wine.)   

The restaurant isn&#39;t configured to handle a buffet well - huge lines of people for the buffet were snaked back through the restaurant waiting for food, so even those who were seated had people standing right next to them and couldn&#39;t enjoy a relaxing lunch.  And the buffet food was mediocre at best.   We won&#39;t be back."

My waiter was Marco and he was very attentive even though having more than a few other tables. I wasn&#39;t really hungry, but he seemed very knowledgable about the menu and insisted I try something. I got the garlic butter breaded clams and they were superb! It actually was perfect since I didn&#39;t want to eat a whole meal, but went hand in hand with my drink, something tasty to nibble on. Great experience here, will come back with friends for a full course meal. But now I have very high expectations for this place, as the waiter I had made my visit exquisite.

I have had terrible experiences with chain restaurants losing my reservation and not doing anything to accommodate the guests that I have there. With CPI. The experience is completely different. You feel VIP with them and they do all that they can to ensure a flawless experience. On top of that, the food is absolutely to die for. From the warm bread to the perfectly mixed drinks, the indulgent pasta and the fabulous desserts, you will leave feeling like royalty.

We were immediately seated as there were many open tables. We ordered the mussels as an appetizer. The sauce was great but the mussels themselves were not washed well--there was so much sand that it was almost unbearable to eat. I had the chicken caprese, which was HUGE. I was able to eat the leftovers for 3-4 additional meals. Our waiter seemed new since he appeared puzzled every now and then. He was really nice and brought my mom a free dessert when he found out it was her birthday. There was live music playing near the bar but the music was a hit or miss (there was one girl singing who sounded like she was screaming). Overall, my experience at Chicago Prime Italian was okay.

I am in town for work and I always try to find restaurants that are a bit different than the same old chain restaurants you always find in the suburbs. I saw this place had good reviews and was close to my hotel so I decided to check it out. When I was there I got the sense that the staff worked really hard and really cared about the food and service! My waitress was wonderful and gave great suggestions and even remembered my name which is just a small thing but when you&#39;re alone at a restaurant it makes you feel like you matter as a customer! I ordered the ceaser salad to start which was delicious, then the chicken caprese for my main dish, the portion was huge and I couldn&#39;t even finish half of it but the food was light and fresh. The owner of the restaurant stoped by to check in and he was so friendly and funny as well. I ended up having the salted caramel mousse cake for dessert which was so tasty!

What a mistake!!
Our waiter came and took our drink order... He didn&#39;t come back for over 20 minutes!! One of the drink orders was a glass of white Zinfandel and he came back and said they ran out and it would be a few more minutes to bring that because they needed to open a new bottle...
At that point we were like forget this place!! If it takes this long to order drinks .. We are definetly going to pay $50 a plate for bad service!! Who knows how long it would take to get out entrees... 
He finally brought the white Zinfandel out after another 15 minutes and said the manager would come out to apologize... We waited another 15 minutes and no manager... By this time we were starving and literally got up and walked out...

The pros: nice ambiance, friendly bartender, delicious bread, generous servings, nice wine list, decent food (somethings great! others just okay). The cons: a group of eight having food come out over the course of 9-10 minutes, a fairly rude waitress coming across as if providing service is an annoyance (and a stand in during what must have been break time be even less friendly), a chipped water glass knicking my lip, very disappointing creme brulee which clearly wasn&#39;t set yet was placed on the table despite being clearly runny. (It was removed from the check, and the table, after a complaint was made.)
Overall --- disappointing. The food really was overall good. Based on the food alone, this would rank 4 to 4.5 stars. The annoyed service and staggered serving time of the food bring it down significantly."

First, let me say Pedro, the bus boy was amazing. He was far more efficient and accommodating to our party than our actual &#34;server.&#34;
Our reservations had been made 2 months in advance, indicating that our group would be large(20.) We were seated at 7:15. Orders were placed (apps, salads, dinner) all by 7:30. 
One appetizer order was never submitted to the kitchen. Even after inquiring we were assured it took longer because they were mussels. Then the manager came out, apologized &amp; told us they forgot to put it in. 8:15 we finally get the ONE missing appetizer, which apparently held up the salads too. Our dinner wasn&#39;t served until 9:40 pm!
That is maddening! I ordered the caprese chicken...god awful for $25. Dry &amp; flavorless. Sides came out after the entree on a few of our friends. To top it off...the server was passive, rude &amp; completely unapologetic. 
If the restaurant couldn&#39;t accommodate the large party they should have denied the reservations or be prepared w/necessary staff members. 
Stars were for Pedro! 
No I wouldn&#39;t go back or recommend. I&#39;ll take my business across the road to Maggianos. Save your time &amp; money."

I&#39;m so glad I waited to post my review because since then I&#39;ve gone again &amp; again &amp; again! And each time since my initial visit has been fantastic.

On my initial visit we felt like our waiter didn&#39;t want us to be there and wasn&#39;t very interested in service. However every time we&#39;ve gone to Chicago Prime Italian since then, we&#39;ve had excellent service. A couple servers in particular are very attentive and friendly.

I&#39;ve now tried a wide variety of dishes including their lunch time buffet so let me break it all down.
Chicken Prosciutto for $14. I was surprised it came with pasta and such a decently sized portion. I was a bit let down that the chicken was billed as chicken prosciutto and having had a similar dish at other restaurants in which the chicken was wrapped in prosciutto or stuffed with it - this dish was chicken covered in mushrooms, onions and chopped up tiny pieces of prosciutto. I liked the dish but it just wasn&#39;t exactly what I was expecting. 
Salmon Salad $15 - Huge chunks of perfectly cooked salmon with great flavor. Huge salad in general lined with hard boiled eggs &amp; tomatoes. Loaded with olives, as well. Loved everything about this salad!
Lunch buffet  $15 - Their buffet includes many items including caprese salad, meatballs, potatoes, chicken dishes, eggplant dishes, calamari, fruit and dessert! If you haven&#39;t been to Chicago Prime before it may be a good starting point for you.
Chicken Pesto Wrap - This is a great dish if you&#39;re looking for something a little lighter but even this is quite a big portion. Chicken is cooked perfectly and everything goes together quite well in this dish.

Chicago Prime Italian is just a couple minutes from my company so it&#39;s turned into a regular lunch spot for coworkers and myself. Their menu is quite expansive so I think they could benefit from trimming it down just a bit to focus on the dishes they offer that are truly amazing. Also, they need to update their website so it properly reflects their offerings. They don&#39;t list many of their lunch items including wraps &amp; sandwiches online which may deter people from visiting in the afternoon."

I returned to Chicago Prime Italian food the first time since my initial review. 

What a difference!  The service was outstanding.  The wait staff was very attentive without being smothering.  And the food was outstanding.  The menu is the same as my previous review.  I never had a problem with the food. 

This will be my regular Italian restaurant from this point forward. Highly recommended. 

Original review:
The poor rating is due to the extremely slow service.  The food was really very good. 

The interior is unchanged from when this was the Schaumburg Rosebud. But the menu is very different. While the offerings are less interesting than Rosebud, typical Italian dishes are well represented.  The preparation is excellent and the presentation is OK. Except for the pathetic side salad which was very limp and uninteresting. 

But the service, at least on this night, was so pathetic that it completely spoiled the dining experience. And it may just have been the fault of our waiter, who had to recheck the drink order twice and had to return to check the food order a second time as well. For some reason he was unable to write the order down and tried to rely on a shaky memory.   I MIGHT be willing to try the restaurant one more time, but would walk out if this were again the server. 

So, try the place. You&#39;ll like the food, but make sure you don&#39;t have anywhere else to be."

To be honest, initially my expectations were set pretty low as there were several mixed reviews and the pictures on Yelp didn&#39;t look too promising. I have to say from the service to the menu everything was sensational. It&#39;s simply your most classic Italian restaurant with great bread and pastas. The bread is so warm with just the right amount of fluffy and crunchy-add some cheese and olive oil it&#39;s just perfection. I highly recommend any pasta dish you can get your hands on. For myself I loved the riggatoni with vodka sauce and chicken-divine! My friends had the veal parmesan, cheese ravioli, and a classic spaghetti with marinara sauce. No complaints whatsoever. The service was great as well. Our waiter was super friendly and tending to our needs as much as possible. We did wait a little longer towards the end to get our check but even then it was appreciated as we were all taking our time to chat. I loved the ambiance of Chicago Prime. Super classy with dim lighting overall romantic-perfect for a date or special occasion. Great place, great food, and great service-can&#39;t go wrong"

I normally do not leave reviews but if you have a couple like my boyfriend and I who wanted to give it a shot and have a romantic dinner, I want to warn you first.  
We arrived to the restaurant,  disappointed there wasn&#39;t any valet, but that didn&#39;t ruin our night. We entered the restaurant and two women were standing directly in front of the hostess stand. We thought they were customers because they were dressed in regular clothes. The actual hostess had to move to look around them and ask for our name. She then gave one of the women who was standing there our menus and told her where to take us. We waited a good 10 to 20 seconds for her to finish her conversation with her friend before she finally turned around, acknowledged us, and took us to a table. 

Our server came and was nice. I ordered Moscato and he ordered an apple martini (which we later sent back because it was TOO strong and tasted bad...we never send drinks back). We ordered minestrone soup and meatballs for our appetizers.  The soup was delicious, but the meatballs were not. As I mentioned, my boyfriend is a chef and his best dish is meatballs, so we like trying them wherever we go. They were some of the worst ones we have ever tasted. The sauce was good, a simple sauce, but sometimes less is more. For our meals I ordered fettuccine alfredo. It was good, nothing special. My boyfriend ordered veal parmesan.  He said it wasn&#39;t the worst, but it has too much cheese (coming from a cheese lover), was soggy, and didn&#39;t have the best flavor. We weren&#39;t completely disappointed with our meals, but I&#39;ve had better food at maggianos. Another disappointing thing was as the restaurant began to fill up, more and more couples were coming in wearing jeans and sneakers. I was expecting a fine dining experience but was dining with other couples who looked like they were at Applebee&#39;s.  (This disappointed me mostly because of my expectations and that it was not the experience I wanted for valentine&#39;s day). It was also VERY cold. We were uncomfortable the entire time. 

After dinner we passed on getting dessert.  We decided to try to enjoy a few drinks at the bar. We paid our bill and went to the bar. There were only 2 open seats since they were busy at this point. The seats were not beside one another so my boyfriend asked the male bartender if it would be okay to move the seats together. The bartender replied with &#34;if you can find something&#34; in a tone like we were bothering him. 

.....Okay then! my boyfriend brushed it off and we got our seats together. As we were sitting down he asked the female bartender for a drink menu. She was an older female, light brown hair if I remember correctly.  She turned around grabbed two menus and then proceeded to toss them onto the bar in front of us. If we wouldn&#39;t have caught them, they would have slid right onto the floor. She didn&#39;t look at us, let us know she will come back, nothing. THIS is what sealed the deal and ruined our experience.  We were shocked by her behavior. Both bartenders were rude. Busy or not, this is not acceptable. We can pay high-end prices somewhere else with better service. We got up to leave immediately and she returned and asked if we changed our minds. My boyfriend was trying his hardest to not let anything ruin our time so he simply said yes, we changed our mind. She then proceeds to say &#34;you know if you turn the menu over it has a back too&#34;. Excuse me??? She must have thought we looked stupid. My boyfriend replies, &#34;actually we didn&#39;t even read the menu. We are not happy with the bad attitude we have been given&#34;. She looked confused (I&#39;m sure she was very confised, she must treat lots of people this way and doesn&#39;t even realize how rude she is). She didn&#39;t apologize. She questioned us saying &#34;what attitude? Did I say something?&#34; And my boyfriend said it&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fine and we got our coats. She started asking the other customers seated around us if she had an attitude, still not apologizing to us. 

My boyfriend chose not to complain to the manager because it was valentine&#39;s day and we didn&#39;t want to ruin it even more than it already had been. If it were any other day, we would have immediately asked for the owner. 

You simply do not give off the impression of fine dining and then allow people with everyday clothes come in, offer below average food, AND have staff with bad attitudes. 

We will never get our first valentine&#39;s day together back. It was supposed to be special, and we were so excited. Now we only have a bad experience to look back on."

The bread was hot and delicious.

But were quickly disappointed. One good thing is that we were seated promptly at our reservation time. It all went downhill from there. It was difficult to hold a conversation due to the noise level. Our drinks took 27 mins to arrive. Salads were very simple, nothing exciting about a house salad especially when the ice berg lettuce were brown around the edges. Once we ordered our entrees we never saw our server until the entrees arrived 63 mins later. Yes, funny I do time the length it takes our cocktails and entrees to arrive. I ordered Chilean Sea Bass, which I love. But my was over buttered and a bit salty. I would have told my server but she never returned. My friend had the spaghetti and meatballs and throughly enjoyed it. Our server finally returned with a slice of tiramisu for the birthday boy, but never coordinated the time when she would bring it out, so we missed the opportunity to sing him happy birthday since half the table was either in the bathroom or having a smoke break. I&#39;m sad to say that we will not be returning."

(Mothers day) because we had a few people in the party who were late they made my poor mom wait by the door where it was freezing. They refused to seat us until we all arrived. Then we had to walk around the bar to get our food which was a buffet. Honestly heard great things about this place but the buffet was no good and we were super disappointed. $200 a couple turned out to be a huge downer. It is too bad because it deters us from returning on a normal business day.

We have never dined here before and were a bit unsure how it would go.  Upon arriving the building was beautiful outside and in, very welcoming from the get go.  We had a 7pm reservation and noticed that we might be a few minutes late on our way in.  I gave the restaurant a call and was told not to worry we would be taken care of.  That seemed to be the theme of the night as the owner greeted and showed us to our table talking with us and making us feel at home.  

Once at our table, our server was prompt to get our drink order and explain the menu to us.  He mentioned that he used to work in the kitchen and is now serving and had a very detailed description and knowledge of each dish.  At a first glance there was a bit of sticker shock with the prices but every dish we enjoyed was above and beyond my expectations.  My wife had the Lasagna, a huge piece of an Italian classic that was to die for.  I had the Veal Marsala that was out of this world.  The Veal was cooked perfectly and the rich marsala mushroom sauce paired well with each bite.  Both my wife and I enjoyed one of if not the best caesar side salads we have had in a long time eating out.  To round out the night we enjoyed the Tiramisu and Cheesecake, both generous in size and outstanding in flavor.  

Being a Chef in the industry it is hard to find a nice place to enjoy a great dinner.  Our experience tonight at Chicago Prime Italian was an unforgettable night and we will definitely be back.  We also look forward to the opportunity to trying out the restaurants sister location Chicago Prime Steak.  This Father Son restaurant duo is doing a great job and I wish the best for them with the new year and many more to come.

OK so you&#39;re fine dining but I have to fight with paper on my table like I&#39;m at a picnic, if I spill some oil OK change the cloth I spend over a hundred dollars you can&#39;t afford to get you linen cleaned, secondly my salad was way over dressed I know most people don&#39;t mind extra dressing; but if it&#39;s balsamic you don&#39;t want wilted lettuce and no flavor it was a shame I was going out with my wife and the in laws I was ashamed... then to top it off the waiter Pedro was very unattentive I might as not have even been there it was ridiculous, then the entrée came and for the decor and just the whole ambiance I&#39;m not impressed. Then the food just to be honest. I ordered the de Mar dish... all of the seafood was frozen then cooked.... and how is that fresh.... nasty... I promise you it was a very big disappointment so after over a hundred dollars for me and my wife whose pasta had been sitting in the heated window and was no longer saucy but just a big blob of stiff hard sauce. I would never go back to that place.... p.s. I am an executive chef and I would never let that stuff come out of my kitchen so sorry but I&#39;m just really disappointed"

One thing that the Schaumburg restaurant scene has been missing is a quality Italian place and CPI fills the hole very nicely. We started with drinks at the bar which were made quite well, had an old fashion (made correctly). We then move to the dinning room for dinner. Our server was pleasant, knowledgable and attentive. I actually had a difficult time deciding what to order because knowing the reputation I wanted to try a lot of items. 

Got a Caesar salad which was fantastic. As simple as a Caesar salad is not many people do it right and this was spot on. Main course I got the chicken parm. Two large chicken filets and a side of pasta. Like with most Italian places the portion sizes are large so expect to take home leftovers!  No dessert for us tonight but a great experience. Decor is nice and everything you&#39;d expect from a high end restaurant. They have an amazing deck area which we did not take advantage of but looks first class.

The folks from Chicago Prime steakhouse in Schaumburg have done a great job with their latest restaurant, Chicago Prime Italian.
They have taken over the location of the former Rosebud restaurant and the changes are all for the better.
We had the opportunity to to sample the Rosebud menu before they folded up shop and frankly, it was tired.  The same old trite enormous portions of mediocre food.

The new Chicago Prime Italian has reworked the menu with a lot of standards with better execution, along with some really interesting new takes.

We started with the bacon wrapped scallops.  I commented that these may have been the best I&#39;ve had, including my own.  The scallops were done perfectly, not over or under cooked, the most common problem, and the bacon was crispy without being charred.  
As noted above, excellent execution.

We followed that with a recommendation from our waitress, Melissa; the Eggplant Salad.
Be prepared, this thing is huge and could easily be a nice shareable appetizer for 3 or 4 people.  Thin slices of eggplant covered in breadcrumbs and deep fried, stacked with tomato, mozzarella and arugula then lightly touched with a balsamic glaze.
It was fantastic.  My initial thought was that it would that heavy, soggy fried eggplant like you get in eggplant parm.. but it was anything but.  The eggplant was light, crispy on the outside and wonderfully tender inside.  The balsamic glaze was the perfect accent to round out the other flavors.

We went for the Sea Bass as our entree.  Most of the fish and I assume the chicken and veal dishes can be made a variety of ways.  We chose the &#34;fresca&#34; (I may have that wrong) for our sea bass.  Lightly sauteed with fresh tomato and other veggies over the top.  Very fresh and light, which is exactly what we were looking for.
The fish itself was cooked just right and the fresca salsa was a nice addition to brighten up the whole thing.

Lastly, our waitress, Melissa, was truly impressive.  She was attentive without hovering or being overbearing.  She had solid recommendations based on what we were looking for and she split the plates right at the table for us.  Clearly, the Chicago Prime focus on exceptional service has carried over to the new place as well.

I&#39;m happy to see the Rosewood dinosaur replaced by a family who really has passion about their restaurants, their menu and their clientele.
It&#39;s an experience and a pleasure to eat at Chicago Prime Italian.
We&#39;ll definitely be back soon."

2 stars. 1 for the bruschetta and one for the tiramisu &amp; bread pudding. That was the only redemption.

I finally decided on my meal. Brick Chicken. I was told it would take 30 min to prepare. Oh well, guess I&#39;ll just have to endure good cocktails and great music. The dish was simple yet fantastic. Juicy and flavourful. I would definitely get it again. With all the choices on the menu it was hard to decide. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner AJ.

The service was terrible and the food was okay. I had a lunch reservation at 2pm to take my parents out for lunch.  When I got there I was seated immediately which was good.  Our waiter did not offer us any drinks other than water. He took our order a few minutes later and they gave us bread, olive oil and parmesan but no plates to mix the olive oil and parmesan. We waited for about 5mins and we were able to call out a busboy to grab us some.  We order calamari and it was served right after the bread but they did not give us new plates as our plates had olive oil and parmesan already on them. We waited again for another 5mins to get new plates from another busboy not our waiter. While we waited my water was empty with no waiter in sight for a refill as I again had to find another busboy to fill my glass.  Thirty minutes later a manager came to us and told us that there was only one prime rib left as my father and I both ordered them so I had to pick another entree that was comparable. Remember this is in the middle of the afternoon and also thirty minutes later. How do you run out of prime rib in the middle of the day? Its like the grocery store running out milk????? Our food came 45mins after we were seated and my mothers entree was more oil that actual food. She hated her entree.  I was finally able to reach the owner and told him about our experience and he was very apologetic and offered me a family discount which I was thankful for. As I received my bill, the discount was only $8????? Family discount??? WOW!! Insulting! My bill after my tip was $200 and I got a $8 discount for my experience.  It know its not alot of money but give me a &#34;family discount&#34; I would of rather gotten a free dessert.  Thank you but no thank you! This will be my first and last visit!!"

The veal marsala, 3 good-sized flattened slices, was tender and covered richly with a slightly sweet sauce, and smothered in mushrooms. Very delicate and enjoyable. It came with a side of pasta. The specials menu had a scallop-over-pasta dish with dried tomatoes (very tender) and broccoli. Another winner, and a generous portion. A list of vegetable sides was available at extra cost, but we did not try them. The wine, a pleasant Chateau St Jean cabernet, had just enough &#34;oak&#34; to please without overloading the delicate flavored entrees.

Dinners run from about $15 to $45, and sides add about $9. Wines begin about at $7.

Our server Marco was cordial, pleasant and capable. The bar in the next room was huge and very busy. Decor and facilities were pleasant and clean. Valet pkg. available.

Our only disappointment was that the place was extremely noisy once it filled up. It seems like one can hear everyone else in the room talking at once. That can become tiring and can push you to get up and leave, which I guess is the reason it is that way. We would prefer a quieter time or place.

The Chicago Prime Steakhouse a few miles north (same ownership) is also a nice place to dine, but has more of a quiet, intimate feeling."

Well, I&#39;m happy to report that we all came away feeling full and satisfied.
When we first approached, the lot was packed full so we decided to valet.
Once inside, we encountered a bit of congestion as they had several large groups to sit.  
Overall, we only had to wait 7 minutes past our reservation time which we were okay with.A slight hiccup but nothing I would take points away for as we&#39;ve encountered much worse.We simply adjourned to the bar to watch some college football and the time flew by.
Once we sat down, everything was in place and they quickly took our drink order. Warm bread arrived shortly and we were well on our way to a successful evening.
Looking around, the décor looks familiar and feels very comfortable. 
They took our orders and got everything the way we&#39;d requested it.
The service was outstanding. Our waitress was very pleasant as well as helpful. 
I enjoyed a huge New York Portobello strip steak with and my significant other the Rigatoni with vodka sauce. Not the absolute best but very good nonetheless. 
Portions are fairly large so you may end up taking some home with you.
Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert
Yes, we would consider coming back again.
Another successful dining experience"

My husband had the chicken vesuvio and loved it.  I am vegetarian and asked if they could make me a dinner of roasted vegetables although it was not on the menu.  The waiter said yes and came back with a beautiful dish of roasted vegetables with a carved tomato stuffed with bread crumbs in the center.
It was outstanding.  The bread is also very good.  We also ordered bruschetta which was excellent.  The waiter was very attentive and kept checking back on us to see if we needed anything and to see if we liked it.  The manager also went to the tables and asked how people liked their meal. The front room was kind of noisy though so we will ask for the back room next time."

The honey flank steak is very tasty and has a nice crisp on the outside coating that I look for in a Asian protein dish. The sushi is tasty as well. I love the yellow tail and spicy salmon.

I have seen this place many times in the years I have lived here, but, hadn&#39;t yet tried it until today.  I thought it was more one of those take out only style restaurants so I went in to order some take out.  To my surprise it is a very nicely setup restaurant.  Not huge, but a nice atmosphere in the main dining area; also, it seems they have a private area for groups.  I ordered a drink and made a takeout order for orange chicken and steak kabob appetizer.  Service was friendly while I was there and the food was tasty and cooked well.  I usually go to Yume (newer restaurant in the strip mall of Schaumburg &amp; Plumb Grove) for sushi.  Always had good sushi there, but, I think I will have to give this place another try sometime soon and try their sushi.  Glad I found this place and I will update as I eat here more.  Give them a try!"

The special I got included two basic rolls for $10. At that price, I wasn&#39;t expecting anything special. However, I&#39;ve been to places with similar pricing and enjoyed my sushi a lot more. 

The sushi was falling apart and wasn&#39;t very flavorful. They looked like they had been rolled really quickly and there wasn&#39;t a consistent rice covering. The one roll I got (Mexican roll?) had a ton of cilantro and that&#39;s all I could taste. I also got a spicy salmon roll, which wasn&#39;t that flavorful. I do appreciate, however, that they use full pieces of salmon. The chopsticks they gave me were so flimsy they broke in half. 

Customer service was decent. Apparently they have two locations and I ordered food at the wrong one, which I realized right after placing my order. They called and transferred the order to the other location, which it seemed like they have to do often. 

Overall: not terrible for the price but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll return."

The service was terrible and my order wasn&#39;t the way I ordered it. For the longest time my wife and I were trying to flag down our waitress&#39;s. We pretty much finished our meal and still no waitress. Later, I finally got up and asked the sushi maker to please hand us to-go containers and that&#39;s when our waitress finally showed up. As she SET our bill on the table, she asked us how our meal was. ARE YOU KIDDING! I mentioned to her the problem and she said &#34;oh, we can fix that&#34;. I said to her, &#34;No thanks. It&#39;s too late, we&#39;re leaving now&#34;. My dinner was bland and my wife&#39;s beef glaze was so sugary, you could make caramel out of it.

BTW, They say I couldn&#39;t  order a Miller beer but instead I needed to order a Miller Lite.
To me that&#39;s like being told I can&#39;t order a cola but instead I need to order a diet cola. Go Figure!

I tried the Golden Dragon, which wasn&#39;t bad but an interesting texture. I won&#39;t get it next I go to this place, but this is definitely a good places to grab sushi. The Toostie roll was amazing. It had more of a crunchy and then soft texture but full of flavor. 

The great this about this place is they don&#39;t just offer sushi, but some classic Chinese food. This is great for the people thst dont like sushi but would go to a restaurant of they have other options. I also ordered just a house salad but the dressing the use is great. 

My friend enjoyed the California rolls and the Red Dragon.

Was bare minimum portion , the only thing I could eat. The hot and sour soup had so much black pepper in it you could not even 
Eat or sip it! When the waitress asked if I wanted my food boxed I declined saying it was Not edible and she could care less. She went and got the bill and did not even have fortune cookies on the plate! Oh wait, they also stopped providing free tea. They said you can have signature tea for $3.50 a pot.

Won ton soup, crispy honey flank steak and saffron scallop with udon noodles are unique tastes. A little pricier than most places in the area but definitely worth the night out. Spent just over $100 on a family of four our last visit for about seven rolls with tea, apps and a couple drinks.

The inside is very nice and zen. When I came in they were playing very calming music. It  put me in a very tranquil mood. The tables contained little  rocks in them which was a nicely added decorative touch. There is a bar inside with excellent drinks. I ordered the mai thai which I never usually do at restaurants because of the fact that most drinks like that are usually  just full of sugar but I assure you this shit was delicious and strong. We also ordered sake bombs which isn&#39;t on the menu but I appreciate any restaurant which provides the accommodation. 


We ordered pot stickers and crab Rangoon as appetizers. I judge Chinese places on their crab Rangoon and let me tell ya the crab Rangoon was phenomneal. The potstickers were great as well and everything was so fresh.  We also had &#34;the Mexican&#34; sushi which tasted like cilantro. 

For our entrees, we ordered the house mixed noodles and kung pao chicken. Oh my god. This was so delicious that I know I cant even do the food justice. Both entrees were cooked to perfection. The veggies were crunchy yet well cooked. The meat was fresh as hell. 

I really enjoyed this place and would likely come back. Our waitress was pleasant and very accomodating. Definitely a place worth 5 stars!!"

This. This is exactly the reason whenever I&#39;m given the option to vote a business or event &#39;good for kids&#39;, I mark it with strong &#39;No&#39;. 

People with kids: Don&#39;t look at me like I&#39;m some kind of monster. Us childless people, we all do it. We&#39;re in it together. And just admit it, you probably did it too in your childless days.

People without kids: I&#39;m sorry I had to divulge our secret, but in my defense, I think they were on to us anyway. Why else would they still continue to show up at businesses that are, in fact, not good for kids, with their hoards of kids? To smite us, that&#39;s why.

On the other hand, it kind of has a bonus cyclical effect of serving as an unconventional birth control so less kids are made and that means less kids who kick your seat are out there, because I don&#39;t know about you, but I never leave a business where some kid has been kicking the back of my chair and screaming bloody murder and peaking over the booth at me thinking, &#39;gee, this gets me in the mood to go home and make a little monster of my own. A little demon just like all the other demons that I can tote around with me to all these nice restaurants and spend my money on good food for them to not eat it and then to make a big stink about it.&#39; 

**moving on, this relates to my experience because my partner and I bet the tab that the kids that we saw being brought to this nicer-ish restaurant would/would not misbehave. I bet against good behavior and won the bet, but lost my date-night mood. 

Beyond that, our server was exceptionally knowledgeable about both the food and sake menus. They have a bento box special that&#39;s actually a fantastic deal and you get to pick and choose quite a few things off the menu. 

We started with the vegetarian spring rolls, but they weren&#39;t what I was expecting. I was hoping for the the cold, wrapped rolls, not the deep-fried rolls, but for what they were, they were light and not greasy like at most places. I&#39;d ordered a hot green tea, and they told me right off the bat that it would take a while, but I wasn&#39;t expecting for a while to mean after my meal had already arrived, and also, for it to be Jasmine tea (which I can&#39;t stand because to me it tastes like baby Tylenol) when I&#39;d ordered the green tea when prompted for a type of tea, but it was fine as it was obvious our server was the only server on the floor and the other tables kind of had her running. 

The guy got a heaping portion of their vegetable udon and I went with Golden Dragon, Spicy Tuna and Vegetable Mexican Roll. The Golden Dragon looked really cool and had gold filigree on it (not really my thing, but okay) that wasn&#39;t my favorite - not bad by any means, just pale in comparison to the vegetable Mexican roll (one of the better veggie rolls I&#39;ve ever had) and the spicy tuna, which usually seems pretty basic, but Bistro Dragon serves up *maybe* the best I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ve been craving it for the past few weeks, and I&#39;m predicting that for at least one meal in the next few days I&#39;ll muster up the ability to not be super lazy and drive back for round two."

Let&#39;s be clear, this is not Lettuce Entertain You, so I understand some of the complaints.  

It&#39;s a conundrum.  How to provide authentic food with American service?  It&#39;s just hard to do or maybe impossible.

Where do I start...I like all the food I&#39;ve tried here:

Mongolian Beef - Delicious.
Sesame Crusted Tuna - Oh yeah, sushi grade.  Delicious.
Miso Salmon - Oh yeah, sushi grade.  Delicious.  
Egg rolls - Super solid
Hot and sour soup - I&#39;m a fan. 
Sushi is solid.  You can&#39;t argue with the price....reasonable.  I like the Mexican roll, spicy tuna and philly.
House Mixed Noodles - Good.

Red Dragon Roll, incredible crab rangoon (see previous review), flavorful crispy honey flank steak, mouth watering salt and pepper shrimp (be aware of the jalapeno seeds in the veggie mix!), and the previously outlined Mexican roll.

I ordered a pad thai without the vegetables and their sesame chicken. One girl could not understand my order of the pad thai without vegetables, do you still want sauce? She asked me. And I said yes, I do, just no vegetables. She was confused not because of a language barrier but because she must not have had an order with a change in it beforeand had to hand the phone off to someone else to take the order. In the end they told me 15 minutes for my order. When I went to pick up my order it turned out she was new and I think they said her name was Jessica. I understand asking for no vegetables is a strange request, but to ask if I still wanted sauce was a bit odd.

I showed up 25 minutes later to pick up my order and it was not yet ready. I paid and waited an additional 10 minutes for my order which was a bit awkward as I sat on a chair in front of the chair as people came to eat at the sitdown restaurant.

At the end of the day, had the food been great, all would be forgiven. Sadly, the food was not good, my order was still wrong (had some vegetables in the pad thai but was missing others) and the prices are expensive here. The sesame chicken was good but nothing great that I would get again. The pad thai was not only an incorrect order, but it was quite bland and flavorless. I ate a fourth of it and ended up throwing the rest out.

I&#39;ve heard they have good lunch specials and sushi here so I&#39;m willing to give it another try, but so far not a great experience at Bistro Dragon."

I called Bistro Dragon because it was close (about ~5 miles away) and reasonably priced.  The man who answered the phone was SO incredibly rude I decided not to food on principle!  He took down my information for delivery, and then told me my hotel was &#34;too far.&#34;  I gave him my address, and after mumbling on the phone/doing a Googlemap search, he concluded that my hotel wasn&#39;t that far and he could do the delivery.

He then begrudgingly took my order - and proceeded to tell me that I had to order more food for delivery!  I wish he had told me that right off the bat instead of wasting my time.  It clearly seemed like this person did not enjoy his job."

We have been going here for years and it seems to be new owners or a completely new staff because we have had about five negative experiences within the last 6 months. The two people who usually take the phone orders and take the money are a young awkward guy and miserable short woman who NEVER smiles, these two lack customer service completely! Today is valentines day, we had food ordered and the younger guy on the phone , who has ZERO cust. Service skills  said 25 mins. The order wasn&#39;t ready until 50mins later and everybody waiting for their pick up orders was complaining in there and saying &#34;it&#39;s been over an hour, you told us 30 mins!&#34;Ours was only sashimi which is probably why it wasn&#39;t over an hour, just 50 minutes -_-.
The sushi is great. I&#39;ve never gotten sick from it in all the years I&#39;ve eaten here, but the service is beyond terrible!! I have called to place phone orders and delivery orders recently and they never answer the phone even after multiple attempts,so I&#39;ve gone elsewhere. Try SAKE in Schaumburg.

The place is tucked in a strip mall on the corner of Beisterfield and Meachum. The place is somewhat small, with booths outlining the window area and regular tables in the middle. The menu is a mix of sushi and Chinese food -- from the typical Dragon Rolls to your Sesame Chicken.

 We ordered several rolls -- the Mexican, Tiger, Ping-Pong, Green Dragon, Haru, and Spider Rolls. All were pretty fantastic! The Tiger Roll came in like 8 pieces, while everything else was 4-6 pieces. 

Unfortunately, even after ordering all those rolls, we were still hungry. Perhaps, its because I&#39;m a pig (I try to average from 2500 - 3000 calories a day due to weight training) or I was just extremely hungry that day, but I just felt the food was just not the typical &#34;asian&#34; food. As we all know, asian food is known for the quantities and portions. Anywho, we decided to order the Seafood Chow Mein afterwards. The plate again, wasn&#39;t that big, but the noodles were awesome. It had the imitation crab, peapods, shrimp, squid, and scallops. The squid and scallops tasted like they were heated from frozen, but overall, not bad dish. Overall, tasty food, but yeah, I wish the portions were bigger

BATHROOM REVIEW: The bathroom was tucked near the back of the place. It had two private bathrooms. Inside, the bathroom was super-clean and smelled pretty good. It had the potpourri dish on the sink that could probably mask the worst animal poops a man can dish out. Everything was in order and super clean. Sit or squat? Sit!!"

Some of the reviews have been mixed, but when I realized that each of the ones that were not great were take-out, and every review I saw for dine in was good, I decided to give it a try.

A colleague went with me.  This is a storefront restaurant in a small strip mall, almost unnoticeable.  When you enter, though, it is very chic and well designed.  They have a wonderful bar/sushi bar and lots of teak.

I would classify the menu as Asian Fusion - mixtures of Chinese, Japanese and Thai.  They have a wonderful lunch menu - one side is a you-make-it Bento Box selection.  It includes salad, soup (probably the best sweet and sour soup I&#39;ve ever had), choice of rice or sushi, choice of entrees and either a spring roll or egg roll.

We both chose Bento Boxes.  Interestingly, they have burger options in the Bento boxes.  In addition to beef, they have two fish options - soy salmon and spicy tuna.  I had the salmon and my colleague had the tuna.  There are two sliders in an order, so we traded one each.  At $7.75, it was reasonable and a lot of food.

Everything was great, including the service.  It was not very crowded, so we had a lot of attention, which was nice.  My only minor complaint goes to something insignificant.  I thought hot tea came at no cost in Chinese restaurants, but not here. They did have a nice selection of several teas (we had Jasmine), but the pot was $2.95.

Not that I know they charge for tea, I won&#39;t be surprised next time.  I think this could become a regular lunch stop."

My sister has been raving and raving about this place near her office we HAVE to go to. So we went last week. It was friggin&#39; awesome! Great service by, my new favorite server, Ming. We totally over ordered on our first visit, but it was worth it. We were able to try a little more food than we normally would have. Their food was FRESH and delicious. 

We began our adventure with the egg rolls and the crab rangoon my sister insisted we try. I was glad I&#39;m a pushover cause they were both wonderful. Their food is not greasy at all. In fact, because everything is so fresh, it&#39;s hard to tell it was deep fried at all. Their dipping sauces were even tasty!

I have never ordered Hot &amp; Sour Soup anywhere, so I can&#39;t compare, but I can tell you this---their hot &amp; sour soup is incredible! It is like egg drop soup with chicken, tofu, carrots and has a little kick. I can tell you the next time I&#39;m sick with a head cold, I&#39;ll be sending my boyfriend here to get me soup.

Ming recommended their Crispy Honey Flank Steak. It had a nice flavor but was a little chewy to me. We also ordered some General Tao&#39;s Chicken and Chicken Chow Mein. After we placed our order, Ming arrived back at our table just to confirm we wanted Chow Mein, and we insisted this was what we wanted. We were wrong. It was the Lo Mein we meant to order (the thick noodles). Our fault....we should have listened to him. :( Not to worry, we remembered last night on our second trip in the last week. 

Ming was there again to serve us. He is so nice. What a treat! We brought my boyfriend this time and got pot stickers in addition to our appetizer spread! Wow. That&#39;s all i can say. I really think we can just go for apps and soup next week. By the time the food comes, I&#39;m full from the soup and apps. I had the soup again and of course, it rocked. We tried the Lemon Sesame Chicken this time and it was very good. The quality chicken they use is moist and the breading is not over-bearing at all. I just really love the ingredients they use here.

I recommend them to anyone who wants to try something new and believe me, you will become a regular quickly, too!"

One time, a buddy &amp; I went there &amp; messed up on the ordering &amp; ended up with a pound or two of sushi each. We sat for 3 hrs eating it all. The wait staff &amp; chefs watched us &amp; I&#39;m pretty sure I saw bets taking place. Money definitely changed hands between chefs."

I had grilled steak with half a sushi roll. The steak was amazing, and the sauteed veggies were good. The sushi roll was the perfect companion for it.

Driving down Meacham on a road that has numerous small strip malls with local restaurants, when I saw the &#34;Sushi Chinese&#34; sign from the road, I pulled in. 

At a casual glance from the outside, this place looks like another hole in the wall. But upon entry, I discovered a nicely kept, small restaurant serving a variety of Asian cuisine. I opted for my usual Asian standby at this place, a tekka maki appetizer with a chicken pad thai dinner. Neither disappointed - the sushi was good and the pad thai dinner was generous and came out medium spicy as I had ordered. Ended up taking almost 1/2 of it home as it was quite a bit to eat.

I don&#39;t get over to that area too often, but if/when I do and if I&#39;m hungry, Bistro Dragon will be on the list for another visit!"

I&#39;ve driven past it countless times since it has opened and always thought to myself &#34;Oh look, another crappy Chinese restaurant probably serving up cat in place of chicken.&#34; Oh, how wrong I was. 

In fact, I was wronger than wrong. First of all, this isn&#39;t your run of the mill Chinese restaurant. Yes, they serve Chinese dishes. Some traditional, some not so traditional. But they also serve sushi, stir-fried noodles, skewers, and a handful of curry dishes. The menu encompasses a wide variety of Asian flavors, not just Chinese.

I came in for lunch and decided to get the Bento Box for a whopping $7.75. I opted for the AAC ((Avocado//Asparagus//Cucumber)) Roll which came with a salad, a veggie spring roll, miso soup, and fried rice. Whoa. I left stuffed. The salad was awesome. It was made with fresh spring greens ((props for not using crap-tastic ice berg lettuce!!)), a few pieces of sliced red pepper, and had a tart ginger dressing on top. The miso soup was delicious...but could have used a few more pieces of tofu. ((Then again, I&#39;m a tofu whore)). The fried rice was packed full of veggies and scrambled egg. It wasn&#39;t heavy on the sauce, so I indulged with a little more soy sauce. The AAC roll was perfectly roll and just the right size. This was definitely a bento box done right!

Service was speedy and spectacular. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. Within about 6 minutes of placing my order, my food was out of the kitchen and in my mouth. 

The decor could use a little uplifting. However, I love the booths with the shadow box in the middle of the table with the little pieces of sushi ((fake of course)) and rocks inside. It&#39;s a nice touch. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back to Bistro Dragon in the very near future. And although I&#39;m kicking my own ass for not coming in sooner, it&#39;s better late than never!."

We&#39;ve ordered take out and dined in maybe ten times in the last year.  We primarily order Chinese when we visit but have tried the sushi and it was alright.  There are definitely better places for sushi in this area.

What you can count on: fresh and super tasty Chinese for what I think are pretty reasonable prices.  We love the Chicken with Broccoli and classic pick General Tsao Chicken.  We&#39;ve tried the Honey Flank Steak and the sauce was especially memorable, yum!  I also sampled the ramen one night, I probably won&#39;t order that one again.  They do have a pretty wide variety which is nice.

The service is always so disappointing though.  We don&#39;t even bother dining in anymore.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty nice, even a little bit surprising given the tired look of the strip mall that it is located in.  However, the servers for the most part are a bit grouchy and even checking out at the counter is a little awkward.  If you call in a take out order don&#39;t expect much friendliness.  I tolerate the poor service because generally the food is pretty good and they are 5 minutes from my house.  I do like that they participate in the Belly program.

Overall, I would recommend this place for take out if you live in the area but don&#39;t make a special trip to dine in."

Dinner on Saturday night with my brother-in-law who&#39;s visiting from Houston.  We&#39;d just spent the entire day at the pool for my daughter&#39;s bday party so we were too tired to go anywhere further than a few miles, but weren&#39;t willing to settle for fast-food...and our first choice was Chinese or Sushi, so off we went to Bistro Dragon.  

It was 7ish and the restaurant was quiet although they had a half-full dining room.  we hesitated dining in since we had the kids with us, but since my 4-year-old son was sleeping, and they were able to fit the stroller in at the table, we went ahead.  I have to heed the advice of our girl, Candice, though...I would not bring my kids here unless I knew for sure they&#39;d behave themselves.  The dining room is small and sound carries throughout (we were at a table, but I definitely wouldn&#39;t chance a booth if the kids were being even the slightest bit rowdy).  Not to mention, we were enjoying the soft reggae music (Bob Marley) playing in the background and it would have killed the atmosphere to have my kids being the &#39;loud&#39; ones.  There were other families coming in as we were leaving, one with kids as young as mine, and they too seemed to be behaving.

For the table, we ordered the shrimp fried rice (still fantastic and still with generous sized and generous portions of shrimp), orange chicken not spicy (my daughter&#39;s fave - she liked the strong tangy flavor, cooked with orange zest and including the orange rind), and teriyaki shrimp (it went fast, tender shrimp, good sweet/salty flavor to the teriyaki).  My daughter, hubby and BIL shared a mermaid roll and they loved it.  And my hubby and BIL had oyster shooters that were on special (w/quail egg and salmon roe)...not exactly my cup of tea but they were raving about it.  Wine was on special too, $5 a glass, which IS my cup of tea, so I had to have a couple of glasses, while the guys shared Sapporos.

Love the ambiance and set-up here.  Nice, intimate, and unpretentious.  This is a definite new go-to spot and not just for carryout (and likely for date night)."

They are located in a strip mall, which will probably give the impression that the place isn&#39;t very good.  Perhaps it&#39;s time the owners upgraded their facilities so the tenants can drum up more business.  That being said; the interior will surprise you.

It&#39;s a very modern and comfortable space with back-lite wood panels on the wall, a cute and functional bar and plenty of seating.  the tables are &#39;custom&#39; with small decorative glass tops and cute sand gardens inside.

The food was great.  I haven&#39;t been for dinner, but I hear it&#39;s a popular hang out.  I have however enjoyed their lunch special  It arrives on a tray much like the ones you used in school, and for 8$ you leave feeling plenty full.  They give you a few options to choose from and you can choose one of each.  Sushi, cooked, and an appetizer.  I had orange chicken, two pcs of sushi, an egg roll and rice.

I was recommended to come here about 2 years ago and finally my husband and I decided to order sushi from here a few weeks ago and OH MY GOD! It was delicious!! You can taste the freshness of all the ingredients including the fish. We scarfed down 7 different rolls together. My favorite was the Volcano (spicy but not too spicy). Their Mermaid roll is pretty spectacular too as well as the Tootsie roll. Next time I think we will try their Chinese food menu as well.

While looking at it from the outside it might not be the most eye-catching being located in the middle of a run-down strip mall. However, the food at this restaurant has to be the best Chinese (and other Asian) food in the area. You can tell each meal is prepared with fresh, quality ingredients. Unlike most Chinese restaurants that make you feel queasy from grease, Bistro Dragon leaves us feeling full without the stomach ache. The sushi itself is good and can be made with soy paper if you don&#39;t like the seaweed like us (we aren&#39;t sushi fanatics so we can&#39;t speak on the sushi authenticity or comparative quality but it&#39;s great for us).

For all reading this review: this restaurant is definitely a go-to restaurant if you are in the mood for Chinese food and have never been here before. You will not be disappointed."

It&#39;s right down the street from my house and we are frequent visitors here.  It has a variety of traditional and non-traditional sushi rolls, so even people who don&#39;t normally like sushi are prone to find something they like.  Their non-sushi entrees are also quite good.  I am a Mongolian Beef fan and Bistro Dragon has some of the best I&#39;ve tried - it&#39;s not spicy like this dish sometimes is (and I do like spicy), but it is sweet and tender with plenty of meat and green onions.  The crab rangoons are amazing, so make sure to try those.  I also recommend the tempura fried banana and ice cream for dessert - but split it at least two ways!

Overall, Bistro Dragon is a great value for the money (especially their lunch box).  Certainly other restaurants might have more brag-worthy sushi, but for what you pay it makes this restaurant easy to praise.  Also there are a variety of unique tapas style dishes that are worth sampling (i.e. beef tataki, salt and pepper smelts, and ginger grilled squid), so there&#39;s plenty of reason for return trips."

Boy, was it good! This was my first dinner experience here and I chose to indulge with my sister. We ordered more than we should have, but it was okay because we had hungry gentleman at home (watching the Hawks game) awaiting our arrival with leftovers. 

We started with the famous crab rangoon and the egg rolls. Yummy in my tummy! Honestly, I think the appetizers are my favorite part of the meal. Not too greasy. Beautifully crisp and seasoned just right. I would like to work my way through the rest of the appetizers, but can&#39;t seem to get much further because I like these two so much. 

We moved on to soup. My sister had the hot &amp; sour which I am pretty sure she loved. I tried it even though I am not a fan of egg in the least bit - regardless, the flavor was delicious! The kick was delightful. I ordered the Chinese Chicken Soup which I found to be a unique combination of white meat chicken, cilantro, vermicelli noodles and lime. My only wish is that it was served piping hot which it was not. I will just make sure to ask them to do that next time. 

I should point out that for $15.95 each we could have ordered a box with soup, an appetizer and some sushi or another chinese dish, I thought about this and under normal circumstance that would have been the way to go. Since we were purposely over-ordering, we ordered three separate dishes instead. A honey glazed steak, general tao&#39;s chicken and chicken chow mein. We were looking forward to the steak the most and it was our least favorite dish. There was nothing wrong with it other than it was not what we envisioned. The steak was cut into strips, breaded and sauteed with sauce and veggies. Again, it was fine, but not what we expected. The general tao&#39;s chicken was spicy, lightly breaded perfectly and had just the right amount of sauce. I think three or four different types of peppers are used in that dish, so every step of the way, I felt a different type of heat. A bit of spice right away, a different more intense heat as I ate a little more and then a nice after &#34;burn&#34;. I don&#39;t really know any other way to describe it, but it was quite good. Finally, my favorite of the main dishes was the chicken chow mein. We should have ordered lo mein to get a soft noodle, but the pan fried chow mein was a nice change of pace. The large pieces of unbreaded chicken were plentiful. The veggies were cooked perfectly (although there were mushrooms included that I didn&#39;t notice on the menu) and the sauce was the &#34;icing on the cake&#34;! 

Service was great! Our server was knowledgeable and kept answering all of our questions without hesitation. He was not obtrusive and seemed to know exactly when to drop by the table. I&#39;ve said it once and I will say it again...I will be back soon. 

p.s. Delivery is now available!!! :-)"

The staff is always nice and the food is very tasty. Between dining in and getting take-out I think I&#39;ve tried almost every item on the menu and it&#39;s always been very good. The sushi is always fresh and definitely one of the best in the area.

I noticed a couple other reviewers mention that the staff is unfriendly and I must say that that has not happened to me. Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been going to this place for a few years and they know me but I&#39;ve always felt welcomed and it&#39;s definitely one of the reasons I really enjoy eating here (the other being the food..)"

For starters, also offering sushi is a huge plus. And they don&#39;t only offer it, they&#39;re good at making it. I highly recommend the Tiger Roll.
The big differentiation is with the Chinese dishes. General Tso&#39;s is my go to order at at Chinese restaurants, and I didn&#39;t stray from the norm here. And it was absolutely the best General Tso&#39;s that I&#39;ve ever had. 
Bistro Dragon uses chunks of whole chicken, quality chicken. It&#39;s not breaded, it&#39;s not full of gristle or mystery. It&#39;s quite obviously just chunks of white meat in the sauce (which is great because they include the spicy peppers and it&#39;s not very gelatinous).
To top it off, delivery was fast and pleasant.
If you&#39;re looking for great Asian food and you&#39;re in the area, make it Bistro Dragon."

Right of the bat, the price for the bento box and the rolls was not bad at all. The soup was great. I tasted the spicey and sour ( awesome ) and the miso soup was great. Im a little troubled with the rolls though. I think they need to be tighter to make it taste better. I always feel that when there loose, then the inside is almost coming apart and its not enjoyable. I would come back here for lunch, id love to see how their dinner is.

Food: Was ok not too bad.
Taste: The soup and spring roll was the most tasteful thing
Highlights: The inside decor was nice
Comments: Good place to go to for a decent lunch"

It&#39;s pretty unusual to find something so interesting and fushion-y in a small suburban restaurant, and I love it.  A bold Chinese and Japanese mix that has a few really unique items. &#34;Asian burger flight,&#34; for example.

It&#39;s the only good place I know of for the times when I feel like sushi AND Chinese food (this happens often :D).  Good choices for a vegetarian, too.

My favorite thing on the menu is the spinach pot stickers. Insanely tasty.

Also great: AAC rmaki rolls, tofu 3-ways, and the noodle dishes, which are mildly salted (many Chinese restaurants -- Yu&#39;s Mandarin, for example -- tend to over-salt their noodle dishes, so I really appreciate this).  They have their menu online, so take a look!

Service is good, and the decor is surprisingly modern and pretty with funky lighting.  If you&#39;re in the NW burbs and want to try something different, this is the place!"

The decor inside is trendy and clean. It was a pleasant surprise! They offer sushi and pan Asian. Service was great, the waitress was really nice and they had a good deal on wine that night around $5 a glass.  I got sushi and hubby got teriyaki chicken and shared seaweed salad.  My sushi was good, seaweed salad was decent however his teriyaki chicken was interesting.  It looked like sliced chicen breast with teriyaki sauce drizzled on top.  Could&#39;ve done that myself......however they gave a generous portion of green veggies and my husband is not a huge fan of Asian cuisine so he was a happy camper.  It wasn&#39;t packed but most of the tables were taken.  I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to going back if we were in that area......"

The shopping center is a little below average, but soon as you walk in you know this place is a well run restaurant.  And the food is fantastic.  Kevin the owner is creative and consistent.  I love the binto (sp.?) boxes for lunch and sushi for dinner. 

 I have had sushi in many restaurants, but none better than here.  It can also be fun because they have specialty rolls on the board that change regularly.  Try the oysters and the hot and sour soup, two of my favorites.

Another great service available is their catering.  I have attended several events catered by Bistro Dragon and everything was great.  If you need a business lunch or an elegant dinner for you and your guests, I highly recommend them.

Lastly, please know this is not a very expensive place.  Lunch is very reasonable for sit down restaurant.  Dinner could run you more, but still affordable and great value.  Unlike some local franchise restaurants, you WILL feel like you got great value and it is well worth the money."

I then had the spicy tuna, shredded again &amp; really heavy on the wasabi.  The miso soup was great &amp; I had edamame.

The bento box was really cute. It came with an egg roll, the main dish, rice as well as a salad. The portions were great, just enough to fill you up without leftovers.

I wanted sushi, my partner in crime wanted Chinese food.  We were both starving and in desperate need to food and libations.  Mr. iPhone pointed us in the direction of Bistro Dragon which was nearby and would potentially fill our sushi and Chinese fix.  

The place is in the middle of a semi-run down looking strip mall.  There were tacky, illuminated pictures of some of the food in the windows, like many typical, mediocre chinese take out places would have.  I was skeptical.  From the looks of it I was expecting Panda Express quality food.  But don&#39;t judge a book by its cover, right? Inside was a completely different scene.  The place was definitely pushing for a trendy sushi-looking vibe, and it worked. It was cute, and very clean. THANKFULLY.

The food was delicious.  The sashimi platter was nicely filled with fresh, high quality cuts of fishies.  And it&#39;s reasonably priced compared to many other places.  The rolls were good too.  The standard rolls such as spicy tuna and spicy scallops were of the same caliber of most sushi places, but the signature rolls were surprisingly impressive.

I don&#39;t eat seafood, but I love veggie sushi. The restaurant placed coupons in our apartment complex so we decided to check it out after I looked at their menu online. The menu showed that they had an interesting variety of veggie sushi. I was really looking forward to trying some of the different rolls. 

However, when we looked over the menu after being seated none of those rolls were on the menu! I was so dissappointed. 

Service was pretty bad, at best. We were there pretty early for NYE standards. There were about 5 tables and 1 waitress. Soon the place was PACKED! After that the service went from bad to worse. I noticed that one lady told the waitress that she was a vegetarian and wanted to know where the veggie rolls were that had been posted on their online menu. At least I wasn&#39;t the only one that was disappointed by this. 

The food wasn&#39;t bad. We had the prix fix menu and the food was decent.

The chef/owner is usually behind the sushi bar and tries to make everyone sits down there feel at home. The first couple times I came in and he noticed I was sitting by myself and gave me a sample appetizer to strike up conversation which you rarely see in a restaurant. 

That being said, I love the food as well. I grew up eating good Chinese food and I&#39;ve never been disappointed. I&#39;ve also never been one to like sushi but they have me trying new things and pushing my personal boundaries. It&#39;s hard for me to comment on one item in particular because I&#39;ve eaten pretty much the entire menu. If I had to recommend one item though, it would be there crispy spicy tuna. It&#39;s a spicy tuna tartar that sits upon a fried rice ball with a little sliver of jalapeño on top. That bite is the one thing that keeps my girlfriend from going vegetarian. You get the sensation of two different temperatures with the cold tartar and the hot rice ball, as well as differing textures from the two. You also get different spice levels within the tartar itself. In my opinion, it&#39;s the perfect bite. Give this place a shot. I recommend sitting at the bar, especially if you plan on ordering sushi. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

The restaurant is very dimly lit when you enter and the host stand is quite a ways back, with very little to no customers in the place, so right away you get this kind of...haunted house type of feeling where you are entering and not knowing what to expect. 

There were about 8 customers on their teppenyaki side but none on the sushi side where we were sat. They had a Yelp deal and when we went in and we wanted to alert them we bought it right away. They had no idea what it was and said, it&#39;s for THIS restaurant? After awkwardly looking at it for a couple minutes, she said oh, Yue-Sun hmm Ok. And we proceeded on! They gave us only the option for AYCE but I just don&#39;t eat much in a sitting. We had to ask for actual menus outside of the AYCE so we could order from that instead. We ended up ordering a few things when we could. Considering we were the only sushi table, it was a surprising we weren&#39;t checked in on and were often waiting for service.

When you are ordering rolls, it&#39;s hard. Especially if you have food allergies. They do not list ingredients for about half the rolls so a big suggestion to the restaurant would be to please list the ingredients in your maki. Also, if you do list the ingredients, stick to them...rolls we ordered came differently than described on the menu and it was as if whatever they had in back was thrown into them. 

Crab Rangoon - Actually good in flavor. It was mostly cream cheese, with not a lot of imitation crab meat but hey! It tasted good and I gobbled it all up. It was 3 pieces for $6.50 though which may be a buck or two two much for what it is.

Their Philly Roll - it ain&#39;t a philly roll. It had lettuce in it...which was interesting. And the salmon is supposed to be smoked in a philly roll &amp; they even listed it as such, however it came out fully cooked through. And...I don&#39;t know that it was salmon...it was a cooked white-colored fish. Sooo....that was weird and interesting. It wasn&#39;t bad, I must say...just not what was advertised and I don&#39;t know what it was I was putting in my mouth.

My dude got other rolls that had ingredients in them not listed and due to my shellfish allergy, I couldn&#39;t risk trying them. He did enjoy them though.

Rolls weren&#39;t done well. Hastily put together, not tightly packed. The whole sushi experience was weird though because they have a conveyor belt and it wasn&#39;t running. It makes total sense because there were no other sushi customers the whole time we were in there. However it was sad because that would have made for a fun experience! Also, they had a sushi station where the sushi chef should stand and prep everything but it looked like it had been abondoned for quite some time with boxes sitting back there. 

I feel bad because my man picked this place for dinner before a Yelp event. Well...he tried! Valiant effort. Sadly, not recommended."

When they brought the bill out, it was $80 minus $30 off the bill, total $50. Remember, you pay $13 to get $30 off which makes no sense. Total payment was $63. The add is very misleading.

I went here about two months ago with a group of 4. It was not a super busy night but they did have about 1/3 of the restaurant full. 

The service was not very attentive at all. I had to go back several times to get the order sheet from the hostess. The servers never came around to ask if I wanted another beer or water. They also forget many of the sushi we ordered. We probably got 1/2 of the rolls we marked on the sheet. 

The food was not prepared well at all! The fish was frozen over and the rice was rock solid. Also the cooked food was soggy. You could tell it was not cooked all the way. To be blunt, the food disgusted my group.

Yue-Sun shares space in the Georgetown Square Maill in Wood Dale, IL with the likes of Big Lots, Dollar General, Super Low Foods, a resale shop and a coin operated cleaners among other things.  This should have raised a flag.  

When we entered, there were signs saying the Friday and Saturday night all you can eat sushi was no longer available.  We entered a fairly darkly lit restaurant - on the right was the sushi bar and on the left were about 10 teppan tables.  The first table had two chefs and the rest of the tables were open.  We were seated and told we could go and order as many times as we wanted.  She took our drink order before we got up.

One half of the table was set up for shrimp dishes and rice, the other half of the table did the steak, chicken and vegetables.  The cooks were very nice and polite.  The service was actually pretty good - when we finished a plate it was taken immediately, and before we could empty our glasses, they were refilled for us.

There is a &#34;salad bar&#34; on the edge of the teppan table.  It consists of a bowl of lettuce and a couple of dressings.  That is all.

The food was okay, not great.  We can start with the shrimp - they were only a little larger than salad sized.  First, I ordered the shrimp with soy sauce.  They do cook it to order on the teppan table.  They tasted fine, although when looking at them closely, they don&#39;t appear to have been cleaned very well.

While cooking the shrimp, the chef asked if I wanted fried rice. I expected him to cook it fresh, but he pulled a large bowl out with fried rice pre-cooked and filled a small bowl.

Then, it was onto the meat.  First I tried the Hibachi Chicken.  It was flavorful.  The vegetables included white or yellow onions, button mushrooms, a few sprouts and carrots.  They overwhelmingly fill the plate with these leaving little room for the meat. Well, probably better for you that way.  I tried the steak, this time saying to serve only about 1/2 of the veggies. It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t like them, but I was getting pretty full by then.  The steak was tender and good.

So, why two stars?  I only gave Yue-Sun two stars partially because of the location, but mainly due to comparisons with other teppan table restaurants.  When you are used to the service and flourishes of Benihana, you come to expect something more of a show.In fairness, Yue-Sun is also less than half the price of Benihana but you get what you pay for.

So, if you want a lot of food, and like hibachi grills, this may be the place for you.  When you do go, know ahead of time that drinks are not included and a coke is $3.  Before you&#39;re done, with tip, lunch turns out to be about $19.  

My suggestion - there are plenty of all you can eat Chinese restaurants out there that serve lunch for about 1/2 of the price. They offer a variety of selections, including some American favorites. Most of them offer decent sushi, and some have Mongolian Barbecues. Go to one of them, they are cheaper and have a wider variety."

The food was OVER PRICED! For a place like Yue-Sun, which is located in a strip mall in Wood Dale? It&#39;s next to a public laundry center for crying out loud. We bought a $15 for $30 Groupon to try the place out and we still ended up paying $70. We went on a Thursday night. NOBODY except for my husband and I were in the entire restaurant. The owner had nothing to do and kept staring at us from a distance, where she was sitting. Awkward! 

My husband ordered the hibachi steak and I ordered the chicken teriyaki. I hated my chicken. It was over cooked and tasteless. I loved the soup and salad though, I won&#39;t lie.

The chef did some awesome tricks and kept us entertained. I guess his tricks were worth the $70 that we spent. Again, this is AFTER the Groupon discount, for TWO PEOPLE, at a place that&#39;s near a laundry mat!!!!!!!!

I am not coming back to this place again. It&#39;s like a ghost town in there even on a Thursday night. Oh, did I mention it was Halloween Day. So, literally it was a ghost town in there!"

The sushi service plate side use to be a train track set up but I guess they changed it due to the train itself getting derailed at times, watch out flying fish!
The conveyor belt system seems to be ok.  The sushi and hibachi choices are the same and still good.  Some of the choices are a bit fancier like 2 pcs of mini spider roll.  
I do miss seeing the 2 pcs of bacon wrapped scallops as a choice.  You now have to order it as an appetizers for 6 pcs for almost 12 bucks!  Man, we almost fell over when we saw the bill for two of us eating at the sushi side, it&#39;s because we order other sides dishes (phatties, LOL!) like the bacon wrapped scallops, combo fried rice, and a recommend ninja maki roll (not a fan of dikon radish in my maki roll).
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I try to support my local joynts however, I would only go to this place when we&#39;re lazy to take a trip up to Tsukasa in Vernon Hills for hibachi steak n lobster.  And for sushi belt with Hibachi plates, I would hike to Kampi or just sushi good ole Sushi Station.

Pros:
Location is close to my casa and J.O.B. (for a quick lunch)
Friendly people, say hi to Cindy or Shirley at the front known them for years...
They have specials for habachi/sushi
They have coupons in the mailer and free hibachi dinner on your birthday 
Place is roomy even a private room in the back
Attentive in refilling my drink without me asking, that&#39;s a plus!

Cons:
The lack of quality and taste (seasoning) of food, depending who is cooking the food in the back or making the sushi.
Got expensive for the amount/quality of the food.

Overall..I would still go back (loyalty I guess) only as a back up of a back up for Japanese food.  I do hope they get their act together and bring back the quality of the food!"

Other tables were getting cooks before we were and it just didn&#39;t seem fair. I decided that night to skip the greasy food and order a california sushi roll. It was the worst maki roll I had ever eaten. I had to scrap what I thought was canned tuna off the rolls, just so I could eat the avocado. It didn&#39;t taste fresh at all!

sushi: they gave lots of fish n their rolls. however, i didn&#39;t find their rolls tasty or unique. I don&#39;t think their fish is super fresh either. (we didn&#39;t get sick from it). we were just not impressed with it overall. 

we went back the second time to try hibachi. i was shocked by the hibachi&#39;s price. The cheapest hibachi entree is at about $26 for chicken! (the restaurant is located in a shabby looking strip mall in wood dale!) I had a groupon that is about to expire. That&#39;s why we did it.

There was a large amount of scallop in the maki, but it was just not very good. The spider roll tasted funny and the soft shell crab was mostly tempura breading.

To see this place take a dive the way it has.  Food quality is bland   The nighttime witch as I call her.  Is cold. No personality.   The staff doesn&#39;t listen when you ask for something my drink sits empty for awhile before they fill it or ask how dinner is.   The one busboy barely keeps up.   The shorter lady which I believe is manager or owner. Is only one I have ever seen with personality but over the years. She looks tired of being here.       Deft need to work on quality of food.  And bring in some fresh personality. I want to enjoy my dinner and laugh with people around me.  Not have to sit and feel awkward  waiting for a server to come around I ask for somthing I get yes. Then they never come back around.    They have some work todo

I thought it was great until I opened my eyes to the world around me. There are plenty of other sushi places that use way higher quality ingredients and *ahem* real crab not imitation. I know I&#39;m only paying 21 dollars, but I deserve some tlc. Other places such as hokkai are way better and worth the extra 30 minute drive to go. All in all, it has good rolls. Just needs better quality control, and real foods. Two of my friends got food poisioning from there sushi and we won&#39;t go back after being customers for years. Their caterpillar roll and baby spider roll were my favorites since they actually had real ingredients. Have fun being completely ignored once the place becomes minorly busy. Drink refills are almost never and waitresses walk right past you. For sushi group of 3 and a total of about 10 rolls between us three we waited on average 2.5 hours. Never going to head back unless things visiably change or someone else pays for me. The food is about a 3.0 star out of 5. Service is literally 0. I seriously wanted to grab my own drinks and do everything myself. They actually got upset when I didn&#39;t tip after the service."

Not crowded at all and we were seated immediately at a table by ourselves. Soup was very good. Typical cold lettuce salad had a very flavorful dressing. Dipping sauces were top-notch. Filet was HUGE (I would guess it was 10 ozs.) and everything from fried rice to shrimp and steak was prepared well. Our chef was very talented and didn&#39;t miss a beat.

We have been here about 5-6 times in the past and the food was always decent with good service and reasonable prices. 

So, the hubs and I found ourselves in the area a few nights ago (with no sister at home so we couldn&#39;t stop there for dinner).  He suggested we check out Yue-Sun as he had a taste for sushi.  We walked in and the entrance looked really run down - not the entrance of a place I want to eat sushi.  Then we walked inside the actual restaurant and I was confident that I did not to eat raw fish from here.  I casually told the hubs we should leave but I think we both felt bad because the hostess had already spotted it.  We are totally horrible about leaving restaurants after we already walk in or sit down.  We have to get over that.  I flaked and pointed toward the teppanyaki station and we hesitantly sat down.

Dinner was actually decent.  My steak was cooked well and with good seasoning.  My husband had the chicken and liked it.  However, I couldn&#39;t help thinking that we were going to get sick from something.  I know, who thinks that.  It was just because the place looks very dirty and run down and I connected a dirty decor to poor sanitation and meat. 

The decor and cleanliness of the entire place has really gone downhill.  I am not sure what is going on but I think the place needs a bit of a makeover.  Nothing fancy - just a good deep cleaning and some new furniture/paint. 

My husband was a little shocked when the bill came as it was over $70.00 as we only had water and our meals.  We got in the car and he said &#34;never again.&#34;  He then agreed that I was right and we should have let the entrance be a sign .. small victory for me! 

I hope Yue-Sun can get their act together because the teppanyaki dining style was a good option in this area but not again for us."

They can&#39;t even give you one full shrimp.  The food such as rice and meat were ice cold.  It was dark, it was dreary and it smelled of resin grease.  My brand new coat is ruined with the stink of their greasy grease from their grills.  Which they should ventilate it correctly.  They call lettuce, cucumber and tomatoe a salad bar.  Seriously.  I would never eat here again.  The people whom worked here didn&#39;t look Japanese they looked all Hispanic.  The woman who seats you was a real witch.  No compassion what so ever.  Please you make think you are buying a good groupon or restaurant.com but you will have to spend 40.00 on a meal to use it.  My coat is ruined.  The place needs a toal gutting and remodel.

Its still your typical hibachi. They have 6 hibachi tables and this had a rotating sushi bar on the opposite side (which is now shutdown). Its a hit or miss whether they will be crowded or not.

First of all, you don&#39;t have to wait for any food/service with the Sushi &#34;Train&#34;, food is ready for you to pick up! Second of all, food is fairly priced--$2 a plate. Third of all, the food is right up there with some other fancy sushi joints I have been to. 

The atmosphere of the place isn&#39;t the best--but let&#39;s face it, you are there to eat your heart out and not look at the fancy decor. Especially if you are picking food from a conveyor belt :) 

The only downside is that, with the &#34;train&#34;, you don&#39;t know exactly what you are getting. Some of the selections are easy to point out--tempura veggies, California rolls, etc.  But the actual maki sushi is hard to identify--esp when you have a ton of them coming your way and they all look delicious!

As your enter you are always greeted by the same Japanese women that has been there for years. The restaurant is not as small as it seems from the outside and the atmosphere is typical for a Japanese steakhouse with tables seating 8 on one side and on the other side is a sushi bar. You need to be prepared to sit with other customers due to the tables not being separate. 
    The experience of a Japanese steak house is not like a typical dinning experience and if you have never experienced chefs cooking your meal in front of you it is a must see. 
  There isn&#39;t much you can say regarding the service since most of the meal is cooked and served in front of you other than the servers bringing you your salad and soup. I have noticed that after they have served your meal it does take some effort to get refills on your beverages. I was disappointed the last time I went due to the fact that it was a Friday night and they were trying to fill the table and we had to wait over 30 min for them to close the table and take our orders.  
    The meals are pricey but not any more than any other Japanese steak house you pay for the experience more than your meal. Portions are big and most of the time you will have left overs. You will have to pay a bit more for fired rice vs. white rice that comes it your meal but it is worth every penny! I could just eat the rice! I have never had anything at YUE SUN that I didn&#39;t enjoy. Look for coupons before you go it will at least cover the gratuity since it is already calculated into your bill. Yun Sun is definitely a place to go to for special occupations due to price but it is worth it."

Teppanyaki: Though we were at the Sushi counter, our friend ordered from the other menu. His food was generally the same as most average Japanese steakhouse food, he ordered the chicken.

The portions were ridiculously tiny. My wife had two thinly sliced smaller size shrimp and my fillet was supper tiny. We did get plenty of white rice, but not until we were ready to leave.

The sushi is below average. Food goes around a conveyor belt tossing random edible things at you. 
Sadly the sushi is just not of good quality,. The rice is generally way over cooked. Sometimes its under cooked. And ALL the time it is never seasoned properly.  You are supposed to use (seasoning the rice) rice vinegar, salt and sugar. I asked why the rice tasted simply like plain rice. The answer? &#34;We dont use salt and very little sugar&#34;. I told them what is supposed to be in the seasoning. Manager didnt care. Okie dokie. I didnt &#39;season&#39; my bill with a tip. Jerk.

It is expensive, but anyone who frequents hibachi grills won&#39;t really be surprised by the prices.

The fried rice is the best I&#39;ve ever had. Honestly, I have traveled far and wide to find a better or even comparable hibachi place (including all the big chains) and have always ended up wishing I went to Yue Sun instead.

I usually have the fried rice, and garlic shrimp and steak combo. Even the ginger dressing on their salads is amazing.

The concept of Yue-Sun is two sections split into the Sushi Train side and the Hibachi side.  The train is always fun but when we have a large group I enjoy being entertained by the hibachi chef.  The atmosphere is not upscale, kind of leading back to the mid &#39;90&#39;s, but the hospitality and the &#39;take your time&#39; attitudes bring me back time after time.  

While I tend to be a wine drinker when the wine selection is not that great I&#39;ll go for something else and here it is always the large Sopporo.   As soon as we sit down they always bring the warm towel to clean your hands and soon arrives the miso soup.  After the soup it&#39;s on to salad. . . a simple salad but it is the ginger dressing that I want to bring home in a bottle.

We always order some sushi, usually tuna, to have pre-dinner and have usually made it to our second Sopporo by then as well.  We always get the fried rice just because, no matter how many times I&#39;ve seen it, I still enjoy seeing the chef toss the egg around in the air.  I usually get the scallops with sesame seeds and the shrimp flambe&#39;, my husband the salmon with garlic sauce and filet.  I ALWAYS choose the green tea ice cream to finish.

All in all, Yue-Sun in Wood Dale, is always an enjoyable suburban dinner out.  If you have a big group be sure to call ahead (they even have a private dining area for the birthday groups, etc.).  After dinner walk across the parking lot to Shadow Bar for some great martinis."

Before leaving this place i went into their bathroom and in the next stall there was a person sick. This should of been the first clue.

Their Hibachi is better than Sushi, but the place smell so stinky, floor was so dirty and sticky!

The train side is NOT GOOD! They do have the same foods on the train for 20 minutes or more. When I asked to have golden shrimp added to the train, it was added instantly. What they do is, cook it ahead of time and then keep it warm for later. This makes the shrimp EXTREMELY overcooked and taste like rubber. All the shrimp I had was overcooked! I have also seen them take sushi off of a tray and add it to the train. They are pre-making that as well. I like my sushi to be fresh and made right before I eat it. It&#39;s really gross how long they let items revolve on the train. I think if it has gone around more than 8 times, it is time to take it off and put different food on.

Very affordable and you leave with a full belly...On top of that we were going to break in a rookie for his first taste of sushi.. What I got was an $18 tab for some Illinois Penitentiary grade sushi and for our friend, he had to make a stop at Wendy&#39;s for a burger and fries to wipe the foul tast of sushi out of his mouth....Dont get me wrong, the place would be packed if the prices were more affordable and if they threw in a lunch all you can eat...I just cant figure going to a shady strip mall sushi joint thas bilks a guy for $18.....Owners please take note and add the all you can eat lunch, then I might bring in the rest of my work gang to eat :)"

We also saw on Yue Sun&#39;s own website that they advertised an &#34;unlimited&#34; sushi bar/train.  We thought we were going to good deal, but we had not one, but two major problems with this restaurant.  

First, they refused to take the gift certificate claiming it was supposed to say &#34;Excludes Sushi Bar&#34; on it.  Well, the newer certificates have this printed on them but the one I bought was from a couple months ago and did NOT have this exclusion on it.  The expiration on that gift certificate was for one year from purchase, so it was still valid.  However, they refused to take it.  

The second major issue we had with this restaurant was that they advertise &#34;unlimited sushi from the train for $23.95&#34; on their website (http://www.yue-sun.com).  We thought this special was still valid because, hey, it&#39;s still on their website, right?  Well they ended up charging us $2.06 PER PLATE.  They said they have not had the unlimited sushi special for 2 years!  Well why is it still on their website then? 

STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT!"

Was I pleasantly surprised!  Yes, it was your traditional throw-the-spatula-up-in-the-air-and-catch-it-in-your-teeth-while-dancing teppenyaki steak house, but done better than most and the food was definitely better than the many others I&#39;ve been to.  There&#39;s one in Orlando that&#39;s killer, but I&#39;m not driving that far every time I feel like Japanese, so we won&#39;t go there.  I loved the pot stickers, the salad dressing was better than any other sesame ginger dressings I&#39;ve had (in fact, I bought a pint to take home and it didn&#39;t last very long), the steak was tender, everything was just wonderful.  And the show!  Well, let&#39;s just say that I&#39;ve spent big bucks to see professional entertainers that couldn&#39;t come close.  What a great evening!"

It is one of my kids favorite restaurants so that earns it points. I went here with no expectations and was rewarded with a great sashimi platter (one of the better I have had) and a well made standard teppenyaki meal. The grilled shrimp , fried rice , grilled sirloin and the glazed honey chicken were all killer. They also have an all you can eat sushi &#34;train&#34; for under $25 . A solid thumbs up for this place , especially for ages 6+ children, it&#39;s like a Japanese fireworks show and meal put together.
...
I tried the sushi train for the first time and I left full and content. This was really fun for trying things outside of my comfort zone. The Waitress also asked if I had any requests for the chef, nice touch. The spicy tuna roll is a mainstay for me , and it was really good. The Sashimi , almost any kind , I devour at a rapid rate , no different here , all was good. They also have single servings of their appetizers on the train, like a single crab rangoon or an egg roll. I can recommend the whole train experience. 
Note , there were signs all around that said they were ending the &#34;all you can eat&#34; portion of the train , and it would now be $1.85 per plate. To be honest , I was full after 12 plates , and I shoehorned in another 2 after that. I would probably hit the train up after the price switch , and still get full for close to the same amount."

I have been there about 10 times but, after this last time, will never return. If you go for the non buffet, the food tends to be much fresher but also much more expensive. Some of the staff is very unfriendly and obviously, very overworked.  They run an all you can eat special on Thurday and Friday mornings. They also run a sepate special on all you can eat sushi.  It seamed like a really good deal. The problem is they give you the old meat for that special.  There have been times where I had to literally leave it because it was rotten meat. The reason I say I will never return is because this last time all I ate that day was the all you can eat sushi. It was particularly rotten that day and a few hours later, I was in the ER with food poisoning.  It was the worst day of my life. This place should be closed down.

I waited 2 full minutes as he wrapped sandwiches, stirred soup and continued to ignore me. I won&#39;t stand for this type of treatment so I turned on my heels and walked out.

He should have just looked me in the eye and said something such as &#34;I&#39;ll be with you in a moment sir&#34;. That&#39;s it and I would have waited.

The huge menu had us intrigued but in the end you can find better. First of all, the prices on their website are outdated by .15 to .25 which isn&#39;t terrible but should be corrected. Second, the menu doesn&#39;t specify certain things like what&#39;s in the combos or what is in certain items. 

One thing we ordered was the Super Gyro Sandwich, which we assumed was a bigger gyro. What we got was an average size gyro with cooked onions, sliced canned mushrooms, and a side of watery tzatziki. Is this how they make their gyros or is this the &#39;super&#39; version? Total failure, no self respecting gyro lover would dare think of putting mushrooms on a gyro let alone CANNED. No tomatoes? You cooked the onions? My Italian beef and sausage combo wasn&#39;t bad but the sausage didn&#39;t snap when bitten, it just fell apart almost like ground beef. That sounds gross having typed it out so I&#39;ll stop thinking further on it. My dad&#39;s Ribeye Steak Sandwich wasn&#39;t great either but I had a feeling he go for the cheesesteak instead. 

Fortunately I live much closer to a bunch of other restaurants with far better options. Portillo&#39;s, Costas, Nikko&#39;s.... the list goes on and on. The fact that I&#39;m giving 3 stars after having the most disappointing gyro in the Chicago area shows how kind I am. If you favor cost over quality you probably won&#39;t mind."

First off, they have a gigantic menu, and everything is cheap! For under $8 I got the gyro combo meal (comes with fries and a drink). If you don&#39;t like gyros, no worries. They have all sorts of sandwiches, soups, hot dogs, burgers, salads, and more! They also have daily specials (Monday is gyro day!). I thought the gyro was pretty delicious - a little salty, but still good. The pita and the sauce were also very good. The fries come out piping hot, and are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just how I like &#39;em! 

The inside and outside aren&#39;t much to brag about. It&#39;s a very small place - you can eat in, but it was pretty cold and there are not a lot of seats. Next time I will probably take my good to go. However if you want a cheap, not-so-great-for-you meal, this is a good place to go."

The owner is always friendly when we are ordering and eating, and always chats with us. The gyros are delicious! And I love Mediterranean food, it is my absolute favorite. They give a HUGE portion of tender meat with just enough Tsaziki and a soft fluffy pita bread. The fries are good too, and they give a large portion with the combo meal.

For my first visit, I went with the Italian beef sandwich, dipped, with hot peppers and cheese.  Great flavor, tasty gravy, and I ended up using a knife and fork.  My husband tried the Philly steak sandwich, and was sorely disappointed.  He ogled my Italian beef until I had to share.

Lots of variety on the menu, they make some &#34;creative&#34; gyros combinations - like the &#34;super gyro sandwich&#34; - made with gyro meat, mushrooms, grilled onions, mozzarella cheese and tzatziki sauce.

Lots of fried varieties of side dishes - I&#39;m a sucker for mushrooms, but they have mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers as well.

Prices are very reasonable, especially if you go for one of the daily specials, which are $2.99 Monday-Thursday."

When you compare sandwich places that count their slices of meat for each sandwich versus this place, you&#39;re getting a lot more meat for the buck. Sandwiches are pretty basic here, but you get a lot of quality sliced meat and combinations.

I&#39;ve had the beef encounter, beef and cheddar as well as the refrigerator. They pile the meat on so high in all of these especially the refrigerator. You can practically make two meals out it for about the same price as Jimmy Johns or Subway would charge for one average sandwich. 

This place is also nice to sit down at for a bit, eat and then head next door to the Catlow theater to see a flick."

I&#39;m a long-ago resident of Barrington, in town for my high school reunion, and my jaw literally dropped when I saw Boloney&#39;s while driving by on Main Street. The nostalgic appeal of a lunch at Boloney&#39;s for old times&#39; sake got me in the door, but if I ever planned on returning permanently, I would honestly be a frequent customer here. Maybe you want more details as to why?

1.  Huge portions of meat. Whether in your sandwich or a &#34;scoop&#34; atop your salad, the protein served with each meal is about twice what you&#39;d normally expect. For instance, my two Turkey Salad scoops were nearly a cup each (together, counted as one order though).
2. Prices that belong in another decade. Much like the wood paneling and other décor at Boloney&#39;s hearken back to the &#39;80s, the prices are like something out of the &#39;90s. See reason #1 and think about that for a moment!
3. The small-town, &#34;neighborhood regular spot&#34; feeling that can&#39;t be faked. Yes, it&#39;s tacky as all get out and I love it! If you enjoy feeling right at home in a casual setting, this will make your meal extra cozy.

I probably paid about 9 dollars for my lunch, and it was more than I needed. It was tasty, too. 

Basically, you don&#39;t have to &#34;get the draw&#34; because of nostalgic reasons, but it certainly doesn&#39;t hurt. Try stepping in to Boloney&#39;s for some popcorn before a matinee at the Catlow next door, and you will relive that great Main Street experience once again."

It has been here for years. Prior to me moving to the area over 30 years ago. In that time, I have eaten there maybe a dozen times - it is a small hole in the wall beside the Catlow Theater, so it is easy to forget about. Still, the interior is exactly the same as it was 30 years ago. Inside, it is 1987...the Berlin Wall is still in place, the Los Angeles Olympics are still a recent memory....and videos of A-Ha&#39;s &#34;Take on Me&#34; still play on the 27 inch tube television built into the wall (we thought it was huge in the 1980s.

You order from the same high school kids who worked there 30 years ago and who are still 16 years old - bag of chips (variety the same as back then), you get your soda (giant Styrofoam cup that will be here long after you and I are gone) and then you order your sandwich. Don&#39;t get me wrong - the place is good, it is an experience, it is nostalgic....they have like 40 different sandwich choices - all cold I believe - each sandwich is about 4 to 5 inches thick...most of it meat, usually with shredded ice berg lettuce flying everywhere. The sandwiches are huge by today&#39;s standards...in the 1980&#39;s they were so big it was almost a joke - like some child put a whole ham between two pieces of bread.

Honestly, I should also say that when you can&#39;t get out of a Jimmy Johns for under $11 bucks...Bolognys gives you a hell of a lot more bang for the buck. Sandwich artists aside, Bolonys reveals Subway for the generic fleecing it is...Bolonys offers a quality, albeit ridiculously proportioned product at a good price.

The cool thing about this place is that if you go next door to the Catlow Theater for a movie (also ridiculously cheap - about $3 bucks I think) you can order from Bolognes and take your food into the movie theater on a tray....I know places like iPic and such offer in theater seat dining now, but this was an INSANE concept back in the day and when you can do a sandwich, bag of chips and a bucket of soda as well as a movie for the same as a sandwich and drink at Jimmy Johns...why not!?!?!? Would someone from outside of town who didn&#39;t grow up with it, get it? I don&#39;t know...I think everyone would like the sandwiches though."

Nope, not here. At Boloney&#39;s it&#39;s just the right amount for a single sandwich. Boloney&#39;s is a tiny sandwich shop in the middle of downtown Barrington. When you walk in, it&#39;s a straight shot to the register. They have menus on the wall so you can figure out what you want before you order. There&#39;s a handful of tables within the actual place, but during the day you can also head over to the lobby of the Catlow Theater next door and there&#39;s additional tables there. The decor of the place is straight out of the 80s/early 90s with the vinyl table covers and creaky chairs. They also have tiny TVs playing music videos from the 80s. Nice touch.

Food: Like everyone else has said, the sandwiches here are huge. They literally slice out a pile of each kind of meat and just slap it down in layers between two slices of a kaiser roll. They need to pin toothpicks in them just to keep it upright. A lot of times I can&#39;t even get a complete bite of the whole sandwich. I need to eat the top half and bottom half separately. I bet they&#39;re used to people not being able to finish their food because they just have a stack of containers you can grab yourself so you can pack up the leftovers. Another unique thing is they have a different type of salad dressing that comes with most of their sandwiches. I never really dipped my sandwiches in French dressing before, but it&#39;s actually pretty damn good. I&#39;ve tried a bunch of their sandwiches and my favorite ones are the beef ones.

The Refrigerator - This is the first item that just jumps out at you when looking over the menu because it literally has every type of cold cut in it. At some point the bottom layer of the bread will somehow disappear and you will just be taking bites out of a stack of meat in your hands. 

Beef Encounter - When I&#39;m not so hungry and don&#39;t feel like taking down the fridge, I usually go for their beef sandwich. Half roast beef and half corned beef. Good stuff.

Beef and Cheddar - When I&#39;m in the mood for a hot sandwich, this is definitely my go to. The Italian beef is actually really flavorful and I love how they give you a cup of melted cheddar and a cup of au jus on the side so you can just dip every bite. 

Overall, when I&#39;m in the mood for a deli sandwich during the work week, Boloney&#39;s is the place to go in the Barrington area. Come hungry."

I mean, it&#39;s not, but it should be! 

Boloney&#39;s will make you rethink what a sandwich could and should be. Meat upon meat stacked high on bread, with mountains of lettuce and tomato and all the fixins you could think of! My personal favorite sandwiches are the Lily Muenster (Turkey, Muenster cheese, lettuce, tomato, sliced egg, and ranch dressing served on a pita), The Chicken of the Sea (Tuna salad and egg salad with lettuce, tomato, and American cheese served on white bread), and the Big Bird made with the turkey salad instead of the sliced turkey. If you go home hungry, you should go to the doctor, seriously, there might be something wrong with you. Ordering double meat is not for the faint of heart! If you are a newbie and not a big eater, ask for a half portion. It&#39;s not that small, but it is still smaller than the normal portion. They have a great selection of side dishes made in house, as well as chips, cookies, and Boloney&#39;s popcorn! This is a true Barrington gem and definitely a sandwich lover&#39;s paradise."

The meat in the Fonda Pita was abundant, but it was bland and the onion cucumber sauce was way too thick. The Mini Sub was decent, but nothing I couldn&#39;t make myself. Just a bunch of cold cuts piled on bread. 

If you&#39;re not a big eater, splitting one sandwich is the way to go. You can eat right in the restaurant, or have it delivered to you in the theater. If you get the sandwich delivered in the theater, I think it might be a little tough to eat- there&#39;s no tables so you eat off a tray on your lap...in the dark. The restaurant does start filling up close to show time, so get there a little early to make sure you find a table."

So much so that I tried (and sadly, failed) the Lucky&#39;s challenge in Wrigleyville, and lets just say I didn&#39;t eat a sandwich for at least a week afterwards :)

 Anyway, this was the topic of conversation with a coworker of mine who lives in Barrington. He told me that I HAVE to come to Boloneys to see how large the sandwiches are. After checking out some photos of these monstrosities they call sandwiches here, I made the trek to the furthest reaches of Lake Cook Road and beyond to pick up some dinner for my wife and I. 

I called in my order since I had my daughter with me and didn&#39;t want to wait with her. Turns out at 3pm the place is empty so it was great timing. I ordered the Refrigerator because, well, that&#39;s just me to order the biggest sandwich they have. Also picked up a Chick n&#39; of the Sea sandwich for the wife. When the woman handed me the bag I was in complete shock at the weight of these two sandwiches. Needless to say, it was a long ride home in the car with two giant sammies in the seat beside me. 

I&#39;m pretty sure the only time I&#39;ve complained about too much meat on a sandwich before was at Carnegie Deli in NYC. I mean, come on, it&#39;s not even a sandwich as much as it is a heaping pile of meat btw two tiny slices of rye bread. 

Well here in Barrington, they have adopted the same concept with the Refrigerator. They use french bread so it has more consistency than the rye does at Carnegie, but this sandwich is a Meatapolooza. There must be a pound of meat alone on the fridge, as if my fridge had a 1/4 lb each of roast beef, corned beef, ham and turkey and I made one giant sandwich with it. There&#39;s not too many sandwiches that I have a difficult time biting into, but the Refrigerator  definitely got the best of me and I had to take it apart after a few bites.

Quality meats and cheeses, and a great value at $8.50. My wife loved her egg and tuna salad combo, and she also had to deconstruct the thing in order to eat it. Expect leftovers!!!!

I&#39;m looking forward to coming back here with the wife only so we can catch a movie at the theater next door. This seems like such a great concept of having an affordable sandwich restaurant combined with a movie theater. Movies are all 5 bucks and they show films that have not yet been released on DVD....sold."

I ordered the &#34;Chick &#39;n&#39; of the Sea&#34; which is a combination of egg salad and tuna salad, American cheese, mayo, lettuce and very thinly sliced red onion served on whole wheat. The sandwich was super fresh as fresh could be- but in my opinion, the egg salad really &#34;made&#34; the taste of the sandwich a cut above any other sandwich shops that I have been to in the past. It reminded me of the home made egg salad from my youth. When I visit again, I will ask them to substitute Swiss cheese for the American cheese just for a flavor experiment.

It&#39;s the next day after lunch and I am still in a feel good comfort food mood from my sandwich; it was that good!!!

People seated near us were enjoying a &#34;crabmeat salad&#34; sandwich which looked just mouthwateringly delicious and something that I&#39;d definitely like to try in the future.

Our sandwiches came with a pickle on the side even though on the menu board it says that a pickle is extra. (correction- it appears sandwiches come with a pickle SPEAR, where as a whole pickle is extra)

They feature Coca-Cola products, but offer a choice of fountain or canned sodas... Your choice!

Of note is a large city parking lot right across the street which makes it easy to pop in for a nosh. Boloney&#39;s also have quite an extensive catering menu (check their web site for details)- I can&#39;t imagine how off the hook it would be to have Boloney&#39;s cater a business luncheon or special occasion. Now that I think about it- Boloney&#39;s catering might be JUST the solution to &#34;what to share&#34; at holiday parties!

In summary- this is one of those family run places that I so love to patronize, it has basically everything going for it and if you haven&#39;t visited them yet, do yourself a favor and put them on your &#34;to try soon&#34; list."

There&#39;s street parking available right outside the shop.

REUBENESQUE SANDWICH - THE BEST Rueben sandwich I&#39;ve ever had.  I&#39;m not a big sandwich person, but this is one seriously good sandwich.  It&#39;s piled high with meat (oh so thinly sliced and delicious corned beef) and topped with saurkraut, Thousand Island dressing and swiss cheese on rye. Although it was a tall sandwich, it was still pretty easy to bite into.  Good value for $7.50!"

Food- We stopped in here because we were still hungry after &#34;eating&#34; at some crappy place called Near.  The dagwood was huge.  I split the dagwood into 5 portions and ate a piece for lunch each day.  We didn&#39;t have the chili but we saw some regular old-timers order it and it was about as tall as i was.  

Decor- The place is definitely a hole in the wall place, but hole in the walls are usually the pinnacle of culinary deliciousness.  The menu is written chalkboard style which i thought was a nice homestyle feature that really piqued the customers interest.  

Service- Everyone is nice.  Can&#39;t comment too much on service but the lady at the counter seemed nice."

Its a bit cramped but you can always go next door to Catlow and sit and eat. Shannon (Manager/owner) is always very helpful. They get busy for lunch so you may have to wait a few minutes but I think the most I&#39;ve ever waited was 10 minutes. You can always call ahead too. 
I&#39;d love to take one of these sandwiches across the street to Subway and say HERE, THIS is a sandwich! Boloney&#39;s is easily 4 times the meat that Subway charges $5 for. 
Personal favorites: Chicken of the Sea, Lily Muenster."

If you&#39;re going to the Catlow for a movie and you wanna get fed, stop at Baloney&#39;s first. You can either arrive early and dine in, or order &#34;to go&#34; and take it in to the theater with you. The sandwich shop is attached to the theater, and like the Catlow, it is DATED. In the best kind of way though- like &#34;they don&#39;t make &#39;em like this anymore.&#34; 
I ordered a chili dog and boy was I surprised to see my plate. I was expecting a hot dog with a little chili and some cheese and onions. You know, hand held. What I got was definitely fork and knife material. They laid out the bun, then a huge Vienna hot dog, and then smothered it with chili. Like the whole plate was covered. They provided me with a fork, knife, and spoon for this behemoth. And it was delicious! I have to say though that I probably wouldn&#39;t order it to take into the theater with me- too messy! Maybe I would get a regular hot dog and a cup of chili and DIY it. 
My mom had a roast beef sandwich which was delicious, and my dad had the Lily Munster, which I believe had turkey and muenster cheese in a pita. I&#39;m not a fan of what goes in that sandwich, so I didn&#39;t try any. 
The girls who were working that night were super sweet and patient. As a member of the food service industry, I know how frustrating it can be dealing with first timers or indecisive customers during a dinner rush. But they were totally accommodating- answered all of our questions and even got a sample of tuna salad for my mom to try before she made her decision. 
Prices were really decent for the quality and amount of food we received. I&#39;d prefer a sandwich from here over the typical movie fare of nachos or cold unkosher hot dogs."

How about old Hollywood head shots? Eating in the lobby of a historic theater? Maybe you are an ex-vegan like me who needs to make up for lost time by eating tons of amazing egg salad sandwiches (but not the kind that has bacon in it, because you still don&#39;t eat meat), or you love sandwich shops that make grilled cheese for your kid, even if it isn&#39;t on the menu. If any of these apply, or if you&#39;re looking for a way to eat cookies next to an Alfonso Iannelli sculpture, you should grab lunch at Baloney&#39;s.

It&#39;s true that the main dining room is cramped, high chairs are hard to find if you don&#39;t know where to look, and the interior of the main area is a bit dingy.

I ordered a &#34;Ruebenesque&#34; sandwich. It was after 1:30PM and wasn&#39;t too busy - I ordered then went to wash my hands, sat down and was waiting for a while and thinking, &#34;why is it taking quite this long for a rueben sandwich?&#34;

Then it came, and I understood why - it was huge. The only place I&#39;ve seen a larger sandwich is Carnegie Deli in NYC and you pay twice as much there. For $10.17 (including tax) I got a can of soda pop, a bag of chips and a rueben sandwich with a heaping amount of lean corned beef, sauerkraut, swiss cheese and just the right amount of 1,000 Island dressing on two perfect slices of marble rye.

But do you notice something odd about the reviews? Folks are saying much more about the size of the sandwiches than whether they taste good.  Regretfully, I find the sandwiches fairly lackluster.  Cold cuts stacked sky-high does not make a sandwich better, just larger.  Several things I tried were way too bland, enormous but bland.  When I think of truly great sandwiches, the winners are Fausto&#39;s (Arlington Hts), Cap&#39;n Nemo&#39;s (Winnetka and Chicago), Dario&#39;s (Palatine) and Salerno&#39;s (Mt Prospect).

My love for Boloney&#39;s is pretty tremendous. Whether it&#39;s the cutesy throwback charm of their Main St digs (yup, they literally reside on Main St), the adorable ladies that work the sammie order counter (whatcanwegetcha, Honey?), their historic allegiance to the adjoining Catlow Theater, or the undeniably delicious - and tremendous - sandwiches, my heart grows even more fond of them the years that go by. 

Whether you&#39;re stopping in for easy breezy takeout, eating-in at the Ma &#39;n Pa style kitchen tables or taking your sandwich over to mangia on while you watch the latest onscreen flick at The Catlow, Boloney&#39;s ain&#39;t disappointin&#39;&#39;, I guarantee it. 

Piled super high with the freshest ingredients, there&#39;s pretty much nothing that beats my favorite, the Batmanwich! Ham, muenster cheese, tomato, sprouts and Italian dressing on your choice of fresh bread, it&#39;s the white to my rice... the ebony to my ivory... the wind beneath my wings. Swoon. Other delights like the Dagwood - ham, turkey, salami, swiss, 1000 island dressing on an onion roll - or the Lily Muenster - turkey, sliced egg, muenster cheese, tomato and lettuce with ranch stuffed in a pita pocket - won&#39;t let your sandwich mojo fail you either.

Pros:

- Food is plentiful and the price is reasonable. May not be the highest quality of meats in the sandwich, but its still good. I find myself eating about half a sandwich and then saving the other half for later, so it is a good value from that perspective.
- Location is good. Sign might not be the most noticeable. 
- Service is very good. Always very friendly. 
- Decent amount of seating during lunch time. 

Cons: 

- Tables tend to be dirty. Inside decor is a little old looking. I usually take my order to go rather than stay. Also, the layout of the tables was crowded and had other customers running into me a few times when I did stay to eat.

My first trip to Boloney&#39;s was accidental - I was going to see a movie at the Catlow Theater which is next door / attached to Boloney&#39;s and the friend I was with suggested we get a sandwich to split and eat during the movie.  Huh?  I was intrigued. 

The dining room sure isn&#39;t anything special - a few tables with vinyl tablecloths, and framed headshots of actors covering the walls.  There is a very small TV running music videos non-stop but it&#39;s not loud and it kept my kids entertained while we waited for our sandwiches.  

I nearly always order the Lily Muenster - shaved turkey piled sky high with muenster cheese, lettuce and tomato, and harboiled egg in a pita served with ranch dressing.  There is no way to eat an entire Boloney&#39;s sandwich in one sitting.  They are monstrous!  And if you&#39;re going in to the Catlow to watch the movie, they will deliver it to you on a tray so you can eat while you watch.  But I stop there and get a sandwich for dinner on the nights I don&#39;t feel like cooking too.  

If you&#39;re there for the movie, don&#39;t miss their carmel corn, cheese corn, or the Chicago combo bag too - just the right mix of sweet and tangy and for $3 for a huge tube, you can&#39;t go wrong. Where else can you go in the Chicagoland area and get dinner, popcorn, and a movie for less than $20 a person?  No where.  And there&#39;s no reason to look - Boloney&#39;s is THE BEST sandwich place in the Northwest suburbs, hands down.  Skip the chain stores and head on down to the village of Barrington instead."

It is right next to the historic Catlow theatre, a frequent visit of mine, and you are even allowed to bring their messy sandwiches into the movie!  HUGE and delicious sandwiches for a very low price.  They have pictures of old hollywood movie stars on the walls, play 80s music and have a hoard of cute teapots on display.  Very charming and makes me feel like i&#39;m in an 80s movie. :)"

Family favorites include the reuben, the turkey, and my personal favorite which is half tuna and half egg salad. If you love tuna salad, you will love this! They have the best tuna salad!
The catlow is next door and usually has the best pick of films playing, so you can always plan on grabbing a sandwich.

Baloney&#39;s is attached to the Catlow theater in the center of town and will actually serve you a sandwich in your theater seat.

The restaurant itself is a small storefront with ten or so tables with signed pictures from actors and actresses from American film history but you go there for the amazing array and quality of their sandwiches.  Sandwiches such as the Herman Muenster, Rubenesque, The Big Bird and the colossal Refrigerator are cult favorites.

The sandwiches are all more than generous and you won&#39;t go wrong with any of them. I order the Refrigerator and get an extra cup of the French dressing on the side and then turn it into two meals."

The portions are more than generous and with the multi-meat combos it may actually hurt the flavor balance. When you eat that much of that many different meats at one time it all kind of mushes into one meaty flavor which may not be what you want. 

That being said - all of the ingredients are fresh, good quality and tasty. The more than generous portions make the sandwiches a great value as well as a hearty meal. 

Definitely worth the 5 stars especially in this culinary wasteland that is the burbs."

I second all the nice compliments on portion sizes and DO think they could offer smaller portions and prices as a choice. Really enjoyable movie memorabilia space and there are always a lot of local papers around to read. Very enjoyable front window for observing who are the worst jerk drivers in Barrington - BMW&#39;s ALWAYS win this loser category.

My issue is that the stars drop dramatically the closer you get to movie time and they are just not set up for peaks. What you actually get and what you actually ordered and how long it takes are inverse relationships as movie time approaches. I have seen the money handling and food handling suffer also. Why not prepare some turkey salad plates in advance on a Friday/Saturday night, same for the other big sellers? Everything backs up in there from the movie ticket line to the food counter line.  STILL I am a fan, and it is nice to be able to take your food into the theater.

Pros- reasonable, plentiful, fresh deli with large menu, clean and fast, nice people and we want to support The Catlow.

Cons- backs up at movie times, a Subway might be faster and IS cheaper."

I was sitting in traffic on Main Street in front of the store, wondering about the sandwiches, when I saw a woman walk out of the shop with a BIG bag of sandwiches to-go.

For 7 bucks I got the refridgerator which had ham, turkey, roast beef, cheese, a bunch of other crap, and probably three other animals all cut up. when I picked up the bag to leave I thought they gave me two because of the weight but this was the first sandwich I&#39;ve ordered that uses multiple toothpicks from each end. No matter how hard I squeezed I couldn&#39;t get a full bit into my mouth and it lasted me 2 meals, almost 2 and a half.

We ate outside last weekend, and place a to go order yesterday. They miss-marked the orders, so people at each other&#39;s food (but we dealt), so like everywhere, I&#39;d make sure it&#39;s labeled right before diving in (had this problem elsewhere). 

Slammed them with a 6 person to go order, and they&#39;re still able to take care of regular customers (there is a 6 person table, and 3 4 tops  as well). Someone sat down and didn&#39;t feel they fit their order taken fast enough, so walked out, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;d waited that long (especially given their clearly busy), and he was brought a water right away. I&#39;d have at least tried to get someones attention. I place it more on an impatient, crabby customer than the staff.

Everyone in town knows it and has been to it multiple times. It is wildly popular for breakfast and lunch on the weekends, but honestly, I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table, and usually half that. The restaurant is one room - it has some booths, some tables and a lunch counter. From the ceiling, big model airplanes hang and the dome type ceiling resembles an aircraft hangar. There used to be a lot more planes, but they de-cluttered several years ago. 

I don&#39;t know as I would say this place has become &#34;trendy&#34; but it is a different crowd of people than it was when I was growing up - back then it was a lot of old duffers sitting around reading the paper, now it is busier, more families and 30/40-somethings. It changed hands several years ago and thankfully, the owners kept the basic concept and interior...however, they did clean it, something it really needed. The menu is fairly extensive and has a wide array of breakfast items, as well as lunch items (sandwiches and wraps mostly). With the whole brunch obsession these days, the place is more popular than ever....the food is ok, pretty tough to screw up pancakes or a turkey sandwich. They have tried to dress up the food a bit as well. It has moved over the years from a standard bacon and egg place, to the menu of what amounts to a Greek breakfast restaurant.

You come for the experience and because it is comfortable. Inside, it is always the weekend and everything is perfect with the world. The prices are market competitive....but the days of the $3 Denny&#39;s grand slam are well and truly over."

It was closer to the high school that I was going to so my daughter and I decided to check this place out. The hostess/server was friendly and we were seated at a booth right away. The glasses of water and coffee were served immediately too but other than these 2 quick actions, the service was slow and unattentive. I had the Eggs(over easy) with pancakes and bacon meal while my daughter had her scrambled eggs and sausage links. The pancakes were delicious and everything else on our plates were cooked well. The place is really old and I have nothing against that but they should be on top of the cleanliness specially on the floors and the bathroom area. The floors smelled like dirty, wet rags and even though the bathrooms are downstairs from the dining area, the whole place just didn&#39;t smell clean.

This is a fairly typical diner, only open for breakfast and lunch. Over the years I have heard great things about it, but think this was my first visit. I went with my wife and my father-in-law.

They have an extensive menu including all sorts of breakfasts, burgers, sandwiches, wraps and some entrees. It was noon when we arrived and I was torn between their burger, which I have heard wonderful things about, and their corned beef hash and eggs. Everything is homemade so I opted for the corned beef hash. You get a healthy serving of hash, breakfast potatoes and eggs any style. The corned beef was fantastic. My wife had a Reuben and said the same thing.

I mentioned friendly - the owner goes around from table to table and may sit with you for a whole. We had a long chat with him about his business. He loves what he does and takes pride in his restaurant. After we talked, he had someone bring us each a slice of pound cake, on the house.

Aside from the overall great time, there were a number of service members, in uniform, who were on leave and said they always come here when they come home. Talking to them, hearing their stories of being in Iraq and Afghanistan were both shocking and exciting. My point here is that everyone, customers included, feel at home here and everyone is comfortable to talk to each other."

Canteen does that. The décor inside, the interesting variety on the menu, the potato chip &#34;starters&#34; at lunch. All good stuff.

I asked my waitress whether I should choose the Corned Beef sandwich or the French Dip. She encouraged me to order the CB. Now, my kind of Corned Beef is warm and sliced thinly. Warm it was, but this is more of the thicker sliced CB kind of sandwich. I asked the waitress which it was and she was spot on - but I ordered it anyway based on her recommendation. For me, I still prefer the thinly sliced stuff... but if you&#39;re a Corned Beef lover regardless of how thick it is - this CB is for you. It was very flavorful and the sandwich was actually large enough to take 1/2 of it home and still feel quite full.

I also had soup with lunch - that Greek Lemon soup that starts with an &#34;A&#34; and has eighty-three letters following it. It was quite good too. 

I had passed Canteen any number of times sometimes it looked too busy to go in, other times I just wasn&#39;t hungry. But I&#39;m glad I finally checked it out - quite a classic breakfast and lunch joint that one doesn&#39;t see much of anymore."

This place is obviously a local favorite (complete with regulars who good-naturedly hassle the waitstaff).The dining area is small, so don&#39;t come at a peak meal time unless you&#39;re prepared to wait. We came for breakfast at 8 am on a Saturday and got a seat, but it filled up. 

The atmosphere is family-friendly and delightfully (and unpretentiously) small-town. The &#34;canteen&#34; scheme comes complete with dozens of airplanes hanging from the ceiling, which the toddler loved. 

The BBS crepes (blueberry, banana, strawberry) were generous, although unspectacular. The crepes were fine, and the serving of fruit was surprising. There must have been a whole banana on one crepe, several fresh strawberries on another, and a healthy serving of blueberries on the third. Standard crepes, but the fruit stands up to the price tag.

The Argentine Benedict was great - eggs poached to perfection, the homemade Chimichurri sauce was a little spicy. The steaks were perfect, and the potatoes were good but standard.   

All in all, a good breakfast. The prices may be a little ambitious, but I&#39;ll pay a little extra for the friendly waitstaff and comfortable vibe."

Really good eggs benedict and the dish with artichoke hearts is pretty good too, especially if you are debating whether you want to walk home!"

Once I removed the sweetened saucy eggs the stuffed french toast was okay.  Typical Greek owned restaurant in what used to be a building that looks like a mini airplane hanger.  Interesting model airplanes hanging from the ceiling.  I could tell that our waitress wished she were somewhere else.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend.

Sour cherry crepes, ham (right off the bone) and fluffy scrambled eggs, fresh-squeezed orange juice, and strong coffee were all satisfying, if not mind-blowing. They&#39;re not reinventing the wheel; it&#39;s comfort food in a diner atmosphere.

There were maybe 5 other tables sitting when we sat down, but it took at least 5-7 minutes just for the server to bring us coffee. 
We ordered basic eggs and bacon/sausage, which came out in 3 minutes, clearly showing that the food is not prepared to order. 
My wife ate 1 sausage link because they were not good. The bacon was hard and tasted like it was microwaved. The potatoes were cold, oily and soggy. Finally, the entire restaurant smelled like 3 day old garbage.

Me: You&#39;re open today?
He: OF COURSE we&#39;re open!

Done and done. We arrived to a full parking lot, a bustling restaurant and a hearty welcome from the same man who had answered the phone. We were situated in a big ol&#39; booth made for sprawling (love!) and quickly took to the books, err menus, before us. I made a decision based on a combination of gut reaction and survival necessity: The Croque Madame French Toast. As it turns out, a Croque Madame tailored for breakfast is every bit as decadent as my &#39;bad girl&#39; lunch staple (check out my photo - isn&#39;t she pretty?). I couldn&#39;t resist complementing my savory selection with a sweet side so I added a pancake for a nominal fee. This is what last suppers are made of! NomNOMnomNoMnoM.

We liked the planes hanging from the ceiling and the movie posters on the walls. The food is average and so is the service. A previous review we read mentioned a musty smell.  We noticed that too.  It smelled like dirty mop water. The previous review said the smell was strong enough to make the reviewer nauseous.  We didn&#39;t feel it was that bad,  but it&#39;s definitely noticeable and distracting. The waitress was not the best. She basically just brought out our food.  No personality or friendliness.  The young man clearing plates and filling drinks was nicer.  Their smoker was running outside and we were curious how good the BBQ is.  Maybe we&#39;ll try takeout BBQ next time we&#39;re in the area.  The bottom line is that the Canteen is pricey for the quality of the food and not worth a drive.

It was a one-hour drive, and I got to know how close we were to grandpa&#39;s by the landmarks along the way.  Seeing the Canteen meant we were in downtown Barrington, and no, we were not there yet.  My dad used to beg my mom to come here, but she&#39;d cringe at the dingy exterior.  Since I was a kid, I was more interested in stopping at McDonald&#39;s for a happy meal.  And, like most things, I agreed with my mom on this one.  

My first visit to the Canteen was today - with my mom, of all people!  We stopped on our way to Volo Antique Mall for brunch.  My dad, I hear, is totally jealous.

I couldn&#39;t decide between breakfast or lunch, and lunch usually wins when there&#39;s a creamy soup on the menu.  I had the chicken swiss melt with a side of cream of chicken rice soup.

The soup was disappointing.  It was very creamy and lemony, but there wasn&#39;t any chicken and hardly any rice.  And since I&#39;m trying to watch my weight, and what I eat, cream soup was an indulgence.  So, I was pissed that I wasted calories on it!  My sandwich was just okay, and it was a little bland.  The chicken could have used some seasoning.  And, not that I needed it, but I was surprised that the sandwiches came with fries, soup or salad, instead of the fries and soup. 

My mom had the taffy apple waffle and kept talking about how good it was until we reached Volo.  The waffle appeared homemade, no frozen business here, and the apples were gooey, covered with cinnamon and caramel.  The waffle was also topped with pecans and caramel syrup.  I can confidently say that the waffles here are worthwhile, as my mom was very happy with her breakfast.

As for me, I should&#39;ve gotten the frittata.  Probably more healthy, and breakfast seems to be more of a specialty.

We received great service.  My mom had a question about the banana pancakes (are they in the batter or on top?), and the waitress very quickly asked someone in the kitchen.  The Canteen is a very tiny restaurant, with about 14 tables and a counter with stools.  There were old movie posters on the wall, and my mom couldn&#39;t stop complaining that the &#34;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&#34; poster didn&#39;t fit in.  I couldn&#39;t help but agree.  That, and the random Reebok hockey stick.  It smelled a bit musty inside as well.

And when I headed to the bathroom, I had to walk down a long staircase.  There is no way to get to the bathroom if you use a wheelchair, and it&#39;ll still be difficult if you use a walker or cane.  So if you&#39;re wheelchair-bound, you might have to hold it til you can get elsewhere.

I&#39;d go back for breakfast, but I don&#39;t recommend the lunch menu."

There was a large selection of breakfast and lunch items - eggs, pancakes, sandwiches. I had the ham and eggs. The portions were good, but both the eggs and the potatoes tasted a little &#34;off,&#34; a bit like the cooking oil was turning rancid.

I encouraged two of my friends to join me for our 1st adventure there. I&#39;m all for local restaurants, we were expecting amazing, we got much less. The waitress had zero personality. She was slow and even though we were the ONLY people in the place she plopped the pot of coffee on the table so that we could serve ourselves, guessing so that she could focus on playing with her cell phone at the counter. We got an omelette, pancakes and waffles. Definitely not worth the $30 bill. Last but not least, here was an odd sewer smell. I see that other folks have written about that as well.

As for the food, well... Ummm... Yeah, my coffee was terrible, blech! But, the menu is inspired. My hubbins ordered the Argentinian benedict and said &#34;it&#39;s good, not amazing.&#34; He did tear into the perfectly prepared breakfast potatoes, though. I ordered regular eggs benedict and it was kind of lousy and lacking flavor. The eggs were poached beautifully and the Canadian bacon was nice. But, the English muffin was an awful puck (offensive to the rest of the meal, actually). The hollandaise was creamy, but someone forgot to add lemon juice and it was sorely missed. My side of fruit was fresh, ripe, and sweet.

I&#39;d return just for the kind treatment and the atmosphere -- but I&#39;d only order the basics off the menu."

The only reason I&#39;m not giving them 4 stars right off the bat is because of the service.  Yes, it is a small restaurant but they get busy &amp; there were only 3 servers working the dining room.  We were there on a weekend morning, a typically busy time for any breakfast place, so I think they would have been better off having at least one more server.  Perhaps someone called out for the day.  Either way we waited a very long time to place our order and the only time our server came back was to drop off the bill &amp; get us a box.  Actually, I believe one of the bus boys brought us the box.  But I won&#39;t let this one time deter us from a return visit.

That kind of longevity can only mean one of two things: a) there is no other breakfast restaurant available in the town of Barrington, or, b) Canteen is doing something and doing it well for more than 60+ years. Kudos! 

I can tell you this... it&#39;s definitely one of my favorite brunch stop-ins. From the ultra small - but cozy - dining room, the familiar smiling faces always there every time I stop in, to the consistently tasty and fully stocked menu, this is a family affair operation and they just get. it. right. 

Mix Greek brekkie favs like feta-laced Omelettes and piled-high sandwiches on greek toast with nom worthy Bananas Foster Crepes, Pecan Belgian Waffles and crazy delicious Taffy Apple French Toast for a truly well-rounded morning marathon of all things mouthwatering. Excusez moi, is it hot in here or is it just me?

While the interior is very quaint , I was completely turned off by the food that came to our table.  When it finally got to our table.

I ordered a caprese panini, tomatoes, basil and buffalo mozzarella with the unique twist of being grilled on greek bread.

Our waitress was young and seemed confused, nearly shell-shocked, by everything that was going on around her.

When the food finally arrived after far too long a wait, my sandwich was cold.  The &#34;Grilled&#34; part was several sad, slightly beige lines that had been pressed into the bread by the panini press.  Clearly not long enough to actually toast the bread.

The sandwich filling (basil, tomato and buffalo mozz) looked a little light, so I opened the sandwich up (see photo).
I had a couple slices of tomato, along with an end piece, 3 petite leaves of basil that didn&#39;t look all that appetizing and several clumps of melted mozzarella cheese (not buffalo mozzarella).

On tasting it, this turned out to be a truly disgusting sandwich.

The kitchen staff should be repremanded and the owner should be ashamed for letting that kind of food even be presented to a customer.

Wrong ingredients, skimpy ingredients, cooked wrong, served slow and cold.

We have had breakfast at Canteen before as well, but frankly it was nothing to write home about.

This visit seals it.  We will not be back to Canteen.

Instead, I recommend the likes of Egg Harbor, McGonagles pub or Ambrosia etc.. for your next breakfast or lunch outting in Barrington."

The food was phenomenal. Not greasy at all. We did have to wait but it was Sunday morning. The crowds made the restaurant extremely loud which I do not like. And the wait was substantial to get our order in. But we could see our waitress was hurrying around with a 10-person party. She was courteous and very upbeat for the amount of running around.

However after going the last couple years I started to notice a really foul spoiled milk mildewed mop kind of smell which I mentioned to the hostess each time  hoping it was just an accident but after the third time I decided they don&#39;t really care. The smell and attitude have not improved despite suggestions to them that the smell made me nauseous and indicated poor sanitary conditions.  So after three years of this awful smell hoping that they would start cleaning better and three complaints to the hostess as recently as a week ago when I actually decided to walk out of the restaurant without eating, I decided it&#39;s time to give up this place since they have no intention of changing. If I get a response to this by the owner apologizing and telling me that he will start to pay attention to customer feedback and to get rid of the foul smile I will gladly try one more time because the food is pretty good but not good enough to put up with the horrible odor every time I walk in.

It seems people either love the place or hate it.  The owner is always at the door to greet you when you walk in and seat you.  The decor is funky, I&#39;m not really sure what the theme is supposed to be.  

The ham off the bone is absolutely defuckinglicious.  I could eat it for 3 meals a day.  The eggs are always cooked the way you want them.  The potatos are good.  I&#39;ve had the gyro skillet which was very good too, although it wasn&#39;t the gyro meat off the spit..

Not only are they ALWAYS open, they are always friendly and the food is always great.  This is a diner in the classic sense of the word.

I love the Big Fat Greek Breakfast - the Zorba Omelette is my favorite.  Mmmm...feta cheese, spinach, and tomatoes.  LOVE!

I hear there is a new Eggs Benedict called the Falafel Benedict - so I know where I&#34;m having breakfast this Sunday!"

It is a cute little divey kitchy Greeky diner in downtown-ish Barrington. We went there for break-lunch some random day during the week.  Coffee is good, food is decent, and prices are moderate. Was I bowled over? No, but I also wasn&#39;t expecting to be. I honestly can&#39;t even remember what I ordered, but I know everyone in my group was happy with our meals. If you&#39;re in the area and aren&#39;t feelin&#39; Egg Harbor, then head over to Canteen - they may just surprise you!"

I&#39;ve been on the hunt for fresh corned beef hash, and due to reviews on here we went. It&#39;s so very delicious! Fresh, crispy, lots of beef. We&#39;ll be back. 
We ordered very basic food. My husband had the ham off the bone and two over medium eggs, with pancakes. I&#39;m not a fan of pancakes, frankly I just don&#39;t get them. But the looked really light and fluffy, and they were. The potatoes, another thing I&#39;m not usually a fan of, were very good. Cubes with onions and green peppers. The only down side was they were room tempature.
The service was very good, it&#39;s very cute and homey inside. And did i mention? The best corned beef hash I&#39;ve had in years!!"

I decided to try the croque Madame French toast. It was awesome! Brie-stuffed French toast with ham and an egg on the top with a drizzle of sweet honey mustard. Really good!

They offer a full menu although I must admit I always order breakfast. 

From savory/sweet crepes, frittatas, awesome skillets and enormous omelets. This past weekend I ordered scrambled eggs and Canadian bacon crepe with Hollandaise Sauce. I think the sauce is great. Maybe a little thicker than you are used to but it is nice that it is not runny. My old man always gets the Gypsy Skillet which is his absolute favorite. Of course they do the old classics as well but will also put a new twist on them if you are open to it.

I was really hoping it would be good because my boyfriend had never been here before and it was my suggestion to come here.

It started off ok.  The problems started when we got our food.  Our waitress was foreign and must have not understood English well because she messed up our order.  I asked for 2 of the same kids meals (the chocolate chip pancakes).  She only rang up one.  When she came over with the food, I asked her about the other meal and she said &#34;Ok I will have them make it right now.&#34;  She did not return until the pancake was ready.  She was basically standing by the kitchen waiting for it for about 8 minutes.  

This was annoying because we needed other things to enjoy our meals at the time and she was not around to get them for us.  I had asked her for another plate so I could split the pancakes that I did have between my girls so they could both start eating while we were waiting.  She never brought it.  I ended up taking my skillet off the plate so I could do that.  

My food was incorrect.  It was supposed to come with green peppers which is one of my favorite parts and it didn&#39;t.  This was not the waitresses fault but she didn&#39;t come back for 8 minutes so by then the skillet was cold...and I still had to wait for them to heat up the peppers...  My boyfriends steak skillet was so peppery that he couldn&#39;t eat it.  He said he was burping up pepper all day (TMI I know).

The chocolate chip pancakes were nasty!  I might have stolen a couple of bites... It tasted like they used Aldi brand imitation chocolate chips.  It did not even taste like real chocolate.  I didn&#39;t know that it was possible to mess up something so simple.

I WILL NEVER RETURN.  It was the waste of a good morning, a waste of $30 and a whole buncha calories... Definitely not worth it."

They did change their potatoes to be a bit more &#34;Greek&#34; but that I can deal with. It&#39;s a pretty typical breakfast place. That&#39;s the one thing that downtown Barrington seems to have in abundance. I&#39;ve never had any problems with service or the food. On Saturday/Sunday mornings there might be a wait, but it&#39;s worth it. I love their skillets. Definitely give it a try."

Today I had the Hawaii-5-0 Frittata (bacon, cheese, pineapple, and ham on an open-faced omelette), which also comes with a plate of fried potatoes and your choice of pancakes, toast or something else. I chose the pancakes. The servings sizes were more that adequate for one person, and it was a tasty, filling brunch after &#34;teaching&#34; finals for the day. The only negative about the whole thing was the potatoes...they were a little burnt and crispy for my taste. That, and did they switch to Pepsi, or did they always have it?

One of my favorites for non-breakfast visits is the chicken, rice and lemon soup. It is so silky and flavorful! It goes with all of their meals very well, with the exception of a breakfast or I would&#39;ve gotten it today.

The seating is typical diner-ish, with booths for four all around the perimeter and about 16 four-person tables (the kind that comfortably seat two) in the center. Never really been crowded, as it looks a lot smaller form the outside, and is a best-kept secret of the Barrington food arena. Although they&#39;re really neat, don&#39;t look too closely at the model planes, or you&#39;ll wonder when the last time a total vacuuming of the place was performed.

The food more than makes up for the decor, and the managers and staff have always been very friendly, yet not overbearing while you&#39;re eating. It&#39;s a great little locally owned restaurant."

While we didn&#39;t actually try the falafel, we did find a large and varied menu to choose from, which is a bit rare in restaurants around here. My wife ordered the eggs Florentine and I just had to try the home made corned beef hash (a weakness of mine). 

The food was okay, but nothing spectacular. My scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly, but the hash and the potatoes were very dry. My wife&#39;s dish was similar in that the eggs were quite good but the potatoes dry, and the hollandaise was not quite right. I will say that the coffee was excellent. 

The food was certainly good enough for us to go back and try again, but they need to hone their craft a bit more when it comes to the breakfast staples. Bad potatoes point to a lazy kitchen, as fried potatoes are easy enough to cook that the kitchen staff must not be paying enough attention to their work. This makes me wonder how good the rest of the food will be.  

The food was certainly good enough to warrant another go, as was the atmosphere of the restaurant. I will update when I try it again."

He is an international business traveler and isn&#39;t around much, but he was on semi-vacation Christmas week.  He suggested we meet at the Canteen.

I kind of enjoyed the atmosphere, especially since I&#39;m am an airplane nut.  The owner (?) was a very jovial guy and greeted me like we were old friends when I came in.

I ordered a cup of coffee and studied the very extensive (typical of Greek owned restaurants) menu and had decided on a &#34;breakfast&#34; entree, by the time my brother arrived.

I had one of their &#34;skillet&#34; dishes.  It was pretty good, but not as good as the similar offering at Papa G&#39;s in Huntley, a favorite breakfast stop on the days that my &#34;Thursday lunch-buddy&#34; and I are Operations dept. volunteers at the Illinois Railway Museum.

Anyway, back to the Canteen.  My brother also had a &#34;breakfast&#34; entree, and said that is what he usually has when he and his family go there.  

The service was excellent.  The only negative, as someone else mentioned was the location of the washrooms, down a narrow stairway to the basement.

I&#39;ll give it another try, and have a different entree sometime soon, and possibly revise the average rating that i gave it."

My son had the chocolate chip pancakes. There were two gigantic pancakes and lots of chocolate chips even though it was a $3.50 kids plate. I had hash, eggs, potatoes, and rye toast for $7. Not bad.

We stopped in for breakfast, and I had the eggs florentine and my husband had corned beef hash.  The corned beef was great...it tasted homemade and had a great corned-beefiness about it, as opposed to the usual catfood-esque stuff served at so many diners.  The eggs florentine was good too, but the texture of the hollandaise seemed a little odd.  The coffee was great.  The fried potatoes that were served with both of our breakfasts were the low point...they were dry and pretty bland.

After reading the reviews on here I feel like maybe the place may deserve a second chance, but I would be extremely hesitant to go back.

I went in yesterday for a late breakfast with my mother while out running errands.  It was about 10 am and there were only 3 other tables in the place.  There were 2 men, who I would assume are managers/owners &amp; there were 2 waitresses.  We were sat by an owner and our waitress came over and timely so got us our drinks &amp; asked us what we wanted to eat.   The food came out in a timely manner, but after that it all went down hill.  We never saw our waitress again till we were done eating &amp; she came to ask if we were done &amp; drop the check.  There is nothing more aggravating then being completely out of water and coffee and NO ONE in the restaurant seems to really care.  When we were done eating she came to pick up our plates and said &#34;are your finished?&#34; and when we both said yes she said &#34;ok&#34;, took our plates, placed the check down &amp; left.  No thank you, no come back again some time, nothing.  Her &amp; the other waitress spent most of their time standing by the open air kitchen eating &amp; playing with their cell phones.

As for the food it was just ok.  I had chocolate chip pancakes which were a little dry due to being kind of over cooked.  My mother had the strawberry french toast &amp; to our surprise it was completely under-cooked.  It was doughy and mushy and not appetizing at all.  You could see the waitress just sprinkle cinnamon &amp; sugar over it when it came to the window when in reality french toast should be cooked with some cinnamon in the mix.

Bartenders are also extremely responsive. Usually get Gina, Brianna or Stephanie.  There&#39;s always good seating - whether at the bar or elsewhere in the restaurant. 

Have tried a variety of foods and cocktails. They have a blueberry margarita that&#39;s out of this world. Never seen it anywhere else. My new favorite drink is the peach smash - very refreshing. Some of the foods we&#39;ve had are fries, boneless wings, spinach artichoke dip. They also make pretty good onion rings.  Really no complaints. Prices are in line with typical bar food and cocktails - definitely less expensive than downtown Chicago."

It&#39;s not a-ok. It&#39;s actually kind of awful, but because the staff is friendly, I&#39;m giving this place two stars. Let&#39;s start with what&#39;s going right: friendly enough staff, gives the people a different sports bar option in a town that doesn&#39;t have too many big chain options, sports on TV&#39;s with a bar. That&#39;s about it. Oh. And maybe ample parking space. 

What&#39;s not going right are the two things that need to be right: service and food. I&#39;ve been here three times as of today, and each time, there&#39;s been something annoying to write about, but I didn&#39;t...until now. The first time, the service was so slow. My dad waited for a beer for 20 minutes, and when he wanted another after he finished his first, he waited another 20 minutes, only to be brought the wrong beer. Like, hello. You literally fill a glass with some liquid that comes out of a tap. Anyone can do it, and it probably wouldn&#39;t take anyone 20 minutes to do it, and yet.... But I digress. They were fairly new, so I figured, &#34;They&#39;re new.&#34; 

A few months later, I went for lunch They have posters hanging around that boasts &#34;lunch in 15 minutes!&#34; (for groups that are 6 or less), and yet we waited 30 minutes...and there were only two of us. So half of our lunch time was wasted just waiting for our food. We didn&#39;t get a chance to enjoy or finish it, so we had to wrap it up to go. Don&#39;t say you can do lunch in 15 minutes because people coming for lunch during the work week don&#39;t have time to waste, and you&#39;re basically wasting our time when you lie to us about such things, B-dubs.

Today, I was like, Ok. Let&#39;s give them another try. So I called ahead of time to make sure my lunch order would be ready by the time I went to pick up so that I could maximize the amount of time I could enjoy it during my break from work. The food was ready when I went to pick up, but I was first kind of annoyed that they haven&#39;t yet figured out a system to have the food near the register when someone orders take out so that the process is faster. Instead, I had to wait for the register kid to walk across the restaurant, into the kitchen, retrieve my food, and then walk back across the restaurant to me to hand me my food. He showed it to me, which I thought was kind of odd, but whatever. I&#39;m like, Yeah. It&#39;s fine. So I ring out and leave. Only to realize when I sat down to eat that there was no dressing. Like, wtf, B-dubs. It&#39;s a salad. How do you not give dressing? That&#39;s not even Cooking 101. That&#39;s Common Sense 101. Granted, the kid showed me the salad, so I take some responsibility for this lapse in attention to detail, but in my defense, I wasn&#39;t REALLY looking because 1. I was thinking about how weird it was that this kid was showing the salad to me like it was some kind of art piece, 2. it&#39;s a salad, so 3. I was thinking that you can&#39;t really mess up a salad. Lesson learned.

I called back saying I didn&#39;t have the dressing, and the person on the phone said he&#39;d give it to me when I came back. So I went back thinking they&#39;d have it ready, but no. Not ready. Someone was in the kitchen getting the dressing, but how was it not already ready? I called beforehand, and it&#39;s dressing. So I&#39;m waiting. And waiting. And waiting. And there&#39;s no one up at the front to welcome anyone except the person cleaning the glass display case, yet I see a huddle of about 4-5 servers near the entrance to the kitchen. All the while, I&#39;m like, Where is my dressing?! WHERE IS IT?! I dunno, people. I&#39;m a pretty flexible person, but when you mess with my food AND take up most of the time I&#39;m allotted to enjoy it, I&#39;m gonna get annoyed. 

I think the most annoying part is that the food wasn&#39;t even all that good. It&#39;s actually pretty bad every time I&#39;ve been here, and the prices are higher than they should be, so it&#39;s just not worth coming back here anymore. If you want that sports bar feel with awesome food and drinks and deals, go across the street to Coach&#39;s. They&#39;ve been around EG forever, and if you go there, you&#39;ll know why. I should&#39;ve gone there today. :(

Sidenote: If you want delicious wings for a reasonable price, go across the street to Jewel. I&#39;m not even kidding. Their wings are DELICIOUS.

As far as B-dubs goes, I&#39;m sorry/not sorry to say DON&#39;T go."

I&#39;m a wing man. I had a particularly favorite server-- her name was Hristy and I felt that she was the waitress who tried the hardest out of all the others to satisfy customers. Shame she left, but I can probably guess why.
As far as I&#39;ve read, the service is atrocious with mostly young teenage girls fawning over the bartender. Hristy was especially attentive to this, and noticed my frustration, as I haven&#39;t even gotten our drinks yet. She apologized profusely and in about .5 seconds Hristy came back with my drink. It&#39;s like she was holding the place together. 
With that being said, she alienated herself from the crowd of teenaged servers and bartenders and waited on me individually, apologizing for the inconvenience. She continued to weight on me, no complications etc. 

BWW isn&#39;t the same without Hristy."

They are consistently never done right. For what you pay the food should be really consistent considering we are always running up a tab with our drinks and we really want food that is good to go with it.

Ive been here before and left a bad review, now im back and they have redeemed themselves!  I decided to give them a try again.  I took into consideration that the first time I went it was lunchtime, in the summer, and they were pretty recently opened.  

I figured that by now they have cycled out the people who were there not because they really wanted to work there, but just to handle the opening influx crowd.  I also figured that mistakes had been made, training was done, and problems were fixed.

Im happy that I did!  

This place is nice.  I love the overall look and feel of it.  I didnt get a chance to take it all in the first time .... it was waaaay to crazy in there plus we sat on the patio.  The bar area is vibrant, the place is loaded with large LED televisions.  

Despite everyone talking it didnt have a loud feel to it!  

My wings came out a bit softer than I originally requested.. nevertheless, in swooped the manager who corrected the situation within 5 minutes.  

I can say that I am happy and I will definitely consider this place moving forward as I venture out on lunch despite previously assigning it the SCARLET LETTER."

There were about ten of us who went together at lunch. This is a fairly new location and I don&#39;t think they have worked out all of the bugs yet. Meals all arrived at different times. They forgot to place the order for three of us. Two orders were wrong.

In fairness, they handled the situation well. The wrong orders were corrected. Those they forgot about were comp&#39;d and they gave them the food to go.

The food we did have was good. I&#39;d like to return once they have a few more months under their belt to give them another try."

They were very busy, so I&#39;m sure this will be a good spot for them in the long run. This location is a little smaller than other Bdubs I have been to, but there are still plenty of TV&#39;s!

My friend and I came here on a Friday night and were seated right away. Our server was nice and took our drink orders right away. However, it took a really long time for the drinks to come to our table. Also, she didn&#39;t have any idea about the different types of beers they had (lack of training is my guess). The food was good overall, normal BWW. I understand they were busy, but it took forever for everything to get to us (drinks, food, check). I was also a little disappointed with the beer selection. They didn&#39;t really have anything unique that I had not tried before.

They had a manager of sorts going around to see if you wanted to try any of the sauces/rubs or beers. You can try 2 beers per person and any of the sauces and rubs. That was a nice service addition. Not sure if they are doing that because they are new, or if all the locations do that now.

But with sometime to kill before one of EGV&#39;s free concerts, I went in for a drink. I had no idea it was only their second day open until the bartender told me. The service was mixed. They had ample staff on hand, but as I was sitting alone at the bar, it took nearly ten minutes to get any service. I ordered a Carribean Brew, which was Dos Equis with some Malibu rum, Sauza gold tequila, coconut flavor, and lime. It was a really enjoyable drink and I actually ordered two.

I did get wings, since they were 65 cents on Tuesday. That decision was against my better judgement. I got eight Chiptle BBQ, which are a dry rub wing. The wings did come out quite fast. Two big issues. One, there was nowhere near enough rub on them. I had to add salt and pepper just to get some decent flavor. Two, they were overcooked and dry. Not acceptable. Lauren, one of the bartenders, was really sweet, checking up on me pretty often. That said, I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to drive back, living 40 minutes away,"

The service was amazing. Rebecca was my server and SHE NEEDS TO STOP SMILING! Lol. She was super friendly. By far the most friendliest waitress I ever had. 
The place was super clean. I give the dude or dudes whoever was in charge of the setup inside the restaurant a big high five. Most Bdubs start from scratch and have the same layout. Since there was already a restaurant before this they had to make with what was there. So they did a great job. Lots of room. This place is also closer to my home then the Schaumburg location even though I live in Schaumburg. Since I am a college head coach I was impressed with the amount of TV&#39;s in there. I love football and there was a BTN football game (rerun) and a CFL game on. I was in heaven baby! I will definitely come back in the future. One thing Schaumburg Bdubs has that Elk Groce does not......it&#39;s the blazing ghost pepper sauce! Please Bdubs bring it to Elk Grove! Best. Sauce. Ever. Also the apple orchard sauce they have for this month is the best I had for a monthly sauce in a very long time. Hey Rebecca......STOP SMILING!!!! lol."

She said she will check and it was another 5 minutes and she come back with our food. We know for certain she forgot to even put in our order. Tacos and nachos should not take 45 minutes to get. She did not even check on us during our meal and did not bring out refills of our drinks. The only time she was attentive is when the check came because she wanted to make sure she got a tip. Low and behold as we were getting ready to leave, she asked if we wanted refills. The only good thing about this visit was the food. There seriously has to be a change by the management here.

Food was delicious (chicken dish) however and at a very reasonable price. 

The ambiance was strange, but not intimidating- more like they didn&#39;t care that the table clothes were all stained and the tables needed a good washing. All in all, it felt dirty and in good need of an update or mop.

I won&#39;t be returning because the food didn&#39;t sit right with me or the person who ate with me. We are the same dish and both experienced an unpleasant side effect a few hours later. I digress.

The only saving grace is the biryani. But that had even gotten worse. The boti toll is ok

I asked if there&#39;s been a change in management or kitchen lately. They denied. I just don&#39;t believe it&#39;s the same uncle in the back anymore. This place was authentic before. Now I see many Mexican in the back attempting to make traditional paki food. Not working.

To make the biryani spicy what they did this time was add red chili powder in huge quantity. When we tasted it we called them immediately and requested for a replacement. While getting the replacement I asked the restaurant guy whether they are going to use the same biryani or prepare another one to which he said that he will not use the same biryani and pack another one. When we reached home and started our dinner to our surprise they had used the same biryani and added some more masala to it. We again called the restaurant to give feedback and also visited the restaurant for third time in the evening and the response from the owner was rude. After spending 2-3 hours and wasting our time and gas to visit the restaurant 3 times the owner wanted us to get another biryani as replacement  ( around 10.30 PM while the first order was placed approximately around 8 PM) to which we did not agree and requested him to cancel the order. The owner was arrogant in his response and said he will not refund the money. I have not seen such an unprofessional approach towards the customer. Try to avoid this restaurant as much as possible.

What arrogance! Clearly they have no respect for customers. I had to force them to give my dish at a reasonable hour. 

I could tell that they were in no mood to give me anything, and this was clearly confirmed when I saw the new dish they gave me. A chicken seekh kebab with no chicken..... And 99% potato. What did you think, that I wouldn&#39;t notice?? Terrible stuff, which I had to throw in the trash. Don&#39;t waste your time going here!!!!

The food was decent, not excellent, but ok. The Palak paneer was a bit watery. We have no idea what the chicken korma tasted like. We never received it. The order was placed through GrubHub, (because when we called the restaurant, they said delivery has to be ordered through GrubHub) and it was definitely on there and paid for. When I called the restaurant, they first said they would give us our korma free. Not that they would refund the korma, they just wouldn&#39;t charge us for it again. Then they hung up on me. When I called back, they said they would make the korma, but we would have to pick it up ourselves. Pick up the order they forgot from our delivery order. I told them we weren&#39;t going to do that, and they said they didn&#39;t know what they could do. Um, how about refund my money? They then said that it was GrubHub that screwed up the order, and they would have to refund the money. That it wasn&#39;t their fault or problem. I mean, they get a written order from GrubHub, and the guy had even acknowledged that the korma was on the order. I made it clear that they would need to make sure the money is refunded, or I will be in there to pay them a visit to get the money refunded in person. Oscar, the manager, seemed very confused as how to handle the situation.

One of my pet peeves is when my order gets screwed up at a restaurant. I understand that mistakes happen, but the management needs to make it right, not shift blame, and refuse to refund my money. It&#39;s a shame, other than the watery palak paneer, the food was fine, the prices were good, and they deliver (although an hour and a half after we ordered). We would have been repeat customers. Instead we&#39;ll be paying more and driving to pick up our order from Taj Mahal in Bloomingdale when we want Indian food."

Hands down , the Frontier dish was the best. Naan was the best we&#39;ve had....thinner so you&#39;re not full from the naan only...the ghosht dish didn&#39;t have as much flavor as I wanted..but it wasn&#39;t bad..just average.  The tea we ordered was amazing ...and served fresh...compared to so many other places we have had chai...they normally give us chai that was made hours ago...this was fresh and only a dollar.  the prices were very good.  i was a bit disappointed with the samosa size...i thought it would be bigger...tasty nonetheless..just would have preferred a larger size or more in quantity.  customer service is what we normally see at any desi restaurant, so can&#39;t say much there.   the decor and place in general is more of a small eat out type of place....but hey...sometimes the tastiest foods are in places like this.  We were so impressed with the taste of the frontier that we are going back again today for dinner. yummy."

I ordered a palak paneer to-go this time. On getting home it turned out to be uncooked saag with no paneer. The owner was also rude saying that the chefs left without finishing the dish and he can&#39;t do anything now. A few times before also the food hasn&#39;t been great either.

For lunch I ordered the Paneer Makhani.  It was spicy and good.  But nothing out of this world.  I also ordered a Mango Lassi. It was a big portion, but not very cold.

The service was not very good.  This place is more of a carry out restaurant.  I felt awkward dining in.  Maybe they would be better for carry out.  The prices are reasonable for the portions."

The restaurant is cramped and not really the cleanest. The seating is much too close together. 
When the food finally came another 30 minutes after placement it was just ok. The chicken pakora was really good, I&#39;ve never had that before. The chicken biryani was lack luster at best, and I got the beef seek kabob and it was gross.

Unfortunately, our local Chinese restaurants were closed but luckily for us, there were plenty of Indian restaurants to choose from. I decided on BBQ Tonight since it&#39;s new and their website quotes having received awards for their biryani and Pakistanian dishes. 

Initially, we ordered three dishes but the waiter said that it was too much food because their large portions. We decided on the lamb biryani and the chicken makhani. He was right since the biryani could have fed four people. Flavor wise, a little disappointing since both dishes lacked spice and heat. I have yet to find a place that can beat my favorite Indian restaurant&#39;s biryani (see my profile for details). 

There was also someone in the kitchen singing who sounded like Cookie Monster. Overall, not bad for the price point and the fact that they were open on Christmas Eve. I&#39;ll have to come back and try their grilled dishes. Maybe we can hear an encore  of Cookie Monster."

My first thoughts on entering was &#34;hole in the wall&#34; but holes in the wall sometimes have good food. 

The waiter recommended  Chicken Biryani so we both ordered that.

The spices in the dish were not working for me, and I do enjoy most Indian food. It was a huge pile of rice with spices and chucks of bad chicken that was mostly fat and bone.

I was especially disappointed because I&#39;d read the positive yelp reviews and thought this might be a little gem.  There are a lot of really good Indian restaurants in the area, this one is not one of them."

I drive about 20 miles one way to get food. Its just awesome. The quantity is so much that even 2 person cannot finish the biryani. 

I have eaten almost all chicken dishes in their menu and never found even a single problem with any of the things. I would highly recommend to try this place. For starters, their chicken pakora are the best.  Try the chicken biryani for sure.

Prices are the best. Just 7 bucks for a chicken biryani.  Decor is not that great but you can still have food there.  I guess taste of the food beats everything."

Good food... being vegetarian, was limited to the Naan and Biryani (very good jasmine rice and vegetable mix) and a couple other things... super inexpensive as well, we ate family style - sharing multiple entrees and desserts.

The Kabab rolls were pretty authentic as they were wrapped in the Paratha but .. lack authentic Flavor. We were told that they have best Niharee in Town ... possibly better than Sabri. Boy was that a big LIE. Someone just dropped an entire box of Red Chilli in the dish (Read Part-2). 

(Part -2 ) 10/08/2012 : Me being from Lahore I thought there is something about the food that I liked and so I decided to go back on my my way home. Ordered Niharee again and yes this time it was amazing. Served with good Khameeri Roti ( which they are calling Naan) this time the Niharee was almost like the Chef changed. Also ordered Goat Biryani ... Rice was not done ( seriously how hard is to boil rice). Second visit they successfully managed to mess up Chicken Paratha Roll. Also we tried Kheer was not cooked enough to get the creamy texture.

Service is really bad. Bathrooms can be really clean.

And further, BBQ Tonight&#39;s vegetable biryani is equal to or better than that of the others. 

Obviously, from other reviews, I was prepared that the name didn&#39;t quite fit the place. But because my experience was pretty decent I am more than happy to cut them some slack. Plus, thankfully, they weren&#39;t closed between 3 pm and 5 pm.  Why don&#39;t all of the other nearby Indian restaurants cut me some slack in this regards.

The are on the right side of this strip mall and there are other cuisines such as falafel and Chinese if you have friends that want that.

While we were there, another customer was complaining that he ordered food for pick-up and it was not ready an hour later.

However, no apology as he took the piece of wire and just simply walked away.   I ended up paying for that steel wool biriyani by the way.  the service and staff suck and could give a crap about you.  The water they serve you is warm and if you are spiced up, good luck getting a refill.  I went ahead and grabbed a pitcher for my table instead of waiting for my stinky breath waiter to realize that we were in need of H2O.   As I went to use the restroom, i walked past the kitchen and the door was open so I was able to glance in.  I wished I hadn&#39;t.  Didn&#39;t look very appetizing to say the least.  The bathrooms had no way of drying your hands so toilet paper saved the day.  Kinda rough but I managed. I also ordered the mixed grill platter which was outstanding. The naan was good. The chicken pakora that I ordered were not cooked all the way and the breading was still moist.  They won&#39;t see me here again ... I can guarantee you that."

In my humble opinion, this is the best place in the entire Chicagoland area for non-vegetarian Indian/Pakistani food.

Both the Nihari and the Karahi Gosht are the best I have had with the Gosht (Goat) being my favorite.  I will make the trek to Hoffman Estates from the city just to eat here.

The menu can be kind of daunting since most of us probably haven&#39;t heard of any of the stuff and there are no descriptions. I always get the Chicken Boti which is spectacular!! It is kind of spicy though. It is basically chunks of seasoned chicken that you wrap in nans (which are huge pieces of pita like bread) and then dip in this yogurt based sauce that is to die for! And one of them is huge and definitely splittable. The Veggie Biryani is also very good. It is rice mixed with veggies and bits of potato. It is EXTREMELY spicy though. You really can&#39;t eat more than a few bites at a time.  (At least I can&#39;t and I have a pretty high tolerance of spice.) So, yeah I would definitely recommend getting take-out from this place.

When we asked the manager about the up charge she had no answer. 

Who in the world charges extra for ice in a drink that comes standard with ice? While $7 is a price we would have paid the fact that it was not the price and the up charge for ICE what just ridiculous.

You may be ok with hidden ridiculous charges but it does not sit well with me. Just charge $7 not nickel and dime your customers. Do be surprised as you lose market share close locations and be on the verge of going out of business. It is unfortunate. I was looking forward to trying their food."

I was relatively correct. 

First of all, the wine list is not good. They had one house wine (everything else was way overpriced). Fun fact, if you get the house wine you don&#39;t get a real wine glass. You get a water glass. Classy. They do, however, leave the bottle at your table and let you fill up your own glass and keep track yourself. Seems crazy to me, but whatever.

The food sounds a lot better on the menu than it tastes. I got the Penne Rustica. That actually wasn&#39;t too bad, but I tried my friend&#39;s pasta and it basically had no flavor. The bread was delicious, but they don&#39;t have parmesan cheese on the table for you to make an olive oil dip with. You have to keep asking them for cheese. Other places I have been to just have a bowl of cheese for you to use at your discretion.

The service was fine at first, but for not being very busy, we hardly saw our waitress towards the end. She never filled up our waters, and for a while we thought she forgot about us. It took forever to get our check.

Honestly I would rather go to Olive Garden or Biaggi&#39;s over this place any day."

Great service and excellent bread. Although this time I was stuffed from eating a large lunch at a other restaurant and I ate tiramisu and coffee while my wife enjoyed her birthday dinner. They have a large selection of italian dishes that I personally believe are well done. It may not be as amazing as custom made pasta, but it is cooked al dente and the bread is simply amazing with olive oil. Our server was nice and didn&#39;t care that I had dessert as my dinner. 

Pro: friendly, good italian food, free bread

Cons: lots of carbs in all the dishes, not light salads that have fruit

The Chianti BBQ Steak comes with a side of mac and cheese and you can order it by asking your waiter. Surprisingly, the mac and cheese ended up being the best thing I ate out of the dishes that we tried. It came with pancetta, green peas, and bread crumbs. It was exactly what I wanted in a cheesy mac and cheese and more. The only problem was that there wasn&#39;t more of it. I realize that Macaroni Grill is trying to be more like a trendy Olive Garden but this dish should really be a full entrée since it was that good. 

For a place that&#39;s trying to be in between Olive Garden and Maggiano&#39;s, I would rather go to either one of these places than eat again at Macaroni Grill. My spaghetti was over cooked and the sauce was watery. I&#39;ve had spaghetti and meatballs that were better at diners. I asked for parmesan cheese a couple of times and our waiter was being stingy. Surprisingly, Macaroni Grill ended up costing just as much as Maggiano&#39;s. Next time, I would rather just eat at Maggiano&#39;s where the portions are larger and the food is much better.

Over the years the menu has changed (which is ok) but so has the quality of food and service. 

We went for an early dinner since we have a baby who eats fairly early. There were a few people there already, which meant it was going to start getting busy. We asked to be seated away from people as my child likes to get out of highchair from time to time. Our request was denied. That&#39;s alright, I understand they&#39;d like to keep sections closed until more people come in. 

This is where the problems start to occur. 
The waiter lacked personality, common sense, and the desire to perform ones job at a mediocre level. 

He took our drink orders but forgot to bring half of the drinks (there were only three of us at dinner). I ordered iced tea....he forgot the sugar, even after asking for it twice. 
He brought out the bread after placing our dinner order. But no oil, cheese, etc. the manager actually walked over and performed this guy&#39;s job. 
Eventually, when he did make his way back to our table we had to ask for the cheese...again. When he brought it over he was grating the cheese about three feet above the plate instead of bending down to the plate so that cheese would not end up everywhere. 

Our food arrived, it was not only plain looking (on effort on display) it just tasted ok. I had the penne rustica. Nothing special. Mom had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken (sans chicken). There were 2.5 thinly sliced pieces of chicken in the ENTIRE dish. We called the manager over because I wanted to know exactly how they can charge $3 extra for such little chicken. Plus, mom really wanted chicken. The manager, Cindy, says &#34;well a
Ma&#39;am it&#39;s supposed to be 4 oz. are you sure there isn&#39;t anymore in there?&#34; What I wanted to say was &#34;that&#39;s what you should ask your chef&#34; but instead my mom showed her that obviously there was nothing else.  

Long story short, the meals sucked. Cindy did comp the Alfredo meal but her attitude wasn&#39;t the best. The waiter, Luis, needs more training on the lunch shift before being promoted to the dinner shift. 

Overall, this place has declined in every aspect. My best friend and I used to come here a lot but have since abandoned the thought....now I remember why. 

Save yourself the trip and headache.  Go anywhere else but here."

It&#39;s one of those places that I always enjoy but never think of when we&#39;re having the &#39;WhereDoYaWannaGoForDinner&#39; conversation. I know it&#39;s a chain, but for consistency, it&#39;s a great choice.  Lucky for me, we were in the area a few weeks ago and decided to stop in for a late lunch. 

The menu is fresh and fun!  There were quite a few summer specials available and the new tapas options seemed like a good deal. Here&#39;s my problem at Macaroni Grill...I can never decide what I want to order. I&#39;ve liked everything that I&#39;ve ever had here.  We decided against an appetizer to share because MG gives you fresh baked rosemary Italian bread to nosh on while you chat before your meal. Even my hubby, who is not a bread guy, enjoys this little perk. Eat it all?  No worries. They&#39;ll bring you more ASAP. 

So he orders the chicken Parmesan and I go outside the box. I decide to forgo an actual entree and instead eat two tapas appetizers that he would never eat: Lobster stuffed clams and artichoke potato cakes. They have really changed things up because his chicken is not drowning in sauce or cheese. It actually needs more sauce for dipping (which a passerby server was kind enough to get for us). He ate 2/3 of the meal and brought the rest home for our son. I indulged and ate all of the clams because they don&#39;t reheat well. They were low in calories and pretty tasty with bits of lobster, clam, prosciutto, onions, peppers and breadcrumbs rounding out the dish. I ate just a bite of the fried artichoke potato cakes. They were good, but I knew they would reheat beautifully in the oven for a later date. 

Overall, it&#39;s a pretty good restaurant with plenty of options. The servers are friendly. They occasionally will email a coupon which I should really start printing out. Actually, a couple visits ago, our server redeemed a coupon by looking at my email on my phone. They really are accommodating. Try to forget that it&#39;s a chain and maybe, just maybe, you will give them four stars too."

I didn&#39;t care for this place. The service was good but the food was as if it was made by Pizza Hut or something. The clam chowder was bland and the bread they served looked good but it tasted as though it was Wonder Bread.

I had the chicken parma salad which was good but it was just a salad. My wife&#39;s chick mushroom cannelloni plate was bland, It just didn&#39;t have &#34;The Taste&#34; 

Not a bad place to go to but I&#39;d rather dine else where.

I&#39;ve been here twice, once a few years ago, and most recently, this past weekend.  I wasn&#39;t to impressed the first time; and even less impressed the second.

The restaurant&#39;s feel is pretty authentic; but hardly original.  It comes across as your typical &#39;chain&#39; Italian restaurant trying to pull in elements to inspire the feeling of Italy.  The seating is a bit awkward as it&#39;s mostly open with a few booth seats around the perimeter of the large, banquet style room.  It&#39;s most likely designed this way to accommodate larger families.

The wait staff was boring; no one was &#39;excited&#39; to see us, nor made us feel welcome when we walked into their establishment; and everyone we saw was sluggishly walking about as if waking from a long night of restless sleep.  Not one employee looked thrilled to be apart of the experience, and the lack of smiling made that apparent.

The food is sub-par at best.  I admit, I can, at times, be a bit picky; but there was something about my dish I just didn&#39;t like.  Taste or perhaps the texture; I&#39;m uncertain.  My friend ordered a large noodle dish, which, when tasted, was discovered to be under cooked.  My friend; who is a bit of a foodie, and was once a restaurant auditor stated the noodles, which looked freshly made, were cooked without first being separated, which let them clump up and left parts of them raw.  We exchanged the dish, but we are unsure the server understood our &#39;complaint&#39;.

My friend really wanted the dish he had originally ordered, only done correctly.  Instead he was asked to pick a new dish, wish he did; leaving the rest of the dining party awkwardly picking at our food until his arrived as to not &#39;leave him behind&#39; in the dining experience.

At the end of our meal we tried to use coupons; unfortunately, to our surprise, they were expired.  The manager was kind enough to take out 9$ appetizers off as a way to appease the awkward discovery.  Unfortunately, she didn&#39;t ask us how our food was, nor did she apologize for my friend&#39;s food being under prepared.  She seemed uninterested in our service, or our comfort; and again... there was NO smiling!

Will I come here again?  Eh; If I want Italian food; I&#39;ll head to my friends place; at least there we&#39;re encouraged to laugh and enjoy our experience."

I dare to say this is a step up (albeit a small step) from Olive Garden, but with higher prices, and no soup/salad included with the meal!

A group of six girls met here one evening at five.  There was no wait.  Heck, there was really nobody in the restaurant when we got there.  Maybe one other table.  It had filled in immensely by the time we were done, however, but there were still plenty of open tables.

Apparently, Thursday is 1/2 price wine off of bottles, so one of my friends ordered one, but the rest of us stuck with soft drinks.  

The complimentary bread was fantastic, but I prefer mind with bread instead of the oil/pepper combo.  To be honest, if parmesan cheese isn&#39;t involved w/ the oil, there&#39;s really no point

Onto the meal--my sister and I split the trio and she ordered a bowl of soup.  I didn&#39;t have any of the soup, but the trio was good.  Well, parts of the trio were good.  The caneloni was good, the chicken parm was good, and the lasagna was....not good.  I don&#39;t know what it was, it just didn&#39;t have a good taste to it at all.  I was not impressed.

And you know it&#39;s bad when your hungry, pregnant sister won&#39;t touch it...  Just sayin&#39;!

Our waitress was Stephanie, and she was delightful and attentive.  I definitely loved having her as a server.  She was attentive without being overbearing.  She knew we were trying to get to a movie on time, so when we asked her to wrap things up for us/get us our checks, she jumped right on it!  She would get five stars by herself!

I would go back again, but it&#39;s not a restaurant I would go seeking out!  Like another reviewer pointed out, I just don&#39;t THINK about it when the hunger pangs strike!"

Food is always great, and the servers are too. Their house chianti is fantastic, and I love their &#39;honor system&#39; where they leave the bottle on your table and you make marks per glass poured.

They recently overhauled their entire menu and unfortunately took out some of our favorites, but it&#39;s still delicious. The artichoke hearts appetizer was phenomenal, and my Pollo Caprese was simple but great - exactly what I had a taste for.

The Eggplant Parmesan left a bit to be desired, and we were stunned that they didn&#39;t have black olives or anchovies for pizzas. Our only other complaint was that the marinara sauce came in a dish the size of your thumbnail (not kidding). Dip one calamari ring, and you&#39;re out."

$9 for a roasted veggie flatbread pizza that&#39;s enough for 2 sittings or for 2 to share is a great value!  The only downside was that I thought the zucchinis didn&#39;t really belong, but I enjoyed the roasted peppers, onions, and basil.  The lemon chicken entree had actual lemon rinds distributed throughout the pasta, which was unexpected (mmm, more fiber for the body).

There was a minimal wait at 7:30ish on a Friday night.  Not great, but an a-ok stop."

We had never been to this restaurant before, so we decided to give it a whirl.

Upon entering, we noticed the comfortable atmosphere, filled with yummy smells and a unique set up with service stations located in the middle aisle (this was fun to look at, as it was designed in an eye-appealing manner).  We were seated in a comfortable booth and promptly offered our drinks.  

The first dish we ordered included the mac and cheese bites with truffle sauce (DELICIOUS).  We only ordered 5 but I am pretty sure that we could have eaten 100 of these.  The second course, our main meal, did not thrill our taste buds in the same manner.  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan, while my husband ordered the Primo Pepperoni Flatbread.  The food was hot and ready to eat, but eat most of it, we did not.  The chicken parmesan seemed to need additional spices to flavor it up, as it was rather bland and somewhat mushy (Unfortunately, I have no idea how else to describe it).  The flatbread was partially burnt, in that about 40% of it was black on the crust and did not have much flavor either.  

It was an unfortunate occurrence, since the appetizer was so good!  However, even though we did not enjoy our particular dishes, the service was excellent (Sean) and the atmosphere was very inviting.  If we do go back, it will be for something other than the items we originally ordered (except for the bites!), but we are unsure as to whether or not we will revisit this particular restaurant."

The prices have gone up and portions gone down. At least their balsamic vinegar was high quality which was great with the bread.

The house Chianti had a run of the mill flavor, lacking complexity or personality.

The eggplant Parmesan was the best plate on the table though their marinara had a chunky tomato texture that my hubby pushed aside."

If you are looking at the menu online, BE SURE TO first select which location you want, not simply the choice of &#34;menu.&#34; THEN you will see a full menu and prices. If you don&#39;t know the zip code, there is a way to select the city and state. We went to the Hoffman Estates location.

For dessert, the chocolate cake, and I love chocolate, is so decadent, I just wish they served it with ice cream.

However, there are those rare occasions when I crave the Mushroom Ravioli from Romano&#39;s Macaroni Grill. Do you know of any other place that serves ravioli filled with something other than cheese? 

I enjoy their warm Rosemary Bread with EVOO and parmesean dipping sauce. Their Stuffed Mushroom appetizer is a great starter dish; but lately, we have been ordering the Caeser Salad and Fresh Greens Salad to help with our digestion.  Each side salad is an additional $3.oo with an entree.

I found my favorite entree, the fresh ravioli stuffed with porcini mushrooms, caramelized onions and marsala cream sauce for $13.00, so I&#39;ll order the same thing each time we visit. 

Jason is more adventurous and will try a new dish. This happens about every 3 weeks. This past Friday (Dec. 9), he tried the Shrimp Portofino. For $15.00, he ate jumbo shrimp, capellini pasta, spinach, mushrooms with pine nuts and lemon butter sauce.

We don&#39;t normally go to restaurants late on the weekends because we know how busy they get. So when we had to wait between the salad and entrees during our most recent visit, we didn&#39;t mind. There are crayons and a paper table cover to help keep us preoccupied. I also find myself always seated facing the open kitchen. I  enjoy watching the prep work and commotion that goes on there.

While the meatballs were acceptable, the sauce was so bland that they couldn&#39;t make up the difference.

Making this experience even more disappointing was the fact that the dish was just shy of $13.  IMO, a bit pricey for a very run of the mill bowl of pasta with no soup or salad included.

Based on cost, and the fact that the gravy is such a key ingredient for so many Italian dishes, I would have a hard time recommending the Macaroni Grill."

The server brought out the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken on it, which I didn&#39;t order. I mentioned this to her, but did not request a new dish. I figured she wouldn&#39;t charge us for it since I didn&#39;t order it but it was on our bill, which I was not happy with. Also, the server got the grated Parmesan on my mother which was a little irritating. The Alfredo was very bland as well , I wouldn&#39;t order it again. The pasta Milano was our best dish i&#39;d say. Overall, I love this restaurant but this experience was a bit of a bummer."

Since escaping my mid-suburbia roots to college and beyond, I&#39;ve widen my range on &#34;Italian food&#34; a bit. While no expert, I can say that Macaroni Grill is a decent place for pasta. I rate their dishes on a more general level, because it&#39;s a good restaurant for Americanized Italian.

The service is attentive (the kind that writes their names in crayon on the paper tablecloth), the quality is good, and ambiance is welcoming for groups and families. Because the prices are within an affordable range, Macaroni Grill is a great options for any day of the week and any occasion.

With your meal, you&#39;ll get fresh rosemary bread with olive oil and Parmesan, which is a sure crowd-pleaser. Their wine and drink selection is wide though not overly expensive, and they have a the option to create your own pasta as well.

A few of my favorites here are Carmela&#39;s Chicken (think of Maggiano&#39;s Rigatoni D) and Pasta Milano. Their selection of pizzas and appetizers are a sure thing as well.

If you have a taste for truly authentic Italian, this may not be for you. But if you want a good meal of pasta or pizza and you&#39;re looking for a bit more artisan tastes, Macaroni Grill is promising."

The menu is simple and they are decently priced. 
My fiance and I LOVE the Rosemary Bread you get in the beginning, though the past two times we have been there we have had to wait a long time to get it :( However, food is always done promptly and everything is so tasty. I&#39;ve had the Pollo Caprese, Eggplant Parmesan, and a seasonal dish they serve in the winter, can&#39;t remember the name. All were seasoned perfectly and you get very nice portions. 
Also, the honor program with their house wine is AWESOME!! Basically they leave a huge bottle of their house wine (either Chianti or Chardonnay) and you pour the glasses yourself. At the end of the meal you tell them how many you&#39;ve had and its put on your bill. Its nice if you don&#39;t want to buy a whole bottle and want your wine fast!"

She wanted appetizers in the worst way. Their online menu revealed Italian Tapas which made going to Macaroni Grill a done deal.

Yelp describes the restaurant as Casual/Romantic. There were dim lights and nice wood decorations. Yet, I was wearing a t-shirt and hoodie but didn&#39;t feel that out of place.

We were seated promptly but the service once we were seated was a little slow. When we first got there the restaurant wasn&#39;t that busy so we were a bit confused about the delay. The waitress did greet us and asked us if we had been there before. We hadn&#39;t and she said &#34;Welcome to Macaroni Grill. Let me know if you have any questions about the menu&#34;. Typically if people are new to restaurants the waitress would give a brief tour of the menu and recommend a few things. Not in this case. Just a bit weird.

Appetizer consisted of meatballs and macaroni and cheese bites with their &#34;2 for $9&#34; deal. Both were good with the meatballs having the edge. We polished off both without much of a problem at all. For the main course I had a Spicy Italian Spinach Pizza and my girlfriend had a pasta with white sauce. Both weren&#39;t bad but nothing great. I&#39;d have liked the pizza with a bit more flavor and a crispy crust. The crust was very soft and limp but I did enjoy the sweeter taste.

Next time we go we&#39;ll probably try something different off the menu. And at the very least, even if we don&#39;t like the main courses, we know we&#39;ll be happy with the Tapas."

Anytme the server stopped by she seemed like she was in a hurry.  Or had something else to do other than wait tables.  Given the limited number of occupied tables, I couldn&#39;t understand the lack of service.  She wasn&#39;t our original server so maybe she was asked to cover for someone else.

Located right on Rt.72 and Barrington, this place is convientely located by people coming straight from work or home. Every time I come here I always seem to lean towards the penne rustica or the shrimp portofino, both of these dishes are freshly prepared and delicious.
The pricing is decent and for 4 people it could be at $70-80 dollars for dinner.
Environment is clean and I noticed that when you visit the restroom and hear the music its actually a cd on how to learn Italian, how neat!

Our recent visit was extremely disappointing.  We called ahead to make a reservation because we assumed there would be a croud on Sunday afternoon.  Arrived at approximately 12:45  to find the parking lot nearly empty (not a good omen).  Walked inside and saw that there may have been one other group inside and the staff was grouped up apparently shooting the breeze. Obviously we were seated right away.  I quickly notice that our booth was not clean (visible crumbs) on seats and table!  Why would the staff be standing around with obvious work to be done?  Menus and tablecloth were stained (Recall that noone else is here. Couldn&#39;t they find one clean menu?)!  Ordered the special filet with asparagus and lobster mashed potatoes.  Steak was ok but asparagus was stringy and bland and potatoes were lumpy and uninspired.  Ordered pepperoni pizza and chicken strips from the kids menu for our two children.  Pizza - no pepperoni.  Waitress said she thought we ordered plain pizza.  Good grief, had one order to get right - FAIL.  Chicken - tasteless.  Wife got seafood pasta - flavorless.

Came in on a Thursday around 6:30 and there was less than 20 people there. I got nervous... maybe there is a reason no one goes here for dinner. We sat in a booth that looked to be 20 years old in some greasy spoon diner. The seats were torn up and now I&#39;m really getting nervous. Maybe they don&#39;t care to fix and maybe they don&#39;t care about the food.  The waiter poured some wine, brought the bread and then poured the bottle of RED WINE instead of olive oil onto a plate.. seriously.. red wine puddled all over the plate and table! The waiter&#39;s reaction.. &#34;oops&#34;.  Before the wine got onto her clothes, my daughter grabbed a napkin to stop it. He placed it on the puddle and walked away. OK.. so we were hungry and ordered a meatball app which was great, laughed off the wine incident and soon left. The waiter never asked if the wine stained the clothes or if we wanted to move tables.

To be honest, I think a few of their dishes are a little on the bland side. But they&#39;re still decent, I mean, we do go here every once in a while (my husband is a bit more enthusiastic about it than I am). I wasn&#39;t thrilled to see that they did away with one of the dishes that I really liked, but restaurants do that from time to time.

We have been there a few times and always have been pleased. OK..so as we enter the door we hear the nice Italian music playing. We go in ask for a booth and the hostess wants to sit us closest to the bar and the front door. It is 22 degrees out, the place is empty so we requested to sit in the actual dining room in a booth where it was warm. Hostess looked confused over this request and needed to ask permission to sit us where we wanted to. Did I mention it was empty?

I ordered chicken scalloppini and husband ordered chicken marsala. Only after meal came did we realize that there were daily specials..waiter never mentioned them to us. OK now the music...we had to talk over the music and somehow it switched from Italian to more of an ecletic style totally out of sinc with the atmosphere. Menu totally changed as well. Instead of a regular menu we were handed the new style menu on heavy duty cardboard. Even with reading glasses it was not easy to read. Cannot imagine how difficult it would be to read it at dinner time when they turn the lights down.

Now the food...husband liked his marsala. My chicken came with artichoke, etc. Did someone not tell the cook that artichokes are not served with the thistle as it is not edible. So much of this on the plate that it was obvious someone thought it was an ok thing to serve. Mentioned this to waiter and he brought me a small dish of artichokes. Still icky and I didn&#39;t eat it. 

Chicken was tasty so all was not a waste. Seems like they are copping out with the cheap menu and ridiculous choice of music for an Italian restaurant.

It will be awhile before we try it again."

I am beginning to think it&#39;s their &#34;new&#34; way unfortunately based on other people&#39;s reviews.
1. Nobody came to our table for about 8-9 minutes.  I had to get up and ask another server to locate our server.
2. When our server finally came to greet us, she REEKED of cigarette smoke.  Cleary, she was on a smoke break and not watching her section even though we were there at 6:30 PM.  Her name was Kendra.
3. She did not take a drink order and I had to interrupt her during my meal to get a drink.  We had water on the table brought by the other server who hunted her down in the first place.
4.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, only for her to return and tell us they were all out.  How can you be all out of one of your 6 appetizers at 6:30 PM on a Friday night?  The weekend is just beginning.
5. We ordered the calamari instead.  The breading tasted good, but the calamari was over cooked and greasy.  The tomato dip with it was not appetizing at all.  But that could just be personal preference.
6. The oil on the table was empty and we took one from the empty table next to us, only to find that one empty too.
7. Our food came and mine was SUPER disappointing.  I order the Pasta Milano almost every time I go and this was so bad.  It was PACKED with garlic.  I LOVE garlic and put quite a bit more of it in my food than the average bear.  This was overwhelmingly garlicky and hard to eat.  It lacked solid flavor and was undersalted.  The shrimp that I requested for an upcharge was abundant but so overcooked it was hard to chew.  
8.  Kendra brought us a dessert to make up for her smoking ass.  It was the chocolate cake. The cake was awful.  Dry, under sugared and not appetizing at all!
9.  Unrelated to our personal experience, the waiter serving the table next to us had an unbuttoned button on his shirt and his hairy, doughy belly button was poking out for allll to see!  Gross! :)

Is it possible that all of this was just a series of unusual flukes of the night - YES!  I will go back and give it another shot, but my confidence is not too high!"

I am not a fan of chain restaurants, so it was difficult for me, when sitting down to write this review, to rate them 4 stars.  Because for god&#39;s sake, it&#39;s a chain restaurant!  4 stars should be reserved for the indie places, for the fine dining establishments - it&#39;s against my nature to rate a chain 4 stars.  But I realized that I must evaluate this on comparison to other chains.  Thus the 4 star rating.

It really did exceed my expectations!  My parents come here often and wanted to go here for a Sunday dinner.  And it was pretty decent.  I had a seared scallop salad, which was pretty good, but a little heavy on the dressing.  Tried some of the Pasta Carmella, and it was tasty.  Bread was garlicky and yummy.  So it&#39;s really not a bad place for an Italian meal - just realize that it is a chain.  Good for lunches."

Repeating what others have noted, it seemed understaffed, as the waiter seemed overworked, and the service was erratic.  We ordered from the &#34;New Spring Menu&#34; (in July?) and both items were good or better.  I had the Chicken Julia and my wife had the Clam and Sweet Corn Fettuccine.  Both are about $15 a-la-carte.  I added a Ceasar Salad, which was very ordinary and not worth the $3 extra. They start with a really good warm loaf of Focaccia bread and Olive Oil for dipping.  No grated cheese on the table though and they never ask if you want additional bread.  As noted by some, this seems like a bit more upscale place than Olive Garden, and the menu variety and pricing seems to confirm that.  If service was better due to proper staffing, and/or having busboys, it would be a better place.  As it is, it isn&#39;t worth a very long drive."

Went there last night, it was OK but I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on over there.

We had a three year old and a baby with us, but despite many open (perhaps they were reserved?) tables in the restaurant we were seated in the back area next to an older couple who were probably trying to have a nice quiet dinner; instead, they were sandwiched between us and another big family with kids.   We did our best to be unintrusive but those tables are kinda close together back there.  

Our waiter was very friendly and I could tell he was trying to do his best, but some things were just a little off.  Our bread took forever to come out of the oven.  We ordered roasted vegetables as an appetizer, which have always been a favorite, but they came out a little dry and needed a little oil and salt before they were very good- something I never had to do before.  There are probably those who complain about the presence of oil on a plate - perhaps they are making it &#34;low-fat&#34; to appease those idiots?  I dunno.

I ordered the Crusted Sole, which is more or less Sole Meuniere with capers, and it was pretty good.  My three year old liked it too.  I was pleasantly surprised that the orzo side on my plate was more vegetable than pasta.   My husband ordered the Portafino - shrimp and spinach on pasta - also his pasta portion was not too big at all.  Some people may complain about the small pasta portions - if you want a carb fest, go to Olive Garden.  Personally, the last thing i want on a $15 plate is a huge pile of pasta...

Overall a good place, I just hope they can come out of some little &#34;bumps&#34; I perceived there last night."

As far as service, it&#39;s hit or miss here. One time my shrimp was not fully cooked - half of it was pink but the other half was bluish. On top of that it took a while for my server to come check on me to find out if the food was okay, so I sat there with my uncooked shrimp for a good 5 or ten minutes. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I really appreciated. There is one server in particular that was great, and I hate that I cannot remember his name at the moment, but we do try to request him when we see that he is there."

We had a fairly large group, with a baby and the staff could not be more accommodating with us.  We were seated in a low traffic area (perfect for babies in carriers) and the service was fantastic.

I&#39;m always concerned with large group service, or lack thereof, but our server was great.  She always had refills before we had to ask and our orders came out perfect.

I had the shrimp with spinach and mushrooms in a cream sauce.  It was fantastic.  FRESH, crisp spinach.    One friend ordered the lobster ravioli and it looked and smelled fantastic.

We went for lunch on a Saturday, so the place wasn&#39;t super busy.  I was really happy with our meals and the Macaroni Grill."

The food was a-okay, I chose a dish with alot of tomatoe sauce and tomotoes not a big fan of tomatoes..so I wasn&#39;t too thrilled but that&#39;s my fault.

It&#39;s definitely better than other Italian chains I&#39;ve been to in the past like Carrabba&#39;s, Olive Garden &amp; Maggiano&#39;s. The server was very attentive, even a little on the smothering side, and the food was good too. I had the veal marsala &amp; also tried the penna alla vodka. I&#39;d definitely get the penne or something similar to it if I went back. It was much better than my veal. I liked that they bring you a huge bottle of chianti to drink from on the &#39;honor system&#39; and that it&#39;s tasty though dirt cheap!

Taste what I&#39;d expect buying from a cafeteria or something similar. At least you could draw on the table.

No one I was with really liked it either (big group actually). This doesn&#39;t affect my review cause I&#39;m not petty like that, but I remember the hostess muttering &#39;sure, take all of them&#39; when I took a couple toothpicks from the front area.

Didn&#39;t know they have a brick oven? I&#39;m a sucker for those, but don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth it to try it (still have to know how to make the pizza), is it any good?"

I mean, I still go any and everywhere to eat, as long as the food is good, so I&#39;m not picky. Per say. Whatever.

I came here with my Mom and Niece. My Niece suggested it since she works at another Darden Restaurant - Seasons 52 (yum), and said we could enjoy eating while getting a small discount.

We arrive about an hour before they close. Took a few for a waiter to come to our table. When he finally did, we were pretty much ready to go ahead and order. I opted for the crusted chicken parmesean. It&#39;s normally amazing when I have it somewhere like at Coopers Hawk, so I figure ya couldn&#39;t go wrong with it. Salads came first. They tasted like someone went outside and picked grass and put it in bowls with dressing. The bread that came with the table was supposed to be fresh, but it took muscle to get through it. It was dry. And made a big ol mess. When the meal came, it was quite salty. But edible. I guess. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Nor was my blood pressure."

She&#39;d never been to Longhorn before and is a big fan of steak, so the three of us decided to give it a try. 

We arrived around 5pm and were seated immediately-right next to the kitchen. Not a huge deal but definitely not the best spot in the house either. Our server, Adam, came over right away to take our drink orders. He also gave us a few recommendations. We all ordered margaritas and they were pleasantly tasty. We also ordered the Texas T&#39;Onion appetizer as I had a free coupon for signing up for the email club. Shortly after the appetizer arrived (good), we ordered our meals, which all came with a salad.

Salads were a bit disappointing. The Caesar lacked dressing and the house salad looked like it was made up of all of the leftover bits of the lettuce head. The ranch dressing was good though. 

All three of us enjoyed our meals. I ordered the four cheese pasta (I know, I know, this is a steak place) and it was a bit lukewarm, but otherwise tasted just fine. My friend really enjoyed her rib-eye and my other friend liked the parmesan chicken. 

Overall, the server really took this place from 3 to 4 stars. Adam was attentive without being pushy, and made sure everything was right with our meal. 

Would I come here again? Probably not, but only because I prefer Outback if I&#39;m really in the mood for a decent chain restaurant meal."

My first thought was -- homey, quaint, and a little more &#34;calm&#34; than some of other steakhouse style chains.

The food was pretty good - but I have to say the garlic parmesan fries were nothing to brag about and not worth the 99-cent upcharge.

It also took FOREVER for our food to come out (we were a table of 6, but we dined at an off time and the restaurant was not that busy). Our waitress kept our drinks filled and since we really weren&#39;t in any rush, it wasn&#39;t a huge deal to wait on our food.

Having only a perception of LongHorn, my first thought was that it must be similar to Outback, being a notch above...so I didn&#39;t expect anything near a Capital Grille or Morton&#39;s Steakhouse experience as I&#39;ve had in the past...but walking in, I must admit the interior was nicely decorated and ambiance was warm..definitely more inviting &amp; upscale than an &#34;Outback&#34;..

There were 9 in our group - and while they DO NOT take reservations (as I heard they do not have a system set up for this, even for large parties) IF you call about an hour prior to arriving and leave your name, they will accommodate you....and they did.

I arrived w/a friend a little early, so we sat in the bar and ordered drinks....my friend received her wine rather quickly, while I waited for my Montana Mule (bourbon &amp; ginger juice)..
The drink menu offered about five different Mule combinations, so I decided to try one...

Shortly after everyone arrived, we were seated promptly even after being told we had to wait
another 25 min....after being seated at a large round table and another 20 min later - still no drink.  Our waitress mentioned the bartender was &#34;backed-up&#34;....Everyone placed their dinner order and after another 15 min. I finally received my Moscow Mule - in a beer mug, no less.  Apparently, they were out of copper mugs (I was told)...this was very odd to me, but whatever...I  didn&#39;t let that stop me from enjoying my drink, (with a straw) which happened to be very well made.  The bartender was not light handed in his pour of bourbon...

They brought out warm crusty bread first - enjoyed by all.  The 8 oz. Prime Rib I ordered was actually very good..thick cut &amp; cooked med rare...tender and seasoned well, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this.. Came w/a salad and one side.  Caesar salad was OK.  Mashed potatoes had the right consistency and flavor...I tasted a friend&#39;s Outlaw Ribeye (18 oz., $25, that&#39;s cheap), also cooked perfectly, a little fattier as a friend noted, and I agreed - yet everyone at the table who ordered this, scarfed it down none the less....the consensus was *good*..

They make a homemade barbecue sauce as well....I didn&#39;t notice this anywhere on the menu, you have to request it -  a friend mentioned having it before and I totally recommend this (especially if your opting for A1) - this is 10x&#39;s better and so tasty...you must try it.  They serve this to you in a warming crock and combine it at your table...

The Wedge Salad is NOT an iceberg &#34;wedge&#34; but layers of Romaine...
The Parmesan Creamed Spinach tasted healthy...light coating of cream with a crunchy parmesan topping and lots of fresh spinach...this is a must get.  Grilled Asparagus was simple and a great side...Corn fritters tasted just like corn fritters...I heard the burger &amp; Salmon dish was really good too....We brought a birthday cake with us (which they held in back prior to serving) so I didn&#39;t try any desserts....I noticed they have great lunch &amp; drink specials..

Throughout the night I will say we received very attentive service considering we had a large party with multiple ongoing requests, so in all fairness, even though I waited longer than I should have for my drink, she did a fabulous job dealing with our table and bringing out dishes in a timely manner - everything was served hot...They even sang Happy Birthday! (quite loudly I might add)...even better, and the Birthday Girl was the center of attention!

Speaking of LOUD - the dining room noise level was tripled in decibels.. I felt like I was in a crowded bar trying to have a conversation....we literally had to shout at one another in order to be heard....At some point, I just refrained from talking to anyone across from me...yes, the restaurant was busy, but whoever designed the acoustics here did a shabby job..

Total for table:  $300...You really can&#39;t beat that price for a decent steak dinner w/drinks, inviting ambiance and very accommodating service (minus the noise)...for these reasons,
LongHorn is worthy of 4 stars..

When you don&#39;t feel like spending an arm &amp; a leg on a good steak - this is a nice option...

They WILL take reservations but only a half hour before. That was different but it worked. We were also eating at 5:30 pm (somebody else&#39;s schedule ;~) and Schaumburg is still drinking and not eating yet so it worked.

Pizza&#39;s review was really helpful and we were wary of teh LOUD factor so got a large round table that was on the far end of the restaurant and quieter. Perfect. This is actually the old Houlihans and it is unrecognizable to me in a good way. I used to go here a frequently in a previous life to meet certain clients and you didn&#39;t come for the decor.

We had one fixable underdone steak but otherwise our 9 meals were spot on. Giuliano did a fantastic job taking a few moments to catch our ADD attention and explain how the sides and soup and salad etc worked; it was helpful and appreciated. I recommend ordering the larger of any steak as you almost always get a better cut, and take leftovers home. I got the 11 oz sirloin and the 6 and 8 looked sad. Delicious baked sweet potato option with cinnamon butter and grilled asparagus. Several chicken dish eaters commented it was delicious, very moist. 
Drinks were fast and some ok by the glass wine choices, 1/2 carafes too.
Service was attentive and very friendly from Giuliano.

The food is good here as well. My father always gets the portorhouse with no complaints. The rib eye and prime rib are also good choices for this location."

We had a large group twelve people.
The server was good except he was the drink person- then the water boy- then the order taker- the only time he had HELP was when food came out .....we were actually clearing the table off because no one bus the table..
We can not take it out on the server but management should of had 2  people working this table.
The food of course was good but I don&#39;t like the way they handled he serving one person can&#39;t be there n still waiting on other tables!!"

We got seated pretty quickly and got our drinks and orders in quickly as well. We ordered the sweet corn fritters to start it, they were good and came with a dipping sauce. Nice flavor combination.

I ordered the rib eye with asparagus and a cesar salad. The salad was decent but it really wasn&#39;t much dressing. Many restaurants overdo it with too much dressing, I would have liked a little more dressing at least.

The rib eye was just OK. It was one of the thinnest rib eye&#39;s I&#39;ve seen, I think it needs to be thicker to get good steak flavors. It was over seasoned so you couldn&#39;t really taste the natural flavor from the meat.

The service was good, there were some minor issues. The orders for two other salads got completely screwed up and we didn&#39;t have enough silverware and had to point that out.

I certainly didn&#39;t expect fine dining experience on the cheap but I had hoped the steak would have a better taste than it did"

Earlier this week, my &#34;work mom&#34; and I decided we needed to shop at Costco on Thursday night this week and we decided to make a night of it. She had been here previously with her husband and they loved it! She had raved about the place and their generous portions and the great food. I couldn&#39;t wait to come so it was a great suggestion for our casual mid-week dinner. 

We walked in to a somewhat empty restaurant directly after work (about 525pm) and I immediately noticed I loved the feel of the whole place. A lot wood, clean, kind staff and just an overall comfortable feeling place. You can come as you are and that&#39;s right up my alley!

After perusing the menu and knowing I wanted something with some flavor, I decided to get a ribeye steak. I was pleasantly surprised it was only $19.99, included a salad and a side dish. I upgraded to a Premium side and got the homemade Mac &amp; Cheese. It was awesome!! Totally worth the extra $1.59!!! 
My work mommy chose a bacon wrapped sirloin off their dinner specials for $12.99!! Her meal also included a salad and side dish. Wow. 

Our steaks came out and both looked awesome. She pointed out the glaze of sorts that came on her sirloin was quite over powering so she scraped it off. Maybe something to consider putting on the dish as a dipping cause, Longhorn? 

I cut into my steak and loved the first bite but sadly, after the second bite, I realized that it was quite tough and not cooked Medium as I had requested. It was a bit under cooked. A manager just happened to be walking past, so I grabbed him and he immediately took my plate back to have my steak remade and it was out a few minutes later. The allowed me to keep my Mac so I nibbled on that until the steak had come out. It was perfect. I was MUCH MUCH more pleased with my second steak. It was tender and even more flavorful than the first steak. I was happy as a clam!! 

We both enjoyed out meals. Our server, Vincent, was very nice and kept us happy from start to finish even with the issue we had with the steak. 

The kind manager treated us to dessert, which was more than necessary, but very much appreciated, so we got to taste a sampler of their chocolate mousse cake (OMG!!), a carmel apple strudel type deal and some cheesecake with strawberry sauce. All were awesome. Even for this chickie that does not like cheesecake!!

Overall, a very good meal. I will definitely return. I hope I don&#39;t run into the same issues, but I get that these things happen. Such is life.

We had made reservations for the Olive Garden across the way first and had told them we would be there tentatively between 8:45 and 9:00pm for 15 people as we didn&#39;t know how long the ceremony would be.  We got there at 8:55 and was told they gave our table to someone else.  To say I was embarrassed is an understatement.  
I called Longhorn and Josh worked some magic and we were able to be within conversation distance of each other as they were pretty swamped with other last minute graduation parties.  Thank you again Longhorn for making my daughters graduation memorable!"

The menu is mostly fattening, fried foods and very cheap cuts of meat.Ordered the chicken and strawberry salad...eh. Very bland dressing (no flavor, really). I make better salads and chicken, and I rarely cook."

To be honest, when my in-laws said they wanted to come here for steak on a Wednesday night, I was a bit skeptical.  I was expecting it to be a thinly sliced steak you&#39;d see at Chili&#39;s or Friday&#39;s for that price.  To my surprise, it definitely was not.  I got a perfectly cooked Medium Rare Rib Eye steak that was plenty flavorful.  The steak wasn&#39;t as good as a steak I had from Ruth&#39;s Chris, but it was still pretty damn good, and you can&#39;t complain with that price.  Overall I was pretty happy with it.

The sides that came with it were ok, and you get a salad with your meal, but I went with a Mushroom Truffle soup for an upcharge instead, which was absolutely delicious.

The service was pretty spot on as well, as it was a Wednesday night and it wasn&#39;t very busy.

The restaurant is also brand spankin new since they took over the old Houlihan&#39;s spot at Woodfield Mall so everything is nice and clean here.

Overall, the steak was very good, and for $25 for a 19oz Rib Eye??  Obviously, I&#39;ll still indulge every so often and hit up a nice steak house, but I think this might be my new go to for decently priced steak."

We arrived at about 6 PM and it was not crowded. We should have taken that as a sign. It took a little while for our server to approach us, but he seemed pleasant enough. We skipped drinks and appetizers and got down to business. They had great specials on their menu, and I opted for their Sirloin in a bourbon sauce. I was bad though - they had a wide selection if side dishes and I chose french fries.

It took quite a while for the meal to arrive. In fact, during that time I had the chance to count the number of tables that were filled and the number of waiters. There was about one waiter for every two occupied tables so you would expect good service. But nooooo. 

When our dinner arrived it looked very appealing. The steak was glazed in the bourbon sauce and they served another small bowl of the sauce on the side. The steak was tasty, but some of it was so tough I couldn&#39;t eat it. Too bad. The fries were okay.

Getting the check was another experience in waiting.

In fairness to the restaurant, my wife ordered the same item and she said hers was fine. This won&#39;t be on my list of restaurants to return to."

That all changed today!!  We arived to a very busy area and were told a wait of 15-20 minutes for a table of 2. The time came and went with the host leaving and being replaced.  We were passed over several times by parties of 2 and 4 who arrived later after us.  Finally the last couple waiting longer than us and complaining about such a long wait were paged.  They handed over their remote pager and were told to just stand there and wait longer.  That was my last straw after waiting 35 minutes and noticing empty tables not cleared for up to 5 minutes.  I turned in our pager and the new host said we were next.  I told him too many other later parties had already passed us by and left.  NEVER AGAIN!"

Sign up for the club and get a free appetizer up to $9.99. Celebrated a bday here and they brought us a nice house desert which is always nice and a good reason to go back..

Ordered the party platter which had stuffed mushrooms which were very creamy and perfectly crusted and cooked. The Buffalo wraps were a little light on the chicken but the cilantro sauce made up for the taste. 

Had the new buttered tilapia ( i had mine blamed with paprika) very light fish perfectly cooked and fresh. Asked for your potatoes to be loaded. 

Defiantly will be back... not the best but definately n the better end of most chain retaurants."

It&#39;s nicer than other steak chains, but you know, it&#39;s still a steak chain.  I came here with my sister and although we both ordered the same steak, hers Med Rare and mine Rare (you can always cook a steak more, you can&#39;t uncook it), hers came out perfectly and mine was more medium. I didn&#39;t send it back because it wasn&#39;t inedible, just underwhelming. The sides I chose were so-so, but there were other appetizing looking sides to choose from. The star of the meal was the appetizer course. The corn fritters and homemade chips stole the show. I&#39;d come back and make a meal of appetizers and salad!
Service was good- I was never without a refill. Ambiance was nice. It didn&#39;t feel tacky like most chains around the area."

The Cesar salad tasted sour was gross I didn&#39;t eat it. The baked potato was okay but not much toppings on it less than halfway I was eating a plain potato. This place has nothing on outback.

My co-workers and I came here on a recommendation from the guy running the training class we&#39;re in. We&#39;re from California so we wanted a nice steakhouse for dinner one night.

Right from the start, I walked to the restroom and the amount of trash (straw wrappers, empty sugar packets, etc) lying on the floor was absolutely ridiculous. This place was filthy.

Our waitress got the order for our appetizer wrong and instead of replacing the wrong order, tried to add the correct order in addition to the wrong order instead of taking back the wrong order.

I ordered the Flo&#39;s filet, mid-rare like anyone who really enjoys a good steak would order it. The steak was cooked VERY inconsistently. The outer half inch was medium rare, but the center was pretty much rare. Not only that, but there was a chunk of fat on the side. Now anyone who has had a decent filet knows that there should NEVER be an ounce of fat on a filet. Completely unacceptable for a filet.

The best thing I can say about this place is they have a decent wine selection...from California of course, which is where I&#39;ll go back to in order to enjoy a steak cooked the proper way."

It wasn&#39;t too crowded so we were seated right away. Followed by drink orders from our waitress who was friendly and on top of everything. 

Started with a small loaf of warm bread that was delicious. Next came a Cesar salad that was fresh but a little too much dressing for my liking. 

I ordered the Flat Iron steak with baked sweet potato. The steak was cooked just right. And boy was it tender with great flavor. The sweet potato was also good with cinnamon and butter for flavoring. 
I would have tried a dessert but I was stuffed at that point. Maybe next time."

The portion size was way larger than I expected.  Loved the fried asparagus, rock grilled shrimp, and sweet potato.

I did not love how slow the service was.  A dinner that we anticipated to be 1 hour ended up being 2.  Ridiculous.

I asked for dressing for our Cesar salads.  We were starving and done with our naked salads by the time that it arrived.  We did not bother to ask for more butter for our bread.  1 rounded tablespoon for a loaf really did not suffice.

The place was hopping and we spent almost an hour waiting at the bar for a table. They don&#39;t take reservations, but we were hungry and I was convinced we needed to try this chain that was impressing my friends so much. The bartender was kinda aloof. I was glad to move when that buzzer went off. 

It was like we entereda completely different world from that point on and the food and service were quite good. Whew!

So last night was double date night. It was icy out (Longhorn: Salt your parking lot please) and I really wanted to stay warm at home, but we ventured out with our friends. Overall, the food and the service were really good again...on a Friday night!  We couldn&#39;t believe it when over two hours has passed and no one was antsy or annoyed about something. Last night&#39;s choices included cheesy stuffed mushrooms that I didn&#39;t try, but were enjoyed on the other side of the table. The Wild West Shrimp which is a hearty serving to share with a few folks. And my husband who normally stays away from anything seafood related really likes this dish. Their house salad comes with diced tomatoes, diced cucumbers, shredded cheese and croutons. I was surprised at how nice it was. The honey wheat bread was warm, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. It smelled great when it hit the table!  I do wish the butter wasn&#39;t rock hard when it arrived though. Add to that a couple of well seasoned ribeyes, some NY strip steaks, some loaded baked potatoes, seasoned French fries and a baked sweet potato with butter, cinnamon and brown sugar and you&#39;ve got a pretty nice meal for a chain restaurant. Oh, and a butterscotch pudding may have snuck its way into our take-home bag. 

But the highlight for me was the gal who came by to make the table side steak sauce. I knew her and she immediately knew me. She was my favorite server at a local restaurant we haven&#39;t frequented in years due to a change in food quality. Longhorn is lucky to have her!  That was a really pleasant surprise. 

Our friends had heard some negative things about this location, but I&#39;m happy to report but they were smiling from ear to ear when we left. I know why my friends are happy to eat here frequently."

Our table dined on the Parmesan asparagus, soft pretzels, a rancher burger, the Parmesan garlic chicken, a chicken avocado sandwich, the chicken &amp; strawberry salad, key lime pie, and molten lava cake. Overall, we thought the food to be tasty. 

Here&#39;s why I knocked off a couple of stars...the service was a bit lacking. Our server was sweet, but here&#39;s how our evening started...a spilled Arnold Palmer all over the table and our laps. Yes, accidents happen...and our server was very helpful in trying to clean up the table. However, I had a HUGE wet spot on the front of my dress and the drink was all in my ballet flats....eeewww. It even got my friend who was next to me, her dress was soaked as well. My phone, which was on the table, was drenched as well...ugh! Anywho, we moved on from the incident and ordered the appetizers and our entrees. We had to cancel one of the appetizers because they didn&#39;t have a a requested dipping sauce. For the entree one of my friends ordered the tilapia and halfway through our appetizers we were informed that they ran out of the tilapia. So my friend had to pick out something else to order. She went with the strawberry and chicken salad. Well, when the entree came out, her salad came out sans the chicken....ummmmm....ok. She asked our server if there was supposed to be chicken and the server didn&#39;t think so, but she would check and sure enough the kitchen made a mistake. So, she brought out a piece of chicken 10 minutes into our dinner. 

Now, after a whole spilled drink on my lap (mind you I have to now get my dress professionally cleaned) and an entree coming out with one of the main ingredients missing...wouldn&#39;t the server/management offer something to the customer? I would think perhaps a comp dessert at the least. Nope...NOTHING was comped from the bill.

I think in good faith, the server/management should&#39;ve exercised their judgement and done something for us. Don&#39;t get me wrong, our server was sweet...but, ultimately, she lacked the judgement to do something for us at the end of the meal. None of us complained because we aren&#39;t really the type to demand a freebie, but this was something I would think is common sense! Not even my Arnold Palmer was comped....and I had to wear it all night! My dress, shoes, and phone are all sticky.

I ordered shrimp that was nearly cold by the time it arrived.... The plate was &#34;hot&#34; though.... According to the server, not actually in reality.  

I know it is not 100% her fault though, they seemed really understaffed in my opinion due to the filthy table that was next to us for 45+ min.

It&#39;s still dirty right now......"

So I came back, giving the place another try.  
I again asked about the difference between the ribeye and outlaw ribeye.   He replied that the outlaw comes with a bone.  I, knowing the actual answer from many previous times, asked if it was cooked or seasoned differently, to which  he answered both are on the grill and I asked if he was sure, he said ya. I told him he was wrong and he should check on that fact and because of that he treated us poorly the rest of the time we were there. 

I did have a chat with their assistant manager, Mike, and I shared my concern for the incorrect response and the fact that the last 2 times I was here paying they got my steak wrong.  They finally got it spot on today, though my dad&#39;s was a bit rare in the middle and bleedy cuz it was just a bit under mid-rare in the middle.  It was still good though.  I am glad they decided to actually check temps instead of eyeballing cuz they were blowing that everytime I was here in the past. 

Cynthia, per Mike, has been promoted to head trainer and she was very nice to us even though she was not our waiter.  She was our waiter during the elite event.  I talked to her briefly and she hopefully will make some good training changes cuz their normal waitstaff just doesn&#39;t cut it.  

Based on service and value for my money, Outback still beats this place hands down and they are actually closer to my house by like 5 minutes.  I&#39;m just going there for now on."

Messed up our order, brought out the dinner before our salads .  We didn&#39;t complain but asked for the salads afterward.  Now eating realize the pasta was cold .  They offer to make a fresh one , but return over 15 minutes later,  only with it reheated which ruined the dish all together.   We also never received the bread  &amp; butter tray and when I asked the server explained they only bring upon request .  Really ? With soup and salads &amp; full dinners ?   They always bring it first after our drinks - and we look forward to it.   

The manager was very apologetic about all the mistakes, however no offer to comp the pasta or anything else.  Unsure if we will go back, which is a shame since the food there is usually very good."

Since I tend to prefer chicken over steak, the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes was perfectly prepared and delicious.

On my birhday, I&#39;m allowed to choose the restaurant where my family should celebrate it with me. My sister called in advance and was told they do not take reservations but to call ahead and our name would be added to the list quickly. She called at 5:20pm on Saturday, Nov 3. She was told there would be a 40 minute wait from that point. She contacted all of us individually by text and the 7 of us (my sister, her husband, their 2 kids, my dad, my boyfriend and I) met there at 6pm. The hostess said it would be another 40 minutes. It turned into an hour with the 2 kids sitting at the bar occupying themselves as the rest of us stood around them and ordered drinks.

Once seated, our orders were taken immediately. It took my boyfriend, who never gets up or complains about anything, to ask the hostess about our salads; it is an appetizer, included with the entree, what was taking our server over an hour to bring them to our table!? It was nice for the hostess to bring us another basket of bread but seriously, a manager to come over and speak with us would&#39;ve been better service

The food came to the table lukewarm, just right for the kids and my boyfirend who prefer it that way. No chance the rest of us were going to say anything about it as we were starving!

You know the experience has to be one of the most disasterous for my sister, who favors Claim Jumper, to be writing an angry review at the dinner table and her 8 year old daughter shouting, &#34;I&#39;m never coming here ever again!&#34;. 

Our round table was in the middle of the aisle, between booths, the kitchen and the bathroom. People everywhere surrounded us, walked by us, seated after us, served before us. You could not miss us!

The manager was a coward. I&#39;m used to one stoppinig by and asking how things are going. If you can&#39;t have the manager show themselves, have the chef do it. One of them is responsible and should hear the wrath from well paying customers.

The waiter asked me if I wanted a birthday dessert and I politely declined it. He insisted I order one and have it to go so I ask for the Key Lime pie. It took so long for him to bring it out that we thought he forgot about me. We were already standing with coats on collectively shuffling out when he intercepted me with a bag. 

There are way better steakhouses wtih better service that&#39;s it&#39;s too easy to forget about this place."

This place is a good one, but it&#39;s pretty much Outback with a different decor.  I&#39;ll be honest, I prefer Outback, BUT, LongHorn has some things that other steakhouses do not.  

Observe:

1.  Stuffed Filets.  These were definitely good, but they use the filets with the fat on the tail.  Blech.  If you&#39;re not as picky as I am, you&#39;ll love them.  They also have an impressive list of different steaks to choose from too.

2.  Spice and Ranch.  Two of my favorite things.  Because this is a &#34;Texan&#34; restaurant, there are a lot of items with a Southwest flair...you know, jalapenos, chili, spicier cheeses, ranch, sour cream, etc.  All delicious.

3.  DELICIOUS French Onion Soup.  (And while we are on the subject of onions, LongHorn, I refuse to say the word T&#39;Onion for that appetizer [which was decent, by the way] and you can&#39;t make me!)    

4.  A HUGE menu.  Bad for an indecisive person like me, but great for a group of people who all like different things.  You definitely don&#39;t have to like steak to come here.  It&#39;s all about options, people.

The only real downfall with this place was the beer list...best thing on there was Blue Moon.  I guess I can go a night without drinking though for that soup.  It was that good."

I&#39;ve heard from friends that they love it but I&#39;m not willing to drive too far for chain restaurant steak. 
Went to lunch with mom and had a great experience. 
Our server, Dominicka (I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s how you spell her name) was EXCELLENT! Such great personality and wanted to make sure everything we ordered was perfect. Service is super important to me because it represents the face of the business. Plus, nobody wants a bad experience. 

The food was cooked properly and was delicious! I had the filet and mashed potatoes but it didn&#39;t come with gravy. Dominicka made sure I had some type of gravy on my dish (on the side of course). How great is that? 

I can&#39;t say anything bad about this place because I had a good experience from the minute I walked in. Actually, I was annoyed at first but that only lasted for about 3 minutes. I was walking in with an infant in a car seat on my arms and a diaper bag in the other hand. The hostess stood at her booth and watched me kind of struggle opening the door. It was 2 in the afternoon and the place was NOT busy at all. I don&#39;t understand why she couldn&#39;t have stepped two feet to the front door to open it for me BUT I guess some people don&#39;t get it.

My expectations were high thanks to a fantastic Yelp dining experience this past summer.  I was fortunate to be invited to the excellent meal that was served and regarded my Outlaw Ribeye as one of the best steaks I ever tasted.
I returned recently with two other diners after carrying on how great a meal I had.  I ordered the Outlaw Ribeye and it was hard for me to believe that it was the same cut of meat.  It was tough with not much flavor.  The only thing consistent was the seasoning.  My dining partners ordered the rainbow trout and commented that it was &#34;OK&#34;.
We had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table.  They have bowls of peanuts that you can munch on at the bar.  There was a mess of peanut shells next to us while the bartenders griped about who was supposed to go on break first.  Not very professional.
Like I said, I had high expectations but they weren&#39;t met."

A friendly greeter took them to their table; located clear on the other end of the restaurant, in front of the entrance to the restrooms. The three women adjusted their seat assignment on their own.

Ample time was given for ordering and the server of the three women was pleasant and seemingly efficient. And then, the three women waited, and waited, and waited.

Other diners entered LongHorn, were served, and still the three women waited.

Finally, portions of meals ordered by the three women arrived at the table. One meal was cold; another meal was tough; and one meal was just right.

Finally, as if coming out of a stupor, one of the women called the server over, who quickly ushered over Dave, the very pleasant manager, who responded with force that he would see to it that everything would be fine; to the liking of the three women.

The three women watched, as they waited for their reorders to arrive, as Dave went from table to table: in part, greeting and in part doing damage control for other diners.

I&#39;m not sure why LongHorn was off their game. I do know that the manager truly wanted to make things right, in all respects. The women received piping hot meals, and an extremely nice key lime pie for dessert: all complimentary, thanks to the manager. Which was the right thing to do.

Based upon his service alone, this update is saved from being a 2 star debacle. All I can say is that I hope LongHorn will reevaluate what happens at their establishment from start to finish."

The food here is not terrible consider the price I am paying. If I want better quality steak, I should not be coming here an go else where.

What this place make it so terrible is the service, the staff is terrible.

I came here with my family to celebrate my two brother&#39;s birthday. (their b-days are so close, we do a joint celebration). I asked our waiter to bring us two desserts from the menu and put it on a separate bill since it&#39;s their birthdays.

I am going to skip through the part the salad took over 15 mins to come and drink refills took time as well. For a store that was not that busy, he was very slow.

After we completed our meal and wait over 15 mins,  the desserts I request came. Unfortunately, the waiter comes with the cakes saying, &#34;I don&#39;t know, she just ordered these so I don&#39;t know which one gets which one.&#34; and then places two cakes in front of the boys.
There were 7 people on the table, he brought 2 spoons. I had to yell across the room to get 5 more spoons since he never come by due to the reason they were so busy getting ready to close.
Oh, by the way, no birthday song. I heard them sing tunes for other customers before.

Before the check, he comes back to the table asking very loudly, &#34;what should I do with the bill for the cakes? should I put it on a different bill?&#34; I answered &#34;please do&#34; and he does it, but my brothers heard the whole conversation.

I was really fed up with the waiter&#39;s attitude. What is really sad is he probably thinks I was the rude one because I was asking for water, spoons, and take out containers in a loud voice from across the room. Yes, he does complete these task, but I would not have to do any of those things if he does his job the way he is meant to.

I noticed the trend here that service gets terrible as it gets to closing time. The manager is busy closing the registers and it took over 10 mins to get my credit card back after I gave it to them, and the waiters are way to busy cleaning up.

I only have one thing to say, there&#39;s other steak places you can afford for the same price and have much better customer service than here."

decor was nice though, people were nice, just everything was really slow.  it wasn&#39;t even like the place was busy when we got there at 5PM.  It did get busier later on, but 

If it takes so freakin long to dress 8 salads, they should just put the dressing on the side, it&#39;s longhorn steakhouse, not gibsons, it&#39;s not too many of the patrons would expect to have their salads be perfectly dressed with caesar dressing ... 

anyway, main entrees took just as long to come out as everything else.  funny thing is that out of 8 adults, only 1 steak was ordered, so not sure what took so long.  my hubby ordered the pork chops.  they were barely seasoned and there was so much fat on them.  bleh.  their french onion soup was really great though.

We went at around 6:30PM on a Wednesday. Seated promptly, however getting someone to take our drink orders was a bit of a wait.

When we went to order our food, we were informed that they were out of prime rib, the reason we came. Our server asked if we needed a minute to decide on something different. We did.

When he came back, he sarcastically asked &#34;will you still be dining with us tonight?&#34;. I know I did not even try to mask my disappointment with the prime rib, however sarcasm was not helping things.

We both ended up ordering the rib-eye, my wife well done (I know, embarrassing) and myself medium rare. When we got them, they  were delivered by someone else who did not ask us to check if they were prepared right, luckily, they were (sort of).

Both steaks were HEAVILY seasoned/salted, making them barely edible. With what we been through to that point, we just decided to bear it and drank lots of ice tea.

While we ate, another pair of servers stood near our table talking rather loudly. Obviously one was a trainee and they were going through how to tell the table numbers and the method to decide who served which table. If you are interested, drop us a line, we know the methods intimately now as they covered it 3 or 4 times over a 5 minute period stand no more than 3 feet from our table.

At the very least, after my noticeable disappointment in the issue with the prime rib, the manager should have stopped by our table with an apology. We may give Longhorn another chance, however I doubt it will be this one.."

When I hear the word steak house, I imagine a dimly lit restaurant that is very intimate with a huge selection of steaks and an elegant feel with polished servers. Long Horn Steakhouse isn&#39;t that. Long Horns is more commercialized. It&#39;s a wannabe steak house.

I ordered a rib eye, it was succulent and delicious, with an amazing char and very well cooked. The service was so-so. Our waiter did get everything we wanted, how we wanted it; but he wasn&#39;t exactly Johnny-on-the-spot. More slowly walking than actually hustling.

Bottom Line: This isn&#39;t a steak house. But they do have steaks."

We phoned ahead at 5 to get on the list for a table of 6. We were told 40 minutes. It took about 1.5 hours to get our table. 

We complained about this. A manager tried to apologize but came off as very pandering and saccharine.  The tall skinny male manager was just terrible in his people skills. Probably thinks he&#39;s super nice, but it came off as terribly condescending and uninterested.  

Our waitress came. I ordered a beer (it never arrived). We ordered our food. Took an hour to arrive. My moms steak, ordered medium, was well done. My sons steak was so over-cooked it was ruined as was my other sons chicken. 

Total of 2.5 hours waited for a crummy meal.  Another manager came by several times to check on us and, upon seeing our ruined food comped our bill, which was nice (to not have to pay for meat that sat under a heat lamp for 15 minutes).

Will not return."

In fact, I want some now and I just ate there three hours ago.

The service is not great, but not horrible either - then again, both times I&#39;ve gone were late on Sunday nights so no overwhelming servers, but probably ready to go home and pass out servers. 

The selection and pricing are fine in the sense of it&#39;s a steakhouse chain, nothing too fancy and the only drawback to me is the bad country music. But duh, it&#39;s called Longhorn so I can&#39;t expect anything else."

We had a gift card to use and had quite low expectations. I mean, it&#39;s a chain steakhouse.

The service was excellent. It might be that we went for a late lunch and were one of the few patrons there, but our drinks were never empty and the guy was very helpful, suggesting items on the menu.

My husband got a filet with green beans and I tried a chicken dish off of their under 500-calorie menu. Both items were cooked exactly as we specified.  The portions were appropriate and filling, and the seasoning and toppings on my chicken were awesome. I can&#39;t believe my whole lunch was less than 500 calories because it was really tasty.

My husband also enjoyed his steak, which was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The meat was tender and well-seasoned to the point that he didn&#39;t need steak sauce, salt or pepper.

We were out of there in a very manageable 40 minutes with full bellies, but we weren&#39;t feeling stuffed. I&#39;d go again, too."

First, if possible, I would give ZERO stars.

My boyfriend, my mom and I went there for an early (3:00) dinner on New Year&#39;s day.  We were given a pager for when our table was ready, 10-15 minutes.  While we were waiting with others for our tables, the host kept asking people in the waiting area who was first.  What&#39;s with the pagers if you aren&#39;t going to use them?  And, you can&#39;t keep track of your customers? 

It took close to 20 minutes to get a drink from the bar.  After the waitress left our table the first time, it was apparent that she was either having some cocktails or was heavily medicated on something.  VERY spaced out and strange.  Strange enough to make us all uncomfortable.    The entire time, service was awful.  We eat out often and are generally in and out in an hour and a half.

She was scarce, and spent at least 5 minutes apologizing to the table behind us for poor service and their bad experience.  At the booth next to them, the wait staff was using that empty booth to clear tables onto.  I assume they were short on bus staff.  (Short on wait staff too.  I was in the ladies room and another server was on the phone with her other job saying &#34;I won&#39;t be on time.  I&#39;m still at my other job and I have 8 tables.  We are really short staffed&#34;.  Nice.)

We ordered.  The couple at the bar table next to our booth said, after about 45 minutes &#34;Do you think you are going to eat any time in 2013?&#34;  We laughed.  Better than the alternative.

At around 5:00 (!!) our food arrived.  We ordered VERY SIMPLE dishes that should not have required so much time.  My boyfriend had soup and salad, I had salad and mac and cheese, my mom had a prime rib sandwich.  When my mom attempted to cut her sandwich and couldn&#39;t because it was so tough and my mac and cheese was inedible, we decided we had enough.

We couldn&#39;t find our waitress so I went to the host stand and asked that someone take our food away, bring our check and ask the manager to come and see us.  After 5 minutes or so, none of these 3 things happened.  I have NEVER done this before, but we left.  As we reached the front door the (condescending) manager asked what the issue was.  I kept is polite and succinct and said that the service and food were awful.  She offered coupons for &#34;next time.&#34;  We indicated that there would not be a next time.

I have been to other LongHorn locations and had awesome food.  Was really hoping for the same here.  

Given the number of restaurants in the area, we will just go elsewhere.  (We ended up going to Champps that night and had a great experience.)"

Service was good, steaks were good (I had the sirloin topped with bacon and a runny egg....WIN). All the steaks come with salad and your choice of side so even without appetizers you&#39;ll leave full. Their baked sweet potato is AMAZING. 

Had to dock a star because of 2 reasons. First, my limeade was terrible. It tasted like watered down lemonade with no hint of lime...only had a few sips. Second, I&#39;m not a fan of screaming babies. Especially screaming babies that scream during my entire meal. Every table was shooting glares at the screaming baby table but they seemed oblivious and management just seemed to ignore it. 

Good place to go if you don&#39;t want to shell out $150+ for 2 people for steak. 2 entrees and 2 soft drinks only came out to $50 so you&#39;re better off coming here for the overall quality and value then the Outback down the street."

The stuffed steaks sizzling on the screen looked so good I almost licked my TV. I had to have one in my belly on my birthday. That sold me to visit the newly opened Long Horn in Schaumburg for my birthday. Saturday rolled around and we called to make a reservation. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations, but we were told we could call ahead later in the evening. We wanted to eat around 7pm, so at 6:00 PM we called back and asked what the wait was. They said 45 min - 1hour. We put our name on the list and killed some time elsewhere until 7pm. 

We arrived and were promptly greeted. We told the hostess we had called ahead and she pulled up the record and said our table should be ready within 5 min. The place was packed. I mean shoulder to shoulder in the front of the restaurant. Luckily, 2 min past before our pager was blinking and vibrating.

We scored a large booth that seats 2-4 adults comfortably. But the dining room was poorly designed or furnished. They had large empty spaces with no tables. That explains the long wait. They could have easily squeezed in one more large round table in the 2 areas I could see from my seat. More on this in a bit.

The server came up, introduced herself, and took our drink orders. She was friendly and polite. Brought us waters without asking which in my opinion, a plus. Her knowledge of the menu was so-so. She knew the main points like the temps and looks of a steak. But my girlfriend ordered the rice pilaf as her side and the server said that&#39;s not on the menu. When we showed her, she responded with &#34;no one ever orders that...&#34; Our personal service overall was ok. Not slacking but then again not anything to write home about.

Throughout the course of our meal, we over heard several unhappy patrons with their seats. The hostesses did not keep very good track of what tables were available and on several occasions would walk patrons over to a table that seats 8, only to ask how many is in your party? These were all parties of 2 or 3 and the hostess would then make them wait for another table to be cleared. This happened 3 times! One of the parties complained to the manager. I don&#39;t blame her. She had to wait 45 min to finally being told a table was available, only to be told no? Again... if they had filled the space ever with a smaller round 4-6 top table, it would help out the seating shenanigans that ensued that night. 

Oh and the food? Good. We had the Texas T&#39;Onions as an appetizer. They are really good. The sauce is an excellent pairing. I had the white cheddar and bacon stuffed filet while my girlfriend had Shrimp Scampi Sirloin. Both were prepared well. We finished our meals with the Golden Fried Cheesecake Bites. This is my first time trying fried cheesecake. Not what I was expecting. I was bummed because it was a texture and temperature thing. Threw me off. 

Overall it was a satisfactory visit. It still smelled new and some of the servers are very &#34;by the book&#34; and rehearsed. The experience was again, nothing to write home about. I think I would visit this place again in a few months to let the &#34;new-ness&#34; wear off before attempting to eat here again. 

My tip: Call ahead for a seat."
longhorn-steakhouse-schaumburg-2,Bob P.,10CsWZNJzWmiz2Ak7L7I4g,"Streamwood, IL",0,1,0,4,19,QZ48zkQ_gWHeMH3C65JqTA,2.0,2012-12-13,"So the name is LongHorn not Lone Star. 

On the old Holihan&#39;s site at the corner of WoodField Mall, this new building is spaceous as if  it still waiting for half a dozen tables to show up from corporate.

The staff seemed frazzled when we got there, taking 5 minutes to seat us at a table. Of course the hostess desk is right at the door, so everyone is on top of each other even though the place was empty (just before the shoppers gave up for the night for dinner at 6:30). Wait staff seemed equally off key for the night.

When we got there it sounded like it could be a loud night of listening to kids. But they seem to be clearing out within a few minutes as the tables turned. They never went on a wait, and mostly only did one turn with everyone coming between 6:30 to 7:00. I must say I was pleasantly surprised being the week before Christmas, I expected a mob for a Mall restaurant.  The &#39;wood grain&#39; carpeting and architecture has an interesting affect on sound. It &#39;looks&#39; loud and at first feels loud, but when you sit at the booth (most of the tables are booth), it really is pretty quiet and pleasant. 

I asked about the online special (turns out it was for Lone Star, not LongHorn) but they thought it was because they were new. OK, up the price on my bad. Did not really express much concern for a customer thinking there was one price only to see that the special was not. This is another Darden concept (Olive Garden, Red Lobster and more). That means within a few miles of this restaurant you can hit 5 Darden concepts almost within walking distance (Olive Garden is 50 yards). If you don&#39;t like this concept, take your gift card and head down the street.

Decent unsweetened brewed iced tea. Although I noticed that while mine had strength, some of the others in the next tables were getting pretty weak stuff. For fizzy stuff they serve Coke products and a full bar.

They have a nice multigrain bread. but seemed to be running out when we arrived. We got just a few pieces. When we asked for more they were apoligetic about the rest needing to be warmed up. The fresher batch was better (although the &#39;whipped&#39; butter was really solid.  They use cute wire basket with paper to make the small portion look bigger. The size is fine, just funny how they try to hide it.

I ordered the Flat Iron Steak (who&#39;da thunk - LongHorn has steaks). Nice buttery topping, without being too much, just enough for a &#39;sauce&#39; style dip. Pleasant saltiness without being an &#39;Outback&#39; salt-lick.

I ordered Medium Rare, Dave ordered Medium Well. His was correct. Mine was half correct - the other half was Rare.  Not sure how that happens. I am not talking about outside and inside (of course the outside was more done then the inside on both halves). But the &#39;left side&#39; was Medium Rare, some cooking on the inside, outside still juicy. The &#39;right side&#39; was Rare - not cooked, cool and the juices still in the meat.  Also, mine was a 1/3 gristle. No one really asked how it was after I started eating it.   It was not that big a piece (8oz), so the challenges were interesting for such a small piece to not be evenly cooked.

The &#39;fresh&#39; vegetables were mostly good (could have used a few more pieces) except the pea pods (seemed frozen before over cooking).  The sweet potato was delicious - well baked. I had the butter and cinnamon-sugar on the side. Not gigantic, but more then adequate.

Not sure if I would visit again, and probably not put as a regular stop except for those that want an easy to find &#39;safe&#39; chain that can be seen from 90/53/355 intersection. Far Far better then Olive Garden across the street.

A shout out to Darden for supporting American Red Cross Disaster Relief - &#39;LongHorn and other Darden restaurants are members of the Red Cross Annual Disaster Giving Program and donate meals to help feed local families affected by natural disasters.&#39;"

We stopped by the Hoffman Estates location this week. The reviews for both locations are all over the place, and I&#39;d been to to the Batavia location one time about a year ago, with good results, so I honored my Daughter&#39;s request to go to this location.

I usually go for Omelets if I know they are good. This one was outstanding. They bake the omelets here. I had Ham, Cheese and Onion and it came out perfectly cooked and incredibly fluffy. The style would be similar to Richard Walker&#39;s for those who have tried that place.

My daughter had the french toast and bacon. The bacon here is thick, and she says it&#39;s the best anywhere.

I also had chicken sausage, which was fine. My sister had a spinach omelet, and we both had coffee. The coffee was excellent. It&#39;s Kona, and they serve it with real cream upon request.  The service was friendly and prompt.  

My only reason for not going the full 5 stars, is that the tables and seating are a bit tired. Not a big deal, but a small area where they can improve.

This is &#39;our&#39; breakfast spot. So much so that it&#39;s gotten to the point that it&#39;s just assumed that AV is the destination. 
If we are thinking about going elsewhere, we need call it by name otherwise we just say &#39;breakfast&#39; and know Apple Villa is the plan of attack.

I usually change it up to order something new each visit, but it&#39;s almost to the point that I&#39;m out of options (haven&#39;t tried any lunch dishes - all breakfast).
Everything has been enjoyable, including the Banana Nut French Toast ordered in error (long, but delicious, story).

Highly recommended dishes include: 
- Banana Bread Toast (unreal) - this is different from the Banana Nut French Toast!!
- Corned Beef Hash [non-skillet] Skillet - the skillets are plated without the actual skillet 
- Eggs Benedict [Cumberbatch] - Classic
- Biscuits &amp; Gravy - Also Classic

I&#39;m sure that list will grow after more visits.

Another peculiar thing we enjoy here is the coffee. I say &#39;peculiar&#39; because coffee is coffee....but this coffee is really good.
I don&#39;t know what they put in it, but I&#39;m glad they do, and I&#39;m tempted to ask them to leave the pot (maybe George Washington could even help me out).

Pro Tip: Get there early. Pretty straightforward for a breakfast place, but being so close to Willow Creek, you run the risk of possibly getting VERY cozy in the vestibule with strangers. They do a good job of managing the wait when they can (can&#39;t usher people out) however if you have the option to go at 9 or 10, I&#39;d choose 9 every time for dibs.

I&#39;ll be back asap, but in the meantime I&#39;ll be planning my next order so I can try something else to add to my breakfast resume."

The 2-star rating derives from our sad experience with strawberry toppings, as ridiculous as it sounds.  Both my husband and I ordered the &#34;Two Eggs&#34; breakfast with pancakes.  I prefer plain pancakes, but when the waitress asked my husband if he would like strawberries, blueberries, or chocolate chips with his pancakes, his interest was sparked and he ordered the strawberry.  (She made no mention of an extra charge, although it&#39;s always safe to assume there will be one.  Not a problem usually.)

When the food arrived, we chuckled to ourselves and said, &#34;I hope there&#39;s not TOO much of an up charge for those strawberries!&#34;  It was two small-in-size strawberries, sliced thinly, and placed on top.  We truly had a good laugh because the presentation was just so meager.  Almost comical.  Like someone did it on purpose as a joke.

What was not as comical was the check.  There was a $2.75 surcharge for the &#34;strawberry version&#34; of the Two-Egg Breakfast.  Maybe for a homemade organic strawberry jam flown all the way from Amish Country....but, for two-ish small strawberries, again...laughable. 

Think twice about upgrading your pancakes here, I&#39;m sad to say."

The first time I had enjoyed it more than this time. In addition to the slow service or lack thereof, the food was also very bland. Usually, I&#39;m not even someone who has a salty palate either but for both my husband and I, we agreed that both of the dishes we ordered really needed more seasoning. 

I had ordered the Cranberry Turkey Flatbread back in February of this year, the same dish now cost $10.50 (compared to $9 before) and it tasted much more bland and dry this time around. I had really like this dish before, I even took a photo tip to recommend it. Today, it tastes like it was taken out of a bag and that was it. It had no flavor and barely has any cranberry or cranberry sauce to help with the taste. It was also barely warmed up. 

My husband ordered the Denver Skillet $10.50 and it had no seasoning whatsoever. We didn&#39;t see much ham that was suppose to be in it. In fact, we didn&#39;t see it at all-- we think now that they gave us the wrong order, perhaps all vegetarian. Also, a small orange juice (not even fresh squeeze) was $3.50. It tasted like juice from a carton and nothing special. 

Besides the food, the service was very lacking. They seem to be low staffed everywhere. When we first came in, there was no host present and at the end, we waited over 25 min to just get our check and food wrapped up. I had to wave down the hostess for my check because our waitress was too busy the entire time. We didn&#39;t get any of our water or drinks refilled while we ate.

I don&#39;t think we will be back here. There are many places for brunch and many other local businesses to try. I can overlook their plain decor but not their services and food quality. This place would have to make some major improvements for  me to come back here for a our next brunch date!"

Horrible hostess. Wouldn&#39;t let us sit at an open booth.  Put us right near the outside door and warned us that it would be chilly 
Food terrible.  We ordered sausage biscuits  There were 4 tiny pieces of sausage on the whole plate. Didn&#39;t order a plate of gravy. 
We also ordered a pecan waffle. It had pecans on the top but not on the inside as written on the menu.  It tasted like a powdered mix. 
The manager took off the sausage biscuits and made a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich  to go. Haven&#39;t tried it yet.  We&#39;ll see"

Yes!  This is the place for breakfast.  I find the Dutch pancake even better than Walker Brothers, but what really sets them apart is the burgers.  As crazy as that sounds the burger is outstanding.  The &#34;Big Daddy&#34; has everything from avocado, to &#39;shrooms, onions and cheddar. .and the quality of the beef is so good you should order it medium-rare.  Great service, family owned and tasty burgers. It&#39;s a must.  Their soups are also homemade and very tasty.  I have been coming here for nearly a decade now, I know this because it was our Sunday spot when my son was very young. He is 11 now and it&#39;s still one of our favorite places."

Food is decent to good depending on what you order. For example, the hash browns we had lacked salt, were undercooked and somewhat cold. The omelettes were pretty decent overall. Good portion size. Try their one omelette w/ dry figs, apples, Goat cheese and Pancetta. It has a French name. It was good. Their specialty Pancakes were tasty, not the best but good enough. Service was very good. Very good menu variety including the specials. It&#39;s reasonably priced. It gets pretty busy over the weekends. It&#39;s not Walker Bros, Richard Walker, etc type good of a breakfast/ brunch place, in my opinion, but still good enough to go every so often depending on how you like it. Check it out."

We stumbled upon this place. When we first walked in, you could smell apples and cinnamon. There was about a 10 minute wait. 

The line moved surprisingly fast considering the place was jam packed. The hostess was extremely friendly, and well organized as she sat down each group of people. Once we were seated, she informed us of who would be our server. About two minutes later our server came over and got our drink order. As we looked at the menu,  our coffee came. The coffee was delicious! 

I got the veggie crepe, and my boyfriend got the apple baked pancake. The waitress informed us that it would take 35-45 minutes for the pancake, in case we were in a hurry. That wasn&#39;t a problem for us, it was a Sunday fun day! The waitress made sure we had our coffees full while we waited. Our food came out and holy cow!! It was well worth the wait! The apple pancake was steaming and it melted in your mouth! The veggie crepe was very tasty! They actually used all fresh vegetables which is the way it should be. We have been to other &#34;brunch cafes&#34; who didn&#39;t and also didn&#39;t know how to season ANYTHING! (Btw this place is on lake street in Roselle, don&#39;t waste your time or money) 

We ended up taking half the pancake home, it&#39;s plenty to share. For the amazing service and high quality of food, we will most definitely be back and making this a regular spot!"

My first impression is this joint is a few steps above a Denny&#39;s but not quite a Blueberry Hill. For around noon on a Sunday, this place wasn&#39;t as busy as I had imagined. 

I wasn&#39;t quite sure what I was in the mood for. There wasn&#39;t anything that appealed to me on their breakfast menu, but I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted lunch. Luckily, one of their specials was the jambalaya. According to the menu, it was their housemade jambalaya (with Andouille sausage, chicken, and shrimp), layered over housemade hashbrowns with two cage free eggs, any style. I chose the eggs over easy with wheat toast rather than pancakes as my side. I was sad that my request for no shrimp couldn&#39;t be handled, as the the jambalaya is premade. I&#39;m not allergic, so it wouldn&#39;t be an issue to pick them out. Annoying, but it is what it is. 

It took a bit of time to receive our food, as there were fifteen of us. I expected such. Between placing our orders and receiving our food, our waiters and waitresses made sure we received plenty of coffee and water refills, which was nice. They give you real cream for your coffee, which is delicious. I&#39;m so used to drinking skim milk or using CoffeeMate, I&#39;ve forgotten what real cream tastes like. 

Our food arrived, and at first glance, the jambalaya portion seemed quite small. After picking out the shrimp, I dug in. The Andouille was a bit overcooked, but edible. The chicken was just okay; it was well cooked, good quality, but nothing spectactular. The rest of the jambalaya wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. The eggs were good, and the hashbrowns were decent as well. I ate about 75% of my food, but opted not to save my leftovers. 

Not a bad place to eat, but it&#39;s nowhere near my neck of the woods, so I doubt I&#39;ll be back."

The pancakes tasted awful like cardboard to be exact and sooooo dry i felt like I was eatting sand! You could literally chock if you have nothing to drink. The hash browns were so under cooked and tasteless and the services was worst! This was the first time eatting here and my last. The server was short with all her responds then the food was dropped off and she disappered. For it not to be busy and receive such poor service is bad. Definitely not a place I would recommend."

A few of us ordered a breakfast item with the steak and it was not cooked properly. I would say that they have the some of the best fresh orange juice. If you get something like a Belgium waffle you will be satisfied, but anything else seems to come out undercooked. I have gone a few times and i have had a similar experience at each visit.

The service there is also the type that makes a guest uncomfortable to come back as it seems the wait staff is trying to seat, feed and push people out as fast as possible. I rank this place with a below average rating because of the service being so pushy. This might be a primary reason of why the food comes out undercooked. I feel if they had a little bit more patience with cooking and treating their customers more like guest people really could enjoy this place more."

We waited for 50 minutes for this item and when we asked about our order the manager gave us a lot of attitude that our waitress should have informed us that it takes 20 minutes. The waitress did let us know about the time frame but it exceeded that and the manager was very rude to us. It&#39;s too bad the manager had such a rude attitude... won&#39;t hurry back here soon.

But places that serve them can be very hard to find, especially in Michigan, where I currently live. 

A few years ago, my son took my wife and me to Apple Villa on N. Barrington Road, and I knew I had found a special place. So now whenever we come this way and need breakfast, Apple Villa is where we go. 

Yesterday&#39;s 8-inch baked apple pancake was superbly prepared. It had a perfect amount of apple glaze covering the abundant amount of succulent tenderly cooked apples mixed in with just the right amount of delicious pancake batter. The best part of the pancake was that the glaze was cooked to a beautiful and scrumptious crunchiness, rather than a runny mess as I&#39;ve had at other places. 

But the excellent food doesn&#39;t stop at the apple pancake. The bacon I had was thick, and cooked to just the right amount of chewy crispiness. And my wife&#39;s ham portion was large and tasty.

Recently, I had an apple pancake at Richard Walker&#39;s Original Pancake House in downtown San Diego. I&#39;ve also had them at Original Pancake Houses and Walker Brothers restaurants in several states, including Illinois, Michigan, and Oregon. Of all of these recent experiences, the apple pancake at Apple Villa was by far the best.

The service was excellent as well. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. And the manager was very friendly and helpful. 

Thank you, Apple Villa, for allowing my taste buds to have such a supreme splurge of flavor. I can hardly wait to need to make another trip to this area!"

For those not familiar with that imagine a high class Denny&#39;s (ok, ok, picture a better Denny&#39;s).  We went during the week it was a very slow every afternoon, but they must get pretty busy on major food days because they had a sign with a &#34;waiting time from here not more than 15 minutes&#34; or something to that affect.

The menu has a good variety and being our first time here I decided to go with an omelette...pretty risque!  I also ordered a regular coffee.  The coffee refills were excellent and the server was very kind and helpful throughout the whole meal.  

I ordered the Al Fresco omelette and it was ok.  The main reason for being only ok was that about half of the avocado had turned which should have been caught in the kitchen.  I picked out the pieces of avocado that seemed a little too far gone and put them to one side of the plate, but the server didn&#39;t catch onto my subtle hint.  The pancakes on the side were very tasty and enjoyable.  I choose the hash browns on the side which were perfectly crispy for me.

I really enjoyed their regular coffee with free refills and the pancakes.  The omelette was where there could have done better in this case.  Overall a nice place to go for breakfast or brunch with a friendly staff that really seemed to enjoy working together."

Portions were ample. I appreciate the so-called small portions people keep complaining about; I ate enough and was full. I had no desire to eat a 6-egg omelette and take it home only for it to turn into rubber in the microwave. But I digress.

I ordered the goldie lox: an omelette made of &#34;smoked salmon&#34; (was really salmon from a can) , cream cheese,  cheddar cheese (really American), and of course scrambled eggs. The special included hash brown and pancakes. I opted for some chicken links too.

All in all, I enjoyed my meal. But it cost me $15 for all that when they were clearly cutting corners with the salmon and cheese. The dead giveaway about the salmon was fluorescent red--no fresh or frozen salmon looks like that. Apple Villa, please either lower your prices or raise your standards."

She was very attentive and friendly. Our issue was with the manager (couldn&#39;t see her name, older blonde lady). My boyfriend ordered eggs Benedict (they were fine) and I ordered the orange ricotta pancakes with Canberra compote. When the pancakes arrived the berries and sauce were dark brown. After tasting it, it had a strong resemblance of prunes. I asked our server if the berries were in fact cranberries and she said they could possibly be lingonberries and she was not too sure but she will find out. She was completely understanding of the situation. A few minutes later the manager came out holding my plate of pancakes and the first sentence she said in a very defensive tone was &#34;you don&#39;t like the topping?&#34; I was in disbelief how aggressive she was being about the situation. After I explained that they didn&#39;t taste how I expected she continued in her demeaning tone to tell us how we may be use to frozen cranberries but these are all fresh and organic. She then went on to say this is a special recipe the cook makes. I felt the entire interaction. the manager was attacking us and  was in defensive mode. She was extremely argumentative. After creating a scene in the restaurant holding up my pancakes like it was my fault I didn&#39;t like them she offered to make a new batch and asked if I&#39;d like any other compote or topping. I declined the topping and just asked for plain pancakes. I couldn&#39;t believe how she treated us, a simple &#34;I&#39;m sorry, we will make you another plate&#34; would have sufficed. Arguing and holding the pancakes in the middle of the restaurant was not needed. After that interaction me and my boyfriend decided to leave. We went to the hostess stand explained what had happened and then the manager walked up. She tries to apologize by blaming the server saying she was new. We already knew Lindsey was new and we had no issues with her. We let the manager know her attitude and demeanor was uncalled for and we will no longer be coming to their establishment. She then charged us for what we had. Seeing as we were walking out on breakfast (mind you I didn&#39;t eat much) I would have thought she would have comped something. She&#39;s a disrespectful manager and has a terrible attitude. We have been to that restaurant plenty of times and we refuse to refer any one there or go ourselves."

We were in a hurry, but thankfully, they were able to seat us within a few minutes. First of all, when my orange juice comes freshly squeezed, they get major points. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of the meal.

We didn&#39;t have time for an apple pancake, but I ordered the banana bread French toast. I got three square-shaped pieces of dark, thick homemade banana bread, covered with powdered sugar and surrounded by sliced bananas and pecans. 
The toast tasted pretty dry, I had to use a decent amount of butter to get it moist. More disappointing was that the bananas and pecans were served raw. I would have expected them to be caramelized in a pan to help bring all the flavors together.

 I did get a taste of my friend&#39;s cinnaswirl pancakes and enjoyed it very much. Maybe I just ordered the wrong item. I&#39;d probably give the place another chance, but I&#39;d definitely pass on their French toast.

It should be no wonder why this place is packed more often than not, the food is that good and the same can be said for their service staff! I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a &#34;breakfast guy&#34; but Apple Villa is my go to place when I have a craving for breakfast fare.

The only coffee I would place above Dunkin Donuts coffee would be theirs. I haven&#39;t had anything from their menu that I didn&#39;t like, and it only tastes better when it&#39;s my wife&#39;s turn to pay! Hahaha"

Takes nearly an hour for them to make it. This place is really over priced. Everything is a la carte so if you want pancakes, eggs and sausage you are gonna spend a bit. Not worth it imo.

It&#39;s your standard diner fare with a few &#34;specialties&#34; added in.

I had banana pancakes with pecans and it was rather bland. I am not a fan of syrup, so I usually get fruit infused pancakes because they tend to be sweet enough on their own or with whipped cream. But I was underwhelmed by the flavor, even with whipped cream added. And the texture was a little bit dry and uninteresting.

The sausage links were pretty good, though. Really thick and juicy. 

The wait was pretty long on a weekend, which is to be expected,but you&#39;re really crammed in by the door, held back by a line rope where there really shouldn&#39;t be one."

The hostess (which I think may have been the owner or related to the owner) was chomping on something as she seated us. Mouthful she spoke to us rudely. 

Two seconds of having been seated and handed our menus the waitress came over and asked if we were ready to order. I told her we were just seated so yes, we do need more time. 
Finally, we placed our order and the food was quickly brought out. I was impressed by how fast we got our meals. Too bad the meal sucked. We both had the ace of clubs aka turkey club sandwich. The bread was kinda stale and the bacon was obviously previously cooked and reheated...gross. 

The waitress never came over to check on us. The owner sat at a table near us and was on her cell phone the entire time. I actually heard the entire conversation about a credit card dispute. So unprofessional and annoying. 

Service sucked, food was blah and once I walked out I felt sick. Not coming here again."

A few weeks back, I met a few lady friends and their kiddos here for a mid-week breakfast. While I&#39;m sure Apple Villa is completely packed during the weekend breakfast/brunch hours, it was quite slow during the week. Score. If you have children in tow, this would be a fine place to take them - expect spacious tables and booths, high chairs, crayons, coloring sheets, etc. 

As we played with the kiddos and gabbed, our nice server took our order. I went with the strawberry crepes which turned out to be the epitome of a-ok. They were generous in size, light and stuffed with a fair portion of fresh strawberry. The crepe itself was adequate, if a bit chewy. Typically, said crepes come with a side of what Apple Villa deems &#34;tropical sauce.&#34; Said sauce was super saccharine sweet, so I decided to forgo the liquid topper and just snack on the crepes as in. Solid choice. If I ordered the crepes again I&#39;d probably ask for a side of strawberry puree...mmm, strawberry on strawberry. 

If you seek a clean, nicely laid out and spacious place for a solid breakfast, give Apple Villa a try - especially if you&#39;re dropping by during the week!"

apple-villa-hoffman-estates-2,Andrew G.,f3ccR72Y75lLAP88VLd8Tw,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,1,7,1206,VFAkqILKKhwRLgeMvFE8WA,4.0,2013-04-22,"The underlying issue with most breakfast places is that they have to compete with places like Denny&#39;s that offer relatively similar meals for a fraction of the price. Don&#39;t let that fool you with Apple Villa, as that is very much the case here as well, however the quality is noticeably better in comparison to most breakfast eateries. 

In the wake of a relatively long Saturday night, my fiance and I glanced through the Yelp app to make heads or tails of what breakfast food was within a ten minute drive amid brunch hours on a Sunday morning. It was either Denny&#39;s, IHOP or Apple Villa and on this morning, we decided on to give Apple Villa a shot. 

As we drove towards the diner, we called ahead to see what kind of wait to expect and was told there was none. Oddly enough, we imagined they were in-between rushes and upon arriving, got in several minutes ahead of a wave of hungry patrons. We were seated fast as we quickly ordered and were served two large glasses of orange juice. By the time they arrive, Apple Villa was packed again proving our suspicions correct.

The orange juice tasted significantly better than your typical Minute Maid flair peddled as freshly squeezed and I suspected was the genuine article. It was some of the best I&#39;d ever had at a restaurant and well worth the three successive glasses we each ordered throughout the course of our meal. 

As our waitress returned to take our order, she patiently answered ever last question about the little ins and outs of the menu before my fiance and I finally decided what we were going to eat. I opted for a cheese omelette, sold because of the pancakes on the side, and my fiance chose her favorite, eggs benedict. As the server left, we looked around the tables, taking in the sights of food as far as the eye could see. Every place setting looked packed with food.

Right before that magic moment when you wonder where exactly your food is, our server arrived and delivered our scrumptious breakfast. The eggs benedict were some of the finest we&#39;d ever seen, let alone tasted, and made me feel like I was a kid again sitting in my grandmother&#39;s kitchen on a Sunday morning. Cooked with such skill that the eggs dribbled perfectly, coagulating sumptuously with the ham and English muffin. I had to fight the urge to order some of my own.

The omelette was just as fantastic, loaded to the veritable brim with cheesiness so much so that it spilled out onto my plate as soon as my fork severed the first bite. I didn&#39;t even dare spoil the majesty of the dish with ketchup as I&#39;d typically do, instead savoring every last bite. I&#39;ve never had an omelette melt in my mouth before that day, but by Great Odin&#39;s Raven, it did and amazingly so. 

The sides were adequate, leaving each of us happily full and in need of being rolled home as each bite was its own particular brand of sleep-inducing delight. By the time the waitress brought our check, I was polishing off the last of our meal, struggling not to bring it home to sit idly in the refrigerator, lest it get seized by my dear fiance. 

Overall, the staff was immensely friendly and the food, while admittedly a bit pricey was well worth the cost of admission. Certainly enough, it&#39;s easy to walk into a Denny&#39;s or IHOP and get the same old thing day in and out without much surprise or spoil, but if those are places one goes to nurse a hangover then Apple Villa is one such locale to go and experience a well-crafted breakfast that you&#39;ll look fondly back upon when pouring yourself coffee and grabbing a doughnut come Monday morning back at the office."

The food is imaginative from the ingredients to the dish names, and it&#39;s equal parts tasty. One thing I vividly remember is portions being gigantic -- the pancakes were brought out on larger than average plates and still dropping off the edges! I came with friends and even dragged my family, half of whom aren&#39;t really American-style breakfast fanatics, and it was a hit all around.

I can&#39;t imagine this place dropping off so badly. After all, it&#39;s pancakes. How difficult can that be? (Yes, I know, we say that about pizza, and even that can be screwed up... but c&#39;mon!) I definitely will go back some day when it&#39;s convenient. I wish there was another one nearby!"

I don&#39;t understand the other reviews because my food was amazeballs only overshadowed by the stellar service we received!!

Thanks to freaking-United-Airlnes-and-their-&#34;Michelle&#39;s-mom-works-for-a-department-that-is-24/7-therefore-she-has-to-work-on-Christmas-Eve&#34; we decided to take our mom out to breakfast before her shift started at 3 pm.  My mom wanted to beat the crowds (just in case there were any) and we met on Christmas Eve at 7:30 with a group of four of us.

Parking was a breeze, and  the place was wide open (and busier as we left).  But we were seated immediately and were greeted by our waitress, Mary.  Let me just say, she was incredible!!!  She was friendly, sweet, fast, and my kids loved her.  Now I am not saying that&#39;s a sign of being a good waitress or anything, but they don&#39;t warm up that quickly to just anyone.  But anything we needed, she was there.  If we had a question, she had the answer.  Difficult order?  No problem for Mary!!

But we all got something different at the table.  I got the veggie egg white omelette with hash browns (upgraded to pumpkin pancakes for a slight upcharge), my dad got the Belgian Waffle, my mom got an omelette, too.  The kids got pancakes (the kids portion was massive!) and biscuits and gravy, and my husband ordered eggs, bacon, and pancakes.

Everyone who has mentioned how amazing the bacon is was absolutely correct!  So delicious!

My omelette was delightful, and the pumpkin pancakes were very flavorful (although I think my hash browns could have been cooked a little longer!).  The waffle was delicious, and the biscuits and gravy were SO good!  I loved the gravy that came with it, and I don&#39;t even LIKE gravy!!  Also, the biscuits have this &#34;crunch&#34; at the top like they were slightly fried--fine by me!!

Our total bill for the six of us came to $63, and three of us were able to make two meals out of it.  Not too shabby!

I cannot wait to come here again.  And if she is there, I will only sit in Mary&#39;s section! :)"

I ordered The Dutchess, a dutch pancakce filled with veggies including broccoli, onion, tomatoes, and mushrooms, and topped with loads of havarti cheese. This is a good choice if you are looking for something that isn&#39;t super sugary. The pancake is enormous; you&#39;ll almost certainly want to take some home. My cousin thought it didn&#39;t have enough mushrooms, but I&#39;m not a mushroom enthusiast, so it seemed fine to me. We arrived early (before noon) and didn&#39;t have to wait to be seated, but the pancakes take 30-40 minutes to prepare because they are made from scratch. We had a lot to catch up so the time passed quickly, and it was worth the wait. Service was otherwise prompt and attentive. I would recommend Apple Villa for a treat. They also have a regular sandwich menu for those not wanting pancakes or breakfast items. One note; you can buy pancakes frozen to heat up at home.

My boyfriend ordered the French Connection French toast - Cinnamon spiral bread dipped in French toast batter and topped with cinnamon apples, raisins and pecans. He also ordered a side of bacon and coffee.

I ordered the 2 eggs over easy with corned beef hash (made from scratch), hash brown potatos and a side of pancakes, Their coffee is delcious with some cream and sugar.

The waitress ignored my request for the pancakes to be flattened so they were served flluffy. I didn&#39;t complain. The fact they were chewy and stuck to the roof of my mouth made me consider the batter was meant for their specialities and not as a side dish."

Mind you, breakfast for us on a Sunday morning is really about 1:30 in the afternoon!  

To start, the coffee is the best - even better than Dunkin&#39; Donuts...and if you know me, then you know that DD coffee is like crack to me....cheap and highly addictive!

I usually get the veggie omelet with jalapeno cheese, pancakes with butter and syrup, and a fresh squeezed OJ.  I leave feeling like a whale, but it&#39;s so worth it!

There are two reasons that they only get four stars.  The first reason is that their menu is pretty much a carbon copy of Richard Walkers.  From the Dutch baby, the apple pancake, even the veggie pancake with havarti cheese...all ripped off!  The second reason is that the owner is kind of a douche.  He is an older man by the name of Kosta and he treats his waitstaff and busboys like they are beneath him and he has no issues yelling at them on the floor making it uncomfortable for everyone around.

First of all, it&#39;s clean, bright, spacious and contemporary - not in a cool, sleek sense, but in more of a sanitized, suburban sense. That&#39;s not always bad, and here it seems to work.

The other thing Apple Villa has going for it is the unique food. It&#39;s main menu falls into the classic breakfast restaurant trap of plain food cooked unexceptionally. However, their specials list was spectacular, and I had one of the more odd dishes I&#39;ve ever tried for breakfast. It was a fig, goat cheese, apples &amp; pancetta omelette that was all at once sweet, salty and savory. The figs did get overwhelming (it would&#39;ve been nice if they were cut up), but overall it was surprising and successful.

The hashbrowns....I&#39;m not sure where to even begin.  Half were white/raw, the other half were scorched/blackened.  They were uneaten on my plate and as I walked out I noticed the same on most diners plates.

If you are just sipping on your first cup of coffee and about to look for a breakfast place, then let me use more simple words: This place is the suck.

I went here two times in the last two months, and each time they failed to produce a decent breakfast. First meal: Taffy Apple Crepes which were cold, featuring half frozen apples and microwaved creps.  Second meal: Country Skillet which was served cold with raw potatoes.

Service is very hit or miss.

Prices are high, and the Hoffman Estates tax rate raises your overpriced icky meal into the &#34;big rip-off&#34; category.

I&#39;ve also tried their specialty pancake, &#34;The Dutchess&#34; which is mighty tasty.  It&#39;s a baked pancake with veggies and havarti cheese.  Quite delicious but you do have to wait about a half-hour for it to cook.

One downside is their regular pancakes.  I myself have not tried them but my husband is a big pancake fan and he doesn&#39;t like theirs.  Like in Kevin W&#39;s review - too heavy and wheaty tasting.

If you miss peak hours, look past the overdone interior, highish prices for breakfast, and inconvenient location, they at least had nice BIG sunny windows. OK, we are not really into foofoo breakfasts but we LIKE big booth windows, so we&#39;ll TRY it, but NOT meant to be...

We arrived about 1:30 on a Sunday (they close at 3:00). They don&#39;t look that busy, but busy enough for a slight wait for seating, I point &amp; request a booth by the window on the North Side  surrounded by other occupied tables to the 16-year old hostess who tells me they are closing that section down. I said &#34;ok then, we&#39;ll leave&#34;, and did.  

Pick ONE...
1. Improperly trained
2. They really don&#39;t care that YOU wait as long as THEY can start to vacuum earlier    and kick some dust into the air while you are still eating 
3. Inconsistent service. 

Intuit early, vote with your feet. READ the yelp reviews.

I only ever order the meat and potato type items since I&#39;m not a fan of sweet food in the morning or any other time of the day so I can&#39;t comment on how their pancakes or other sweeter items are. 

There is usually a line out the door at peak weekend morning hours which would be understandable if there weren&#39;t many other great choices in the immediate area. 

Nothing I&#39;ve had here really stands out but the quality is standard although the prices may be a little higher than standard. It&#39;s a breakfast joint for the masses that is way better than the next closest option down the street, IHOP.

I live closer to Richard Walker&#39;s now so I usually get my breakfast food cravings squashed there or other places further south.

Overall, decent but nothing to write home about."

We all ordered the eggs Benedict even though red velvet pancakes were on the menu.  I figured they couldn&#39;t be as good as the Bongo Room. 

Service was fast and the coffee was reasonable.  The bennys came out and the plate looked huge compared to the food on the plate. I&#39;m not saying I wasn&#39;t full but it made the meal look meager.  The verdict was the same for the bennys.  Good but we have all had better.  Not enough hollandaise sauce and the canadian bacon was too thick and chewy.  Like it says with the two star rating &#34;Meh, I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34; Much better. 

I won&#39;t be in this area very often any way but I&#39;ll pass."

They have plenty of variety on their menu and something for everybody even if you don&#39;t eat the usual breakfast meats and are looking for something egg-etarian. I usually get the 2 eggs with chicken sausages, toast and hash browns maybe, and I love it. Usually have to work out extra hard after eating here but its worth it anyway. :)

I&#39;d definitely pick this place over IHOP anyday. Even if I have to wait a few minutes. Parking is never an issue."

What was he thinking?!?!?  I know, he was thinking that Apple Villa has awesome food and it will be worth the wait.  Well, after waiting a bit over an hour and listening to him tell me about the Apple Villa Pancake, I was pretty excited to be seated. 

We were a party of seven and I acknowledge that we are a pretty needy group.  The waitress kept up pretty well until the Apple Villa Pancake Debacle.  We had a little of everything - red velvet pancakes, skillets, omelets, a burger, a chicken sandwich, etc and we were supposed to have the Apple Villa Pancake to share.  

The AVP didn&#39;t arrive with the rest of the food even though it had been almost an hour since we ordered the food.  We asked the waitress and she said that the kitchen was backed up, but it would be out in five minutes.  Five.  Ten.  Fifteen minutes.  Oh yes, it will be just a bit longer.  We waited almost another forty five minutes for this specialty item.  Sadness.  She brought the Dutch Baby for seven of us to split.  This is the smaller version of the Apple Villa Pancake that brought us from Carpentersville and Bartlett.  My parents were not happy.  After asking the waitress, we learned that to avoid overserving this delicious pancake, they automatically send out the baby version instead of the regular version.  She told us that we could buy a frozen version of the regular size to take home.  This makes no sense to me.  The items have different names:  Apple Villa Pancake vs. Dutch Baby.  The waitresses should ask if they don&#39;t know what the customer wants.  Bottom line - great food, lack of common sense, longest visit to Apple Villa ever."

Tasty poached egg  served on a warm toasted english muffin with a cushion of fresh spinach. Their Hollandaise sauce is really yummy! if you dont want too much of it, ask for it on the side or ask them to go easy on the sauce. I gobbled up the whole thing.

Also got a side of  peaches &amp; cottage cheese. While i wish they didn&#39;t charge $3 for this dish, they do give a good portion and a nice presentation of even this side dish. =)"

When I walked in, no one was in line and there where several tables and booths open.  I told the gal at the front I was a party of two.  She looked around, came back and said it would be a few minutes.  A family of four came in behind me and was seated immediately. Then, a group of three came in and they too were seated right away.  I was still waiting and there were still open tables.  I asked why people coming in after me were being seated before me and was told &#34;they have 3 people and we have a three persons table.&#34;  So, they were going to have us wait until a 2-person table became available.  All the time, there were open tables.  Unbelievable!  Needless to say wee left, went to another restaurant and were seated immediately at a 4-person table!

Last visit was on a Sunday morning, and they were busy.  However, my table was so sticky the waitress literally peeled the menus from the table. I&#39;m not one to raise a fuss in a restaurant, I was shocked she did not offer to have the table cleaned with the effort she used to get the menu off the table.  I was hoping my eggs and pancakes would be worth not touching the table.  Gordon Ramsay would have flipped out though. My eggs were raw, and undercooked, pancakes were underdone with no vanilla.  To make matters worse we never saw a waitress again.  We had to ask another waitress to please see to us getting a bill.  Really sad, as they used to have excellent food &amp; service.

Pancake (original) ***  too heavy and wheaty taste
Sausage (links) ***

I ordered the country skillet and it was delicious for a skillet, but not the best I&#39;ve ever had.  They did put lots of thick-cut bacon and ham in it which I enjoyed very much.  

I also enjoyed the regular pancakes very much.  I think I liked the &#34;wheaty taste&#34; that everybody is talking about.

My friend ordered the &#34;oatmeal pancakes&#34; (?).  It was on the &#34;specials&#34;.   It sounds strange, and the taste was OK.  Like oatmeal that was made into pancakes and cooked a little more on each side. Eh. Shrug."

When our order came out. well,  she got 2 out of the 3 orders correct. When I informed her that I did not order what she placed in front of me she quickly got defensive and said, &#34; that is what you order.&#34; She tried to show me what she wrote down on her ticket...... of course I was upset and told her that it was incorrect. She just stood there and stared at me as if she was using some sort of Jedi mind trick to convince me that what
 she placed in front of me was correct. ahahahahaha! She continued to be defensive everytme I merely asked a question.

The only downside to this place is their pricing -- a bit on the higher side. And the tables are a bit too close for comfort, but for a small place he able s hey seat you really fast and serve you quickly.

The food both times was sooo good. Both their sushi and dinner meals were fire. The prices overall wasn&#39;t too bad either, unlike other places I have gone for sushi. Got enough food to feed two for under or around $45. (At dinner prices too)

The sushi I would recommend is the avocado torch one and the hellboy I think. The steak meal that comes w stir fried veggies and rice was great, and their chicken katsu was good too!!! 

TLDR: Overall the food is great and so is the service. The last time I was here with my boyfriend we came around 5 o clock and they gave us a FREE ROLL!! It was their really popular avocado torch one. Excellent"

Not only is the sushi incredibly fresh, delicious, and inventive but their staff is also so great with children that it almost makes dinner out with little ones carefree. I said almost. 

The interior is clean and straightforward albeit on the small side. Thus, know that you may have to wait for a table if you pop by any time after 6pm. Back to the staff - they are so sweet and accommodating. When my husband and I bring the kiddos for a 5pm dinner they almost immediately bring out the kiddie cups and kid friendly plasticware to go along with the rushed edamame. One thing to note: no milk here. Hang with the H20!

For the kids (my kids are 17 months and 3 yrs), the chicken fried rice comes out in fresh, huge portions that leaves plenty for leftovers. For hubs and I, their specialty rolls and really any nigiri or sashimi have been perfection. Some faves include: tropical roll, white dragon, godzilla, hellboy. I typically ask for light rice on the rolls to really focus on the fish! 

I&#39;m so glad there&#39;s a local spot where I can piledrive fresh sushi while watching my kids enjoy a delicious meal on their own. Thanks for being so great, Sushi Ya. See you soon."

They use very fresh fish and you can taste the difference compared to other places right away. They also offer so many different varieties of rolls that everyone will have something to eat here. 

Also, Sushi Ya has the BEST agedashi tofu(appetizer) I have ever tried. I always order it If I go somewhere else and it&#39;s always super small, dry, and just not good enough. That being said, the proton sizes here are quite big and the prices are very accurate to the amount of food you get.

I always forget we get complimentary dining-in edamame and miso, and it&#39;s a pleasant surprise to remember.

The Avocado Torch is my absolute favorite, but if you&#39;re opting for healthier options, try the Four Seasons or sashimi lunch specials. Pair it with a sake and you&#39;re on your way to cozy."

The place is so small I felt like a sardine in a box, the seats are made for very tiny people. Can not accommodate a large group or even a nice size family. 

The restroom is in a very awkward location right next to dining room table. Awkward.

Waitress was not fluent in English and rather rude. She insisted on removing our dishes before we finished. Felt very rushed, hence the inadequate dining space. 

Won&#39;t be back."

    My husband and I were driving back 9 hours from a long car trip from visiting family and all we wanted was some light maki rolls for dinner to pick up on our way home which was close by.
     So we pick them up. I&#39;m thrilled especially after eating heavy holiday food. We get home, put our sweet son to bed, sit down and dig in. As soon as I pick up a roll I look into the Styrofoam container, there is A DEAD FLY UNDERNEATH MY MAKI ROLL. APPETITE GONE!! FINISHED!
     No use in calling, they are closed. So we won&#39;t be going back there."

Their food may be good but it is not worth the horrible service. After waiting 15 minutes a server finally came up to our table. We had to flag him down of course. I ordered a large Sapporo and was brought a small. Ok. No biggie! We ordered a sushi roll and two entrees. Sushi came out along with the edamame and soup. Ok. Getting better. Then our server brings us the check. We still had not received our entrees. He completely forgot to put the order in. We paid for the roll and left. Worst service I&#39;ve ever experienced.

It tastes fresh, never a sour fish! You know, sour, like those places where you almost can&#39;t eat a certain roll since it tastes like its gone bad? This place is the complete opposite, where everything tastes so good that you always want more! Even when you get full, you are still wondering if you can fit just one more bite in.

I had been losing hope in the suburbs for good sushi, but this place definitely impressed me with the good flavor and freshness of their food. They also bring complimentary miso soup and edamame when you sit down to eat. Nice touch. They have a very large selection of sushi, so there is something for everyone. I don&#39;t think I have had a bad roll here yet.

Another thing to note is that the sushi is so good that you can actually enjoy it without the &#39;wasabi&#39; slurry with soy sauce. The fish tastes good here, flavorful....you will not find that in many other places! You know you are having good sushi when you can enjoy it without the soy sauce completely! I will note though: the wasabi here is very good and fresh, you will get a very pleasant zing if you use it :)

Main complaints are that the location is just too small. You will almost always have to wait to be seated and it is super cramped with tables on top of each other. I have had to wait and hour or more to have food come out. Those are really my only complaints, the servers are nice, they feel bad about the waits, but there is nothing they can really do about it.

Good food, good service, most likely bad wait times."

-service is great, always greeted with a smile and the staff is very attentive, and food is prepared relatively fast even when the place is full
-every roll and piece of sushi I&#39;ve eaten here is fresh and presented well, especially with sushi it is an acquired taste but even if you are picky with you&#39;re sushi you will enjoy the food
-i haven&#39;t tried the dinner entrees (yet) but from everyone&#39;s reaction i can tell it is worth a try

We had a party of 5, 4 adults one one child. We ordered pretty much a little of everything. Everything we had was very good, not a single complaint about the food or service.

The total bill was a little over $100, which isn&#39;t bad at all.  The staff were all very polite and friendly. Being a smaller &#34;cozy&#34; place this would be a good date night destination, not so much for a big group of friends as you might feel a little claustrophobic."

Ever since our all time favorite sushi joint closed we&#39;ve struggled to find one to replace it. I mean how do you replace something so valuable? Well, Sushi Ya is slowly making it&#39;s way onto our favorite list. We&#39;ll definitely have to come back and give it a few more test drives, but on our first visit we hit gold. 

To sum up Sushi Ya it&#39;s a tiny gem in our treasure chest. It&#39;s small with a zen like demeanor, an atmosphere we enjoyed. We were greeted and seated and waited on and a bonus for me was my water glass was never empty (I drink a lot of water). Big kudos for the complimentary edamame and miso soup, I wish more restaurants would this, a cheap way of saying welcome and thank you.

We started off with the beef asparagus roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-ya-schaumburg?select=IQsHuGj2cok6-E6QuCexLg#2gbXHLbVBwf2PTXzhCLkhA) that was over cooked. Since the asparagus is wrap with such a thin slice of beef often times restaurants overcooked it and this time it was no difference. The sauce was decent, but we&#39;re big medium rare eaters so we would of taken the slice beef off the grill within 30 seconds, that&#39;s how thin it was. 

We ordered four rolls: Godzilla, white tuna crunch (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-ya-schaumburg?select=IQsHuGj2cok6-E6QuCexLg#X-iF6r-axIK_04t2VQNfpQ), Hell Boy and tuna tataki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-ya-schaumburg?select=IQsHuGj2cok6-E6QuCexLg#haMT9DywqkTeIvbERNwniQ). These rolls are gigantic! I enjoyed them all, although they kind of all blend in together because of the eel sauce they used on all the rolls. The Godzilla had just a bit too much rice and Hell Boy was my favorite with the mini scallops. They were heavy rolls so next time we&#39;ll balance it out more by ordering a few lighter ones.

My jean&#39;s button was already unbutton as I ate the last piece I could manage and I was happy. I haven&#39;t had good sushi in awhile and my better half felt the same way. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t eat out as much anymore so we haven&#39;t been back to Sushi Ya, but it&#39;s marked now so a re-visit is in the works."

I also had the Tropical roll. It was good, but the pieces were too big. I felt like a snake unhinging its jaw every time I ate a piece. 

Service is friendly and welcoming. Sushiya is small, with only 10 or so tables. It&#39;s a casual place, so not a place I would take someone if I were looking to impress or dazzle them, but for what they lack in ambience they make up for in delicious sushi."

Thank goodness we made reservation because this is a very small and cozy Japanese restaurant. Even when I made reservation we had to wait 10 minutes or so for couple tables to clear up. There were 6 of us, and we did end up getting a table. The staff is very kind and nice. 

For food, we thought the sushi was okay. I give this place a 3 stars but  my husband gives it 2 stars. We ordered many different rolls. These are really big rolls! Lots of tempura on top. We started with the chips and ceviche which was just okay. I had better at other sushi restaurants before. My friends ordered their chicken yikatori and they liked it. Also some veggie tempura. We also ordered one of their fireball appetizers but they said they couldn&#39;t make it for us because they were too busy. That&#39;s unfortunate. I wanted to try that! Miso soup is also free...thought it was a bit too bland for my liking. 

-Spicy scallop roll - this was decent. Their scallop roll was on par with other sushi restaurants. 
-Salmon avocado roll - this was good. Big chunks of salmon!
-Avocado fire roll - too big for my liking. Too much tempura crunch on top - didn&#39;t get to enjoy the fish much.
-Diablo roll - this was a good roll. I like the scallop on top!
-Godzilla roll, red dragon, and Hell Boy rolls are ginormous! My friends ordered them but we didn&#39;t try it. 

We also ordered their beef fried rice. This was pretty good! I like it more than couple of the rolls we ordered!

Overall, food is average. It is on the good end of sushi compared to other sushi restaurants. Good customer service - came around to fill our hot tea few times."

I called this morning and argued with 3 separate employees, and was told they didn&#39;t charge me twice, although the amount in my bank account and my statement says otherwise. They did not care to help or refund either of us, after arguing with them for 15 minutes over the phone, so I am now dealing with my bank to have charges reversed. Great customer service guys!!

I always get the Canada roll (baked salmon, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds) or the Ontario roll (same as Canada, with imitation crab), both of which are delicious and reasonably priced at just over $6 a roll.

However, I was pretty bummed out about my first visit there. Walking in on Friday around 6:00, the place seemed pretty busy. Which is a good sign for a strip mall sushi place. The place was maxed out at 40 ppl. I like this. Small and cozy. Looked like a neighborhood place for locals. Nonetheless we were sat in 5 minutes. The primary reason for the bad review is that they screwed up pretty bad without a genuine apology. The 2 of us repeated numerous times it was our first time there.  The great waiter ordered for us. Vegetarian roll for the wife. Avocado torch for me. She got her food in 15 minutes or so. Mine came out 20 minutes AFTER hers. The waiter claimed they save the best for last. Bro. Own up. Someone in the back fucked up. And honestly, the roll he claimed to be the best was a 7. Idk. Perhaps I was too pissed to enjoy it. 

The plus side. It wasn&#39;t that bad. The lady with the tea topped off our cup every few minutes. Even though I waved her off. Nice place to ppl watch. 

I will come back and give it another try though. I just can&#39;t excuse the fact that they screwed up major and did not own up. Plus they had the audacity to charge $1 for green tea. But in fairness I probably drank my share while waiting for an eternity for my ONE torch roll"

You know how some people have their sushi place and they sometimes wavier to test the waters at another sushi place, only to find none compare to their first choice? For a lot of people in Schaumburg, this is their first sushi choice. 

Each of the special rolls we ordered was better than what most places would offer and each had their own unique taste. 

They offered complementary edamame and miso soup with our meal which was nice. The miso soup was bare bones with scallion, very little chunks of tofu, and without seaweed, so take it for what it is.

My husband ordered an Asahi lager and it came in a big bottle (500ml/17oz) and served with a glass. It&#39;s Japan&#39;s #1 domestic sell, so it does have a generic, mass produced flavor to it, but overall I found it to be lighter and crisper than US domestic beer. 

Rolls ordered: White Dragon Roll, Godzilla Roll, Diablo Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll

Favorites (thus far): White Dragon Roll &amp; Diablo Roll

My only option was to sit at the bar and I felt that it took longer than it should have to grab a quick lunch - I was there around an hour.  

However, the food was fantastic.  Not really knowing anything about the food here I ordered two rolls and some pieces of sushi.  While usually that is perfect for me, here it was way too much food.  The rolls were great, I got the Fire Crunch Roll and another one that I don&#39;t remember - but it was good too.  They were both huge and I finished half of each roll.  I wished the waitress would have told me how much I was ordering, but it was my fault for not asking.  The fish was fresh and delicious and I would definitely come back."

Whenever I have a full hour for lunch (which is not very often), I always try to eat somewhere new. Sushi Ya has been on my to-do list for awhile. When I drove past it a few days ago, I did a quick turn into the parking lot as I knew that would be lunch for the day. An open parking spot near the door was waiting for me. Sweet.

I knew from previous reviews it was small, but I was still surprised at how small it was, especially at the &#39;bar.&#39; The place was pretty full, which was a good sign. An older lady motioned for me to sit at the bar and I was immediately handed a sheet of paper, pen, and menu without a word or smile. Um, OK. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do with the paper -- circle what I wanted? Write how many of the item I wanted? Make a paper airplane? Eat it?

I scanned over the menu -- so many delicious options! I wanted a small, inexpensive meal, so I selected the AAC sushi rolls. I wrote a &#39;one&#39; next to that item on the order sheet. While I sat there waiting, the guy/cook behind the counter eventually demanded the sheet of paper from me. If there is a way to demand something with your fingers, that is what he did. My order was demanded. Lovely. On top of that, he was confused by my order. The unsmiling lady came over, rolled her eyes at me, and highlighted the item I picked. Jeez. OK. 

To my delight, I was immediately given a bowl of miso soup and a small serving of edamame to start my meal. They were both yummy in my tummy! My sushi arrived quickly -- also very delicious. The highlight of my meal was the vanilla mochi ice cream I ordered. I love mochi ice cream and was very excited to see it here. The mochi I got was mango, not vanilla, but still did a happy dance in my mouth. The whole meal was just perfect for me -- perfect amount of food, perfect price, and perfect arrival on my table. I only paid about $7!!!

Oh, but after I put my debit card in the checkbook, the unsmiling lady snapped something at me. I couldn&#39;t understand what she was saying, and she kept repeating it to me with an annoyed look on her face. A couple that had recently sat down at the bar near me were trying not to look at our conversation, but they were, and I was starting to get embarrassed. I finally pointed to my ears and shrugged. She rolled her eyes again, grabbed a piece of paper, and wrote &#34;cash only under $10.&#34; OH. OK. I replaced the card with a $10 bill. When I got my change, I left a small tip and left as fast as I could.

A smiling lady did come up to me during all that and ask for my drink order (water). She was probably the only person in the place that made me feel like a valued customer. Everyone else made me feel like I was an annoying, unwelcome presence. I was not happy about that.

The food was good, but I&#39;m hesitant to come back because of the lackluster customer service. Perhaps it was just a bad day to be there..."

You prolly think I&#39;m kidding. I&#39;m not. Ok, I have no proof she was a Nazi, but she&#39;d make Hitler proud, none-the-less. Don&#39;t be flattered sushi Nazi- it&#39;s no compliment.

Having Nazi tendencies would usually drop my rating down to one star at best, but this was some good sushi. I&#39;m a novice, but even the sushi afficiandos with me agreed it was good sushi. 

We arrived around 11:45 and were seated right away, as there were very few patrons. We were served complimentary miso soup after placing our orders, of which there were an amazing number of options! I enjoyed the miso, and I&#39;m not usually a fan. And the shumai app for the table was also enjoyed. For our entrees, one of my friends and I shared the two rolls we had been eying, each at around $11 I believe. Again, being new to sushi, I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the tastes and textures were with the Diablo Maki and the Tataki Crunch Maki. These opened me up to a world of possibilities. I was also able to sample others entrees including the Philadelphia roll and I liked, if not loved, each one. What a great start!

During our dining experience, plates were promptly cleared and drinks refilled without having to ask. We lingered until about 1:30 as we were chatting and celebrating a birthday. The dining room got busier but not filled. We did not want to hold up a table so we were wrapping up, and making our individual trips to the ladies&#39; room, as there was just one. My fellow diners began to notice the sushi Nazi&#39;s dirty looks in our direction. We had already seen her freak out when another patron knocked over their lamp as they entered the tiny foyer. 

While wrapping up, the sushi Nazi came over to our table, forced herself between me and my neighbor, looked around at we four occupying the table, slammed her fist down on the table, and said in a brisk, quick and rough manner, &#34;OK! We will need this table now!&#34; At this point, I was turned on. I like it rough, what can I say? Haha JK, I do like to keep my audience riveted. ;) So, I just shot back, &#34;Yeah, we caught that from your dirty looks.&#34;

One of my friends was waiting for the rest room, just past a shade that divides the restroom hallway from the dining room. It was dark, so she didn&#39;t want to be hidden and startle the occupant of the rest room as they would emerge, so she pulled back the shade to allow some light in. Apparently, this was too much for the Nazi and she quickly snatched the shade closed in my friend&#39;s face! 

Now, we are reasonable people. We can understand if a table is needed. (Btw, there were other tables still available and we were clearly leaving anyway.) But there is such a thing as courteousness, and decorum, and the Nazi had none. I guess there aren&#39;t many that do. ;) Still, it soured what was otherwise a lovely experience for all of us. We were a party of 4, and 3 of us will not be returning, and those three wanted 1-3 stars at most due to the Nazi. It was pretty bad. Not bad enough to keep me away, but maybe that&#39;s cuz I snapped right back at her, so I had closure. My other 3 diners will not likely step foot in there again. 

So, as I said before, enter at your own risk. Good sushi, nice servers, good lunch specials during the week, but...mean sushi Nazi still at large."

Tuna Hulk Maki $5.95
-I always get this when I come here and it&#39;s filling at least for me.  I would definitely recommend the Tuna Hulk Maki.

I love Chicago maki $8.50
-My friend tried this and really enjoyed it.  The fried pieces in the maki stayed warm for a long time so you know they just fried it and it&#39;s fresh!

Customer Service has improved since I last came here.  It seems like the servers are different from the last time I came here.  They were attentive, but my friend did have to ask them a couple times to get her water refilled.

I would say this is one of my favorite sushi places in the suburbs.  The customer service is just ok, but the food is simply fresh and delicous which keeps me coming for more!"

It definitely ranks as one of the top sushi restaurants in my book among the burbs.  I&#39;ve been here multiple times, and fish quality is always nice and fresh - no weird mushy/fishy texture/smell/taste.

My husband and I showed up about half an hour before they were closing on a Friday night, and they took us in without any dirty looks (as you would get from some places where they were already cleaning up to close).  We ordered multiple nirgiri, your basic spicy tuna maki, and a hellboy special roll.  They do NOT skimp out on the ingredients here, as the rolls were fairly sizable - definitely worth it.  Prices were reasonable, especially taking into consideration the fact that the quality is very good.  If you love sushi, and you&#39;re tired of having to drive up to the city to fight traffic and struggle to search for street parking, you have to check this place out!"

However, I&#39;m not noticing any difference between nearly ANY sushi joint, so they&#39;ll all get 3-STAR ratings unless they go above and beyond.

Sushi Ya was literally no different from Sushi City (in Bolingbrook), so how can the ratings be better or worse for sushi if everyone does the same thing a la a fast food operation, albeit with fresh fish and a high-quality experience?

I thought they were fine and the free edamame was nice since others charge $4+ for it. In all honesty, you may as well spend $9 on a sushi tray at Whole Foods so you can skip a tip.

Regardless, some of the most inventive and nicely trimmed sushi I&#39;ve had is from Marianno&#39;s little in-house sushi hut in Palatine. The tempura shrimp sushi is the best I&#39;ve ever had and the GREAT older Asian feller&#39; (not the young teens occasionally on duty) adds like 5 extra items on top of the finished product. It looks gorgeous and tastes exceptional."

Good sushi place for beginners too. The sushi selection has not only many original to the restaurant makis but also selections for all raw and all cooked makis which I think is brilliant for those who are intimidated by the idea of sushi.

If the service has ever been slow or perhaps a forgotten soup they are more than willing to appease the situation with no awkward discomfort.

I&#39;ve tried many sushi spots and I would have to say that this is my favorite.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone on this since this place is packed everytime I come.  You may have to wait in line if you come during the dinner rush, but trust me, it&#39;s well worth the wait!
The food is delicious!  I always get the sashimi combo platter and the golden mussels appetizer.  My girl gets the alaskan roll and, sometimes, the spicy tuna or torch roll.  All of these are delicious.  The sashimi cuts are big and thick.  (The sashimi combo is based on whatever they have available so it may not be the same everytime.)  The golden mussels are baked with some type of delicious creamy topping and drizzled with a sweet soy sauce.  The sushi rolls are generously sized and tasty.  The fish don&#39;t have a fishy aroma, and seem to be fairly fresh.
The service is another positive for this place.  Each time I&#39;ve been here, the servers were always friendly and helpful.  Some of them may have a harder time communicating in English, but that&#39;s alright.  That adds to the character of this place.

As luck would have it, Daruma was closed for lunch on Sunday and I pulled up Yelp to show my mom how many great reviews Sushi Ya had since we were already in the area.  She was skeptical at first, but was sold on the restaurant by the end of the meal.

My mom loves her sake HOT, and always have to send it back at other places to get it hotter.  Not here!  She didn&#39;t even have to say anything, the sake was already at a perfect temperature when it came out.  Piping HOT!

My mom loves TONS of wasabi and this place scored 2 of 2 right off the bat.  TONS of wasabi served with the sashimi deluxe she ordered.  But then...she had to order a bowl of rice separately.  

Mom: &#34;It doesn&#39;t come with a bowl of rice like Daruma.&#34;  
Me: &#34;Yeah, but with the gas money you save from having to drive all the way to Daruma, you still come out ahead!&#34; 

YES!  I can&#39;t thank Sushi Ya enough for giving me an alternative (and closer) place to take my mom for sushi.  The sashimi was delightful and served on a heap of shredded radish.  We also received complimentary miso soup and edemame.  Hot tea, although not free, is only $0.50.  

The Fire Crunch roll everyone talked about did not disappoint.  The crunchiness came from the center as this roll was topped with a ball of tuna...fantastic!

The Soft Shell Crab appetizer was too heavy on the tempura coating.  I prefer the lightly coated soft shell crab style, so I won&#39;t be ordering this one again.

It used to be in the corner of a strip mall there and it was four times the size of this place.  Whether it&#39;s the same owners, and/or they have moved or not, it&#39;s still not good. 

It is also SO SMALL. It seriously has like 10 tables and a tiny sushi bar.  That&#39;s it. And it&#39;s always packed...which I just don&#39;t understand now that I&#39;ve tried the food. Last time we tried to dine here there were people literally crowding around the tables of people dining by the door and filing out of the restaurant because there is also NOWHERE to stand if they are full.  There&#39;s also no host stand so it&#39;s dog eat dog with the other crabby diners that are in there trying to get their sushi fix too.  I wasn&#39;t about to throw elbows last time so I just left and went to Daruma...which in retrospect was the best choice I ever made. 

Fast forward to this time...we got sat right away (it was around 7 on a Thursday night) and were given the biggest menus I&#39;ve ever seen at a sushi joint which I thought was a good sign.  (Turns out, it may have been a &#34;jack of all trades and master of none&#34; situation which I will get to.)  We also had a nice waitress but it seems like you can either have someone who hates your guts and doesn&#39;t hide their contempt for you or someone who adores you and your family and hugs and kisses you as you come in (I&#39;m guessing if you&#39;re a regular here they really treat you right) judging by the tables&#39; service around us.  Anyway, she was nice, but not very accurate.  We ALMOST got the wrong drinks (which my man took care of) and we did get the wrong order (which we didn&#39;t say anything about since it was only one roll off) even thought the waitress reviewed everything before she left our table.  We were served miso soup and edamame right away though which was pretty sweet considering I was about to go from zero to HANGRY in a few more minutes (my fault not theirs).  It was pretty much the only good part of the meal...  

On to the rolls.  BLECH.  I was excited because when she initially put the plate down I noticed that the rice to fish ratio looked good (I hate when there&#39;s tons of rice and a tiny dollop of fish in the middle) and some of the maki had decent sized chunks in them (spicy salmon and shrimp tempura crunch roll, I&#39;m looking at you).  BUT then I spied the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop and knew I was in for it.  Both were mashed up, covered in mayo, and sprinkled with some kind of red spice.  The spicy tuna was spicy, at least, but the spicy scallop?  BARF.  It was like eating fish-flavored, mayo-covered, chopped-up marshmallows.  AND it wasn&#39;t spicy either.  I put down all my rolls with a ton of wasabi like a big girl (minus two pieces of the scallop) and booked out of there vowing to never return.

I suppose if you only get the spicy salmon or some of their more fancy rolls, you might be alright.  They were cheap, and service was decent, but I sure as hell won&#39;t be returning just for those since there are better options that include good salmon and good service if you just keep on driving down Roselle Road.  Sorry, Sushi Ya."

Can&#39;t recommend the sushi, though. The sushsi was *very* sweet, I could tell they added sugar to the fish (or rice). I&#39;ve had plenty of sushi from other places, and NEVER before have I tasted sushi that was this sweet. Each of the 6 different sushi varieties I tried were overly sweet. This reminds me of how pizza places add extra sugar to dough when children order, just so they will be more likely to eat it. Won&#39;t be going back under my own volition any time soon."

Sushi Ya is a small restaurant located on a strip mall, but don&#39;t let that fool you into thinking anything less of it. There are roughly 10 tables in there so it can get busy quickly, but trust me, if you are lucky to have an open table then you are going to have some of the freshest sushi in all of Chicagoland.

Not only is the fish super fresh and the service super friendly, but the prices are great too! You definitely will not feel like you are overpaying, in fact after the quality you experience, you&#39;ll think you were under-billed.

Notably, their Sake Don is extremely fresh and is a generous serving size. Some of our favorite rolls there are: Fire Crunch, Spicy Scallop, Green Turtle, and Rainbow Dragon. Oh - and the complimentary miso soup and edamame are a nice touch too!

If you&#39;re in the area or shopping at Woodfield Mall, check out Sushi Ya, I promise you will not be disappointed!"

The food here is excellent and the prices are VERY reasonable for sushi. Of course, hot saki and large Sapporo&#39;s with good company make everything taste better :)

But, the food was very good....not the best I&#39;ve had, but probably better than 75% of the sushi places I&#39;ve been to in the city, so that&#39;s saying something.

 We had all rolls and I don&#39;t remember all the names of what we had. I know we had the Fire Crunch roll and the spicy tuna to name a couple.  There wasn&#39;t anything I tried that I didn&#39;t like. Our bill was about 85 bucks for the 3 of us. We must have had about 6-8 different rolls, an appetizer, a large saki and 4 large Saporros. That is a good price for what we got. 

Here&#39;s what I didn&#39;t like...and I see it now mentioned in other reviews. The staff is OVERLY attentive and distracting to the overall dining experience. There is such a thing in the restaurant industry called &#34;seamless service&#34;, and it is not practiced here at Sushi Ya.

 For example, I don&#39;t need to be asked if my plate needs to be cleared the second after a plate is emptied....just take the plate away. Same with water refills and the 3-4 different people who asked if everything was good....YES, if you see people eating food and tied up in conversation and you&#39;ve already done a check back to see if the food is to everyone&#39;s liking, then ya know what, EVEREYTHING IS FINE!!!

 After a while we felt annoyed and rushed a bit, and it was weird b/c we got there at 7 and left about 8:30, and the dining room is small but was half empty by the time we paid our bill. So, were they trying to rush us to turn the table and make more money? I think not, this is just the way they do things around here I suppose.

Please Sushi Ya, I want to come back when I&#39;m in the area. But the service aspect has to change a bit for me to do so. Other than that, thank you for the excellent sushi!!!!"

She had found a $9 off deal, so she thought that this would be a fine destination for a cheapskate like me and a freeloader like her to patronize.

The building that houses Mrs P and Me was constructed in or about 1902; so it&#39;s a really old example of local architecture.  It has served as a tavern, restaurant, and ice cream parlor over the generations.  It is now a retro sports bar.  It stands across the street of the Mt Prospect train station, so the kids can see the choo-choos pass by.

Although they make every effort to maintain the building, the wooden floor is warped, the HVAC system appears to be obsolescent, it is not handicap accessible, and most of the systems and architectural details are quite old.  My chair actually flexed back and forth while I was sitting at the table.

I am NOT suggesting that the building is in poor shape, because if you seek an old-fashioned tavern, this is the real McCoy.  Indeed, the place is charming and fun in its own way: the wood paneled walls are festooned with old photos of Mt Prospect, the nearby rail line, and old &#34;period&#34; photos of various stations along the train route.  They are fun to look at, and everything fits together in an authentic &#34;old fashioned&#34; manner.

We arrived at about 1 pm, and the place was bustling.  Lots of people were eating and drinking, while watching sporting events on their newfangled flat screen TV&#39;s.  Young adults as well as families were in attendance: even the Geezer and his young bride (who is nearing retirement).

We ordered sandwiches.  I had an alpine chicken sandwich (with mushrooms and Swiss cheese), and my spouse devoured a mushroom burger, which also had the same toppings.  Our waitress was friendly, but businesslike: she took our order and checked on us from time to time.  The quality of the food was pretty good, although you could definitely identify it as &#34;bar food.&#34;  (Let&#39;s be sure there is a space between the &#34;r&#34; and the &#34;f&#34; inside the quote marks.)

We enjoyed our meal and our experience there.  You might too.

BTW:  On the way out, I had a chance to chat with a local yokel who lives in Mount Prospect.  He never skied down Mount Prospect: in fact he denied that there was any ski hill in the community.  [See my review of Mt Prospect&#39;s Le Peep Restaurant.]"

All of the food definitely seemed like thawed stuff.  We also ordered cheese curds, which were pretty good.  For these three dishes (we only drank water) the bill was nearly $40.

My friend ordered the grecian chicken with mashed potatoes. This came with soup and salad.  He said the chicken was dry and the gravy on the potatoes tasted like catsup.

First off, the only reason we went here was because every other place in the area had over an hour wait. Maybe that should have been our first red flag. 

Our experience was very confusing. We had a party of 8. I understand that&#39;s larger than the average group. We got our drinks quickly but it took 25 minutes for the waitress to come back and take our appetizer orders (and refills). Another 25 minutes go by and our apps come out. They were all pretty good - buffalo chicken dip, spinach artichoke dip and pretzel bites. By the time our server came back our appetizers had already been gone for 10 minutes. She asked a bus boy to clear the table and left without taking our meal order. We waited another 15 minutes to order. Our food took well over an hour. The other 2 tables next to us with 6 people got their food first and we had been there 30 minutes longer than them. Aside from the fact of how dreadfully slow the service was, the food wasn&#39;t good. 

Other considerations: 
We asked for water 4 times over the course of 45 minutes before we got it. 
We asked for napkins and didn&#39;t get them at all. 
Our server overall seemed to be annoyed to wait on us.

Now I didn&#39;t say their website was wrong, but that the time was wrong when it was searched online.

A girlfriend and I have a weekly standing dinner date and have recently decided to start using up all of the groupons I&#39;ve purchased (seriously, it&#39;s an addiction.)  She takes the train from Mt. Prospect into the loop daily, so Mrs. P &amp; Me looked like a great place to meet for dinner.

The groupon was 2 beers or mixed drinks, 2 entrees, and a hot fudge brownie dessert.

Beer = Blue Moon on tap.  Thumbs up.  Would&#39;ve expected from a &#34;neighborhood bar&#34; that they might have a few more locally sourced beers (Two Brothers, Goose Island, etc.)

Food = The menu boasted a wide variety of bar options and entrees.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled great.  We decided to split the Ambassador Burger (bacon &amp; cheddar) and the Thursday night fish fry (cod).  The burger was huge, we could&#39;ve split it without the fish fry.  The french fries were also very good, and the coleslaw as well.  The fish fry was a little bit too salty for my taste.

Dessert = this hot fudge brownie thing was really REALLY good, but the whipped cream they put on it was weird... almost tasted like cool whip?  Not a fan of that.

Service = So unfortunate.  So disorganized.  So slow.  There were two servers on in the restaurant area, but it seemed that there was no rhyme or reason to their table sections.  The restaurant has two &#34;rooms&#34; and all of the patrons were crammed into one, I felt like the woman at the next table was sitting on top of me.

The fish is really good,  it&#39;s lightly breaded and the pieces of fish are big.  The coleslaw used to be really good but this time it was really bland.  For $8.95 and all you can eat, it is a good deal, but only if you can see your waitress again to order more!  A group of us that ride the train stopped tonight.  We had a table of 6. They put is in the back room in the corner.  We had 2 people that were delayed about 20 minutes so we ordered.  We waited forever for the food to come out.  We finished that plate and sat waiting again for the waitress to come over to see if we wanted more fish.  They bring 1 piece of fish for each of us.  We finish that and sit again!  The waitress never came back to see if we needed refills or anything.  A busboy asked if we were done since our plates are empty, we said no we would like more fish.  And again we wait.  Now all this time our waitress has come over to all the other tables several times and not once did she look over at our table so we couldn&#39;t even get her attention!!!  Finally after being there over an hour and we waved her over and asked for our check.  The two people that were late asked is they could get more fish.  She tells them I think we ran out but I will check.  How do you run out of fish when it&#39;s suppose to be all you can eat!! Another 15 minutes later she comes over with 2 pieces of fish and the check but she had all 6 people included on the check.  I guess the 2 people at our table that planned on staying were done since she closed the check!  Unbelievable!!  Worst waitress ever!!!  It should not take an hour and forty minutes to have dinner when it&#39;s fried fish!  Don&#39;t know if I will come back as we have to get back on the train to go to Cary!  When your dealing with the train schedule you don&#39;t have that kind of time to waste!  The later it gets the farther the trains are spaced out time wise!"

We live in the neighborhood and  have been to Mrs P and Me several times. Always found the food to be &#34;average&#34; and the service &#34;OK&#34;. But after last night&#39;s experience, we won&#39;t be back.

Let&#39;s start with the soup... My husband, kids and I ordered the cheddar broccoli soup. It was pure white, pasty and barely warm. The texture was that of Elmer&#39;s paste -- no exaggeration. It was inedible and sat untouched. 

Our meals came out next. My 7-year-old son ordered the kids&#39; cheeseburger. Not until he was almost finished did we notice that the inside was red and raw. Definitely not safe for a child to consume. We had asked for it to be cooked well done when ordering (yes, as his parents it was our job to check for doneness and we feel awful for not doing so). Their kitchen should know about food safety -- especially for items on the kids&#39; menu. We brought this to the attention of the &#34;manager&#34; who had a smirk on his face and an &#34;I could care less&#34; attitude. 

My husband and I ordered the chicken salad on avocado. The chicken salad was totally bland and the avocado was stringy and woody (not ripe/inedible). 

My daughter ordered the kids spaghetti which came with sauce resembling 100% tomato paste.

To add to our dissapointment, the waitress was never around. It took over 20 minutes for us to get our check after talking the manager. 

Lastly, the bathroom not clean and the hallway leading to the patio smelled like disinfectant and urine.

We won&#39;t EVER be back."

It&#39;s very lively and that&#39;s the best thing I can say about it. Also, it&#39;s probably one of the more &#34;upscale&#34; places in downtown Mt Prospect, but it&#39;s kind of got that...for lack of a better term...yuppie feel. The food is average, but the outdoor patio is ok on a nice day. The food is nothing to write home about, but some people I know go there for the food. Go figure.

Anyway, I was in there a week or so ago and ordered a vodka rocks and it was a bit light, and mentioned it to the bartender. She was very friendly and freshened it up. I thought, cool! Until the bill came and I saw that was charged for an extra drink. OK, I get it...I don&#39;t like it, but I get it...just let me know if you&#39;re charging me for another drink when you&#39;re responding to a comment about one that seems weak...especially when it&#39;s Absolute rocks."

It can draw quite the crowd, so plan accordingly. Kid friendly, even on weekends, though I would plan on eating a bit earlier to avoid the crowds.

So we heard this place had trivia from 8-10.  After eating elsewhere, we decided to check it out!  What a fun little place!

I was actually sad I had eaten elsewhere because there were a lot of things I wanted to try on the menu.  Next time for sure, then! :)

I ordered a margarita, and that was delicious.  The trivia was run by a lovely lady named Lara, and she was quite good at it!  I really liked her style!

They also had a really neat outdoor patio area that looked fun.  There were a lot of people out there this particular night, and I don&#39;t blame them--it was a gorgeous night for it!

It was close as we live in Des Plaines and I sometimes even get off at the Mt Prospect metra stop anyway.

We came in with no expectations.

I was initially a little put off by the distinctly bar-like atmosphere and might think twice about bringing young children here in the future but I reconsidered my thought process from restuarant to something more bar like for a place to go to for a sports game and meal in the future.  Still good.

The service was a tad slow in getting to us but nothing I can&#39;t deal with. Once out waitress did get to us she was nothing but pleasent and attentive. Ok great.

I wasn&#39;t expecting much from the food at this point but what we got was surprisingly tasty with fare you wouldnt nescessarily expect at a place like this. Both us got some sort of chicken sandwich and both were tender and juicy with great flavor. We both really enjoyed it and will probably be back soon"

The food was ok, the staff was ok, but for the life of me, where is that smell coming from? You notice it when you first walk in. It has a bathroom odor yet when I visited the men&#39;s room, I did not notice it coming from there. Could it be old wood? I know the place has been around for about 100 years. Perhaps that is the problem. But it is very noticeable and should be fixed. According to a few of my friends who eat there more often, this is a persistent problem."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are some good things here but I think it fell short.  It&#39;s authentic food and the atmosphere says it too.  The tamales are okay but have a good kick to them.

Carne asada is a hard one to get wrong but it was such a lack in flavor, spices.  So of course the taco de carne asada lacked good flavor.  If you want good tasting carne asada, you&#39;ve got to go next door.

The quesadilla is very good, especially al pastor.  Torta de Milanesa is good even though it was chicken instead of steak (see note from picture)

Plenty of other things you won&#39;t find in just any Mexican place so try some things out.  The agua de horchata and mango taste homemade so a plus for that!"

If you&#39;re looking for yet another taco joint keep going. If you are looking for something a bit different then you found the place.

They specialize in foods from the State of Oaxaca. You will not find tacos or burritos here.
You will find Tamales Oaxaca style ( wrapped in bannana leaves insted of corn leaves), tlacoyos, Pambazos, and memelas among other things.

This place is very genuine.  Will not say authentic as that is an overused and loosly qualified term.  If you want genuine food such as what you would find in any kitchen in Oaxaca, then this is the place to go.

The Pambazo is also very good. It is a torta with chorizo and potatoes and it is douced in a redish sauce.  Yum!"

Yay! The prices were also awesome.  My husband and I got three tamales, a sope, and two sodas for $15. They also brought house made chips and salsa to the table for free.

Tired of the spotty food quality at the taco joint next door, then head on over to this place. You won&#39;t be disappointed. The menu is small but it has a nice variety of things to choose from and even though tacos are not on the menu feel free to order of up set if you like. Great meat quality, tenderized perfectly so you don&#39;t get any fatty pieces. 

So far my personal favorites include the Quesadilla, which is different then your traditional Tex-Mex style, looks more like a Huarache, and the tamales that are wrapped in banana leaves. This place will definitely have you coming back for more. 

FYI: Not a Burrito Joint.... go for the Quesadilla if you want something similar."

In contrast to many reviewers, I really enjoy Bombay Chopsticks, that being said it&#39;s pretty pricey and the last couple of times I&#39;ve gone, the service has been awfully disappointing. Bamboo Garden was a refreshing experience as it was definitely fairly priced and service for the most part was good. We got a fairly new server who was not as adept to the menu to be able to answer questions about the food and speak on behalf of the preparation and sizing. Luckily my family knows the owner and we had her come over and explain, the food was great on that account. Back to our server, he never asked us how we would have liked our food prepared on a spice level and so we ended up with food a little bland for our liking. Next time we would say medium spicy to accommodate for that. Our nonalcoholic drinks were great - mango mojito and masala sodas. Owner was very kind and sent over a cake in celebration of my mom&#39;s birthday. Very nice touch. Overall pleasant ambience, food has great potential, prices are very fair. Would definitely recommend everyone to check it out. 

Opportunities for improvement: better trained servers to be able to speak to the menu, change seating arrangement of larger tables to allow for greater space between tables (people walking by next to the booths feel like they are completely in your space), warm water in the bathroom - please!!"

As for the food we tried a variety of objects but nothing hit the spot. 

The chilli shrimp had a nice flare of onion but lacked spice. The chicken dragons fire was pretty good and probably the best option for non-veg appetizers. It was cooked to perfection and they have a substantial amount of sauces at every table which provides a nice touch. 

The hakka noodles were bland and the noodles were tad chewy. I was not a big fan. The chilli chicken was solid and again perfectly cooked. The vegetable curry was bland and felt watery. 

Desert was interesting and I enjoyed it. We ordered the darsaan with vanilla ice cream which was unique and pleasant.

I&#39;ve tempered these thoughts by the fact that it was a fairly large group event. I&#39;m not sure, but it seems there were serving a good 75 eager and critical customers. ;-)

First, the welcome by the staff was good. We were guided to our tables, and shown the bar for our choice of beverage. The decor was tasteful and comfortable. Having an asian (Indian and Chinese - hence &#39;InChin&#39;) flair, there were Terracotta Warrior elements throughout.

The bar service was solid, if not stellar. Good interaction, but lacking swiftness. The drinks which came with our event were beer, wine and chosen mixed drink which I never got the name of. Basically, fresh blackberries, crushed with rum. Decent, but a bit chunky for a regular straw. Tasted like basic Bacardi (or similar) rum. Flavorful and refreshing, if not so easy to consume.

The food was interesting. We tried three appetizers and three main dishes, followed by one dessert.

Our first appetizer was Crispy Chili Baby Corn. it has a nice flavor, with sweet and spicy well balanced. The Shrimp Pepper Salt was made with nice sized shrimp sauteed with green chili and onion, and was medium in spice. The third appetizer was Ku Chow Chicken. This was billed as very spicy in their menu, with chicken, chili powder and spinach. The was the most monochromatic of our dishes, with only the flavor of the chili powder. Not exciting, and though indicated with a three star spicy rating on their menu, maybe just a 7/10 on the hot scale. Blah.

For our main dishes, we enjoyed Chicken Thai Curry, which was pretty good. A standard Thai curry dish, with a fair amount of spicy. Nice flavor and balance. Fish Creamy Chili Oil was OK. This was a creamy / cheesy sauce over tilapia pieces. Not bad flavor, just not particularly creative. It also was spicy, but not the three * spicy they bill in the menu.The Szechwan Chicken (I&#39;m guessing this is what this one was) was good, and also well balanced. A little salty, but not too bad. With these, we had bowls of each Burnt Garlic Chili rice and what I think was Hakka noodles. The rice was actually very good on its own, though fairly spicy. As a side for the other dishes, it didn&#39;t go particularly well. It especially clashed with both the tilapia and curry because of the differing seasonings.

Dessert was Darsaan with Vanilla Ice Cream. This was vanilla ice cream with fried noodles, sesame seeds and honey. I guess it was OK for what it was. Nice texture with the soft ice cream and crunchy noodles. I&#39;m just not much of a dessert person and may have chosen something different.

Overall, the food was decent, but the concept was very good. The prices seem expected to maybe a little high, but the creativity of the menu items would make this a fun place to visit. My rating, also, is based solely on the food and atmosphere since the service was for a large group event of perhaps 75+ people. Yes, it could have been faster, but considering how many people and tables we had, it&#39;s hard to give a good review. The attitude of the servers and passion for the concept of the manager and reps was infectious. I&#39;d definitely recommend visiting once to try something different and make your own decisions going forward. NOTE! Be prepared for dishes on the spicy side, and ask for less spice as they are able. They seem to be able to recommend dishes in this manner."

It&#39;s hard to describe what super spicy yet bland food tastes like - I guess kind of just like that lol. The baby corns appetizer was probably my favorite item. Szechuan chicken, white rice and the fish dish were so bland. I have no idea where the seasonings were in there at all. The veggies at least seemed really fresh in every dish.

AND THEN.....

There is Inchin Bamboo Garden @ Schaumburg, IL &amp; you can&#39;t help but feel hopeless at the lack of an option to give zero stars - maybe even negative!

We are big time lovers of the Indo Chinese variety of cuisine and have had meals on multiple occasions @ Bombay Chopsticks. This time we wanted to try a different place and chose Inchin. The fact that I had a lovely dining experience at their Raleigh, NC location also pushed me on.

It all started off well but the disaster unfolded as the food began to arrive, here&#39;s what we had:

Soup (Sweet Corn &amp; Manchow) - We asked for it to be spicy. The soup arrived, both were loaded with cilantro and FINELY CHOPPED RAW GREEN CHILLIES! Seriously? We spoke to our server about this only to be told &#34;This is how we do it&#34;. Dejected, we continued fishing out the chillies to be able to consume atleast some of the soup. 
Usually soup would be spiced with pepper or dry chilly flakes, no? So if &#39;This is the way you do it&#39; why not tell the customer at the time of order

Crispy Chilly Baby Corn - Average, not crispy as the name suggests but atleast we could eat it. Infact this was the best of this worst meal.

Drums of Heaven - Nothing but chicken wings, deep fried. I suppose it was to be well tossed in the garlic, bell pepper and onions but those seemed just plunked onto the centre of the plate. Very greasy and again very average. 
Am sure the Gods had a tough time digesting this one.

Burnt Garlic Chilly Fried Rice - The biggest disaster of them all. OH SOOOO OILY! At this point we called our server again who started off by reasoning that it was &#39;FRIED rice after all&#39; and eventually in turn called his manager. When we explained, he argued about how it was not oil but broth! (Do I look that dumb to you?)
He went onto use a spoon on hubbys plate, slide the rice aside and point things out. Totally rude! Finally after a lot of arguing he offered to make another plate. The manager came back in couple minutes with a Zero Oil Fried Rice, stood at our table and insisted we have it then &amp; there! He refused to leave till we ate in front of him. Clearly he refused to understand the point we were trying to put across.

Is it that difficult to accept that things have gone wrong and to just remake the dish properly? We left after paying the bill.

Never have I seen such attitude from restaurant staff and I hope I never do."

The environment is pleasant, it&#39;s comfy, the lighting isn&#39;t too intrusive or dim, the decorations are conversation pieces. At the event, we were able to try three appetizers, three entrees, two sides, and a dessert, as well as their upcoming potential new cocktails. First, the cocktails- my husband and I each got a different drink so we could try each other&#39;s and see which we liked. I ordered the Emperors Elixir, and he ordered the See No Evil (take a look at my pictures). We were warned the Elixir would be spicy, but I didn&#39;t realize until after trying all of the food items, this drink was the spiciest thing I had all night!!! It was definitely yummy, but all the red pepper flakes would punch me in the throat, so I couldn&#39;t enjoy it as much as I would have liked to. The See No Evil was delicious, but my husband quickly learned to remove the straw since the chunks of fresh berries would get caught in it. He said it was much more enjoyable without the straw, and I couldn&#39;t agree more. This drink was very refreshing! All of the appetizers we tried were delicious! My favorite was the baby corn. It wasn&#39;t too sweet, but had a nice kick to it with the sauce and spices. If I returned, I would definitely want to have that! When we received the entrees, they all looked amazing, but overall they were underwhelming- ESPECIALLY the seafood dish. It was just bland, which was heartbreaking because it looked unbelievable. I have to admit though, that I did thoroughly enjoy the curry with the coconut hint, pea pods, and broccoli. The rest of the entrees were really just eh, and not worth going out of my way or paying more than $10 for. The dessert was vanilla ice cream with honey glazed wonton strips and it was mouth watering, just completely delightful. The mix in textures paired with the different levels of sweetness was perfect. On another note though, we almost didn&#39;t receive our dessert though because the waiters forgot about our table! Which was in the middle of the room!! At least once I mentioned it to a waitress, she brought out another plate for our table right away, but the service throughout the night was definitely not the best. It took a long time in between courses for our next section and each time we needed more water, we would have to flag someone down. I can&#39;t imagine how awful it would have been if they were busier!! Overall, my husband and I agreed that if we were to return- skip the entrees! Go straight from appetizers to desserts and you won&#39;t regret it!"

I can see the seafood dishes being charged welll but really---gobi manchurian?? We love Indo-Chinese and go out for it often but if Inchin&#39;s wants to be the leader---a drop in prices will help. They had a cute Valentine special which was actually reasonable and we got to thoroughly enjoy a variety. So the stars are for the food and ample parking but the service being very slow, impersonal staff and high prices makes this a three star place.

To being with a snob at the reception - an irritatingly rude lady greets us with strong resentment for absolutely no reason (May be she got peanuts instead of her expectations of cashews for Valentine&#39;s day). 

But it doesn&#39;t just end there, food is to blame equally for this atrocious rating... sweet corn soup was too sugary and manchow soup was too salty..  appetizers were sweet (baby corn &amp; Chinese bhel)...It was sweet to the extent I thought they have hired a Gujarati chef.. After a good 30+ minute break we get a very mediocre main course -  Noodles were something I could have made slightly better myself.. only good part was the coin Manchurian but they screwed up the order there as well, lucky for us the manager was overlooking and he took care of it  eventually and fixed it (u won that 1 star man, it&#39;s all for that guy).

The food was excellent over here and the quantity is good as well for the price. The only thing that bothered me was the quantity of soup for the price. The quantity of soup was very little compared to the price. The soup was very good indeed but I felt that the quantity is too less. Rest of the appetizer n main course items quantity n quality price wise is really good. Loved the schezwan fried rice n garlic fish over here. I don&#39;t recall having this schezwan taste in us other than Bombay chopstick which is on the expensive side. Taste wise I should say bamboo gardens schezwan dishes are more on the spicy side and tastes better. Also loved the crispy chilli baby corn and chicken 65. Tasted their veg friedrice and vegetable red Thai curry and I should say they were great as well. I also liked the variety and option of sauces that were there on the table. If you feel like that the taste is not as you expected you have a option to sauce it up and bring it as per your expectation that&#39;s what I did with the veg hot n sour soup. The Tom youm soup was also really good. I would visit this place again n again the only request is that to increase the quantity of soup a bit its really less.

Only thing I didn&#39;t like and couldn&#39;t give 5*s is because of the service.. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the problem.. I didn&#39;t see servers falling short but for some reason they take hell lot of time to serve you or even take the order. They took almost ten mins to serve water. They are cordial though..

Staff was polite  and service was prompt. We got chicken corn soup and fiery dragon appetizer which was quite spicy but good. Wife liked her soup though serving was very small. Fried rice were a little too salty for our taste but not too bad.

We eventually canceled our order for the soup and the server or manager had no regrets. The main course all tasted the same. The hot garlic lamb was undercooked and sweet. Crispy potatoes for kids were just simple fries. The surprise cake was all goofed up by the server. She told the birthday girl that the cake is just coming and never brought a knife along with it to cut. Never coming back.

Terribly missed it when we first moved here but then we found another hidden Indo-Chinese gem in Downer&#39;s Grove - Taste Indian Chinese. 

We recently saw online that Inchin&#39;s opened a new location in Schaumburg so decided to try it out last weekend. I would rate it as follows:-

Ambience - 5 stars. Very ethnically done with lots of Buddhist elements. Kudos!

Food - 4 stars. We ordered the Veg Sweet Corn Soup which first came without any veggies but the manager was kind enough to give us an additional bowl with veggies, free of charge. Other items we ordered were - Lat Mai Paneer (yum yum yum), Veg Coins Manchurian (sauce was lacking something &amp; the coins were not crispy; would break easily) and Burnt Garlic Fried Rice (good!).
Service - 3 stars. Agreed, it&#39;s a new restaurant and they are still low on staff but we waited for more than 20min just for our check. Also, they have a rewards program but when I filled out the form &amp; handed it to the lady at the reception, she barely acknowledged it; not to mention she had such a morose face - be happy woman! ....so much for customer relations.
Price - 3 stars. Inchin&#39;s always has been on the expensive side but a dinner for 2 doesn&#39;t come less than $50 if you order soup, appetizer and entrée. 

Overall, it&#39;s a good place for special occasion dinners but I&#39;m still a bigger fan of Taste to date. Nothing can beat the &#39;taste&#39; and economical prices! Oh but Inchins is definitely better than the fake Indo-Chinese place Bombay Chopsticks!"

When you walk you are greeted to with a moist towelette and the owner is very friendly and frequently checks in to ask if your enjoying the food. Too tell you the truth this chain use to be favorite food chain and I was really sad when it permanently closed down in Chicago I had to bump down one star just for the frequent wrong food for the wrong people mess up but I am hoping this is just because they opened this new and I hope I can give then 5 stars next time.

The food was so medicore, the fried rice had no real taste the chicken was gawd awful and the manchow soup was filled with soy sauce and no chicken. I told them to take it back twice. The food is no where close to the other neighboring restaurants such as Bombay chopsticks, ha kah wok, hot wok.  They only thing which was nice was the restaurant it self.

Their staff members are quite nice and helpful. They encourage coupons and have even told me where to find them from time to time. The portions are large enough to share or make multiple meals off of if you will reheat Chinese food. I tend to find their dishes best the first time, so I&#39;m happy to share. Their prices are really reasonable compared to the other Chinese/Japanese/Sushi spot in town. I love the other spot, but my wallet can feel the difference.

They do a good job of combining the ease and quickness of a fast food restaurant with the comfort and service of a sit down restaurant.  I went at noon on a Thursday, and was met with a pretty substantial lunch crowd.  Despite the busyness, I was able to easily find a seat and my food arrived quickly.  One of the neat things they do is bring your food out to you.  Which makes this place feel less like fast food and more like a sit in diner.
     When it comes to burgers, I prefer to keep it simple.  As usual, I ordered a cheeseburger with ketchup, mustard, and pickle only, and a side of fries.  As a result, I&#39;m usually always satisfied and I feel like I can more accurately assess each burger using the same criteria.  
     Meatheads offered a pretty good burger, but at its price, it failed to make the grade.  If I&#39;m gonna pay almost 12 dollars for a burger, fries, and a soda, you&#39;ve got to do better than a good fast food burger.  Which is exactly what meatheads offered; they were better than McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, etc., but they failed to compete with the premium joints like five guys, portillo&#39;s, and culver&#39;s.
     Ps, if you&#39;re interested, my top &#34;fast food&#34; burger right now is five guys, followed closely by portillo&#39;s.  I make it a point to search out fast food burger joints, and I&#39;ve tried a pretty good amount.  In &amp; out is probably my least favorite."

There is a Coke Freestyle machine.  The staff is friendly.  The options are creative and you can &#34;build your own&#34; burger.

They will do a lettuce wrap instead of a bun which is great if you are doing gluten free.  However, I normally end up cutting everything up like a salad because the lettuce wrap is always positioned in a way that falls apart.  Everything tastes good and sometimes that is all that matters.

Normally I share fries with someone.  A small fry serves two and a large can serve 3 or 4.  The fries here are tasty fresh cut style.  You can get them regular or Cajun.  I normally do the regular fries...because they have Ketchupeno for dipping. I love Ketchupeno."

What this place really has going for it is the location.   It&#39;s one of the only quick serve restaurants in the whole shopping mall.   All the other restaurants are full serve and you would spend at least an hour there.

The place was crazy busy this night, but the workers were working their tails off to get people in and out.

The burgers were pretty good and I would say they were better than most of the other burger chains.

The first visit we sat indoors, and it was unremarkable, and a bit loud.  I remember sitting outside the second time, and the food is brought out to you.  The outdoor seating is on the little road, and has a view only of shops.  They have the Freestyle, so you can make one million different sodas.  But the food was not memorable for me.  Tasty enough.  But the competition in this sector is very tough.  There&#39;s now   Kuma&#39;s right nearby.  Portillo&#39;s owns the local sector on food that comes faster and is less expensive.  So where does this fit in?  Not as unique or costly as some, but they are approaching premium burger prices.  And for me, they need to step it up a bit with the food."

To best test a burger, I went for the basics: mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion on the 1/3 lb meathead, with cheddar cheese. I also ordered the chili cheese fries with chopped onions.

The food came out fairly quickly. The chili cheese fries featured fresh hand cut shoestring potatoes, with a mound of chili and a cheese sauce. I was disappointed with the cheese sauce, but the chili was pretty good. It was milder than I would have liked (I&#39;ve been living in Texas too long), but didn&#39;t have the cumin/chili powder excess some chilis have. 

The burger was, well, okay. Two thin patties with cheese and condiments on a plain bun. Nothing too exciting. Since the patties were thinner, there wasn&#39;t the juicy mess that corresponds to what one would think of a 1/3 lb patty. This was more of an imitation of an In-and-Out Double Double, without the melting cheese and greasy mess that makes the Double Double such an iconic burger. 

Although I like the optics of Meatheads, it isn&#39;t anything to go crazy over."

I would compare the place to the gourmet burger places that are so popular now.  I&#39;d rank this behind smash burger and five guys.  Their burger really reminded me of five guys but not quite as much flavor.  The fries were way behind five guys though so that makes the comparison much easier.

So after fighting for holiday parking at the streets of Woodfield, I saw the sign for Meatheads which seemed oddly appropriate considering my earlier purchases.    So I knew I had to check it out for lunch.

I decided to get the burger to go.    The decor definitely gave me a Smashburger / Five Guys vibe.    There was a small crowd in front of me.    I was pleasantly surprised to hear a customer request unsalted fries and the lady behind the counter complying.
I&#39;m not opposed to salt but hate how liberally it&#39;s applied to fries in general at any burger joint.

So when my time came up, I made the same request.   Since I ordered to go, I stood on the side with my number, which had the cool fact that only 8% of all U.S. beef can be classified as Angus.   I made a custom burger of honey mustard, pickles, grilled onions, and ketchup.    Pretty basic ingredients.

Customer service was very good from the lady taking my order to the one who delivered it to me.

The order took around ten minutes, which was fine.   The burger itself didn&#39;t really have any flavor to it.   I&#39;m assuming the condiments is where they expect the flavors to pop and perhaps I should&#39;ve ordered one of their limited custom burgers.   With that said it was an okay burger.    It is cool they offer a lettuce burger for the Adkins crowd.

The fries wound up being salted though which was a disappointment considering my request.    Maybe I might&#39;ve gotten residual salt from the trays itself, which if that&#39;s the case, definitely shows that they put way too much salt to begin with.   On the flip side, they give you plenty of fries so no complaints in that department."

The interior is very clean and casual; the first thing that caught my eye is a Coke Freestyle machine (hello, Strawberry Fanta Zero!).  My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of Coke Freestyle, so I made a mental note to recommend this place to him---after trying the food, of course.

I ordered a 1/2 pound burger with American cheese, regular fries, a side of Bistro sauce, and a soft drink.  My food came to my table pretty quickly; I probably waited about 8 minutes.  The fries were pretty tasty, especially with the Bistro sauce (which to me, tastes like a spicy thousand island dressing).  The burger was pretty good, but very greasy.  I mean, grease and condiments dripping off of the burger, down your arm, on the table.  Sometimes I enjoy a messy burger (today being one of those times), but beware for those who don&#39;t.

I did not order any milkshakes because I was stuffed.  But I definitely will next time!

My biggest disappointment was the Cajun Fries.  I didn&#39;t know the Cajun&#39;s were such fans of salt.  No real flavor, just salt.

$11 for the smaller burger, small fry and drink is overpriced."

This is probably the most important detail from my visit this week. I was in the area at lunchtime for a continuing education class. We were on day number two and I wanted something I hadn&#39;t tried before. A girlfriend suggested Meatheads and off we went. 

Parking at 12:15pm on a Thursday wasn&#39;t as bad as I would have imagined. There was no line and we quickly made some decisions. 1/3 burgers for both of us. Get toppings included some cheese and other things that aren&#39;t exactly up my alley. I went with bacon, grilled onions and BBQ sauce on the side. She tried the Cajun fries while I stuck with the regular ones. 

I tried the Coke Freestyle machine. It was cool. I was hoping for caffeine free regular Coke that I could turn into caffeine free cherry Coke, but alas there was no caffeine free regular Coke. Maybe someday Coca Cola will answer my plea...

We grabbed a corner booth and waited with our little order numbers. Both orders came out quickly. Hers was wrong. Her mayo was missing and I think the tomato didn&#39;t make the plate either. She mentioned it to me, but we were under a bit of a time constraint and so she ate it as is. She loved the Cajun fries!!  I tried a couple and thought they were pretty good too. My burger had a nice serving of bacon. But some of it was cooked perfectly and some of it was charred. I like crispy bacon. That&#39;s often how I order it. But this seemed like some pieces were scrapped off the bottom of the pan after being in there way too long. The grilled onions were not really grilled but rather just greasy onions. My regular fries were hot, nice and crispy and just very good. Neither or us were fans of the double patty of meat that seemed dry and under seasoned. 

A gal came by and asked how everything was but before we could say anything or even acknowledge her presence, she was gone. It was like she was meeting her quota of asking, but not waiting for a response. A manager in a dress shirt came by to ask the same question, but he was very nice and waited for the response. He also cleared our plates once we were done. I like a manager who gets out there and does what needs to be done. Someone who isn&#39;t afraid to get their hands dirty. 

If I&#39;m in the area, I might have some fries, try a shake or try their chicken next time. The burger just didn&#39;t do it for me."

BURGER - 3 - greasy as hell. this coming from a guy who says grease is healthy bc it helps us digest food. i consider something &#34;greasy&#34; when its dripping at a regular rate from the burger. its a shame since the burger was constructed really well too like at in-n-out

FRIES - 5 - can&#39;t really get any better than they do. hand cut it seemed. normal thickness, not shoestring but not steak fries either

CHICKEN TENDERS - 5 - again quite stellar and the batter/coating was extremely flavorful and just right. they use their own mix but its not some boring no flavor coating. very meaty and hot. 

ORDER: at counter

I&#39;m in Schaumburg from out of town (all the way from California), so I&#39;ve never been to a Meatheads ever. Are they a chain even? I&#39;m not entirely sure. Anyway, I walked up to the menu board completely unsure of what I was in the mood for. The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful in making suggestions, which I always appreciate. She asked a lot of great questions to really help us order what we really wanted (which ended up being a basket each of regular and cajun fries), and her menu knowledge was impeccable! But I think what really impressed me was her attention to detail when actually serving the food. She could have easily dropped it and never come back (which I wouldn&#39;t have held against her given the style of restaurant). Nevertheless, she came back around to check in and even offered to toss the nearly full basket of regular fries in the cajun seasoning after discovering the cajun basket was almost empty! Now THAT&#39;S five star service!

I do have to say that it tasted like all their ingredients were fresh, from their lettuce to their French fries. The French fries looked like they were freshly cut, nice and thin, but not too crispy where it would be like they kept them in the oil too long. I think they were seasoned perfectly.

I love their Texas Bacon Ranch burger, hold the onion. I&#39;m also amazed by their soda machine and the fact that I can get a cherry vanilla Mr. Pibb. My food always comes out fast although at my last visit my cajun fries seemed like they weren&#39;t fried all the way through and the centers were cold. Strange....

I was thinking that as I went to yet another gourmet burger chain (at least the third in the western suburbs). Meatheads competes with the likes of Tom and Eddies and Smashburger, and does a good job of it.

I had a Californian, while my wife had a Hawaiian burger. The Californian was quite good - you can never go wrong when an avocado is in your burger, even if sliced and falls out of the burger. The wasabi sauce gave it just a bit of heat, but more importantly made the burger not just taste like meat and avocadoes.

What I remember about my wife&#39;s Hawaiian was that the pineapple was marinated and tasty.

The fries were standard fare, so far as I remember; nothing to write home about. Perhaps I&#39;ll try the chili cheese fries next time."

My family went to legoland around the corner for my sons impromptu 3rd birthday and instead of paying $10 for a deli sandwich and a juice box we called meatheads to see if they were ok to bring our party there... Last minute. They totally accommodated us, even put out reserved signs for us. And even though we came in hours later, they welcomed us and helped us  steer all the kids in- having the little kids craft ready for them. As far as service goes, they seemed to genuinely enjoy that we were there and made our chaos feel welcome. They got the food out very quickly and put some assembly to us. 

As far as quality of food, de-licious! The burgers were well made. Easily comparable to five guys and smash burger. (Granted I&#39;m not a fan of either of those places for different reasons.) I love that they have integrity in the quality of food and give great suggestions for burger options. Chili Cheese fries would bring me back by themselves. The kids all finished all their food. The chicken tenders were so moist and flavorful, hot dog was huge. They even allowed us to bring in our own cake but provided everything else for us- including the lighter. 

When it comes down to it, price was good, food was great, service was exceptional. It&#39;s great to go to a place that is truly kid friendly but not a kids restaurant.."

These were some tasty fries that they had here, especially the Cajun fries. They were full of real potato flavor and the Cajun seasonings just added to it nicely, not overpowering. Texture, flavor, temperature of fries: pretty close to perfect.  I got the Californian burger and it was very good but I do wish that the patty itself was thicker (juiciness factor) so next time I will get a thicker burger. The cucumber was wasabi sauce on the sandwich was great and it was also good for dipping a couple fries. 

This location was the first one I&#39;ve ever been to and I will be back. For those that don&#39;t know, it&#39;s set up as counter where you place your order, they give you a number and then they bring it to your table. They were very speedy even on this busy Saturday during lunch time at such a busy location- and right next to Legoland!

I don&#39;t care much for ketchup (I know, very un-American) but next time I&#39;ll try the Ketchipotle. How cute! Oh, and the banana split shake sounded good, too!"

I was a bit apprehensive to try out this Streets of Woodfield goodie...and I don&#39;t really know why. Perhaps the opportunity for disappointment? Truth be told, my expectations were mediocre at best, but the two burgers I sampled exceeded those expectations. WIN. 

Meatheads is a pretty straightforward burger (and chicken and shakes and sides) bar. Order up at the counter, grab your number, snag your overly sugared Coke Freestyle machine made bevvie and have a seat. Hubs and I went halvsies on two specialty burgers: the Californian and the Hawaiian. What can I say...we were feeling coasty. 

Both burgers were equally as tasty - The California featuring avocado, pepperjack cheese and a fancy wasabi aioli. It had a perfectly delightful kick! The Hawaiian was stacked with jalapeno, pineapple and BBQ sauce. While I initially had a bit of trepidation wrapping my head around the pineapple/beef/jalapeno combination, it ended up rounding out the flavors quite well. Both burgers are certainly worth trying.

Size wise, these burgers were moderate - a nice weight for me but I think Todd W might have left a little hungry as we went sans sides. Also, worth noting that the burger itself is a bit pricey at $6+ each. Extra points for all natural burgers and no freezers, though. At least if I&#39;m wolfing down saturated fat it&#39;s all natural!"

They honestly have some of the best customer service of any fast food type of joint ever. Aside from bringing all of the food out for you, they bring anything you may have forgot. I asked for mayo (it&#39;s a white person thing, apparently) and bah bam! Brought to my table.

I paid $6.41 for a Lil Meatheads kid&#39;s meal. This is honestly a good size because you get a one patty burger, a good amount of fries and a tiny drink. Dining in, the tiny sized drink doesn&#39;t matter though because there are free refills! Yay! The cheese on my burger cost me an extra $1. :( I don&#39;t like being charged so much extra for cheese. Even 50 cents would seem more acceptable. But honestly that just means in the future I will not be getting cheese! I can&#39;t justify the extra dollar just for cheese!

My burger was the bomb diggy though as usual. That bacon ranch sauce is just awesome but I think I&#39;m going to try the bleu cheese next time since I won&#39;t be doing the cheese slices. The fries are also off the hook with a little sauce (you can get any of the sauces for your fries that you got for your burger). 

I always come during weekday lunches with my lunch crew and we have never encountered a crowd during the 11 to 12 hour. It may get busier later but we never have any issues with seating.

In the 5 Guys Vs. Meatheads, Meatheads still reigns supreme for me. I am not a big beef eater and I really love their burgers. I don&#39;t know what kind of buns they use but it&#39;s a bit different and it just adds to the yummy flavor."

I finally took the plunge and tried it out the other day. I would compare them to a SmashBurger or Five Guy&#39;s. It&#39;s a burger and fry joint that has chicken sandwiches and shakes as well. 

I decided to try the California Burger. It was juicy, dripping with pepper jack cheese, and topped with a wasabi sauce and avocado. It&#39;s better (by far) than a burger from McDonald&#39;s or Burger King. They are a little pricey (a little over $6 for a burger alone), but it is about what you would pay at a sit-down restaurant. You can take it to-go or stay in and eat. 

They have 2 types of fries as well - regular or cajun. The Cajun have just enough of a zing to keep in interesting, but they aren&#39;t too hot. ]

A good place to go for a juicy burger to satisfy your craving!"

So I bookmarked it for the future. Meatheads to me is like any other burger bar but alike those that range in the same market as Five Guys or the Counter. Per advertising; Meatheads boasts using fresh Angus beef (which is never frozen), fresh baked buns and fresh cut fries; they also make hand dipped milk shakes. 

One can compose their own burger with an array of options or choose from one of their specialty burgers. Some of their more interesting toppings: sauerkraut, jalapenos, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and pineapple! These are considered free toppings. Meatheads also offers a variety of sauces available upon request and which come atop their specialty burgers. Sauces which grasped my attention; cucumber wasabi and Thousand Island. On the side they offer a few different hot sauces and interesting ketchup / hot sauce concoctions most of us may have seen at our local grocers. 

Meat patties are thin and could be hand formed so if you are the average eater that often packs their meal to go, I would suggest going for a double. I chose the Cajun sunrise burger because it contained a fried egg, pepper jack cheese, jalapeno slices, bacon, blue cheese sauce, lettuce and tomato. It may sound like a lot, but with a single patty it isn&#39;t much when contained within buttered buns, we accompanied this feat with chili cheese fries. (Photos are uploaded) The chili and cheese went well together but were mild. The burger was built perfectly, but hardly satisfied my afternoon appetite. With drink I rounded out to about twelve and a half dollars. That&#39;s uber pricey for a burger bar. I could have done it cheaper by going with regular fries. All in all, pretty good stuff. But after having spent that much money and not feeling full, I left feeling disappointed. 

Service goes out of their way to make sure your visit is a happy one.  Meatheads is a chain whose beginnings started in Illinois and as of late has been spreading out up North.  What they have going for them is good leadership and one that&#39;s keeping a watchful eye on striving to keep things going well.  Kudos to the expanding business.  

Are they better than Five guys?  Not sure yet, have to try them again with double patty action.  Offering fried eggs and jalapenos has my attention."

After posting my review, I received an email from someone at Meatheads who showed genuine concern about some of my comments.  We decided to give it another chance.  This time, they came through with flying colors.

For fun, I ordered both a 1/3 lb burger and a foot long hot dog.  My wife also got a burger with fries.  I&#39;d been really craving a hot dog for some time and this was my chance.  They serve Vienna Beef all beef dogs. Like their hamburgers, you can get pretty much whatever you want on the dog.  Being from New Jersey originally, I like my hot dogs New York style - simply mustard and relish.  They grill their hot dogs on a flat top.  So much better than the boiled or steamed dogs at other places.  Also, they serve it on a New England split top bun - a nice change from the typical.

My hamburger was pretty loaded and very good - if I remember right - mustard, ketchup, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, red peppers, and jalapenos.   The fries are hand cut and crispy.  

One other point of note - their drink machines have many, many combinations.  For example, you can get Coca-Cola with vanilla, chocolate, cherry, lemon and several other flavors.  I believe you can do the same with other soda brands too.

Meatheads, you have redeemed yourself and I look forward to my next visit."

For example, I don&#39;t reflect back on my experience as either exceptional or atrocious. It was good, and I would go again, but I don&#39;t think I would make the trek to Schaumburg solely to have a Meathead burger.

I went with two friends and we each got different burgers. I got the Hawaiian burger, Cajun fries, and a featured milkshake. My two buddies only got burgers - no fries and no milkshake. I guess I&#39;m the piggie of the three of us. No matter - I&#39;ll still eat with pride and sparkle.

I digress. I was pleased that a short conversation at the counter helped me to get a kiddie sized Hawaiian burger (certainly more manageable for me). The burger came with a pineapple ring and lots of freshly sliced jalapenos. The patty was pretty thin. I hungrily ate most of my burger with the jalapenos and then had to scrape them off for the last two bites. They just got to be too much. My huger must have clouded my taste buds in the beginning. My Cajun fries were tasty and the shake was okay. My pals really didn&#39;t say too much about their burgers.

In regards to the atmosphere and the service: it was super casual. As I said before, we ordered at a counter and then our food was brought to our table. The tables were squeezed pretty tightly together and business was bustling. My friends liked the touchscreen pop dispenser. A manager (at least I assume it was the manager) came and checked on us. Other employees readily cleared our table as we finished.

I think that if I went to Shaumburg, that I&#39;d rather go to Smashburger over Meatheads. Maybe I&#39;ll convince my friends the next time I visit them."

They have chipotle and jalapeno ketchup which wasn&#39;t so great.

The fries are thicker than the shoestring fries at Smashburger but are kinda boring. They don&#39;t have an option for sweet potato fries.

Pricing is similar to Smashburger.

They don&#39;t have craft beers or any beers at all so that automatically gives Smashburger the advantage.

Parking SUCKS and is dangerous in the lots of Streets of Woodfield. 

&#34;Meh. I&#39;ve experienced better.&#34;"

I found them to be OK the first time, but quite messy. After returning, I think my opinion is slightly higher, but not by much. I don&#39;t think they are bad at all, just not as good as some other burger places in the area. It wasn&#39;t as messy this time, but we still had to be extra careful not to get sauce and juice on our clothing. My friend experienced the same trouble I had, though. Sauce was running down his hand and wrists. I don&#39;t think the bun holds up that well to all the condiments. You pick up the burger and the contents immediately begin to slide out.

This time the fries were better. We ordered the chili cheese fries. They were pretty good and my burger was decent. However, the most flavorful thing on it was the sliced onion. I came back excited to try the Bacon Ranch Sauce and was quite sad to find it lacked flavor. If you hadn&#39;t told me there was bacon in it then I&#39;d never have guessed. In fact, it didn&#39;t even taste that much like ranch. If you put a ton of toppings on my burger then I expect an explosion of flavor. I just didn&#39;t get that, but it was still a good burger.

I&#39;m going to have to stick with my original three star rating. I think the food is decent and the prices are pretty standard for mid-level gourmet grill. I just think that what I&#39;ve ordered seems like a fancy Wendy&#39;s. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Wendy&#39;s. They are probably the freshest/healthiest of the fast food burger places. This is definitely a step up from that. It&#39;s reliable. It hits the spot and I&#39;m not opposed to returning. It&#39;s conveniently located within the same shopping center as the AMC. Great for dinner and a movie among friends. But if I&#39;m spending $20+ for two burgers, a single side and a single drink then I&#39;d like a little more bang for my buck in the flavor department."

It is like a typical burger place like Epic Burger or so in which they give you a full list of condiments and veggies you want to put in your burger. However, I like Epic Burger more. The patties are thin and not that tasty. The grease went through the parchment paper.

This time around I went for their Chicken Sandwich and shared some fries with my fiance.  On my chicken sandwich, I added cucumber wasabi sauce, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce for free, and provolone cheese for $1 more.  The flavor combination was similar to the Californian but with chicken of course, a different cheese, some onions and no cucumber or avocado.  

What my new verdict?!?!  The sandwich was... okay!  Really, acceptable, from what I was expecting.  Each bite I was able to taste the toppings that I selected.  That was good.  As for the main component of the sandwich, the chicken, it was juicy, just the right size, but unfortunately just a tiny bit salty.  I wish they had an option for a different type bun, perhaps a pretzel bun, as it could soak all the juices and such.  It also probably could have balanced the said chicken too. But this instance might have been an off day.  It was alright, it didn&#39;t deter me from finishing it.  Just  happy their drinks are self-service aka refillable!

Anyway,  this visit I also discovered their different types of ketchup (habanero and chipotle).  Did they add to my fries/sandwich experience?  Slightly.  I enjoyed trying them and that&#39;s pretty much it.

A few aspects I enjoyed once again were their music choice, promptness of service, cleanliness, and chill atmosphere.

Overall, would I go here again? It wouldn&#39;t be my first choice, but its fine.  The quality is in between fast food drive-in places and a full dining service place like Friday&#39;s; but the prices are still in line with the Friday&#39;s side of the spectrum."

.
I usually get the 1/3 to 1/2lb meathead burger with cheese and most of the toppings, and usually add a fried egg for a little extra $.  (That fried eggs makes a world of difference).  Cajun Fries with a side of cheese.  I love the seasoning of the fries and how they come out hot and fresh. And I also enjoy the touch screen soda dispensers that allow a myriad of combinations (orange diet coke....... awesome, no more manually mixing orange Fanta and diet coke on my own!).

I can understand some of the reviews, if you are expecting the thickness of a Five Guys burger or a gourmet burger you might be a little let down.  But, again, from one burger lover to another, its consistently a DAMN good cheeseburger.

With the recent addition of Smashburger  and 5 Guys now we have Meatheads. Now I haven&#39;t tried Smashburger yet so ill hold back on really bashing any of them....yet. I will say this - this place serves a damn good burger and fries.

Unlike 5 Guys they execute the cooking of the burger better. Perfectly seasoned - unlike most places! Also the free toppings are a bonus. It sucks that you have to pay more for cheese and bacon but you can&#39;t win them all.

We got a couple burger obviously with some cajun fries. I like mine spicy so i opted for the jalapenos, mushrooms, grilled onions, and pepperjack. I would say that it would have worked better if the peppers were pickled and not fresh. The girlfriend got a more basic one with the bacon ranch sauce on it. Although it sounds good the bacon ranch lacked the punch to get through all the toppings and the burger itself. The highlight I think was the wasabi ranch that we got on the side to dip the fries in. 

So far the best execute burger from these new chains. I would choose this over 5 Guys for now not only for quality but also for the price - it was more affordable especially when your trying to grasp the idea your only getting a burger and fries. Oh yah and don&#39;t miss out on the wasabi ranch its killer."

Lots of options for their burgers.

There&#39;s the regular meathead, which is two patties; and the lil meathead, which is one patty.

Everything is made to order and delivered hot and fresh to your table. It was all very good. I wouldn&#39;t say the burger combinations themselves are unusual or novel, but the quality is very good. 

Service is always a big one for me, and Meathead delivers well. The cashiers kindly and patiently explained the menu and options to me, and the gentleman who delivered our food brought it with a smile, and the manager stopped by to see how we were doing and to ask if we needed anything else.

As other reviews have mentioned, this is pretty similar to Five Guys. It&#39;s sort of the Qdoba versus Chipotle debate -- Meatheads being the Qdoba. Same basic idea, a few more options.

The burgers come in three sizes: 1/4 lb (&#34;lil meathead&#34;), 1/3 lb, and 1/2 lb. They&#39;re thinner and griddled, with nice edges while still being juicy and just a wee bit pink in the middle. The fries are nice and crispy, a bit thinner than Five Guys&#39;, done just right.

There are a huge amount of toppings, including many cheeses, veggies galore, bacon, egg, and about seven different sauces. Most are free; cheese &amp; egg are $1, bacon is .75c, as is avocado. Fries come in regular and large -- a large is plenty for 2 people to share -- and cajun and regular. Good to know: they have cajun seasoning on the condiment bar if you want it on the side. They also have malt vinegar, hot sauce, A-1, etc.

While it&#39;s not dirt cheap, this is good food, considerably better than your average quickie burger joint, made with real ingredients -- a good value for the menu. We got a 1/4 lb and 1/3 lb burger, cheese and bacon on one, and a large fry - about $14 and we left full and happy. (P.S. To really save money? Drink water. Everyone knows soda&#39;s prices are jacked up.)

And just to ice the cake -- they have temporary cow tattoos! Which, I might add, has lasted over 12 hours now."

DON&#39;T EXPECT A SUPERSIZED BURGER FOR THE SUPERSIZED PRICE.
Been to a Steak N Shake recently? Well, imagine a burger with smaller patties then those, that cost twice as much. No, I&#39;m not kidding. 

DO EXPECT AWESOME FRIES.
The Cajun fries were to die for, much better than &#34;Five Guys&#34; Fries. And there were many of them!

DO EXPECT AWESOME SERVICE.
Their service was great. Friendly, approachable -- and they got my order right. Which, if you&#39;ve read any of my other reviews - you&#39;ll see I have many issues with ordering plain bacon cheeseburgers.

First, the atmosphere is nice. The restaurant is open, airy and has good karma. The staff is friendly and attentive.

I ordered a &#34;burger&#34; with only avocado (Mmmm!), lettuce, tomatoes and onions. It came divided into little triangles with toothpicks holding everything together. I really liked this as it made the burger easier to eat. It was nice to have a burger, without the meat patty, that&#39;s not just random ingredients slapped on 2 hamburger buns.

The ingredients tasted fresh. No wilting lettuce or mushy tomatoes. The bread wasn&#39;t stale or anything. So in all, it was a very tasty meal.

I also ordered a side of french fries. The fries come out on a huge plate and there was enough for all 4 of us on that one order. The fries were good. Not soggy. Not too salty. Not burned or overcooked. They could&#39;ve used a little more &#34;zest&#34; but nothing I&#39;m going to complain about.

Meatheads kinda reminds me of a mini Culvers. I like how you basically customize your own burger with the list of ingredients posted behind the cashier. 

My one big complaint about Meatheads is that it is pretty pricey for a burger joint - over $10 per person. The prices are preventing me from giving this place 5 stars.

I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go to Meatheads. It&#39;s not really a &#34;destination&#34; restaurant. Rather, if I&#39;m in an area and there&#39;s a Meatheads around, I&#39;d definitely go there.

P.S. I was here on a Saturday night. The entire Woodfield area was PACKED and parking was almost impossible. Just something to keep in mind."

I considered giving the place one  star, but the service here is super friendly. 

Apart from the stellar service, not much else can be described with such positive terms. The place is crowded, and although you get some cool burger customization choices and different sauces for your fries, that&#39;s where the fun ends. 

The burger has two thin patties and it&#39;s incredibly greasy; even more so with cheese. You really don&#39;t taste much apart from the napkin to wipe the grease off your lips....

My buddies split a large fry and sent it back because it was too salty. Honestly, when three guys under 30 complain about food being too salty, something is awry. My own fries weren&#39;t as bad as theirs, but still saline to the point I decided not to finish them for the sake of not developing heart disease that day. 

If someday I should return here, maybe I&#39;d have one of their &#34;famous&#34; hot dogs. Otherwise, their burgers (which are supposed to be their forte) are a giant fail."

Mighty Max - Ribeye, onions, and mozarella on a pretzel roll, squished to make it a grilled cheese.  It&#39;s supposed to have garlic butter but I didn&#39;t taste it. The cook on it all was good and so was the flavor but everything was super oily and lacked something that stood out.  For a $10 sandwich I expected it to be out of the park.

Fire Fries - You get a rectangular take out container full of fries (over cooked, my friends greek fries were charred).  They are covered in a spicy buffalo aioli (if you like buffalo sauce you may like this, if not it&#39;s a hard pass).  Then on top of that there&#39;s some bacon, not even spread out, and then liquid cheese. For a cheese place, you would think they would have melted real cheese not ball park cheese.

Service - it took over 10 minutes to get our food, then our one friend had to wait another 7 minutes and he was the 3rd of the 5 of us to order. Also they need to work on tray sizes. I had one sandwich and I got their big tray which was nuts cuz one friend had a sandwich and fries and got a small tray. 

They don&#39;t have free water.  You have to buy it for $2. Not cool, especially on super hot days like this summer heat wave we are in.

If you want a receipt, make sure to ask for it.

Probably won&#39;t go again, not unless they drop the prices on stuff 3 dollars on each item, then it&#39;s appropriately priced."

They&#39;ve opened up an actual restaurant a couple months ago so now I don&#39;t have to wait for the truck to pop up in my hood or stand in line for hours at a food truck fest.

They&#39;ve got a bunch of specialty grilled cheese you can order or if you don&#39;t like some of their combinations you can build your own.  However, if you&#39;d like to stick to the plain jane grilled cheese, they have that too.  My personal favorite, is the Great Dane.  Grilled cheese with American and Cheddar with applewood smoked bacon.  I like my sandwiches simpler.  I&#39;ve also tried the Chef&#39;s special with duck bacon, tomatoes and spinach and aioli.  While I did think it was a good sandwich, I felt there was too much going on.  My wife had a Nick and Randy&#39;s Eggcellent Adventure and while there was a lot going on with that grilled cheese too, I thought it was pretty good.

Fries are somewhat disappointing here.  they are fresh cut fries, but I didn&#39;t really care for them.  I&#39;ve tried the Rosemary, Greek and sweet potato fries and all were something that I felt could have been better.

Now probably the biggest issue I have with this place is price.  You can get the plain grilled cheese for $6.50... yikes, for a plain grilled cheese?  Probably the best deal is the Great Dane for $7 and it adds a bunch of bacon on it.  Every other specialty sandwich is $9.50 and up... double yikes.  Fries... are $4.  They don&#39;t have fountain drinks here, so all pop comes in bottles and I believe that is $2.  For lunch here where my wife and I split the fries, it ended up being $25.  So I&#39;d say price is probably what would keep people away from here, unfortunately.  It looks like they kept the prices from their mobile eatery here at the restaurant, but since the truck isn&#39;t coming to us, maybe the prices should be lowered here at the restaurant.

But hey, if you do have a grilled cheese craving, this place is where you need to go!  Prices are kinda steep for what this is, but you will get a very delicious sandwich and maybe just skip the fries to save on costs."

I can never go back to the way I was living my life before. How is it possible that a kitchen on wheels made my dreams come true? The Chef&#39;s Choice sandwich was truly life changing.

I seriously am speechless that I haven&#39;t tried this place before!!! I can&#39;t wait to go to the carry out restaurant location because I&#39;m going to need to get my fix every other week or so now!

I&#39;m Lovin&#39; the Food Truck concept.   They each offer their own spin on a meal that people like.  Well, who doesn&#39;t like the panini style sandwiches?? 

I tried Toasty Cheese 2 years ago by ordering a standard grilled cheese sandwich called Kim Classic--- it was cheesy &amp; good.    Now, fast forward to the present.   The building complex where I work decided to offer a different food trucks through out the week &amp; Toasty Cheese was one of them. 

I was thinking about ordering the Great Dane, the Chefs Choice or Mighty Max.  But I decided to try to &#34;build&#34; my own sandwich.  You can pick your bread style, cheese, sauce, protein, veggies else &amp;/or &#34;fun stuff.&#34;   So I went with Panini, chipotle chicken, spiced aioli &amp; spinach.  That is amazingly delicious.  Love-Love-Love.  

My other co-workers got different sandwiches &amp; they were all impressed on the flavors &amp; fresh ingredients.  

Another cool feature is that you can get the &#34;Lunch Special&#34; with some of the sandwiches. which would include half of a sandwich &amp; an order of fries.  Not a bad deal. 

Yes, the fries.   They are sooo good.  I have had their Classic Fries.   But they also have Rosemary Fries, Greek Fries or Sweet Potato Fries for $4.    

And it does not stop there.    They have soups, salads &amp; desserts.    They are an eating experience on wheels.   If you follow them on Facebook or other social media sites, you will know their whereabouts.   

You have got to check out this golden food truck."

A very well balanced sandwich.  We shared their delicious loaded fries with cheese sauce and bacon.

Others were raving about the duck bacon (Chef&#39;s Choice sandwich).  I will be sure to try it next!

The food is very  good and it&#39;s nice to see a place like this in Schaumburg. The last time I went I asked for a cup of water and the guy said they had no cups and had an attitude. I wrote the owner twice and he responded that they have no dedicated sink for water for customers but he said I gave his employee a hard time. Ouch. Not true at all. So I sent him a poem with plenty of cheese puns imploring him to provide tap water. He hasn&#39;t responded to my poem. It was G-rated, btw. My favorite line was about making my Gorgonzola a little less blue.
But anyway, the cheese puns wouldn&#39;t stop and so I wrote ANOTHER cheese poem. I&#39;m going to win him over with love, cheese and poetry. Enjoy.

Oh please kind sir
Please Brie reasonable
Free tap water for your patrons
Surely is feasible

The health department&#39;s rules
Cannot impede your (curds or) whey
H2O - gratis for all
And your customers will stay

You say it&#39;s a feta compli
French for done deal
But how can you deny us ice water
With our midday meal

I know this little poem
Cannot rise to Homer or Milton
Not epic, polemic, transformational
Just a simple lump of Stilton

But my hope is to sway
Us from this bottleneck
Into something smooth, French and delicious
Like a 6-week Pont l Eveque"

I went up to 4 instead of down to 3 solely because the staff was nice. The grilled cheese was good. I built my own as I didn&#39;t really see a good fun vegetarian option. Building your own is expensive. They should re-work the pricing. $3 for cheese...on a grilled cheese. That should be part of the base price. Just for a super standard sandwich without meat it cost about $8. Got cheese curds and they were extremely underwhelming. They were SO greasy and had a burnt taste, and the type of breading they use just doesn&#39;t really compliment the cheese well. It&#39;s a fun concept I just think they need to improve a bit."

I got the Great Dane and added their garlic avocado spread on it... AH-MAZING!!! It had American and cheddar cheese plus Applewood smoked bacon. So delicious!

The food..  The grilled cheese is huge.  They also give you a lot of fries when you o rder.  I ordered the ragin reagan as I love peppers with rosemary fries..

The sandwich was hot and spicy actually just perfect..    The peppers  could possible be sliced into smaller pieces so you taste more cheese thou not just all peppers.  As I ate more and more it just wasn&#39;t appealing anymore.     The grease became all you tasted and was just unappetizing ended up throwing more than half of it out.  

The rosemary fries were good..  Nice and crispy the taste was pretty good.  Can&#39;t really comment other than that.

This place specializes in amazing sandwiches, French fries...and this really amazing item known as the Hannah Banana. 
My girlfriend and I tried the Mad Max, the Big Bleu and the Greek Fries and Sweet Potato fries.

The Mad Max and Big Bleu were really cheesy and on a crispy roll. They were soooo good. They were also fairly similar in taste except the Bleu seemed to have a bit more variety in flavors. The Mad Max had more meat though.

The Greek Fries were amazing and I will definitely get more next time! The sweet potato fries were the freshest I&#39;ve ever had. They tasted freshly cut and cooked. Though I would suggest you get the Greek fries instead if you prefer taste over healthiness. 

And finally we tried the Hannah Banana. This thing was so crispy and creamy at the same time. Filled with marshmallows and Nutella it exploded with flavor. The crispness of the outer layer gave it an amazing texture. I literally ate the last bites of it slowly savoring each bite.

So in conclusion I truly recommend this place for an amazing lunch. Yes it is a bit expensive but totally worthwhile. Be sure to also look at their website since they travel around in a food truck. This truck will move around to different areas and they don&#39;t sit still for too long so it helps to know where they are so you can get some. Also be prepared to wait a bit since there was a line when we went."

I&#39;m glad you guys opened a store front. Very delicious but I do have to point out a few things. 

Offer some other classics like grilled ham and cheese. Maybe even turkey and cheese. 

Also, retrain staff on sanitation. The little girl working the front counter had taken a slice of the panini bread and was tossing it in the air, playing with it, without gloves, then put it back. She was bored, I get it, but that&#39;s not a way to kill time especially when you have an open, viewable kitchen and she handles cash at the register. 

Also, the cook wiped the sweat off his face with the same towel he uses to wipe his hands and counter with. 

All of these little things can lead to big disasters in the cross contamination area. 

Otherwise, keep up the good work but don&#39;t let the employees slack in these areas. 

I will still look forward to chasing your trucks or stopping by assuming you&#39;ll have addressed these issues."

Along with my grilled cheese, I got a side of the cheese curds. To start off with, the grilled cheese was definitely VERY cheesy, however it was so so extremely buttery and oily, and the bread almost seemed be slightly soggy from all the grease. I prefer my grilled cheeses to have a slight crispiness to it from being grilled. The cheese curds were even more disappointing. The place also doesn&#39;t have a water fountain for you to fill up a glass of water, so you have to pay almost $2 for a bottle of water. Between my friend and I, we paid about $30 for 2 grilled cheese, a side of cheese curds and 2 water bottles. For that price, I would rather go to Cheesies downtown - much better quality grilled cheeses. I hear the food truck is better than the actual restaurant, but for how I felt after eating only half my grilled cheese, I think I will pass."

I got the Ragin&#39; Regan and it was delicious (it&#39;s supposed to be spicy but I have a high tolerance for spiciness so I didn&#39;t taste much) and very filling.

These guys take the classic grilled cheese to a whole new level. So many inventive options to choose from. I immediately laid eyes on the chef&#39;s choice because it has duck bacon on it. Duck bacon people!

To complete this grilled cheese phenomenon the duck bacon was accompanied by provolone, fresh spinach and fresh baby arugula with Sicilian cherry tomatos and aïoli on a panini. Absolutely amazing. And huge! This is a big sandwich folks. You could definitely split it if you wanted to, but it&#39;s pretty delicious so...betta not.

The Chef&#39;s choice will run you $9.50 which sounds steep, but it&#39;s worth every penny. As a creature of habit I got this same sandwich both times which is my biggest regret. It&#39;s amazing but man is there a whole list of yummy options! Next time I&#39;ll have to branch out and try something new for sure.

Also... I read on their Facebook page recently that they now have cheese curds! #lifecomplete"

I was not disappointed.  When I think of food trucks, this is what I think of.  Quick, fast, efficient and tasty food!  Just standing there and smelling the food made the anticipation grow. 

The line was long, but it moved quickly.  They offer many types of cheese sandwiches with or without meat.  You can add ribeye steak, bacon, pork loin, beef patties, ham, chicken...etc to any sandwich.  The cheese selection is quite vast too, Mozzarella, Brie, Blue Cheese, Cheddar, American, Swiss, Gouda, Goat, Pepper Jack, Brie...etc.  You can order a signature sandwich or you can build your own. 

I went with the Great Dane.  It had American and Cheddar cheese with applewood smoked bacon on a panini.  Yes, I ate just one, but honestly, I could have had another one easily.  

If you like cheese, bacon, duck bacon, more cheese, more bacon, even more cheese, succulent bacon and juicy duck bacon, get on their website and find out where they will be and get some.  Prices are affordable for sure.  Most sandwiches are $5.00-$10.00 depending on how much meat you want."

My faves? The Greek fries (don&#39;t ask, just get &#39;em), the Great Dane sandwich with two kinds of oozy cheese and Applewood bacon, and the Lucky Luis Bites (perfect little dipping donuts). Now that they have an actual restaurant just a few blocks away, I may just have to become a regular."

Great bread, just enough beef and lots of melted cheese. The red onion added to the overall flavor. When i do this again I will go with the lunch special which is a half a sandwich and fries.
Just far enough away from my house to not make it a weekly lunch spot. But when in the Schaumburg area i will stop by.

We have had trouble getting to the food truck but the restaurant is fairly close to our house. So we have tried the entire menu now after several visits and tonight we designed our own sandwiches from scratch. My design w as good but they really know what they are doing there.
I am not sure which sandwich to recommend because really each one is a work of culinary art. The Ca$h Money is amazing. Pork Belly Shelly really surprised me with how tasty it was. Both great layers of flavor and combinations of texture. Ragin Regan was really excellent, until my mouth caught on fire. The carmelized onions, poblanos and jalepenos really pack some heat. You can go wrong with the Great Dane though. Fairly basic grilled cheese with bacon but elevated. My wife loves the Mighty Max and I can&#39;t blame her.

My last piece of advice; do not leave without a Hanna Banana, but have somebody to split it with."

I first discovered them a little over a year ago and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since. 

I mix up alot because they have so much good stuff! Can&#39;t go wrong with the Great Dane, Chef&#39;s Choice or the Mighty Max - all are awesome. Sometimes I like to just get duck bacon, cheese, onions and some arugula. 

The rosemary and loaded fries are good as well. 

It&#39;s gourmet grilled cheese with being pretentious but a sandwich and fries are going to be $10+ 

Check out their website to see if they&#39;re coming to place near you, otherwise you can find them near Firestone almost every Thursday.

That is what I was thinking as I was standing at a dinky table, pretty pissed off, and freezing my ass off at the Naperville Ale Fest. Then, the main reason I was excited to go to the Ale Fest came into view: Toasty Cheese. 

Let me tell you, it was the highlight of my afternoon. Four words: Ragin&#39; Reagan Raging Fries. Yes, yes, yes, oh hell yes. Both are spicy deliciousness in my cheese heaven. I was standing, at my dinky table, took my gloves off in 13 degree weather, and devoured the whole thing. People were asking me questions about what I was eating and my response consisted of, &#34;....erm...erm...*munch munch munch*....erm...uhmn....*crunch* *crunch.....*points to sandwich, shrugs shoulders*&#34; SO FREAKIN&#39; GOOD! I was going to take a picture of my grilled cheese, but instead I started shoveling it in my mouth when I saw the creamy gooiness of the cheese melting...couldn&#39;t help myself, sorry Yelp. 

As Danielle S. stated, &#34;How do you choose which grilled cheese you want?! I want them all.&#34; I too, wanted them all, and was almost willing to give up my calorie count to have them all; however, the fries and sandwich totally filled my gut up. 

Everyone I spoke to in the truck were super friendly, my food came out in a reasonable time, even with the crowd, they maintained a nice order. 

This was my first experience with a food truck, and I&#39;ve got to say, it&#39;ll be a hard act to follow. Thanks for making my experience at the Ale fest more tolerable, Toasty Cheese! I&#39;ll be stalking your website until we meet again."

The novelty of a food truck, the convenience of the suburbs, and the gluttony of varied and delicious MELTY CHEESES?! FAT KID PARADISE. How did I NOT know this was a thing before today?!?!

A bunch of my coworkers came back from lunch raving about some mystical food truck they&#39;d visited that was parked off Diehl Road somewhere. Being that you don&#39;t really hear about food trucks in Naperville, I was intrigued, yelped it, saw that all of my favorite Yelpers already knew and LOVED it, and stalked them on Facebook. I saw they&#39;d be at Solemn Oath Brewery, and off the hubs and I went.

I totally got lost trying to find this brewery - in the middle of an industrial park in the &#39;Ville, but we eventually found it and hurried up to order.

Now, my husband and I freaking love food, so excuse the fact that this order was for TWO people. We needed to sample. Here&#39;s what we got:

The Chef&#39;s Choice: who knew duck bacon was a thing?! Not I. Bacon is sort of a misnomer, as the texture is sort of Canadian bacon-y. If you can get past the weird texture, it is amazing. Accompanied by cherry tomatoes, spinach, arugula, and provolone, it was a gooey delight.

The Big Blue {with no onion, because ew}: I&#39;m a huge blue cheese fan and this did not disappoint. The meat was amazing and the pretzel roll was perfection.

The Rockin&#39; Rachel: husband wanted and LOVED this one. I could take or leave it - the PBJ felt greasy with the buttery bread sandwiching it.

The Mighty Max: husband wanted this, too. It was a big gooey mess in the wrapper, but again, he loved it, and inhaled it!

The Hannah Banana: SHUT. THE. EFF. UP. This is perhaps the most perfect and amazing thing I&#39;ve ever enjoyed - on a truck or otherwise. It&#39;s difficult to express how incredible this is. Banana purée, marshmallow fluff, and Nutella, all on panini bread, and DEEP FRIED. Delicious MELTY fried PERFECT. That&#39;s what this is. It sounds heavy and disgusting but it wasn&#39;t! It was weirdly light and almost sort of fresh tasting?! I feel like I could eat fifteen of these. I want another one right now, actually. The blend of ingredients, the crispy fried bread with the smooth warm Nutella... Ugh. Is it possible to fantasize about a sandwich?

We also got loaded fries, which were uncomplicated and tasty. 

Our whole bill for this mountain of food was like $40, and we have enough food leftover for approximately the rest of my life (which may have been significantly shortened by the amount of grilled cheese we just sampled). The truck was surprisingly quick, and despite ordering 5 sandwiches and fries, we were out of there in maybe 15 mins. We took the whole thing home to eat, but it seemed lots of people ate in the Solemn Oath - we&#39;ll have to come back and actually try the brewery at some point. But for now, my mind is adrift in melted cheese, gooey Nutella, a smattering of fresh breads, and an awesome new discovery in Toasty Cheese that we will be seeking out again in the VERY near future."

I really just wanted to try everything, at once, on a pretzel bun.

We decided not to alter the orders and just keep everything as is.

Let&#39;s start with The Great Dane. I&#39;m torn here because really it&#39;s just a grilled cheese. Don&#39;t get me wrong, a tasty grilled cheese, but a grilled cheese none the less. I don&#39;t think it would be my last meal. The bacon definitely added something extra. I&#39;m also afraid to know how much butter it&#39;s grilled in......eeeeeek

We also ordered the Nasty Naz. The grilled Jalepenos made it quite spicy with the cream cheese as a nice balance. It was a good thing I had a Solemn Oath beer to cool my mouth down. The bread on this one was toasted perfectly as well.

We didn&#39;t get any fries but the people we were with seemed to like them. We did, however, order the Hannah Banana. It was some of my favorite things on bread, then fried. Holy goodness. I could probably eat one a day so it&#39;s a good thing this truck is always on the run.

I can&#39;t wait to try the other things on their menu, and especially the breakfast!"

Ok, yes grilled cheese is good but it wasn&#39;t jaw dropping amazing. Or something I would order again.

Shortly after we showed up, the line really began to pile up. Their site does seem to have ordering online, but we didn&#39;t try that. 

I got the Great Dane (American and cheddar cheeses and bacon) and it was very tasty, though I could have gone for a little more crispiness. The brother got the Mighty Max (ribeye, mozarella, garlic butter, red onion on pretzel roll) and liked it, but definitely didn&#39;t love it as much as Chef&#39;s Choice. We also ordered a large loaded fries to share. I thought the fries were mediocre but the cheese and bacon topping was good; the brother didn&#39;t like the fries or topping.  The portion size was generous, and the sandwiches were so filling, large ended up being too much for the two of us. 

I would definitely check them out again!"

I&#39;ve been stalking Toasty on Facebook and Yelp for months, but I live so gosh darn far from Schaumburg so it&#39;s taken me a long time to finally try it. My opportunity came on Friday at Solemn Oath. 

I ordered the Jazzy Jeff because I have a love affair with olives and this sandwich has the muffalata salad on it. Overall, I thought this sandwich was good. The cheese was melty and the olive mix was divine against the turkey. I wish I would have went for the Chef&#39;s Choice because I&#39;m really curious about the duck bacon. My husband and I also ordered the Fire Fries to split. They were HUGE and way too spicy for my weak palette. It&#39;s weird because all the other menu items have stars on it to warn of the heat level, but the Fire Fries do not so I thought that I would be able to handle them. I ended up taking them home and putting sour cream on them and then they were in the right ballpark of spiciness for me.

I also got a bite of The Big Blue. I thought it was good, but mine was better of the two. All in all, I thought Toasty was good and I&#39;ll make it a point to hang out in Schaumburg so I can try more menu items."

Honestly their Chef&#39;s Choice panini with Duck Bacon is assembled and grilled to such perfection, your taste buds have a mouth-gasm.

Their awesomely friendly staff really cares about their customers and wants you to have a great experience!  They are not alouf and just want your money, and don&#39;t care about your experience... they may be in a food truck, but their service reaches beyond the sliding window... they are the best!

I have gotten the Chef&#39;s Choice panini twice now, and the 2nd time I even added the turkey, which was taking an insanely bombtastic sammich and turned it to a stellar sammich *IMO* 
(yes I know I&#39;m saying &#34;sammich&#34;)

I have tried their Sweet Potato Fries on the side, and absolutely looove them, especially with their homemade Wild Honey sauce!  I am one who is sensitive/weak when it comes to spicy, but this has such a fun &amp; zesty kick mixed with their organic honey, that I can&#39;t help but dip everything and anything in it!

Except for desserts, that would be weird...
But they DO have desserts now! OMG They have &#34;Chicago Cupcakes&#34; and the Red Velvet one was moistly delicious, holy cows, it was so good!  

My friend accidentally ordered the wrong cheese on her veggie panini (it comes automatically with goat cheese), and it was totally just her forgetting, not them messing up the order or by any fault, but she mentioned it and just asked if she could slap on a piece of the pepper-jack cheese she did want, and the cook was so kind, he actually ended up making her a COMPLETELY new sandwich, so she would have the right cheese! 

WHAT SUPERB customer service is THAT?! Wow, so generous!
They weren&#39;t in the wrong by any means, and they totally made her a 2nd brand new sandwich, so she gave me the original one because I LOVE me some goat cheese, and that panini was delicious TOO!

OF COURSE!

Everything that comes off this grill is amazing, if you were hesitating trying this gourmet food truck at all, don&#39;t.  

Honestly you have to give these guys a chance, your taste buds will thank you!

Yum, yum, seriously yum!

I&#39;ve only gotten the Chef&#39;s Choice sandwich at Toasty Cheese because I loved it so much the first time I had it.  My review is therefore going to be largely based on that sandwich. 

The Chef&#39;s Choice (a panini) is absolutely delicious.  Just read all the wonderful ingredients they pack into this bad boy: duck bacon, Provolone cheese, spinach, arugula, cherry tomatoes, all tied together with a delicious aioli.  The flavors are well-balanced and the texture is on point.  I&#39;ve also gotten the creamy tomato bisque, which is another standout. 

They do offer a lunch special with half a sandwich and a cup of soup, with the price depending on the kind of sandwich you get.  From a value standpoint, though, I recommend getting a full sandwich and a cup of soup.  You will pay more, but you get more bang for your buck.  (Shout out to my gf for her astute observation!)

The crew at Toasty Cheese is also top notch.  They&#39;re friendly, and on cold days, you can wait in your car and someone will bring your order to you.

Toasty Cheese comes highly recommended!"

This truck also works very fast - it took them under 1 minute to price and quote my complex configuration of several sandwiches and fire fries, and only a few minutes to prepare it all.

The assortment of sandwhiches I tried were all great: The raging regan had a good kick to it with the jalapenos and deliciously crispy panini bread. The duck bacon and rib-eye provide a good serving of meat that can be paired with a selection of 7 different sauces or 6 different breads (Russell bread is another interesting choice!). Although the name of the food truck is toasty cheese, the sandwiches are great  even without any cheese (although they have a great texture and flavor to them).

I hope this truck decides to return to Deerfield. It provides interesting sandwhich options that are typically found in the city but is rare in the suburbs.  The long line of eager foodies that happily waited in the freezing weather clearly demonstrated the high interest in their food."

So during my most recent visit, I commented about the duck bacon. This is an item that I&#39;ve never tried before. Without hesitation, a TC employee fried me up some fresh duck bacon and handed it over with some forks for me and my partners in crime to try. No joke...it is a crime that I have missed out on duck bacon up until now!  It was so good!

Another new-to-me item that day was the caramelized onions and jalapeños. This was not as successful according to the flames coming out of my mouth. If you like spicy, I&#39;d try this on your sandwich. It is apparent to me that I am not as much of a spicy freak as I may have thought that I was. 

I love building my own sandwich here!  I&#39;m picky and they have yet to disappoint. I always end up with exactly what I asked for and that&#39;s the way to keep me coming back for more!

My husband is hooked on Toasty Cheese too. He is such a bad influence!  Sharing a sandwich once with some coworkers now has them ordering regularly for the whole crew!  It&#39;s THAT good!

I&#39;ve gotta ask, but I think they rotate cupcakes/bakeries. I&#39;m curious about that as I do love my sweet treats!

Service is still spot on. They do an excellent job of keeping their followers in the loop on Facebook. If you haven&#39;t checked them out yet, you really should. You won&#39;t be sorry."

I love Toasty Cheese because they frequent various festivals and events in the &#39;burbs which is fun &amp; fantastic as we don&#39;t have food trucks in the suburbs like they do in the city. So to not only have a GOOD food truck in the suburbs but one that you can rely on seeing at any popular suburban event is just lovely. 

Toasty Cheese is a well oiled machine. They come well prepared to events usually never running out of items. They have enough staff to quickly take orders, make orders and hand them out. Yep that&#39;s right, orders are made on the truck, made to order. This well oiled machine will take your order, take your dinero and give you a number that they call when your food is ready. I love organization and this food truck excels in that arena. Not to mention, their website, facebook and twitter are constantly updated - another huge plus that many other food trucks don&#39;t keep up with.

Toasty Cheese was recently on Chicago&#39;s Best and I&#39;m really happy for them as I&#39;m hoping it drives up business even more &amp; the truck is here to stay! Because on top of being well organized and keeping their consumers well informed, the food is fantastic! My favorite is the Great Dane for $6. It&#39;s a fairly basic grilled cheese compared to the others on their menu with bacon &amp; two types of cheese on a perfectly grilled panini but it&#39;s so good!

If you haven&#39;t been to Toasty Cheese, go follow them on Twitter now! Stalk the truck and try them. Another Toasty Cheese food truck plus: They take credit cards!"

I&#39;ve tried more than half of the sandwich menu, and there&#39;s something special about each. If you&#39;re looking for classic, go with the Kim Classic (duh) or Great Dane (apple bacon makes it). Chef&#39;s Choice, or anything you add that fab duck bacon to, is truly yummy. And if it&#39;s heat you&#39;re looking for, you&#39;ve found it in the Ragin Regan- which pairs PERFECTLY with the Lucky Louis Bites, or Hannah Banana if you&#39;re really, really hungry.

OK, a diversion for desserts was inevitable...

Drool, don&#39;t get me started on the Hannah Banana; it&#39;s just amazing...rich, filling, and decadent, not to mention, cali-horrific, but oh so amazing. If you&#39;re watching your waistline- well, you&#39;re in the wrong place- but you can share the Lucky Louis with a little less guilt. Think scrumptious sugar donut holes. Yum, yum. I like it with the caramel or raspberry dipping sauces. Chocolate tastes like Hershey&#39;s IMO. Can&#39;t wait to try the Joy Joy sometime.

...and back to the savory. The Mighty Max at $7 is PILED HIGH with ribeye on a sturdy pretzel roll, so you are getting your tender, juicy money&#39;s worth for, that&#39;s for sure. All their ingredients are quality and fresh. Building your own sandwich has the potential to be fantastic, dangerous and expensive, relatively speaking. ;)

Anyway, there&#39;s clearly something for everyone, all grilled to cheesy, wonderful perfection for you to devour- and you will. I loved the rosemary fries, and I have yet to try the soups- how can I move past these sandwiches to sample its lesser cousin...soup?? And I love soup. These are first world problems, people, so find them and line up; it&#39;s worth the time, money, wait...and weight. ;)"

The simple grilled cheese is a standout on its own, but the wife and I got a couple of other sandwiches. And a boatload of fries.

My wife got an El Chingon with no pickle. I had a bite of it, but immediately decreed it &#34;pretty awesome&#34;. The pork was flavorful, tender! It went well with the sweet potato fries she ended up having it with.

The Kim Classic is where you can really see how well these sandwiches are made. The proportion of cheese to panini bread is ideal; roughly the equivalent of two slices of American Cheese, except, use good cheese. You can taste the butter on the outside of the panini. And you can see how the bread is toasted brown, and taste the crispy outside. It&#39;s a 5-star sandwich on its own.

I decided to go with a Scott&#39;s South of the Border. It&#39;s a cheese sandwich with pepper jack, chipotle chicken, poblanos and more. It was just a bit spicy, and nothing I&#39;ve ever eaten before. And it&#39;s assembled with all the care that goes into their classic.

The fries (sweet potato, Greek, *and* loaded) all come out on the &#34;softer&#34; end of the fry scale, with quite a few crispy bits interspersed. But they taste great and aren&#39;t flavors you&#39;ll find at other restaurants in town. I especially liked the honey and chipotle with the sweet potato.

The Toasty Cheese truck has a schedule on their website. If they&#39;re a town over, it&#39;s worth going over and standing in line for!"

At first I mis-read the name as Tasty Cheese and thought it was a cheese store.  What a poor choice for a name.  A grilled cheese sandwich and toasted cheese are two different things.  The store was very poorly designed and seemed to be part kitchen on the dining side with boxes stacked along the wall.  The girl making my sandwich seemed very new to cooking; she closed my sandwich before adding the bacon and had to pry it open again.  I found the sandwich to be too greasy and poorly made.  I also thought the place seemed way over priced for the food and the atmosphere. I notice if you wanted a sandwich, fries, and a drink you could easily spend just short of $20 per person.  Wow, that&#39;s a lot for a stand in line kind of place.  All I could think of while waiting for my lunch was, &#34;What would Marcus Limonis do with this place?&#34;"

I keep hearing about it, seeing it on Yelp, and wondering how a food truck with grilled cheese sandwiches could be THAT good. Um...let me tell you. This grilled cheese blew my mind.

First off, how do you even choose which grilled cheese you want?! I want them all. They have so many unique ingredients all piled into one sandwich. We ended up going with the Chef&#39;s Choice...how can you turn down duck bacon? It was amazing. Just the right amount of ingredients, served hot, and the sandwich is HUGE. I&#39;m really glad I split it with someone. It was definitely worth the $9. After we were done, we were already planning what we would order the next time!

It did take a while to get the sandwich (but it was also at the Food Truck Extravaganza, so that could have something to do with it). However, totally worth it. Toasty Cheese...we will meet again!"

My husband and I ordered the Great Dane which is a basic grilled cheese with bacon, and the &#39;spicy&#39; fries, which come with nacho cheese, aioli sauce, and bacon pieces. The guy that took our order was extremely friendly and it didn&#39;t take long for us to get our food. Maybe ten minutes after we had ordered. 

The grilled cheese was a grilled cheese. Although it was good, it was nothing special. I really regret not ordering one of their other specialty sandwiches so that I could give them a proper review (I will be updating this one once I have tried more of their sandwiches, promise). The fries were great. If you want spicy, these will satisfy your craving. They are just hot enough to make you want to keep eating more and not stop, like those damn Tabasco cheez-its. 

I thought the price for the grilled cheese was way too much. I could understanding charging more for the other specialty sandwiches that come with hot peppers, cream cheese, or fresh tomatoes, etc. but not a basic grilled cheese sandwich. The fries were 6 bucks, but that was well worth it because it came in a huge Styrofoam box and could feed four people easily. Heidi K. brings up a good point...they are more expensive because they have to pay for fuel of course. It&#39;s a food truck. Makes sense.

It also looked like they had cupcakes and a dessert sandwich, which my friend ordered. This thing had hazelnut spread, fluff, bananas, and it was deep fried. I tried a bite, and that was more then enough. I couldn&#39;t imagine eating the whole thing. Not a chance. 

Again, I think I need to eat there a few more times to give a proper review on this place, but for now this will do."

I have to admit, I was a little more than excited. Sadly, my expectations weren&#39;t completely met. Please don&#39;t get me wrong, the sandwich itself was delicious. I had the Mighty Max and it didn&#39;t disappoint. Filled with ooey, gooey mozarella cheese, steak, onions, and garlic butter all on a super soft pretzel roll - how could you go wrong with that? The $9.00 price tag was a bit steep, but I&#39;m willing to pay it for a great sandwich. Was it worth it? I&#39;ve had bigger and better sandwiches for $9.00 from nicer, sit-down establishments. I would say $6.00-$7.00 would be a more fair price tag for a sandwich of this caliper. Anyway, moving on... I think my biggest disappointment was the wait time. I had four people in front of me waiting for their sandwiches, and I waited 23 (yes, I counted) minutes for my sandwich. That is just way too long for me and my self-diagnosed Adult ADD to handle.

Overall, I say Toasty Cheese is A-OK. Super tasty sandwich, steep price, super long wait, friendly staff."

Of course I had to try it and so I did on two different occasions and also invited them to come to my company which was a success!! The employees loved the idea, the food, and customer service.

Food:
Mighty Max ($7): the sandwich is big, delicious, and filling + more.. I love how the meat is cooked medium rare (?) ..so if you need it cooked well done, make sure to let them know in advance..it has a lot of flavor due to all the options that you can put into the sandwich..onions always create some type of flavor!....after getting the sandwich, I was too eager to eat that I missed taking a picture of the food!! :( ..oh wells next time!
Contains: Grass-fed rib eye, Mozzarella, red onion and garlic butter on a pretzel roll

The Great Dane ($5): the food was good....it&#39;s been awhile since I tried it so I can&#39;t exactly remember.. I&#39;ll have to try it again!
Contains: American and Cheddar cheese with Applewood smoked bacon on panini bread

The Hannah Banana ($5): a few words that come to mind when i think about the sandwich is sweet, heart attack, delicious...the sandwich is huge so it is ideal to share with 1 or 2 ppl...definitely too much for one person to eat on their own....after my friend &amp; I saw the sandwich that we were sharing.. we basically said to ourselves... i think we&#39;re done eating for the day.....shocked at the size..I would definitely recommend you try it if you haven&#39;t tried it before....

Greek Fries ($3): the first time I tried it..it was delicious..2nd time i tried it ..it wasn&#39;t as good...but possibly because others were saying that they didn&#39;t like it as much..hm..still good tho! depends on if you like the seasoning

Sweet Potato Fries (~$3?): delicious, but if you don&#39;t like honey, ask for it without the honey.. it says drizzled with honey, but sometimes there&#39;s quite a bit of honey...possibly helpful if you have a sore throat and need some honey while eating fries...:)..the fries will probably taste good even w/out the honey....

Wait time: expect a wait of about 6-10 minutes depending on what your order and how many people are there..

Customer Service: all the workers there are very friendly..

Love how their food comes in cute to-go boxes that look like boxes for cupcakes. :)

I would like to try some of their other sandwiches as well!.. I&#39;ll be back for more!"

Because I had a South of the Boarder and Greek fries on Friday night.. and its all I&#39;ve been thinking about! 

Lets break this down.. CHEESE! Really is there any more to say? 
Okay fine.. These sandwiches are PACKED with yummy cheese on amazing bread with extras inside. You can pick one off the menu of build your own. We tried the El Chnigon and the South of the Boarder and an order of amazing Greek fries (feta, oregano, and lemon topped some fresh cut fries). Everything was amazing. The Chingon was a little greasy and hard to eat, we couldn&#39;t walk while doing so for sure.. but that&#39;s alright, I&#39;m more than happy to take a seat and eat these! 

I was lucky enough to try them (after a year of day dreaming and drooling over pictures) at a food truck event on Friday night. 

The only down side is I work in Rosemont a 9-5.. so the likely hood of me getting them anytime soon is slim.. but the next even I will be there Toasty.. Don&#39;t you dare try and hind from me!"

Customer Service: 1/5 stars
Overall Experience: 2/5 stars

Let me preface this review by stating that my two-star rating was chosen due to pretty bad service during my experience visiting the food truck today. I have never visited the restaurant location in Schaumburg, so please only consider my review if you are thinking of paying the food truck a visit. 

With that said, I have also been a Toasty Cheese food truck customer on about five or six separate occasions over the last few years. I first discovered the truck when they used to park in the Container Store parking lot in Schaumburg and I have also found them on occasion at festivals or local events. Keep in mind that it&#39;s a food truck: limited space and limited resources available to the staff to get the job done. You also have to consider that the truck usually shows up for events with a large crowd, or they show up in the parking lot of a large corporate office during peak lunch hours, so you can reasonably assume to wait in line for at least 5-10 minutes to place your order, and then wait another 5-10 minutes for your food to be prepared and made to order. Grilled cheese sandwiches aren&#39;t like burgers, chicken tenders, etc. because you can&#39;t pre-make them and let them sit under a heat lamp (with all the gourmet ingredients) and still expect the sandwich to taste pretty good. If Toasty Cheese used that model then I sure as heck wouldn&#39;t be paying $9.50 for two pieces of bread and a couple slices of cheese.

For the most part my experiences are pretty consistent when it comes to the product. The food has always been exceptional: great flavors, fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection. I am a huge fan of the Pork Belly Shelly and you can&#39;t go wrong with the Great Dane. I am honestly not crazy about their french fries because they don&#39;t have that crunchy consistency I prefer. The sandwiches are pretty filling so I recommend sharing french fries with another person if you want to give them a try because you&#39;ll feel pretty stuffed. For what you get, the pricing is spot on. They don&#39;t skimp and the ingredients are high quality (no Kraft cheese singles found here). It&#39;s a little pricey for a sandwich, but also very well justified. 

The service... that&#39;s another story. Like I said before, you cant expect to receive a gourmet, made-to-order grilled cheese sandwich from a small food truck without waiting a little bit for the extra love. I am a very patient person and I am fine with waiting a little bit for a good meal.  Today I found out the Toasty Cheese food truck was going to be in my neck of the woods and decided I would bring a friend (who had never had Toasty Cheese before) to join me for lunch today. 

We made a point to get there a little early (11:30am) to beat most of the lunch rush since it was parked in a corporate parking lot. There were only a couple people in line ahead of us but I noticed it was pretty slow moving... long pauses in between orders. We placed our order and were told it would be about a 10 minute wait. Okay. 5 minutes pass... I notice more patrons are walking up and asking about their online orders. Wait.... online orders? You mean to tell me there is this invisible line of about 10-15 people that I don&#39;t know about? Very misleading and very disappointing that Toasty Cheese is depending on three employees to manage about 30 orders at a time and expect people to walk away happy from the experience. What a terrible idea and a slap in the face to their loyal customers who patiently wait in the rain or in the cold to pay a premium price for a sandwich. My 10 minute wait turned into 35 minutes and during that time I noticed several people coming back to the truck because items were missing from their order or they received the wrong sandwich. When my order was finally ready I had to remind the guy who was bagging up orders (who was also TERRIBLY disorganized, not calling order numbers or lining up bags to be filled) that I also ordered a coke. He hands me a glass bottle of coke but I don&#39;t realize until I am already in my car that I need a bottle opener to enjoy it! Our sandwiches were lukewarm at best. It was such a frustrating experience, especially since I was raving to my friend about how amazing this place was. He told me that he would never go out of his way to visit this food truck again because the bad service was not worth it, and honestly I probably wont either. 

Later today I found out that some other employees in my office went to Toasty Cheese and waited OVER AN HOUR for their food. The only reason they didnt ditch was because it would have been so much more hassel to demand their money back with such a long line. By 12:30pm they were turning customers away because they were &#34;too busy.&#34;  

Online orders for a food truck = bad experience. Get rid of this. Your employees will appreciate it, too."

Finally made it out to the food truck for lunch in our area.  Having seen the reviews and the truck in the past, it&#39;s been a place that I&#39;ve wanted to try for a while.  

Ended up getting the Great Dane and Classic Fries.  That was probably a mistake.  
The Great Dane clearly had some good ingredients.  The bacon was well cooked and not stringy, and the cheeses blended well together and had great flavor.  Unfortunately the bread was burned pretty bad, so the whole tone of the sandwich ended up being mostly charcoal. 

The fries were fairly normal fries.  The seasoning wasn&#39;t there, so it ended up being mostly normal, crunchy fries.  The packaging also wasn&#39;t very heat resistant, so even in the very short ride back to the office, they ended up being pretty cold.  In terms of value, the fries are pretty small.  The only saving grace there is you get so much weight from the grease and fat that you don&#39;t need quite as much to fill you up.  YMMV.

Overall a little bit of a disappointment, but most of the raving has been about some of the more exotic items, so going back to basics at this truck may have been a poor choice.  Probably worth another shot."

Toasty Cheese had the longest line and now I know why, they have a nice variety on their menu and the food tastes awesome here.  Ordered the Chef&#39;s Choice which was definitely a A+ sandwich, a nice twist on the classic BLT.  My group also ordered the Mighty Max, Greek Fries, and the Lucky Luis Bites. 

Their sandwiches have bold flavors and are memorable.  They also don&#39;t skimp out on the ingredients and give you a nice thick sandwich that will make you full! 

Their entire menu, is probably all delicious and I would have to come back again to try them all.  The Lucky Luis Bites was probably my overall favorite.  You get a cup of hot giant fluffy beignets to dip with your choice of sauce.  In my case I chose the raspberry sauce for the tartness to complement with the sweetness of the beignets."

I was crying. I couldn&#39;t eat more than a few bites, and I can typically handle spicy eats. However, the flavors were complex and delicious, and I really only blame myself for attempting something that could start nuclear war in my mouth. 

Fast forward a few months and I chose a tamer sammie this time around - The Great Dane with tomatoes. I enjoyed perfectly buttery grilled cheese smashed with a plentiful amount of applewood smoked bacon and tomatoes. Nothing crazy, but yum-tastic nonetheless. I paired my sandwich with a cup of the soup of the day - tomato bisque. The soup was full of basil and the chunkier texture went great with my sandwich. I&#39;ll definitely get that combo again! 

I&#39;ve also sampled the sweet potato fries, which come with a topping of honey/pepper mixture on top. The flavor is nice, but the fries were soft and when paired with the topping, the texture let me down a bit. 

I know I&#39;ll definitely be back for more toasty cheeses in the future - I love the concept, the truck and the folks behind it!"

But of course, I did. And I am so glad I did! My first encounter was the obvious choice -  Chef&#39;s pick. I was a little apprehensive about duck bacon, not gonna lie. But it was great, and that mayo....omg that mayo. It&#39;s the perfect combination. I also got their french fries DRENCHED in cheese and topped with bacon. Seriously. I can&#39;t even deal with how good that was.

Today, I tried the Mighty Max which is pretty basic. It has grass fed rib eye, red onions, and butter. All on a fluffy, round pretzel bun. This time, I decided to pair it with the Fire french fries. Yea this is definitely the combination I was meant to try. The meat on the sandwich was nice and juicy. And as an onion lover, the flavor was perfection. Then the fries. I am a big lover of spicy food, and these were downright tear-jerking spicy. And although I don&#39;t mind it, it did take me a while to devour the huge portion. I also found that since the fries come with an overload of cheese, dipping my sandwich in it gave it a nice touch."

Excellent food from a menu that is truly unique in this area.  The service is attentive, cheerful and tries hard to make your dining experience enjoyable.

It&#39;s just a little removed from some of the hotbed of restaurants in the centers of Arlington Heights and Mt Prospect, but worth the extra 2 minutes drive!

With the multiple upscale Mexican, Thai, tapas, Italian, and steak restaurants in the area, NONE have anything close to this menu.  This was our third visit and we&#39;ve never had a single item here in which we were disappointed. This time we had the Salmon Tarte and the wild mushroom polenta appetizers... Both were amazing.  The duck ready with cherries and mashed potatoes was equally fantastic.  

If this place were in downtown Arlington Heights, it would be an hour wait to be seated 7 days per week.  Luckily, it&#39;s not, so seating is not a problem.  This is a wonderful place for a date night.  Upscale but comfortable.  French-inspired cuisine but unassuming.  It&#39;s just a great little restaurant.  You won&#39;t be disappointed."

The food seems relatively expensive for the area, $10-30 for sandwiches to entrees. Soups were one size at $7.50 and desserts were roughly $7-9 each. We split 3 appetizers, butternut squash ravioli, beef carpaccio, and the escargot. Both the ravioli and escargot were tasty, but there was maybe 3 large ravioli. Kind of small in terms of portions. 

I had the toasted croque monseiur. The side salad had a wonderful dressing and the sandwich was packed with meat. Some coworkers had the steak and were raving about their dishes. 

Now we all ordered dessert and I looked forward to the strawberry shortcake. But was extremely disappointed that this shortcake was a extremely hard cookie texture biscuit. My idea of shortcake is a soft a light cake layer. 

On a side note, they had wonderful crunchy yet soft French bread with a wonderfully flavored butter. But the complimentary bread and side salad should not have been the stars of the meal. 
Would I come back to this place? Probably not. While it was fine, there was no wow and service was kind of slow even though we were one of ew patrons in the beginning."

I&#39;ll take what I can get, and it&#39;s not even as if I was settling.  Retro Bistro truly does hold its own against the French food you&#39;d find in Paris (sorry, but I will ALWAYS compare any French food in the states to that actually in France).  Not only is the food reminiscent of the real thing, but so is the service and the structure of the meal.  What I mean is this: the meal takes longer because it has multiple courses, they also offer a three course pre-fixed menu (a common thing found in France)...they even offer water in carafes!  Basically, I was transported back to my beloved French cafes by eating at Retro Bistro.

You might forget that you&#39;re dining in Mount Prospect and actually peep out a &#34;Merci&#34; when the waiter comes to check on you.  Speaking of the service - it was truly impeccable, and I&#39;d even say that it was some of the best service I&#39;d received in a long while.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu while making good suggestions (though we didn&#39;t really listen to him, and we ordered completely different things).  Our waiter held himself in a very professional manner while being jovial; Retro Bistro very clearly hires and trains good waiters and waitresses. 

Retro Bistro seems to do everything right, whether we are talking about the service, the atmosphere or the food obviously!  Everything that we had was phenomenal, though I have to say my favorite thing was the roquefort and poached pear flambe tart.  It came out looking like part-pizza and part-flatbread, but really it is in a category of its own.  I absolutely loved the salty sweetness of this flambe!  This same sort of flavor profile proliferated the entree we split - the confit leg duck and duck sausage.  The entree was surprisingly sweet and despite all the ingredients in there, nothing seemed out of place - the entree was amazing!  

Hmm...let&#39;s see here - what else was amazing?  Oh yes - the charcuterie and cheese board! Apparently you can get just the cheese board though I don&#39;t know what all you&#39;d get on it because when we ordered the whole thing it only came with one type of cheese.  The rest of the board was filled with meat, sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, olives, bread/crackers and grapes.  There&#39;s no doubt about the fact that everything was delicious, but it was a little deceiving - we&#39;d thought there&#39;d have been more cheese please.  Finally, we splurged on some dessert, though we surely didn&#39;t need it after all that rich food.  We ordered the creme brûlée and chocolate soufflé cake upon the recommendation of the waiter.  Both were delicious, though we thought the chocolate cake was supposed to be of a more mousse-like texture and it wasn&#39;t the case.  No matter, though, because it was delicious and perfectly paired with raspberry sauce. 

I may have had a stomach ache like nobody&#39;s business after eating all this delightfully rich food, but I wouldn&#39;t trade it for anything.  Retro Bistro is a wonderful restaurant excels in every aspect of what they do."

My parents love french food when we travel, so I was excited to hear that this place is authentic and delicious.  Their 30th anniversary was coming up and I wanted to plan a special night for them.

I called and spoke with the manager two weeks in advance.  I asked if it would be possible to make reservations and preorder our meal.  He checked with the chef and confirmed that this was possible.  I proceeded to place my order.  I ordered a variety of dishes and requested that they be brought out in a timely manner.  This was essentially the primary reason that I was interested in ordering ahead.  I also requested that the check be handed to me.  The manager sounded optimistic and happy to provide these accommodations for my parents anniversary.

Our reservations were for 6:30 and we arrived at 6:25.  We were told to wait by the hostess.  We ended up waiting 10 minutes in the lobby before we were even sat at our table, which was not set up in advance.  After being seating, they clumsily brought over place settings and menus.  At this time, I informed the staff that I had already made arrangements.  

After another 10 minutes, our server finally showed up.  I again had to remind this person that I had already ordered everything: appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts.  At this point, I&#39;m starting to shake my head.  And we should have just left.  It took 35 minutes from the time we were seated to begin receiving any food.

To make a long story short, the service was terrible.  There was so much time in between food arriving that my parents were just tired.  We were practically falling asleep.  Nothing was really that memorable.  We had tartare, escargot, fish, several duck dishes...  It wasn&#39;t bad, but not great either.  Perhaps partially due to incredibly slow service that leaves you falling asleep at the table.

Then came the grand finale.  After finishing our main courses, the idiot server just brought the check over and handed it to my dad!!!  WHAT JUST HAPPENED???  I had ordered three desserts, which of course never came.  And then my dad has the check for a dinner that I planned as a surprise.  Outstanding.  And besides, what business wants to sell less?  What a joke.

The disorganization of this place caused me a huge embarrassment.  So overall, this was a horrible experience that practically ruined the entire evening.  I just want to thank the owner and/or manager for falsely building up my hope and then tearing it down with a lazy, lackadaisical attitude."

It&#39;s a bistro--come as you are for the food and friendship.  The wine list is good, and the staff knowledgable.  The portions here are generous, so you have to be careful about ordering too much.  Maybe you all could share those appetizers?

Wonderful flavor, plenty of pheasant - hold the feathers of course. Could have been a tad warmer, but overall a good choice.

Onto the entree - Mahi Mahi. Yummy Yummy - nice flavor and over some homemade mashed potatoes that were very good. To finish the evening, I ordered a Creme Brulee - that too was very pleasing.

My boyfriend and I have been here twice, once for lunch and dinner. It was a stellar lunch, well paced service to get you out in a timely fashion to head back to work. The escargot is to DIE for! 6 pieces served in a cast iron dish with a delicious herb butter sauce topped with a puff pastry, amazing. I&#39;ve tried escargot at multiple french restaurants in the city and this one is tops them all for me. 

Why I decided to give them four stars is because of some of the food components that we didn&#39;t exactly enjoy. My boyfriend had the duck confit with the duck sausage, sausage was okay but the duck confit with a sort of cranberry sauce was top notch. I&#39;ve had one of their duck specials which was perfectly cooked but I didn&#39;t care for the sauce or the sides at that time. I&#39;ve also had their strip steak at dinner and I definitely wolfed down that whole thing- perfect medium rare.

I can&#39;t exactly put my finger on it but for some reason we seem to like lunch better than dinner. I wish I remembered my waiter&#39;s name from our dinner experience because he was amazing, courteous, didn&#39;t rush us, knowledgeable and overall, made our experience pleasant. Would&#39;ve loved to give him credit from someone who is also in the industry."

We started with the Ravioli (they call them wontons???) stuffed with goat cheese in a tomato sauce with polenta. It was very good but IMO overloaded with cheese which throws the balance of the dish off. The wonton was super thin (and good) and the tomato sauce was mild (and good) so the cheese powered right thru it. The polenta was also really good, buttery but not overly so.

Next had the shrimp and crab cake. It is basically a hockey puck of ground seafood meat. This sounds bad but it really sums it up. If you&#39;ve ever had shumi from an asian place you will be right at home with this. The flavors of the cake and sauce are good but it&#39;s dense because they do not add bread etc as a binder to it. It&#39;s all shrimp and crab! A good item to share.

I had a salad lyonnaise to follow. Nice greens, bacon, etc but it had 2-3x the amount of dressing needed for my small, pooling at the bottom of the bowl... otherwise it would have been perfect.

Had the Duck &amp; Sausage. The duck was good, the sausage was not my style, possibly made with some liver or blood to I&#39;ve it a slight irony flavor. I just assume this is how certain sausages are made more so in Europe etc but I just don&#39;t eat them often. 

Steak Parisian was next. A nice strip steak cooked just about medium and some nice thin frites. They call them home fries on the menu which makes me think of thicker steak fries. Regardless this was a pretty solid dish. 

I can see returning to sample a few other things..."

It was a major turnoff about every 5 minutes late interrupt our conversation to ask her that would like another drink.  We ordered 4 drinks and with tip it was 50 dollars, and the drinks were not big at all.

The atmosphere seem very strip mallish so it doesn&#39;t feel high class and with the aggressive selling it just seemed like a place that was just a bar.  I think they wanted the place to seem French but there&#39;s nothing French like at retro Bistro

I&#39;d say about 4.5 stars overall.  They&#39;ve been here 25 years, but you wouldn&#39;t guess it from the look of the modernized strip mall they are located in.  In addition to their regular menu, we learned they have a daily $35 three course prix fixe menu, so I went with that.  Wife had a roasted chicken salad and samplings from my 3 courses.  I ordered a nice chilled cucumber soup, pork tenderloin medallions, and chocolate profiteroles.  I enjoyed all the courses and which all had great taste, flavor, and presentation.  The profiteroles were the nicest and most flavorful presentation I&#39;ve had for such and came with delectable white chocolate, raspberrry, and chocolate sauces.  They had a nice vibrant weekday crowd, and everyone here except possibly for us were wine drinkers.  Overall, a very nice French-themed dinner spot in this part of Chicagoland."

(See also: Hysterical pregnancy. Then cut to my making loud exhaling noises while waddling out of here... then cut to 30-minutes later with me at home massaging cocoa butter and Vaseline into my stomach skin to avoid getting stretch marks from this truly gut-busting meal)

The thing is, I think were doing pretty good right up until the point we decided to order TWO desserts. We had no regrets about it until a good 10 minutes had passed since our last sweet bite... then the itis started to set in and that&#39;s when it became pretty obvious that while she was the only one pregnant with a baby, we were both pretty pregnant with one course too many of some of the finest French fair I&#39;ve ever had.

The atmosphere is relaxing and adorable. There&#39;s a cute bar that you walk in to, but we sat at a table in the regular dining area which was just as cute and had lots of natural lighting. The menu had numerous options but I was drawn to their full page of specials, the Grilled Hawaiian Escolar (which the internet now tells me *may* have some kinda gross side-effects, but I haven&#39;t experienced any yet and I&#39;ve eaten at Hooters enough times to not really be effected by it anyway.)

I have no regrets about the Escolar whatsoever. It was some of the best and well-cooked fish I&#39;ve ever had. The grill taste was superb and as my prego-friend would be quick to remind, came with some seriously bitchin&#39; mashed potatoes. Almost life-changing. When I go back, if Escolar is on the menu I&#39;ll 100% order that again and again. 

For dessert with split both the pineapple tart and flour-less chocolate cake a la mode. I don&#39;t regret getting either, but I do regret the amount of it that I let myself eat. We polished them off like we were eating for a dozen and took to nursing out Republic of Tea Pomegranate and Ginger-Peach iced teas. 

The staff here are really on top of their game. If you drop a crumb, they&#39;ll be there to sweep it away and a split second after you&#39;re done licking your plate they&#39;ll be there to clear it for you. Really nice people and beared with us through our laptops-open lunch and making what seemed like a Sophie&#39;s choice of a decision when it came to dessert."

Lamb Shank and Skate Wing entrees were excellent. The Prix Fixe offerings are a great deal if you&#39;re the type that eats everything.

The service is consistently great and you can almost always get a table or a seat at the small bar (reservations recommended on weekend evenings). Recently (May 2015) they changed their menu (heavily meat based) and on my most recent visit the food was not up to their usual excellent standards. I usually order from their changing special menu, however both the dishes I ordered were over-cooked and over-salted. I will continue to dine at Retro Bistro and hope that whatever is happening in the kitchen will improve as this restaurant is a gem in the northwest suburbs.

We didn&#39;t have a reservation and were seated right away, which was nice.  The attitude we were being done a favor when the dining room was half-empty was unnecessary.
Our server was friendly but incredibly condescending to a table of two foodies and a professional.  She also pushed the upsell in two ways that were upsetting - wine to two people who don&#39;t drink and offering things directly to my seven year old godson instead of consulting his parents. We ended up with an $8.50 bottle of lemonade and a $5.50 dessert for him.  I ordered a cocktail and had to ask for it twice.
All the adults did the Prix Fixe.  The mussels were a big hit, but the watermelon salad included canned mandarin oranges.  The pork au poivre and potatoes were excellent, but the fish was more a Russian than French preparation.  Desserts were terrible - creme brulee top was carbonized rather than caramelized, and Baked Alaska was really an ice cream filled Napoleon. 
The lighting and music were pleasant."

Well, I did at Retro Bistro. And let me state up front - it was not Retro Bistro&#39;s fault. All items were cooked beautifully and thoroughly, cleanliness was completely up to par and there were no health code issues in sight. 

No no, the issue I had with my amazing lunch at Retro Bistro was the actual ingredients themselves. For those who haven&#39;t enjoyed the fish escolar - be warned. I&#39;m not going to go into specifics, but if you have a sensitive tummy or consume over six ounces of this butterfish, things can go south very very fast. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. I wish someone would have give me that head&#39;s up before I stuffed my face full of their grilled escolar lunch special. It was buttery. Delicious. Swimming in a lovely champagne ginger sauce. And sat atop the most incredible mashed potatoes and carrots. 

But of course, Candice G and I are often not just satisfied with a great meal. Dessert had to happen. Times two. The chocolate lava cake a la mode was a delight and the pineapple tart was a nice yang to the rich yin of our other dessert choice.

So - moral of the story? If you&#39;re about to embark into new waters, make sure you look up the rogue fish you&#39;ll be consuming. It may be beyond delicious, but you may pay for it later. No regrets."

We came in and they didn&#39;t have any tables except at the bar which was understandable since it was Saturday at 530pm. At the bar we started out with a blonde woman who had an accent as a server. We did not like her due to being pushy, rushing us, and yelling orders into the kitchen window like it was a 50&#39;s diner. Very unprofessional and obnoxious. The other server helping us was a male with a beard and he was much more pleasant. 
As for the food we really liked the taste of the sauce they put on the peppercorn steak, but the quality of the meat was poor.

We accidentally got here half an hour before they opened and spotted the entire staff having dinner together. Always neat to see that.

After a little driving around (not much too see around here, heh) we returned and were seated by the window. The cheerfully romantic ambiance made me feel like I was in a festive city restaurant. The music contributed a lot to the mood--a mix of lilting French music and Sinatra-esque songs. 

Loved the warm crusty bread with scrumptious tapenade that we were served in the beginning. I ordered the oyster mushroom polenta special and the roquefort and pear tart. Wow, the mushroom dish was incredible. It had the heartiness and flavor of a beef stew (and it probably did have beef broth in it). It actually had a bit of an oyster-ish scent and flavor, which I&#39;ve never actually experienced in oyster mushrooms, but I liked it a lot.  

The pear tart basically looked like a pizza and was a bit on the small side for the price, but it was very good. They didn&#39;t mention it on the menu, but instead of a sauce beneath the toppings, it had caramelized onion! Also, it was served with a dipping sauce that seemed to be some kind of wine and beef broth mixture. So fantastic.

My partner ordered the Saturday $20 steak special and deemed it very good, better than the usual. Will be back on a Thursday to try the martini specials and maybe the veggie sandwich!"

In are area rife with chain restaurants, this independent eatery shines. While French Bistro fare is highlighted, it eschews they&#39;ll mark heavy sauces French food is known for. Instead, dishes are served that have bright flavors and interesting combinations.

On a recent visit, the very affordable special was Duck Confit with Duck Sausage. The confitted duck was fall-off the-bone tender, and the cherry sauce that accompanied it was just the right thing for cutting the richness of the dish.

It was lucky we had room for our entrees, having enjoyed the crusting bread and olive tapenade before hand a little too much!

Dessert was coconut cheesecake, which was somewhat of a letdown after the fine meal we ate. The gelee atop the cake was off putting. Stick to their regular cheesecake if you go. It was creamy and not too sweet.

The food lacked the fresh flavors of  good French restaurants, and the side dishes were so small I needed tweezers to find my string beans. The roasted chicken did have a tasty glaze. Desert was also bellow par. A pastry filled with ice cream topped with melted Belgian chocolate lacked the perfection of flakiness and tenderness you would expect from this little globe holding the ice cream. Maybe it&#39;s difficult getting the necessary ingredients out in Mount Prospect. And maybe the chef needs to be in the kitchen savoring each and every ingredients.
The owner/chef was at the entrance jovially greeting everyone and trying his best to make us feel welcomed, which he succeeded at. But whoever was in the kitchen needed to complement his welcome with a generous hot meal for a bon ami.

We all decided against the three course option and all chose a la carte. I had the mushroom polenta for app and the salmon for entree. One bro-in-law also got the Salmon. They other had a steak dish. Hubby had horseradish crusted chicken. 

My polenta was very good. It had a nice brown sauce mixed with the meaty mushrooms on top. Very satisfying.

The salmon was also very good. It wasn&#39;t over cooked. It had this fresh made salad of tomatoes and diced cucumbers and onions on top with a light creamy sauce. It was heaven. My bro-in-law kept raving about it. I agreed. 

The other two diners seemed &#34;ok&#34; with their choices. Hubby said it was too much of a punch of horseradish for him and scraped most of it off. 

We didn&#39;t order dessert... but this is the really nice part. We were celebrating a wedding and the birthday, so I bought this special rainbow cake. They did such a wonderful job of decorating it.

&#34;Engaging&#34; captures the short time spent at the bar before getting our table ready, the bartender offering us a delicious red wine while we nibbled on crackers and lentil spread.

&#34;Relaxed&#34; would aptly describe the rest of dinner, which for me centered around a perfectly medium-rare New York strip as I chatted with friends, this in spite of the noise levels. I finished with the profiterole and chocolate dessert and some very good coffee.

In the end, I think the word that best works is &#34;sincere&#34;.

There is a simple sincerity that permeates the dining experience, from the Chef/Owner greeting me at the door, the rustic yet accessible decor, the bartender&#39;s informed suggestions to our server&#39;s rapt attention. The Retro Bistro sincerely made this a classy good time."

For me, this restaurant belongs in the where I want to go whenever I want to dine at a top quality restaurant. 5 stars all the way!!

You enter the restaurant through the small, romantic bar area, greeted by the co-owner Chris.  French music plays softly in the background and French-themed artwork adorn the walls.

We tried the prix-fixe menu via a Living Social deal.  I felt adventurous and enjoyed the puff pastry escargot. We both ordered the amazing beef tenderloin. Wines were good, and went well with the meal.

Overall a very good experience. We&#39;ll definitely keep Retro Bistro on our list to return."

I took a guest and we both enjoyed the Prix Fix lunch menu. 
Items that we chose were the French Cheese Tart, The Florida Crab and Rock Shrimp Cake, French Onion Soup, Won- ton Ravioli, Chocolate Souffle and Berry Crumble.

The portions were generous and we shared all of the above. Not only was each dish more delicious than the last,  they were meticulously prepared and served attentively. We had a great server.

I must say that these were the best desserts I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life! And believe me, I&#39;ve eaten more than my share at the best bakeries and restaurants!

On my first visit, I tried the grilled chicken salad. The chicken was more like chicken salad (with mayo). I wasn&#39;t expecting that but it tasted good nonetheless. I&#39;ve returned on at least 3 different occasions for their Sunday brunch and all the menu items are always a hit. The warm bread and hummus(? or whatever it is that they serve with it) is phenomenal.

I have reviewed Retro Bistro before and it has been our favorite go-to restaurant since they opened more than 20 years ago.  They have never varied from their original mission - wonderful innovative food.  Today we tried their Sunday Brunch for the first time and it was incredible.  They have a $25 pre-fixed menu that includes a drink (Bloody Mary for me), appetizer (escargot in puff pastry), entree ( eggs benedict with crab and shrimp) and dessert (best fruit plate ever).  My husband had an equally wonderful brunch and we had a $55 check.  Quite a bargain and it was delicious."

For an entree I had the lamb shank. Omg. Best lamb I have ever had!! So tender it fell right off the bone and the mashed potatoes were to die for!

The prices are a little expensive but then again I&#39;m in college so that might be a relative statement.

I ordered a skirt steak sandwich and was quite thrilled with my order. The waiters were very kind and friendly and I would definitely recommend this place to other couples. They also have a bar and TVs for those sports lovers. We will defiantly go again !"

First off its located in a strip mall that I have lived close to my entire life and it wasn&#39;t until recently that I found this place. It&#39;s also right by a lot of other dinner spots. 

The owner greeted my girlfriend and I extremely nicely and gave us a table. The menu was a little confusing because it uses a lot of French or technical terms that most people have never heard of but the waiter was great in helping us pick a dish. The food was delicious and very flavotful. Lots of flavor combos that I have never had and it was really amazing.

The food is EXCELLENT, the service fine, but .... it&#39;s a poor value.  I love French Bistros and go to them whenever possible.  The problem with &#39;Retro&#39; is that their cocktails and wines are expensive and the pours are short.  This is especially true of their wine pours.  As a result, even a moderate drinker is going to run up a big tab.   In fairness, they do make their entire wine book available by the glass which is a big positive.

Do I love this place?  Yup.  Do I think it is worth it?  Nope.  There are just too many other good - and more reasonably priced - alternatives.
I can think of two other similar places in Chicagoland (Cafe Touche&#39; in Edison Park and Bistro Margaux on Wells St.) that are just as good and far better values.  And ... if you want the shock of your life, go to Sheboygan Wisconsin when you have a day, and eat at Margaux there ... oh dear heavens what a phenomenal place."

I came for dinner on a pretty quiet night with my friend and I absolutely fell in love. The staff was friendly and warm. I strangely felt like they were family, they were just that sweet. My friend and I ordered appetizers which were delicious! We ordered the escargot and a tart flambé which was so yummy I can taste it now. 
For dinner I had ordered a horrendous chicken plate, it was inedible, asked for them to take it back and they did without hesitation. The crust was salty, the sauce was bitter, but the chicken was cooked to perfection. When they took it back, I asked for a steak instead, and that was heavenly. Usually I don&#39;t finish my meal, but theirs I finished within ten minutes! It was mouth wateringly good. The steak was juicy and the butter on top was a perfect compliment to it. Their fries were delicious, I actually judge places on their fry quality (just to show how good they really were). Overall the meal was delectable apart from the chicken. 
Also, my friend ordered an alcoholic beverage and said their syrup to liquor ratio wasn&#39;t as good as it should have been. It was just too strong for her. (But I wouldn&#39;t know I&#39;m under 21 and am turned off by alcohol)."

I wasn&#39;t sure what the restaurant would be like since it&#39;s in the middle of strip mall, but I was pleasantly surprised. We were greeted very friendly and seated immediately when we arrived. The waitress came over right away and gave us menu and told us about the specials. There was a house made tapenade on the table, which was very good.

We don&#39;t frequent French restaurants very often, so we had several questions when looking at the menu. The waitress was very friendly and helpful in explaining the dishes to us and making recommendations. We had a tart for an appetizer, which is basically a flat bread pizza. For our entrees we had an open-faced Kobe beef burger and a rolled chicken breast. The food was fantastic. We didn&#39;t try any of the desserts because we were so full from our meals.

The restaurant ambiance was very relaxed. There was a nice crowd there for a Wednesday evening, so I can imagine it gets busy on the weekends and you would want to make a reservation.

I will definitely be going back here again to try more items on their menu. I recommend Wednesday nights because they have a $17/bottle wine special on select bottles. We couldn&#39;t take advantage of it because we already were using a Groupon, but will definitely be going back for that offer!"

We ordered from the 3 course, prix fix menu - I had ahi tuna appetizer, skate fish, and chocolate heart &amp; chocolate dipped strawberry for dessert.  I choose a nice Californian Sauv Blanc wine paired with the fish.  Hubby ordered lobster bisque soup, beef medallions, and crème brulee, with a glass of merlot.  Both of our meals were delicious!

I&#39;ve wanted to try other menu items but the burrito is so good that when I get to the counter to order &#39;steak burrito with sour cream&#39; just comes out of my mouth. It is outstanding. This is my standard for burritos. I compare all other burrito places to this one. I&#39;ve never been disappointed in the quality of food at Burrito Fantasico."

(I&#39;m shocked I hadn&#39;t seen it before since it&#39;s just down the street from my house, but I guess it is tucked back a little bit out of eyesight from the road.)

I&#39;m perfectly content ordering the burrito, though one of these times I&#39;m going to try out some of the other items. Personally, I liked the steak burrito better than the chorizo, and I&#39;m not big on refried beans. I just ask for it to not be on my burrito and they&#39;re great to accomodate. End result, good food at a good price.

The staff is very pleasant and helpful every time. I&#39;ve done a couple call-aheads and only have to wait for about a minute to pick it up. The order&#39;s right every time too--even special requests."

I went with a Giant Chorizo Burrito and added Sour Cream and Avocado, no Lettuce. The amount of Avocado was perfect, but there didn&#39;t seem to be that much Sour Cream or the Cheese it comes with.

We were served complimentary Chips &amp; Salsa. The spice level left my lips tingling in a good way. The Chorizo Burrito had a nice zing to it, but it was super, super greasy. I expected it to be slightly greasy, but it quickly disolved the bottom of my Burrito and filled the plate with brown grease. I tried to hold it together with one napkin, then two, then three. It was no use. I finally stopped the grease flow with five napkins. I&#39;ll probably try the Steak Burrito next time.

Pricing isn&#39;t bad for what you get. It was just under $20 for an XL Chicken Suizo Burrito, a Giant Chorizo Burrito with two additional toppings, a Mexican Coke and a Pineapple Jarritos, plus the Chips &amp; Salsa. I only ate about half the Burrito, so I got leftovers out of it."

Stopped by at 9:15 p.m. on Sunday to pick up the menu for the planning meeting.  Restaurant closes (allegedly) at 10, so no problem, right?  Wrong!!!!  The door was locked and the 6 people inside ( 2 in kitchen, 1 at register, 3 at table) pretended that they didn&#39;t see me, even though I knocked on the window and they looked at me.  I called the number listed on the door twice and the woman who answered told me to go to the restaurant for a menu.  How ironic!  Eventually 3 young men who were walking by tried to help me by yelling and banging on the door.  A little boy inside, probably 6 years old, got up and tried to figure out what we wanted.  The adults continued to pretend we (now 4 of us) were invisible.  The little boy gave the menu to an adult woman who came to the door and said they were closed.  When I explained that I just wanted the menu and what I was planning for, she said they close at 9 now and just hadn&#39;t had time to change the sign on the door, window, nor menu!!!  I told her it would have been nice if any one of them had been courteous enough to just slide a menu under the door, she said they aren&#39;t allowed to open the door once they close.

Lunch, dinner, or just a snack, the menu covers everything.  I wasn&#39;t so sure how crepes + Indian food relate, and honestly, I&#39;m still not sure what the two have to do with one another.  But the crepes were definitely D&#39;licious so I&#39;m curious about their Indian fare too.

I had the ham and cheese (gruyere) croissant which was really good.  The crepes are a generous size.  I was tempted to order their truffle fries, but the crepes are a good enough potion that you don&#39;t really need a side.  I would order another savory crepe without a second thought!

Since we spent a decent amount of time here, we also ordered dessert crepes.  I ordered a Nutella &amp; banana crepe.  I was actually served a strawberry &amp; Nutella crepe.  I didn&#39;t complain or send it back because I do like strawberries too.  But the strawberries made the crepe too watery.  There wasn&#39;t enough Nutella in the mix to sop up the extra moisture either.  My friend had a cinnamon crepe, which was filled with icing, and that looked like the better choice.  But for me, I&#39;d be a little gun shy about ordering another dessert crepe, especially one with strawberries or fruit with a high water content.

The marbled hot chocolate (white and dark chocolate) was both a beverage and dessert, so I definitely got my sweet tooth satisfied.  They also have coffee, lattes, and Coke products.

The Indian side of the menu lists items like samosas, roti, and something called Bombay fries.  We didn&#39;t try any of the Indian food, but it all sounded really good.

There is seating inside and outside at this casual downtown Bartlett cafe.  There&#39;s a downtown Bartlett?  It&#39;s near the Bartlett train station, and the downtown area was pretty sleepy on a Sunday morning mostly surrounded by dry cleaning businesses, medical offices, and other businesses that don&#39;t really grab your attention."

We ordered the Bombay fries( I love thin cut fries so this was the absolute fav), chicken tikka kathi roll and samosa burrito. The portions are filling.(wanted to try the sweet crepes too but no more space left on the device ;) )
Will go back just to try the dessert crepes.
I would suggest the owner to add some sort of a salad or fruit as a side just to give some brightness to the dishes. After eating for a while the palette becomes monotonous.

The menu has traditional sweet and savory crepes, but in a delightfully unique twist, it also features Indian flavored rolls and burritos! What a fantastic fusion!!! 

I ordered takeout over the phone. When my mom and I walked in, we were immediately greeted by a hostess who quickly stepped behind the register to pull up our order. I had ordered the Indian items; Nihari Kathi roll, chicken Tikka Kathi roll, lamb vindaloo burrito, butter chicken burrito, and samosa chole chat. The Kathi rolls have scrambled eggs, the burritos have rice.

Every single roll I had was delicious.  I was impressed with the authentic flavor of the Nihari beef. My favorite was the butter chicken roll because the butter chicken sauce had mixed with the rice. It was delicious!! 

The roti (bread) used for the rolls was perfectly soft and fluffy.

And we ended the night with a smiling Tuti Fruiti Crepe dessert which was way too adorable. I only wish my 5 month old could enjoy this as well! So cute! We will be back again, especially for the Mango Lassi. 

The owner, Rakesh personally serves and greet you. He was polite and courteous as well as the rest of his staff. This is what local business is about and I&#39;m so proud to be a patron. I&#39;m so glad they re-opened. It was fate. Every penny spent was worth it and felt good here! Highly recommend this place.

We were walking around and stumbled upon this adorable crepe and coffee place. When I looked at the menu, I noticed they also served Indian street sandwiches as well as delicious gelato. They had all my favorite food in one restaurant. Since I couldn&#39;t decide Indian burrito or crepe, my boyfriend ordered a crepe and I ordered a paneer makhani roti burrito thing. We also ordered Parmesan truffle fries with an aioli sauce. Everything was so delicious, I had to be rolled out of the door! The owner and wait staff are super attentive and friendly. We also ordered a banana and chocolate gelato milkshake to go. I highly recommended trying this place out!!"

I was a bit skeptical as it closes at 9, and generally speaking, this is about the time you open yourself up for food poisoning at any restaurant. How ever, we were pleasantly surprised about about the entire encounter with Indian food at a French place. 

I was a bit apprehensive at first because I didn&#39;t understand the concept. We walked in and there were murals of the Eiffel Tower and peacocks. Odd. We sat out selves at a very small bistro style table and looked around the joint. 6 or 7 tiny tables inside...4 or 5 larger ones outside...fairly clean. After looking at the menu, I decided to get the chicken tikka kathi roll and paneer kathi roll. And the Bombay fries. Nothing was French about this meal other than the FRENCH fries. Ok that was a stupid joke. But seriously, the menu was extensive and there was a lot of French sounding items. A lot of crepes and what have you. 

Our food came of out and the rolls were HUGE. Not like the nyc kathi rolls that one may be accustomed to. This was more like a burrito. Before i get to the rolls, I must comment on the fries. Possibly the best fries I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Better than McDonald&#39;s, homie. They were French cut...hehehe, and topped with a masala. I thought it was black salt sanchar, but it was jeerala or something. The rolls were pretty good as well, but there was room for improvement. Mind you it was 45 minutes till closing time and perhaps a better experience might we have had an hour before. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they were pretty damn good. All I kept saying was how clean everything tastes. It was just a clean fresh flavor. The chicken and the paneer could have been 20% more juicy, but everything just tasted very clean. 

Around 20 minutes into our service, the owner came out to talk to us. This is always a great sign. He told us he used to own a place at U of I. He told me he owned a crepes place in Urbana and invented a liquid roti recipe he can feed into the crepe machine. He catered to the Indian crowd there and then decided to open up this place in his home town of Bartlett after his lease ended in Urbana. 

Pros. Super Clean and friendly. 

Cons. Small. Mosquitos. Closes at 9. 

Sorry for the abrupt ending to this review. I gotta go now.

I will absolutely be returning and absolutely recommend to others. 

Get the FRENCH fries! Haha. Ok I&#39;m done."

The savory crepe was delicious and excellent. Fresh herbs baked into the crepe itself. 

My favorite was the signature ham and cheese crepe. The recipe is unique to me, and the herbs on top were supremely fresh. If you like a ham and cheese omelet, order this- it&#39;s like an omelet, only 1,000 times better.

The coffee is imported from France, and we had a lovely cup of French press. 

The owner came to our table, introduced himself, and told us all about their coffee.

It was a delightful experience. I highly recommend!"

I got a recommendation to come here a while ago and have had the place saved on my phone since.  while still being relatively cheap, the crepes taste gourmet and the portions are large.  not to mention, there is a wide variety of items in the menu.  between my friends and me, we had a Greek, buffalo chicken, and D&#39;licious (their signature) crepe; all were very good.  lastly, I give much praise for the serving staff and the decor &amp; music, as they both made for a comfortable atmosphere and a relaxing brunch.  my only complaint is that they open at 9.  I prefer a little bit of an earlier breakfast.

as a side note, this pace would be a good one to come and study at for a while."

But u can order ahead to go if you&#39;re in a rush. 

Super fresh ingredients! The seasoned tator tots are so yummy and their homemade garlic aioli dipping sauce is delicious. My daughter and I shared the Tutti Fruiti crepe... the fresh fruit and Nutella filling was amazing! I order a steak, egg &amp; cheese crepe to go to take home for my hubby.

It&#39;s clear the owner takes pride in his food. The crepes are large and bursting with flavor. I went for the spinach artichoke with chicken and it did not disappoint. Only ate half so I could save room for a dessert crepe. Also large enough to share with a friend. Outside seating available to enjoy in nice weather. Owner is hands on and very attentive during our visit. He brought a complimentary coffee beverage to our table as we lingered in conversation. Nice surprise.  No batch coffee here! Each cup made to order. Or and order a plate of truffle fries to share as a side with your lunch. One thing I noticed is the plates are plastic and a bit large for the small tables. I guess you need large plates to hold the large crepes.

The service here is the best I&#39;ve had, bar none. I believe the gentleman helping us was the owner, he absolutely insisted on giving us top quality service.  He began moving tables together for us unasked, helped us move outside because it was nice out, helped us back inside when the mosquitoes found us, etc etc, all without missing a beat.  He was very attentive without ever being a bother.  (Yes, for the negative nellies out there I know that&#39;s how it should work anyway, but it&#39;s rare to get all that with a smile on the person&#39;s face and a friendly, helpful personality too!)  He made sure my friend and I had the best possible girls&#39; night out. 

THE FOOD THOUGH!!!

I was debating between dishes and he helped me select the cordon bleu crepe.  Juicy chicken, nice chunks of ham.  The spinach, tomato slices, and balsamic glaze drizzle they add was the perfect thing to brighten up what could easily have been a too heavy dish.  I added a side of super yummy truffle fries.

SO GOOD. 

For desserts they have a nice selection of gelato, I got the salted caramel.  Mmmmm.  It was delicious, I would go back just for that!

I&#39;m already trying to plan my next visit and I live nowhere near this lovely little restaurant.  Do yourself a favor, grab a bottle of something you like and head over there for a great meal in a super lowkey setting."

All of the food was freshly cooked, but I just didn&#39;t understand what they were doing with the flavors - there was a variety of them but they just didn&#39;t soak into the food. It all tasted very bland. 

The fries had no taste, and I didn&#39;t like the sauce it came with. They had spices on them already, and I tried dunking them into the sauce that I didn&#39;t like, but the fries still had no taste.

When I first got the burrito, it looked great. I poked a knife in it and steam was coming out. I then tried a piece of the chicken and it was good - very well cooked and had a good amount of spice  to it (ordered it spicy). But then I started eating the burrito and it was just very plain. All of the ingredients tasted very fresh and were great individually, but they just did&#39;t come together. The issue was the rice and the roti that was used to wrap the burrito. Neither of those had any flavor, so when eating the burrito all together, the flavor from the chicken got lost and the flavor from the sauce just didn&#39;t soak in with the rest of it.

The people working there were great and the food was fresh and well cooked, but it was the flavors they used and how they used them that I didn&#39;t like."

The place is clean, interesting decor, also was just getting busy, there were clearly a number of return customers and interesting menu.  I ordered the savoury d&#39;licious breakfast crepe but really didn&#39;t enjoy the flavor combination.  Thought it was supposed to have spinach.  There was 1 spinach leaf on the top.  Inside was mostly ham, mushrooms and pecans.  A dollop of goat cheese on top drizzled with honey.  Was it supposed to have egg as well?  There were none now that I think about it!  Off day??  Since so many have given it rave reviews, And others seemed to be enjoying it I may try again but can&#39;t recommend based on my experience.

Update;
Just double checked the menu.  My crepe definitely didn&#39;t have key ingredients!  No eggs, no spinach except the 1 leaf.  Very disappointing!  The only redeeming aspect was being offered more tea to go when I left."

The food here truly is very good. I rarely like Indian food because every place I&#39;ve been to prior the food tasted like it was mass produced, frozen, and then reheated in a microwave; i.e. it&#39;s always brownish, mushy, and what little flavor it does have is just bad. Here they do the super weird thing of making the food on location and per order, I know crazy right!?! Take note, other Indian places.

The paneer tikka saag is easily my favorite. But in case you&#39;re wondering the chicken tikka and butter chicken are mouth-watering good. Give this place a try and you&#39;ll soon become regulars like my family and me."

While the food is pretty good it was the service that stood out. The owner works every day and makes you feel at home. Nothing better than to have the owner visit your table and explain things and offer to help.  He even let us know about free coffee in the mornings.. I suggest the strawberry crepe with ice cream..

We were in the area at lunch time and decided to see what French Indian cuisine is all about - it&#39;s delicious!!!  The owner came and spoke with us and was so friendly, we were very impressed. Mango lassi, delicious!  Twee started w Masala fries- yum! The dipping sauce was awesome.  Then I had a chicken tikka burrito and my husband has a Beef burrito- great ratio of meat to rice, the raita really added to the meal. I wish there was one of these in Chicago we would be there all the time!  Well done!"

That all being said this place was awesome. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door and it only got better from there. Beautiful French Press coffee served with steamed milk and a biscuit. They took the time to review the menu items explaining all the different options. The truffle fries came out first cooked and seasoned perfectly. Then the savory crêpe&#39;s came out. Fresh ingredients, cooked perfectly hot, full of flavor. This was a great little find that I will make the trip from Mchenry to come back to."

India wasn&#39;t even an French colony! France and England (India was their colony) are as far apart as it gets in the culinary world. That&#39;s what I thought to myself until we decided to stop by today. It sounds illogical but tastes great! In short, they made it work! I had a spicy burrito as and a hot sauce lover, I figured I&#39;ll get the usual bit of Tabasco or some other mild sauce. I was wrong! It was pleasantly hot. I wouldn&#39;t want it any hotter.

Because I could, I ordered the Samosa Chole Chat (technically a side) with Masala Fries, which are shoestring fries dusted with garam masala. My wife ordered a chicken crepe.

The service was overwhelmingly nice, and very positive. It&#39;s probably a good thing, too, since it can be challenging for a novice to navigate the Indian side of the menu. Also, consider holding off on your morning coffee so that you can try their chai; I haven&#39;t tried it yet, but it&#39;s definitely what I&#39;m going back for.

My wife&#39;s crepe was good, but the samosa... I can&#39;t really summarize what was in it very well (chickpeas, tamarind... everything else, I have no idea how to pronounce or can&#39;t tell you what it is) but it is vegetarian and it is delicious, and yes you absolutely need to order it.

I&#39;m on slightly firmer ground with the fries, which have a hefty dose of fresh garam masala spice and a side of tomato sauce (not ketchup!).

It&#39;s a full service place, but the food came out fast and with a smile. I have absolutely no doubt that I will be back for some more great Indian food."

The crepes are a very generous size (i can&#39;t even eat the whole thing in one sitting) and they are made behind glass in the lobby where you can see them being made if you like. All fresh ingredients are used. It&#39;s also fun to sit outside on the patio in the summertime. Come out and enjoy. These kinds of dining options are few and far between.

I love introducing people to new great restaurants. We ordered iced caramel macchiatos. Usually elsewhere these are way too sweet, but here they were perfect,  not really sweet not bitter. I ordered the bombay fries again,  this time there was a little less seasoned but still good. My mom &amp; I got the vegetarian version of the viva la crêpe. As an option they replace the meat with avocado. We were very satisfied. My dad ordered the strawberry banana crêpe. It was served to him with a smiley face made of the fruit on top.

I really liked the location of this place; It&#39;s really quaint. As soon as we walked in, we were politely greeted and told that we could sit anywhere. It was quiet and, for a couple of minutes we were the only people there. I think since it wasn&#39;t so busy they decided not to play music because I did see a speaker up above. The little restaurant is beautifully decorated with paintings of the Eiffel tower and Les Miserables on one side and Indian paintings on the other. Our waitress was so kind and explained the menu beautifully. The menu is half Indian and half French but crepe-like pancakes were infused into almost everything. They make the roti with the crepe pan as well leaving the roti thin but very flavorful. 

We were only going to get dessert there but after looking at the menu, I decided to order something to go as well. Our food came out quickly. We had the tutti fruity dessert crepe which was wonderful! We also ordered ice cream with it, which was exactly what I was craving. It came with bananas, strawberries, and Nutella. It was delicious! We then ordered the butter chicken to go. It came with green sauce, which made the meal all the better. Although it wasn&#39;t traditional butter chicken, it was delightful. 

Everything was super affordable and sounded super appealing! Our waitress also was kind in answering an unrelated question about what we should do after the meal. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more things! I really want to try something off of the French side of the menu and also some of their breakfast crepes (eggs w/ mozzarella and aioli)! 

I highly recommend this place to anyone honestly; it doesn&#39;t hurt to check this place out!"

However, they struggle with making spicy food. Their spicy chutney is an unconvincing emulsion of tomato sauce and crushed red peppers. I&#39;m used to getting ass kicking spicy when I ask for it, so it&#39;s a space they improve in.

Food was great, service was near perfect but albeit they need to tighten up their carry out orders a bit.
They billed me for 2 items yet provided just 1 item during one of the least peak hours.

I walked in at 8:40pm on a Wednesday and I&#39;m literally the only customer who placed at order until they closed. 2 items: Lamb vindaloo kathi roll and samosa chole (really not a complicated order) and yet they managed to tightly pack up the carry out bag with just 1 item and closed for the night before sending me on my way.

They might had good intentions but they need to figure out how to stop making rookie mistakes. I get this can happen when a restaurant is super busy but irks me that I was the only person who placed an order 20mins prior to close and they still got it wrong.

With that being said, carry out customers please double check your bag.

P.S I believe the owner took my order maybe that&#39;s where things went wrong. Oh well....next time I&#39;ll remember to say &#39;No, Thank you&#39; and place my order through the cashier sitting in front of a computer."

I had the nihari burrito and it was very well done.  Nihari is basically cooked beef stew that is served with thick gravy with a side of ginger, onions and lime.  In this case, there is no gravy.  Its just the meat which is well done.  The roti wrapping was well done and had good consistency with the rest of the filling.  The basmati rice was light and fluffy and full of flavor. The masala fries weren&#39;t greasy at all and had good flavor which complimented the nihari burrito well.

I had a sip of the mango lassi which was very tasty and they give a decent portion of it. 

The staff was extremely friendly.  The owner is very kind, polite and professional and interacts very well with his customers.  He talked to us like a friend and was VERY hospitable. 

The decor of this place is nice and the place is kept very clean.  It has a nice cafe feel to it and you can choose to sit inside or out.  

I definitely recommend this place!"

I have tried some of each and they are all outstanding.

Where I think this place truly excels though, is in management.  Every time I have gone in, the same guy is there running the show.  He clearly knows what he is doing!

It was a new crepe/roti concept that really intrigued me.  So, FINALLY, I was able to come over to visit D&#39;licious Crepes and Roti in Bartlett! :)

This nice, quaint restaurant is nestled in the heart of Downtown Bartlett, right in front of  Bartlett Village Hall. :)  It is easy to get to from the Bartlett Metra Station which is mere steps away! :)

I was expecting a order from a menu on the wall, fast-casual place, but I was surprised we were asked to sit down and were given actual menus to order from.  The decor is modern, lots of dark woods and rattan chairs around the  dining area.  The cooler aspect of this place are the two crepe creation stations that patrons can come up to and watch their crepes being created before their eyes.  I love seeing food being made(teppanyaki cuisine comes to mind) in front of you and D&#39;licious Crepes and Roti does that for you!  

I brought my family along to try this place. My husband ordered the Beef Bourguignon special, which he said was awesome.  I ordered a paneer kathi roti and it was JUST as awesome I could barely tell it was cheese and not chicken! :) I will try the chicken one next time!

The flavors and spices really brought me to the Indian cuisine I had so longed for(I wish they had a vindaloo roti...ooh I don&#39;t mind the spicy. :)  But, not long after I had taken a trip to India that I was WHISKED AWAY to France with D&#39;licious Crepe and Roti&#39;s sweet CREPES. Now, crepes are a whole different thing there are both savory and sweet crepes.  My daughter tried one of their breakfast crepes and enjoyed it, but not as much as she enjoyed her Black and White(nutella and banana) crepe, she practically inhaled it! Although I was quite stuffed after my Paneer kathi roti, I shared a La Cacahuete (Peanut Butter, Nutella and Banana) crepe. OMG the Peanut Butter EXPLODED in my mouth coating it in creamy peanut buttery goodness! :)   My husband who helped me with my La Cacahuete was in agreement as we both love peanut butter. :)

The staff and owner of D&#39;licious Crepes and Roti were all very accommodating and helpful!  They had a lot of suggestions and were friendly.  We were very well thanked and well taken cared of on our first trip to their lovely establishment! 

Will I return? OH YOU BETCHA!!  I love crepes both savory and sweet!  Definitely check this place out if you are a crepe fanatic!! Or want something a little different than the dull and boring. :)

GO! NOW! Give D&#39;licious Crepes and Roti! You will NOT regret it!"

You know when a proprietor radiates pride and stops at every table checking in? This is such a place. Indian food or crepes is an interesting approach that worked well for us as a casual Saturday morning stop. Add quality food and unique options with affordable pricing and this is too notch. Add fancy coffee imported from the Netherlands Douwe Egberts and it&#39;s a real treat. Only area for improvement is while they have excellent quality products they may not be fantastic baristas yet. With a little practice I think they will master that too. Give this local place a try and enjoy the outdoor seating!

I&#39;ve heard about this French/Indian/Crepe place in Bartlett for quite some time and it always had good reviews.  I just couldn&#39;t get the concept.  Crepes, Indian, Gelato, Coffee, what kind of crazy mix up is that.

Well, last Friday night I couldn&#39;t figure out what to have for dinner and for some reason this place popped in my head.  The family was out of town, so I figured I&#39;ll just go and give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in and took a seat at the bar.  My order was taken (I had the Signature Ham and Cheese Crepe), figured I&#39;d start out with what they identified as one of their best.  It took a little bit for the food to come out, but watching them prepare the food I understood it was fresh and being made.  For that I will gladly wait and watch. I took my first bite, mind you most Crepe&#39;s I&#39;ve had were dessert based so i wasn&#39;t sure what to expect.  It was AMAZING, the bechamel sauce was wonderful.  The Crepe was great, the meat and cheese&#39;s had great flavors and all played wonderfully together.  I had to pace myself so I didn&#39;t look like a crazy guy woofing it down.

The next day on Saturday I kept thinking about the crepe and decided I had to try other options, so I used the Yelp Eat24 app to place a to go order.  Wanted to see how that worked anyhow.  This time I ordered the Butter Chicken Burrito, Samosa and 
Mascarpone Delight Crepe.  When I arrived they informed me they were running a bit behind but would have it ready shortly.  No big deal, I took a seat.  While I waited they brought me a glass of water and assured me the food would be ready shortly.  Then the owner came out and apolgized, offered me a free coffee.  I politely declined, but he insisted it would be good.  Why not, so he brought me an espresso with a little piece of chocolate on the side.  HOLY WOW, that espresso was good.  Creamy, Caramelly coffee goodness and the chocolate piece was great as well.  Anyhow, minutes later the food was ready.  I took my time finished the coffe and went home.  The food again was amazing, but I ordered more than I could actually eat.  Wrapped it up and the next day my wife finished off the Burrito.  A day old and slightly cold and she thought it was still amazing.

We&#39;ll be back soon to journey across the rest of the menu and check out the gelato next time.  So glad I decided to get past the idea of what a crazy combo this was and discovered a new wonderful place to eat in Bartlett."

We got the paneer roti with masala eggs and the paneer burrito. The flavors were good, and the prices reasonable. I&#39;ve had way better Kati rolls in NYC, so this was kinda of a let down. The burrito was supposed to have spinach in it but it was pretty scarce.

Also decided to share a dessert crêpe, the strawberry &amp; Nutella. Again I&#39;ve definitely had much better elsewhere.

Was looking for a quick, unique, vegetarian-friendly dinner spot and we found it! Great service, friendly/accomadating owner, unique, fresh, food! 4 of us and we split two &#34;burritos&#34;, two dessert crepes, a masala fry and requested for the tater tots to be made bombay masala- called them roshni tots and glad we did, it was delish!!! if in the area, will be back!

Gave 4 stars... the burrito shell is a little soggy (was supposed to be) and wasnt fan of the rice... would of preferred a lentil option and some spicier chutneys..  but loved the concept amd fusion!"

Right when I walked in I was greeted by the owner. He has unbelievable service. He has a very calming demeanor if that makes sense. He made me want to stay, though I insisted on taking it to go. It is in a strip mall next to a liquor store and a pizza place. I imagined it being more like a moderately fast food place like panera or something. They seat you, and you have a server. It is very clean, and I would like to try many items on the menu. I am going to try the beef burrito and the lemon crepe. Both have names I dont remember at the moment.

We ended up taking the BYOB option and enjoyed a bottle of wine (ok, I fess up, we had 2 bottles of wine) with dinner. We are looking forward to trying the gelato on a future visit and are thrilled to have an option like this right in downtown Bartlett.

I seen a lot of good reviews here and the pictures looked very appealing. So today in a winter storm, my family and I decided to walk and give it a try. 
    
When we came in the restaurant, there was only a woman and her three daughters. It wasn&#39;t a surprise seeing the place empty because of the bad weather. Anyway, the owner greeted us very friendly and we took our seat, and right after he asked for the drinks we wanted to get, I asked for tea, and he recommended the lime with agave, so I ordered that one, and it was really good! My dad order hot chocolate and my mom ordered decaf coffee. 

As for the food, my dad order a chipotle chicken crepe, my mom the beef burrito, and me, I ordered the chicken tikka burrito. All I have to say that the name of the restaurant says it all. &#34;DELICIOUS!&#34; It was something new for us and I personally loved every bite of it. Now, in a restaurant the food can be really good, but what I think makes a great 5 star restaurant which I have this, it&#39;s the service. I really felt valued as a customer by the owner. He really cares about his customers and the community. 

I would definitely go back to this place specially to try the black and white crepes which I had no more room to eat. 

Excellent experience overall!"

I have been subject to dining in Bartlett the past 14 years. For those like me who have suffered out here, we are glad that a real restaurant opened up in our town.

1. Owner prides himself on excellence in customer service
2. He serves real freshly prepared food
3. Overall, very clean, polite staff, ample parking, wide variety menu.

So if you are interested in eating real food in an actual restaurant. Then dine here :)

Specifics:
Ordered the burrito roti sandwiches, they make their own roti (so you are not getting the packaged bread.)"

Delicious, inexpensive, ample parking, friendly staff, and free coffee. I was quite happy that I got to visit this place for lunch before leaving town after Christmas. I was surprised to see so many 5 star reviews for a new place so it had to be good. This is located off the strip mall in downtown Bartlett. You can park in front, around the side, or even in back. The store itself is smaller, goes with the cafe feel of the restaurant. The owner was present and was super nice when he saw our large group &#34;5 people is large considering most of the tables are for two&#34; and he had the waitress move two tables together. They were quick to get the orders and provide a cup of the small coffee. The coffee itself is good (Douwe Egberts Coffee (Netherlands) but it does come from a machine that likely mixed coffee powder with water, but hey free is free. I had the rumali roti chicken tikka burrito for 6 dollars. It had ample amount of tandoori chicken, the right amount of kick/spiciness with garbanzo beans and tamarind. The mint yogurt side decreased the heat when needed. It was cooked well and wrapped in roti. If they had a chicken mahani wrap it maybe even better just a FYI if the owner is paying attention, but for that price it is equivalent to chiptole and can give them a run for the money. The banana/nutella crepe for dessert was delicious. I have never been to France so I can&#39;t compare to it, but I have had Magic Pan the LEYE restaurant and it is comparable. Ample banana and nutella in a fresh made crepe. Overall great experience. I hope the friendly owner keeps up with the wonderful service. Based on that we are sold and will come again!

Pros: Free coffee small, only 1 dollar if you want a large. Fresh made crepes. Good prices and portion size. Unique dining experience, get to this place before it gets too busy!

Cons: Limited hours, small seating area, food prep takes a while after your order but that is the price you pay for good food

We visited this place in route from Madison to Wheaton to see a show. We had no idea that we walked in a half hour after they closed. Incredibly embarrassed that we walked in after closing, we tried to apologetically walk out. However, the very kind owner insisted that we not only order some food, but stay in to eat it. We really did not want to impose and tried to respect the closing time, but the staff all urged us to stay. 

We decided to go ahead and order. We were offered free coffee while we waited for our order to be made. They give free coffee out to all who want it...regardless of whether you order food or not. And, the coffee is actually really good! The food is made right in front of you so both my boys were highly entertained watching the owner make their strawberry and nutella crepes right before their eyes. They both devoured their crepes! We also ordered the buffalo chicken crepe and the roti burrito. The kick of the buffalo chicken burrito was a nice touch to the natural slight sweetness of the crepe. It was a great combination. The roti burrito was, by far, my favorite. I&#39;m in love with the concept of putting Indian flavors into a burrito style wrap. 

A few of the staff and the owner all checked in on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. They went above and beyond any restaurant I have ever been to. The service was excellent. The food was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place to anybody rolling through the area and looking for a bite to eat."

Having searched around and read reviews, I decided to give it a go. I was blown away! My go to is a thin cheese with garlic buttercrust, and sometimes I will throw bacon on it.

The crust is nice and thin and has a fantastic cracker - like crunch to it. The cheese is decent, but the parmesan and oregano seasoning adds the necessary flavor.

The staff seems to be one close family. They are always friendly, honest and sincere. On my second pickup, they burnt my pizza. I work in the industry, so I understand these things happen. The cashier told me right away, told me about how long it would be, offered a larger size at no additional cost and offered a drink while I waited. Mistakes happen and how they recovered was pretty much textbook, leaving me as satisfied as i would have been without an error.

Basically, this place is doing it right in all departments."

So, my mistake, I accidentally called Palatine and not the Elk Grove location like I intended. (I could walk to the Elk Grove location from my home if I wanted.) I show up at the Elk Grove location to pick up my order and was given a kind but quizzical look from the cashier. She asked if I could have possibly ordered from the Palatine location (which I didn&#39;t even know they had). She immediately called the palatine location to confirm my order. She was more than helpful by also getting the address and Google mapping it to let me know how long it would take to get there from Elk Grove. After learning it would be a 17 min ride I was very hesitant about having to drive 40 mins round trip to get the pizzas. The palatine store offered to deliver them and I graciously accepted! They must have left right then &amp; there because my pizzas were at my door in almost exactly 20mins. To top it off the driver apologized and was thanking ME for allowing them to deliver the pizzas and was refusing my tip to boot!

For me the items and its taste if I would like to visit again or not. I had lunch buffet as my friend took me there if I like to have South Indian food. Non-veg items are less compared to veg items. Pooris are very hard. We call it poori when it gets puffed but the ones we had are like flat, hard tacos. I didn&#39;t liked the appetizer as well it was cut mirchi. Pongal and sambhar were good. Desserts were nice. 

Overall for the price doesn&#39;t worth the quality of the food."

For that same amount of buffet price, you can get good brunch at a trendy downtown spot. Why go to such a dingy Indian place with terrible service if they are not even cheap enough!! 
On a busy weekend lunch time, their only restroom was out of order! That is completely unacceptable, why can&#39;t they call an emergency plumber? Probably trying save a few pennies by waiting till weekday which is ridiculous. They should have atleast offered me a discount after I pointed out. Even a dunkin donut or Subway has a working restroom, so this place is even below those. 
Food was blah, buffet plates were never replenished, all dishes had same kind of flavor. They ran out of  plates, and only had styrofoam paper plates, again reeking of consistently bad quality."

Dakshin is a Tamil restaurant. Everyone from the cooks to the wait staff speak Tamil. Parota being a tamil/Kerala dish, I decided to give it a shot. I had dined here earlier about a year ago and the food was about par. I had had biryani, which is not a Tamil dish. On the second chance they have really messed up. 

On a weekday night, while only one other table was occupied, it took them 35 minutes to get the food out. The waiter brought my food boxed to go, while I was dining in. This is a minor inconvenience if the food was good. 

Parota is a soft bread made from maida. The one they served was a wheat roti, which was hard and broke like papad. Would have been okay with it, had it been tasty and well cooked. A lot of indian restaurants use frozen parota, but at least make some effort to get a good quality one and disguise it. This one a blatant poor effort. 

Sorry, but won&#39;t go back."

So, let me start off by saying there was less of appetizers and bread; in appetizers only onion pakora was there, not sure if I would call idli manchurian as entree or appetizer, though that looked pretty exotic - don&#39;t think that is authentic south indian, but that tasted fine though, in non-veg - there was thai prawn which were good, well cooked. Poori was the only bread item, my only complaint was that they should have had one more bread item - roti/chappathi or naan or something because there was a lot of masala to choose from.
Tiffin items - these were all really really good - Poori to be eaten with Aloo Masala, onion uthappam and ven pongal - to be eaten with Sambar and variety of chutneys to choose from. Variety of entree masala - Kadai Paneer, some mushroom curry, some poriyal (dry), vegetable masala (coconut based - white in color). Non veg ones - chicken masala, goat masala. 
Rice Items - Tomato rice, Fried rice and plain rice. Goat Briyani in the non-veg section.
Desserts - Ladoo, Mango Kulfi (in a hotpack - so dont miss it), gulab jamun and carrot payasam. Obviously all the desserts were good - gulab jamun definitely by far the best one I have had among other Indian joints.

Items which definitely deserve a mention: 
(a) Ven Pongal and Oothapam - the best that I have tasted among maybe close to 6 Indian restaurants I have gone. 
(b) Chicken Masala - Oh my god I can just live everyday on that (as long as I have some bread item with it)
(c)  Carrot Payasam - wow. That was too good.

Weekend Lunch if you want to go somewhere with good quality South indian Food, this is the place to be. I mean the only thing place is small, so might want to get there a little early, we reached there today only at 1 pm, I thought it was fine."

The idli and sambhar are generally my taste-test of the kitchen team&#39;s skill and overall food&#39;s freshness - and both earned high points!

Their hakka noodles and manchurian were good too (although I will say I don&#39;t recommend ordering both South Indian dishes as well as Indian-Chinese for the same meal due to very different styles/ flavors) and I&#39;d like to especially note that their dishes were less oily than general.

The menu took a long time to decipher, its not very well organized.  I was like &#34;why have we come to a vegetarian restaurant&#34;. But then I realized that my girlfriend had an extra page than mine, thats where all the non-veg stuff was and I was missing that page. Usually, to grade Indian restaurants based on how good their &#34;butter chicken&#34; is because that is my most favorite thing ever. It was good but ordinary. Nothing special. We had samosas for appetizer which seemed like they were the frozen kind and they just warmed it up in the oven. 

My gf loved the mango lassi but I didnt think it was that special, the consistency felt weird for some reason. 

We also had gulab jamun for dessert. This time my gf hated it but i thought it was ok. Definitely better than what you get at the various India Houses. The syrup was actual sugar syrup (thick) not just some watered down crap. The balls themselves felt like they had a thick exterior and a soft interior which is very weird for gulab jamun, I feel.

I guess we should have come here and eaten South Indian food. Thats what this place is known for. But like I said, I like to use the Butter Chicken barometer to test a place out. My recommendation, skip this go to Thumka on Higgins and Barrington. Thumka has wayyy better food, IMHO. Thumka also has awesome, awesome south indian food."

Their weekday buffets costing under $10 for all you can eat is very tasty, however the number of dishes is less. The quality of them is very good.

They have the best Avial (a Coconut and yougurt based Veg Stew) out side Chennai. The veg Kottu Parota (they have a Chicken variety too), is amazing, we usually have them everytime we go there.

The waitress are good and speak (apart from English), Telegu and Tamil. They have very good dosa.

Their&#39;s thali is very good and they allow folks to pack the subzi as take away.


Now coming on to the not so good stuff

The place is very cramped and small and the dishes are a bit expensive considering the overall dinning experience.

It gets crowded very fast on weekends and tends to be a lot noisy.

Thats not the best part. I had too many dosas and curries and I thought I will eat one gulab jamun that was freshly brought to the counters. I took one. It was freaking piping hot, soft and delicious. One of my friends described them as &#34;eating them feels like I am in heaven&#34;. The mango ice cream (custard) was awesome too.

Might go there just for the gulab jamus alone."

I have been in US for a while now and i can bet that i have tried almost all Indian restaurants in Schaumburg area.

I&#39;m picky when it comes to home-style food, but this place really gets it right every single time. (Atleast all the times I&#39;ve been there!)

You could call it a hole-in-the-wall joint, it isn&#39;t too fancy. But the food more than makes up for it. Spicy rasam, delicious pulavs, little round utappams, fresh onion pakoras. And the star of the show &#39;Thayir Sadam&#39;.  The last time I went here, I had three (yes, three) servings of just that after a few servings of the other stuff. It melts in your mouth.  For the uninitiated: &#39;Thayir Sadam&#39; is a buttery mix of rice and yogurt, seasoned with mustard seeds, chilies and cilantro. You have it with pickled mangoes, and then you go to heaven :)

This used to be a vegetarian joint until a year ago, and now they have some non-vegetarian options as well. I couldn&#39;t tell you what they taste like, but if my vegetarian half of the table is anything to go by, the meat must rock too."

I have no idea why one reviewer said that the thali/ a la carte is not good--they probably came in on an off-day. While the South Indian thali is likely to offer you a somewhat variable experience every time, it is almost always pretty decent. Again, if you have a sense of how Tamil food is, you&#39;ll enjoy the variety of items. They have a killer mor kuzhambu, avial and poriyal. The chapathi is typically South Indian --big and more like a plain paratha than a phulka. 

A la carte--the dosas, the sambar vadai and even the chapathi-kurma are pretty good. Again, I come here because it vaguely reminds me of my college days when I would go to the local hotel and wash down some hot and inexpensive South Indian &#34;tiffin&#34; with some filter coffee. (The coffee too was pretty decent the last time I had it but I can&#39;t vouch for it!).

I&#39;ve tried the buffet only once (again, a stellar mor kuzhambu and poriyals, i.e. Tamil veggie curries) but I&#39;ve never dared to really try the North Indian/ Punjabi dishes.

It was time for another trek through the barren wasteland of  Schaumburgian strip malls and this time I stumbled across a Southern Indian gem.  Dakshin isn&#39;t much to look at from the outside and the interior isn&#39;t likely to win any architectural awards, but the food is delicious, diverse, and comforting - the perfect recipe for a cold day and priced just right at about $9 for the lunch buffet.   

Vegetarian entrees dominate here, but they are so tasty that even my inner carnivore was silenced.  Hits include the coconut rice, aloo saag, bhindi masala, cabbage poriyal, and the incredible dosas.  On a separate table there were two halal meat dishes of goat curry and chili chicken.  Chili chicken?  Yes, they also serve Indian - Chinese food!  If you&#39;ve never tried tandoori chicken fried rice before, you are missing out.  

Bottom line: Dakshin provides a perfect primer to southern Indian, northern Indian, and Indian-Chinese cuisine at reasonable prices."

Unlimited dosa is brought to your table. The best part of the buffet is the unlimited dosa with coconut and tomato chutney. It tasted excellent and authentic. The chinese fried rice was also awesome. There was a chinese mixed vegatable curry which tasted ok. The gulab jamun for dessert was warm, soft and excellent. So was the curd rice.  The south Indian dishes were a disappointment.  The pakodis were not crisp and the oil used smelled weird. The gutthonkaya curry was bland and there were hardly any vonkayas to be found. The sambar seemed old and did not appeal to my tastebuds. There were two other curries which seemed to be left overs and I did not touch them. The naan was not hot and not crispy, and appeared to have been done in a hurry.

The menu is fairly simple- mainly featuring the soon do boo - korean tofu soup.  In the feature for ~$11 - you get an assortment of korean side dishes (panchan) kimchee cabbage, kimchee radish, sweet beans, marinated bean sprouts, pickled cucumber.  Rice in a hot stone bowl - which leaves a nice flavorful crisp crust of rice as it contacts the hot stone bowl.  You&#39;re suppose to scoop out the rice leaving the crackle rice - add in a bit of tea to release the crispy rice.  This transforms into a good &#34;rice soup&#34; as you get the flavor of the crusty rice.  The soup is served absolutely bubbling hot - your choice of spice - get ready to sweat if you choose higher than mild.  I had kimchee beef this time - and it was what I would expect.  (Since you get free kimchee anyway - maybe I should have just ordered &#34;beef&#34;.  

spicy scale as determined by sweat:
Mild - oh tofu soup - its missing something...where&#39;s the spice?
Hot - I need a hankerchief please..
Very spicy:  where&#39;s the A/C? - and why is the water refill taking so long?

We ordered Kalbi as well - which was drier than I&#39;m used to.  The bulgogi did not wow or impress.  

This restaurant is known for the soups which was good - and EVERY table in the restaurant had at least one bowl of soup.  

Service is good - they got my order corrected really fast when they realised that I did not order the combo - just the soup.  If you order the &#34;combo&#34; you get a smaller bowl of soup with a platter or beef (either kalbi short rib or bulgogi marinated sliced beef with onions) - neither platter was sizzling when arrived at table - so I imagine the iron platter was for show.  

I would not make a trek out specifically for Cho Dang, but if it was along the way and I had my korean soup craving - I wouldnt mind stopping by,"

You can get it at the level of spiciness that you want -- I typically get it &#34;botong&#34; which means regular spicy level. When it gets spicier than that, your lips and tongue get numb and you can&#39;t taste the food. Now you don&#39;t want that, do you?

I don&#39;t really ever want to eat soondooboo. I don&#39;t even order it at restaurants, so me wanting to come here is huge.

Anyway I came here with 2 other people. We got 4 orders of modeum soondooboo (which has a little of everything), 1 mild, 2 spicy, 1 spicy to go, and an order of steamed dumplings.

Each order comes with dolsot rice (stone bowl rice) that you scoop all the rice out of and let the bottom layer of rice crisp up from the heat in the stone pot. Then you pour water into the still hot pot and let it turn into kinda like a porridge. It&#39;s really good. 

Also, each order comes with a raw egg that you crack into your soup while it&#39;s still boiling. The residual heat cooks the egg perfectly. My yolk was still a little raw, which is exactly how I like it. 

The banchan was all delicious and very refreshing since the soondooboo and rice were incredibly hot (in temperature). The soondooboo had a lot of flavor, more than others that I&#39;ve tried. I liked it a lot. There was a generous portion of other things inside too. There was shrimp, mussels, clam, beef. I ordered the spicy and it wasn&#39;t too spicy. 

The steamed dumplings were not homemade. I was not impressed with them. I probably won&#39;t order those again.

My main complaint is with the service. Our server had such an attitude. She was flinging our side dish plates. She tried to put the bubbling soondooboo between us which I thought was dangerous. I don&#39;t think she even understood half the things we were saying... 

There was also a manager/owner there. She was great. 

So even though the service sucked, I&#39;d still come back because of the food. I want to try their curry soondooboo!"

I&#39;m not a big soup person and their menu is mostly all soup with just a couple of exceptions - Bulgoki aka grilled marinated beef (which you can get on its own &amp; is pricey or in a combo with the tofu soup but that&#39;s a heck of a lot of food) ---and their newest item Bi Bim Bap aka mixed rice!

I really enjoy the Bi Bam Bap served at Chodang along with all of the ban chans (aka little starter side dishes). We were served 5 banchans at Chodang are all quite tasty with the standards of kimchi (fermented veggies), Kongnamul (bean sprouts), some kind of cucumber namul, some veggie covered in gochujang (chili pepper paste), and a red bean banchan - plus a bowl of eggs. 

After picking at the banchan a bit, my lunch crew and I received our main dishes quite quickly. I was the only non-soup getter and it was fun teaching our coworkers about the various ingredients they were eating &amp; the way to eat it all. The bi bim bap comes out in a stone dish just like the soups and quite hot. Now I wanted one of the eggs in my bi bim bap to be a bit cooked (but you could just put it in raw) so I immediately transferred all rice to the other bowl &amp; cracked open the egg over the stone pot so it could cook in there...yes the bowl is that hot. While that is cooking, I mixed my ingredients a bit. The idea here is to mix up everything really well, adding some spice however I&#39;m a weirdo that prefers the least amount of mixing as is possible so that&#39;s how I did it. 

Also, let that rice that sticks to the edges of the bowl just sit there getting crispy. Then you add a little water and eat that up. Nomz. 

Back to the bi bim bap, the bi bim bap here has a whole mess of ingredients - enoki &amp; 2 other kinds of mushrooms, sesame seasoned carrots, cucumber &amp; bean sprouts, and ground chicken. Everything was so friggin delicious with the egg &amp; rice in there. I&#39;m usually can&#39;t handle much spice but I feel like bibimbap needs a bit of kick to it so spread it all over giving it a nice reddish tint.  It&#39;s a huge portion but I&#39;m a beast and I ate it all.

It gets packed to the brim during weekday lunches so try to get their as early as possible to ensure you get a seat. And be careful while waiting! The servers are carrying scolding (seriously a million degrees) bowls of bubbling soup very quickly, weaving around people. One false move and it could be a disaster!"

I forgot who told me about this place, but man was I skeptical. Chicago has, probably, the worst Korean food on the planet, which always completely baffles me, considering that there&#39;s a decent Korean population here. I don&#39;t know if my taste buds have &#34;grown up&#34; since then, but I remember back in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s Korean food was pretty good over on Lawrence Ave. in Chicago, but many of those owners, after being in business for 15-20 years, closed shop in the late 90&#39;s and retired to Northbrook. Now, we have small pockets of Koreans here &#39;n&#39; there, and the food is just awful! Usually soon tofu is one of the biggest offenders, so when I heard that there&#39;s a place like BCD in Arlington Heights, I completely dismissed it.

SOON TOFU
For those that don&#39;t know, this is basically soft tofu in a spicy stew with meat (typically beef and seafood mixed) served while it&#39;s still boiling in its hot stone bowl. You eat it with rice and whatever banchan (side dishes) come out. Also for those that don&#39;t know, BCD is a small chain (that wisely stays away from Chicago, lest it be tainted) that specializes in soon tofu and has many locations in the LA area. BCD used to be my favorite soon tofu until I discovered Koba in Irvine. I bring up this backstory, because remember, someone told me that this was &#34;just like BCD!&#34; Really? They&#39;re going to pair my once favorite soon tofu place with an Arlington Heights hole in the wall?

Though I maintain that I was still right in being skeptical, I was very pleasantly surprised! BCD&#39;s Koreatown location in LA tastes much better than its LA suburbs counterparts, but there was one BCD location that suffered the most, and that was Garden Grove, CA. I would put Chodang&#39;s soon tofu a notch below BCD Garden Grove!

There was actually flavor in the soon tofu! It wasn&#39;t watery or just milky looking, it was a thick stew and was packed with flavor! I asked for extra spicy, and just like BCD and unlike Koba, it just tastes like their standard soon tofu + more peppers. It tastes more like just an add on instead of infusing with it. Soon Tofu&#39;s flavors need to be very confident if you&#39;re going to drop an egg in there, and surprisingly, Chodang&#39;s soon tofu was still pretty good after! The seasoning suffers the most with the egg, but it also was resilient. That all being said, I think if you skip the egg, Chodang&#39;s soon tofu could be on par with GG BCD. Final word: Best soon tofu in Chicago!

KALBI
Many soon tofu places have a kalbi combo where the soon tofu is a little smaller, but you get a side of kalbi. Chicago has the worst KBBQ too, so I was skeptical about this as well. Surprisingly, it was pretty tasty! The marinade was spot on, sweet and salty, but I think it could have been smokier. The rib was also a bit too fatty on some. I usually eat all the meat off the bone in LA, but the quality isn&#39;t as high here for me to do that. It&#39;s good, but I would probably save money and just get the soon tofu.

NENGMYUN
Terrible. They serve it with kimchi in it already (and a watermelon slice), and their kimchi sauce sucks. It&#39;s too sour, fermented, and strong and it doesn&#39;t taste like nengmyun + kimchi, it just tastes like kimchi. Yuck!

BIBIMBAP
Run of the mill. Nothing special.

CHO-DAAAANG!
Their soon tofu brings them into the company of a very few Chicago restaurants that can hang with LA. That is saying something! The other 2 are Cho Sun Ok and New Seoul - which is in Arlington Heights also. Congrats!"

Normally we go to Tofu Village in Naperville so we decided to give this place a try.
They started with the standard small plates of &#34;appetizers&#34; - they give you 5. They were fresh but I was surprised as you get much more in Naperville.
The menu is more limited than tofu village in Naperville.
My tofu and veggie dumpling soup was good.
My daughter ordered steamed dumplings and she ate them all.

The hardest part about finding it though is...how do you spell it? Soondubu, soon dubu,  sundubu, soon tofu...

Anyway, for some reason it&#39;s hard to find this stuff in the city unless you&#39;re in the outskirts or the suburbs. Oh there&#39;s options for Korean fried chicken or Korean barbecue, but not a black bowl of lava and bean curd.

Chodang is the perfect place to warm up with a deceptively filling bowl of tofu soup, crisped up rice, and your usual suspects of random bites of banchan. The soup comes out piping hot but very flavorful and rich, and my seafood version had a good amount of clams, shrimp, and more. I didn&#39;t find their spicy version that spicy at all so next time I&#39;ll try to go for the highest level they&#39;ve got.

It&#39;s not a super fancy place, but it&#39;s not too pricy either. It&#39;d be a hidden gem if not for Yelp. It&#39;s the perfect spot for when you just want to warm up and pig out while watching out for first degree burns."

My favorite part is the rice served in the hot stone bowl.  You scoop out the rice into as separate bowl and as you eat your meal, the layer of rice left on the stone bowl will crisp up.  I like to pry off the rice and dip it in my left over soup at the end of the meal.  This isn&#39;t commonly found at the Korean restaurants around this area.  Another great bonus is that they are very accommodating to the spice level you want.  So go as mild or as spicy as your palette will enjoy!

If you are looking for Korean BBQ, you will find some items but they come out pre-cooked so it isn&#39;t the cook while you eat experience.  But definitely A+++ if you are looking for hot comfort soup!  FYI - they give you and egg to crack into your hot boiling soup!"

Ever since I introduced my boyfriend to this place, we&#39;ve been coming here religiously even all the way from downtown. I always get the pork tofu soup, extra spicy. He gets the seafood tofu soup, extra spicy. Recently, I&#39;ve been getting the &#34;combo 1&#34; where I get a smaller portion of the tofu soup with a side of Korean bbq. This is perfect for me since I can&#39;t finish the soup and it allows us to share some korean bbq. We often get the steamed dumplings as well which is consistently great. There banchan (side dishes) are always on point. So fresh so good.

As a tofu soup newby, I didn&#39;t really know what I was eating, but it was fantastic.  First they bring you five or six little side dishes. One had pickled seaweed, another was bean sprouts, and a third had an uncooked egg (in the shell).  I picked at the side dishes, all were wonderful, until my stone bowl of boiling hot soup arrived.  The soup is a broth base with a special kind of super-silken Korean tofu drizzled into it so that it looks a lot like egg drop soup.  You order it either vegetarian style, or with your choice of meats or seafood.  I had beef.  

As soon as your soup comes, you are supposed to crack your raw egg into it and mix that up to both cook the egg while at the same time cooling off the boiling soup.  Then you just enjoy the soup.  They also bring you a personal bowl of hot rice, which has gotten nicely crunchy around the edges.  Watching the other people eat their soup (I was the only non-Asian in the restaurant), it looked like they ate the rice separately from the soup, so i did the same, even though I was dying to dump a little in the broth to let it soak up the flavor.  

I am gluten free and although I didn&#39;t ask about the ingredients, i had no bad side effects from eating the soup and sides.  Everything was fantastic.  I can&#39;t wait to come here again."

I was meeting up with some old friends, and they decided to hit this place up. My wife won&#39;t go anywhere near tofu, so she subsisted on dumplings. I, being the adventurous eater, got the baby octopus bowl.

If you decide to eat here, the presentation and service of the food is something else. A variety of pickled vegetables (cucumbers, onions, carrots) is served on the side. White rice is served in a heavy, hot stone bowl that would make for a good mortar. The rice browns and crisps up. It ends up going great with the brothy tofu. Helpfully, the menu gives you directions on how to make all this work. :-)

The octopus was pretty tender. It was spicier than I expected it to be, so I was thankful for the rice (and, honestly, could have used a bit more!) But on the whole, it was highly flavorful and had varied textures--which fits the bill for what I look for in a Chinese restaurant. 

Even my toddler devoured the spicy tofu, which was a pleasant surprise.

You get a choice of your spiciness value (white, mild, regular, hot, and very hot) - I always get the hot or the very hot.  I always get number 5, which is the kimchi soondooboo, which comes with kimchi and beef.  This comes with another bowl of steamed rice with dried peas on top (love those peas!), in which you scoop all the rice in the silver rice bowl they give you, and pour cold/warm water into the initial bowl in order to get all the good burnt rice bits up.  You save this for later.  Now, you focus on your tofu soup, in which you crack the raw egg in (the extreme high temperature of it will cook the egg, so don&#39;t worry), and then you put rice in, and eat with the banchan they give you - I love eating it with the black sweet beans that&#39;s covered in soy sauce and sesame seeds.  The pickled pickle slices are great, too.  Once you finish your soondooboo, focus on the other bowl of rice that you poured water into.  Scrape all the rice bits up, and then eat the rest of your side dishes with it.  It&#39;s great!  It&#39;s refreshing, and a great way to finish up your meal.

The east part (left) of the parking lot of the restaurant should be avoided. You can easily find yourself in a bind when parking is unavailable. Parking at the west part (right) of the lot is recommended.

I came in during lunch time around noon. I believe it would be best to come 5-10 minutes before as there is a lunch rush. The restaurant is cozy and the servers are very attentive. All the sundubu options are listed for $10 which is pretty reasonable. In LA it is same price, but the banchan is more extensive. The banchan at Cho Dang is pretty limited. I think they only give like 4? A place like BCD Tofu House provides about 8-10, which includes a small deep fried fish. But that&#39;s LA and BCD can be called a chain restaurant. Since this is mom and pop restaurant and it&#39;s the Northwest suburbs of Chicago I will not hold it against them lol.

I know many people love this place due to their soondoobu... however to me.. it&#39;s just a-ok.. maybe because I&#39;ve had better...It is the best I&#39;ve tried so far in Chicago though...

Food:
Soondoobu (~9.99) - they have different soondoobu soup options which ranges from seafood, beef, kimchee, mandoo..etc and you also can choose how spicy you want the soup to be...I usually just get the spicy one..but if you are not good at handling spicy food... you might want to order the non-spicy food...

**they also have combos for around $18.99 that comes with soondoobu and kalbi (short ribs).....

if you order the spicy soondoobu soup.. expect your eyes to water.. and for your nose to drip (JK.. or maybe not).. spicy + hot soup might do that to you... also be careful when eating because you might burn your tongue or roof of your mouth if your try to eat it very fast.. yes it is really really hot (heat)...even the rice is that hot...

Side Dishes &#34;Banchan&#34; (free with meal) - I think they should improve the quality of the side dishes because there&#39;s not much variety and quality of them are bleh...

Costs: they keep increasing the price and decreasing the quality or amount of shrimp in the seafood soup.. it&#39;s around $11 (including tax) per person if you order soondoobu...and try to bring cash if you can because sometimes they don&#39;t allow you to split credit cards...

Customer Service:  NOT GOOD...I think most customers are aware of that but they go just for the food... sometimes slow.. and sometimes there&#39;s this one mean thin lady that works there.. her impression just looks like she has an attitude.. not sure if she still works there though...

I&#39;m a &#34;regular&#34; here because my friends love this place.. especially the out of towners..I personally wouldn&#39;t come here.. unless maybe I was craving a hot spicy soup because I was sick... I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll help in curing you somewhat..."

if you want soon dubu, come here. I usually get the kimchi&amp;meat one, spice level 3, 4 if i&#39;m feeling adventurous. then when the food arrives, I take extra care not to burn myself on the rice bowl (a common problem, it is the korean version of the cornballer from arrested development).

then I take a spoon of rice and dip it in the soon dubu and eat it. I repeat this until I am done. Sometimes I drink some water.

The panchans are a bit meager, but they oddly grow on you. I now love the marinated bean sprouts and find their &#34;plain&#34;ness a great contrast to the spice/flavor of the soup. and the beans, they are magic beans because they are delicious. also because if you plant them, they grow overnight.

the other non-soon dubu options are ok too, but really it&#39;s like going to a sushi place and ordering chicken teriyaki (something I have done before). it might be good, but why are you there, then?

With fall rolling around and winter after that, I look forward to the warm embrace of chodang tofu village. They should change their name to Chodang Tofu Thrillage, because it is so exciting."

I recently tried their dumplings which are super tender and their bulgogi is pretty good in my opinion. I also really like every single one of their pan chan: top picks include the cucumbers and the soybeans

My extraordinarily picky auntie who grew up in Korea even rh enjoys this place, begrudgingly admitting that it&#39;s just as good (or better) at Chodang as it is in Korea. If that&#39;s not a raving endorsement I don&#39;t know what is."

Normally I&#39;m indifferent about tofu but I do have soft spot for all things specially made. This place turned out to be great. 

I had the:

Beef and seafood tofu soup: Damn that was good! Comes boiling hot and you crack a raw egg in it which cooks by the time it cools enough to eat. It was fantastic. The side dishes were all pretty tasty too except for one that looks like natto. (See pictures.) 

It also comes with a bowl of rice in a super hot stone bowl which cooks the rice on the sides into a crispy crackery thing. You can pick it off and add it to the soup for texture which I thought was neat. 

The soup itself was very tasty, their house made tofu in it was incredibly soft and silky like eating air and there are pieces beef or seafood or egg with every bite.  You can have it as spicy as you want it too. I would say this dish is perfect for a cold day as everything comes out sizzling hot. 

Overall this place is delivers on its name TOFU. House made and silky smooth. The staff is a bunch of friendly middle aged Korean ladies and the atmosphere is comfortable. If you&#39;re a fan of soup or just Korean food in general get over here now!"

For $10, it&#39;s enough food for 2-3 meals.  And don&#39;t forget to pour water in your empty rice bowl, so you can scrape off the crispy, burnt rice - like fresh rice crackers!  A minimalist meal at its best!  Just don&#39;t burn yourself."

But if for whatever reason I am craving some, I will definitely be coming back to Cho-Dang.

Their Soon-Tofu is spicy enough to make you sweat but not so spicy so that you can&#39;t taste the other ingredients. Their tofu is very fresh and soft and they do not hold back when filling their pot with seafood or meat. Plus, the experience of eating 2 meals in one sitting makes you feel like you get so much more for your money.

What am I talking about? When the rice comes out, you get to take the rice out into another bowl while pieces of the rice get stuck to the original hot bowl that the rice comes out in. You pour water into this hot bowl and it creates something called &#34;Noo-roong Ji&#34; which is like overcooked rice. It sounds kind of gross if you&#39;ve never had it before but it is a great way to finish any meal. This may sound a little confusing, but you&#39;ll understand if you visit.

Maybe that&#39;s because I live in Boston now, where Korean food is...well...yeah, not even close.

BUT while visiting a friend in Chicago, I followed her to Chodang Tofu, and I found that in the randomest of places (Illinois??), a real authentically Korean restaurant DOES exist! Wish they could expand to Boston...

What I noticed in a nutshell:

1. Rice in iron-cast pots. What. Haven&#39;t seen these even in Korea, but somehow the rice tastes soooo good in them! Makes me wish I had one at home. (Funfact the restaurant owner told me: apparently opening restaurants are not allowed to carry these pots, but because Chodang opened 15 years ago, they get to keep theirs. You know what that means--best rice = Chodang rice.)

2. The sweet bean sidedish. I&#39;m used to blackbeans, but this place uses redbeans. A first for me, the Seoulite from Korea. I&#39;m beginning to wonder if I&#39;ve just had the bad luck of missing all the great restaurants in Korea...

3. The galbi (beef): not too sweet, not too salty. perfect. Reminded me of home :)

4. The ambiance was light, which is a personal preference of mine (I like to see what I eat, thankyouverymuch). They recently overhauled their décor, and I really appreciated the yellow/green happy feeling it gave. (Btw, the pea mascot is so cute.)

If I ever go back to Illinois, I&#39;m hitting this place up. It&#39;s worth every penny. 
Although judging by the bustling crowd that was there past the lunch hour (we&#39;d gone at 2:30), maybe Chodang will come to me? I hope so~"

For dinner I had the Beef Tofu soup made very spicy. It also comes with ride and Kimchi. First thing is the soup here is served hot, comes out at a rapid boil in a bowel that keeps it hot. The rice is also served piping hot in a metal bowel that actually cooks the rice on the  edges so it gets crispy. The soup has a generous amount of tofu and is perfectly spiced.

The broth is so nice and thick and flavorful -- perfect for a cold Chicago winter&#39;s day.  The seafood included a clam or two, 3 shrimps, and a mussel out of the shell.  I wish there was some squid in there too.

Apparently, there is a proper way to eat the rice before it gets too burnt up (making it into a sort of congee).  But I delight in the crispy rice so I&#39;m pretty sure I got a few disapproving glances from the Koreans, while I loudly scraped at the sides of my stone bowl.

They are the only one that exists.  This is often a popular lunch spot for the Koreans who work in the local freight forwarding community and has attracted many other guests as well.  

I usually get the sukum which has a little bit of everything and love eating the rice served in hot stone bowls.  The remaining hardened rice stuck to eh stone bowl can be easily extracted with the water provided and is a delicious and savory treat that Koreans enjoy.

If this is your first time eating soondubu then beware of the extremely hot boiling soup that they bring out to you.  Obviously, don&#39;t touch the bowl and exercise extreme caution when consuming by blowing profusely on each spoonful before eating.  I like to crack a nice cool egg in to my soondubu for extra flavor as well as to help cool down the soup a little faster.

I think they have a few other dishes but for the most part, everyone is here to eat their specialty.  Chodang does a pretty good job but I don&#39;t feel right giving them 4 stars only because I&#39;ve had better in other cities.  Even a chain restaurant like BCD Tofu is superior in comparison.

Well, I was wrong.  Chodang Tofu Village was great.  Service was simple,   walls a bit bare and stark, but the food was the star of the night.  We quickly ordered the soondubu with beef and soondubu with pork - regular.  The cooks quickly went to work and within a few minutes, our tofu soup came out boiling hot, rice steaming in the awesome stone bowl, and appetizers ready for us to nibble at.  In LA and SF, the rice didn&#39;t come in stone bowls so I wasn&#39;t sure what to do with the whole water thing. Supposedly, once you scoop your rice out, you should poor hot water in the bowl with your leftover rice.  This creates a porridge of sorts...sort of like congee.  I learned this by watching our neighbors eat.  The waitress didn&#39;t give us hot water so next time, I&#39;ll be sure to ask.  I have a feeling that since we weren&#39;t Korean, they assumed we didn&#39;t want to do this.  It&#39;s okay, my feelings weren&#39;t hurt.  Mostly, because the tofu soup was excellent and comforting. 

We ordered the soup regular which had the perfect amount of kick and smoothness.  The tofu was smooth and the beef was abundant.  They chop up the beef which wasn&#39;t a problem for me since tofu is the main ingredient.  The rice was perfectly sticky and clean.  I know that sounds funny but it wouldn&#39;t be if you&#39;ve eaten yellowish rice before - esp. at poor chinese/thai restaurants.  The small dishes fine - I&#39;m not big on them.  But they did have those little marinated beans that I used to love when I was little. 

I&#39;m so happy I found Chodang.  I can&#39;t wait to go back - maybe tonight!"

It&#39;s in a Mexican strip mall and next to what looks like a low budget women&#39;s Dr. office. 

It&#39;s nothing great to look at and you may be seated at a table in the corner where you can&#39;t pull your chair out because they store the vacuum cleaner behind you but, it&#39;s awesome. No frills, just good food. 

I love the tasty little dishes before your meal... my bf and I have to do a count down on their pickles to make sure none of us eats more than the other. 

The soups are delicious and easily vegetarian friendly. I love the side of rice and scooping it all out, then pouring water in to loosen up the burnt stuff. Read the back of their menu of you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. 1 meal there, once you add the water to your scooped out rice bowl (and throw in the extra from the tasty little dishes), is easily 2 or 3 days worth of food. 

I love getting my egg and cracking it in the soup to watch it cook... it&#39;s the poor man&#39;s (me) DIY Benihana. 

Give this little dive an open-minded try. It&#39;s truly delicious."

This is one of my favorite spots to eat in the vast universe of restaurants.  Whether it&#39;s cold outside, or if I feel a bit under the weather, or if I just need something hearty I make the drive out here.

The soup of course is great but it&#39;s hard to say more than what has already been said.

The rice porridge that you make at the end is amazing.  The taste of toasted rice fills my soul with warmth.

They give you 5 banchan (sides), but all 5 are very good.  Pickles, sprouts, beans, kimchi and spicy squid all hits the spot.  I usually end up asking for more pickles.

If you&#39;ve never had soondubu or never liked tofu, this place may a bit different for you, but for those that know what&#39;s up with tofu you&#39;ve got to come here."

We were NOT disappointed. I tried beef tofu the first night, and wasn&#39;t incredibly blown away, but I returned 2 days later anyway and found their marinated short-ribs to die for.

Terrific side-dishes. For those of you non-korean people, that means you get plenty of free food, albeit mainly vegetables. I don&#39;t know what those marinated beans are called, but they are sooooooooo delicious. I could easily eat 2-3 servings of that alone!

When you are looking for a HOT bowl of soup on a cold night, or any night for that matter Chodang Tofu Village is THE place to get your fix. My wife and I ordered the Dumpling Tofu Soup and Beef Tofu Soup to the table boiling and roiling in a stone bowl. If you feel like spicing it up there are 5 levels of heat ranging from white to very hot. On the night my wife and I went she went with the white and I got the regular for myself. 

In addition to the tofu soup you get a bowl of white rice and small side dishes ranging from kimchee, pickled cucumbers, and red beans. As we began to eat we started to take notice of how others were scooping out the rice and to get to the crispy rice that had been cooked to the sides of the stone bowl. The service is prompt and the soup as a meal is well worth it. Chodang Tofu Village is my go to place for HOT soup on any night. I&#39;m breaking a sweat just writing this review...."

The side dishes are nothing to write home about. 

An interesting thing about this place is that they give you rice in a stone pot. You add water into the pot at the end so that the rice on the sides of the bowl comes off and gives you a nice little rice treat =)

The food here was really good and this is one of the best soon du boo meals I&#39;ve had. 

I love the fact that it &#39;s boiling hot and you crack the egg in yourself when it comes out. And it seems like they cook the rice in little individual bowls so that there&#39;s a layer of rice stuck to the bowl so you can poor water into it and make nurinji or do what I do and wait for it to cool and scrape it off.

The little side dishes that came with it was good but not a lot of variety compared to other Korean restaurants but the soon du boo was perfectly done the soup was nice and flavorful and not too spicy and the tofu was soft. The only I didn&#39;t like was that the shrimp wasn&#39;t peeled but that&#39;s a minor thing to me.

If you happen to be in Chicago and find yourself in the burbs, this is one hotspot you don&#39;t want to pass up.

There are 2 locations, the original one in Mount Prospect and Naperville. Although they say it&#39;s family owned which I believe, I&#39;m not sure if the Naperville location shares the same recipe because it just doesn&#39;t taste the same there.

I ordered the combination BBQ ribs and the seafood soup.  One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the fact that it uses all stone or metal bowls for it&#39;s food.  This gives the rice that nice crispy texture.  The ribs were also very good.  And the soup was delicious.  It came out hot enough for the egg, and I ordered it hot, and I think it was pretty spot on (though for a Korean restaurant it was a bit milder than I expected).

The only downside to my experience was that it took three requests to get my drink.  Otherwise, service was spot on."

What is really nice is that even if you are eating all this comfort food, there is not much calorie counting in your head you are hoping to make up later. The soft tofu hotpot is one of best I had in Chicagoland. They get it on the right amount of seasoning between spicy, salty, and savory. The egg on top,  do not skip, it is the addition to bring the dish to another level. Thumbs up.

This is all for $9.99, and the sides are bottomless (bean sprouts, marinated beans, cucumbers, kimchee, and I think pickled radishes).  You also get a raw egg to drop into your own soup.  The only complaint I might have was that the amount of beef in the beef tofu and mixed seafood in the seafood tofu was quite skimpy.  It&#39;s still a good deal here though.  I found the regular spiciness level had a slight kick, and was just right for me, and not too bland as other reviewers warned.  Wife had her seafood tofu mild, and it was fine for her also.  The final self-serving of the burnt rice scrapings from the stonepot upon soaking with water was delectable, and it brought back childhood memories of this staple.  Next time, we&#39;ll try a tofu soup, but also get a short rib dish or something more meaty to accompany the soup dish.

We ordered #1 on the menu. (Seafood Tofu Soup, Spicy Level:  HOT)

At first &#34;bite&#34;,  I was immersed in silky smooth tofu heaven.  Bold flavor. The soup was very red, I was afraid I would be sweating bullets.  Surprisingly, the flavor was balanced and delicious!  (I&#39;ve been burned before=)

The bits of beef in the soup were my favorite.  Fresh clams.  The shrimp were so-so.  I enjoyed cooking my raw egg to my taste (slightly cooked, a little runny) 

Loved the piping hot steel bowl of rice broth that you cook with the meal.  (what kind of rice do they use?!  it taste premium and delicious!)

Honorable Mention:  PIckled Cucumbers (we kept ordering refills of this pan chan side dish)

Reasonable price:  Bill came out to $12/person.

Note:  Our group arrived when doors opened at 11am.  By 11:45am, the place was crowded. 

Casual, limited seating, simple decor.

Final Verdict: Exceptional Soondubu.  My new favorite place to eat this classic dish."

I crave soondubu in the winters so we made the 30 minute drive out here.

Our whole table went with the first choice on the menu #1. 
Thing is, Stacey P and I made the mistake of ordering Regular Spicy instead of hot. I usually can only handle a bit of spicy so &#34;Hot&#34; sounded like too much. Turns out Regular is way too bland - i mean there is barely any red color to the soup at the Regular level. I tasted one of my friend&#39;s who got the Hot level and it was really good! 

My recommendation is to go with Hot for everyone, or else it&#39;s not worth it. The tofu, beef, shrimp, and egg and other flavors and ingredients are really tasty. 

They also provide a rice broth that you made yourself while you&#39;re eating your soondubu - basically your rice comes served in a steaming hot bowl - you empty out your rice into the white bowl that they also give you. Then you pour some water into the silver steaming bowl and scrape off the rice that has baked into the edges and that cooks in the silver bowl while you&#39;re eating. At the end of the meal, this rice broth is tasty - like tea flavored rice. 

Really authentic place! Hope to give it 5 stars when i return and order the Hot version!

Do you know why?  Because I ordered regular spiciness.  Boo!

Based on other tofu soup restaurants I&#39;ve been to, which have all been in Atlanta, not Chicago, the price is a little high (price is $11, even though the menu says $10, and where I come from I pay 8 for similar or better quality), the kimchee selection is a little sparse (only 5 dishes, and they&#39;re relatively similar, or were tonight), and they never came around to put hot water in my rice bowl.

The soup comes in a piping hot stone bowl that they put right on the stove, a bowl of white rice in another piping hot stone bowl, and various goodies to eat with your meal.

The soup comes in a traditional korean stone bowl that is very hot but keeps the soup hot even bubbling as it comes out!   What a sight as I see my food get cooked before me.  It is straight up delicious and they give you an egg on the side to crack into your soup so it can slowly cook.  Crack it and leave it... you&#39;ll thank me later.  I didnt really enjoy the beef soup so instead I took on the beef sausage... not knowing what it was, the waitress said that it was just beef sausage... to my delightful surprise it was beef hotdogs!!!  Amazing!  (I&#39;m not be sarcastic).  
 
The rice comes in a stainless steel bowl that makes a delicious crust out of the rice that is directly touching the bowl.

First of all, it was extremely expensive compared to any other location due to being in the mall: $25 for one regular sandwich and 3 slims is outrageous.  But more importantly, they used stale, hard, discolored bread on all our sandwiches, the edges of the meat were discolored as though they had been left sitting out a long time, and the lettuce was brown in places and bitter. We couldn&#39;t finish the sandwiches.  If I had eaten at the mall rather than at home I would have taken it all back and demanded a refund."

However, on the rare occasion that I do crave a sandwich, JJ is my #1 choice.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s mainly because of the delicious soft bread that they use.  The rest of the ingredients are also fresh and tasty and I never ever got a bad sandwich.

My favorite is the #1 Pepe - Real applewood smoked ham and provolone cheese garnished with lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  The vegetarian one is actually pretty good, too!

This particular location is located near Sears and has seating for about 10 people.  There&#39;s also a bathroom in there, which I didn&#39;t use."

Everything was going great and the delivery driver shows up within about 15 mins or so.  I signed off on the receipt and went back to my desk. Once back at my desk I look through my order and find that I am missing a sandwich (no big deal). So I called the store and let them know I was missing one and they said they will send one to me shortly; little did I know that shortly meant a half hour.  It took a HALF HOUR for them to get back with my sandwich they forgot in the first place.  So while waiting (about 20 mins waiting already) I called the store back and asked for a manager.  The manager would not tell me his name and he was very rude as he came onto the phone and started to talk stating he knew for a fact the sandwich was in the bag when it left the store. I then kept interrupting him, since he would not allow me to speak at all, to tell him that it was not.  He then proceeded to call me a liar stating that someone I work with must have taken it before I came down to get it.  I told him that is impossible because my office has a lobby and the delivery driver was there the WHOLE time.  He then stated that &#34;before you even called I already started making a new sandwich for...&#34;  How did he know to make another sandwich BEFORE I called if the sandwich was in the bag the whole time according to him.  This whole experience was absolutely ridiculous and for a manager to not give me his name call me a liar is completely absurd.  I WILL not be giving any more of my business to this Jimmy John&#39;s store and it really gives a bad name to the whole company in general.  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE ALTOGETHER."

We just left this place and I will not go back. Do yourself a favor and go to Sushi Para on Dundee and Baldwin in Palatine.  We walked in and the hostess/waitress made it seem like we had to choose between all you can eat and a la carte before we sat down. I had to ask if it was ok if we decided to change our mind after we sat down. No water but received edamame and rice puffs for small appetizer.  We had to ask for water and then only received two glasses for 3 people. All three of us ordered all you can eat but the waitress never took our appetizer order so we received our sushi first then received our appetizers.  Sashimi is only included in all you can eat but as a requirement, for every three pieces sashimi, you have to order a roll? Awkward!  The sushi was mediocre at best. The sushi rolls were majority rice and the fish slices on the nigiri were very thin. 

 This restaurant is BYOB but the waitress never told us there was a charge per beer. One of the waitresses that hadn&#39;t helped us the whole time randomly asked us how beers we opened half way through our meal. And walked away.  When we asked for the bill, our original waitress asked us again how many beers we opened. She had the decency to ask us to check the box of the 12 pack we brought with us AND THEN told us they charge per beer we opened. 

As if the service and experience wasn&#39;t poor enough, one of the waitresses chased us out the door asking for the merchant copy of the receipts, which were left in the vinyl receipt booklet on the table. We told her they were left at the table and she ran back a second time asking for the merchant copies.  GO TO SUSHI PARA!"

Although I would&#39;ve liked to try the AYCE menu, it simply wasn&#39;t in the time for today. However, they have an AWESOME, I mean AWESOME deal for $9.80 and you get ANY two traditional rolls, miso soup and salad. It&#39;s honestly such a good deal since most traditional rolls are priced around $6.25 per roll.

Food: holy cow the sushi is awesome and amazing quality. I ordered the Philadelphia and Shrimp Tempura rolls, both awesome. The miso soup was still hot even though I got it to go, I was worried it would be cold, and the ginger dressing is amazing.

The all you can eat sushi is pretty lame.  The appetizer seaweed salad was barely a forkful. The edamame was cold and the miso soup tasteless.  Now for the rolls???  There was so much rice that you could not taste the fillings.  The small amount of sushi that was in the roll was by no means fresh.  There was no value in the all you can eat as the service was so poor by the time they returned to ask if we would like to order more, we had sat there thinking we should cut our losses.  Our server/manager/owner? asked how we found the food and when I replied (respectively) that we were a bit underwhelmed and found the rolls had too much rice and the edamame cold the response was &#34;oh&#34; and she walked away.  

Later that evening my guest and I both experienced stomach issues--wonder about our suspicions about fish freshness? 

With so many other great sushi restaurants nearby, I think I&#39;ll pass."

Yelp failed me with this restaurant. I went with my mom. For a birthday dinner and we did all you can eat sushi. Well, that&#39;s what I thought we did. In reality it was more like all you can eat rice. The sushi minimal amount of sushi they put in the roll was not fresh. It tasted fishy. The one time the waitress asked how the food was I told her honestly that the fish I was pulling,out was too tough to even chew. She responded &#34;oh yeah the yellowtail&#34; and just walked away. I am by no means new to sushi and this is not how it is supposed to taste. Since we already ordered all you can eat, we switched to the appetizers hoping they would be better. But they weren&#39;t that great either.

Later that night I had a bad tummy ache and some other symptoms you probably don&#39;t want to know about... So did my mom. It just didn&#39;t sit right. So do yourself and your stomach (and palate) a favor and stay away from this place. If you need AYCE go to Sushi Grove in Buffalo Grove. The same price with a better atmosphere and fresh fish.

  Our first visit we really enjoyed the service and the drinks. The rolls were hit and miss. Upon leaving we took a to-go menu with us to read more about their rolls and keep track of what he liked and what we&#39;d want to try.on our next visit.

 Our second visit was similar in the fact that the service and drinks were fantastic. Only the 6 rolls we ordered were ALL fantastic. We loved every last bite and it solidified that we have found our new sushi place!

The &#34;all-you-can-eat&#34; is my favorite. It includes all of the sushi and nigiri they have on the regular menu, as well as most appetizers and ice cream. Sashimi is not included, but they offer a deluxe sashimi platter with an ice sculpture and led lights for $21, and it&#39;s beautiful! This is a regular lunch and dinner spot for my friends and I. The service here is amazing, and you never have to decide if your glass is half empty or full, because it&#39;s always entirely full to begin with. 

I&#39;ve seen a lot of people complain about the $1 a piece for leftover on the &#34;all-you-can-eat,&#34; and I have to side with the restaurant on this one. The &#34;all-you-can-eat&#34; is just that.... ALL YOU CAN EAT. If you order more than you can actually eat, you get charged. It&#39;s that simple-- and it says so on the menu. You can&#39;t come in, order a lot, and take it home for later for free.... That&#39;s not how it works, and that&#39;s the policy for all sushi restaurant with an &#34;all-you-can-eat&#34; menu. I recommend ordering 1 or 2 rolls at a time, and no more. That way you can more properly pace yourself. 

The waitresses are very pleasant, and will take care of any problems or concerns you may have. People with dietary restriction and/allergies get special attention, and their food is made separate from everyone else&#39;s. If you have any, just tell your waitress, and she&#39;ll take care of you.

The quality of the food is AMAZING, no exaggeration! everything is made fresh to order, with many substitution options (i.e. brown rice, soy paper, etc.). If you ever sit at the sushi bar to watch them make the sushi, you&#39;ll see how sanitary and perfect everything looks! I was in awe.

I definitely recommend this place to everyone, especially sushi lovers! You won&#39;t find another place this perfect for the price!"

Its ingredient quality is similar to those of better sushi restaurants in the area (although the vegetables could be a little more crisp and fresher - but I&#39;m probably spoiled by going to Sushi Para) but the flavor combinations are better designed and uses less sauce than most other similar restaurants in the area.

The area in which this restaurant really shines is presentation. Both the plating and the design of the rolls is beautiful. The dining room is also spacious and comfortable with a city-like feel to it. The thoughtful design even extends into the washroom with modern materials used throughout to give it a chic feel. The service was also prompt and friendly.

The food comes in generous portions at good prices. When my group came here for lunch we got appetizers such as shrimp chips and edamame and then either salad with miso dressing or miso soup and seaweed salad to accompany the meal. It was very nice to get so many extras for a lunch that was inexpensive for Japanese. The frying here is very good so make sure you try dishes that contain items such as shrimp tempura, fried soft shell crab, fried squid, etc. 

Overall, this is another great sushi addition to the area and a great place to take friends where I know they&#39;ll enjoy the atmosphere and food as well."

I took my picky eater daughter here (she was 8 at the time) and even SHE found something on the menu that she loved.

My favorites were the Naruto and the Godzilla. The naruto roll is great to eat in the middle of your meal because it is wrapped in thin cucumber and contains no rice so it makes your food go down. The spicy tuna hand roll was also great, the seaweed was very soft and not chewy unlike most hand roll seaweed. The salmon and tuna sashimi which is also included in the AYCE was very fresh.

The sushi is decent for an all you can eat and we&#39;ve never really had a problem...until tonight.  I saw my sister pull something out of her mouth and to her dismay, it was a chard of plastic.  It was about half the size of a pinky nail with quite sharp edges.  She was very lucky she had not swallowed it.  

She brought this to the attention of the staff and the owner came over and looked like she really didn&#39;t have a clue as to how to deal with this.

However, when the bill came, nothing was taken off, no further mention of it was made.  I asked for clarification of the bill and the server indeed said that nothing had been done.  I didn&#39;t want to make a scene but I was infuriated at this point and said that if there is any foreign object in a meal, something must be done about it.  

The server went back to the owner and after about 10 minutes, she came back and said, &#34;we took 25% off of your sister&#39;s meal&#34;.  Sadly, there is already a 15% discount for everyone that walks in the door so the extra 10% off amounts to about $2.  My wife and I have come to this place over 10 times and spent over $500 at this establishment.  Our party alone tonight spent over $150 on this ill gotten meal.  I was so insulted I could hardly breathe.  So in saving herself $18 by not comping my sister&#39;s meal, she lost us as customers and any customers she&#39;ll lose through this review and by us telling this story over and over again.  

I used to be in the food service industry and it&#39;s a no brainer to comp a meal if there&#39;s something found in it.  What makes this worse is that she knows us and we&#39;ve brought in a ton of business as well.  This philosophy of the owner reflects how little she cares about the big picture and hints at a culture of cutting corners.  Penny wise and pound foolish.  What else is she skimping on?  How reluctant is she to throw out fish that&#39;s going bad?  It&#39;s obvious the bottom line is much more important than the safety of her customers.  

In conclusion, for your safety and peace of mind, I recommend not throwing away your hard earned money here.  If you look, the reviews here are quite wide ranging which is troublesome.  On the fence about trying this place out?  No brainer, stay away.  If you are a loyal customer, hope this opened your eyes to what can happen to you.  My sister was very lucky today but someone else may not be in the future."

With all of the headquarters of Japanese firm in Arlington Heights, the town has literally hundreds of good sushi establishments. This is a bit off the beaten path and not on the south side of town like most of them. It is tucked away in a nondescript strip mall. I probably would never have stopped has not a friend told me how good it is. 
I eat once a week here now. It specializes in an all you eat format. Generally that would turn me off, but this is an exception. The salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and white tuna are super succulent, sliced perfectly, and never frozen.  Be aware! Many sushi restaurants serve frozen fish, but not this one as far as I can tell. If you order any roll, you get three pieces if shashami. I recommend the Angry Dragon, or any of the tuna, eel, shrimp, or tuna based ones. They are never overpowered by sauces like you find elsewhere. Not only that,  they serve appetizers on the AYCE, too. We normally ordered crab rangoons, vegetable and shrimp tempura, and sometimes dumplings. Alcohol is available,  but you can also BYOB, not sure why; they charge 3.50 per wine set up. A dinner for 2 with 20% tip and BYOB will cost less than 50 dollars. This is the one restaurant I cannot due without. Great service and staff."

I&#39;ll never understand why my wife keeps making me go back here. The dining room was chilly. The service was so slow that the sushi was dry-aged and the hot appetizer cold. Did not seem to want to clear the table. The food contained almost no protein, more like rice rolls with sauce. Then the piece de resistance was the waiter spilling sushi over me. Perfunctory apology.  Did they offer any recompense? No.
Done...Never again. Even if it means we separate: she can go here; I&#39;ll go to Naomi&#39;s down the road."

I went in by myself on a Thursday evening for a quick dinner, and the place was empty, maybe two other tables were occupied. Service was mediocre at best for a place that was so empty. The food came out quickly, I will give them that though. 

They are an AYCE sushi &#34;buffet&#34; with a large menu and $21.95/person. The inside is very modern and trendy looking, and there is ample seating. Their sushi bar was small and had several seats in front of it. When I sat down, there was edamame at the table and I wasn&#39;t sure if it was for me, or if it was leftover from another party, so I didn&#39;t touch it. 

Service was not that great for a place that was so empty. I had to wait awhile for someone to come take my order sheet from me, however, the food itself came out quickly. 

I was INCREDIBLY disappointed with the food. Probably some of the worst sushi I have ever had, including sushi from Pei Wei and Jewel. I knew if I didn&#39;t eat it, I would still have to pay, and I would rather eat and pay, than waste food and money. The fish was all very fishy tasting, and lacked any palatable flavor besides fish. They put way too much sauce on all of the rolls that required sauce, and the rolls that were supposed to have tempura crunch on them didn&#39;t have any crunch at all. I ordered one roll that had something on top, I am pretty sure it was the Volcano roll, and I thought it was going to have all the ingredients wrapped on top of the roll nicely, but instead, it was everything almost pureed together into some sort of abomination of sauce and fish. Nothing tasted fresh and I had to scarf my food down in order to bring myself to finish. I was so upset because all of the Yelp reviews seemed great and the menu looked amazing online. Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t up to snuff. For less than what they charge, I could have gone to Sushi Para and eaten fresher tasting stuff that I would have been willing to wait for. I&#39;m glad I gave this place a chance, but I was very disappointed in the overall experience."

All you can eat is approximately $20 per person (which is a really good deal these days) and it&#39;s quality sushi.  This also includes many appetizer choices as well as ice cream at the end.

My husband and I are in DC now so it&#39;s really sad that I can&#39;t go to this place as often as I can, but now I can at least update my favorite sushi place&#39;s review.

I&#39;m pretty surprised that some of yelp reviewers here don&#39;t read the rules when it&#39;s clearly written on their menu.. 

I can assure you all that this restaurant is definitely worth much more than 1 star. And those people who had issues with servers and the restaurant owner, this would not happen if you communicated with them BEFORE it happened. 

1. For sushi buffet or any kind of buffet place, you CANNOT take your leftovers. It would be really silly if I went to Old Country Buffet, took 4 of 5 beef steaks and tried to take them for to go. Buffet noobs please read this.

2. I CLEARLY saw &#34;you will be charged for any leftover food from buffet orders.&#34; When I visited this place first time, my husband&#39;s best friend thought we wouldn&#39;t be charged for some chunks of rice but I asked the server because I wasn&#39;t 100% sure. Any leftover food, including chunks of rice that was taken off from sushi, will be charged (this doesn&#39;t apply for non-buffet orders)

I try to respect people who provide good service and food. There are things that this restaurant needs to fix though. The restaurant&#39;s chefs probably need to make sushi different (much better quality) if they make sushi for non-buffet customers (as they pay more money for less sushi). Also, they need to find out how to make sushi fast if the restaurant is crowded with buffet people. Since this restaurant&#39;s buffet-style sushi rolls are not pre-made and waiting for customers in advance, I would avoid having buffet lunch/dinner during peak time (11:30am-1:30pm and 6-8pm)"

I also love to eat, a lot.
No, seriously, a lot.
You can understand why all you can eat sushi would be so appealing to me, especially nested right in my backyard. 
Brand new, the staff (Angie specifically) were extremely attentive. I took my seat at the sushi bar, and reviewed the plethora of offerings on the all-you-can-eat menu.
The appetizers are very small, like mini tapas plates. I had the house salad, the seaweed salad and the edamame to start, and proceeded to order roll, after roll, after roll. 
Volcano, good. Summer, refreshing. Mango tango, yummy! Natoro, fresh and crisp. Pacific, incredible. Spider-Man, fantastic texture. Godzilla, epic.
I passed on the dessert- though, oddly enough, I could have eaten it.
Angie, my server, was very helpful in making recommendations, though she doubted the elasticity of my belly initially, she now knows. She kept me paced, and made me laugh and kept me nourished. The chefs were fast, but also personable, checking in between orders, and presenting beautiful and delicious rolls

It&#39;s the only sushi joint I know of in the area that is BYOB: $0.50/bottle which isn&#39;t too bad of a corking fee. They also have cocktails for $6.50 and a selection of beer. There is a buy one get half off deal on signature rolls from 11am-3pm. Service was very attentive. Mediocre sushi joint, come hungry to take advantage of the all you can eat!

Honestly, how many all-you-can-eat places will let someone take food home? FYI, all sushi places I&#39;ve ever been to, in this state or the next, with all-u can-eat have the same policy. 

I&#39;m not from the area. I tried and liked it bc a lot of the other sushi places around here close down their lunch around 2:30 and my sushi craving hit around 2pm. The house sake was good. The rolls were spot on. I completed plenty of work emails in the time I was there.

It&#39;s a tough restaurant market. Everywhere you look a restaurant hangs on the corner. They hold their own despite this. Maybe it&#39;s not the busiest, but the atmosphere, manager, and waitress were tentative, timely and food taste was quality over quantity.

The sushi was pretty good but that&#39;s not why I gave this place such low rating. The customer service was horrible and by horrible I mean horrendous.

(In case you don&#39;t want to read my long rant I will be more then happy to summarize it.  We came. We ate. Manager/owner (not sure) was so rude. Wanted to charge 1$/left over piece. We wanted to take the left overs to not waste food. Pay bill (after 30 min altercation) waitress comes over grabs our take out boxes of good sushi and throws it out in front of us). They had no remorse. Poor hungry people in the world. 

My friend and I had left overs after the all you can eat and it was clearly the end of the world for our waitress and manager. Since this wasn&#39;t our first rodeo we were aware that we would have to pay for some kind of fee. I was so full but I really wanted the left overs because I would be hungry again in an hour or two and I would of loved to eat them and bring some home for my roommate. 

1. After making it seem like the end of the world the waitress said I have to talk to the manager about ur left overs, we were a little confused but said okay. 
2. She disappeared into the back with our sushi for a solid 10-15 min (this was alarming. Why was our food missing for so long?)
3. She came back with everything packaged- this was annoying. My friend and I were going to two different places why was there one box when we had not even asked for it to be boxes at this point. 
4.  Waitress proceeded to drop the box on our table and said &#34;ok, additional 20$&#34;. You should of seen our faces. 
5. We said no and asked for the manager
6. Manager came over and flipped out, yelling at as asking why we don&#39;t want to pay the bill. We calmly explained we are more then happy to pay the bill bc we eat and we are not skipping out on the bill. The issue was  Us being charged $1/left over piece which we felt was a lot. We explained that other places charged a flat fee vs a monetary amount per piece. 
7. The manager then looked at us saying I&#39;ve seen you here before you know the rules. For starters this was a &#34;grand opening&#34; and I shleped from the city and my friend and I had NOT ever been there. This was our first time and we were super excited to try it 

Fast forward 20 min 
She said she will wave the fee but next time we know the rules. We politely said there would not be a next time because she had been so rude, and needs to reassess the meaning of customer service. 

Semi long story short they brought us the bill we paid for our all you can eat sushi dinner. And then the waitress came over picked up our left over boxes and threw them out right in front of us. 

I WAS LIVID. They made such a big deal of us wasting food (which we weren&#39;t we really wanted the left overs) and then in the end they threw out 2 1/2 worth of rolls. This really upset me. I didn&#39;t want to waste the food and was willing to pay a flat fee for the left overs. There are hungry people out there and just to prove a point they threw everything out."

My friend and and I can eat A LOT of sushi, so we went with the all you can eat menu. 

We began with soup and salad (both were excellent, not unlike what we&#39;ve had in high-end teppanyaki restaurants), and then we moved on to several rolls. Each roll arrived beautifully prepared, and they were huge! We loved the spider roll, the Pacific, and the Mango Tango! I also love eel, so I ordered unagi maki. That, too, didn&#39;t disappoint. 

I should mention that my daughter who doesn&#39;t eat sushi was also well cared for. She had a banana smoothie that she claimed &#34;tastes like heaven&#34; and an order of gyoza. The gyoza were a bit average and not a ton of flavor, but no one cared because we were stuffed on everything else!

That is NOT a reason for people to be bashing this place! You chose to overestimate your appetite, not the chef who expertly made your noms. Okay rant done. I&#39;ve read a lot of negative reviews about this so I avoided it for a few sushi date nights until finally I&#39;m was like lets try this place! First impression is that its big and the decor confuses me a bit. The little chandelier lite and the mural kinnda went two different ways for me. BUT I dont care what the place looks like as long as its clean! We were promptly approached by a waitress (I think she may be the owners wife, she seemed more invested than just a waitress) who asked if we wanted the AYCE. HECK yes I do! We sat by the sushi making station and watched them prepping and rolling. I was a little disappointed it was so empty in there, I feel like they&#39;ve gotten a bad rap. The menu was pretty extensive, from maki to sushi. I asked if they&#39;d let me order with no tobiko because I dont like roe, and didnt want them to waste it on me scraping it off. Waitress said no prob, just scratch it out. I like that because some places get offended if you make changes. They give you a little dish of edamame and they serve pepsi products. The BF for some different maki, and the 5th ave special roll #2. I decided to give the apps a try (they&#39;re included, two pieces an order). I got two orders of crab rangoon, served very HOT and fresh with a nice crunch and good flling, and an order of gyoza. I prefer my gyoza a little crispier, but the filling was good. For my rolls I got the shrimp crunch which is covered in little colorful puffed rice, and after trying the bfs 5th ave special 2, I ended up ordering it too. The waitress made it very clear that the specialty rolls come in 8 pieces and to order in stages. I&#39;ve done a lot of AYCE so I know my pace and didnt feel rushed at all. 

On the topic of the waitress, she was not hovering but def prompt if I looked at her. She was on top of refills and bringing more menus for me. She was super nice and I dont know who people were referring to in other reviews about being rude.\

The speed of the sushi making was pretty on point for all other places I&#39;ve eaten at. The shrimp tempura was freshly made, and tasted like they battered to order. Other reviews didnt mention buy you ALSO get a little ice cream cup with AYCE. I think apps, dinner, and a little dessert is a GREAT deal for 21 bucks. Plus they&#39;ve got a 15% off AYCE running right now. I say give them a shot, everyone that came in seemed happy and like they were enjoying the food. I feel like if they were in a busier plaza by woodfield they&#39;d do better...that burlington coat factor plaze area is kind of dead...

All in all, great dinner and we will def be back. I&#39;d say its better than Asian Toyko on Algonquin when it comes to service, sushi/apps are about on point. The little vanilla ice cream won me too over :)"

My two favorite rolls are the mountain and angel hair.  The all you can eat in unbeatable value and it&#39;s not buffet style it&#39;s made when you order.

I&#39;d normally say this is closer to 4 stars, but I&#39;m shaky on their service now. We ordered take out on Valentines day and it took close to two hours to get the food. Granted it was a busy day, but no order should take 2 hours (and especially since they said it would only take 45 minutes). It was evident they just forgot about many of the take out orders because there was a herd of take out people waiting forever."

Went to 5th Ave to try a new sushi restaurant. My family eats sushi 2-3 times a month. So we are very familiar with the quality of sushi as well as AYCE sushi. Based on the reviews we thought we would give this place a try. Big big mistake. The quality of fish was so poor. Old, tasteless and dry. After eating only 4 pieces I was very disappointed and wanted to stop. I had to force myself to take another bite.  The rice was tasteless and lacked flavor. Texture was mushy and pasty. The fish was minimal in the rolls and lacked any flavor.  You could definitely tell it was not fresh. How can you screw up a regular tuna role or salmon sushi piece. Waitstaff was ok. Towards the end, the manager came around and asked how the food was. I told her the truth - tasted lousy and was so bad that I couldn&#39;t stomach another bite. She asked what was wrong and I said rice is tasteless and fish was dry and old tasting. She asked how much did I order. And I was like. It is not that I am full as I eat at Sushi Regularly and know how much I can eat.  She responded by saying oh. We have lots of customers and walked away. Wow. She asked the question didn&#39;t like the answer and walked away. Please stay away from this place. I should have read more of the one star reviews but they are right on. It is absolutely terrible. If you want a better AYCE sushi place. Definitely take your money to Sushi Para in Palatine. Only 10 min away and worth the wait. Or go to Sakura in rolling meadows for a non AYCE place."

I rounded up to four since it&#39;s the first review. We began with edamame, miso soup, house salad, and crab Rangoon. The edamame was standard, the miso soup was good, the salad had a delightful ginger house dressing (though there may have been too much dressing) and the crab Rangoon was very cream cheesy but tasted great with their house sweet and sour sauce. 
For our sushi, we got the spicy tuna, crunch salmon, rainbow roll, the mango tango, ocean view, and pacific. Our favorite was the ocean view. This one stood out among the others. The others were just okay. No complaints at all except for the amount of mayonnaise used in the crunch (too much) and the spicy tuna wasn&#39;t spicy enough."

Read the rules if you are planning on coming for &#34;all you can eat&#34; deal starting at 3pm. 
This place is quite awesome. Amazingly fresh fish and a great deal BUT they have pretty strict rules in place to make it possible for you to eat as much as you want for $21!! Duh! You need to make sure you know what to expect to have a great experience here and save your complaints later. The staff is very helpful and friendly and will answer any of your questions before you order. Ask for explanation of the sizes of each roll, etc. Order little first then order more later if still hungry. Don&#39;t over order right away and have left overs you will have to pay for. Your plate has to be completely CLEAN of food when you request your check. Not even rice left. Nothing. There is also a small charge when you BYOB.

A lot of different appetizers to choose from and all of their rolls on the all you can eat are signature rolls. My favorite I would say is the flaming dragon. This roll is baked with shrimp tempura topped with salmon, super white time, black and red Tobiko and scallion. Also with house special sauce and spicy mayo. I love that all their rolls taste different. Haha as odd as that sounds , it&#39;s true. I love sushi para too but all of it just tastes the same and after a whole it gets old.

We asked to simply pay for the rolls individually and please honor the sign they had in the foyer when you walk in that read &#34;Buy 1 signature roll, get 2nd 1/2 off!&#34; We did not want the all you can eat price of $21.95 pp. No, they wouldn&#39;t honor it. We were charged at $21.95 and still left hungry, scared to order anymore food and wait another hour. Service was sooooo poor that our blonde waitress never refilled our drinks nor comped an appetizer or anything after waiting 90 minutes for food to come.

Left $20 on the table even tho it wasnt worth $5 tip just to get out of there as quick as possible!

We had a delicious chicken curry dish and a vegetable biryani in addition to some garlic naan and a cheese dessert.  I also had a very tasty but filling yogurt mango lassi to start.  The new owners added a small vestibule in the front of the restaurant which makes the inside a little warmer.  They also added tablecloths and nice dishes to each table.  Our server was very helpful and friendly.  I would definitely like to go back as we loved the taste of everything although we found that medium spicy was a bit too much for our palates.  

They will soon be adding a lunch buffet for $8.99 which is a great thing for those of us who are new to Indian cooking.

One thing to note is that the owners pass along the 3.99% that they pay for credit card transactions directly to the customer.  It is clearly listed on the bottom of the bill.  You will save money here if you pay in cash."

The fries were just disgusting,  probably prepared from frozen package.  I called the restaurant to tell them and give our feedback, but they thought we were calling to get something for free.

The delivery guys patiently waited (by the way, I&#39;m still really sorry!) and I&#39;m very grateful. The food is good and the lunch portions are a good size.

The chicken shwarma was a big hit and the most popular order from the group. I got the vegetarian plate both times and loved it. It had grilled zucchini, onions, tomatoes, and even some fried potatoes and is served with a falafel patty, rice, and a small salad. Delicious! The rice served with everything is really good as well.

If you&#39;re a vegetarian, there are apparently no entrees; you&#39;re ordering from the Vegetarian / Appetizers section.  I got the stuffed grape leaves; hummus; and samosa (haven&#39;t seen those in a Middle Eastern restaurant before) and a glass of mango juice.  Service was pretty quick but I arrived an hour late after 20 other people ordered.  The food is fine, but not something I&#39;d travel for.  The samosa were thin-skinned like egg roll wrappers; they are available vegetarian or with meat, baked or fried (I think mine were baked).  They came with a tasty yogurt-based dip I haven&#39;t had elsewhere that was really quite nice.  The pita bread was fine, as was the hummus; the grape leaves were served in a thin tomato coulis with what appeared to be frozen &#34;garden vegetables&#34; (corn, cubes of carrot, cut green beans).  They were fine but not worthy of note.  Available desserts were baklava or herissa (semolina cake), neither of which I&#39;m crazy about so I left it at that.

The trouble started when the server started handing out the bills; apparently a 20% &#34;pay cash&#34; discount hadn&#39;t been communicated to the staff, and I&#39;m pretty sure although I was told it was applied to my order, that it wasn&#39;t.  Also please don&#39;t bring me $3 change when I pay a $16.07 ticket with a twenty.  We got it all sorted but it wasn&#39;t a fantastic finish to dinner."

more on my predicament here. 

See the chicken kabob was good quality - the texture and color were so nice, and was served in a very tasty good sized portion. 

The bed of rice and vegetables were fine, perhaps the zucchini and squash were a bit....soggy. but no matter. 

To the best of my ability I think it was the hummus...such a suspect hummus. it was too creamy and flavorless; really so unlike hummus it was remarkable. 

alright the point - I shit violently within hours of eating. 

Mina, what have you done?!

For starters, we had hummus, which was the best I&#39;ve ever had and seemed to be home made. It was a fine grind, with oil, with a delicate flavor and a sprinkle of a little giardiniera mix on top which added to the interest. The small $3 order would suffice for 2 people. Hot pita comes with the appetizers and meals.

We had Mina Mixed Grill (grilled large shrimp, chunks of beef &amp; chicken, on a bed of delicately flavored rice), and Moroccan Lamb Shank Tagine (a tender shank on the bone and also with the delicious rice). Everything was great. Try the hot tea too.

It&#39;s a large clean restaurant with a colorful ethnic motif and linens on the tables. Service was very friendly, attentive and prompt. They do have ethnic entertainment some evenings. The lunch and dinner menus are very large and prices represent good value. There are lots of specials too, and large family-sized combos.

Our waitress was kind of aloof, but there was also a waiter and a (I&#39;m guessing) manager who helped bring out the food, and they were outstanding! Super friendly, hilarious, actually anticipating our needs. (Towards the end of our meal, my partner was looking at a menu from another table to make sure he could remember the name of the dish he ordered -- the waiter guessed this correctly and quickly brought over a paper menu, pointing at a picture of the lamb dish on the front :).) We also had a living social deal that was accepted without any problems.

I ordered the lentil soup, which came with a delicious topping of baked pita chips, and small Veggie Mina Mezza platter. It was all very good, though everything seemed a bit lacking in the savory department. A little salt perked it right up. My partner&#39;s lamb was of a very good portion for the price, and came with an amazing tomato saffron sauce that I couldn&#39;t stop stealing spoonfuls of.  The one thing I wish they wouldn&#39;t do is use the veggie mix that is clearly from frozen bags. Also, the Italian murals on the walls were hilariously distracting. Besides that though, the ambiance was nice. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try the Egyptian Eggplant."

You can&#39;t go wrong with hummus and pita as an appetizer. Hummus is creamy and the seasoning and oil is just right. Falafel is crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside. My go-to at Mediterranean places is usually a kifta kabob entree and it didn&#39;t disappoint here. You get 4 tasty pieces around a bed of rice covered in roasted vegetables. There is an entree sampler where you can get each of the meat items they offer. Entrees cost about $12 each. One day I will try it and be in heaven. The inside decorations and ambiance is pleasant.

I received the lower leg portion of lamb w the smallest portion of meat, about 4 bites, but well presented w veg and tasty rice.

All in all we enjoyed our talk and our meal which everyone loved the spices and flavors and reminded us of homemade. The prices are reasonable but some portions are small compared to others you might have had such as the leg of lamb I mentioned.

As soon as you walk in, the atmosphere looks awesome in my book, the painting on the walls were beautiful. The staff was helpful as well. Right away we were given a menu and my Lady and I wanted to keep things on a budget so we ordered one the meals where you basically pick 5 selections.

My Lady got her self a glass of wine, which was good she stated.

When picking our appetizer, I will note it is wise if the staff has knowledge on the different food items. I asked about one particular appetizer, and there was no knowledge as to what was in it, so instead we had Baba ghanoush, which tasted excellent.

Second type of course, my Lady had the soup and I had the Arabic Salad, both tasted excellent as we shared with one another.

For our meals, She had  the Kifta Kabob and I had the Chicken Shawerma the food was excellent, we loved it all.

For dessert they should have asked us what we wanted instead of just bringing us both baklava, as I have a real bad allergy to tree nuts. They brought a real small portion, which to be honest should of been bigger portion. After realizing I had an allergy they got me strawberry ice cream.


Over all the food was great, the service was great as well, even little minor issues, but I am not one to make a big deal out of nothing.


Note for the owner, and waiting staff, I would make sure your patrons do not have allergies to foods, as well I would make sure the server knows all the dishes, so when asked a question they know how to answer the patron. Also have cell phones on hand on silent, it is very unprofessional to have a cell phone ringing in the main room where patrons are eating.  

Over all not putting the restaurant down, just any place would need to know this, over all the food was excellent."

The woman on the phone said the food was halal except the deserts ie the cakes.  I said salam to the person who brought me the food didnt return my walaykum so something was up. So eat halal .

I called the restaurant and explained to the woman what has happend and said, &#34; I would like to order on line but your website keeps crashing can I order with you and still get the 10% off( its 10% wont break the bank) she said no just keep trying thats all I can say. I said wait a minute your telling me that you cant give me the 10 % off when its your website thats the problem??? She said no just keep trying. I was so blown away with the lack of guest service(being from a 25 year restaurant history) i culd not believe what I was hearing. So needless to say we didnt order from them. I guess they careless about their community and
their guest. I see this from restaurants and sorry to say I see these types of restaurants going out of business really quick. I would not suggest this place to anyone just becasue I know you will have a bad guest experience. I dont know how the food is didnt even get that far. People who dont care about the people that keep them going dont go any where."

I tried to use it during the week, Mon-thurs but each time I called I was told no.  It was Sunday, I went in solo and asked if I could take out, due to the hour 8:30 pm.  Their website said open until 10 but was told kitchen is closing, but no, I couldn&#39;t carry out and if I wasn&#39;t happy, I could get my money back!  So I said, fine, I will eat in.  I was rushed to order, served by a waitress holding a cellphone to her ear, not once but 3 times she came to the table, was talking on her cell phone.

I asked about an ingredient, and she said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.  Period.  I asked for a to go box and got a box for a tiny portion.  I asked for some of the white sauce with my leftovers, I was told, we are out of it and she brought me the hot red sauce .  I asked if she was the owner, she said no.  At one point she went out the door behind my table and a huge gust of wind and curtains were blowing.  She did this twice.  There was a man ( mgr ?) talking LOUDLY on his cellphone across the empty room throughout my meal, in the dining room and I heard LOUD voices coming from the kitchen.

At 9 pm, the lights were dimmed!!  There was one other table in the entire restaurant, we all left about the same time.
So unwelcoming, so uncaring about any dining satisfaction, and such rude habits to observe and experience.  I live less than 2 miles away and was there once years ago and I am SHOCKED they remain open.  What is unfortunate, the food was decent even tho the woman had no idea what the seasoning flavor was on my dinner - I ordered a combination plate and a side of Baba Ghanouj.
They should be ashamed ... No diner should be treated with such blatant indifference.
You would think after so many poor reviews about POOR service, they would learn ... Update your Sunday hours on the web but don&#39;t tell me you are closing your kitchen at 8:30 to prevent me from dining... 
I worked in an upscale steakhouse for 5 years and we NEVER made a late diner feel rushed or unwelcome ... That you get 5 stars for."

The decor is classy and clean... a little bit more  upscale than other middle east places at which I have eaten.

The service is prompt.  I am always a little surprised at how dead this place is for lunch, but maybe that is why the server always has time for me.

The lunch specials are very reasonably priced.  I like the $7 kefta kabob.  With the warm pitas and some rice"

My husband and I both ordered non - alcoholic bevs and she kept trying to push us to order wine, also my son is little so he only drinks water and she seemed very unhappy with that too.

He actually asked us twice if he could sit with us and then asked if he could just stand there and chat with us.  We tried to be nice at the beginning and said we were having girl time, but he did not get the hint.  He came back every 2 minutes and would just stand there and kept interrupting  our conversation.  He asked us where we worked, how old we were, if we were married, etc.  It was the most unprofessional experience I&#39;ve had at a restaurant.

Let me start by saying that I am Middle Eastern...meaning I know good/bad Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food. I&#39;m not an expert but I know how things are supposed to taste. 

My husband and I were excited to try a new Mediterranean restaurant around the area. We purchased a groupon yesterday and were able to use it today. 

As soon as we walked in, the lady had no idea how to greet us. She pointed to a table and walked away. We seated ourselves at the table we assumed was for us. Not sure who our server was but I&#39;m convinced the two other people working there were her children. One was the waiter/server the other was the person who brings out the food. 
We had to ask for a glass of coke three times. Our glasses of water sat empty for quite some time. OH and we had to ask for menus as we sat in silence for 15 minutes. During our silent period we overheard THREE tables ask where their food was. 

We had the Mina Mezza appetizer...which was ok but bland and not done right. The tabbouleh had no lemon or oil in it (which it&#39;s supposed to), the lebnah had dill in it (not supposed to), falafel is supposed to come with sauce (that was apparently missing), and who puts tomatoes on baba ganough?

My husband and I both had the Mina Platter (combination platter in any other restaurant). Rice was pretty good but topped with tomatoes (yet again). Our food came with this greenish white sauce which was spicier than all hell. I&#39;m not sure what that&#39;s supposed to be but I can promise you...it is NOT Middle Eastern maybe Far East because it tasted like wasabi and yogurt.

This is the best part (please try to not throw up), my husband takes one bite out of his food and turns to me and gives me a weird look. He pulls out a LONG piece of hair from his mouth. How nice! Disgusting. We immediately called the hostess over. I whispered to her our grotesque finding when she snatched the hair out of his hand and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; and walked away. I called her back over and asked for  a fresh plate when she responded &#34;oh, we don&#39;t do that here&#34;. Are you serious? Then she asked my husband &#34;well, where is the hair?&#34; He looked at me as if he was confused. I too did not understand this question. I said to her &#34;you just took it and threw it on the floor&#34;. She said &#34;how do you know it was in your food&#34;? I can tell you for a fact that my husband&#39;s hair is pretty darn short and mine is medium brown and straight not black and wavy. 
So basically she accused us of putting hair in our food. She refused to replace the dish and started to argue with us. We asked for the check. She walked away and actually came back with a check and asked &#34;Do you want any of this to go&#34;? She has got to be out of her mind if she thinks we were going to take any of that crap home. I wouldn&#39;t feed it to my dog or ANY dog. 

Service is a ZERO. 
Overpriced Food is a big fat ZERO.
Recommend this dump to my worst enemy: NO! 

If I could give this place zero stars I would! 

OH and just for kicks I am going to put this out there. My husband went to the restroom when he came back laughing. 
Whoever designed this bathroom and installed the urinals must have been really tall. My husband is 6&#39;2&#34; and he had to stand on his tippy toes at the urinal (according to him). 
Ha ha ha! What an experience and a waste of our time and money. 

If you are thinking about going here; don&#39;t bother. Go to Pita Inn (they make the food the right way and its half the price plus bigger portions)."

Okay, yes, the wait staff needs to spend some money on personality classes... but as far as the food, I say its great. I came for the food anyway, not to make friends. 

We&#39;ve been there a few times now and the quality of service varies. 
If you&#39;re on lunch, let them know or you may end up asking for a box to go soon as you get your food (This happened to me once) but the food is always FRESH, good quality meat that isn&#39;t too fatty. 

For the price, I don&#39;t think you can beat it. Way better than Falafel Bistro down the street for about the same price.

It took a little while for the server in the nearly empty restaurant to help us. She welcomed us with a nice smile then seated us in a corner next to stacks of chairs and remote control toy cars. Really?? My first thoughts were something out of an episode of Ramsey&#34;s Kitchen Nightmares. 
We then waited for our menus which she brought us and never offered us a wine menu (which she offered other guests). We ordered our food, and then as we waited, the nice chef came by and said hello and brought us what he described as Arab salad,a bowl of diced cucumbers and tomatos with parsley in a light vinegrette, which was very nice. We ordered Falafel which were nice and crunchy on the outside, Bland tasting and gooey on the inside. Also they gave us a sauce with the falafel which we didnt know what the heck it was..a yogurt dill concoction that was awful!! Also the sauce with our entress was unrecognizable, I think it was a cross between wasabi and tatziki without tahini. Who knows what that was... it also looked weird. The shwarma was ok with the exception they never offered pita with it,and the grilled veg mess wasn&#39;t flavorful at all... The food was ok tasting, not the best overall. They should take lessons from some of the great medeteranian restaurants in the city. Overall, not horrible, but nothing to write home about. This place needs to step up their game,"

The food was 5 stars.  I am not a connoisseur of Mediterranean food, but everything I tried was wonderful.  The baklava for dessert was possibly the best I have had.

Unfortunately, the staff couldn&#39;t seem to get out of their own way.  The service was 2 star.  They could really benefit from some professional service training.  When ordering a bottle of wine, you should open it table side and offer a taste before pouring the full glasses... not bring the already opened bottle, which then turns out to be not the one that was ordered!  We never got our water glasses re-filled.  After we were finished eating, no one seemed particularly interested in bringing our check, even after clearing our dishes.

Fortunately, we were not in a hurry and we had read similar reviews, so we were prepared for the worst... and it wasn&#39;t the worst, but it wasn&#39;t good either.  I wouldn&#39;t go here if you are impatient or in a hurry.  But if you can be laid back and are willing to offer some grace for the service, I would recommend it.

Oh... and we also had a gift certificate from restaurant.com, but the owner said they were not accepting them any longer, due to problems with the company.  Fair warning."

The atmosphere and service is great, but more importantly the food is delicious and filling for a very reasonable price.  The employees are very friendly. Their food is honestly one of a kind. This is the one place I have found to have the real shawirma the way it&#39;s made in Egypt. I&#39;ve been to several middle eastern restaurants, but 2 thumbs up to Mina Restaurant.

The decor is nice and atmosphere is relaxing. I thought it was nice listening to arabic music while ate. it made me feel like I was in the middle east. 

Must go and Enjoy the good food &amp; good mood!"

Why? This place has the decor that will charm those shiny, sparkling shoes right off her.  The food?  You and your party will experience a delight.  Listen, Middle Eastern folks on Yelp that are giving them poor reviews, listen to me now.  Your mum&#39;s cooking has made you biased.  These cooks at Mina have been cooking in Egypt for a while, using methods taught to them by the pharaohs, probably. 

Pricing? Dude.. understand where this food is coming from.  It&#39;s not your Pita Inn, frozen chow.  This stuff is fresh to the max.  Keeping it real, these folks, you&#39;ll pay no more than $8 for lunch.  You&#39;re also helping out a local joint, not the devil.  

I was chilling in Egypt earlier this year, craving some quality kifta.  This joint satisfy.  

Hellz to the yes, they also lowered their entree prices recently.  Try the meat plate.  Nearly had a protein baby after that sucka.   Word."

It wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t anything to &#34;Yelp&#34; about either. Especially the lentil soup, which was extremely bland. Hence why this review comes three weeks after I visited this place. The biggest downside is the price for lunch and your not really getting what you pay for. I recommend heading over to Shish Kabob in Rosemont.  Better quality and better prices. 

Other notes: 
Have they changed the decor yet? Last Time I went they still had some stuff from the previous restaurant , Vita Mia.

I had the reverse of Mark H.&#39;s experience. Our waitress was fantastic and on top things throughout the meal

Sadly first experiences count a lot and I don&#39;t see my coworkers or myself coming here anytime soon."

It does serve alchohol but they did repeatedly say that they use zabiha halal meat. My wife ordered the beef and chicken kabobs and really liked them. My daughter loved the beef kifta kabob. I had the combo of chicken and beef kifta. The falafels were ridiculously good. They give very generous portions, great prices and service was good. Their dessert portions are really good too.I could have been spoiled by Lebanese, Afghani and Persian kabobs. . I will have to make one more trip to see if I can upgrade my rating"

Otherwise, the service was terrible. Apparently, there ONE waiter didn&#39;t come in today so the lady was on her own. It took 10 minutes to get our water and another minute to get our menu. The lady didn&#39;t know much about the menu and didn&#39;t bother writing down our 3 orders. about 45 minutes later we got our order, which to no surprise, was the wrong one. We only had an hour lunch so I decided not to complain and just eat the food. It wasn&#39;t worth the 45 min wait let me tell you that. I wanted rice and got fries instead. I also ordered chicken shawerma and instead got what seemed like a chicken wrap?? I was craving Mediterranean food so bad and it did not satisfy my craving. In fact, it was a pretty big disappointment. 

I also over heard another customer complaining about not getting her soup that she ordered. Other people in the restaurant didn&#39;t order for about 20min or so. 

They definitely need to work on there service if they want people to come back."

Customer service is definitely an issue here. There was only one waitress on staff (understandable considering we were the only customers), however, the service was slow and extremely apathetic. The waitress was not necessarily rude, but definitely not friendly at all. It felt like during our entire meal, she just wanted our table of three to order and get the hell out. 

During our meal, the waitress decided to pick up her cell phone and chat away in the dining room. We first saw a glance of a smile from her as she sat at the bar watching tv while we waited for any type of service. Just a recommendation Mina&#39;s; please pick and choose which audio source you would like to expose to your customers. A blaring tv drama that is at the same loud level as your music is not a pleasant experience.

We ordered some hummus, falafel, chicken/beef schwarma, and a chicken/beef kabob platter. The food was decent, but nothing to rave about. The only reason this got a 2 stars instead of a 1. 

If you enjoy the following, you should definitely visit Mina&#39;s

1. Slow service that will ruin the greatest of moods
2. I am in no way a water snob, but the tap water here tasted extremely metallic forcing the entire table to purchase beverages
3. Dinner + Music + a TV Drama
4. Average tasting food"

Its a lovely little restaurant, comfortable and welcoming with a small bar/lounge area.  Unfortunately it was evident from the moment we stepped in the door that the owner was new to the restaurant business.....the service was oh so lacking.  The owner and the waitstaff were so very kind but the staff really seemed pretty clueless what was expected of them.

We ordered the Mina mezza small appetizer with hummus, kubbah, falafel, baba ghanoush, grape leaves and lebna.  However apparently they were out of grape leaves as there weren&#39;t any served to us.  The hummus and falafel were pretty tasty to me however my husband who hails from the Middle East wasn&#39;t impressed the hummus.  For our main entree we split the Mina platter: beef and chicken kabob, kufta kabob, and beef shawarma along with rice and grilled veggies.  But.........they were out of rice.  NO RICE!  What Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean/Egyptian restaurant doesn&#39;t have rice???  Instead of rice they gave us a side of the bechamel pasta and a couple of baby lambchops.  Overall the food was pretty tasty--I loved the kufta kabob as it was seasoned just right, not too much.  My husband was also pretty satisfied with the meal.

But the service was so horrible!  No one knew when to bring the food or drink, when to refill our water, when to bring the check, when to clear our plates.  The owner assured us they he had just hired two experienced servers and the service would not be a problem in the future.  But first impressions are very important when it comes to restaurants......

The owner and his wife are wonderful, friendly individuals and I really want them to succeed at this restaurant but my first impression was so, so bad.  The food was great but only time will tell if it was good enough to lure me back despite my memories of such lacking service from this visit!"

The difference wasn&#39;t much more than her tip would have been, but the whole experience just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

Service and food was TERRIBLE. Since the moment we got there, waitress lady (named Mariam) treated us like garbage. For example(s): I asked for a salad with meat on it and she laughed; we bought a Groupon for the restaurant, and she said they aren&#39;t accepting it; they charged us 18% gratuity-When we asked about the 18%, she said its because its a holiday (July 4). Additionally, the food was low quality. I am from Egypt so I know my Arab food and eat out a lot. Go to Pita Pita on Dundee Rd and route 53 for great Arab food and service. The 1 star is for the male manager who finally accepted our Groupon and for the chicken kabobs that were decent."

Grilled pita with my Baba ghanouj- some of the best I have had in awhile! Grilled veggies with my combo. Delicious. Decor is very nice as well.

We got coupons for the place in the mail, so thought we should check it out since it&#39;s very close to us and we don&#39;t have Mediterranean food like ever. 

We got there very early. We&#39;re Polish and our dinner is eaten early compared to American people, and then we eat Supper when Americans eat dinner. It was about 3-4pm. The restaurant was empty. We waited a little bit and then the owner (I&#39;m guessing?) sat us down. I had to grab the menus myself, he forgot to bring them over. He was very friendly and he had an accent. He was Egyptian. The place itself is very nice and with a lot of flavor. It has a nice atmosphere and very nice decor. Props for that. 
We ordered our food. I had the Kefta Kebob, which is beef and lamb with some rice and grilled veggies. The food was very good. It was nicely prepared and had a large pita chip thing in the middle of it, as with every other dish we ordered. It was pretty cool. My mom had the Lamb Chops which were really good too and it was my first time trying lamb so that was something else.. but I enjoyed it however I thought it was a little fatty. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just how lamb tastes or if that&#39;s the way they prepared it. 
--------------------
edit:
They have Lunch Platters with Kefta Kebobs for 6.99, so me and my mom went for that today. They gave us some pita bread before the meal. We had the kefta kabobs, which came with rice, hummus (it was pretty good, i usually don&#39;t like hummus but this one was alright), lebna (reminded me of tzatziki sauce but a little different - very good!), and some lettuce and tomatoes. The food was very good and filling. 
Also, we tried the kibbeh, which is fried Bulqur stuffed with spicy ground beef, with the lebna sauce and some lettuce. It was very good as well. It had a nice texture to it which was nice.

Definitely recommend the place. Sitting outside was awesome too, the weather was perfect today."

I was expecting the place to a trash hole based on the reviews, so we pushed off going there 4 times! I am glad we finally tried this place out. 

I am vegetarian so may be the meat here is bad, but the vegetarian food is really good! The falafel here is actually better than Pita Inn&#39;s falafel and I love Pita Inn&#39;s falafel. Mina&#39;s falafel almost feels fresher and tastier. Everything else including couscous were good as well. Pita Inn does have better spicy sauce.  

I might have given the place 3 stars if the other reviews were not completely off base. 3 star or 4 start, the bottom line is, go try out this place. You will not regret.

------ 
Update - one of the reviews talked about low salt in some of the dishes. I do agree with that. I think we added a little bit of salt in both Hummus and Baba Gonoosh.  I would take a little less salty than salty food anytime."

The food was alright. I ordered basic stuff because I read previous reviews and I saw the food wasn&#39;t that great. I got the giant pretzel, it came with beer cheese and grainy mustard &amp; chicken tenders. The pretzel was soft and warm. Probably the highlight of the whole experience.

This is how it should be done. People come here to watch sports and the World Series, just provide the audio and people will continue to come here. We don&#39;t want to watch the game without audio.

Staff:  the staff was great!  I let him know I had never been there, so needed a little guidance on selecting and he did a great job letting me choose my food.

Food:  I had combo #1 which were a couple of hot dogs with fries and a drink.  The hot dogs and buns are nothing spectacular.  The condiments however were fresh and piled high on them.  The fries on the other hand were amazing!  They have to be just about the best fries I&#39;ve had!

Serving Hot Dogs, Burgers and Italian Beef sandwiches, the menu should be very familiar to most native Chicagoans. The inside of this particular eatery is fairly clean with a few tables on the inside, an R.C/ Nehi pop machine and a large counter with a menu board above it and a long grill where the food is prepared.

In visiting Grando&#39;s I was looking to add yet another location to my hot dog review list. I decided to order a hot dog along with a burger and fries combo. We&#39;ll go over the hot dog first. The hot dog I received came on a slightly dry non-poppy seed bun. The sausage itself was skinless and tasted like I would expect but the application of condiments here was a bit rough. There was a little too much mustard, and the dog was light on relish and onions by comparison. The pickle spear used was a tad on the sour side. On the plus side, the tomato used wasn&#39;t too soggy or too ripe. There wasn&#39;t any noticeable celery salt, nor any sport peppers on this hot dog. 

The burger I got also had a dry bun. In fact the bun had actually cracked a bit on the top. The burger meat itself was a bit on the greasy side with how it was grilled. I&#39;d say the meat was juicy and had a good flavor, but it didn&#39;t exactly knock my socks off. The condiments on the burger were fairly good but it&#39;s generally a far less delicate process than with a hot dog. The fries included were thin shoestring fries. They were crisp but didn&#39;t have a lot of potato paste in them. I&#39;d say they were a bit saltier than most fries.

Overall I wasn&#39;t too impressed with Grando&#39;s Beef and Hot Dogs. The prices were slightly higher than a lot of other fast food joints. I&#39;d say the burger was about average and the hot dog was a bit below average. I do wonder how they&#39;re storing their hamburger and hot dog buns as both of the ones I received were dry and cracking.  One other thing worth noting is that they appear to be closed on Sundays and only open from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM on Saturdays. Somewhat limited hours on the weekend which is a bit of an added inconvenience. Overall while my experience at Grando&#39;s wasn&#39;t terrible, the food was just slightly below average. This place is a borderline between two and three stars. The fact that both buns were dry,  is going to be the proverbial &#34;straw that broke the camels back&#34; and cause me to round them down to two stars."

This is my usual &#34;go-to&#34; when i can&#39;t figure out what i want as there is a wide variety of your typical hot dog joint menu items.

The burgers are excellent and the hot dogs are good (Red Hot Chicago).  Wasn&#39;t too thrilled with the gyro&#39;s, but I am pretty partial to Grecian Delight brand and i think these were OLympia. They tasted like more filler than meat.

The place is run by an older lady and gentleman that are super friendly."

Glad I did - pretty nice find!

I ordered their featured burger - with bacon, onions and (cheddar) cheese. Generally I am NOT a big bacon fan on burgers - it&#39;s usually dried out and doesn&#39;t do much for me. But this was a whole pile of lightly cooked pork belly goodness that added a whole pile of flavor to the burger. I do wish there had been a tad more of a char-broiled taste and temp-wise, it wasn&#39;t perfect (my nephew ordered the same burger medium and his sat on the grill for maybe 5 secs more than my medium rare burger.

I asked the bartender which was the best &#34;starch option&#34; and she said she prefers the potato salad as it is homemade. So I went with that and it was pretty good. Plenty of refills on the soda pop - though they do hit you up for $3.10 each on those. Burger was a value at $11.99. 

Overall a good experience - I&#39;ll be back!!!"

We read the signs that claimed to have the best burgers, so we stopped in on a Saturday night. The decor is dated to say the least, with the exception of huge tvs adorning the wall. The service was fine. But overall the food was basic. I had the sample platter (stuffed mushrooms, potato skins, and buffalo wings). The stuffed mushrooms were disgusting. I took one bite and went no further. The other two were just average. My hubby had the char burger and he said there was nothing to rave about. It lacked any season. And then my dr. Pepper was flat. I mean, this place stays packed, for what reason I don&#39;t know. But if you want to pay for basic American food that is bland, this is your place.

Buff sauce tasted complex and not your standard overly spicy stuff they poor on at other places. I was most excited to try the 2 layer cheesecake which is made with a layer of cream cheese and a layer of sour cream cheese and topped with homemade raspberry sauce.

The Assembly is a close and convenient place to grab a bite with my Mother-in-Law. She typically gets the Grilled Ribeye Steak. It wasn&#39;t so impressive the first time around, but she got it with the special &#34;Char-Crust&#34; last time and I felt genuinely jealous of her meal choice since I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d like what I ordered that night.

Their basic burgers are just that and I&#39;m OK with it. I&#39;ve also tried the Macaroni &amp; Cheese Burger, but I don&#39;t think I saw it on the menu last time. It may have been a specialty item and I can&#39;t say as I&#39;m sad to see it go if that&#39;s the case. I&#39;m somewhat certain it was Kraft mac on top of an overcooked patty and sandwiched between a dry bun. I get down with the blue box every now and then, but it had no flavor when added to something that substantial.

I most recently had the Parmesan Burger and really enjoyed it. I upgraded to the pretzel bun but ended up deconstructing it and eating only the meat and toppings. For some reason the pretzel buns come out dry and are very dense. But it&#39;s so much food that you don&#39;t miss the bread.

Their appetizers are very large and our favorite is the Fried Pickles with their housemade ranch sauce.

I was really disappointed at our last trip out here because their giant TV flashed the Yelp logo and asked you to check in on the app before you paid your bill. I hadn&#39;t seen a Yelp promo pop up when I checked in before we went inside, so I checked my Yelp Deals page and didn&#39;t see anything listed for them there either. We asked our waitress and she had to ask another employee. We were basically told we were mislead by the wordage (at worst) or incorrectly assumed we&#39;d get a discount since it specifically mentioned the bill (at best). In essence, checking in here will do nothing more for you than show others you were there and promoted them, which you could really do at any time before or after the bill. So why mention it? &#34;Don&#39;t forget to check in on Yelp!&#34; or &#34;We&#39;re on Yelp!&#34; would be more fitting."

It was determined that I really needed to introduce my husband to this burger. Last night my husband (outfitted with his hamburger t-shirt) and parents went and it was a slice of nostalgia. This is a &#34;no frills&#34; joint. Per my hubby, The Original Char Burger lives up to the hype. I&#39;m vegetarian, and the portabella sandwich was very good.

The outside is about as a appealing as the u-haul building down the block. Walking in, you see miserable pool taking their turns at video slots. The bar area is reminiscent of Moe&#39;s tavern. Local men escaping wives looking for answers at the bottom of a brew are sat on alternating bar stools obeying the unwritten rules of the urinsls. Depressing. 

We sat down and felt a bit out of place. Not a crocs kinda place here. Our waitress sensed we were virgins here and immediately recommended the burgers. We started with the soup of the day; cream of broccoli. Delicious. Not too thick. Not too creamy and the broccoli was abundant. My French onion soup was terrific as well. Caramalized cheese stuck to the cup, fresh croutons, and onions which didn&#39;t over power the soup. Also had the Mozzarella triangles. Could have skipped it. Too brown. Not enough cheese pull on the bite. Just boring. 

The burger. Got the famous char something. This thing was huge. The beef was fresh and not beaten up. Cooked perfectly. Cheese. Bacon. Yes. There is some sort of a wine sauce they give you. Not sure what to do with so I dipped my fries and burger in it. It works. Really works. 

Most def will return. Out tab was $40. No drinks. Just pop. Including tip. A bit pricey for sure, but good food. Perhaps they can tidey up the place s bit. But maybe not. It&#39;s a comfortable depressing place with good good where you can eat your sorrows away."

However, after my visit today I doubt I&#39;ll return again. 

We stopped in on a quiet Saturday afternoon.
We were in the mood for the once excellent potato skins and a cup of French onion soup.

We sat in the bar area and ordered our drinks.
My guest ordered a beer, I a tomato juice on the rocks.
We also ordered a cup of the French onion soup.

We waited and waited for our drinks.
Guess what, the soup arrived before the drinks.
That right there, is a big no no in the restaurant industry.

Finally, our drinks magically appeared.
The tomato juice tasted like water. Imagine someone adding red dye to a water glass. That was sent back.
I was brought a diet Pepsi, flat as can be. That went back as well. 

Our soup was served hot, yet lacked flavor.
There was little to no crouton in the soup.
There was plenty of cheese, I&#39;ll give them that. 
However, they should be using Gruyere in place of the bland mozzarella they use.

Throughout the meal, our server was MIA. 
Drinks went dry with no service in sight. 

Next, we ordered an order of the once amazing potato skins. The plate came with four HALF skins smothered in cheese. Funny thing is, a few years back you would get eight half skins, for $6.99. Now, they cut that in half. Little to no bacon bits on the skins. Very bland and disappointing. 

Reluctantly, ordered the buffalo chicken tenders. Those too were a huge letdown. Way over cooked with sour food service &#34;blue cheese&#34; dressing. That too, was sent back. 

I used to be a huge fan of their burger, but did not order it since the food was so disappointing. Sorry, I can&#39;t comment on the current state of their burgers. However, I&#39;d assume they cut corners as far as taste and quality there as well. 

This place used to be my go to spot. If you&#39;re looking for food with flavor and good service, head down to the Lucky Monk. That&#39;s where all their once loyal customers are. 

Very disappointed in the decline of the taste and quality of the food. Service was absolutely appalling too. My tip to the owner, get off the wallet and bring the assembly back to the quality you had once prided yourself on. Then, I&#39;ll consider visiting again. 

Two Stars Considering the Manager removed the drinks and buffalo tenders from the bill."

The food wasn&#39;t bad, but I&#39;ve had better burgers and sandwhiches in this $10+ price range. In fact, even within a few hours of eating lunch -- I couldn&#39;t pinpoint any entree that left a lasting impression on me. 

Chicken rice soup bowl - This came out lukewarm, in a decent sized bowl. The chicken was a little overcooked, the broth lacked body to it, and the vegetables didn&#39;t do much to add flavor. 

Pulled pork - Lots of meat, but wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the sauce. A bit too sweet and didn&#39;t really go great with the pork -- the meat was prepared pretty well though.

Burgers - None of them really stood out much for me. The meat was ordered medium rare but was cooked closer to medium to medium-well (closer to pink than red and really didn&#39;t have much juices flowing out). The Char didn&#39;t taste too different from a normal burger, the flavor of the onions failed to make much of an impression. The Philly had a bit more flavor but really more because of the satueed peppers than anything else. Could really have used more seasoning to bring out a more hearty flavor. The parmesan I was expecting to be very rich and greasy/butter in flavor. Even this really didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor even with a highly visible coating. 

Tator tots, fries, waffle fries, housemade chips - Normally I wouldn&#39;t lump all the sides into a single category but these were so basic there&#39;s nothing particuarly interesting to mention about any of these.

The cole slaw was pretty good though -- creamy and a good amount of flavor (really more flavorful than the burgers). But that&#39;s not a strong reason to visit the restaurant.

Overall, the food is okay -- forgettable but prepared decently. I might visit if I&#39;m in the area but I wouldn&#39;t make a special trip here."

Came here for lunch for Father&#39;s Day.  We shared the sampler which was a pretty good size for the price.  A few families here with kids so it&#39;s good for kids it seems. And the bionic burger was juicy and on point. Thing was huge - and will have to take half home

It may look something like a dive from the outside but the food is all delicious. Burgers are a definite must, however, make sure you order it a step more cooked than you usually do.  For example, since I prefer my meat medium rare I order it medium.  This ensures my bun is not totally disinergrated by the time I get halfway through. 

The chicken sandwich is also great, always juicy, never dry.  I am not a fan of bbq so I order the honey mustard with extra so I can dip sweet potato fries in it. 

My husband swears by their french onion soup and Reubens, my co-workers won&#39;t try anything other than the parmesan burger,  my friend&#39;s mom visiting from Indiana (told you I take everyone) loved the bloody mary,  and my vegetarian BFF said that her last meal would include the fried zucchini. 

Favorites of mine include the turkey club, fried pickles or filet mignon quesadilla. This is also the only place (other than a school cafeteria) where I&#39;ve seen tator tots offered (and so much better than a school cafeteria, any of them). I used to crave their cobb salad but awhile ago they changed their plates to triangles and the portion isn&#39;t as big anymore. I&#39;m probably greedy but just don&#39;t feel like the value is as good for the salads anymore. All other portions are very generous. 

I don&#39;t drink so can&#39;t say much about the beer or alcohol situation although no one I have ever taken has complained about it. I have also never had their desserts because we are always too full,  but the friendly servers have said on more than one occasion that they&#39;re home made which is a plus in my book. 

Best burger ever? Definitely in my top 3 and most certainly the most convenient in the Hoffman /Schaumburg area. Really solid food and friendly service? Heck yeah.  Check it out!"

The place is a little older a little dim-lit but seems to have all the different things that you might want to munch on. They have different sports games going on and video music playing live. The staff seems to be very nice and I believe she was a manager also came to check on us. Definitely recommend the place. Just hold your opinions to yourself until you try it. It is not the usual.

You can get a serious burger and a pint. But if you really want a treat, snag the filet and bleu steak salad. Best price in all of Chicagoland.

My friend turns to me and suggests this establishment for a beer before her father arrives. Fortunately, he arrives to meet us at the storage unit so we didn&#39;t have the beer beforehand. I say fortunately because the experience would have been very different. After a game of furniture Tetris in a clown car, this was the right choice. 

This place is obviously a local gem. We chose to eat at the bar, but there is a dining room. Stacy was our bartender &amp; Jim manned the grill. When we sat at the bar, Stacy gave us the most genuine smile, and took our drink orders. When she returned with the drinks, she gave a round of introductions to the others working in her station. Stacy was sweet &amp; spoke to you with the ease of an old friend. Jim was a beast on the grill. The thing about sitting at the bar is that you get to watch every burger go onto an open flame grill. And, honestly, what&#39;s sexier than meat and fire? You can watch as red and orange flames reach through the grates of the grill to caress 10 oz patties. We&#39;re not talking about the flare ups when your uncle barbecues in the backyard and turns what was once beautiful flesh into burnt leather. No, this is the gentle build up of passion between lovers that eventually and naturally crescendos into flame, which brings me to the food itself. 

This establishment is famous for its burgers. A lot of places claim a good burger, but very few deliver. The Assembly makes one of the best burgers I have experienced in my life. The ground beef they use is beautiful. The flavor makes it obvious that before old Bessie was on my plate, she lived a happy life, and Jim prepared her with the deference  she deserved. I like my burgers medium rare which is a sometimes trying experience. Jim cooked it perfectly &amp; timed it with my less primal carnivorous friends so that all four of our burgers arrived at the same time to the doneness we specified. There was silence where there had been girlish gossip once we each took our first bites. I could have been struck down after my first bite and I would have died happy. 

From what I can gather, pretty much everything they make is going to be delicious. From their appetizers we got fried pickles, onion strings &amp; mozzarella triangles -all were wins ( the fried pickles the biggest winner). The menu offers a lot and I wish we could have spent a few weeks going item by item. The only thing I would recommend against are the French fries or waffle fries. Get the tater tots instead. 

It is obvious why this place has been around for as long as it has. There was a steady line during peak dinner hours while we were there. Everyone was friendly, including the manager (maybe owner?) clad in a tight cheetah print top and black pants who suddenly appear to check on how we were enjoying our experience. It was almost cartoonish in that one moment there was nothing, and then there she was. Her concern was genuine, albeit her manner a little odd, but endearing. 

If you happen to be in the north suburbs, or you decide &#34;heck yeah, let&#39;s make a trip for free furniture,&#34; go to The Assembly. If it&#39;s probably going to be your only visit, get the fried pickles and a burger with tater tots. Don&#39;t even look on the other side of the menu because it will only lead to heartache. If you can, sit at the bar. Watch Jim cook your meat, laugh a bit with Stacy, and enjoy. 

*There was another bartender there, too who was also friendly, but I unfortunately forgot her name."

I had quick, kind service, good recommendations, and a generally pleasant dining experience due to an always-smiling young waitress whose name escapes me. 

I do not eat hamburgers very often, but given the raving reviews for the burgers here, I decided to try their classic char burger, and it was amazing: juicy, crisp, perfectly cooked and accompanied by bacon, swiss cheese and sautéed onions, served on an optional pretzel bun. I started with the chili, which was also delicious. 

I especially liked that I was able to get fruit on the side instead of their fries, tater tots, and other choices. They sounded delicious, but the burger was quite enough calories for a single meal. More likely half the day. The price was very reasonable for the fare, about $20. I was here on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, but I can imagine that on a Friday night, this is the place to be. I can see why The Assembly gets such rave reviews, and while the food is good, I felt welcomed, and that is not nearly as common as a good sandwich."

Well....we won&#39;t be taking anyone else.  First, our server Patti, she was good, might have taken her a bit to take our order after the apps and drinks order but that was ok.  Once we got going she made sure we were ok so for her a solid 4 stars!

IT was hot in the restaurant, now it was hot outside no problem, but I was sweating sitting in the back...there was a fly or flies buzzing around that just made the meal a little off.  NOW don&#39;t get me wrong the meal was tasty, though my one son did have an issue with his bun falling apart and the owner did come over and told us our server should have suggested another type of bun, that was ok.  When we got home within an hour we were all getting sick...now we can&#39;t be sure it was the fault of the food, though that was the only thing that we ate in common that day.  I&#39;m  going to keep an open mind but watching my kids get sick was not putting me in my happy place.  They are much better this morning as are my wife and I, now she wasn&#39;t as bad but she didn&#39;t have a burger like the rest of us...all in all we won&#39;t be going back.

I know they are an established restaurant in the area and we pass them no less than twice a day so I will chalk this one up to bad for us, hopefully good for everyone else."

Had a taste for a burger and gave them a try tonight.

I really don&#39;t like giving bad reviews when the staff works hard and is pleasant. At the assembly, the bartender is also the cook. This makes it difficult for good service and in my experience the food was not edible.

The burger I ordered was one of the worst in memory. I took two bites, spit the first bite into my napkin because it was raw, the bartender re-cooked it,  I took another bite and called it a night. Apparently she was training so I accepted her offer for a take away box but never utilized it.

The meat was very low quality beef, the pretzel bun was soggy, the tomatoes were not ripe and had zero taste.

$22 + tip also leaves me with a bad taste."

Apparently The Assembly is doing so well that they can turn business away because they&#39;re too lazy to take a phone order.  Or, perhaps they just think they&#39;re too cool for school now that you can place orders online on their website. Won&#39;t be getting any more business from anyone in our office which is just across the street.  We used to frequent for Happy Hour often.

As I said I crept in here clenching hoping to pinch a loaf and jet but after I was on empty I decided why not refill!  Their bathroom was sort of dark and I usually hate bathrooms where I can hear other dudes lose a few pounds but this wasn&#39;t as bad as the Starbucks across the street, Christ that bathroom was like a steam bath.  I&#39;m assuming because of all the coffee trots people leave there.
So after I brought the Cleveland Browns to the Super Bowl, I strained up an appetite so I stayed, I sat at the bar and decided I haven&#39;t been drunk in 8 hours so I got a long island ice tea, I hated that it pretty much all came out of a premix which the thought of that made me wanna shoot myself but I tried it cause I&#39;m a great drinker and I needed to relax a bit after all that anger dropping I just did.  Ya know what, it wasn&#39;t so bad.  I&#39;ve had worse I used to drink straight tequila, talk about your bathroom trips...Yikes!
After I was knee deep in booze I ordered a bacon cheese burger on a pretzel bun and fries.  The bar tender made my burger, I was happy to see they didn&#39;t cut corners on the food like they did on the booze.  I like my food like I like my woman, greasy!  It didn&#39;t let me down, either did the cutie who tried picken me up and bringing me to the LaQuinta for a buck and a quarter... We&#39;re talking high class!  Oh man I can&#39;t describe enough just how very hot thick and juicy the meat was and at one point the juices dribbled down my chin but enough about the after party. 
This was a very well rounded meal.  I am excited to say I&#39;ll be back and told many other people so far how good this experience was.  I can&#39;t believe I have never tried them before!  I feel like I&#39;ve missed out!
Everything here was really not as bad as I thought it was going to be especially after tripping over the folks in line to lose money at the slots machine the food and booze were good but considering what else I&#39;ve put in my mouth maybe I&#39;m not one you should listen to.

I was very disappointed today for lunch!   The medium burger I ordered was completely well done with no juices left.  Thus the meat was void of much flavor having had it cooked out. The sesame seed bun seemed beyond a few days old.  The 20. tab for a burger, soft drink and tip not value worthy.
I would of been much more satisfied at Portillo&#39;s for under 8.00.

When I&#39;m not sure about something, I tend to go conservative. They have a decent selecdtion on their menu but I was focused on trying a hamburger.

All burgers are 10oz, cooked your way and about $1 an ounce. I asked for a cheeseburger. It arrives without lettuce, onion and tomato. Just a side of pickles. Yes, with downward fist motion towards abdomen, my favorite condiment on a cheeseburger!

A cheeseburger comes with choice of cheddar, American or Swiss cheese. I upgraded my regular bun and choice of side off their list for a pretzel bun and seasoned waffle fries. The fries had too much salt sprinkled on them!

Jason ordered from their Sunday Specials&#39; board: Texas BBQ Chicken sandwich with an upgrade of waffle fries.

I have to say they have remained consistent.  I remember the chili tasting the same.  And the side of coleslaw and mushroom sauce with my burger.  The burger is big and tasted good.  I should have paid an extra dollar for a better bun. But really they charge a dollar bun upgrade?!  The place is cute and great service.  The restaurant was busy. A good place to have dinner before a movie down the street at the AMC.

Maybe I went on an off night for them? The waitress wasn&#39;t very attentive and the place seemed very understaffed. The food was just okay. I wanted the burgers to be a lot better then they were.

I had read reviews of the Bionic Burger and the French Onion soup. Let me say this, the reviews don&#39;t quite do it justice.  
The Assembly looks like your typical sports bar/pub.  Maybe a little older looking, but that is fine. It gives it character.  The smell of wood smoke inside is welcoming, not strong (and I will walk out of places that are too smoky).  Here it is like an appetizer, you know if you food is cooked on that it will be good.

I read a review for their French Onion soup and it is indeed really, really good.  Is it the best? I don&#39;t know. But it is certainly in my top 3, and the best I have had for twice the price.

The Bionic Burger is mess. A wonderful tasty mess.  I the onions, cheese and bacon melt to form this perfect crown on 10oz of beef.  The burger beef was good all on it&#39;s own.  The mushroom-cherry sauce (on the side) was fun and added a nice little hint of &#34;other&#34; to the burger.  I got the sesame seed bun, I think next time I will opt for the pretzel bun.  We also had at our table a regular burger and a bacon cheese burger.  All very, very excellent.  I went with the waffle fires, but others got the tater tots.  The tots were better.  

Our waitress, Patti, was very good. Quick, attentive, let us know about all the specials and options.  Quick on the drink refills and getting our table cleared. Perfect professional.

All in all a great choice and I think they are secure in their claim as having the best burgers in the Northwest suburbs."

Burger was decent, seems like a burger they pulled out of the freezer and plopped on the grill. Decent grill taste, but no spices, or nothing to differentiate this burger from anywhere else that serves a frozen burger. 

Service was decent enough, but nothing great or out of the ordinary. 

Fried pickles were decent, but could have definitely used more breading. In an area with plenty of good restaurants, I see no reason to go back."

It is kinda dark and warm inside but the smells are enticing! My waitress was super friendly and made some great suggestions!
I ordered the bacon cheese burger, medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly! They give you a delicious mushroom-onion sauce that seeps into the meat which was juicy and tender. 
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the best burger in the world but it&#39;s the best burger i&#39;v ever had! I&#39;v had better fries but they have so many side choices it doesn&#39;t matter!

I am a fan of this place.  It is right up my alley.  My first  visit, I ordered the Char Burger medium rare with the pretzel bun (after an earlier  review, I was ready to ask for it out of the blue, but the bartender had the whole list of options ready).  I was leery after watching the amount of seasoning was being applied but those concerns were soon to be discarded.

The cheese was nicely melted on the grill, for my coveting view, under the dome of a small grill lid.  My only demerit would be the bacon did not get enough time on the grill itself to release some of the wonderfulness hidden in the recesses of the delightful, wavy, marbled edges of flavor filled fat.  The burger was rather juicy, hot and very tasty.  The right amount of fat from the burgar worked with the application of seasoning to work itself into a hungry turned satisfied belly.

I dug in as soon as I was allowed and was wondering about my fries, which came from the kitchen right after I was served the burger.  I could tell they were not as fresh from the fryer as my burger and felt they needed to be eaten rather quickly to gain any tasteful satisfaction.(this is my 3.50 star review.)

My next visit, nearly 2 weeks later, I decided for a lighter affair than the first.  I ordered the reuben sandwich with fries.  I feel I had chosen wisely.  

The corned beef was perfectly done as well as the kraut and cheese delightfully covering it whilst caressing the sides until creating a protective stance upon my plate.  It was juicy and flavorful to the end.

The fries, this time, came upon the plate with the sandwich.  I do not know if they attempt to time up all the dishes to appear at the same time or just make a batch when they make a batch.  The reason I question it is that these fries obviously came right out of the fryer.  You may say, &#34;that is a good thing, right?&#34;  As a former cook, it is not.  It means I was lucky, because the guy next to me who ordered a little later, had the same quality of fires I had my first visit.  It is a time saving technique but often backfires on slow days and hurts with critical assessments.

But, I am being too nit picky.  I still give an overall 4 on this place.  The service along with the follow through of the staff and the quality of the main fair overcomes the short comings of the side, in my opinion.

This is a solid place and I will be back as often as I can."

If my wife and I hadn&#39;t already had drinks already ordered before being told the french dip was no longer on the menu, we would have left. The only reason we stopped in was for the french dip.

Saturday evenings- you cannot get a seat at the bar and the wait for dining tables is also long- a good sign of good food.

I have been visiting the Assembly since 1996 and lived through its ownership changes and year after year it was a &#34;must go&#34; destination for good food and at one time, micro brews!

The appetizers arrived and unfortunately they were average at best.  The Assembly has always been known for their amazing Chili.  Some how they have managed to screw up this classic of staple on the menu.  The Chili was less dense, flavorful  and was rather soupy.

We then ordered the Char Burger, Bionic Burger, and two Cheeseburgers.  All came rare...too rare (almost) to eat.   The grilled onions were barely grilled and they were served up on cafeteria white buns.  WTF!?!  

The server never even offered Marble Rye, Pretzel or any other bread option.  Do they even have those options any longer?

What was once a GREAT must GO to place,  has now devolved into a &#34;so so&#34; restaurant...at best.
.  
The ambiance of the place remains pretty much the same, the bathrooms were VERY clean (so that shows someone is paying attention) and they now have Video Gaming so if you are into that, and less concerned about the quality of food, this place may be an option for you.   

After spending $115.00 for lunch for food and drinks (Guinness, Stella, Cokes) I didn&#39;t leave feeling like I got my monies worth.

It is very 1980&#39;s inside and out. I felt like I walked into a time warp and should have teased my hair big. When I came on Sunday night, I first saw some video game machines. Upon walking in further, I noticed a pretty empty dining and bar area. Without much chattering going on, I was able to hear the 1980&#39;s music that played all night--lots of Journey, Duran Duran, etc. As I waited to order, I noticed very old 70&#39;s paneling throughout the restaurant and lots of flat screen televisions conveniently located. 

Now on to the food and drinks. I ordered a mimosa which was excellent--strong orange and champagne taste. The appetizer I had was the fried zucchini, which tasted a lot like potato chips. It was served with Parmesan cheese sprinkled over it. It was enjoyable, but I&#39;m not going to rave about it. Since the Assembly is known for having a great burger, I decided to order a plain hamburger and judge for myself. As my side dish, I chose the french fries. The burger came with a wine sauce on the side, as well as very fresh and perfectly chopped raw onion, tomato, and lettuce. The burger itself was gargantuan. I ordered it cooked medium and it was very soft and pink inside; the meat almost fell apart. It was very meaty, and I think the wine sauce added a nice touch. Definitely a great burger but not my all-time favorite. Nonetheless, I think I will return to the Assembly. The menu contains a great variety of items and many different burgers."

Their burgers are quite good and I&#39;ve had some of the best ribs ever here.  I&#39;ve even had some soups which I found surprisingly delicious for a local bar &amp; grill.  Their fish fry isn&#39;t anything to write home about, just &#34;okay&#34;..frozen breaded fish fried up for you - definitely not fresh.

I&#39;ve tried a few of their burger varieties but I always go back to their Char Burger. Cooked right in front of you if you sit and order at the bar. Special char seasoning sprinkled on before charred to perfection on searing hot gas powered steel open grill. It is served with their special mushroom sherry wine sauce. Wash that monster burger down with some of their micro brew or your favorite beer and you will be absolutely content. I&#39;ve had better burgers before but this place is close to me and world class.

We were lucky enough to find a few seats open at the bar (the only two vacant seats we&#39;d seen available all night) and were waited on immediately despite the full house.  The genius of this place lies in the massive grill they have right behind the bar to grill up orders for those seating there immediately.  I&#39;m sure it makes for a lot of work for the bartenders who are cooking up the grub, but the patrons benefit since they get their food faster and hotter than average, too!  

The atmosphere is cool (I think, anyway) because it reminds me of one of my parents&#39; generation supper clubs.  Old school character mixed with friendly service and good food earns four stars from me every time. Check it out for yourself and see if you don&#39;t agree!"

And then I was like &#34;oooooh, yeah, I know that place&#34;

My husband, kids, and I went here on a Sunday evening around 6:30.  Although the parking lot was more crowded than I&#39;ve seen it, we got seated right away--a big plus in my book.  It seemed like a comfy atmosphere--there were couples, families, birthday parties, a bar area.  It just seemed like everyone was having a great time!

So let&#39;s start with the nachos.  In my expert nacho opinion, they&#39;re not really worth it.  The chips got soggy really quickly, and the chips were just &#34;meh&#34;.  My husband is not as picky about nachoes, and even he said they were just &#39;ok&#34;.  He did LOVE their house brewed beer, though!

For our meals, I got the Southwestern Salad, which was REALLY good!!  The lettuce was crisp and fresh, and I liked the blackening on the chicken.  And there was no skimping on the chicken, here, either!!  My husband ordered the Poblano burger, and it had NO spiciness to it, which he was very disappointed with.  He likes spicy things!

The kids meal was SUPER cheap.  I think it was $3 and it came with a drink, macaroni and cheese, and garlic bread.  Which my daughter loved all of!  Don&#39;t expect gormet mac n cheese, though, I believe it was Kraft.  But soooo worth not having to cook.

Ok, now do yourself a favor.  If you go here, try the mousse.  Seriously.  Go now.  Eat the mousse.  It is so light and fluffy and flavorful.  My husband is not really into desserts, and he thought it was awesome.  So go mousse it up!

But the good (not fantastic food), great service (I could have put our waitress in my pocket, she was so cute) and good ambience makes this restaurant a four-star experience!!"

At least, for a restaurant. Adorable.

The draft list is pretty standard bar fare, and they were out of their special so I ended up with a 312. Could be worse. My dinner was a bacon cheeseburger which I was pleasantly surprised to find was thick, pink, flavorful and overall just delicious. Well done, guys! I mean medium rare, amiright?! It was served with their &#34;special&#34; mushroom onion sherry wine sauce which was, quite honestly, bad. Not a dealbreaker though as it comes on the side.

The Assembly is a very good option for Hoffman Estaters looking for a tasty (if uninspiring) burger mixed with holiday kitsch."

A big square bar smack in the middle, with a grill in the middle of the bar. (yeah, read that again)

....where you can watch to make sure no one spits in your burger as the bartender grills your food inbetween pouring beers. SWEET!

Our bartender, Karen, made something out of TV&#39;s food network without blinking an eye and then proceeded to make sure everyone&#39;s drinks were filled before she was asked, all while carrying on multiple conversations...

The food itself is in the 2.5 to 3.0 star range -- but it&#39;s also priced very appropriately. The extra bump is because you get huge portions of homemade food for a very reasonable price, friendly service, and fast preparation. If you&#39;re also a student at Hersey, the prices get even better as there&#39;s tons of incentives for lunch and football games.

When I visited here, I thought to myself -- this is the restaurant I wish I had next to my high school when growing up. With all the deals, there&#39;s a ton of ways to get filled up for around $5 with also many different ways to get coupons and other specials if you&#39;re not a student. The dining room is a fairly good size and easy to reconfigure if you have a large party. There&#39;s a lot of different choices of Chicago favorites, many of which use home-made preparations, so there&#39;s really something for everyone.

As the food items are priced at or below what you&#39;d be paying for fast food elsewhere, you&#39;re really getting a good deal if you&#39;re ordering the hamburger or hot dog meal here. It&#39;s prepared with all the condiments you&#39;d expect from a more expensive version and comes in a generous size. I do wish there was an element of char or something else for more flavor on the meat though. The pizza was alright -- thin crispy crust, fairly generous amounts of meat. This may be one of the few times I could say that I&#39;d actually prefer if it was a little more salty or had a touch of seasoning to make it more savory. 

The meatball sandwhich came in with huge meatballs, which is probably large enough to feed two people. With a fluffier handpacked meat texture, it was definitely homemade. The garlic knots were pretty addictive -- surprisingly not too overwhelming with a generous amount of garlic, cheese, and butter on them. This is probably due to the use of real garlic instead of garlic seasoning, which definitely shows when you take a bite. The handcut fries were slightly crispy, a bit too moist for my preference -- probably cooked in vegetable instead of peanut oil. The chocolate chip cookie was a good way to finish the meal, given its size really a small meal in itself.

Overall, you&#39;re getting better food than you&#39;d be getting elsewhere at this price. Fresh and homemade instead of flavors you&#39;d be getting from chain restaurants -- and supporting the local community at the same time. Definitely give this place a visit if you live in the area."

Super thin crusts taste great and firmly support the balanced toppings adorning the face of their creations.

The craziness that is the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza is now a sort of FAVORITE. Though I would not order it as the only pizza for the night, it definitely adds a new flavor profile to the mix. Pickles and mustard. Bacon. Intriguing, but I think it needs a tomato sauce of sorts... ketchup maybe? It would be wonderful if they actually found a way to make it look like a giant cheeseburger... but who am I kidding. Maybe a Kuma&#39;s Corner collaboration can happen? That could be epic... just saying...

On to the taco pizza. Just as the name suggests but the meat wasn&#39;t very taco-y. Needed some salsa and sour cream... guacamole, too... then it was spectacular.

The polynesian is on the mark. The teriyaki sauce is killer and the blend of chicken and pineapple was perfect. Nice sizes and amounts of the meat and fruit made this quite enjoyable.

Regular pies are artfully assembled to look like somebody really loves making pizza. Some places simply toss ingredients onto the top but Lola&#39;s seems to bring in a structural engineer and full Ty Pennington design team. The results are well-balanced colors and textures swirled with dazzling flavors that pop and pull you into eating more than you should.

Thanks."

We ordered a Chicago style hotdog, boneless wings, and fried mac and cheese bites. The food wasn&#39;t amazing but it wasn&#39;t the worst. The reason being is the food took an hour and a half to be delivered. We ordered through the yelp app and it was estimated 35-45 minute delivery. We ordered at 10:01 and at 11:05 we still hadn&#39;t received our food. We called only to find out that they had closed and were not picking up the phone. We called the yelp app, they got a hold of them and told us that the food was on the way. 11:18 I called again, they answered and I asked if I could just cancel the order because i knew the food would be cold by now. The person on the phone said &#34;ummm ummmm ummmmm we are sorry it will be there in a little&#34; I asked once again do I have to pay for the food since it&#39;s been an hour and a half.

Used to love their sausage pizza, but last time ordered it was more of a crumbly meatball-like topping, not too appetizing.  Certain counter staff haven&#39;t been consistent about saying words to customers to begin the order-taking process.  No &#34;hi&#34; or &#34;what would you like,&#34; just silent eye contact.  Had a experience too where I was quoted an hour wait time for a pickup order, actually only took 25 minutes.  Not really a problem there, but an indication of still some kinks to work out it seems.

Things that are still positive: Good pizza crust.  Have nice beer and wine selection, including some draft.  Service to the tables is still good and nice.  Generally friendly staff (again just the random anomalies listed above).  Cheap slices on Mondays.  Good location.  Nice environment to enjoy a meal.

To start the experience out, called for delivery,  was informed there was no delivery driver until 5pm. I figured that I was going to order from someplace else, instead the team at Lola&#39;s comes up with a solution and my food is on the way!

Cheddar bacon cheese fries were fantastic, great creamy cheese salty crisp bacon, the only thing that would have made it better is if I were eating it after a night of drinking as opposed to at work.

Only tried a slice of the pizza as the cheese fries filled me up, but I would recommend the beer crust over the regular thin crust if you are doing a 12&#34; pizza, the crust itself has great flavor.

She explained to each that we were having approximately 60 people and needed pizza and salad.  Lola&#39;s gave the best price, and we have a saved voicemail message from Maxine, who said specifically that the price included 8 family style pizzas which are 18 inches each, two catering salads, plastic silverware, plates, napkins and delivery charge.  We were happy to find a good price and be able to use a local, family-owned business.

Several days before the party AF called the pizza place to discuss updated numbers (the number of guests went down slightly), exact timing, toppings, etc.  AF asked for vegetarian, mushroom, etc. which Maxine explained were more expensive, so AF said that was fine and she would take the more basic pizza selections (such as cheese, pepperoni, etc.) instead.  The big issue started when Maxine stated that the salads included were only family salads that feed 4-5 people each (8-10 total).  AF was confused and inquired further and was eventually told a new price in order to feed salad to all guests that was about 50% higher!

She re-listened to the old voicemail she saved, confirming that the quote received in September was for two catering salads, not family salads.  AF called back the next day to ask about the difference between family salads and catering salads, and was told again that for the original price they were only going to include two family salads, and how much more the catering salads would be that would feed all the guests.  AF said she had a recorded voicemail message from Maxine herself that stated the price included two catering salads.  Maxine then gave a long and confusing explanation stating that Lola&#39;s has changed their catering menu, the catering salad definition changed, and what was called a catering salad then is now only a family salad. What they now call a catering salad feeds more and is more expensive. Despite AF being frustrated at the bait and switch Maxine would not budge.

A day or two later RT called since AF had had enough.  RT told Maxine we would not be going through with an order for 50% more than quoted and was very frustrated and upset with the situation.  Without warning Maxine&#39;s husband Bruce was on the line with a very negative tone.  To be fair, RT did not have a positive tone either, but as a customer expected something more understanding and apologetic from a small business owner.  Bruce said that they would never offer a price like the original one for that many people, and said mockingly to think about how little that would come to per person, $x.xx, and that they couldn&#39;t eat that cost.  RT mentioned they had a voicemail and Bruce said he wanted to hear it.

RT played the voicemail message for Bruce that clearly stated the original price and all of the details (including the catering salads, quantity and size of pizzas, etc). Bruce paused and tried to say the original price was for children only, they thought this was a party only for kids.  This made no sense and RT corrected him that this was never the case.  He then went on to say the price quoted was only for cheese pizzas, not speciality pizzas.  I said again that this was not for speciality pizzas, we only wanted cheese and basic toppings at most, but that AF was told by Maxine that the price difference was concerning the salad sizes.  Bruce said he did not know about that, and continued a rude tone even though he was proved wrong by the voicemail message that in fact they did offer a price of $x.xx per person which earlier he said neither he nor any pizza place would do.

By this point RT did not trust Bruce considering his tone and that he and his wife had offered three contrasting explanations on why they were not honoring their original quote. Bruce said he wanted to still do business with us but RT said he was unhappy with the customer service and would instead go with another business.  Bruce said he learned a lesson that he needed to provide formal quotes in writing in the future.  RT also mentioned that he felt the need to post reviews about this experience to let family, friends and community members know.  Bruce became irate at this and asked, &#34;Are you threatening me?&#34;

In the end RT said they would not do business with them due to the changing price, false explanations about the price, and poor customer service so he did not trust they would fulfill the order properly at any price.  He wished Lola&#39;s good luck and RT and AF chose a pizza place who honored their original quote from September with no problems that was for less than the extra 50% that Lola&#39;s wanted to charge for some unknown, changing reason.

We are having to spend more money and time than planned and are very sorry we became involved with Lola&#39;s Pizza Palace.  We strongly recommend for people to not be customers of this establishment, and especially do not consider using them to cater any type of event."

Would definitely order from here again. Very friendly manager. They did not charge full price for 1/2 of the pizza having an extra topping.

Lola&#39;s is in the Prospect Crossings shopping center, on Thomas off Rand Road. It&#39;s behind Target, and across the street from Hersey High School. It&#39;s near Jimmy John&#39;s and Allstate. MapQuest &amp; iPhone map have you going 1/2 mile further north on Rand. (Probably because the store is in a shopping mall behind the Target store on Rand.) Would be nice if on line maps had actual knowledge of strip mall addresses."

It is sometimes hard to decide because we like it all. We love the thin crust pizza. The crust is crispy and the sauce has great flavor. The salads are very plentiful and you have the option to build your own. YOU choose what you want in it. They have their own &#34;Lola&#39;s&#34; dressing - my family&#39;s favorite. The burgers are to die for. The quality of the 1/2 pound steakburger gives it a delicious taste. The sausage in the combos is moist, not dry and the beef is not overcooked. Then there are the fries. I can just go on and on. I would recommend giving Lola&#39;s a try. You will not be disappointed."

I was given the perfect opportunity tonight since I was still snowed in from the previous nights blizzard of 2015. 
Blame that on a snow blower mishap...

I ordered the 12 piece wings hot. 
Grilled chicken sandwich.
Chicago Style hot dog.

1st ~ Wings were big, cooked perfectly, and with tons of flavor. 
2nd ~ Grilled chicken was juicy, not dry. I usually avoid chicken since it&#39;s usually cooked beyond belief, but this was perfect. 
3rd ~ The Chicago Style Hot Dog. This, my friends, IS a hot dog. 

Now  bear with me.....
When I was a little girl back in the 1970&#39;s, after church my father would take the family to a hot dog stand in Wheeling called Peeps. It was on Rand Road, I believe. They had THE BEST hot dogs.
And RELISH. 
Let&#39;s not underestimate the power of a good relish and pickles on a hot dog. 

After behaving like good Catholic children at church, our reward was an awesome hot dog. 

One that would make you behave (and drool) thinking about it at church. 
 That perfect hot dog whose skin would pop the moment your front teeth bit into it. 
The juice that would slightly run causing you to reach for a napkin. 
Celery salt delicately sprinkled.
A bun that melted in your mouth.

Peeps closed their doors years ago.

When I bit into Lola&#39;s hot dog, I had the same memories of Peeps. 
The relish and pickles they use are so old fashioned and yummy!
My mouth was so happy and my brain was in Heaven. 

My father would sing your hot dog&#39;s praises.
He was an expert at hot dogs.
And Ice Cream.
But that&#39;s a different review."

You questioned why we didn&#39;t say anything- perhaps you overlooked our initial statement - the person behind the counter could not have been nastier to us, why would we go back and ask for more? If this was a handmade crust, I would be shocked, it was hard and tasteless. If you are questioning if I am real, yes we are - I post great reviews as well as disappointing ones. I still have the other groupon and no, I wont use it. We have many other choices in town.

Nice deep red too, and very tasty. The bottom was golden brown and slightly crispy, but not hard. My children had two of there kids meals. Nice size burger about the size of mcd&#39;s and a nice portion of fries for 4.99. It&#39;s a great deal and their pizza is not cheap but it is not overpriced either.

It took 30 minutes to get our first drink and a full hour (and several times of asking) to get water. Our waitress only came back about once every 45 minutes so you had to order your drinks before you were even ready for one because you weren&#39;t sure when she would be back."

Now, if they would open on time, that would be superb.  I sat in the parking lot for 15 minutes waiting for them to unlock, to no avail.  Come on guys, open on time.  Can&#39;t be that hard, right?  Right?  Not everyone wants their beer only at night."

It was a different atmosphere than I was expecting; it felt like I should be in Lakeview or Wrigleyville rather than Schaumburg. The beer selection was massive (or something bigger than massive or ginormous). The food was a very pleasant surprise! The meatball appetizer was delicious (and good sized) and the pizza was excellent. It was smaller than I was expecting but more filling than I thought. There was a live musician which meant it was very loud (my husband and I opted to sit on the small patio area). Overall, a good find! The next time some friends visit we will be taking them here!"

We just moved to Schaumburg and this one is nice and convenient for us in a town where &#34;regular&#34; bars and so seldom. We&#39;ve actually been there twice in the last three days. Friday and Sunday. It&#39;s a small place in a strip mall, so it kind of gets lost between Floyd&#39;s Barber Shop and whatever else is next door (see? I don&#39;t even remember!). It&#39;s totally great though, so many beers on tap and in bottles (with flights available!), as well as beer cocktails, pizzas, desserts... You can totally spend several hours here. Each time we went, though, at least one of our beer selections wasn&#39;t available. But, the waitresses we had were quick to give good alternatives for our original orders. 

The only real downfall is that the parking lot, even though fairly large, it&#39;s almost too small! The food options (On The Border, Giordano&#39;s) in the parking lot definitely kill the whole parking lot situation. Friday evening was busy and there wasn&#39;t a lot of parking left. There also weren&#39;t many tables left - there were only 2 open tables when we got there, so we got lucky! Sunday (today) happened to be their St. Baldrick&#39;s event, but we were lucky enough to get there just before it started to grab a table. 

All in all, I really do recommend The Beer Market. It&#39;s awesome for any beer lover! (And wine lover -- there are a few wines on the menu, too!)"

Overall, if you&#39;re looking for a relaxing, but fun night out, I recommend this place; although, if you&#39;re anything like me who is always indecisive, I recommend having someone choose your beer for you--the menu is &#39;never-ending.&#39;"

I personally wouldn&#39;t order one of those at a bar because of the price but they are there.  When I went they happened to be having a barrel aged beer theme so they had about ten of them on tap.

It&#39;s great that the menu is broken down by varieties of beer and that details such as ABV, location, and the style of glass that it&#39;s served in are alll included. I tried three different beers, including Czechvar and a Three Floyd&#39;s Yum Yum, but the Brickstone APA from Bourbonnais became my go to. An excellent pale ale. Excellent brew and one that I hope will stay on the menu. Who knew anything good could come from Bourbonnais?!

For food, I tried two varieties of wings, the reaper sauce and the dry rubbed. The reaper ones didn&#39;t taste like much, They were pretty soft and the sauce had a little heat, but not a ton of flavor. But the dry rubs were pretty good. It was a peppery blend with some salt and garlic. They were well cooked, but not a wing that knocked me out. Maybe if I return, I&#39;ll go for the pizza."

And then maybe 6-ish more pages to all the cans and bottles. I liked that you could create your own beer flight, but ended up just going with a glass of a local wheat beer. We shared the barbarian pretzel and the art-i-goat dip. The dip wasn&#39;t my favorite but I loved the pretzel. I&#39;m amazed the pretzel can be that massive but still come out with the perfect texture. It paired wonderfully with the cheese dip which had a surprising bit of kick to it. The pizzas I saw at some of the other tables looked really good too. If I lived here I&#39;d definitely be back. It&#39;s a great, casual hangout spot."

An amaaaaaing beer selection - wahoo! Had the dry rub wings - they were tasty, but I think they should still come with some sort of dipping sauce. The Arti-goat dip was delicious and the bread crispy. The interior was perfect - dark wood tables and long bar. Not a huge place but they had about twenty-five tables and twenty more seats at the bar. Was pleasantly surprised since others said it was small.

Tuesday night trivia always was a good time - and they&#39;d offer some pretty good specials on other days of the week. This bar has one of the better beer selections I&#39;ve seen for a suburban bar. And the ability to customize flights is fantastic.  

While the food menu was somewhat limited at the time we used to stop in - what they serve up is awesome; the pretzel and the goat cheese dip are really good for apps and the pizzas are very tasty, especially the Goodfella. We would routinely get multiple of those."

Prices run about $5.50 - $9 on the regular menu, and around $4/bottle for the &#34;last call&#34; menu.

We got the pretzel (how can you not?), and it was delicious. Easily twice the size of my head and full of soft buttery heaven; it smells and tastes like Auntie Anne&#39;s on steroids but less sweet -- more pretzel/bread-y. It comes with two dipping sauces - one cheese and a creamy mustard - and it&#39;s all fantastic while hot. About 30-45 minutes later, it got very cold and could kill someone if you threw it. Bummer, but sort of a blessing in disguise, so you don&#39;t try to eat the whole thing.

One thing to point out on the Maisel&#39;s Weiss -- The menu lists it as 12oz, which was why I opted for it instead of the others. I was charged for a 16 (and actually did get 16oz, I just had no idea). He served me a draft without asking. I am not normally a beer drinker, so I would have never thought to ask and make sure I was actually getting a 12oz-- since that&#39;s what was written. I wish the waiter would have asked me beforehand, as he would have seen how clueless I am and we could have sorted it out in the beginning. He was nice when I asked about the check, though.

It&#39;s tough to get a table here, so plan on standing if you&#39;re coming on a busy night. There were groups of people hovering all night waiting to score a seat. We got lucky."

My fiancé is a big craft beer guy and enjoys coming here. It&#39;s unfortunate that the service is almost always totally horrible. My last visit three weeks ago I thought I&#39;d never come back. Work friends and I went to a Tuesday trivia and I had to work a bit later so joined about half way through. When I arrived everyones drinks were empty and no sight of our waitress. Another hour passed of trivia and I couldn&#39;t believe they didn&#39;t want to sell us more drinks. I finally got up and asked a waitress that wasn&#39;t ours to put in a to go order since it was nearly 9 by then and we were almost finished with trivia. Another 30 minutes passes and our waitress finally comes back to give us the bill. I asked her about my to go order that I already paid for she said nothing, walked away, came back with the pizza and plopped it in front of me without a word. She then just walked away to her friends that she was clearly sitting with all night in a corner and hugged them and continued to socialize. We placed in trivia that night but all agreed we&#39;d probably never go there again. It&#39;s a shame since service can really sink a successful ship."

Be prepared to take the menu and do some reading.  They have a ton of bottle beers and ciders.  A ton.  Plus it&#39;s nicely organized by type and also by name.  You can do tastings of beer and ciders but it&#39;s limited to what they have in tap but that&#39;s still quite a large amount. 

Food wise, they have pizzas and a few other items.  I have had the Bavarian Pretzel and its huge with cheese and mustard dip.  The pretzel is a great compliment with beer tastings.

Let me put it this way, there are 26 pages of beer and 2 pages of the most simplistic food menu. In short, don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re expecting to have a decent meal. 

The menu: 4 appetizer choices, 1 bratwurst, 4 sandwich, 2 salad, 3 sweets and of course pizza (9 specialty and 1 build your own).

We ordered the Artichoke &amp; Goat Cheese Dip appetizer: artichoke hearts, goat and parmesan cheese, garlic with toasted crostini. 

You&#39;re not going to find another restaurant or bar that serves a pretzel the size of theirs. It&#39;s the size of a small, hand tossed thick pizza. 

Despite their selection of beer, I ordered a combination of my 2 favorites: Black and Blue (Guinness and Blue Moon). One of our friends ordered Root Beer which is root beer flavored beer...

They do have a large selection of beer but it wasn&#39;t cheap. We shared a large pretzel and it was good. I think the only unique thing about it was the size.

I&#39;ve been wanting to go since they opened but there was no strong motivating factor, especially after reading the reviews. It&#39;s disappointing because it&#39;s right across the street from my company - would make a great happy hour spot! Not to say I wouldn&#39;t go back but after my one and only time here, I&#39;m in no rush at all.

When my friend and I walked in, all eyes were on us! Why? Because a woman had walked in. Beer Market is about 85% men and that may be a low estimate. It was nearly completely packed at 5:15pm on a weeknight and my friend &amp; I were able to snag two of the last seats at the bar.

We sat....and sat....and sat. No one even said Hello to us for 15 minutes. I think it was like 30 minutes before we had a beer in front of us. Part of that was because they are out of about half the beers they list. What&#39;s the point in that? A lot of running around and back &amp; forth for the bartender pointlessly. They need a better system of keeping up to date with what they have in stock. The only reason my friend finally got the third beer he ordered was because he made sure he saw it in stock in the cooler. Also nearly every beer he ordered, our bartender had to ask who made it. I can&#39;t hate on that too much because there are a million and one craft beers on the market these days. But...she just didn&#39;t seem to be familiar with any of them. Not sure how she would have given any recommendations had we needed them.

One huge issue we witnessed was the gross understaffing at Beer Market. For a long while, I&#39;m talking two hours, there was one bartender for the whole seated bar. There were a couple of servers for the tables but the bar area itself had just one bartender. She was running around constantly and trying to take care of everyone so I also can&#39;t really blame her for taking 15 minutes to greet us and another 15 to get drinks in front of us. We saw glasses pile up at the end of the bar that the servers at the tables were dropping off. 

We decided to order a customized pizza and it seems being out of things extends to their food, as well. Their only food offerings done by them are pizzas or you can BYOF - bring in your own food or you can order from one of the places they have menus for, for delivery. I was excited to try one of their pizzas because an option was to have an egg on top! I&#39;ve never had an egg on pizza so was psyched. We ordered a pizza with mushrooms, sausage &amp; egg. A few minutes after we ordered, our server came to tell us that they were out of eggs. I don&#39;t even get how that&#39;s possible but I was very sad at that point. My sadness was melted away when our pizza came out because it was delicious. But c&#39;mon Beer Market! Have all your ingredients in stock!

Beer Market is so friggin loud and not in the good way. I think they must have bad acoustics and the music was turned up. At about 7 or 8, can&#39;t remember which, they turned the music even louder! My friend and I were shouting and quite turned off so we decided not to have another brew.

I&#39;m very sad because I think Beer Market has great potential but they need more staff, knowledgeable staff, they should have what they are offering in stock, and turn the music down. I&#39;m going to give them another try before completely discounting them, but I&#39;m not really on board at this point. I saw they have a beer club which could be interesting to sign up for, but no staff members mentioned it to us so I didn&#39;t get any details while there."

Then I waited another couple minutes for another girl to come, finally half shouted for a drink menu before she could disappear too so she hands me the menu and runs off before I can ask her a single question. I was going to ask what she recommended as its my first time here. Pissed me off enough to immediately whip my phone out to write this.

The word I got was corporate doesn&#39;t feel the kitchen is enough of a profit center to deserve more attention.  But it&#39;s ok, the place gets packed so the formula works for them.

Wish I remembered our servers name to give her a shout out. Later we had pizzas which were absolutely fabulous, and if for some reason you don&#39;t like the menu; you can always bring grub in from surrounding restaurants.

That said, even with a lot of stuff being out the selection is still wonderful for the location.

The one in Bolingbrook is huuuuuge and I&#39;ve had two really great experiences there that have left me wanting to make it my new hangout. I didn&#39;t have the same love affair with the Schaumburg location.

This one is A LOT smaller. I guess it wouldn&#39;t be too bad if you just came here off the street w/ no prior knowledge to the other location. Our group was able to grab a nice sized table in the center of the location. I went to the bar to order and the bartender was snooty. My friend went up and ordered behind me and said he was nice to her, so not sure why I got the attitude.

I ended up ordering one of the beers that was on the $3 bottle list (the beers they were trying to get rid of.) It was one of the Deschutes one. It was okay, but not really my style. 

Overall, it was a mediocre experience for what it was, but I really don&#39;t think I&#39;d find myself coming back here ever again. This is a really great place for craft beer enthusiasts because they have such a wide selection, but the environment felt lacking to me."

Mostly empty on a Tuesday night, I had a great time here with friends and was able to hold a conversation without straining.  The Beer Market definitely does not drown out the place with music.  We got comfortable at a large table and got our beer on.

The craft beer list is outstanding.  It&#39;s a Cheesecake Factory-sized menu, but it isn&#39;t overwhelming as only the first page (double sided) is their draft list.  The rest is bottles.  You will find something you like.  Also, free samples for the indecisive!

I ordered my favorite, the mixed draft of Framboise with Angry Orchard.  If possible, I&#39;d drink nothing but this the rest of my life.

This location is a LOT smaller than Bolingbrook, which surprises me considering the business they probably pull in on Friday and Saturday nights being right next to Woodfield Mall.  The Beer Market is convenient to the mall, many restaurants, and expressways.

Although the bartender was friendly, the waitress came to our table once and didn&#39;t acknowledge some of us, so some of us just ordered at the bar.  Although one member of our group told her, &#34;I just want to know how much I fcking owe,&#34; so maybe that scared her off.

The beer list is worth checking out, but due to the size of this place I would probably avoid it on the weekends."

We also ordered the HUGE pretzel and a pizza .... pretty darn tasty I will tell ya.  The cheese sauce for the pretzel was finger-licking-good and if I wasn&#39;t a lady, I would&#39;ve devoured that pizza on my own.

I&#39;m glad there is a bar in Schaumburg that isn&#39;t a restaurant, or a club. Nice change. However, compared to the other places I have gone that are carry vast amounts of beer, it&#39;s not the best.

They do have a great selection of both bottled and draft beers. As far as food goes, they have a really overpriced pretzel, some pizzas that looked pretty good and are decently priced, and you can order from other restaurants in the area (although I don&#39;t know which ones). You can try any of the beers for free, and they had some samples floating around on Friday night (nice!).  I ordered 2 different beers, and both were very good. 

This place is much bigger than it looks on the outside. You can sit at the bar, or at a small intimate table, or a larger table that you may share with other people. It does get crowed, so you want to come early.

I think what turned me off was the service. We came early and it wasn&#39;t very busy, and we were sitting right at the bar. Some of the bartenders were very nice, made conversation, and were attentive. Others were on their cell phones (not good practice), and obviously couldn&#39;t care less about doing their job. One bartender did ask if we had been there before and explained the menu. Like Phil S. said, you can expect to be ignored. 

Do I hate it? Absolutely not. But, if the service was kicked up a notch, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate giving it 5 stars."

Atmosphere
The Beer Market offers a nice mix of local Chicago Dive bar with a Suburb twist. 
My first visit was on a Friday and with no surprise, the place was packed with only one table available (as other reviews have said). On Friday and Saturdays there&#39;s a mix of live music and Karaoke for those who like to let their inner-Grammy nominee loose
It can get very loud in there so, not the ideal spot to go unwind and peacefully relax.


Food &amp; Drink  
I originally ordered the Breakfast Pizza which was at 9p on Friday during my first visit but switched to the BBQ Chicken pizza as the kitchen was out of ingredients for the Breakfast pizza. The pizza&#39;s are good size personal pizza that can feed one for sure maybe 2 adults depending on your appetite. I would recommend the BBQ chicken pizza to anyone who enjoys BBQ pizzas as it tasted fairly good (3.5 out of 5 stars) and was a good buy for the price. 

Navigating through the drink/beer menu (which is literally the whole menu) can be overwhelming . I highly suggest knowing what you like and asking for recommendations based off of that. Or! be completely spontaneous and try something random, there&#39;s literally a beer in there for everyone. I can recommend trying their &#34;Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer&#34; (5 out of 5 stars)  which as you would guess, is a root beer flavored beer. I want to say it had a 10% alcohol level which is fairly strong for a beer and tasted great - &#34;lightweights&#34; be warned!


Service
I&#39;d have to agree with the reviews I&#39;ve read and say that the service was okay, but could improve (as everything in life). The waitress that worked our table was hard to flag down not because of how busy it was but because she never looked in the direction of our table. However, when she was assisting us, she was very helpful when selecting a beer. 


All in all, if you&#39;re in the market for a bar in the suburbs with a nice small local feel to it, The Beer Market is a place you should try!"

My brother asked if anyone wanted to grab a drink and most of us said yes. From the outside, the place seemed small since it was part of a small shopping center. Once inside, I saw how spacious it looked. What surprised me next was the story behind this place because of its wide and I mean wide selection of beers. You would think a typical bar would carry certain selections of beers but this place, had beers I don&#39;t think I would ever come across in my life. Anyway, we sat down and were able to order some easy named beers, except me, I ordered something called Coney Island root beer, which was root beer with a little kick. My brother told us that this place has beer from other countries, including England and Germany. My drink was so good but I had a hard time drinking because of all the food I previously just had earlier that evening. I liked how they mad multiple TVs to watch different programs, including the March Madness and the Bulls. I give the place 4 stars but in all fairness, the waitress who seven us was almost not too helpful, probably because it was getting quite busy that evening. If you ask me, since they seem to have a huge selection of beers and such, they should make the place bigger. That would draw a lot more customers. I plan to come back sometime.

That`s why I can`t rate food but draft beer is always fresh and well poured. Our favorite and `must try` is CHOCOLATE COVERED ORANGE which is a fusion of chocolate and orange-wheat beer. It has a velvety smooth taste of chocolate followed by sweet and citrus character of wheat beer. What is most important they have most friendly stuff up there. On Saturdays they have live music but I wish they played some music on weekdays too. There is a lot of TV`s with games on it but music in the background would be a nice addition to it."

Service is now consistently slow and unfriendly. Taking a good 5-10 minutes to be greeted by a server, with an additional 5-10 to get drinks, is the norm...as is them being out of a lot of the beers on their menu. I mostly come by here now when I&#39;m craving their pizza...but they&#39;re a beer bar. Something&#39;s wrong with this picture... Step up your game, Beer Market!

The beer selection is great.   If you just want a regular beer or a mixed drink before trying a new beer stop at another bar first.  They miss the concept of cleaning your pallet so you can actually taste what your drinking.  The majority of the bar tenders are awesome, only one bad experience with a hipster bartender that was self absorbed with himself he forgot that if the customer isn&#39;t happy your tip will suck.   The pizza is surprisingly good for a bar like this.   

Great for a first date, conversations with friends, and the pizza is good.  3 visits and I will go back again."

Pros: Good beer list, prices are decent, and they serve food! There are also not a lot of other places like this in the Schaumburg area, so good for them.

Cons: Service was totally slow and inattentive. Also, the great beer selection doesn&#39;t mean much when three of the things we tried to order were not available. Finally, I didn&#39;t find the seating to be very comfy or cozy (but now I am just being nit-picky).

I might stop by again if I was in the area with nothing better to do, but then again, I probably won&#39;t."

Ryan also explained the concept that you could order food from Beer Market or any of the neighboring restaurants and they can deliver to you and best of all you can get food from home also. A good BYOF (Bring Your Own Food) concept !!

First thing... the parking situation sucks.  Strip malls suck in general, but when you tuck your bar in between a bunch of restaurants, forget it.  It was only 5PM and I barely managed to get a spot all the way down on the end.  It was fortunate that there were a ton of handicap parking spots right in front just in case someone with a disability shows up.

Once inside I immediately noticed the noise.  I don&#39;t understand the fascination with 15 foot high metal ceilings coupled with concrete floors.  This isn&#39;t the only place with this combination and I hate it every time I encounter it.

My impression of this place is that some corporation took the concept of a good craft beer bar and distilled it down to its components.  Then they reassembled them into this bar.  Unfortunately it is just not as good as the real thing.  The elements are there, but it doesn&#39;t feel right.

They have a lot of craft beers on tap so that is a good thing.  The menu is also filled with a ton of bottled beer, but I can get that at Binny&#39;s, so it doesn&#39;t really matter to me.

The walls are covered in beer related posters and advertising stuff.  It didn&#39;t feel like someone&#39;s collection.  It was just a dense wall to wall covering of &#34;beer stuff&#34; because someone decided that would give the place credibility.

The creepiest thing for me was the TV that was displaying what was supposed to look like a chalkboard.  Once again, trying to be like a cool bar, but with a corporate sterility.

There was a fair amount of seating, but I didn&#39;t like that some chairs had backs on them and others did not.  I require some back support if I am going to settle in to enjoy a few beers.

Overall I think this is a decent place.  It is certainly better than many bars that cater to the BMC and bomb crowds.  I would go back but I would not go out of my way to do so."

The Beer Market was hosting a Lagunitas event, if you ordered a Lagunitas you&#39;d get a custom mason jar glass and some pretty cool bottle cap magnets. We got there and it wasn&#39;t super busy, but decently full. We decided to sit near the back. Our waitress was super nice and decently attentive. Their beer selection was fantastic. We both got a Lagunitas since we wanted the glasses, but they have beer for everybody. We were also hungry, so tried the Margarita pizza and it was delicious. Perfect for splitting.

The beer listing is fantatic. A huge book of beers from all over. It is impossible to find not find something you want to try or like.

Now I have not had an issue with this place until last night. The service was slow. When it takes 10 minnutes + to get 4 drinks to a table not good.

This place also needs to get a touch tunes jukebox or something similar. The live bands they have had the past two Friday nights I&#39;ve been here have not been that great. If i want to hear 90&#39;s cover bands i&#39;d turn on YouTube. Combo that with the loud noise level it just hurts your ears.

So instead of having a good time with some mates watching the game on all the tv&#39;s they have, the live music and noise ruin that,

However if you want some good pizza and beer this is the palce to go in the Woodfield area."

It&#39;s first come first serve seat yourself so expect to be ignored by the staff for 15+ mins while you try to snag a seat.

The pizza, while not exactly to Chicago standards, is actually pretty good and works well with the beer. Then again, even Papa John&#39;s is good with some beer. It&#39;s made fresh here so the quality is decent.

Tip: get the spicy pizza and some IPA. Heaven.

Although it&#39;s a chain and prices are on the high side, it&#39;s nice to have a place where you can sample an astounding array of beers. Nice place to start the night off and listen to some live music while sipping on some high class."

Even though they don&#39;t have much food to choose from because it&#39;s a bring your own food establishment, their barbecue chicken pizza was amazing and the perfect snack to eat when drinking! 

The service was excellent each time I was here, and I found the servers to be very knowledgeable about the beer and which types I might like based on the information I gave them. They even let you sample first so you don&#39;t end up with an entire glass you don&#39;t like.

My husband and I stopped in on a Friday around 5 p.m. The after-work crowd was there and they were quite loud. It is one of those places where noise carries, so just be prepared for that.

After attempting to order 3 different beers and being told they were out of them, we just left and ended up at our local liquor store to grab our faves and enjoy them on our balcony. 

I know it can be hard to keep to up a beer list of that size, but going into a weekend crowd, it was surprising that they were out of so much.

Too bad this place isn&#39;t closer to home because I would definitely come back often--not just for the food, but for the extremely welcoming service.

We showed up for a late dinner around 9:15 PM on a Friday night.  We were greeted warmly &amp; seated quickly.

We looked over our menus and I decided to order the bi bim naeng myun and an order of their cod fish casserole.

The bi bim naeng myun was just ok, not as good as some of the other places that I&#39;ve fallen in love with in Honolulu and NorCal.

The cod fish casserole was very flavorful and definitely hits the spot for a cold, Chicago night.

I really liked the kimchee here.  Very flavorful and just the perfect amount of sour.

The food would be about 3.5-4 stars, but the service is deserving of 10 stars.  They are very accommodating and genuine.  Very great people!

We even got a free Klondike bar for dessert.  One for each of us.

When I asked for a glass of water, the owner came back with a cold bottled water at no charge.  This place is definitely worth visiting."

Thanks Yelp for the find! Overall, it&#39;s a unique, hole in the wall, casual restaurant crossed with oddball ambiance. 

Odd ambiance because the interior has eclectic (some home/handmade) decor, room for improvement in the ventilation area, and opportunity to dine with one Marilyn Monroe (as we did, since her portrait hung aside our booth).  

Come for the fresh flavors and food! Everything was flavorful and tasty. I&#39;m a huge fan of the chap chae, bibimbop, and bulgogi. The pre-meal tiny side dishes (the proper name for it escapes me) were ordinary, so don&#39;t fill up. 

I can also vouch for the free ice cream served after the meal (mini drumsticks and Klondike bars) and gifting of a random stuffed toy to the table. On this occasion, the recipient was my mom since it was her bday."

The owner has apparently had the business for 10 years and is an arts and crafts type person.  You can tell from the eclectic artsy collections that decorate the place, some of which he crafted himself.  They have classical music playing in the background here also.  The food though is definitely Korean and still the main draw as it should be, and it was very good, satisfying, and flavorful.  Our server was also very polite, efficient, and friendly as well.  Our party of four enjoyed:

- banchan
- chap chae
- so myun (a soup with thin noodles)
- dak bokum (pan fried spicy chicken)
- bi bim bop
- kal bi - marinated grilled beef short ribs

We finished with complimentary klondike ice cream bars and Lil&#39; Drum drumsticks.

Grilled meat dishes can be cooked by the kitchen (as we preferred) or at the table grill as the customer prefers.  All of the hot dishes were piping hot, fresh, and delicious.  The space is smallish and divided into an area with maybe eight  4-person and private partitioned booths and an area with a single large dining table for groups.

1. Very good quality Bulgogi and Kalbi, nicely marinated, cut and prepared for tableside grilling, with oversized mushrooms, onions, green onions and a little zucchini; portions are reasonable and along with the rice, soup and side dishes sufficient.
2. Soup was a simple Miso type and decent but not as good as some places.
3. 6-8 side dishes were very fresh and tasty though less in number than most places; Kimchee was especially good.
4. Cooking is done on a metal pan over flame; I prefer cooking over charcoal or wood, but the meat was very flavorful and did not disappoint.
5. Korean Barley Tea, our favorite available at no charge.

We were seated promptly after arriving and were even able to enjoy the interesting artwork at our table while we waited. 

The food was superb and authentic! I enjoyed the Hot Pot Bi Bim Bap and it was marvelous! The small plates (banchan) they bring you ahead of time were also great (especially the kimchi if you enjoy spicy dishes). 

The service was excellent as well! Our waiter was quick with refilling our water when we over committed to our spicy dishes (no regrets) and was very kind!

I went to around 6-7 Korean BBQ restaurants here in Chicago area already. This Korean BBQ restaurant is the best of the best!!! Beef is SUPER YUMMY - very tender &amp; well marinated. It comes with many kinds of delicious vegetable appetizers, rice, soup, and even dessert. But moreover, the waiters&#39; services are always great!!! They are very nice, kind, and too humble :-) My heart and stomach are always satisfied. Today was my second visit. They even gave us some lovely stuffed toys after meal :-) (It seems some kind of campaign right now, other customers also got them.) I strongly will recommend this restaurant.

It&#39;s like a large room made up of secret booths that could use a paint job with artistic statues and it&#39;s absolutely phenomenal. I love it. 

I&#39;m vegetarian and they had about three true veggie options but a lot of the dishes you can ask for no meat and they happily help out. One of the options include a veggie BBq dish. 

Was given a bowl of cashews for an appetizer for free. My favorite nut of all time! 

I had the tofu appetizer and bi bim bop (sans beef) and it was great! Took the appetizer tasted like it had sesame oil and garlic on it which was delicious.

I loved grilling my own veggies on the grill in The middle of our table. We also got free Klondike bars for dessert.

Drinks are cheap. Smaller selection but totally adequate. A glass of wine was $4.50 and a large 650 ML beer was $6.50. Get the OB beer, it&#39;s very smooth with a hint of German hops so it kind of reminded me of a Hefeweizen Pilsner mix. 

I&#39;ve never met nicer people in my entire life. I will be sure to come back here again. Even though I live in the city, I will drive out here to go to this place."

This place was an experience, because of the customer service. We LOVED our servers. Sweet, generous, helpful, just - amazing. I didn&#39;t know you could impact people as much as they did, as a server at a restaurant! I cannot wait to go back. This place deserves every one of five stars."

A friend said that I had to try Bi Bim Bop.  Ok, I like saying it so it must taste good. 

We tried this local place based on good reviews from other Yelpers and we were not disappointed. 

Our waiter was so helpful.  We told him it was our first time having Bi Bim Bop.   He explained all the ingredients.  He explained the best way to eat it.  He brought 6 side dishes to accompany the Bi Bim Bop.  Not to put in it but to have before and during the main meal.   A nice clear beef broth with fresh green onions on top was included as well as barley tea.

I liked how hot the Bi Bim Bop stayed in the heated stone bowl.   The chili sauce that I put on the Bi Bim Bop (still love saying it) was delicious - a bit hot and a tiny bit sweet.

The waiter provided attentive service without overdoing it.  And the manager treated us to ice cream for dessert.  Now that is a sweet deal.  

The quality and quantity of food was very fair. 

The ambience and decor are a bit funky/eclectic but we just rolled with it and enjoyed a whole new experience and cuisine."

First of all, they&#39;re open until 10pm on Sundays.  Not many places are and we really only have Sunday nights free.

Next, they go out of their way to accommodate their customers.  We showed up around 8pm with no reservation, not realizing that it was going to be full on a Sunday night.  After agreeing to a 25 minute wait (not bad), we were told a few minutes later that the wait would be longer, and we were asked if it would be OK if we were seated in the party room.  We agreed and were seated immediately.

The menu is gigantic.  We were overwhelmed with choices that&#39;s a very good thing!  We ended up ordering the Korean Special for 2.  It ended up being enough food for 4 people and a tremendous value.  Additionally, literally everything was delicious!  It came with 6 appetizers, a huge bowl of soup, and a massive pile of meat and seafood.  We ended up taking half of it home.

The service was fantastic too.  Our server was really friendly and checked in on us frequently.  He even showed us how Korean people eat their BBQ with lettuce leaves and rice and sauce, which we were not aware of.  We got dinner AND some cultural education!  The manager and head chef even checked on us a couple times.  They were all cool and friendly.

The drink menu is huge too, and I had Korean shoju for the first time.  It wasn&#39;t much different than the Japanese shochu I like to drink, and it paired extremely well with the food.

I cannot say enough good things about this place and I would recommend it to anyone."

I&#39;m a huge fan of Korean food but just realized all of the Korean bbq places I&#39;ve been to (even living right next to Korea town in Dallas) paled in comparison to Chungkiwa.  First, the decor.  Yes, it is very odd and eclectic.  The booth we sat at had a naked female statue, a moose coat hanger and a picture of a baby scratching it&#39;s ass.  Across from us was a bronze statue of a man decapitating another man with what appeared to be an axe.  Oh yeah, he was also naked.  Okay, but I&#39;m not here to eat the decoration.  Stuff like that really doesn&#39;t hinder a good dining experience.  But, the service which does play a role in how I truly feel about a restaurant was EXQUISITE! From the moment we walked in, my date and I were greeted by the most genuine, humble and attentive waiter and owner.  So please tip well if you receive the same exceptional attention during your eating experience.

We ordered korean dumplings, bulgogi, pork belly and split a bottle of soju for about  75 bucks.  It was a lot more expensive compared to the other places that yelp pulled up but so worth the money! The beef bulgogi wasn&#39;t stained dark brown like I&#39;ve seen so many times, but bright red and looked actually like beef, surrounded by a light marinade.  The result was that it was easily the best bulgogi I&#39;ve ever had.  Apparently we ordered a pound, but it felt less because it was so delicate, light and tender.  I also appreciated that the meat plates came out with raw vegetables so you could throw them on the hot grill.  The pork belly was as delicious as it sounds, simple, no seasoning but turning into something magical once you cook it and then dip it in the sesame oil and salt and pepper mixture.  All of the banchans and rice were perfect.  Most of the banchans were recently made.  This place is the true definition of quality is way better than quantity! I&#39;m kinda craving it again tonight...

Cool note: Most of the tables are private booths, which we loved because it made it feel like we were at our own private restaurant.  Great ventilation here too.  Just saying.  I hate smelling like smoke for the rest of the day."

The decor is eccentric, but makes you want to seek out the sculptures :)  Wish the bench was more comfortable too.

What we had:
Beef Soup - nice portion, good taste
Pork Belly - perfectly soft and greatly seasoned
Galbi - perfect cuts and superbly seasoned
Ribs - marbly goodness
Bi Bim Bop - total balance and distinct flavors, great rice
Japchae - not kidding, the best Japchae I&#39;ve ever had, noodles perfectly cooked, not greasy and a incredible depth of flavor that I&#39;ve never experienced.  Going back to see if it was a fluke.
Cones - complimentary cones after dinner, nice surprise

I want to emphasize that the service was amazing and attentive.  So many times (and my Korean friends are frank and will readily agree) if you&#39;re not Korean you just don&#39;t get the personal and warm service that Korean diners clearly get.  It borders on the ridiculous.  Not here.  I&#39;m seriously amazed.  Definitely doing something right.  Good value, pricing is as it should be."

Additionally, the wait staff was attentive and passionate. We received free additional side dishes/rice, and even ice cream after our meal.

I try to eat Korean food in every city we visit, and we travel quite a bit.
I read the reviews while in Chicago at a conference, and decided to try this place. The reputation was of a pricey place with great service.
We found them in a small shopping center tucked away in a small space.
The food was fantastic! Like you&#39;re at a local place in Seoul. The owner and waitstaff were very attentive and showed pride in their food.
Pricing. Well the pulgogi, the best known Korean dish, was pricey, but just plain delicious !  The other dishes were often half that price, and were a very good selection of Korean dishes.
You should try this restaurant. If you&#39;re new to Korean food, they&#39;ll cook your food at your table right in front of you if you&#39;d like that.  The booths and tables were nicely private. I wouldn&#39;t call it fancy. I want comfortable and great food. I don&#39;t seek fancy places. They do a great job. Two of us ate for $50. Down right Cheap for a short trip to South Korea."

After going to dozens of KBBQ places from Koreana, BBQ Hut, Seocho Garden, 92 Town, Chicago Kalbi, etc... This place jumps to the first of my list for best KBBQ that I&#39;ve had in Illinois.  This place is located in a strip mall and upon entering it you will see a bunch of artsy decor.  The restaurant isn&#39;t very huge, but can seat two big parties (8+) on one side and a few smaller groups (4-6) on the other.

The owner and waiters took our order and the food came out quick.  The first thing to come out was the Hot Stone BiBimBop and that was good. It was on par with other Korean Restaurants is your typical bibimbop.  The next item to come out was the Panjeon (Seafood Pancake), oh man this pancake easily jumps to the best Panjeon I ever had. It even topped some of the pancakes that I&#39;ve had in Seoul, Korea.  The batter they use is different, which gives it crispy, fluffy texture in every bite.  My only regret with this is that we didn&#39;t buy two of these!

Now on to the main course! We ordered a assortment of things to grill Samgyeopsal , Kalbi, Beef Tongue, Bulgogi, and Squid.  Although my preference is charcoal when grilling meat, many restaurants, including this one uses gas instead.  Meat isn&#39;t just meat here, they use some quality cuts of meat here that are tender and packed with flavor.  I was impressed with the bulgogi especially, usually I do not like to order this because places either cut the bulgogi too small so when you grill it, the meat shrivels up or the marinades are not good.  The Bulgogi here are biggest slices and the marinade goes very well with the meat.  The Samgyeopsal included onions, zucchini, and a few mushrooms to grill with it.  I thought that the amount of meat you get on each order was a good amount.  

The service here is very good, the waiters/owners are very nice and attentive. They asked multiple times throughout the meal if we needed anything, and of course we needed more banchan :) At the end of the meal, mini ice cream drumsticks were brought out and some toy plushies were brought out for the girls.  This extra service was very generous of them and the atmosphere of this place is very welcoming.  Overall, this place jumps to the top of my list for best KBBQ in Illinois. Maybe the next time I come back, I&#39;ll include pictures, we ate all the food too quick to snap some."

Upon entering, the setting wasn&#39;t very welcoming as we were the only patrons in the restaurant, no music playing, and there were many sculptures and other art pieces that seemed &#39;out of place.&#39;  It certainly gave us a lot to talk about and look at.  I was 1 of 2 Korean-speaking people in our group and our waiter was beyond conversational throughout the experience.  It was clear that he took pride in the restaurant, from the food to the artwork.  He gave us great recommendations (ie. scallion pancakes are very crispy, the meat is super fresh, all food is prepared to order) and he was right - we were all very pleased with the food.  He checked in on us very frequently and even proceeded to showcase some other historical artwork and a collector&#39;s item sword.  But that&#39;s not all, we each received a different STUFFED ANIMAL at the end of it all as a parting gift.  And MINI DRUMSTICK ice cream cones for dessert.

As many have said, the service was above average and the food was great.  Our group could not stop talking about it even after we left."

On one hand, the flavors are pretty spot on , everything seems to be made out of good ingredients, the dishes are presented well -- however the portions are a bit small, lacking in meat, and the prices are quite high. The dishes are also not very memorable in flavor -- satisfying but you wouldn&#39;t recognize them in a blind taste test against other local Korean restaurants. The service is relatively good, the food temperature and cooking speed is good, the dining areas are comfortable and decorated quite a bit (although I don&#39;t exactly understand the theme), the noise level isn&#39;t too high although the background music isn&#39;t Korean themed.

I was served 6 banchan here, all fresh and light tasting -- a little small on portion size although we were offered refills -- nothing unusual you haven&#39;t tried elsewhere.

The hot pot bibimbap had a light flavor to it with nicely crisped rice. The fried end was prominent in this dish but I wish that the sliced beef was more noticable. The lightly sauteed and seasoned vegetables did provide nice texture contrast in the dish.

Jang gook bop had a good body to the broth with just the right amount of rice in the soup. 

Kalbi tang casserole was mixed for me -- I wish the beef had more flavor and the sesame oil was a little strong but the vermicelli in the dish did add a nice touch.

Sam kyup sal - The slices of pork belly were prepared well, fatty but still having a bouncy texture to the meat and crispy edges. The taste of sesame was prominent in this dish but it worked well. Still, a bit expensive for the amount of meat you&#39;re getting.

The meal ended with Lil&#39;Drums, which appropriately matches the mixed East-West feel I got from this restaurant. 

Overall, it&#39;s a place I would return to for the quality of the food -- but still wish that the prices would be just a little lower."

First, the service is probably the best I&#39;ve had in a long, long time at a Korean restaurant (or any restaurant, really). The owner and (his son?) are authentic and you can tell they really care about you. It isn&#39;t just some show. At the end of our delicious meal, the owner gave my fiance a rose to give to me (it was Valentine&#39;s Day) and the gave us each an ice cream cone (free, on the house)! Talk about quality service. 
Not to mention the food was spectacular. And the banchan refills were unlimited and free, just like it should be. Thank you to Chungkiwa for keeping it real! I hope your restaurant continues to live long and prosper.
Oh and we ended up eating here by chance, because the other place we wanted to go was closed on Sundays. Such a wonderful happy accident. :)"

What I do know is that every culture has something amazing to offer so I decided to go for it when my friends suggested this joint.

From the looks of it doesn&#39;t seem like it has any potential. I live so close to it and never realized it was there. Its in that weird plazza on algonquin by busse. Who would ever think that this fantastic korean place is there. Well I am so glad I ran into this place.

A fun fact about this place. You can cook the food yourself in front of you or you can order it be cooked in the back. I sugested we have it cooked in the back. I am not the best cook and frankly I am not sure how much I am bound to eff it up. 

My friend ordered 4 orders of bulgogi, 2 with the bone and 2 without. One loves the bone one and my other friend opts for the other. I think they taste exactly the same but hey what do I know? I am from south east europe, all we know is tomatoes and feta cheese. They were fantastic. It was blesses with some great seasoning and a fun like teriyaki sauce. Lohoved it! 

They give you so many little dishes with the food. They are more like sides or sauces. Some of them are really good, some are just too spicey for me. (I genuinely feel bad for the dishwasher) 

Now the best part of this place. The service!!! Our server was attentive, humble, sweet and efficient. I was really impressed. I loved everything about this place. Cant wait to fo there again."

We decided on Korean BBQ and I looked to Yelp in search of something good.  I decided on this restaurant due to good reviews for friendly service.  We got there and explained to waitress it was our first time and needed help ordering.  She pretty much said... It&#39;s all good and didn&#39;t help at all.  We didn&#39;t know how much to order.  Korean. BBQ meat dishes were 25 to 30 dollars each so weren&#39;t sure of portion size and what was included but again we didn&#39;t receive any help.  After ordering a few things she said, kitchen closes at 2 but I&#39;ll let you know.  Ten minutes later one plate of meat was dropped at table and guy walked away. The grill was not set up so we didn&#39;t know what to do and no one came to help.  Finally we asked someone for help and they looked at us like we were a huge burden.  A guy came back and uncovered grill and opened vent but still offered no assistance.  We asked again for help and a guy came and started grilling for us.  Meat was really good but portion seemed small for price, only came with white rice .  The guy picked up a large piece on short rib plate and said it was all bone and he should throw it away.  Why would they plate that?  We were all still hungry and asked to order more and he told us the kitchen was closed.  We pointed out it wasn&#39;t even 2 yet and he acted like he didn&#39;t understand.  We asked waitress again and she said sorry kitchen closed.  Ten minutes later she told us restaurant was now closed, please leave.  I would love to try Korean BBQ again, but not here."

The portion is decent and just enough to fill your stomach (not enough if you are used to AYCE BBQ though). The side dishes are adequate but nothing spectacular. The fried dumpling we ordered for the appetizer is really delicious and not the usual all-crispy you would typically find in Korean restaurants. I would recommend it. However, the service is awesome.

You also MUST try their seafood pancake. Don&#39;t ask me why but just try it. It is so different from anywhere else, in an extremely good way!

I have been to many Korean restaurants all over Chicago, suburbs, even all over Hawaii, and I would have to say that this will be one of my favorite top 3. I only say &#39;top 3&#39; not only because of the amazing food, but because of the atmosphere. Every table has its own unique artistry within an enclosed booth. Which is also why it would be a perfect &#39;date&#39; place. The owner is the only chef and he uses only the highest quality meats and vegetables. The seasoning on the food uses no msg, and it isn&#39;t overly salty like other Korean restaurants. The chef truly IS a chef! We came here because we couldn&#39;t find the original place we were planning on going to. This is one of those &#39;good&#39; mistakes. I am REALLY impressed! Upon Arriving we received little gifts and the Chef/owner handed them to us greeting &#34;Happy New Year!&#34; He seems like a very humble and peaceful man.

They had a good variety of banchan dishes as well. 

Whatever they lacked in food quality, they definitely made up for in service! The specials only came with two wonton soups each but they gave us extras so everyone can have one. Then after we ate, our waiter brought each of us complimentary sundae cones. Our waiter was so attentive to our needs and he was super helpful and kind. There was no automatic gratuity charge but we made sure to give him a good tip. 

We must make a note about the decor as well--very unique setup and interesting art pieces around the whole restaurant--makes for a great ambiance.

The owner and waiters always treat us like family -- sometimes giving us appetizers on the house if we order a lot of entrees! 

As for the food, everything is cooked by one chef who also creates the stone carving artwork displayed throughout the restaurant. We always order the chapchae, seafood pancake, kalbi or bulgolgi, hot pot bibimbap, and tofu casserole. And there&#39;s free ice cream for dessert!

The tofu casserole was flavorful, but it seemed to be of a smaller portion than usual. At least, the soup level was an inch below the rim of the bowl (see photo) and it initially came without egg. I generally expect my tofu soup to be bubbling violently over the sides :). Also, they used firm tofu which didn&#39;t seem to match the dish as well as the usual soft stuff.

Loved the banchan, though! Included a spicy tofu dish. Our server was insanely attentive, offering to replace banchan and such. We also received a free dessert of mini cheesecakes, which were a bit frozen but still appreciated."

So color me happy when this little place shows up on Yelp,  and it was still open to boot. Win! 

When you walk in the decor might temporarily confuse you.  Somebody mentioned it feels a little &#39;Greek&#39; and I&#39;ll agree that is a pretty accurate observation.  The thing is once you breathe in you will know that there is no souvlaki here but glorious, delicious Korean fare awaits.  

Hub had bulghogi because that is always a good staple when trying a new place, and I had assorted veg which they prepared vs grilling my own. 

The banchan were pretty good, not the best kimchee I have ever had (it was very mild) but all were restocked religiously by our uber friendly waiter. 

The people here are super, by the way! A far cry from the usual ancient Korean lady whom is angry at the whole world. LOVED the service.  

The bulghogi smelled amazing, it was tender, juicy and well marinated. It caramelized beautifully when grilled and made the H a happy man. 

Hungry woman finished her plate o&#39;veggies with a stupid smile on her face, and was happily surprised by the cute (albeit par frozen) baby cheesecakes. They were actually quite good, the frozenness made them into little cheesecakepopsicle bites. 

All in all a solid choice for dinner (or lunch I&#39;d presume), and not just because it is one of the few places open late. Yup- we&#39;ll be back."

There are many Korean/BBQ restaurants in the northwest suburbs.  Tonight we decided to try one we never had before.  We drove by Chungkiwa many times but for some reason this was our first visit; and we like it!  First impression - with artworks and classical music all over the restaurant it was so non-traditional.  Service was very attentive, prompt, and friendly.  Quality of food was excellent - tasty, not salty, not overpowered by garlic as many BBQ restaurants do.  Everything was just right.  They had the best kimchi and bibimbop.  Highly recommended; and we definitely will return to Chungkiwa.  PS - I do agree with Tony C&#39;s wife comments on the price....."

The restaurant is located in a strip mall and to put it plainly, it&#39;s a hole in the wall. Inside the decor matches the outside. The lack of ambience is more than made up by the really nice employees at the restaurant. Everyone is super sweet and friendly. This is a family run place so don&#39;t expect white table cloths or a large wine list. 
We ordered the Chungkiwa special for 2. This included soup, appetizers , and and an assortment of marinated meats to grill. The best part of Korean BBQ is the ability to grill your own meat which was perfect for since we don&#39;t agree on how long to grill meats. The appetizers were delicious and the soup was amazing! The meats were fresh and tender. 
The only reason this place didn&#39;t get 5 stars is because the decor leaves a lot to be desired. But if your looking for a small whole in the wall authentic Korean BBQ restaurant near Ohare then come here immediately!"

We came on a double date a few weeks back at the recommendation of the other couple, she is part Korean and this is where her Korean family eats.

1. Service, unlike other Korean BBQ houses, was STELLAR.  100% above par.  Very attentive, gracious (free dessert anyone?) honest, and polite.

2. Food was out of this world.  We started with an appetizer noodle dish, the name of which I&#39;ve regrettably forgotten.  It was glass-type noodles stir fried with vegetables and meat.  We also ordered an order of chicken and an order of bulgogi to cook on the grill.  The meat came with assorted vegetables as well.

3. Side dishes were also great, and replenished as many times as we wanted.  We had ample amounts of kimchi, chili tofu, bean sprouts, sweet radish, fish cake, and lightly pickled cucumbers.

The 2 main dishes and appetizer plus sides were more than enough for four of us.  Throw in drinks, and the bill including tip came to $45 per couple.  Not bad at all!

I will definitely be back to try other meats, and let Chungkiwa wow me some more!"

However, I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the most traditional kind of cooking. I like the food here because the cooking is clean, and less greasy than other places. Also, ventilation is good here with the bbq grilling because my clothes didn&#39;t smell that much after I left. 

I would highly recommend the seafood pancake (if you like yours on the crispier side). I enjoyed the pork and kimchi stir fry as well. Also, you can&#39;t go wrong with the bbq, and this comes with bean paste soup. 

Furthermore, the workers here are very friendly and attentive to customers&#39; needs. They are a little quirky, though- not in a bad or annoying way. For instance, I came here on Christmas, and they passed out stuffed animals to everyone as a gift. 

Anyway, this review is coming from a Korean, so it&#39;s worth trying out :)"

These have been broiled, char broiled, roasted, or smoked to create delicious flavors.

El Rey Del Pollo Asado specializes in this type of preparation and offers meals at a fairly decent price (comparable to KFC or Popeyes). The chicken is fairly priced although the 1 or 1.5 chicken portions are not as big as you&#39;d expect as each chicken piece is cut up into smaller portions. The meat itself was a bit overcooked (not quite tough, but not tender) and could&#39;ve  used more spices and marination. The skin that others talked about was somewhat between slightly crispy and chewy -- fairly good if you consider this a fast food restaurant but nowhere near the best I&#39;ve had, even among other fast or fast casual restaurants that specialize in chicken.

As Patty said, there&#39;s really nothing to say about the sides. They seem like an afterthought with preparations, textures, and flavors that don&#39;t stand out -- and in fact, are probably a detriment to the entire dining experience when you remember how mediocre they are. The salsas were alright, not the most complex flavors I&#39;ve ever had but gives the chicken some variety in flavor. I wish they were presented in a bit more attractive of a manner and prepared in smaller portions -- but given the price of the food, I can understand why it&#39;s presented in the way it is.

Overall, good if you&#39;d like to try something a little different at a reasonable price. But doesn&#39;t really stand out as a superb version of pollo asado."

I spent about 20 years in south Florida and missed something like a pollo tropical. This is really solid. The chicken was delicious! The chicken torta was good too. 

I disagree with others in regards to the sides. I found the rice and beans to be quite authentic and tasty. The grilled onions blew my mind. Really enjoyed that.

They had many of their items to taste.
I have to say the food was outstanding and the choices were many.

I particularly liked the carne asana tacos and  the pollo tacos.  The grilled onions were very sweet and tender.

After that, I took a Family Order back home for dinner.  It included a whole cut up chicken and three sides ( I took the beans, macaroni and cheese and the grilled onions).  All the food had a great flavor by themselves and when dipped in the different salsas increased the intensity without being just hot. I didn&#39;t pay attention to the menu because it came with the grilled onions and grilled jalapeños so I didn&#39;t need to order a side of grilled onions.

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the Carne Asada dinner and some of the different tortas. 

They have just pick up some new customers and some of my friends that I already told about the new place in town.

I stopped by very quickly before starting my shift. I walked in but didn&#39;t get to really focus much on the look of the restaurant. I walked right up to the counter and placed my order. I had looked at the reviews from their other location and I was convinced that I had to try the chicken. I ordered the two piece chicken special with rice and beans and it came with a drink. 
My order was taken and packaged very quickly. 
I have to say the restaurant smelled delicious and the same smell followed me to my car. I couldn&#39;t wait to get to work and eat my food. 
I open my white styrofoam box to find 2 delicious looking pieces of chicken, a leg and thigh, a nice portion of rice and a separate container of beans. Not refried beans but whole beans in a spicy soupy like broth. The chicken was served with cebollitas asadas and tortillas. It was absolutely a fabulous meal. The chicken was cooked to perfection, not dry but juicy and full of flavor. The beans were so good I wished I had a bigger portion of them. The rice was just ok but the chicken was delicious!!! 
With this being down the street from my work, I can see myself being a regular here. Not only for eating while on lunch or to bring home to my family for dinner.

Some stoner with his little girl was in line in front of me. He ordered macaroni and cheese.... At a chicken restaurant. So that was interesting. The girl behind the counter was very nice and took my order, but while I was waiting for my meal I noticed no one was wearing gloves. The cook in the back had a literal handful of food, I don&#39;t know what it was, but he didn&#39;t seem to care. The other girl putting my sides in their containers had no gloves either. Someone was putting up Halloween decorations with a hammer. There was a salsa bar but no labels as it what it was and seemed sketchy to me. I&#39;m already regretting my decision. I try a few bites of the chicken, and although it seemed moist and well seasoned, I was so disgusted by the handing of my food I couldn&#39;t eat it. Mac and cheese was also pretty gross (more like fake pasta with some weird liquid cheese) and I feel really bad for that little girl that&#39;s what she had for dinner.

The prices are reasonable but this place has never met a freezer they didn&#39;t like. I ordered the chicken strips dinner and it just tasted so... dry. Dry and rubbery. This wasn&#39;t chicken; it was some fake chicken meat hybrid. Well the seasoned fries have to be good right? Nope. Dry as an Arizona desert. At least the beverage tasted like liquid.

I think if I want late night food, Steak And Shake will be a better option. The food is a bit fresher and actually has taste.

Edit: As of 12-22-2015 I tried this place one more time. Not only did they screw up my order (how do you confuse a medium steak with well done?) but no one has checked on me in over ten minutes. So now the service is just as bad, if not worse than the food!

I was not really happy with my food, the potatoes in the scrambler were cooked too long and were hard and dry.  But to be honest it was not what I really wanted anyway, I took too long to decide and just settled on anything.  My husband had a Philly cheese steak omelette that did not look like the photo on the menu but he liked it and would get it again.  My father in law and son got a bourbon chicken dish with veggies and it was absolutely delicious.  I am going back just to get the dish they ordered but to go, highly recommend it. 

It was very crowded, of course, it was a Sunday and the restaurant is very small.  I do not like how the tables are laid out, the way the seating is we pretty much shared a table with a large family and of course, the family had babies that were crying loudly.  

It&#39;s Denny&#39;s, you know what to expect, but I feel the prices are reasonable, the food did not take too long to come out, and the waitresses are nice, not overly nice which can seem fake but they were nice."

I saw the commercials for the Bacon Extravaganza going on and my friends wanted breakfast food, so Denny&#39;s it was! This is actually a very nice Denny&#39;s location, super clean and super friendly servers who seem eager to please. And honestly, Denny&#39;s prices just can&#39;t be beat. They have tons of items for just $2 or $4 which I would do normally but NO! I had a purpose today. Happy Baconalia! 

Ever since seeing the commercial I have wanted to try the Bacon Sundae so that would surely be my dessert. For my main entree, the Triple Bacon Sampler: 2 hickory-smoked bacon strips, 2 pepper bacon strips and 2 strips of turkey bacon plus 2 eggs and cheesey hashbrowns. The bacon was whatever except the Pepper Bacon was a standout, definitely would get that again. I got my eggs cooked sunnyside up and they were cooked perfectly. The cheesey hashbrowns had bits of bacon in them and were just delicious! I wouldn&#39;t get the bacon sampler again as it was more $$$ for more bacon and not worth it...all I need it that Pepper Bacon! Delish! 

And then the moment came. Bacon Sundae time. My friends were disgusted as I dived into the cool swine decadence. The vanilla ice cream is topped with bacon pieces and some maple syrup nomnomnomz. As I kept eating I could see the crown jewel at the bottom, a big pile of bacon and maple syrup (see picture).  This sundae was amazing but towards the end of it, I was feeling a bit bacon overloaded. It was too maple syrupy at the end and just seemed like a melty maple syrup mess!

All in all, great Denny&#39;s location, tasty HIGH caloric food, cheap prices, great service!"

Anyway, it was a typical Denny&#39;s visit. Reasonable prices, good value, and basically exactly what you&#39;d expect from Denny&#39;s food.

My breakfast was satisfactory. The skillet was rated a 7.5/10 mutually. The pancakes are delicious and the mini banana split was a good time.

I&#39;ll be the first to say I&#39;m no expert on this style of food so I can&#39;t really comment on whether or not it is authentic or how it compares to other Middle Eastern places.

What I CAN say is that I find their falafel wraps to be absolutely delicious. It runs you about $7.00 which is a little pricy for just a sandwich but every time I get it it is cooked to perfection and the wrap is quite literally busting from the seams with food. I get a mix of the hot and the garlic sauce and it never disappoints. I could eat here every day...I can&#39;t go a work week without going here at least once.

The Greek Fries are also amazing...this place is a gem!!"

Time of my visit: Lunch hour

This was my first time here.  The place came up on my Yelp! search as being close to my work.  It relatively was.

It was a bit hard to find, once I pulled into the structure and the whole setup (not the place itself) felt a bit claustrophobic.  Just in case you are coming over there for the first time, it&#39;s facing Lake, 2 doors down from Starbucks.

On to the food.  I ordered chicken shawarma, well, because I always do when I am trying a new Mediterranean place.  I also added drink and fries to it and a chicken skewer (they did not have a beef one).  It was served relatively quick and was brought out to me as it came out of the kitchen.

I&#39;ll start in the order I ate it.  The fries were unbelievably delicious!  I was not sure what they fried it in, but oh man, they were good!  I chose garlic sauce with it in the pita.  The first bite was delicious.  The next one was very interesting... I felt something hard and crunchy (don&#39;t believe it was anything but food, i.e. pita or chicken), so I am not sure if a piece of chicken was burned or a piece of pita was burned.  I decided to try a piece of chicken skewer and it was soft, moist, juice and very delicious and so was the chicken in the rest of the shawarma.  I am gonna dismiss it as a freak accident.  The biggest thing for me was the portion to price ratio... It seemed the amount of chicken in shawarma was not nearly as much as it should have been.  As I had gotten to the end of the sandwich, it was filled with vegetables and no chicken.  The skewer was pretty good, nicely grilled with veggies.

As to the price, the shawarma by itself was $7, fries and a drink is another $2.25-$2.50 and based on my math skewer was about $2-$2.50.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s a bit pricey, even for that area.

Overall a B+!  Definitely could be an A some day.  Worth a try!"

Came here last night for the first time. My wife and I both got the Shawarma bowls; she got the chicken, I got two meats, chicken and steak. I got two sauces, garlic and hot. I thought the dish was quite tasty. The meat was very tender and flavorful and it was over a bed if perfectly cooked Mediterranean rice.  One half of the bowl was meat and rice, the other half was salad which was also tasty because it had the Mediterranean veggie mix, cucumbers and tomatoes. My garlic and hot sauce were perfectly drizzled on top. Blended together, it all tasted phenomenal and was very filling.

My wife and I split a 6pc falafel side. The falafel was good too; moist inside, not dry like some other Mediterranean places I&#39;ve been to. My only gripe was that they didn&#39;t give us any Taziki sauce to go with our falafel so I had to dip them in the sauce I had leftover from my dish. Service was average. The guys inside were nice and it didn&#39;t take long to make our meal. I would definitely come back next time I got a taste for Mediterranean."

I ordered a chicken kabob wrap with the garlic sauce (you get to choose between three sauces). One negative is that it took about 20 minutes for my order, which seemed kinda long for just a wrap, but be aware they seem to do a lot of carry-out/delivery orders, so it seems they can get backed up that way. The wrap was delicious and quite large, full of fresh veggies and tasty grilled chicken. Next time I&#39;d get the sauce on the side to dip, though. It was a pretty messy wrap and quite drippy (think 7-8 napkins to eat it). Will definitely be back to try new things. A-OK."

The pitas: dry and thin.
The falafel: bland
The steak: tough
The kefta: actually pretty good here
The hummus: also not bad

Overall, the meal just no good. I probably would have been happier if I could drown it all away with some sauce. Unfortunately, the meal only came with two tiny containers (which I think were actually for my girlfriend&#39;s wrap) and a drizzle on top of the meat.

Middleterranean is quickly becoming on of my favorite places in the area. They have all the classic Mediterranean food staples, from falafels and grape leaves, to hummus and baba ganoush, they even have off-the-spit chicken shawarma!

Middleterranean has a very laid back Mediterranean vibe, without the greasy food one might expect from a fast food establishment. The menu is simple, your classic beef, chicken and falafel based middle eastern dishes with an on-the-go twist, such a great idea! 

I definitely recommend the chicken bowl and the greek fries with EXTRA GARLIC MAYO, so delicious!

The cashier didn&#39;t know their own menu when we ordered. It took half an hour to make a chicken pita sandwich and a wrap? They almost gave us the wrong order and messed up another customers order. The service wasn&#39;t very accommodating to us as customers for the mess up and the wait. Once we finally got home to try it there was little to none chicken shawarma in my pita. The ingredients seemed like chicken nuggets. Felt like I paid 9$ for lettuce. Hopefully it was just an off day for them..

We tried the hummus which was amazing and different in that it came w the traditional pita bread but also some crouton-like seasoned crispy bread(?) -- so good! Hubby had a combo platter with steak and falafel, rice and the cucumber tomato salad. I had the galagos in a pita-- it was huge! Nice touch that the pita was grilled/toasted and filled with falafel, fresh lettuce, tomato, peppers and tahini sauce--yummmmm! Ignore the haters and give them a try!"

Middleterranean is located next to a small group of great attainable restaurants in Addison - including Rio&#39;s, ZaZa&#39;s and Wok N Fire. I have eaten there twice and the food was excellent both times. It specializes in middle eastern Mediterranean food, served casually or to go. The Hummus is made fresh daily and you can really appreciate the taste. We have ordered a variety of items but the combo bowl I ordered last time can definitely be recommended. Although I am really waiting for the roasted chicken which will be available once the rotisserie arrives.

I may be biased, but I always root for local, independently owned shops and restaurants. If you are looking for a fresh, healthy and delicious meal to eat in or take out, then I would give this place a shot. I wasn&#39;t disappointed and I don&#39;t think you will be either.

Way to go Nial and Tony. Good luck with the restaurant."

Sadly, this is not it. We got the Chicken Bowl and the Steak Pita and falafel. First, they use cheap ingredients like Corn Oil. Second, they put wheat noodles in the rice, which is a problem when most Celiacs look for Mediterranean (normally being gluten free rice and more)
Lastly, the lettuce was brown and the meat was tough. They put precooked, baggies of meat on the griddle. The steak tasted reheated and was tough. The pita was only meat and no other flavors, the garlic mayo was good but I could make this at home. 
Sorry, we really wanted to like it. We wouldn&#39;t pay $30 for our lunch here again."

We were at this restaurant 2 weeks ago along with our friends and this was our first experience at Godavari. If you are a vegetarian, this place is an utter waste of money for the buffet price they charge. Although the vegetarian spread looks fine, it isnt the best value for money either. The sambar smelled and tasted bad and i had reported this to the floor Manager who was prompt in accepting the feedback although i am not sure how was it conveyed to the Chef. While Godavari may or may not agree to my review on Sambar, a family of 5 adults cannot report the same review as mine. The karakozhambu was good but the best part of the meal was Rasam which was par excellence. I haven&#39;t had a chance to enjoy such a good Rasam anywhere in Chicago. Veg Manchurian was worth the try and something which i may order as an ala carte if i were to visit Godavari once again. Their Veg Biriyani wasn&#39;t something that i would crave for being a hyderabadi.

Overall : Worth only 75% of the price they charge per meal. A good visit for a family, once in 6 months and not more frequent than that."

One of my friends was out of town and her husband jumped at the chance to go as well. 

Between us, we ordered a rice crepe, butter chicken, a spicy goat dish, tandoori chicken, a rice dish, and naan. 

Holy moly was it good!

My favorite was the butter chicken.  I shamelessly asked for a to go box for a scoop of my sauce to take home. Don&#39;t judge me.

First of all I am a HUGE fan of their Menu Names, the names were so interesting that I wanted to try almost everything.

So I have had their food on three different occasions last week .
-Dine In +Take out on a week day evening
-Weekend Buffet
-Catering Order at a friends party

Our dine in experience was a 4 star, we got an appetizer for dine in  and rest of food for take out. Their Guntur Mirapakay Bajji was excellent. It was spicy ,served Hot and perfect for a winter evening. And got their Kurnool Kodi Koora &amp; Konaseema Royyala Curry for take out,we asked them to make our food spicy and they did.
I dont know how exactly the names of the items were relevant to the areas they are named after but they were definitely good and spicy and unlike anything I have had before here in the States. Both the curries reminded me of homemade food. I thought they were slightly pricey for the portions they gave us .

Weekend Buffet was CHAOTIC .There were tonnes of items on the Buffet and I was immediately Overwhelmed ,There were almost too many options of everything like appetizers,curries, rice specials,Normally I see non vegetarian dishes clouding vegetarian dishes on a weekend buffet at any other place but this is the only Buffet that offered same number of vegetarian dishes as non veg and everything was equally good. I should really appreciate the effort that went into prepping so many items .

Pros 

-Many options to choose from both Veg &amp;Non Veg
-All items were refilled time to time
-Friendly staff 

Cons

 -Way too chaotic and no proper waiting area for incoming Crowd
 -We were a group of 9 people and our seating arrangement was tight and Dingy.
 -Styrofoam cups and plastic spoons for desert ? 
 - Fish with Bones on a Buffet? - A BIG NO NO 

My friends had a party at their place and food was catered from this place, everything was perfection, Malai Kofta and Ulavacharu were the stars. 

For a place thats  been opened for only 2 weeks this place is doing an Excellent Job ,who ever named the items on their Menu deserves appreciation.

P.S - I have never had Duck before in my life and I am a fan now ,thanks to their BEZAWADA BATHU Curry"

The food was pretty good, it was a long time coming to catch up with a friend before he moved out of the state and we had an early dinner here on a weekday so there was not much crowd.
We ordered the chicken briyani (boneless) which was a little bit of a letdown because it was chicken 65 mixed with briyani. (It wasn&#39;t dum - meaning chicken was not cooked with rice to give extra flavors)

The naan and chicken gravy was really good and spicy. The babycorn was really good. Loved it. It was a lot of food for just two guys, we ended up packing just a little. 

The price was fine, if there was a bigger group I think it&#39;s worth it."

Luckily, I had a friend whose family is from Southern India and understands this cuisine, so she could walk me through it.

They will not give you a menu when it is buffet time (lunch time specifically...I don&#39;t know if here is a menu for dinner). There are signs by each dish, but it doesn&#39;t explain what is in it. Ok, I know this is hard to believe, but I&#39;m actually not Indian. I&#39;m dumb and I need explanations. My guess is I&#39;m not the only white kid out there that needs this, so...it would be helpful if you are trying to appeal to people who are adventurous eaters but have no idea what they are doing.

The service was great, they were good about clearing plates, bringing the check in a timely manner, super friendly and thankful that we were there, I have absolutely no complaints about that.

The food does lean towards the spicier side. Not burning your tongue off hot, but enough. That&#39;s the one good thing about being able to order off of a menu is you can specify what degree of hotness you want. But, it wasn&#39;t unbearable. They have a decent variety. Some of the deserts were not my favorite, but that is my taste. The chai tea is very good. Along with the naan bread and butter chicken. You can&#39;t go wrong there.

Overall, great place, I would come back again. Nice to have a specifically Southern Indian restaurant in the area."

Godavari was able to maintain a high quality of their buffet items through the weekend lunch rush, which pleasantly surprised me.

Ambiance: 3.5*
This is a standard indian restaurant. They have a mid-sized space, which is clearly small for their popularity. They have a buffet lined along one wall and tables everywhere else. The place isn&#39;t particularly decorated, but it is kept very clean, and the furniture is new and nice.

Service: 2.5*
The service isn&#39;t particularly great, but this place is very busy and so it might be slow. The people are friendly, but nothing else. We had to wait for a long time for someone to clear our places.
Also, unusually, we had some friends who went an hour later on the same day, and they said they got some things on the buffet that wasn&#39;t there when we were seated just an hour before. I found that very strange.

Food: 4.5*
This is one of the very few specialized south indian buffets I&#39;ve been to, and I was very impressed with the food and quality. 
Generally in buffets, there are one or two dishes really good, and everything else is mediocre. I found that here, almost everything was excellent, and only one or two dishes weren&#39;t good, which incidentally turned out to be north indian dishes like shahi paneer, which they don&#39;t specialize in anyway.
They didn&#39;t have dosas, but everything there, from the appetizers to the biryani was delicious, and they were able to maintain quality through the rush. Very well managed. I can&#39;t say how authentic the food is, but it sure is tasty.
I however, was disappointed with the dessert selection, which I had high expectations from, specially after the great buffet.

Value: 3.5*
The buffet is definitely one of the more expensive indian buffets I&#39;ve had, about $20 after taxes and tips. However, the food quality is great, so it&#39;s somewhat justified.

I really enjoyed the food here, even though I&#39;m very critical about buffets. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys south indian food. Please don&#39;t expect the normal paneer, butter chicken, dal makhani, or you&#39;ll be disappointed."

Ok, not all Indian food is hot. Some of it is intentionally not hot so you can survive the next bite of the insanely hot. 

We went for lunch a couple of weeks ago, and I&#39;m so glad that the guys I went with had some sort of clue what they were eating. But the funny thing is, when we were about 1/2 done they said &#34;yeah, you never quite know what you are going to get from one Indian restaurant to another!&#34;  For example, the chips (or whatever they were called) were salty here. At other places I am told they can also be sweet, or just very plain. 

Rice dishes, chicken dishes, bread, and ochre were all very good. Tip: if it looks spicy, it probably is. If it doesn&#39;t look spicy, it&#39;s probably spicy. 

I thoroughly enjoyed lunch, and look forward to my next Indian buffet. 

Lunch buffets are common at most Indian restaurants, and the most economical way to try a bunch of dishes if you aren&#39;t sure what you like. From what I was told, these places usually don&#39;t have buffets at dinner. And while I am definitely not a huge buffet person, the food here looked fresh and well kept. Of course, it might be the hot spices that keep it fresh as well."

I&#39;m a second generation Indian American and my family comes from the andhra region of south india. Most indian restaurants in the United States lean heavily on North Indian foods. For my wedding I really wanted to have an authentic feast that represented the foods of the areas my parents grew up. 

Varun at Godavari catering helped me identify which foods on his catering menu were traditional Andhra foods and also helped me figure out the appropriate ratio of vegetarian to non-vegetarian items. He even put up with several last minute menu additions from me. They were willing to deliver all the way out to West Lafayette for me.

They were on time (which is 2 hours better than the experience I had with another Indian restaurant at a previous function), and courteous.

My guests loved the food - but found it to be very spicy (which may have been my fault as I never specified the need to decrease the spiciness). My parents and their friends loved having an authentic andhra meal and my friends loved being exposed a whole different side of indian food. 


Would absolutely recommend."

The vegetarian platter had only one Mirchi bhajia, one samosa n one bonda (without any chutneys) for $12...three idlis for $8- RIDICULOUSLY over priced. Biryani &amp; dosas were good though.

Everything on line said they open at 5:30 so I went shortly after 5:30 and there was a &#34;closed&#34; sign, even though the sign said they opened at 5:30. So I once again checked Yelp and Google and both said they should be open so I walked in. Two women were sitting at a booth chatting, and when they saw me they walked back into the kitchen away from me and didn&#39;t say anything. I stood there waiting to be seated and one of the women came back with a broom and started sweeping- not making eye contact with me. So finally I asked if I could get a table for 2 and she told me they weren&#39;t open until 6. That&#39;s fine if they open at 6, but I was more upset that I was ignored and they walked away from me, especially when they sign in the door still said 6. Kind of left me with a bad impression."

I like the buffet because I don&#39;t have to worry about what to order and can try a variety of dishes. This was the best one so far. Here are the reasons:
1) great variety and selection especially for a weekday lunch buffet
2) most of the dishes were very tasty, but be warned there were a couple that were very spicy.
3) cleanliness of the buffet serving area and the restaurant in general. It probably helped that it was newly opened.
4) the buffet included lemonade and tea.

The only thing I would improve is to have better descriptions of the food items."

I agree wholeheartedly - Excellent food, cheerful staff, and decent ambience. Compared to some Indian restaurants, they don&#39;t inundate you with a gazillion uninspired options. Instead there were enough &#39;yummilicious&#39; options of veggies/ curries, rice, starters and desserts to suit both North &amp; South Indian palettes. Didn&#39;t like waiting in line for dosas though! Still I guess that&#39;s expected from a highly popular restaurant. Being vegetarian, can&#39;t comment on the non-veg except I did see trays of those too.

 My favs? Rice payasam, fruit custard with red berry designer swirls dressing, Chole samosa chaat, kadai paneer, baby corn pakodas. 

Be sure to bring an empty tummy! ;) Bon appetit!"

Ambiance: It had a nice Telugu feel to it with all the South Indian celeb pictures that were hung up. We did miss seeing Cheranjeevi there haha! They had a nice playlist of Telugu, Hindi and surprisingly Tamil songs. It was a welcome change to the boring sitar music or even more depressing old Hindi movie songs. Kept our whole bunch quite upbeat for the reminder of the meal. 
Service: As a group of 4, we were attended upon arrival and promptly seated. We were asked about our seating preference. Glasses were refilled without having to be asked. Most of the tables were filled but we had adequate attention and not bugged to many times by the service people. Food arrives as soon as it gets ready. So don&#39;t expect your whole meal to arrive at once. I had no issues with this because everything tastes fresh and is piping hot. We had to sit our shrimp for about 10 mins to be able to eat without burning our mouth!!
Food: Oh god! This was the best part. We had a few halal people in our party and ended up getting a lot of sea food. The fish vepudu was amazing so was the shrimp fry. I haven&#39;t had such good sea food in a while. They were well seasoned and spicy. The presentation was good. We had 2 vegetarian dishes: the babycorn something and the schezuan fried rice. They were very accommodating with our request to add egg on our fried rice. I can see these being a staple for every time we come in. We got 2 different kinds of dosas: the paneer dosa and the Mysore spl dosa. They were nice and crispy, not something you can expect in any eatery on devon, and came with 3 chutneys and sambar. Exceptional. I would suggest the Mysore dosa. Even the aloo filling was quite good. Finally we got the chikakura chicken. It came with rice, but paled in comparison to the amazing sea food, shrimp especially that we had. 
Price: The prices were quite moderate for the food that is being served. 
On the whole. If you are looking for some good Indian food, this would be my number 1 recommendation. With all the seafood options it would be a wonderful halal place too. Please make an effort to drive down here and forget about Devon!"

And I extra love that there is no need to drive to Devon Ave, or Chicago.- it&#39;s right in the NW Suburb of Schaumburg!  ..

Decent prices.- generous serving sizes.  ..  Very friendly, personable, helpful, and informative Manager Guy, Gajendran, (who my Partner and I both enjoyed chatting with).- really great guy : new to America one month, and adorable!  Really good service.  ..  Everyone there enjoying the dining was (or appeared to be) Indian.- great sign (in any &#39;ethnic&#39; restaurant.  ..  I love love loved the music (it went along with videos, but I didn&#39;t really watch) - it made me so happy and so wanna dance.  The Server Manager Guy suggested I Google &#39;South Indian music video 2016&#39; - so idk the technical genre, but it was great!  ..  I kinda liked the decor (old school authentic Indian photos on the walls, and really cute and festive stuff hanging from the ceiling.  Of course a gorgeous Ganesh idol to greet at the front.

I found this restaurant in the beginning of the summer and have been going here since! 
The buffet is filled with various options which are all extremely delicious. If you are a vegetarian or a vegan, this is the place for you because there are many veggie options both during buffet hours and from the menu. 

All the dishes here are full of so much flavor and are so rich in spice. They do a great job in preparing and presenting the dishes form the biriyani to the tandoor chicken to the channa masala - everything is amazing!

Also, I must mention that everything here is fresh. Some restaurants will suprisngly serve you leftover buffet food for dinner, but not Godavari! They prepare everything fresh and tasty. 

Customer Service here is wonderful, I should mention. Everyone is so friendly and attentive to all needs. They make you feel very comfortable and invited. The vibes in the restaurant are great, atmosphere is wonderful, and music is great. 

I highly recommend this place if you are in the area or are looking for the perfect South Indian meal.

I am not going to a place where I need to beg for water, menu, food and then the bill which I feel I shouldn&#39;t  have been charged for! 
The servers are pathetic ( everyone takes time to learn but HOW much time!!? ) 
So finally after 20 mins I place my order and then 15 mins later I get something on my table which is actually to be served to the table next to me!!!! 
They come 10 mins later to say sorry and with my order and realize they didn&#39;t give us cutlery or plates! 
After 5 mins wait for cutlery and having them finally and then they disappear from the restaurant completely!! 
So I spot one of them and oh ofcourse I have a complain so he tries to avoid but in vain I don&#39;t allow him to! 
India rasam is a piece of crap (sorry for the fowl language but that&#39;s how it is) idlis probably made in the morning, rasam probably made in anger or with wrong ingredients! Extra garlic, extra salt.
Bitter to the extent that even 3 spoons of sugar won&#39;t change your taste! 
The sambhar as thin as water. Chutneys were the only nice thing along with the Dosa
After complaining to 3 waiters a lady comes and says ok sorry and takes it away! That&#39;s it! Just takes it away without saying or asking anything else.
The bill comes and with smiles server waiting for a tip probably! 
Oh and guess what I am charged not only for Wasting my time and patience that I showed but also for the rasam idli that I wish I could throw over their face! 
I decide to donate the money to them as I feel they might soon run out of business and shut down (at least I hope they do)"

My experience here was HORRIBLE.  Came earlyfor dinner...like 6 PM, and by early I mean there were probably only 3 other tables.  And you&#39;d think with it not being busy, service would be good.  WRONG.  We were seated, water glasses filled, and then the staff left to wait on the other 3 tables.  We weren&#39;t even given a menu.  Kept asking for one and kept getting the &#34;Yes one minute&#34; answer.  The staff there was running around like the place was packed AND IT WASN&#39;T!  Finally we got menus and it was the paper ones that you&#39;d get for take out.  Ok whatever.  So we looked, decided, and waited...and waited...and waited. Again, the place is still empty....but clearly we were not important.  Fifteen minutes later we finally were able to flag someone down to take our order.  We ordered apps and dinner.  Nothing came out in a timely manner.  The apps came out after half the table got their dinner order.  A few items were simply forgotten and we had to keep asking.  One of the people we were with got their dinner item AFTER everyone else was done.  Completely ridiculous.  We said we didn&#39;t want that item since hello...everyone else was done.  The waiter got mad and was like but it&#39;s already made.  We still had to pay for it even though it wasn&#39;t eaten.  

The food itself was not great.  The Dosas were blah. We&#39;ve had better (like when this place was Sankalp and Atithi).  The non south indian food was ok.  Nothing that would make us overlook the horrible horrible service.

I guess when we want South Indian for dinner, we&#39;ll have to make the trek out towards the city since this place was a sheer and utter disappointment."

Here is the rub, they packed so little sambhar that you cannot finish the dishes before running out of sambhar. I am ok with the price but c&#39;mon guys, when your Idlis and Vadas are the most expensive in Chicagoland or possibly in US, standardize on the quantity of Sambhar which should go with Idali and Vada. Don&#39;t put out less sambhar to save on carryout containers....and also keep a separate item on menu where you can charge for extra sambhar based on $/Oz for people who want to buy extra sambhar. 

You are ruining the taste and experience."

And being an Indian, I love Indian food even more which also makes me a very difficult to impress critic since I cook and eat well. There are tons of self claimed authentic Indian restaurants spread across the Chicago land but NONE and absolutely NONE are this authentic... I&#39;m totally bowled over by the authentic South Indian items on their weekend menu at Godavari... I drove 25miles to check this place out for a weekend lunch buffet with my family and I&#39;m so glad I did that. Well worth the drive and the money I spent... I never publicly admitted that I ate like a pig and this is the first time ever I&#39;m actually saying that in a review... Gongura mutton biryani, bahubali masala chicken wings, natu kodi koora, veg dum biryani, gobi manchurian, veg pakoda and carrot halwa were heavenly and out of the world... I love their open air dosas with awesome chutneys and samosa chat appetizer kinda set up outside the restaurant as you wait to be seated inside.. AMAZING.... If I could I would give 4.5 star rating instead of 5 as the service was still a bit mediocre compared to other cuisines... But I always prepare myself to expect bad service when I go to any Indian restaurant to avoid disappointment so that didn&#39;t bother me... Service wasn&#39;t horrible but they could do better...

 I wish this place was a bit close by to where I live but I know that won&#39;t stop me from visiting this place again... No wonder they were so packed... Keep up the good work, stay authentic and hire more staff for your weekend crowd..."

It&#39;s a nicer sportsy steakhouse but the prices really aren&#39;t bad. They were under staffed so the service wasn&#39;t the best but understandable because of this. 

I ordered the raspberry smash martini it was very good. I had two. The second one (assuming someone else made it) was better. For an appetizer we ordered the small pot roast nachos (they also have a large, but the small was perfect sized for two people).

For entrees, we order the steakhouse burger with a baked potato. And the spicy buffalo chicken salad and a side of mashed sweet potatoes. The salad and sweet potatoes was my order. I was delicious.

Once our waiter got to our table, he was very professional and friendly. The service seemed to be good as well."

It is on the grounds of the Arlington Racetrack, so very convenient is you are going to watch the races, or if you live nearby. 

We&#39;ve been putting off going here, mainly because Yelp shows this as $$$. I disagree and think it should be classified as $$. While there were a few items on the menu above $20 and $30+, these included freshly caught seafood and aged prime steaks. The rest of the menu (which has a variety of selections) has entrees between $10 and $20.

They also have daily drink specials. We went on a Wednesday night, so the special was Svedka Martinis for $5. They serve these in any fashion. The women at the table had Cosmos. (I do not mean to be sexist...) The men mainly had wine, but I had a dry martini. It was great.

We all had different entrees at dinner. I had their Ditka&#39;s Burger, which was a plain burger, about 1/3 pound, on a bun with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions and ketchup. It came with a load of freshly cut, and perfectly cooked French Fries.

The waiter was outstanding - Leo. He was friendly, kept coming by to make sure we had everything we needed. He talked with us on a variety of topics. Interesting guy who is very good at his job.

The restaurant has wi-fi which is good because getting a 4G signal was impossible. The bar was also nicely done, and I certainly could see myself going there with friends after work sometimes.

I really believe the fact that people have been rating the price based on their signature selections has kept people from trying it out. Exclude the steaks, and the prices are comparable to other places in the area.

We will definitely be back."

Food quality was ok, a few things over cooked, and food presentation was a mess by the time it got to our table.  

In addition I am sitting on the porch of the restaurant waiting to leave because the manager &#39;already started closing the bar&#39;. Sorry your liquor license has 2 more hours and your bar is far from closed down, take my money, and give the 10+ people that are waiting,  a drink.  

Was here last year for fireworks and the experience was 100 times better, with chairs set out back, waiters bringing drinks, and an overall better feel from staff.

I hope something changes, because if this is a sign of the future of service for Ditkas, I have to imagine it will quickly be loosing regulars for the whole chain."

Some of us enjoyed the usual turkey fixings and others dined on the best pork chops and filet ever. Much of the credit goes to Michael our server who understands that kids need to be served first while the adults have appetizers for two reasons: 1) the parents can help them before their meal arrives, and 2) kids take a longer time to eat. Michael also managed to whip up hot chocolates for the grandkids from the cappuccino maker, replenish cocktails and engage everyone at the table making us feel welcome. The meal was leisurely paced and everyone enjoyed each course all the way through dessert. Kudos to the entire Ditka&#39;s team for a memorable holiday.  Thank you!"

The food is expensive, but not tooooo expensive. Expect to pay about $16-$20 for an appetizer + meal without any drinks. But the portions were small, and that&#39;s what usually happens at places like these. One thing to note was, our food took about 40 minutes to get to our table. I&#39;m assuming they did that on purpose so we can sit and talk with each other. We all got their breakfast options, and it was good but not amazing. I&#39;m sure their dinner options are very good, this place seems popular. 

The atmosphere was amazing, very fancy and they had Ditka&#39;s jersey&#39;s and posters everywhere. Parking was super easy, they have a huge lot. Restrooms are super clean. It&#39;s a perfect place to have a group gathering, just warn your friends to bring more then $10."

Food was good, but cornflake french toast is literally one piece of toast with four berries... But it was tasty. Ambiance is great for any Bears fan. Looks like a great place to host a party of any size.

Service: very friendly, saw some bad reviews about slow service but luckily it was quiet so they were pretty attentive. Very sweet waitress dumped a whole mimosa on an under aged guest&#39;s jacket. She was apologetic, but I was surprised they gave no attempt to compensate- maybe one mimosa free? She couldn&#39;t wear her jacket out it was sopping wet.

Parking: upon arrival we were told by the man parked next to us that we were parked in two spots, even though the yellow line of his spot was smack down the center of his car. When we tried to point that out to him he told us he wasn&#39;t even in a parking spot, but yet as we were leaving his car was still there, NOT in a parking spot. Same with three other fancy pants cars. Yellow lines apparently mean nothing there as all were parked illegally. Is this regular practice?? Go ahead and park wherever you want, apparently they don&#39;t care.

Not so. After a nice afternoon at the track, my mother-in-law decided to treat us to Ditka&#39;s to celebrate my husband&#39;s birthday. It was 3:45 on a Sunday afternoon when we walked in. The place was pretty dead and there were only a few parties seated. The hostess was either having a bad day or really didn&#39;t want us there because she snarled at us when we said we didn&#39;t have reservations. She told us to come back after 6:30 PM. I get it, they had a bunch of reservations for graduations, but there was no one there at all. She could have been nicer--after all, it&#39;s not what you say but how you say it and at least tell us we&#39;d have the table for 45 minutes or whenever the reservations were scheduled to arrive. She ended up seating us in the bar at two high-top tables and told us to move them together. It was funny because the tables didn&#39;t move. They were bolted into the wall. Maybe she was new? Either way, it wasn&#39;t a fantastic birthday experience since we had to split our party into two different tables.

The food was great though. 3 of us had the fish tacos, 2 had the cheesesteak, and my sister-in-law had the club sandwich. Everyone really enjoyed their food. The fish tacos were mahi mahi which is a perfect fish for tacos. I love the slaw and sauce that they put on top.

Our server was fantastic and made up for a crabby hostess. He went above and beyond to make sure all of our questions were answered and he even brought out a fudge cake for Michael&#39;s birthday.

If you get a chance to go to any Ditka&#39;s location, you should try it, but I recommend reservations for a perfect experience."

This is why Ditka&#39;s has become one of my favorite places to go for lunch in Arlington Heights. It never seems too busy but once more people discover this restaurant, I&#39;m sure that will change. Here&#39;s some of my thoughts about the food:

Cornbread: Has a nice strong corn flavor to it with a good amount of nice chewy corn. Not too sweet, fluffy texture, and aromatic.

Fresh calamari: Excellent preparation. Every piece is fried very nicely to a crisp and the calamari has the perfect almost &#34;al dente&#34; texture to it. Both the cocktail and tartar sauces had just the right strength of flavor to complement the calamari.

Pork chop: Nice thick piece of berkshire pork chop, seasoned lightly and cooked to perfection (the juices were very well retained). The meat itself is very flavorful and tender even without the delicious apple chutney and cherry jus. The mashed sweet potatoes had a very pleasant finely mashed texture and the flavor of the root was unmistakenable (delicious).

Fried lake perch: No unpleasant fishy smell here, just excellently fried perch with delicious cottage fries (pan fried to a crisp and seasoned).

Seafood diavolo pasta: Generous portions of seafood with pasta that was cooked to just al dente. The sauce is delicious and can be prepared to be non-spicy (and still delicious)

Cuban pork sliders: Taste like a cubano, but on a bun. The flavor could be stronger but this preparation is a classier take on a classic.

Ice cream pie: Fantastically delicious dessert. Vanilla, Chocolate, and Toffee ice creams with a crust made of M&amp;Ms, nuts, and toffee and a pie base of Oreo cookie. Much better than any candy ice cream you will find in the store."

I sat alone at the dark rectangular bar. There were a few older couples as well as groups of guys sitting at the surrounding tables.  I drank iced tea and water and Ana, the bartender did a great job at keeping both glasses filled. 

I started with the habanero chicken wings. Being that habaneros are really hot, I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. I got a plate of eight wings that looked like they had been seasoned with a dry rub. The came served with a grilled lemon half (very unique touch) and a bowl of avocado flavored ranch with some chopped tomatoes on top. The wings were moist and thoroughly cooked. They had a nice touch of heat, but certainly not enough to set my mouth on fire. I went to town on the avocado ranch sauce; the coolness countered the heat very well.

I then got a turkey burger. It came on a whole wheat bun with lettuce, tomato, and grilled red onion, which I especially liked. It also had a thick layer of well-melted Monterey Jack cheese, which was a nice change from the usual Swiss or American cheese. The turkey was quite juicy and the burger was so thick I actually cut in half just to handle all the juice. I got a side of sweet potato fries while they were cooked well to a crispy finish, the portion size was quite small. I would have liked a pickle spear; that&#39;s probably my one disappointment from that plate.

I would have tried the banana cream pie if I still had room for dessert, but I was pretty stuffed. Between the wings, burger, and drink, my total came to around $26, which isn&#39;t too bad. For drinks, they had a pretty moderate wine list and a lot of local craft beers. They even have Revolution on tap, so kudos for that. Good prices, good quality food that is presented well, and friendly service. So even if you&#39;re not into the horse racing, Ditka&#39;s is still a fine place to stop for a meal or a drink."

The dining experience was Da Bomb...Very good service,  excellent food!!!
The baby back ribs were delicious (heck don&#39;t care what made it that good) coupled with the coleslaw with a hint of horseradish that was excellent.  Loved the fries. The fridge burger was probably the best burger my wife has ever had. The southern fried chicken was up their too. The house salads were very tasty and the kale caesar exceptional.

If it&#39;s presentation they are going for, they missed the ball right off the bat. The sandwich was on thick bread which minimized the flavor of the sandwich. The fries could use some seasoning, only 50% had any sort of flavor (salt).

  I also tasted our child&#39;s mas potatoes and those also lacked flavor.

  The atmosphere is confusing. Upon arriving and leaving you&#39;re surrounded by people parking in the fire lane to quickly but in bets before the &#34;big race&#34;. Really kind of makes Ditka&#39;s feel cheep.

Nice sweet-ish pot roast flavor with the cheese, sour cream, jalapeños and diced tomatoes. Yum!

The calamari was PERFECT and it is hard to find perfect calamari. It just melts in your mouth and is very flavorful on its own, but comes with tarter and cocktail sauce. I&#39;m not usually a fan of either, but both were very good, especially the tarter sauce. 

Since it was lunch time, I opted for the wedge salad. Nothing fancy, but it was fresh and crisp and the blue cheese was very good! I like my wedge salads with a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette, but this one did not have it, but that was ok with me. 

We also got the Margherita pizza. Nothing over the top, but it was good for lunch time. 

Soup of the day was a New England style clam chowder, which I did not try, but my dad did and said it was excellent. It looked yummy! 

The atmosphere of the place is very unique. Of course it has all the Chicago themed sports memorabilia, but it is done in a very classy, elegant scheme. I rather enjoyed the atmosphere actually, and wouldn&#39;t mind just sitting at the bar for a few cocktails or sitting down and having a nice meal. They also have space for private parties and I think I would definitely consider it for a birthday celebration or even a rehearsal dinner if they can swing it. 

Our server was ok. Not the best I&#39;ve had, not the worst. He did forget my salad, but it really wasn&#39;t a huge deal and after I reminded him he came right out with it.

I ordered a Caesar kale salad which was pretty good. The description said (kale romaine parmasean and Caesar). But there was definitely iceberg lettuce used as a filler (not okay). There were only 15 people in there when I want but still the service was sub par. I will probably not be returning any time soon.

He was attentive, helpful, and kind, but what he did for us was honestly surprising.

First of all, my two other friends and I were at the restaurant for The Ditka Show with Waddle &amp; Silvy.  Given that this was an event, I expected good service but not necessarily &#34;above and beyond&#34;.  We ordered the Nachos (which are AMAZING by the way - get them....the meat is tender and a great add to the already delish nachos) and right before the show started we ordered some burgers.  They arrived right before we all got in line to get autographs from DA COACH himself, so we knew we&#39;d be coming back to cold food.  My one friend and I knew what we were getting into, but we didn&#39;t care.  My other friend was just going to ask for them to reheat her burger.

As we are in line for over a half hour, Scott comes over out of nowhere and let&#39;s us know that he got approval from his manager to get us new burgers.  WHAT?!  That&#39;s sooooo nice and generous.  I understand they want us to have a good food experience, but wow that&#39;s just nice for a restaurant to take initiative and do something like that for us.  Given it&#39;s an event, I&#39;m sure the kitchen was already so busy but it&#39;s just nice to be taken cared of that way.

Anyway, I ordered the Steakhouse burger and sweet potato fries and both were delicious.  Would like to come back because they really train their staff well.

Everyone was friendly and welcoming since the moment we walked in.  Good work culture, Ditka.  That leads to a good dining experience!"

The food was pretty good, aside from the basically hard boiled egg on the Benedict. But the seafood was good, salads well done, entrees were good. My family loved the hand carved beef. Bloody Mary&#39;s were tasty. Ditka&#39;s always seems to be very good at keeping everything filled nicely.

The service was horrible. Our server, Steven, took disinterested to a new level. Around us, we heard other servers welcoming the customers and explaining where the different food items were found. Not ours. He widely gestured and said -why don&#39;t you go hit the buffet. Steven (Stephen?) was, at best, absent. 

I found out about the omelette station when my son came back with an omelette, which helped me to accidentally find the dessert table.

He came to the table, filled 2 1/2 glasses with water, out of 4. We asked for more water, and he filled one glass. It took three times asking to have my water glass filled. Getting coffee was comical. We finally asked a different server who immediately brought the coffee. Bad service truly can dampen a meal.

Disappointing."

The service and atmosphere make for a great date night. I recommend starting with the pot roast nachos!!! Some of my other favorites and recommendations are Mike&#39;s salad, seafood bisque, Da Coach&#39;s pork chops, a filet, the fridge burger, and flourless chocolate cake. Their seafood is also amazing but I don&#39;t get that too often. My son gets buttered noodles and I&#39;d say their pasta is a little weird. But overall they have a good kids menu!

This location in Arlington Heights has a terrible parking situation since you have to walk a little bit, so spend the few bucks to tip the FREE valet service. 

It is so nice to have a Ditak&#39;s closer to us! The drive to Oak Brook was getting old."

Party of 7 and we were seated in a wierd little alcove out of the main dining room up a ramp outside of a larger banquet area and the waitress had to go behind a movable partition and pop out the other end in order to wait on our entire table.  Really disappointed that they dropped the lake perch in this location - I just had lake perch at Ditka&#39;s downtown the week before!  No San Pelligrino for the non-drinkers in our group either. Had to ask multiple times for a glass for some wine (1/2 off bottles was a good deal though) after the waitress forgot.  Busser did not package my son&#39;s leftover meatloaf despite our request.  Ne explanation given either.  Not a bad place, but no where near as good as the downtown location.  I&#39;m sure Da Coach would not have approved of our service last Friday either. Not sure I&#39;ll go back, may just visit the downtown location when I can. Not a good experience...pick it up Ditka&#39;s!"

Went there for lunch, I had the shrimp diavolo pasta, husband and son both had the Fridge burger.
The pasta portion was just enough, had second thoughts due to the tomatoes but it didn&#39;t give me heartburn after, yay!  
Hubby and son enjoyed their burgers.  Our server, John, was very nice  and attentive to our needs.

I had their signature pork chop with mashed potatoes and chutney. Incredible! I usually don&#39;t order pork chops but since it was the specialty I had to try it. Huge, perfectly done, with a delicious sweet bbq sauce. Dessert was a raspberry cheesecake that was uniquely presented. Very good.

My soup of the day was an unmemorable cup of beef barley, while the Mike&#39;s salad that my wife had seemed tastier.  They had also brought out some bread which had more salt than I had ever seen on bread; it was a sort of a pretzel bread, without the pretzel part, but with extra salt to make up for not being pretzel.  The bone-in filet was pretty good.  I&#39;d say it was a little salty, except that the earlier bread put everything else in perspective.  My wife had asked for a blue cheese crust on her steak, and somehow they had forgotten to put it on, so they had taken it back after we asked about it.

The restaurant was completely under staffed and we tried to be patient as we felt bad for the servers, but when it took about an hour just to receive the soup, we knew we were in for a long night.  We asked for bread FIVE times and never received.  We had to ask 3 times just to get water, which was never refilled.  We were never asked for second drink in 2.5 hours.  In each and every course, they forgot someones food, so we sat for at least 10 minutes waiting for everyone to have food to eat.  Looking around, it seemed as though ALL the tables around us were experiencing the same thing.  We went to complain to the Manager, and there was a long line just to complain.  We were not even in a hurry, but it was ridiculous as we sat there with empty glasses and the plates from each course building up on us.  Its not like this is a cheap place, they advertise and price as a high end restaurant.

Also, to warn, we were not put in the main eating area but in a side banquet room, which was nice enough except for the table they put us at,  It was slanted and super flimsy. There was no decoration and just a number in the middle.  I was surprised it had a salt and pepper on our table.  

Its hard to judge a restaurant based on a holiday event, but we will not be returning for any meal and we will also share our terrible experience with all our friends &amp; family.  I felt the need to submit this post, so if people want to eat out for Thanksgiving, they won&#39;t make our mistake and they will go somewhere else."

Food - Broasted chicken - good flavor, good sized serving.  Crab bisque was good, but not much visible crab.  Chicken primavera - really good, nice variety of vegetables, little light on the amount of chicken, sauce was good.  Seafood diavolo - two very large shrimp; really light on the crab.  The waiter warned that the sauce was spicy, so I down graded it to mild - wish I had kept the spiciness - it probably would have been very good.  The mild sauce was just too mild.  Nice selection of wine and beer.

Ambience - just a little weird for me - Ditkas (think football), with a horse racing theme, and a Frank Sinatra singer.  I found it a little disjointed."

Seriously, not quite close to dying, but an extremely embarrassed busser shattered a glass on me while picking up unneeded glassware and cutlery.  Ditka&#39;s is nice, remodeled racetrack restaurant turned into classic chop house merged with sports bar.  One jarring note occurred as the canned music competed with the competent live music.  Not crowded on a Saturday at 7:30, we were seated immediately.  The banquets in the booths were set far from the tables, causing us to lean in to eat.  The bread was Italian and salted on the crust but good.  The waitress was knowledgable, even offering the whitefish when asked, as it was not a special on Saturday.  A great waitress knows what was served during the day for parties and what might be available.  Beer (Stella) was reasonable, $5.50 for a large draft.  The crab bisque was great, creamy and thick.  The meatloaf was good, lots of flavor with mushroom gravy ( no ketchup) mashed potatoes, lots of vegetables.  Not a huge menu, but I recommend this restaurant."

The restraint was clean on the inside and had a comfortable relaxing environment. Was like a bar that was very well matured. The cons I do have to mention is I feel some of the items are a bit over priced and parking was a little bit of a walk but really not that bad. For my meal I had crab bisque and a filet mignon. The carb bisque is more of a bisque, I don&#39;t think there was any crab in it at all. The filet was very good, cooked exactly to my preference. Had a very good texture and taste. It&#39;s not a top quality filet but for what it was it very good. The only real bad thing was that it was a tad bit over priced in my opinion but other than that, it was pretty damn good."

We had the ribs both times and they are excellent. If this was a review of only the food it would be 4 stars, but our total experience this time knocks off two stars.
First off, last time they had valet service,and tonight there was none. The restaurant has no accessibility in the front entrance and the handicapped parking  is not close to either the front or rear entrance, so valet is a must for those with mobility issues.  We asked the hostess about the valet and were told they had stooped the service due to &#34; problems&#34;. I said we had a hard time getting to the entrance with no valet service, and her response was &#34;Yeah, we&#39;re not really accessible.&#34; Nice attitude...
It got worse in the restaurant. Even though the restaurant wasn&#39;t full, our server was almost non existent once she took our order. Only stopped by once to check on us once the meal had been brought. Never came back to pour more wine from our bottle, never came back with another basket of bread that she offered to get. And we had to ask for a plate for our rib bones which should have been a no brainer.

The banquet room was opened around Easter, so we were their 3rd wedding- you would have never known! The room was set up beautifully and the service was impeccable! Usually at weddings guests have to go to the bar, but not here, the servers refilled drinks all night long! The food was amazing; people are still talking about it! We chose steak, chicken, and the pork chop and no one was disappointed! We had access to the terrace the entire evening which was utilized all night long! They had seating, tables and even the large heaters to make sure guests who stepped out for air were just as pampered as the ones in the banquet room!  It was also so nice to have access to the bar in the restaurant for guests who were early or had nowhere to go in-between the ceremony and the reception! The event coordinators also worked very hard at ensuring our day was perfect! Part of the reason we went with a restaurant was not just for the food, but for the environment! The room we were in had character and more than white walls!  They also made sure that I had nice, wooden restaurant chairs instead of banquet chairs that I would have needed to pay to cover or replace.

Appetizers, calamari and wings, were awesome.  Came with my family and most everyone enjoyed their entrees.  My biggest issue was my entree.  I ordered the filet and requested it medium.  The steak came out well done, grey all the way through.  Now I hate sending food back and almost never do it but this meat was just was overcoooked, even the waitress admitted so.  So they took it back and I waited about fifteen minutes for a new one.  Finally bring a new steak and I cut it open and it was raw in the middle.  Not pink, not red, raw.  So unfortunately again had to send it back.  Ten minutes later they bring me th steak back still undercooked but at this point I was starving so I just kept it.  Still more medium rare than medium but I just ate around the rarer parts.  But what really bothered me during this whole process is not once did any of the staff apologize for the steak being cooked wrong.  Not the waitress the first time, not the person who brought it out the second and third time, and not when they brought the bill.  They acted like it was my problem and it was just too bad they couldn&#39;t cook a steak right.  Service overall was slow, had to order a bottle of wine three times before they finally brought it and my brother&#39;s girlfriend never got her second drink.  So food is pretty good but for the prices they need to improve on the service.  I&#39;ve been to th Ditka&#39;s downtown and never had these issues."

We were there on Father&#39;s Day and had a 5:30 reservation.  We didn&#39;t get seated until after 6:15.  I understand that a holiday can be busy, but there were numerous empty tables throughout the restaurant.  When we ordered our drinks, the server didn&#39;t know what kinds of vodka they served and informed us they were out of &#34;mojito mix.&#34;  Disappointed to hear that my mojito would have been made from a mix, so glad they were out!  When our soup/salad course was delivered, one was missing.  But the server didn&#39;t come back to the table so that we could tell her about it.  By the time she did, everyone was finished so we said we didn&#39;t need that extra salad.  She apologized and offered a free dessert, which was nice of her.  Then dinner came...  Two of the entrees were incorrect, a side dish was incorrect, and the broasted chicken was luke warm at best.  My father-in-law ordered a glass of wine when our food was delivered, and the wine didn&#39;t get to the table until he was done with his meal.  At one point, our server made a comment that people just don&#39;t understand how much she has to do.  I worked in a restaurant for 15 years -- I understand  -- which is why we were patient and kind even though things weren&#39;t running smoothly.  Then the server dropped off the check, and forgot about that free dessert that she had promised earlier.  By that point, there had been so many issues, she was flustered, embarrassed, and clearly just wanted us to leave.  My first experience at this location, and was sorely disappointed."

Started with Guacamole and Chips.  Very good.  Ordered Ditka Burger and coleslaw.  Burger was good and service was very friendly.  Coleslaw was fair, not unlike something from KFC. I found the inside decor a bit strange though.  Kind of like a converted Dept Store. Not a big deal, but different.  On the expensive side, too."

BUT Mother&#39;s Day was a horrible experience.   We had reservations for dinner at6pm.   We were seated pretty near that time.  The waitress we had was doing her best BUT, water glasses never filled, empty glasses and plates never removed from the table throughout the meal.    I ordered the ribs and wasn&#39;t told until the food was delivered that were none left.    Beware broasted chicken is more like fried chicken, but it was good.    And then there were the washrooms.   Men&#39;s room (I&#39;m told ) was disgusting.  the women&#39;s room had no toilet paper, no towels, garbage cans were overflowing....is was worse than some bars.    I asked for a manager and was sent one of the hostesses that had seated us.   Finally the (a) manager came over and listened to my complaints.    He said &#34;well we had over 1000 people for brunch today&#34; I really couldn&#39;t believe he said that since I really didn&#39;t care about what happened earlier in the day.    There were 6 of us and we were spending our money on their dinner and drinks.   He apologized for everything and gave me a gift card for our horrible experience.   all in all Ditkas is a nice place, good food and hopefully they get their act together on holidays.

I have finally found my suburban gem sushi place that can hold a candle, or in this case a chopstick, to my beloved Ju Rin. The rolls aren&#39;t as big as Ju Rin&#39;s, but everything else about Tensuke Market is as good or better. 

First, let&#39;s talk about the price. It&#39;s cheap as hell. I can get twice the amount of food here than at most sushi places for the same price. TWICE, I TELL YOU! 

Second, the fish is so fresh here. No stank, no mushy bs, it&#39;s the real deal. 

Third, the spicy rolls are perfection. They have a big chunk of fish (not the mushed up mayo concoction most places pass off as a spicy roll) and they&#39;ve  got a spicy mayo sauce that is awesome. They are small, and I always ask for extra spicy mayo on the side, but they are delicious. 

Fourth, the service is awesome. They are fast (for a sushi place) and they DELIVER. Did that just blow your mind?!? Because it blew mine. 

They also have cool events (which make the place insanely crowded but they make sure to have enough staff on to handle it) and give back to their customers with special deals and yelp giveaways. Perf. 

Thank you, Tensuke Market. You&#39;ve saved me from my surburban sushi search. It&#39;s over. You win."

However, if I am in the mood for fast sushi that is actually good I would come here over Mitsuwa in a heartbeat.  Tensuke Market&#39;s food counter makes sushi fresh to order and also has a few other tasty items available, like udon.  Better still, they just added a &#34;bento box salad bar&#34; a few weeks ago.  We will definitely have to be back soon to try it - you can build your own bento box with whatever combination of the usual ingredients you want!

Besides fast food, there is also an assortment of produce and Japanese items available.  There aren&#39;t the aisles and aisles of stuff like at Mitsuwa, but you can do some quick grocery shopping here if you only need some staples."

I didnt get a chance to shop around, but we watched the Tuna cutting and received a couple samples that the owner was handing out to the crowd. Ohh, man, the Tuna was so tasty. You can definitely tell the difference in the quality vs frozen tuna at any random store. No wonder these were selling for like $80/lb. Owner was very nice, him and his father in law run the store.

We tried the food at the food court and everything was good. There was a long line, but it moved fairly quick. There are so many options of food, so at least we can look at the menu before we got to the counter to order. 

My husband and I got random items to all share and ended up taking some of it home to eat for later. Their food court is on a smaller scale and is great for lunch. Everything is so fresh and their soup base broth had a lot of flavor. Great to have for the upcoming cold weather. Will definitely plan on coming back and trying other dishes!"

Place is super clean, staff is friendly and there is a small sitting area. 

This place was hosting a 500lb tuna cutting event where they were sampling tuna. This was awesome to watch. Lots of people answer amazing experience.

Outside sitting, you can also order your food to go.

What a great experience, to both enjoy some excellent sushi and sashimi, and see how a seasoned sushi chef prepares the fish.

The cafe is in the back of a store. I&#39;ve often also come here to buy ingredients such as sauces, rice noodles, etc... The sauces are mostly the same you can find elsewhere, but they have a few unique to Asian markets. The prices are decent, and watch for daily specials.

The cafe is along the back of the store. This is a treasure of a sushi place. What they lack in ambiance is made up for with friendly and efficient staff, and excellent food. Everything seems to be prepared to order and always tastes fresh. This day, my wife tried the Dragon Roll, and I had the Salmon Heaven. Both were well prepared and presented. Something which stands out for those of us who are not from Japan or other Asian cultures is that this is a very authentic Japanese style. When I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;m one of only a handful of non-Asian patrons, which speaks to reminding people of home. When talking with those who I&#39;ve sat with, this is definitely their comfort food!

The Bluefin Tuna Cutting event was fantastic. Before heading over, we had no idea where they would put the tuna or those coming to watch. They made space in some of their eating area (guessed right to my wife&#39;s chagrin), and had people crowd around the best we could. A camera with projector was set up as well, which actually gave a decent view of the process. I wish they would have talked through what they were doing and why, though.

I&#39;ve been stopping here for probably something like 8-9 years (more?) and always enjoyed the process of deciphering the packages of tofu, trying to occasionally get past a language barrier (always OK, and the cafe is great), and enjoying some delicious sushi. Stop in for a bite and try something different!"

I have been wanting to come back, but I never seem to be in the area.  Today I was by O&#39;Hare on York Road.  The traffic on York going south was backed up because of road construction so I decided to go north on York.  Once again traffic slowed to a crawl.  Map was telling me I was going to take 32 minutes to 3.2 miles, I even tried taking 72 east, but that was closed off too just east of 83.  Next I tried going north on Busse, but quickly realized this wasn&#39;t going anywhere fast either, so being the brain I am I decided to go west on 72 even though I live on the NW side of Chicago &amp; had to east.   

Eventually I came to Arlington Heights road and Higgins.  It was 3:30 and I hadn&#39;t eaten lunch and I realized Tensuke was within my reach.  Coincidence I THINK NOT.  The gods of Japanese world willed me to that location.    

When I went in Arrrrrggg the kitchen is closed from 3-4pm, so I patiently waited for them to reopen at 4 and did some shopping for things I needed at home.  When the kitchen reopened I ordered a bento box with Katsu, salad, miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura and white rice.  Ehhhh not going to keep me coming back. 

The think I like about Tensuke is their sushi is generally better and less expensive then Mitsuwa, plus they seem to have a better selection.  I should have stuck to the sushi or sashimi instead."

We arrived a little late and they had already finished. I got there just in time to get a couple of pictures of the chef raising the remaining tuna bones above his head to show the crowd.

And, what a crowd it was. There must have been more than a couple hundred people crowded into their somewhat small space. I hoped to get a taste of the fish, but couldn&#39;t get near it. We really should have arrived earlier. But, oh well. It was still fun to see the crowds.

We did manage to pick up a few things we needed in their market while there.

Even though we couldn&#39;t get close to order any food (it was lunch time), this is still my favorite Asian market in all of Chicagoland."

They have both hot and cold food and discounts in the afternoon. There&#39;s ample seating and a nice small market for all things Japanese and yes, they have Japanese beer and whisky and my favorite - Gen Machai tea (green tea with matcha and roasted rice).

So I&#39;ll just say they have decent grab-and-go packages of sushi - I always find a few things I like, but there&#39;s no &#34;Wow&#34; factor to the packaged foods. It&#39;s fresh, tasty, filling, moderately priced, and nothing more. The restaurant area is a no-frills simple set of tables and chairs next to the grocery aisles."

Was directed here by another Yelper, who shall not be named...  The reviews were also solid, so I was excited to try this place out.

Ordered the chef choice sushi special (#3) for ~$20.  Order was up within 5~10 minutes.

Once I saw my food, I was honestly a bit disappointed.  The fish quality only looked so so... But hey, I guess can&#39;t complain at $20 for 13 pieces...

First bite, ikura.  Grains of under-cooked rice.

Second bite, tuna. Grains of under-cooked rice.

Third bite, fourth bite, all bites.  Grains of under-cooked rice!

The only thing that didn&#39;t have any under-cooked rice mixed in was the miso soup that came with the combo.  

How&#39;s it possible to still make rice wrong with all those electric rice cookers you got in the kitchen nowadays!?"

My friend and I had a hard time choosing our food because the menu is huge. We decided to go with the most basic dishes, the chirashi bowl and hand rolls (both came with miso soup) . We also ordered hot sake. The food is very inexpensive and it was happy hour so our dishes were cheaper. Big plus... We also picked up a side of uni (sea urchin)  from the fridge. 

Everything we ordered was very fresh and delicious. I especially liked the white tuna and uni. Since it is a grocery store, you can also go and pick up other drinks and snacks."

Recommendations:
- Spicy Salmon Crunch $4.79
- Crawfish Salad Roll $7.79
- Salmon Don $11.99
- Spicy Scallop Maki

On top of all that... they have a small section of Daiso!  Way too strange to see an aisle of Daiso products.  So use to seeing an entire Daiso store in LA.  

Many of their grocery products are authentic at Tensuke, which is great if you need to grab something quick.  Instead, of fighting the crowd at Mitsuwa."

Unless you don&#39;t mind making two trips. The Produce Section is very small ( some green sprouts, yams, 1/2 sliced cabbages, daikon etc.. ) 
Their food court is impressive for a tiny place. Tons of different rolls, tempura, udon etc... If you want something to go, their selection is stocked up. Tons of salmon rice bowls, croquettes, steams rice, katsu don etc.. 

They also have a tiny place for bakery goods. 

I probably wouldn&#39;t come here for stocking up purposes. Not enough variety for me to make the trip all the way here. If i lived in the Arlington Heights area, i def will frequent this place!"

Lots of Japanese staples and some housewares. The cafe is what everyone raves over: It features a lot of Japanese comfort foods, sushi, and sashimi. A number of Japanese were in the dining area eating, so it had to be pretty good.

If I spot katsu donbouri on a menu, I will go for it. So, I ordered the katsu donbouri, and a side of gyoza. 

The gyoza was not what mom makes; hers is pan fried and the skin is tender. These were hard and crunchy. Not bad, but mom&#39;s is way better. The katsu donbouri was decent, although I felt the sauce was a bit too salty. The tonkatsu was good, and the egg and veggies were portioned well. Bonus points for the pickled daikon on the side. 

The next time I am in the area, I want to check out the gyu-don, katsu curry, and curry rice...more favorites of mine. I also need to see if they carry rice makers; I need to get a new one, preferably a Zojirushi."

I never really bothered to even bat an eye at this place, but after hearing so many great things about Tensuke, I just had to try it... And I must say, the hype is real!

We went on a Saturday afternoon. The market is fairly small, but it has just about all the basics you&#39;re probably looking for when shopping for Japanese grocery. My favorite part about this place-- they have a Daiso section! It&#39;s small, but again, it has all the basics: pens, kitchen accessories, makeup, bento boxes, and more! 

The cafe is also small, but has a variety of choices to choose from. My boyfriend and I ordered ramen, tempura udon, and the salmon don bowl, and it was ready within 5 minutes! Definitely beats the 45 min wait for a small ramen bowl at Mitsuwa, plus the eating area was pretty big. 

The ramen and udon were served in very generous portions and were pretty good. Both even came with a free side! But the salmon bowl... Oh my. The salmon was absolutely the freshest salmon I have ever had in the Midwest! Melt in your mouth goodness, chilled perfectly, generous slices.. What else can you ask for? 

The food was good, and the prices were even better. Nice alternative when you want some good Japanese food and trying to avoid the always crowded Mistuwa on a weekend afternoon. I&#39;d definitely come back!"

It&#39;s definitely a market in the front, deli in the back...We did not really peruse the market. We did try the chicken sample right upon entry, my son said the chicken was medium, ha, he&#39;s six. My dad agreed, it was medium. Then we made our way to the back. 
The counter is covered in menus, much of which is far too sophisticated for me, but we figured it all out eventually. My dad had a #2 Combo, he loved it. It was a lot of sashimi, and he was pleased with the freshness of his fish and his soup. My mom and I did the #22 Godzilla roll combo. The roll was good, hints of sweetness from the sauce and a unique breading made for a good roll. This also came with soup, I did not like it as much as my dad, so I gave it to him, and Gyoza dumplings (potstickers)...they were awesome!!! A must order, an easy add on. We then split CA rolls, spicy tuna rolls and avocado rolls with my son. My son ate more than a six year old&#39;s share of California rolls. He was super pleased. The spicy tuna was also fresh and delish. 
I was highly recommend this experience. If you are versed in Japanese food, it seems to be the place to go in the burbs. My reason for four stars??? Totally for the ambiance, nothing to do with the food."

The grocery store itself has all the necessities for Japanese home cooking. There&#39;s also a cute little gifting area towards the front."

They didn&#39;t have sea urchin available so they called me right away to let me know. I ordered a lobster roll which was yucky! There was wasabi in the roll ugh. Disappointed... But the nigiri sushi Chef&#39; s Choice set was super fresh and the big nabeyaki udon was delicious with tender chicken in a rich broth.. so satisfying.. best udon I ever had! Sevice was good at communication. The food came with 2 miso soups 1 shrimp tempura and 4 gyoza dumplings which were yummy but average.

I&#39;ve only recently discovered this magical place and love it already.  The food here is amazing and the prices are great!  I&#39;ve tried both their café food and the pre-packaged food without disappointment.  They also have a Daiso section, which is a Japanese dollar store, where everything is $3.  Some of the cutest and weirdest things can be found here.

They have great sashimi you can buy and have them cut it up for you to take home.  Their prices are very competitive compared to the big box stores like H-Mart.

From the Café (M-Sa 11A-730P, M-Th closed 3p-4p, Sun 11A-7P):
Tonkotsu Ramen $8.70 - Great broth, rich and creamy and it comes with a side!  I went with Gyoza and it was good.
Big Dragon Roll Set $11.45 - Comes with choice of side.  The eel on this roll is tasty.
King of Salmon Roll Set $11.75 - Comes with choice of side.  The sauce is so good!
Pork Cutlet Curry $9.95 - Aka Pork Katsu - Comes with a side salad, tons of rice, good curry sauce and great deep fried pieces of pork.
Chirashi Bowl Set $9.95 - The sushi rice here is awesome and this came with tons of it under the assortment of nigiri - tuna, salmon, yellowtail, octopus, whitefish, shrimp, surf clam, egg custard, and shiitake mushroom.
Yakisoba $5.95 - I really like their noodles with thin beef slices and vegetables.

Located in the same plaza as Elk Grove Bowl."

I ordered udon and tonkatsu ramen with a side of California roll (extra $2 charge, don&#39;t think it was worth). For only around 9 bucks, the serving size was huge! I would give the udon a 4/5
the tonkatsu ramen was delicious as well, also ranging at around $9. the only problem I had with it is that the 2 pieces of meat were too thin and the broth was slightly too salty for me. but because of the price and how fast I was able to get the ramen, I would rate it a 4.5/5. Will definitely come here again.
for dessert I ordered green tea soft serve. most definitely the worst gtsf ic ever eaten and will never buy it again. you can choose to get it in a cup or cone."

This is a small store with maybe 6 or 8 rows of groceries and Japanese dollar store items.  So, if you need long driving gloves to protect your arms from the sun, this is your place.  

I took my two kids to have lunch there.  My daughter got the Nabeyaki Udon and my son and I both got a bento box with tonkatsu (pork cutlet).  The bento box consisted of the rice, miso soup, tonkatsu, cucumber (not really namasu, more like a soy sauce vinegar combo), tempura (shrimp, pumpkin, carrot, broccoli, and sweet potato), 2 pieces of sweet tamago (egg), and 3 small spring rolls.  It was a lot of food for $11.  To break it down.  The tempura was light and crisp.  The tonkatsu was fine.  Their miso soup was very tasty.  The dashi (soup base) was probably the same as the udon.  Both broths were very flavorful.   The udon came in a large bowl and was filled with shrimp tempura, a boiled egg, aburage, nori tempura, fish cake, cabbage, etc.

I do have to say their menu is very difficult to read.  Each item has a picture and there are lots of items, so it could be intimidating if you have never been before or are not used to Japanese food.  

There was a constant lunch time stream of customers.  I thought the prices were very good for the amount of food served.  We will definitely be back again."

Tensuke is a lot smaller than mitsuwa and they carry less grocery items and other stuff.  I came here mostly for their sushi though. 
The review is for their sushi. 
I arrived right at 3:55 pm and it said they were closed 3-4 so heads up! Luckily it was only a 5 minute wait. 
They have lunch deals at 4 pm for dine in.  I ordered the chirashi bowl for $8!! Yes, $8! (Regular times it&#39;s $10)That&#39;s unheard of!! It also comes with miso soup.  They served it quickly and it was delicious, the fish was fresh, and the rice was nicely seasoned. It had one piece each of the assortment of fish, I want to say around 8 pieces of fish, slices of cucumbers, shiitake mushrooms and tamago.  there is quite a substantial amount of rice in that bowl so if you&#39;re not full with just the fish you will be full after eating the meal.  The miso soup was a little too salty but it was good.  
I ordered a volcano don to go to try it and it&#39;s also tasty :) 
Their sushi is such a great deal!! 
If I lived close by I would probably go there almost everyday!!"

Yes, quality of the Japanese groceries/produce is better at Tensuke than Mitsuwa. Yes, there are always some items I&#39;m not able to find at Tensuke...that&#39;s why I go to Mitauwa afterwords.

I have good news, Tensuke gives you a dose of Japanese culture, food and fare, for a fraction of the cost of a one way flight. 
I had no idea that this little shop hosted such a variety of fresh fish. That&#39;s just the 1/2 of it- it&#39;s a family owned joint, and they get fresh shipments of fish 3-5 times a week. Tensuke, just made fresh affordable- on a whole new level. They have a wide variety and offer it at a fraction of the price of restaurant takeout. They had UNI!!! On a Thursday! 

I used my food cost savings to purchase my own chopsticks, and soy sauce dish from their $3.00 each section. 
It took all of my will power not to purchase allllllll of the Mochi they had. I stood staring at the waist high chest freezer, daydreaming up ways I could fit the entire freezer into my coupe. Trunk, nope. Backseat, nope. Remove front seat.... Maybe.....nope. They have quite the selection and at a great price too! 

I got more than my fair share of fish, and I&#39;ll do it again, probably sooner than I&#39;m comfortable stating. 
Outside of fish-they have all of the fun, unusual Japanese candy you can imagine. Stocked aisles of mint chocolate chip kit-kat bars, cups of jelly like candy, powdered candy, botan-rice candy (a favorite of mine)... And other items I&#39;m not sure how to appropriately describe.
Oh yeah- they have Matcha!! If you&#39;re a tea junkie, or health nut, get it here!
They have a full cafe in the back where you can order sushi to your liking, as well as hot items too. Everything I&#39;ve tried so far, has been remarkable!

Bottom line? You need to experience this place. Come early, they close at 8pm on week nights, and let yourself wander through the aisles - it&#39;s a vacation from the drab (in contrast) American goodies we&#39;re used to shoveling in."

I usually go for either a specialty roll or nigri set with miso soup and mini tempura udon as my side, and this comes out between $10-15.  Fish seems better quality than Mitsuwa and made to order.  Great value for the price!

The grocery side is very basic.  Candy and snacks selection is good, as with sushi grade fish, but don&#39;t see much produce. There is also a small Daiso $3 section, which I&#39;m a fan of, but the price point is double that of the West Coast.

Bottom line: Go to Tensuke for delicious, yet affordable sushi where you can pick up Japanese essentials."

It&#39;s a hole in the wall Japanese market with a little food court / cafe where you can order food. Apparently, they also deliver! There is plenty of seating in the back, though. If you have some time (or before or after you shop in their grocery/market section), you can order your food and enjoy there.

The Tonkotsu Ramen set is pretty legit -- I usually base my review of ramen on the soup, then the noodles, and then the other toppings. The soup is pretty substantial and thick. The noodles were OK, I think I&#39;ve had better noodles. The toppings were on the Ok side as well. Overall, not a bad bown of ramen. Santuka (at Mitsuwa) probably has a better bowl...

The rolls are great here. They definitely don&#39;t skimp on the ingredients and their fish is fresh. I can get full off one roll here, that&#39;s how large their rolls are.

I&#39;ve had their udon to-go, and the soup was pretty good, as well as the noodles. I wish I could have eaten it freshly made at the store, but my boo ended up picking it up on his way home. I&#39;ll have to try it in the food court next time, since that usually makes a big difference on the taste and quality.

There is a $1.50 merchandise section, where everything is only $1.50 (Marukai). You can find some pretty awesome stuff here, but don&#39;t go too crazy! It can quickly add up before you know it."

The restaurant section in the back is good. Their sushi taste fresh their maki rolls are pretty good. Today I tried takoyaki here for the first time. It has a slight bit of an acquired taste but it was good.

I have a few favorites in the market part as well. The plum wine tastes AMAZING, nothing like I&#39;ve ever had before. I also snack on the coffee candy that they sell here. Keeps me awoke at work. Overall, if you&#39;re into Japanese cuisine, this spot is worth a definite shot!"

I have tried everything on the menu from nigiri to ramen.  Everything is tasty although I wouldn&#39;t go there specifically for Ramen.

Also they will customize rolls to the best of their abilities. Veggie rolls run around 4-5 dollars max. The miso soup is on point with a mild flavor of Dashi, tofu, and seaweed (I suggest a bit of Sriracha for some spice). The rolls are large and it&#39;s hard to beat such fresh sushi at a very reasonable rate. I will definitely be back and there&#39;s a high probability of becoming a regular!!!

Service:  Folks were patient and nice as my grandfather decided on what side to order with his meal.  (He settled on gyoza, and then ended up eating only one and making me eat the rest of them!)

The menu is enormous, and the quality seems pretty good from the various things I tried while I was at the Yelp event.  I was especially excited about takoyaki (fried balls of octopus, think really tender hush puppy with octopus cuts in it), a rarity to find at any cafe/restaurant.  It didn&#39;t disappoint.  But for my meal with my grandfather, I ordered up:

Katsu-don: Pork cutlet over rice, plenty of rice, plenty of pork, fried nicely, and then covered with the sauce for a delicious texture and flavor.  While the katsu-don at Mitsuwa is executed better IMHO, the price here is a few bucks less, which makes a big difference!  Very tasty, and still very filling.

Verdict:  VERY affordable and reasonable prices for good quality food.  Excellent service, and you can grocery shop when you&#39;re done?  Definitely looking forward to having more meals here!"

The restaurant has a variety of offerings from sashimi to ramen and grilled fish. The food as well a grocery items are seemingly cheaper than Mitsuwa as well.  There&#39;s even a small Daiso shop inside, (Daiso is somewhat like a Japanese dollar store from Japan, a friend told me you could buy everything you need in life at Daiso... Just not the Daiso at Tenuske) 

The ramen is alright, I&#39;ve had the shoyu a few times before, and honestly I&#39;d drive a few miles away to Ramenhouse Shinchan instead, but if you want your fix, don&#39;t expect too much. The sashimi always tastes much fresher than Mitsuwa (did you know Mitsuwa uses a machine to make their sushi dishes?) And its reasonably priced. I like to pick up matcha powder for the work week here as well. 

Great place to stop in for a quick bite or necessary groceries."

Super fresh sushi and a price that cannot be matched for the quality and significant portions. I have the tekka don (tuna bowl) and as always it is super fresh and a mountain of sushi that brings an immediate smile to my face...

The cat is out of the bag, people know that this is literally the best deal for Japanese food and sushi in the Chicagoland area. period. The high quality and the relax cafe in the back ground make sushi an accessible thing for anyone...(aka no tipping and reasonable pricing) if you order anything on the menu you will love it. And that&#39;s the bottom line (cause stone cold said so lol); some favorites include tekka don, big spicy scallion set, udon set, chicken karage (aka Japanese fried chicken).

This is a smaller Japanese store than Mitsuwa with a small food court in the back. I like that it&#39;s not crazy busy as Mitsuwa and was able to get a table. My husband and I love ramen and that was what we came here for. They have limited options for ramen...I think 3 kinds  and not as much varieties like Santouka at Mitsuwa. We both ordered the Tonkatsu ramen set. It comes with a side. I had the mixed rice while my husband had the gyoza. He liked the gyoza. The portions are big and it is cheaper than Santouka. I also bought some sushi from the front (Canadian roll). The sushi was more expensive but it was tasty. We both liked it! Both my husband and I like the ramen at Santouka more..the broth at Tensuke was just ok and the noodles were a bit too soft for our liking. 

After we ate we went to buy fishes and groceries to make sushi for dinner. The prices for the fishes here are more expensive than Mitsuwa. We felt prices here overall cost slightly more than Mitsuwa. The quality and taste of the fishes are comparable.

However, it was closed from 1500 hour to 1600 hour, Mondays to Thursdays, and it was our luck to miss it (we arrived on site at 1533 hour).  

Thus, we had to come out with Plan B.  Fortunately, there were sushi, California rolls, hot bentos, hot entrees, and sashimi in the market place.  There was seating available, but we decided to enjoy the food at the comfort of our apartment.  

We picked out the salmon belly teriyaki with white rice ($4.25), pink snapper with brown rice bento ($7.99), a can of Japanese-style oolong tea ($1.09), and a can of UCC Kona coffee ($1.89).  

We didn&#39;t see the freshest quality of seafood, and that was why we forwent the sushi and sashimi (my all-time favorite thing to eat).  However, the entrees all tasted authentic, like what they would serve in a Japanese restaurant.  Although we were pleasant with our purchases, we wish that the food court was open for our convenience because we were TRULY hungry.

The entire market venue is considered as small-scaled, in comparison to the famous Mitsuwa Market in Arlington Heights.  Nevertheless, they carry the basic essentials for Japanese groceries, snacks, rice, beverages, and even books.  As a matter of fact, there&#39;s a minute bookstore on the back of the market.  I&#39;m aware that Mitsuwa has a full-sized bookstore by the entry.  

To sum up, Tensuke and Mitsuwa share similarities, in terms of the items they carry and made-to-order food they serve.  I found some prices at Tensuke were better than what I saw at Mitsuwa back in November; Tensuke currently has many canned beverages on sale for a little over than one (1) buck.  For something that is imported from Japan, that&#39;s not a bad price point at all in my opinion."

This is the only Japanese market I know of in the area. The groceries are limited because it is a smaller store, but I came for the cafe portion. 

It was packed on a weekday lunch. I actually visited here once before my Yelp days when I was interning in Itasca (a nearby town) and my co-workers brought me to this place. I thought it was great back then, and the fantastic-ness of the cafe has not diminished. Since I am no longer a college student, I cannot tout the famous line &#34;since I&#39;m a poor college student I need to save money.&#34; Instead, I am the not poor, but stingy recent graduate with an entry level job. I love consuming raw fish, but I never understood how Sushi restaurants manage to charged $2 for jolly rancher sized piece of raw fish. Blasphemy! At Tensuke, they lay out pre-weighted filets at price/pound for your choosing. You can either take it home and cut it into whatever shape you desire, or have the chefs pretty it up for you so you can enjoy it in the cafe. 

Of course, there are many other options on the menu other than sashimi from adding a (substantial) side Japanese curry to your order for only $1.00 to some authentic tasting tonkotsu ramen. Oddly, I do not like legitimate Japanese ramen. I think it has something to do with having too many of those Korean Shin Ramen as a child so I cannot speak to how good Tensuke&#39;s ramen is even though I got an order of it.

Pro Tip: check in the refrigerated section for those rice cake balls with sauce on them. I have no idea what they are called but I have seen a bunch of anime characters eat them so I got a box of them myself to test it out. T&#39;was delicious. Didn&#39;t taste very fresh, but I have never seen those things elsewhere in the U.S. Beggy can&#39;t be choosy

I just wish the cafe didn&#39;t use so much plastic. I just feel so wasteful throwing away plastic of any sort now. I&#39;m sure it is probably cheaper to use throwaway utensils and plates than to hire a designated miserable dish washer..."

I definitely feel that things are fresher here. While the quantity is not HUGE, the quality is excellent. I bought some packaged sashimi in their refrigerator section. The uni (sea urchin) was from California and were some of the biggest and tastiest I&#39;ve ever had! The price was $16.95 but was worth the splurge for this special treat! I also tried out the mackeral which was marinated well and super fresh and surf clam which deliciously sweet and tender :)

I tried the big scallop roll and tempura appetizer from the food court. The scallop mixture was a little bland for my taste and were piled on top of &#34;crunchy&#34; california roll which I thought was stuffed with too much crunch. It came with miso soup which was good and 3 pieces of sushi which were decent. The tempura was fried deliciously but I did not like the selection of veggies used. It was a lot of potato ish foods but then they did list it out on the description and I didn&#39;t pay attention to it. I was hoping for more light vegetables like asparagus, zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, string beans, etc.  

The service was fast and prompt which I enjoy. No need to compete with others for seats even on a Sunday afternoon which was nice! Will definitely come back again!"

I planned around lunch, and took advantage of the sushi counter. Ended up with a &#34;king of salmon roll&#34;, which was a spicy/crunchy California roll with seared salmon on top. It was good - fresh tasting, with good fish, and a nice seared, grilled flavor on the salmon. For the $12ish cost, it was a good sized helping as well, and came with miso and gyoza. The gyoza were nice and crispy, with a good filling. So that&#39;s a plus. Worth noting that they do have takeaway as well, and it looks to comprise most of the sushi options on the menu, although not 100%. There are some noodle and katsu options too. If I had to compare sheer breadth of menu to what&#39;s on offer at Mitsuwa? I think Mitsuwa still wins, especially when you consider ramen/noodle and katsu options. But then, I do kind of think that the sushi I had here was better than Mitsuwa. I should try the ramen and other items to be a little more informed here. A huuuuuge plus for Tensuke is that it&#39;s far less of a zoo compared to Mitsuwa. I just...walked in and sat down. At lunch time. On a Saturday. Which is flat *impossible* at Mitsuwa.

The grocery section is nice, but again, much smaller than Mitsuwa (which I find bewildering). Just smaller selections of everything, although I think prices are competitive with Mitsuwa. They do have a nice snack/candy selection, which is usually where I seem to focus.

This is a very strong 3, and I will absolutely be back, I want to try more items from the menu so I can really do a fair &#34;cafe&#34; comparison with Mitsuwa. So far, I agree with the review theme, that sushi here is better than at Mitsuwa - but can it compete on ramen?"

You could dine in or take it to go, plus you could pick up ingredients to roll your own sushi!

My wife and I dined in for a quick bite, and I&#39;m glad she pushed me to check it out. Pull into the parking lot, walk to the back of the store, and marvel at all the choices you have before you. I ordered a roll of spicy scallop and a bowl of tonkotsu ramen noodles.

While waiting for our order, we walked around the grocery store. There is even a corner of the store that has al kinds of Japanese knick knacks - Hello Kitty is definitely present!

After picking up our completed order, we sat at the &#34;bar&#34;. I started with the spicy scallop which was buttery smooth. This is what good sushi tastes like!

Moving on to the Tonkotsu ramen, I was pleased with the quantity of noodles and all the trimmings. It was all there, including the pork. For less than $9, this was a nice deal! It&#39;s not as good as Misoya or other ramen shops, but for a quick lunch/snack, this hits the spot!

I&#39;ve only gotten sushi and a bakery item here so I&#39;m rating Tensuke based on that.  The first time I came to Tensuke I ordered sushi made to order during my lunch hour.  I can&#39;t remember the roll I ordered but it cost around $11-$13 and came with soup I believe?  Sorry I am not being very helpful at all but I can tell you that the sushi was good!  I do remember the service being slow and I waited at least 10 minutes for my food to come out, but we did come at a busy time.  

The second time I came, which was today, I bought 2 pre-made rolls from the refrigerated section.  My two rolls were a soft shell crab (SSC) and a spicy tuna, salmon, and avocado roll.  Both rolls were good but I was partial to the latter roll only because it&#39;s hard to enjoy a cold SSC roll.  SSC rolls are meant to be freshly fried or at least lukewarm when eaten and mine was cold and not crispy, which was to be expected..since it was in the fridge haha.  They give a hearty amount of tuna and salmon in their rolls which is much appreciated and their rice to fish ratio is much better than Mitsuwa&#39;s sushi.  Tensuke is a smaller, less overwhelming version of Mitsuwa.  I&#39;m not saying one is better than the other because they both have their pros and cons.  

One pro is that Tensuke is across the street from Busse Woods Forest Preserve and the Elk Pasture so on a warm day you could grab your sushi and chill with the elks.  On the other hand Mitsuwa has awesome ramen and a large food court.  I suggest you check both Tensuke and Mituswa out!"

They were so friendly and people sit with any strangers, just like in Asia when you go to a busy restaurant. 

The food was excellent based on my expectation. We ordered a bunch of stuff: grill salmon, chirashi bowl, squid dumpling, cold noodle.  Everything tastes great. I rated a 4 star because my chirashi bowl had too much rice and not enough sashimi."

The grocery store is very neat and clean.  They have a nice selection of fish with no fishy smells that seem to permeate other markets.  The produce selection is limited but they do have some good bakery items.  

They offer grab and go sushi.  If you have time stop by the food court for sushi and other Japanese dishes.  We had a spicy tuna and Dragon roll that came with miso soup and a very small amount of seaweed salad.  The salad was excellent and the sushi was much better than Mitsauka.  While sitting I saw so many tasting dishes being served that I can&#39;t wait to go back.  Very good food and excellent prices."

Mitsuwa is probably 10x the size of Tensuke. Food wise Tensuke has more options, they&#39;re cheaper, and tastes better. Tensuke for food, Mitsuwa for groceries. 

Stopped by on MLK day for brunch. I looked through some Yelp pictures so I knew what to expect already. They have plenty of options on their food court menu. Menu consisted of Chirashi bowls, ramen, and assorted sushi. There&#39;s fresh sashimi in the grocery aisle that you can purchase and ask the sushi bar to cut and serve. 

Tonkatsu Ramen was great. 
Chirashi bowl was cheap and delicious. 

Great place, too bad I live in the city or else I&#39;d stop by for their happy hour deal $8 Chirashi bowls! 

Overall 

Small market inside of a plaza don&#39;t let the exterior fool you, give it a try. 
Fresh Sushi cheap Chirashi bowls. 
Definitely stopping by again if I have the chance."

The main event here is the sushi. They have dine-in, take out (both pre-made or made on the spot) or delivery (but you have to order something like $30 worth of food). All different choices, everything delicious....just...sushi heaven.

The market was a little smaller than I thought. They have Japanese candy, drinks, pastries, some other cooking essentials, chop sticks (duh), and a little produce. They have a lot of seafood here that you can&#39;t find in other stores (like octopus), and a variety of roe. If you want to make your own sushi, this would be the place to come and buy your goods.

Nice staff, clean environment, just a happy place overall. There is also a check-in deal for $7.99 sushi happy hour (I wasn&#39;t able to use it since it was Sunday morning/afternoon), but it is a good deal if you can use it!"

If you are in a hurry, they also have an excellent selection of Sushi, Sashimi, Fish and other Japanese specialty items in the coolers-  but you can also order ahead online  for everything you desire in case they are out of the item you want and do not want to wait.   We have ordered many party trays which you can design yourself or let them make up the tray for you.  

They have expanded the dining area in the store. The dining area can be crowded during peak times,  and if the weather is nice we call in an order for pickup and eat across the street in the picnic area at the forest preserve.  

They also have classes including a great sushi making class for a couple or two couples which is a lot of fun!"

Maybe it&#39;s because my experiences here have been so consistently solid that I took this place for granted.  The food is good, and it generally comes out quickly.  (I can only recall one time in particular when it took us forever to get our food.)  I always get the beef don, which as I like to say, has only the things I like and none of the stuff I don&#39;t.  My fiancee is more varied in her choices, but she usually gets some some sort of roll, and she typically enjoys what she orders.  The staff here is also nice and are quick to get any utensils or sauce you need.  

If you&#39;ve got extra time, stroll through the market.  You may not end up buying anything at their price points, but at least you&#39;ll have way to burn off some of those calories you just gained at the cafe.  (And if you&#39;re looking for something to soothe your sweet tooth, make sure to hit up Jarosch Bakery just a few doors down.)"

This place is known for incredible delectable ham cut from the bone.  It&#39;s flavorful.  It&#39;s tender.  It&#39;s just the right salty-hammy-fatty melt in your mouth delicious.  

I ordered their special Sweet potato Skillet.  It was a crazy generous portion of ham, sweet potatoes, cheddar cheese and FOUR eggs.  I opted for only 2 eggs but honestly next time I won&#39;t - I&#39;ll keep the 4 as my take-home portion was easily another 2 meals for me.  So delicious.  Next time I&#39;ll ask to add on cooking diced onion along with the ham and sweet potatoes.  I absolutely loved it.  

My husband ordered their Meat Lovers Skillet.  Again 4 eggs!  His plate was a mountain of potatoes, ham, bacon, sausage, and cheddar cheese (you have to ask for cheddar otherwise you get American cheese).  My man is a big guy (over 6&#39;3&#34;) and can he eat!  He still took about half home.

You also have a side of toast.

Both skillets were $8.95 each.  Just... wow.

The service was warm and friendly even though they had a line of waiting hungry diners that lead out the door.

We will definitely be coming back ourselves and bring every relative and friend that comes to visit.  Y U M M Y!!!"

horrible. We were told we would be waiting 15 minutes for a table of 3. 15 minutes turned into nearly an hour. Halfway through our wait a group of 17 came in and suddenly they no longer seated people. There was one man seating people and he seemed to be busy doing everything else but seating people. There were 4 tables cleared off and other people clearly getting ticked off and nobody was getting seated. It was clear those tables were for the group of 17. It was horribly unfair and bad customer service. I love the food here but this experience really tainted my love of this diner.

The table of 17 never came back. They lost a ton of customers for no reason."

I am pretty sure they used ground beef and green peppers instead of the chorizo and jalapeño in our omelets. It was so bland. How can a spicy omelet be that bland! Anyway, the side of fruit was impressive and my daughters chicken sandwich was good so she was happy. The adults, however, not as impressed.

The skillet ( actually served on a plate) is comprised of crispy hash browns, covered with no less than 8 oz of their awesome ham, 2 slices of ubiquitous American cheese singles, and (4) eggs, prepared any style. With a few slices of toast, ur good to go.  I can never finish,  but I always take the remains to go.  Not only do I take my leftovers, but Mr. A&#39;s also sells ham bones.

I understand that it is not a fine dining establishment - it is a small diner in the suburbs with a family style setting.

That being said, we had counter seats by the kitchen. We ordered the daily soup, which I believe was cream of chicken. Lets be clear, I was not served soup. I was served some kind of overly gelatinous mixture (the texture made me feel sick) that was extremely over-salted. And the chicken in it was two pieces about the size of a penny. I actually couldn&#39;t eat it and asked to have it removed from the bill.

We both then ordered some version of a hash. I had sunny side up eggs. They served it with american cheese slices that were not even melted. I don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s just cold slabs of cheese, I&#39;ve never been served that on a hash; it has always properly been melted. I asked our waitress about it and she snapped (very rude service) that she could just microwave it. I ordered sunny side up eggs. If you microwave it then they will cook. I feel like this was an extremely uneducated offer from the staff.

In addition to all this, as I watched servers carrying plates of food from the kitchen counter to tables, I felt their method was very unsanitary. I am aware of stacking multiple plates at a time by a server, but I saw multiple occasions in which a server put one plate of food directly on top of another. As in, the bottom of one plate that had been sitting on a counter that is already less sanitized, was then stacked directly on another plate, on top of someones hash/eggs/whatever someone had ordered, which they would end up eating.

Overall, worst dining experience to date. I just can&#39;t support a restaurant that offers such a bad quality of food and then tops it off with poor sanitation and such rude service."

Since they have a reputation for their ham, I opted for a Ham &amp; Cheese skillet and it did not disappoint. Huge portion that I couldn&#39;t completely finish for only $7.50. I also ordered Corned Beef Hash - it&#39;s the canned variety which I&#39;m fine with - often that is better than places that fail miserably doing their own homemade version. The hash was good as I expected, the only bummer was that compared to the rest of the menu, it&#39;s not a decent value ($3.99) for the portion size.

Large OJ at $2.25 was a good deal too. Had a great waitress (Becky, I think?) and enjoyed a great meal. Definitely a go-to place for a traditional, laid back breakfast."

Imagine surfing through a cornucopia of breakfast possibilities and landing on an omelette special: jalapeno, cheddar, and onions stuffed between thin layers of eggy goodness. Oh, and I added ham. Of course I did. This mammoth (sans ham) also came with hash browns and your choice of toast or pancakes, all for $6.25. It was delicious. It was huge. It was legendary.

We asked our contact if there was a good place for breakfast near by.  He asked if we liked ham.  Answering we did he suggested Mr. A&#39;s and said they&#39;ll kill Ya with the ham there and they will.  The fresh fruit is always very good too even in the winter and out of season for the area.  Been going back ever since.  We live close to 200 miles away but still try getting there as often as possible.  Upon occasion we&#39;ll go down for Sunday breakfast.  Have made the drive a number of times to get a ham for Christmas.  Obviously we&#39;re not there often but the owner always remembers us as do a couple of the waitresses.

I had 3 eggs with ham, hashbrowns &amp; toast. A lot looked great on the menu but I was on a swine mission after hearing they had the best ham around! Let me say, their ham is AMAZING! I shamefully love all piggy meat and ham is my forte. It&#39;s so thick, not overly salty...my mouth is sitting here watering just thinking about it. The eggs, pancakes and toast were good, as well.

I had the #3 with sausage links. It was nice to see that their sausage was not too salty like many other places. French toast was simple and tasty. Eggs perfectly cooked. Bf had the denver skillet. While I am not a big fan of ham, damn that was some good hearty ham, as that is what they are known for.

So much food for such an affordable price. Now, I know their service is great because I drink a ton of water wherever I go, and my glass was ALWAYS filled (I&#39;m talking 5+ times). We went in at about 10am on Sunday and was immediately packed after we were seated, so I would be weary of that. Great homely place."

I think the reason why I like it so much is the fact that the food comes out in about 5 minutes.  Even when the place is packed, everything runs smoothly and quickly.  And it&#39;s not because they are just trying to rush you in and rush you out.  They are constantly coming by to check on you, refill water, drinks, coffee, ask if you need anything, etc.  

Now the food:  Where else can you get a slab of ham about the size of half of a large dinner plate with whatever sides are part of your order (pancakes, eggs, biscuits, gravy, a refrigerator, etc.) for about 7 or 8 dollars?   It&#39;s awesome!

Servers are incredibly nice, punctual, friendly, and helpful.  This is such an improvement from such places as Palatine Inn and Red Apple where they can be very rude.

But it&#39;s their ham off the bone that people rave about... So here goes... Dim the lights, please... Turn up the music a little more... now crack a glowstick and shake it vigorously and just feel the vibrations...

Wait, wrong rave.

Their ham is so thick and juicy and, dare I say, smokey. None of that pressed canned ham here. This is the Tom and Jerry classic bone in ham.

It really does feel like a cat and mouse game, that is, trying to score some ham off of my five-year-old son&#39;s plate. I went to reach for a piece and he jammed his fork in my wrist, sent a left upper cut to my jaw, and then slammed my face onto the table.

You come into this place and it is a neighborhood diner feel, which is fantastic. Everyone in there looked like a local, people were noshing and enjoying their Saturday brunches/breakfasts. We were served quickly but also felt like we were being rushed out despite the place not being full. We were asked whether we wanted to bring the food to go about 5 minutes after we received our plates. The ham is not as good as I had imagined, it didn&#39;t taste unique or honestly, that great. It was quite salty albeit it was a thick chunk of pork. 

The rest of the food was to be expected, nothing surprising and nothing delectable. Its normal diner food. One great thing though? Staff is nice and the prices are affordable. 

Afterthought: They have a funny sign at the cashier register that says they accept checks, but only up to $20 max. And in order for them to cash those checks, they require 6 pieces of ID and $50 cash deposit until the check clears. WOW! That is one way of getting people to not use checks!"

Really, completely average, kind of like how your mom&#39;s homecooked food.

However, this restaurant probably has enough pluses to outweigh considerations about the food. The only remaining negative would be the decor since this place is a bit tight (not because the restaurant is small, more because there&#39;s a lot of customers) with simple decor. However, the service is fast and friendly. The portion sizes are amazingly big (2-3 plates usually per order) with very cheap prices.

It was suggested by one of them (who insisted that I just *had* to try the ham) and she has led us astray before, so I was more than slightly leery.

As it turns out, I needn&#39;t have worried!!!

This place is amazing!!!  It wasn&#39;t that busy when I walked in at 9--my friends were already seated (however, when we left at 10:45, it was REALLY busy.  Like out-the-door busy!) so if you&#39;re going to come here and you don&#39;t want to wait, you need to come early!

So our waitress was really on top of things!  She was right on top of refills, ordering, and splitting our tab five ways wasn&#39;t a problem.  She was a sweetheart overall!

But onto the food.  Ohhhh, the food!!

I got a Denver Skillet.  It comes with &#34;American Fries&#34; (hash browns), and huge chunks of the world&#39;s best ham (seriously.  it&#39;s the best I have ever had!!!) and LARGE onion pieces as well as green peppers.  The flavors melded together to have one of the best parties my taste buds have ever had!!

It also comes with eggs and a choice of pancakes or toast.  I chose pancakes and my eggs over easy on the side.  The eggs were standard (good, but standard), and the pancakes were good as well.  But most of my efforts were concentrating on my skillet.

Our waitress didn&#39;t even seem to mind the fact that we were there for almost two hours.  She was sweet and pleasant the whole time.

The eggs and breakfast potatoes were so bland, they were beyond saving. No combination of salt, pepper, ketchup, and hot sauce could bring these back to life. Someone needs to introduce the kitchen to a spice rack. My buddy ordered a Denver skillet, and the cheese that came on top was five slices of melted Kraft singles. Gross."

The breakfasts are huge and I mean huge! Ham and eggs consist of either one monster slice of ham and three eggs potatoes and toast or pancakes of four smaller slices about the size of a small fist. The omelet&#39;s are bigger and the skillet is ridiculously large with four eggs prepared the way you like &#39;em and sitting on top of a large plate of potatoes and whatever else you want on it, Denver, meat lovers etc. Very busy on the weekends.

I do intend on giving it another try but I def will order something different. I had the pepper and egg on an English muffin. It was so tasteless!!

 the chicken rice soup was really good too. My husband had the southwest omelette. It was a little more tasty. We will return to try something else.

The prompt, amicable service has not changed and the portions are ridiculous for the money you slap down on the table.

They also serve up a greek omelet that actually has gyro meat in it! Nice touch as too many places skimp on with veggies only... what gives? :)

Reliable breakfast for your average greasy spoon diner. My only regret is that the strip mall location doesn&#39;t help the decibel level all that much. One of the waitresses seems to barks orders at the clientele and kitchen staff in a loud voice that sounds as if someone dumped an ashtray down her throat... Not too appealing."

Randomly found this place and glad I did. Didn&#39;t look at the menu and took the waitresses advice and went with the ham and egg skillet; and had it to go. 

A guy who seemed to be the owner handed me my meal all wrapped up, and food unseen. He asked me &#34;if I was ready for this,&#34; and picking up the food, and feeling the weight, I knew I was in for a teat. 

I drive a few blocks but had to stop to see this what I got. Smelled to go to go any longer. Took it out and was amazed at the portion size and it was sooo good. 

I don&#39;t live anywhere near buffalo grove, but will definitely have to come back to dine in."

We (me, wifey and the kids) went for breakfast on Sunday morning around 10:30, pretty much peak time. Waited literally 4 minutes for a table to open up.

I will start by saying we (I) will definitely come back to this place, it fits my preferences very well.  It&#39;s nothing fancy by looking at it, at Mr. Allisons it is more about function and overall value than interior design and commercialism.

Our waitress was polite and friendly to the kids, with a smile pretty much the whole time. Filled our Iced tea and coffee without us having to ask for more our whole visit.

I ordered the 3 eggs, hash browns, large ham and toast.  For 7.50 this is a great bargain.   For 7.50 this is a great bargain.  Absolutely worth saying twice!  The ham was about 3/4 inch thick and about the size of a large pancake, no kidding I was cutting it with my fork it was so tender and not too salty, maybe the best ham I have had for breakfast to date..

My kids split the french toast meal (3 french toast, 3 eggs, large ham), about 7.00, this included the lesser quality ham (waitress explained there are two types) this one is still good, but more cured taste and a bit chewier. The French toast was really good as well and thick. The portion sizes were GREAT, 2 kids split this meal and we brought home leftovers. 

The downside, there had to be one....  my wife&#39;s Spinach Feta omelet was mediocre at best, spinach was very dark colored and almost no feta, could see little pieces in there, but if you were blindfolded you would&#39;ve thought they forgot to put it in.

Also the hash browns are normal shredded potatoes (nothing special), thrown on the grill, next time I would ask for them crispy, all these places never brown them enough IMO..

These two issues are not a deal breaker in any way, I think next time we will stay away from the omelets, stick with the Ham.  all in all, including tax and 20% tip we got outta there under 36.00.  Not too shabby for four hungry folks bringing home yummy leftovers.

Good place, give this place a shot, and be sure to try the premium ham (it&#39;s not clearly explained on the menu, so ask which is which)

I almost forgot, the have a VERY affordable kids menu (so rare these days) with 4-5 choices under 4 dollars, some were under 3 as well.

Also, they don&#39;t accept Discover, but they do take Visa/Mastercard.

Later Folks!"

I&#39;m a big breakfast food fan so it didn&#39;t take me long after bookmarking it to get my ass to Mr. A&#39;s.

We arrived a little after 10 am on a Sunday morning to find a line already snaking out the door. After shivering for about 5 minutes in the wind, we made an inquiry about a couple of empty bar seats and were immediately seated before the massive crowd. Score.

I guess most people know exactly what to order before even stepping foot inside the place because we weren&#39;t even seated before being asked by a hyperactive waitress what we would like to order with a pen and pad in her hand. I laughed in disbelief and asked for just a few moments.

We ended up ordering the #1 combo, which is the king sized ham, three eggs, and potatoes and a western omelette. Within 5 minutes our food was in front of us and we couldn&#39;t believe the massive proportions. I&#39;m a sucker for quantity especially if it tastes good. 

If you want interesting entertainment, sit at the bar and watch the ladies bicker with each other. This show was non-stop and went on throughout our entire meal and the guy next to me and I had good time making fun of them. Lots of thrown dishes, eye rolling, mutterings underneath breaths, evil eyes when backs are turned... you name, they were doing it all in front of us. Some may say that this is unprofessional and it is but I could care less as long as they don&#39;t give me attitude. For me, it was cheap, live entertainment.

I must warn the snobby crowd that this is no place for dainty fruit slices and superfluous garnishes served with gourmet coffee. This is good ol&#39; honest greasy spoon breakfast diner food served fast, hot, and in immense proportions. There are many places that can do this fairly well but Mr. A&#39;s  has a superb ham to boast and it is the ham that I saw on almost every plate that was being served. 

I&#39;m not usually a ham fan but Mr. A&#39;s ham really is something special. We could not get over how tender and juicy this extra thick slice of ham was. My four egg, yes 4 egg, omelette was gargantuan and contained copious amounts of chunky ham literally slathered in artery clogging gooey American cheese. Needless to say, I was swooning and happier than a pig covered in sh*t. The only complaint, or rather observation, I have is that the omelette is more of a filling wrap constructed of a lot of egg. I&#39;m used to the ingredients being integrated with the egg but I suspect that the size of the ham chunks they use don&#39;t agree very well with this construction method. It&#39;s a different style and still tastes great, just not what I&#39;m used to but I have no problem dealing with it.

Mr. A does not skimp on the potatoes and I appreciate that. Not only are potatoes cheap, potatoes tastes great, fill up the plate, and add perceived value. I never understood why other breakfast restaurants feel the need to skimp on something that costs them so little and can make a customer so happy. I feel that other breakfast diners really need to learn a lesson from Mr. A and start serving larger potato portions with their meals out of common sense.

Needless to say, I have found my new favorite breakfast spot. I&#39;ve also found  a love for ham that I never really had before. I&#39;ll be back every chance I get."

When &#34;Chicago&#39;s Best&#34; gets out to my neck of the woods, I feel obligated to go check the place out myself.

What I was most interested in was the ham.  On the show, they spent a lot of time reviewing the ham.  Apparently it&#39;s all done (cured, smoked, baked, whatever) in-house.

My son and I ordered the No 1, 3 eggs, slab of ham, hash browns and toast.
All for just over $7.00.
When our order arrived, plates covered the table.

First off, the ham was extremely good.  A bit on the salty side, but it&#39;s ham, so no complaints.  It was tender, juicy and very flavorful.
The 3 eggs were done perfectly at over easy.
While the hashbrowns were tasty, I just couldn&#39;t clean my plate.
After 3 eggs and a delectable slab of ham, it was a bit tough to try to squeeze any more in.

For under $20 with tip, we were both well fed with really solid, good food.

We will definitely be back to try the pancakes, french toast etc..
I&#39;m sure, all with a slab of ham on the side.."

this is working class food, food for parsimonious seniors and those not taken to gourmet foods or defining themselves as &#34;foodies&#34;.

i had a tuna salad sandwich with &#34;american fries&#34;. now ,when i read american fries i am usually thinking of those upscale replacements for potato clippings (also know as hash browns). but these were simple french fries and i realized this might have been a throwback to a decision by some restaurants to punish the french for some political infraction in the past.

the sandwich was big and pretty good, served on &#34;greek bread&#34; which was to my eyes, simply thick white bread. the fries were average. my friend was not too blown away by her burger. 

the portions were big, the prices very reasonable, the waitress was a character and the place had an unpretentious attitude you see less and less these days. no theme is needed in these greasy spoons. its quick cheap and certainly not bad. 

in all fairness, mr a&#39;s is all about the ham, which is not a favorite of mine. not a bad place but with the chicago area having so many selections im pretty sure i would not return."

I never have really had much positive experience with Vietnamese food as I sometimes found that it was too salty for my liking. While visiting family in the city, they suggested this as one of their favorite places for great Pho. The quaint little restaurant seats about 25 but while we were eating there were never less than ten people waiting for a seat.

Knowing that I didn&#39;t particularly like beef broth, I tried the Pho listed with chicken instead. That was the moment I realized I could get behind all the Pho game. The portions were delicious and very filling.

I was lucky to be able to also try the fried shrimp egg rolls which were delicious, crunchy, and moist. Everything you want from an egg roll without having to drown it in sauce.

Get there quickly and eat there often!"

They are legit, authentic, the real deal! I had the Bánh mì and the Pho with all the different types of meats (had to try them all to see which I would order exclusively next time) but after trying them all I would order this exact style again (it had steak, brisket, meatball, and other delicious cuts of meat) 

But don&#39;t let me forget about that sandwich!! Now I&#39;m Mexican and we have legendary sandwiches called tortas but these rank just as high! They are absolutely delicious,i had the house specialty with all the trimmings and it was the highlight of the visit. 

Only bad part was that the sprite I ordered tasted funny, I initially thought it was the Sprite but after sipping some straight from the can as opposed to from the iced cup they gave me i realized it was either the cup or ice (most likely the ice) that had an off taste to it. Either way I hardly noticed, I&#39;m coming back here without a doubt (might turn into a regular)"

Dirty dishes left on tables long after people have left.  These should be removed from table before check is even presented.

Ordered a water and and iced tea, received something that looked like 20% iced tea mixed with water. No thanks.  Tried to send it back - was ignored. 

No one came to table at all after food was delivered... not to check on us - or refill the water for those that actually received clear water, not to clear dirty dished or present check. Nothing.

Mediocre food and dirty interior and truly horrible sercice.  Staff looked like zombies.  No expressions - blank eyes.

They did make an off - menu vegan stir fry for dining companion.  Bland as it was - he was happy to be accommodated."

I always get excited when I introduce my people&#39;s food to others because I honestly believe Vietnamese food is one of the best out there. 

Because we got there at 12:15, there was a wait for the table. The restaurant is pretty small so we were consistently in the way. When we were seated, we waited a little for someone to take our order.

I got the grilled marinated pork banh mi. It was amazing. You have a warm toasty french roll stuffed with pickled dichon radish and carrots. Then, chopped sweet pork layered in the bun. To top it off, I got sliced jalapeños and cilantro. This is a winning combination. It&#39;s light and healthy, and even the pickiest eaters would love a banh mi.

I have a few minor issues with the place. I think service was a little slow and the waiter must have had a bad day because he definitely write a stinky face. Also, the interior looked a bit old and dirty. This didn&#39;t negate the food though. The food was a total win for me."

I have been feeling under the weather so my boyfriend suggested we get soup. And then he&#39;s like let&#39;s try that soup you told me about before which was pho. 

We started off with shrimp egg rolls. They were perfectly crispy and delicious! You can tell they change the oil here which is always a good thing. 

We each ordered the beef pho #7 I think is the one we ordered. It was so delicious. Basically if you&#39;re in the area and need/want pho in your life make sure you stop here. I promise you will not be disappointed."

Banh mis are cheap &amp; also good, I just prefer more meat to bread ratio so next time I&#39;d order with extra meat. 

But I recently tried their avocado bubble tea, and it was the worst I&#39;ve ever had. The tapioca bubbles weren&#39;t cooked enough so the insides were hard and not chewy. Service was avg, not bad, but not good. Interior needs remodeling. For those reasons, I&#39;m not sure how often I&#39;d make the drive to eat here in 2016, but I think I would next time I get a craving for their cornish hen."

Came here for dinner last night. When I walked in the door, all my senses were shooting red flags at me. Inside looked like someone&#39;s old dirty living room; smelled like they were cooking dog food &amp; rotten vegetables.

Something told me to turn around &amp; walk out the door but I&#39;ve been in plenty of places that looked &amp; smelled terrible but had AWESOME food so I figured this could be another one, based on all the previous yelp reviews I looked at.

I got the seasoned pork with rice noodles. The pork had a very interesting &amp; hard to describe flavor (not good); the noodles were cold. The portion size of the pork was a bit skimpy so I had to stretch it. The pork and noodles were layed on a bed of lettuce. Part of the lettuce tasted like mint leaves which gave the meal a not to be desired taste. It came with a strange red sauce on the side. I was going to put it on the dish but fortunately I smelled it and it had a repugnant smell to it.

Maybe I just don&#39;t like Vietnamese food. I&#39;m willing to try it again if I find another spot because I&#39;ve tried and love food from tons of different cultures. The staff was nice but needless to say, I have no intentions on returning here."

I ordered the Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodles) and it was really yummy. I enjoyed it because they provided a full platter of fresh veggies and the broth was perfection. I also ordered a banh mi (viet sandwich) to go so I can eat later and that was yummy, too. My total for the BBH &amp; banh mi was about $15 after tax and tip.

My friends got the rice platters and one enjoyed it while the other one thought it was just okay. I would definitely come back for the BBH. The bowl is huge so make sure you&#39;re super hungry!"

We passed by this place while driving down the street.  We weren&#39;t even sure if they were open.  Luckily my Yelp app changed my mind!

The food here is delicious and inexpensive.  The hubs had a mango smoothie and I had hot tea.  We started with spring rolls.  Excellent peanut sauce.  I could had a whole bowl of it.  The hubs ordered a meal that we could not pronounce even after asking the server.  It was lettuce, rice noodles, veggies, some little eggroll looking things.  He said it was fantastic.  I had the standard sliced beef pho.  So delicious and soothing for my hangover.

As with a lot of delicious Asian places, this is no frills dining.  There is a server who takes your order and brings food but it isn&#39;t a place that fills your glass after every sip of water.  The dining room is a room for dining.  A few pieces of art on the wall.  There is no bar or alcohol.  Just good food.

I would say this place is authentic; the dining room was packed and we were the only white people....besides one man who was dining with other Asian people.  I sometimes have my doubts about an Asian place if there are no Asian customers.

We will definitely be back.  I am not sure how I can survive without more peanut sauce."

Decor is simple, but sufficient - prices are reasonable for Vietnamese in the suburbs and menu is pretty much all standard Vietnamese items (doesn&#39;t venture into Thai, Chinese, or other items). 

The food is relatively flavorful with simple flavor combinations. It&#39;s not the best Vietnamese I&#39;ve ever had (I love extremely fresh ingredients and meat that is a little on the fattier side if in a soup and with more char if it&#39;s in a noodle salad). But it&#39;s nice if you&#39;re passing by and want well prepared Vietnamese food. The portion sizes are respectable, mostly full bowl for a bun and pho, with a decent amount of meat.

We ordered a Pho Dat Biet and Cum Bo Luc Lac. The broth and the over experience of the Pho dish was good - the broth seemed very clean and their portions of meats were generous (although there are other places that are more generous). The Cum Bo Lac Lac was a good sized plate - a lot of vegetables though. The amount of beef in that plate was less than what we had both anticipated. It wasn&#39;t too greasy or oily from the cooking. The wait time for sitting down and being served was a bit long - if we didn&#39;t have to wait so long I think our experience would have been better.

Today was the last straw. I ordered some food. Couple pho, sandwiches and spring rolls. I specifically ordered veggie spring rolls, because my girlfriend is vegan, and having them mess this up before I said veggie only spring roll.. I get home and there is both pork and shrimp.

The walls have brown splash marks on them.  Their food is good but what is the point of eating it when you feel filthy during your meal and feel like you need to take a shower right when you get home?  This is especially after seeing the staff member leave the bathroom with his purple kitchen gloves still on.  I am sorry to say but I cannot dine here anymore.  I would rather pay more money for a cleaner establishment."

By far the best soups and Vietnamese Pho I have found in the suburbs.  You can choose either egg or rice noodles or a combo.  Served with plenty of cilantro, basil, sprouts and peppers.  I am a &#34;foodie&#34; and I promise you this place won&#39;t disappoint.   The tamarind fried wings are a must with flash fried shallots or garlic on them.  Sweet, crispy, flavorful delight!   Other dishes are wonderful and I highly recommend an avocado smoothy with black tapioca balls.  Sounds out there but a great way to finish it off.  I&#39;d give it five stars for the food but it is a small dive in a strip mall so I reduced it to four stars.  This place is fantastic cheap eats and thanks to my brother Dave for hooking me up up to this place.  Definitely try it out."

Dropped in for lunch and got a large bowl of Pho.  Service was great and while I am no giant connoisseur of Pho; what I got was very tasty once I got the spice level to my liking.  The people that work there were extremely attentive and very polite.

A couple of guys behind me got some sandwiches which looked fantastic.  May have to get that next time.  

All in all a great lunch spot.  Solid 4 stars."

It&#39;s funny because Yelp and it&#39;s infamous Yelpers rarely lead me astray, but I just must not get this place because I was so disappointed after my visit. 

I stopped in on a Friday evening with my sister after jealously watching check-in after check-in on my Yelp feed. Parking was next to impossible which I took as a good sign. I walked in and found that my sister had snagged a table. Awesome!

I am a pho newbie and I wasn&#39;t sure what to order. Our server was of absolutely no assistance so we had an appetizer of some egg rolls and I orderef a chicken banh mi. The pho made me nervous since I wasn&#39;t sure where to start. Kinda thinking I should have jumped in head first and tried it anyway. The egg rolls were awful. Old. Chewy. Lukewarm. Generally unacceptable. I got a little nervous about my sandwich.

The chicken banh mi was definitely better than the egg rolls but not something I would rush back for anytime soon. The chicken was fresh, but lacked any real seasoning. The roll was crusty and made a mess all over my shirt. 

The service was lackluster which would almost be okay in a casual place like this, but add on top of that that it was sticky and fairly dirty everywhere and I just can&#39;t get on this bandwagon. I&#39;m not a snob (I do love a good dive) and I&#39;ll try almost anything once. Pho Ha, you&#39;re just not for me."

Price points are great, and the food is really good too. They are generally really busy during lunch hours so I try to go a little later. I love that they have the build your own pho so you can pick what kind of meats you want or don&#39;t want in it. 

There are a few down falls, one is that the staff is not very interested in their customers. And they close early quite a bit and it&#39;s not like 5 minutes, I&#39;ve been there at 20 minutes before their closing time and been turned back.

At first sight you can tell place is not truly clean and spotless, this appears to be accumulated dirt and not just busy evening one.
 So we have to wait for few minutes for a table, at this point I see a server of some sort wondering around the place, her appearance is far from professional and hygienic.
On top of that of that she has serious attitude problem,being short and rude with customers. We get the table and order the food, in all honesty it is tasty and good but within few minutes we see the staff picking up dishes into a rolling cart with containers so dirty it made me gag .

I&#39;ve been slurping up that beefy goodness for 10+ years folks, and it just keeps getting better and better with every visit. Perfect consomme takes practice, and practice makes perfect, and if this pho isn&#39;t at or near perfection, well, I can&#39;t even imagine, because I think I really might pass out from the pleasure of my imagination.

It is by far the best Pho restaurant I&#39;ve been to in a while.  I understand this to be a mom and pop&#39;s restaurant so there is nothing fancy or glitzy about it.  But, for me , that&#39;s okay.  I don&#39;t eat in the restaurant so I don&#39;t know the condition of the tables, chairs, etc.  However, I will judge it by the food and my interaction with the staff.  Here is what I came with:
*  If you&#39;re ok with mediocre customer service and provides awesome food, this is the place for you.  
*  If you&#39;re okay with straight forward, give your order with no fluff but the food comes out great, this is the place to go.  
*  If you&#39;re okay with the cashier not smiling at you, being nice and friendly, but provide food that feels like home then come on over.

From Pho to rice dish and to the noodles, I found the food very satisfying to my pallet and I would come here over and over again.  I just have to be more open minded when coming here and know that I&#39;m getting good food and to just ignore the poor customer service.  

My star rating consist of 4 stars for the food and 1 star for customer service.  Although, I feel very bad giving this restaurant this review because my last review for another restaurant that gave me inadequate customer service I did not give a pleasant review and was very harsh with my words.  So, with that said, customer service is very important in any restaurant business.  If you find a Pho restaurant that has great food and gives awesome customer service, I&#39;m open for suggestions."

My first visit I got the Pho tai bo vien (beef flanks and meet balls) and this time I got the mi/hu tieu (egg noodle/rice noodle soup). Both dishes did have a body of flavor and portion sizes were decent enough to fill you up. The pho was tastey on it&#39;s own without sirracha or hoisin sauce. From my experience, traditionally the Vietnamese version of hu tieu is tastier with fish sauce, lemon, and chili (all of which was accessible). Pho Ha would be recommended if you cannot get into the city to get your pho or Vietnamese food fix. 

This visit was during a huge rush for the New Year and I assume that the staff did not expect the volume of patrons towards the end of the night. There is no wait system, no reservation system, and you are to awlwardly stand and wait your turn without any aknowledgement from the staff. Even after our meal while paying, we received terrible attitude from one of the young employees. I would rate the service as a flat 1 star or no stars at all but the food quality and taste makes up for the lack of service."

Lots of people from all backgrounds come there, and there are enough Viets who come, so the place must be legit :)  

The service is typical for an Asian restaurant - just flag someone down and they&#39;ll come help you.  Don&#39;t expect it to be your American restaurant service with your one server coming back every 5 minutes to ask you how you&#39;re doing :)  The service is actually better than many Viet places I&#39;ve been to, because most of the staff is younger and speaks good English.  

As for other dishes... Their Banh Canh is really good.  The Bun Mam was not great.

I got the Beef noodle soup with all the trimmings, duh. The broth was phenomenal....perfect for a cold day. Beef ball, tripe, tendon, rare beef, etc...all was spot on! Fresh sprouts, basil, jalepenos, and the Hoisin/Sriracha just killed it....in a good way.

Although I can&#39;t remember the meatballs as good as the beef..

The reason why I knocked off two stars, the place is small (not the owners fault) where other hungry customers hover next to your table and make you feel rushed and uncomfortable. Back off. I was under the assumption when walking in initially that you are seated by a host, but that is not the case. You seat yourself. Also, The waitress never checked in with me once to see how my food was. My water was never filled, it was more than half empty, and the waiter never came around until the very end, and still not fill it. And getting the bill was a chore in itself. I sat about 10 minutes with an empty bowl on my table waiting for someone to come by. Only when a man had to clear a couple of tables for a large group that came in, then he saw me sitting there waiting.

I wish I could have rated it higher. I only tried one dish on the menu and found it to be superb. The service was awful though. But I&#39;d definitely go back for the food alone and try the other dishes my fellow yelpers recommended"

Bold words since Viet Town is 30 miles from this place but it&#39;s no joke. With pho, it&#39;s all about the broth and Pho Ha&#39;s is number one - pho real. 

To start, the broth is a true consommé which is clear and flavorful. It requires additional steps and takes a lot of time but at Pho Ha, it&#39;s done perfectly right. Once you taste it, you&#39;ll be taken away by the intensity of flavor. The broth has a clean flavor that isn&#39;t oily at all. At some places, you&#39;ll see oil on the surface of the broth which isn&#39;t appetizing. 

There are also other items on the menu that don&#39;t require broth and are my favorite dishes to order. My favorite is the egg noodle with shrimp, BBQ pork, and fish cake. I order this dry with soup on the side - it&#39;s similar to a traditional Thai bamee dish that I would eat in Thailand. 

Don&#39;t forget the spring rolls and bahn mi sandwiches. The spring rolls always taste fresh and come with a peanut sauce for dipping. There is a limited selection of bahn mi sandwiches but for only $3, I end up getting two anyways. 

The prices are inexpensive and for the quality, you will keep coming back for more - pho sure."

It&#39;s really small and tight, but the turnover was really fast. We waited about 10 minutes on a busy Sunday afternoon, around 1pm.

I got the Pho with sliced beef and brisket (25), and it was tender and savory. This place is one of the few that serve mint in addition to basil, sprouts, lime, jalapeños, and cabbage. All the great sauces are on the table.

My wife got the Special Vietnamese broth with pork, fish, shrimp, and eggplant (41). It had a flavor that I had never experienced before, yet seemed vaguely familiar. Delicious, but definitely meant for seafood lovers like my wife and me.

There was also a special menu and we ordered the tamarind chicken wings. These are a must try! They offered to make them spicy, but we opted to have the spice on the side so we could share with our son. Next time we&#39;ll do it with the spice full on!

Prices here are reasonable, but I would be happier if they went down by a dollar or two. Still the price is not going to stop me from coming back, and trying more of the menu!"

It&#39;s ridiculous how some places way overcharge for bahn mi nowadays (here&#39;s looking at you, Saigon Sisters) but this place does right and delivers a fresh and filling sandwich for right around $4-5. Can&#39;t beat prices like that. I had the grilled pork bahn mi and it was excellent. The pork was a little too chewy at times but the amazing bread made up for it. It was warm and fresh and soft and everything you could ask for in terms of great bread. 

I topped it off with a watermelon bubble tea which was super refreshing and very sweet. One thing to be aware of is they have a minimum charge of $15 in order to use a credit card, so make sure to have some cash on hand before coming by!"

The atmsophere here is lacking. It&#39;s in a strip mall and is not so attractive. The plastic tables are very close together and everything seems a bit sticky.

However, the husband loves the food.  We got spring rolls, which were quite delicious with the peanut sauce they provided. I got a 29, which I think was pho with steak.  It was tasty, if not a bit bland. I added sauce to mine, along with all the sides it came with.

The next morning, I posted a very sweet 5K PR, which I&#39;m attributing to the combo of salty broth and carby noodles. I will be back, simply because I&#39;m superstitious about my running races."

Times are a little different now with a little one so I mostly take my Pho to go. Service is always nice, the orders are always prompt and the price is always right. 

My faves: 
Pho Tai--beef noodle soup with slice beef steak. The broth is always fragrant and flavorful, and the beef is always fresh. Accompanied by a lot of fresh bean sprouts, basil and jalepeno. Add the Siracha of course and it&#39;s even more magical.
Goi Cuon--fresh springrolls with shrimp, pork and veggies.  Very fresh, well-wrapped. totally delicious.They must know me now because whenever I order they always give me one small container of delicious peanut sauce PER springroll. I LOVE that sauce.

And a new fave: 
Com Tam Suon Nuong--Grilled marinated pork chop served with rice. I love their rice, it&#39;s totally home spun asian style, like how my relatives cook it in the Philippines. it&#39;s not fluffy Uncle Bens type or sticky rice. I can&#39;t really explain it, it just reminds me of visiting the Philippines. The pork is very tender and so tasty. This is what my son will eat so I will order it every time and it&#39;s consistently good."

Let&#39;s be real though, I have a real thing for ethnic food of all kinds.  It just so happened, this week was my first encounter with Vietnamese.

So, Cristie B. and I have been *trying* to plan a dinner for, legit, months now, and it FINALLY happened at Pho Ha on Tuesday.  The weather was damn cold and shitty, so something warm and comforting sounded just perfect (without breaking the calorie budget.)  Cristie suggested Pho, and I was all over it.

As mentioned in previous reviews:
1) yes, its very small inside.  There were maybe six tables?  When I arrived at 5:15 a few were open, but when we left just after 7, they were packed.
2) sure, it&#39;s a little divey/dingey.  These places generally, in my experience, have the most authentic food.
3) yeah, the service wasn&#39;t terribly attentive, but, only *after* the food came.  We were offered beverages and to order right away, and the food came out hot and fast.

So, what did I eat?  #25 - Pho with sliced beef and brisket.  Also, #2, Vietnamese spring rolls with pork and shrimp.

Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING I shoveled into my pie hole that night was glorious.  The peanut sauce at this joint is TO DIE.  The spring rolls were fresh and stuffed with awesome, fresh flavors.  PHO?  OMG.  When Cristie told me that this was miracle soup, she wasn&#39;t kidding.  I jazzed mine up with a TON of beansprouts, thai basil, and let a slice of jalapeno sit in there for a bit... perfect.  The broth wasn&#39;t greasy, it was clean and deep with flavor.  The noodles were perfect for slurping, I make not excuses for the noises I made while eating.  I ordered a &#34;small&#34; bowl (a large is only 50 cents more, by the way) and had enough leftover to take for lunch the next day.

AAAND, to top it off... my dinner, including tip, cost thirteen dollars.  That&#39;s insane.

You can bet that I&#39;ll be back at Pho Ha soon, and looking for Pho closer to my house!"

Not having eaten Vietnamese food before visiting this restaurant, I went in to this experience with an open mind. I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. I had only read one or two of the reviews on Yelp and I had heard from people personally that this was a place to def try. 

I had seen some photos of their dishes on Yelp that looked delicious and my sister agreed to check this out with me on an evening we had some time for a quick meal. 

At first, I walked in and was invited to sit whereever I chose. My sis hadn&#39;t shown up yet, so I picked a table in the corner. The first thing I noticed was the table and the items on the table were dirty. Everything was on a food tray that had food, salt and pepper all settled on it. It was dirty and need to be cleaned. The floor had on it and not just a little crumb...I&#39;m talking about a full piece of lettuce and a cucumber and some noodles. It was gross. Why hasn&#39;t anyone cleaned this stuff up? But ok, so many people say this place is excellent, so I&#39;m thinking the food will be their saving grace. 

We ordered the egg rolls to start. They were chewy; almost as if they were not fresh. I think they may have been fried twice. Damn it! I wanted to like this place! But wait, let&#39;s see how our meals are.

I tried the cornish hen and I have to say the flavor WAS there. I can see the appeal. But it was greasy!

I tried my sister&#39;s sandwich and again it was good but there wasn&#39;t much meat. (disappointed sigh)

I couldn&#39;t wait to leave but I had to use the restroom before departing. Funnily enough, the bathroom was cleaner than the dining room.  Now I&#39;m just done. Let&#39;s roll!

Not returning."

The menus are revamped and look so simple and pretty. I love the pho. The prices never change and is reasonable. I will always come back and tell people to come here in the future.

Only difference is, I&#39;ve conditioned myself, having eating pho with such insatiable gusto all these years.

Spring rolls - how can you mess these up?!

Beef and meatball pho (I like this combo but you&#39;ll have to ask for it because for whatever reason it isn&#39;t a listed option) - textbook perfect, with rich, spicy broth, lean shavings of beef, and fat, juicy slices of meatball.

Chicken pho - The simpler broth is so comforting, but I&#39;m knocking my rating down a star because of giant pieces of chicken with skin and gristle still clinging on. 

The bountiful veggies snap with freshness, and there&#39;s even that sawleaf coriander that I cannot get enough of. SCORE."

I ordered a special off the menu which was a Crepe with chicken and a side of veggies. My hubby had the Tamarind Wings which were also very good.

This is the place to go! They have a wide varieties of Pho (noodle soup), to Banh Mi (sandwiches), to Com Gia (rice dishes)!

The Pho is very tasty and flavorful, has a generous amount of noodles and meat (beef slices, beef flanks), among other things. I love getting it during the winter because its warms you up during those cold days.

The Com Ga (fried baby hen with white rice and a side of broth) is to die for! The baby hen is marinated overnight then its deep fried and all the seasoning is soaked into  the meat. This is one of my favorite dish because its extra crispy and flavorful.

The Com Ba Luc Lac (diced marinated beef with green and red peppers and onions, and side of broth with thinly sliced onions) is one of my friend&#39;s favorite because this also has a lot of flavor and the beef is cook to perfection.

Now on to the sandwiches, the bread is warm and crispy when it&#39;s served. The selection is vast. You can get chicken, grilled pork, or various meat. I highly recommend them.

Overall, I&#39;ve never had a bad experience and I haven&#39;t been there enough to try everything, but I greatly recommend this place and the price is cheap! You can get an entire meal for under $10!"

I love the flavor. But in my opinion, the portion is too big, especially when you are trying other stuff. 

The wings have enough to spice to last on your lips well after you have finished eating. 

The three items cost about $18.  I would recommend stopping by, but suggest you order much less than I did."

I usually cannot finish it.

The RICE WITH SIZZLING BEEF is awesome.  It comes with beef cubes in delicious dark sauce, bell peppers, onion, cucumbers and a side of clear soup.  

The service is pretty fast, but you may have to wait for a table if you come during peak hours.

I can&#39;t recall the exact name if the dish I got but it was a noodle soup that was hot and spicy with beef and that was it. At first bite, I thought that I should have gotten something else because it was very got temperature wise which didn&#39;t help the already hot and and spicy flavor.

It&#39;s a small place in a strip mall - definitely not a place you would think would have great food. But my friend Crisitie B. swears by it. So we went. First off, their smoothies are amazing. The watermelon smoothie with tapioca is literally addicting. I have been craving it ever day since. Their spring rolls are pretty much to die for - the peanut sauce they serve is exceptional. And their Pho is great. I didn&#39;t really even know what Pho was, but they have a nice variety to choose from. Some on the safer side (some with tenderloin or meatbaslls), others with tendons. 

Whatever you feel comfortable with. the only bad part was I felt that the service was lacking. We had probably 4 different people serve us, and I felt like we waited a while sometimes to be served.

This place is a hidden gem. Really small, but it gives it a homey, cozy vibe. The service is great - really fast, friendly, and attentive.

The food is out of this world. My favorite is the beef pho with all the trimmings. The broth has a super rich flavor, and tastes like the real deal - not that sodium-laced crap you get at other places. The noodles are perfectly slurp-able and the meat is tender and VERY clean. A lot of times with organ meats people complain about the &#34;earthy&#34; flavor, but this stuff is as good as it gets. The add-ins are very fresh: bean sprouts, basil, hot peppers, and a great variety of sauces.

The bubble teas (more like smoothies or slushies, for those of you who aren&#39;t familiar) with tapioca beads are AWESOME.

Prices are fair, and the menu has a lot of other selections: appetizers, soups, noodle dishes, rice dishes, entrees, desserts, coffee and tea drinks.

Argyle pho in the &#39;burbs. Since discovering this place it has become a frequent destination when craving pho. The price is comparable to Chicago for pho 8 dollars for large and 7.50 for small for the combo pho. Orders are quickly taken and the pho comes out pipping hot. The broth has a slight sweet taste that is balanced with all of the other flavors. A good healthy portion of noodles with proteins rounds out the dish. You also get a plate of the thai basil, lime, jalapeno, and bean sprouts as well. Amazing summer and winter. The only down side is that the place is small and sort of hole in the wall. For my pho craving, i&#39;ll be back!

pho-ha-glendale-heights,Cristie F.,d-KWUwwt9jGmuIBG5pyP0w,"Roselle, IL",0,1,1,414,22,kuwLH8uHFdmrZVVKZ3zeJQ,5.0,2012-02-07,"&#34;Hi, my name is Cristie and I&#39;m a Pho-alholic.&#34; 

My very first experience with Vietnamese foods was at Pho Ha - a tiny, family owned and run restaurant hidden in a shady strip mall in Glendale Heights. Since then, I will admit, I have become somewhat of a pho junkie. I&#39;ve scoured the burbs for Vietnamese shops and sampled as many bowls of pho as I have been able to find. Hands down - Pho Ha is my absolute fave. I love pho like crack addict loves their crack - maybe worse. It&#39;s borderline embarrassing when I find myself there once (sometimes twice - sigh) a week. My bf and I have our regular &#34;Pho Friday&#34; date night....slurping up noodles, mounds of meat, tasty beef broth with lime, basil, jalapeno, and bean sprouts. If that isn&#39;t romantic, I don&#39;t know what is. 

Other than traditional pho, some other favorite dishes are...
*Goi Cuon (sans shrimp). Best in the area. Pho sho.
*Com Bo Luc Lac - Rice with sizzling, tender, diced beef. Swooooon.
*Bun Bo Xao - Rice noodles with marinated sliced beef, lettuce, cucumber, and a plethora of other veggies. I also recommend throwing on some peanut sauce for fun.
*Bahn Mi Ga - Shredded chicken sandwich. The banh mi is my most recent discovery - and quite possibly may become the newest addiction
*Bahn Mi Bo Kho - This the bf loves. Beef stew with a toasted baguette. The veggies and gravy are to die for. However, I can&#39;t get past the gelatinous chunks on the meat. My stomach can&#39;t handle it. 

The prices are phonomenal. A banh mi will cost you a whopping 3-4 bucks, and a monstrous bowl of pho will cost you about $7.00. The owners and staff are usually friendly and accommodating. It&#39;s not the best service I&#39;ve experienced, but they&#39;re always fast and always willing to help you.

There are a few downsides. 
*This is a carnivore haven. In my attempt to become primarily vegetarian, I would have had to give up Pho Ha (yeah, right). None of the dishes are vegetarian friendly. Bummer. 
*The place is pretty grimy. I just choose to look past it. 
*If you go during peak times, expect to wait - outside. The place is small and there&#39;s no room to wait inside unless you&#39;re planning on sitting on another patron&#39;s lap.
*Bizarre hours - They don&#39;t close on the hour...instead they close 15 minutes prior. And yes, they will turn you away if you show up at 8:45pm. 

If you&#39;re looking for stellar pho, hit up Pho Ha. You will find yourself wanting to order everything off the menu. Whatever you get, you won&#39;t be disappointed.  ((Hence the reason I find myself here so often. I find the need to have it all...true junkie style.))"

We are soup and salad and both were delicious, served quickly,  and the portion size was great. 

The resturannt was clean and well kept up. Wait staff was quickly busing tables and wiping them down.

Overall I was impressed and will be coming back."

I avoided it for the longest time because I thought it was just pasta with different marinara sauces, or beef stroganoff.  Maybe it used to be, but it&#39;s not anymore.  They have a wide variety of pasta dishes and salads.  I&#39;ve been their 3 or 4 times for lunch recently and every time I go I find something else good to try. If you think it&#39;s just a place with pasta and sauce dishes, stop and and check out their menu.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised."

Server brought the wrong meal to the table and set it down in front of my kid. Each table has a number from their order so how do you mess that up when the place is half empty?! I was grabbing drinks at the time and saw my kid picking at the food, eating chicken out of the bowl. Female server came back and asked if we ordered it and I said no, she quickly grabbed it off the table, walked around the divider and put it in front of some middle aged guy. I asked my kid where the number was, &#34;she just took it.&#34; So there we are waiting on our food with no number and finally it comes. Food was great, and after we started eating the kid tells me she was going to order the other stuff next time because &#34;that guys food was better.&#34; Horrified. Will eat at this chain again but never this location. Hire more adults and not so many negative attitude &#34;I don&#39;t give a shit&#34; teenagers! Or at least have a manager adult overlooking things!"

Noodles and company in general,  this location is pretty busy though. I and it to be extra spicy for my penne Rosa and the cashier was dismissive and said it would have to be put in the side because they are busy. . Even though adding it woke cooking would be faster then taking time to place it in a container. Rude employees make me not want to come back."

The noodles were cold, and the vegetables were cold and hard as if they hadn&#39;t been cooked. I usually do not complain or return food but it was unappetizing. The tan blonde garnisher/cashier was very accommodating and apologetic and had the cook remake it. She insisted I take a rice crispy treat for the trouble. Every restaurant makes mistakes, it&#39;s how those mistakes are handled that stands out in my eyes. I will be back to this noodles."

I wish Tulsa had one of these as there is something on the menu for everyone. You can take the menu and split it in thirds, one third Asian style, one third European and one third American style noodle dishes. You can mix and match sauces and proteins to get what you have a craving for. The best part tho is the big wedge of rice crispie treat you can buy for desert to top off a good meal."

I ordered online and went to pick up my lunch. I arrived 4 minutes early from my stated pickup time and I guess their system hadn&#39;t even sent my order through yet. It seemed like they were quite rushed to get my order made and to me, but it was almost too quick where they didn&#39;t bother to make the food well and as a result I got flat, greasy microwaved, then pan seared noodles. I am quite disappointed that my lunch wasn&#39;t as good as I was looking forward to. I have 3 stars bc I have been here before for other items and they weren&#39;t too terrible. Also, since it&#39;s a chain I know it can be decent (maybe just other locations)."

I love the variety.  I wasn&#39;t much of a fan of this place at first but I&#39;ve come around an is a place we do for dinner here and there.  I like the lighter selections here, it always seems to be a bit healthier even though it might not really be...okay especially not if it&#39;s a meatball sandwich...but how can I reist sometimes.  Nice place great staff!  Always nice and clean."

It&#39;s sort of like Teriaki Express but with a thai focus.  I ordered the Pad thai with chicken and made it extra spicy.  Flavor profile was good (although I had to add some extra siracha!) and it was really quick.  I really like the fact that I can have drink refills.  It seems like a healthy option compared to some other resturants and I will definitely come back.

This is the only location I have been to, its walking distance from where our new office and I love that too! 
got the veg med sandwich today, it was good but it needed more cheese and wasn&#39;t very filling, and i did get a side salad too... I really LOVE that Truffle mac and cheese-did I mention that? 
The staff here is very friendly, its clean and I love when they send me coupons sometimes now that I signed up for the noodle club! 
I might be a regular here...
they are doing this passport promo now so I was trying to get my passport stamped trying the sandwich...I think they want you to try all 4 categories... 
I did try the japanese noodles which were pretty good too!"

Some our favorites are: The Pad Thai, Penne Rosa, Pasta Fresca, and the Bacon Mac n Cheeseburger (yum!). Most of the dishes I have tried are full of flavor and are made fresh &amp; fast. The staff is really friendly too. Definitely worth it."
