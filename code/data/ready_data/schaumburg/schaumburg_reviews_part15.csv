This is the Chipotle I most frequent. Good thing too, &#39;cause they&#39;re speedy, friendly and patient, generous with the fillings, and clean.

I know its a (former McD&#39;s) chain, but their tortilla chips are the best: thin, lightly salted, hint of lime. And the guac?! Don&#39;t even get me started. Total love. 

I&#39;m a fan!"

Every time I eat here I feel like it doesn&#39;t taste like chipotle at all. Ate here yesterday it was awful. I swear if I was blindfolded and you asked me to guess what I was eating in a million years I would have NEVER guessed Chipotle. I&#39;m starting to think Chipotle just fell off. I use to love Chipotle. I could eat for breakfast lunch and dinner all in the same day, but now I barely want to eat at all. It&#39;s because I&#39;m comparing it to how chipotle use to taste. Im giving 2 star for chipotle standards. If I had no prior experience with Chipotle no was eating for the first time I would have given a 3. I will say that this particular location has been consistently bad. Even when I was in love with Chipotle. 
What&#39;s probably going to end up happening is a month or two will pass, and I will eat chipotle again. I won&#39;t give this location another chance though. I&#39;ve given like 10 already."

It&#39;s pretty much the same as any other Chipotle.  However, this particular branch is not the greatest.  I tend to come here often cuz it&#39;s close to work for lunch.  However, I noticed that they almost always skimp on the meat.  I order the carnitas burrito bowl.  In this location, they mound on the rice until the bowl is almost full.  They then just sprinkle meat on.  Usually not even a full scoop.  All other locations tend to give me twice the amount of meat than this location.  

This visit, they messed up even farther.  I was the first customer of the morning.  They took the covers off the meats, and they were clearly leftovers from the previous day.  The pork was darkened and dry, obviously she&#39;d like bad leftovers.  And there was only a tiny but left.   Then the server skimped on the cheese to make matters worse.  

I&#39;ve finally given up on coming to the Addison location. Never again."

I didn&#39;t love this location but I liked it because it was close to work. However the past two times I have gone literally today and two days ago for lunch there is a Hispanic older lady who seems to not understand the concept of can I have more. I don&#39;t know if it was after this new program that chipotle put on that now everyone is getting stingy with the condiments but seriously when I say more I mean I want another spoonful of it. This lady in particular who I had the same service from gave me 1/3 spoonful of tomatoes and I asked for more and she gave another third and I had asked for more to get one whole spoonful which I typically would get on a normal day. It was the same deal with the corn. It is frustrating for the customer who has specific ingredients that they love and want more up to not get that because of an employee who is being very stingy for something that is not even hers.

That is why I ended up at this Chipotle this week. My poor husband has been working seven days a week at up to eighteen hours a day. The man was hungry. I get an hour for lunch and I wanted to eat too. So, I ordered from Chipotle online, scheduled my pickup time and crossed my fingers. 

I arrived at the appointed time and found a parking spot right in front of the door. I ran in and straight to the cashier as directed. I noticed that this location seems to have a but less seating than other locations I&#39;ve been to, but this won&#39;t deter me from visiting again as I have never actually dined inside a Chipotle location. It transports well, so I always eat it somewhere else. Anyhow, I showed the cashier my ID, another gentleman grabbed my bagged order from an under the counter warming area and I was gone. Yep, amazingly fast and easy. The order was paid for online, they offered a receipt at the counter and I could t have been happier. Truth be told, I was happier. Ten minutes later when we opened up our food and it was exactly as ordered!

Plus, I received a phone call that afternoon directly from the store inquiring about my experience. Two thumbs up, Chipotle!  You made my marathon lunch hour quite easy."

The employees were all smiling and all friendly and pleasant.  No stress here.

The place was clean.  Really, really clean.  And I was not the first person there by a long shot.

The food was actually at the right temp.  The chicken (had a chicken burrito bowl) was hot, the tomatoes&#39; were room temp (not frozen like they often are at other Chipotles), the green sauce was the perfect heat.

Easy parking.  Next to Walmart and SAMs club.  Difficult to get into the parking lot because of the construction on the roads around here.  

4 stars, would be 5 if it was a mom and pop."

Tonight, I ordered a bowl with brown rice. They offered me a free beverage while I waited two minutes for brown rice. They threw out the scoop left.

I got the shredded beef rice bowl with toppings, including guac. Again, good. But it seemed bland to me. Like, the guacamole just tasted so bland. And the beef didn&#39;t have much flavor besides salt. I guess I just don&#39;t &#34;get&#34; Chipotle. But I digress. If you do like Chipotle, this place is a good bet.

They are always smiling considering this location is not the most convenient to get in and out of relative to the construction on the roads as well as timing of lights nearby.  

I was recently part of a catering order and they were great!  All of the items came clearly marked, they provided plenty of plates, napkins, utensils, chafing dishes, and the value was phenomenal.  They really want to be part of the local community rather than just being the local branch.  It seems easy to forget about them when you might stop by occasionally for a meal but they do a great job.  Overall, a place I would definitely recommend for a meal for one or for 100."

This review is strictly on the food.  The service and restaurant itself is fine but I&#39;ve spit out more pieces of steak from my burrito bowl than I&#39;ve chewed and that has never happened at any of my many other Chipotle visits at other locations.  It even tastes different.  The meat that is.... You know when you cook a steak at home and you question if you waited 1 day too long.  It&#39;s still safe and edible but the quality has definitely diminished due to it not being as fresh?  That&#39;s what I&#39;m tasting right now as I sit here with my very disappointing dinner.  As a pregnant lady... I can say we will eat pretty much anything when hungry but this is not making me or the baby very happy.   I can&#39;t imagine they use any other cut of steak that isn&#39;t used at the other locations.  Maybe it was the way it was cut?  Although that doesn&#39;t make up for it&#39;s old, meaty taste.  

I&#39;ll give it another go of course at this location.  It&#39;s on the newer side and maybe they just don&#39;t have the flow down yet.  

Happy to revise my review when they get it right cause it is Chipotle and you have to be up to par if you want to make it as a location."

Even when I was leaving, another customer commented about the doors being too heavy and hard to open. 

Now, I am not sure if something has changed in Chipotles&#39; standards but I ordered a steak fajita burrito and the steak they tried to serve was still bloody. The steak was being cooked fresh and they said they cooked it &#34;medium&#34; and if that was OK with me. I&#39;d rather not eat bloody meat so I said I would just have chicken instead. They offered to cook it a bit longer for me if I didn&#39;t mind waiting. I was also offered a free drink since I had to wait. Also, I don&#39;t get why they ask what type of beans I want. It is a fajita burrito (where you have the veggies in lieu of beans)...maybe something has changed where they offer beans on this type of burrito now?

I&#39;ve given it 3 visits (didn&#39;t want to go back after the first time but friends dragged me there) and will never go back to this dump. 

1st visit was bland

2nd visit. I was with a group of friends who knew the bartender that was working. She was very attentive to them and completely ignored me several times. I had to wait a 10 minutes before she took my drink order and another 10 minutes to get it. The place wasn&#39;t even packed. At the end of the night she gives all of us our bills and tells the three guys I&#39;m with that she was giving each of them a beer on the house and completely left me hanging even though it was I that got the terrible service.

3rd visit was even worse. I met up a friend for his cousin&#39;s birthday party. He was the odd man out so I thought I&#39;d swing by to keep him company. I sat next you the group in an adjacent table and asked the server (who took forever again!) if I personally could have a separate check because I 1. Didn&#39;t know any of those people and 2. Didn&#39;t have cash to throw in. She preceded to condescendingly tell me that I was with the group and couldn&#39;t be separate and I should get cash because they have a atm there. So I obliged, went to the atm, took out $20 only the machine didn&#39;t spit out money or a receipt: NOTHING! I checked my bank account with an app on my phone and the charge went through, I walked over to the server and explained the situation. She then said that it wasn&#39;t their machine and she couldn&#39;t do anything about it. I asked to speak to the manager who eventually ended up giving me $20. They then put an &#34;out of order&#34; sign on then ATM. The whole situation was uncomfortable and the server was super rude the rest of the time I was there. With such a shoddy establishment I was worried she would do something unsanitary to my drink. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t leave, I&#39;m an idiot for not.

I wouldn&#39;t come back here if you paid me.

There used to be a place that made fresh bagels there before this place was ever built. I want that place back! Bring back the bagels!"

There is nothing like a local bar to get a good burger. But a good burger is not all they have. Even though they changed from Solace 601 to 601 Bar and Grill, they kept some of their favorites. The soups are homemade, and you have to try the tortilla soup and the bisque. They have good wings, and you can&#39;t beat Taco Tuesday. They serve tacos for a buck, and they are pretty much the real deal. When you&#39;re in Addison, you have to compete with some real taquerias, so you&#39;d better have real tacos. These are good.

For beer, they have been limited to mostly American lager, and some Mexican lagers. They have had Spaten and Guiness on tap since opening, and there is always that bottle of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, my go-to beer at 601, but recently 601 has brought in some beer from Revolution Brewery in Chicago, and a Church Street Brewery in Itasca. It&#39;s nice seeing 601 get some variety.

I like to hang out at 601 to watch the Hawks or the Sox, get a burger or wings, and down a couple of beers. The staff is very nice, and the owners are friendly."

The food was mediocre, the service wasn&#39;t great, and the atmosphere was boring.

However, we ended up coming here really randomly for New Years, and we had a lot of fun. There was live music, a free appetizer bar, and a fun crowd. The average age is probably 35-50. The service was really great, and the drinks were exceptional. I don&#39;t know if this would be a &#34;regular&#34; place for me since it&#39;s not a younger crowd, but if you are looking for a good local &#34;towny&#34; bar with a chill atmosphere, this would be it."

Honestly, I don&#39;t see it, they must have done a major renovation. The owners decided that blue collar Addison needed more wings and fewer foofy restaurants in strip malls. So now it&#39;s got a big bar, lots of tables and high tops, and a dozen or more TVs. 

We were seated promptly next to a picture of the Stanley Cup-winning Blackhawks and the most popular people in the restaurant. Half a dozen or more people squeezed themselves in next to my husband just to say hello to them. And yes, on a Friday evening around 5:30 the bar was crowded with middle-age dudes on their fourth beer with no inside voice.

But 601 saved itself. Because the food was quite good and the service was excellent. The menu is heavy on burgers and wings, but also includes other sandwiches, pizza and a few entrees for giggles.

We started with nachos, which were very good chips, covered in beans and taco meat, slathered in convenience store cheese sauce and dotted with tomatoes, scallions and sour cream. Not bad, but would&#39;ve been better with real cheese and pico de gallo.

We both ordered burgers: I had the California burger (avocado, green chiles, jack cheese, hold the mayo); the husband had the pizza burger.

Pretzel buns are awesome. The burger patties were juicy and cooked well (but not well-done). And the toppings were mighty tasty. We also both had waffle fries, which were sufficiently good though not seriously outstanding.

Service was very, very good -- seemed like nobody walked by our table without grabbing a used napkin, refilling the water, asking how the food was or *something*. Extremely attentive and friendly.

I just wish for a few more booths (I only spotted one) and a few less loud-mouthed dudes..."

We asked to have the grilled fish and vegetables.  One person in our party asked for tartar sauce and by the time he received it, he needed more fish to go with it.  One set of bathrooms are not designated women or men because they are for both, however, they are not marked for either.  Confusing for first timers. The staff was very friendly.

No one was there to greet us, so we decided to seat ourselves at a table. After waiting a couple minutes, we grabbed some menus.  The menu looked good, and we both decided what we would order.  The problem was, we never saw a server.  The bar was very crowed and loud and the bartender was doing her best to take care of everyone at the bar.

My food finally came, I had ordered a veggie burger with cheddar cheese, added avocado, and fries as a side. The avocado was luckily on the side of the burger, so as soon as my plate was put down I spotted the gross, inedible addition to my burger with black streaks throughout it. That avocado shouldn&#39;t have still been in their kitchen, let alone placed by the chef on my plate and it astounds me that the server didn&#39;t even glance down at my plate as she was carrying it out because if she had, I would hope she&#39;d never serve something that disgusting to a customer. The icing on the cake, I proceeded to take a bite out of my &#34;veggie burger&#34; only to discover I was in fact served a TURKEY burger. And as someone who has strict dietary restrictions that prohibit her from eating meat, one could imagine how upset I was. The server was mildly apologetic. All around horrible experience."

He&#39;s a 9-foot-tall beast man with absolutely no indoor voice.  When he told a story the entire Chicago metropolitan area could hear.  Even Milwaukee would complain about the noise.  True story.

Well the newly christened 601 Bar and Grill is loaded with Bill Braskys and the guys who love drunkenly going on and on about Bill Brasky.

But first things first.  The food here is actually really good.  Their big thing is their burgers which are made with beef that&#39;s so fresh and juicy because Bill Brasky himself, birthed, raised, slaughtered, butchered, and ground the meat himself all in the course of 30 minutes.  You can pick your bun too, which includes the all-mighty pretzel roll, a roll so divine it instantly makes any burger better.  Why is it so divine?  Because Bill Brasky brought it into existence sole by thinking about it... right after he scissor kicked Angela Lansbury.

The other entrees of note include all sorts of sandwiches, chicken, and pizza.  The menu is fairly small, but it seems like they do what they do really well.  Much in the same way Bill Brasky is the best damn salesman in the office.

For an appetizer we got the nachos, which were all right, certainly not bad by any stretch, but they had a melted cheese sauce which just didn&#39;t do the pretty good tasting chips justice.  Much in the same way Bill Brasky didn&#39;t feel the Grammy&#39;s did the music industry justice so he hosted them himself and gave every award to Corey Hart.

The service was really attentive, nobody would walk by the table without offering to get you something or help clear it away.  It was fast but still friendly.  I&#39;d give it a pretty good review, similar to the good review Brasky&#39;s production of the King and I where he chloroformed the rest of the cast and slowly ate them on stage got.

The one problem though is the aforementioned Brasky Buddies.  There are just too many loud, drunken, middle aged guys in there, telling inane, exaggerated anecdotes so loudly I could hear them more clearly than my wife sitting three feet from me.  A little bit better atmosphere in the place and it just might have earned that fifth star.  But to earn that fifth star you&#39;ve gotta be able to jump off the Empire State Building and only sprain your ankle... like Bill Brasky.

But overall, if you can handle a lot of middle-aged guys yelling at each other from opposite ends of the bar, you&#39;re in for a really good, well-priced burger.

Oh and Bill Brasky?  He&#39;s a son of a b*tch!"

Addison is a miserable town with few Chicago style bars. This place tries to be one, but unfortunely the town is filled with these middle aged drunks that ruin it. I tried to watch a football game here recently and was annoyed at how much they over serve the patrons here. The Tv screens with the exception of one are small. Their large screen has hardly any seating areas to be able to view it. The food here was just plain pre-ordered bar food and this place just as a bad suburban strip mall vibe, which is exactly where it is located.

Rip off...

I am so sorry I wasted my money here... $47.50 to be exact..!!!

I was craving sushi and happened to be in the area on Sunday while shopping with a friend.
I have been to Sushi Bar twice a few years ago and recall having a good experience...nothing mind blowing, but not bad..
I decided to come here since it was nearby shopping and Abashiri was closed (I&#39;ve had that on my list to try..not open on Sun.).

We walked into an empty restaurant around 5ish...we were seated by a not-so-enthusiastic server...There was a worker eating at a table....no big deal, I just felt our server was rather abrupt and wasn&#39;t sure why?  They definitely weren&#39;t slammed with customers...While I perused the sushi options, my friend was looking for anything but seafood..She is not a fan. I asked our waitress about non-sushi offerings and she wasn&#39;t really helpful...again, just abrupt and hasty, and it didn&#39;t help that we had a hard time understanding her...In the meantime, other patrons started walking in (a good sign)...

Suffice it to say, they do not offer a good selection of non seafood items... a few noodle soups, egg rolls and chicken &amp; beef teriyaki...She wasn&#39;t impressed with the selection and I decided it wasn&#39;t fair to her to dine here, so I placed my order to go, since we were already seated and had beverages.  I realize this is a sushi place, but its also a Japanese restaurant and I&#39;ve been to many that do offer a much broader selection of options.. but my experience here is more about the sushi...

I ordered:  Nigiri - Super white tuna &amp; Salmon. Rolls - Volcano, Spicy Tuna, &amp; Shrimp Tempura.  We waited about 25 min. for my order...Later on, upon opening the styrofoam container, I was only given soy sauce.  No ginger.  No wasabi.  Yes, I was bummed.
I also asked for &#34;no sauce&#34; on my rolls and there was sauce...I was so hungry, I didn&#39;t care at that point..

What I did care about.... the really small rolls I received.  The only substantial roll was the Volcano...not only were they small in size, but small in flavor.  Bland.  I couldn&#39;t really taste the fish, more cucumber if anything...The nigiri was just ok and quality was OK, however, after two pieces, I noticed the rice had a flavor I couldn&#39;t pinpoint..something off about it...

I could NOT believe I paid $48 for this.  In fact, I&#39;m still not over it (I loathe being ripped off)..
I absolutely love sushi and have been to many restaurants.  This is completely over priced and so not worth it... How Sushi Bar could receive anything above 3 stars is beyond me.  The sushi and service were mediocre at best. And while I pondered on giving three stars for fresh sushi, I quickly came to my senses. You should ALWAYS be given FRESH fish at a sushi place! That certainly shouldn&#39;t warrant a star...

I can guarantee when I am in this area again craving sushi, and this is my only option...
I will keep driving....."

The sushi was great. Everything tastes fresh and there was a nice portion of fish in each roll. However, the rolls were pricy. We ordered a specialty roll (the tornado) which was an amazing deep fried roll priced at $10 and it only had six pieces. I was also surprised that a can of coke cost $1.75. I would be fine paying a higher price for sushi if the ambience and service were better, but both fell short. Service was inattentive and at times seemed rude. When we walked in they pointed to a table and I took the menus and sat us down. The restaurant itself is small and setup as more of a carry out joint. If we do go back it will be for carry out only."

I just went back this week because my mom had got a groupon or something of the sort, so we figured we&#39;d go check it out since she knows I like sushi. I ordered two plain rolls, salmon avocado and regular tuna - I know, I&#39;m so boring. But I like quality sushi that speaks for itself so it doesn&#39;t need all the sauces and tempura and all that jazz. The salmon and avocado was actually good, I wish I had ordered two of those instead of the tuna. I just don&#39;t think it was great, wouldn&#39;t get it again (and I order tuna sushi all the time). 

I had wanted to order spicy tuna, but I asked if it was the chopped up tuna or the actual pieces and it was the chopped kind. For some reason I never really like those so I didn&#39;t try it, it might be good - I guess I won&#39;t risk finding out. He probably could have offered to put some spicy mayo on my tuna roll for a bit extra or something but that didn&#39;t happen. 

My mom ordered teriyaki chicken, which we both thought was good - it came with zucchini mixed in which works for me. 

The service here....I don&#39;t know how to explain it. They aren&#39;t very friendly, but they aren&#39;t rude. It just feels a bit awkward in a sense.

We were on our way to this place as I was trying to call them to place an order for pick up. First call, just ring ring ring and went to voicemail. I attempted a second call as I thought they are too busy to answer but that second call was to no avail either. Told my driving hubby about it and said let&#39;s just go ahead to the sushi bar and place the order there in person. Pulled in the parking lot and the &#34;open&#34; sign was blinking.
My hubby entered the restaurant and came back to the car in 2 minutes. &#34;That was quick?&#34; I told him. He said nobody&#39;s around  to help him and he saw feet from the table area. I did not ask him to elaborate.
Apparently the staff were having a siesta that time. At least that&#39;s what it seemed to me. So we drove off.

You know exactly what you&#39;re getting with the name, Sushi Bar and Japanese Restaurant. 

At first, I was skeptical by the name and location but after the first meal, I was impressed. The restaurant is small but is often filled with local regulars. There are two unique qualities that make Sushi Bar a local favorite, their creativity and service. They have a wide variety of maki rolls with different sauces from wasabi cream to a sweet and sour orange sauce. Each time we have dined here, we have always received great customer service and the food comes out quickly. Each meal comes with a complimentary miso soup. You can sometimes find coupons for this restaurant as well.

The two maki rolls that I always order are the smoked salmon skin and volcano roll. The smoked salmon skin roll has a strong smoky flavor as if it was just blow torched. Their volcano roll is unique in that it&#39;s a deep fried spicy tuna roll and drizzled with honey mustard. 

Although there are a lot of sushi restaurants in the suburbs of Chicago, Sushi Bar is great if you are in the Bloomingdale area and don&#39;t want to travel too far."

I ordered to go and while waiting, they served me a glass of water.  There are not many places that does this anymore.  I was very impressed by this.  Sushi, I believe, is best when ordering All You Can Eat.  By the time you finish ordering individual rolls, you&#39;ve spent the amount of all you can eat.   Just my opinion."

They had a special going on $11 for $20 worth of food. The service is very pushy, they rushed us into ordering our food. The food was not to shabby but I&#39;ve had better sushi for cheaper. When we got our check, we reminded him about the Groupon we had. Very rudely he asked for the voucher number and Groupon number, which I gave him. He then leaned over the table and attempted to press the &#34;Redeem&#34; button on my phone. By then I had made up in my mind I was not going to return here. Then when it was time for the two other ladies I was with two give him their Groupon information, he Very nastily said &#34;It&#39;s only one per table&#34;. Which indeed it was our fault for not reading the small print.

So we then asked to get our checks split and it went downhill from there. He was yelling at us, telling us it&#39;s one per table, &#34;I can&#39;t split the check, and why can&#39;t one person pay and we pay them back etc&#34;, and mind you their was other customers in the restaurant looking over. Then a lady comes over and he tells her you handle this because I can&#39;t &#34;their complicated&#34;. So we calmly explain to her the situation and she says the exact same thing he says. &#34;Why can&#39;t one person pay, it&#39;s not their problem etc&#34;. So we explained it to her AGAIN! She walked off to split the checks and they were  over in the corner, LOUDLY speaking about us. she comes back and gives us our separate checks and has the NERVE to ask for a tip.

I have never received such poor service in my life! I will never return."

We&#39;ve been there so many times now that the owner and servers know us (we&#39;re very persuasive people...thanks dad!). Every so often, the chef will send us a roll of his choice. Yep, we have the hook ups here. Ha.. I&#39;m a sashimi, nigiri, chirashi kinda girl, so that&#39;s my usual order when I go here ($15 during lunch). I have had the teriyaki lunch boxes a couple times which are really good too. The chicken ($9) can be kinda dry, so go salmon or beef ($10). 

They have a huge selection of rolls to choose from, but aren&#39;t always listed in the menu. Grab the carry out menu when you walk in, it has more sushi options than the dine-in one (not sure why) and there are pictures! Who doesn&#39;t love pictures. Oh, and dinner prices can run pretty steep - so stop in for lunch specials instead.

See you on Sunday Sushi Bar!"

The Sushi is very fresh and clean. Service is great. I read a comment where they person couldn&#39;t explain it but thought it was weird or something.

Usually not packed. I really have nothing extraordinary to say about this place. I&#39;ve tried a few different rolls but nothing completely wowed me. At the same time, nothing really disappointed me either. I would recommend they do something about the music choice. They seem to use an ipod or something but songs or artists repeat over and over and over again. The last visit they let songs play on repeat back to back two to three times before choosing another song, it wasn&#39;t even busy. It was quite annoying so we ate quick to get out of there. Other than that, no complaints. Not as fresh as I&#39;m used to but I have to remind myself I&#39;m not in California anymore."

Vegas? You would think, but no.  San Fran? Nah.  Downtown Chicago.. meh.
The list goes on.  

What I love most about Sushi Bar is that their classics are consistent and tasty, while their specialty rolls hit the mark every single time.  I never order with my fingers crossed that &#34;it will be good this time.&#34;  Sure, some of the rolls may be drowned in mayo, but who doesn&#39;t love devouring a savory, creamy sauce with a delicious cut of fish?  Their Spicy Yellowtail is by far a favorite of mine, as well as the Sakura Roll - yum!

I haven&#39;t been disappointed here in the 6 years I have been a patron.  The staff is wonderful, the place is perfectly clean, and the miso soup is never too too hot!

I feel I should eat crow as my previous review was kind of harsh, and now, after a few more visits, Sushi Bar is a fave. It&#39;s a small sushi house but nice.  If you don&#39;t want to talk to your dining partners, there are 3 flat screen TV&#39;s that are usually on so you can watch whatever sporting event they have on. Service is nice, helpful without hovering. 

As there was a stretch when I couldn&#39;t eat sushi, I came back a few times to try their cooked items--sticking with shrimp and veggie tempura. Their shrimp and veggie tempura is very good.  Fresh shrimp and veggies, not overly cooked or overly battered in tempura,  the food arrives piping hot.  Very tasty and well-made. 

Now that I&#39;m able to partake in sushi--I came back to test the fresh sushi waters again.  As mentioned by other reviewers, their maki menu is large and inventive.  I prefer nigiri, so I stuck with that--yellow tail, super white tuna, shrimp, unagi, squid.  All very fresh and good quality. The rice perfectly done. Super White tuna is my favorite and their SW here is delicious--buttery smooth. 

One thing to note--on weekdays they close between their lunch hours and dinner hours so best not to dine in close to the end of lunch hours.  They will not wait for you to finish your lunch and will expect you be gone by the end of their posted lunch hour.  If you don&#39;t get the hint, perhaps them shutting off the lights and packing their belongings is more of an indicator.  I get it, I get it.  I won&#39;t make that mistake again."

My husband used to think sushi was disgusting until trying this place. Phenomenal! I always get the Mexican volcano roll and the spicy volcano roll, both of which are deep fried. Omg yum, my mouth is watering thinking about it. 

Miso soup is good and always hot when I order it. Service is prompt and I never have to wait long. 

And to the person who gave them 1 star because of their siesta... It states on their door that they are closed from 3-4pm. This is when they nap because they&#39;re there all day, yeah they should lock their front door but read the hours before you walk in.

Crab Rangoon is yummy, too!

Oh and I&#39;ve never had an issue with them splitting checks. Just be courteous and tell them you want separate checks when you order, not that difficult tbh."

Sadly, I did not like the sushi here. I ordered carryout; maybe that was a mistake to do. But the food was promptly made and ready for me when I went to pick it up. So this place gets a star for that. 

The sushi I ordered was drowned in mayonnaise; I knew it would be topped with it, but it overwhelmed the rest of the sushi roll. The rice tasted old and it was fairly dry. The Philadelphia rolls were almost a copy of the rolls I have bought at the deli section of Target.

Not really too big of a fan of the crazy sushi that some places make but this is pretty legit. I guess I&#39;m kind of biased but get the Tom roll. Pretty delicious.

Usually I just get bento boxes though. Steak and shrimp tempura is where it&#39;s at. Tip though, boxes come with vegetable tempura, so unless u really want 3 shrimp tempura, get something else because you&#39;ll get more steak or chicken rather than just 3 shrimp.

Mild complaint, it&#39;s 2011 already so they should get a contract with like coke or pepsi so I can get some free refills man. 1.50 for a can of coke? bah"

The sushi was comparable to china town in San Francisco back in the day and the owners were nice. The spider roll was a naughty fried fav with the crab legs sticking out of the roll. The California roll and tekka maki were perfect! We even had a large family party here in 2001. Now, the staff is not welcoming and act as if they are doing us a favor serving us. Be ready for disgust if you dare to ask for more wasabi or ginger than the small amount they have calculate into their overhead...they obviously have a set ration and any requests for extra is outwardly disapproved of. They also refill tea at a snails pace...all part of the overhead. They smile and talk to one another engagingly/respectfully but literally frown as they approach diners. The spider roll is half the size now and no where near as tasty. The quality has definitely diminished substantially yet the prices are quite high. I know quality sushi is expensive and have no problem paying for quality sushi but this is no longer quality and the staff is just rude. The customers next to us used a GROUPON...what a mistake that was. It was like the soup nazi experience. They were treated horrifically. They shouldn&#39;t participate with groupon if they don&#39;t &#34;welcome&#34; groupon pleasantly. We felt relieved we didn&#39;t have a groupon and shamefully relieved the animosity was then shifted from the other diners onto this poor unsuspecting couple. Now reading here on yelp about employees having sex under a table leaving the door open makes me wonder if our dining there is truly a bother to them for reasons other than I originally thought or is the risk of getting caught a thrill for them? Too bizarre! New roll will be &#34;afternoon delight&#34; roll? Also, how sanitary is this place? Gross! Sadly looking into new places with less intense/irritable staff and fresh ingredients.

I have been here many times and they have stayed consistent. Keep in mind I have only sat at the bar, so service may be different if you sit at the tables.

-Food-
Katsu: They serve chicken or pork katsu. It is enough for two people. You can&#39;t really screw up katsu and hoisin sauce. Very crispy and very tender.

Hand Grenade: It is a pringle and on top if it a mix of tuna, Sriracha, mayo, and crispy bits of tempura and panko with an additional sliver of tuna on top. It&#39;s a nice tasty snack or appetizer. I believe they serve these in twos or threes.

Chirashi: I have often been disappointed in many Chirashis from other restaurants. Many places do not put roe into the Chirashi, but this place does and it&#39;s delicious!

Seaweed salad: Wasn&#39;t memorable. Wasn&#39;t bad, wasn&#39;t exceedingly good. It was just okay.

A la Carte Sushi/Sashimi and rolls: The sushi and sashimi is prepared well. As for rolls I recommend the Dragon Roll, for you non-adventurous types the Police Roll. They have a very nice selection of rolls. The only disappointment is they stopped carrying Otoro.

-Service-
Sitting at the bar the service from the short haired Itamae was excellent. He will remember your favorites/orders from previous visits... even if its only your 3rd. He will also occasionally prepare seaweed salads and hand grenades for you free of charge. What service! I have yet to let the Itamae choose my selections for me (Omakase). But I probably will next visit!

The wait staff around the bar is very attentive and almost never lets your teacup go empty! The older of the bunch is very friendly and will also remember you easily which makes to provide a much more personal and pleasurable experience.

Overall consistency and service is the star at this sushi restaurant and has elevated it from just a 3 (A-OK) star to a 4 (Fan) star."

Yes the sakura roll is swimming in warm mayo (a guilty treat) the Philly roll here is the same as a philly roll anywhere else (that&#39;s why it is a Philly roll ...lol) and no ...this is not a &#34;contemporary&#34; sushi spot.

I have been coming here on and off for eight years. Of the dozens of sushi spots I&#39;ve been to across the country ..Sushi Bar is at the top of the list!  The owners and staff are great, and most have been around all of that time.  It is always great to see the same smiling faces every time I go ...

Old school must-gets are the hand grenades, volcano roll and Hanks special!

The first red flag that went up was the menu. Wow, it&#39;s epic. Like Cheesecake Factory epic. It&#39;s a little overwhelming at first and you can tell immediately that it&#39;s trying a bit too hard. If they could shorten their menu version of War and Peace down to a two pager, they&#39;d easily have better control over what they&#39;re trying to do.

Sushi itself had a lot of fun flavors going on. We did try a few different things and I was happy to find out that it was more hits than misses. 

Pet peeve though, the sushi rice. I come from a family where my grandmother measures down to the half teaspoon of water needed to get her rice JUST so. This place, not so much. I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re rinsing the starches off or soaking it long enough, but it&#39;s coming out way too tough. Still, if you&#39;re able to work through that, there&#39;s a lot interesting things going on otherwise. 

Service is great, the ambiance is great. Only nit-pick there is the music. Or should I say, musak. I think we spent just as much time trying to figure out what bad 80&#39;s song was going to come up next.

Worth a couple visits but that&#39;s about it."

I&#39;m not a big of trendy and &#34;out-of-the-box&#34; maki rolls, but I do enjoy a fun creation once in a while. What I appreciate about Sushi Bar is that they have a large selection of tasty rolls to choose from but they also execute the classics well. Whether it&#39;s the amazingly delicious and unique Volcano Roll (deep fried with cream cheese and spicy mustard sauce) or a quintessential Rainbow Roll, you&#39;re sure to satisfy your craving for a one-of-a-kind experience and for good sushi. 

What makes this restaurant great rather than just good is their attention to detail. The restaurant is clean, the service is always friendly, we never wait long for the food to arrive, and even the hot tea isn&#39;t so hot you can&#39;t pick up the cup or drink it for 15 minutes. They add to their menu frequently and their hot kitchen menu is always a hit with the non-sushi-lovers as well.

If you&#39;re like me and you&#39;re more of a suburban roamer and can&#39;t stand having to go the city for good sushi, I strongly recommend Sushi Bar. You won&#39;t be let down."

The sushi is just okay though.  The rolls aren&#39;t super flavorful and the contents are mashed up into a salad-like consistency.

We were given the impression that we couldn&#39;t stick around a few minutes after close. They started turning the lights off and packing up their things right at 3:00 PM.

Spicy Tuna? Oh yeah!

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE me some sushi!

I&#39;ve been here several times and each time I&#39;ll try something new, but I&#39;ll always start off with Unagi &amp; Spicy Tuna. The Unagi is perfect for easing somebody into sushi. I always tell my friends that it&#39;s like eating BBQ chicken on rice. The Spicy Tuna is pretty good too, just enough kick to it, but not too much to the point that it&#39;ll destroy your mouth.

I recommend the Salmon Skin Roll and highly recommend the Philadelphia Roll. I LOVE the Philadelphia Roll! I know it&#39;s just salmon, avocado, &amp; Philadelphia cream cheese, but for some reason I keep thinking smoked ham whenever I eat it and I can&#39;t get enough of it!

This place is nothing fancy, but the sushi, in my experience so far, has been pretty darn good, the service is fast and friendly, and the prices aren&#39;t outrageous. I&#39;ll definitely be back the next time I&#39;m in the area and need to get my sushi fix.

It&#39;s just like any other small sushi restaurants in any suburban strip malls.  

Interesting to note that they have quite a number of &#34;House Special&#34; sushi named for people who I assume are their frequent and/or regular customers.  

Meal came with Miso soup and green tea.   Waiter was friendly, and attentive.

If you are looking for authentic Japanese/sushi restaurant, this is not the place.  
Most of the sushi seem to be catered more for western taste (heavy with mayo).  Maybe next time, I&#39;ll try asking to ease up on the mayo or any other heavy sauce (ie. Honey Mustard). 

But, the food/sushi are decent.  It was close by.  Prices are reasonable. It was not super crowded (for Friday night).  We will go back and, maybe, try the non-sushi items (with winter is coming, Udon sounds good) from the menu."

Sashimi was terrible. I mean baddd. The salmon one was fine, the rest were awful. The udon was pretty bad as well, amongst the least good ones I have ever had (the tempura it came was was solid). We got a special roll that had spicy tuna and unagi and that was fantastic. Really well done. Service was OK but nothing special. Speed of bringing out our order was quite impressive as well.

So my summary: stick to the rolls that have flavor added (eg spicy ones, ones with avacado, ones with sauces)."

Salmon teriyaki box - salmon was on the thin &amp; dry size,

Sashimi Deluxe - husband enjoyed it, although for the price,
 a couple of more pieces wouldn&#39;t hurt.
The miso soup &amp; the salad, that came with the meal were fine.
The soup wasn&#39;t salty &amp; the salad wasn&#39;t watery, which is my most found flaw with such restaurants that are not too authentic.
The service, for a Friday night, was attentive. 
It wasn&#39;t very busy, a lot of people picking up take out, and they seem to really know their &#39;regulars&#39;. With all of the orders being picked up, we had at least 3 people waiting on us.

I love sushi &amp; this place was a decent little restaurant in the burbs of Chicago.

Food = 30 out of 50
Before I selected my main I was given a complimentary bowl miso soup. It was delightfully seasoned and a good light start to the meal. For my meal I wanted to have several different rolls and they allowed me to order half sized rolls (Extra points for you). I ordered &#34;tasting&#34; portions of the tuna &amp; avocado roll, caterpillar roll, spider roll (no spiders actually in the roll :)) &amp; the tuna &amp; pepper roll. The presentation was nice. They placed two of the  1/2 size rolls on a wooden plank with the wasabi &amp; pickled ginger. The planks were wet which caused my wasabi to become runny and leak all over the plank and that is really my only big complaint about the presentation/food. The fish was decent (It is the Midwest) but it was not anywhere close to what I can get at the nicer sushi bars here in St. Louis. The rolls were not over complicated and they were not drenched in some unnecessary sauce (extra points for you). When I eat sushi I like to have the pure flavors of the fish, rice &amp; vegetables. Simple is almost always better &amp; they did that here. Over all I would say it was good but not crazy good. 

Service = 20 out of 25
The service was very quick. My drink never ran empty and I was given a complimentary bowl of miso soup. The sushi was handed to me over the sushi bar counter as soon as it was complete. Overall the best part of the meal was the attention given to me by the service staff.
 
Atmosphere = 20 out of 25 
The atmosphere was that of a small neighborhood sushi restaurant. Standard Japanese decorations hung on the walls and everyone was very friendly. Most of the customers who came in while I was eating seemed to be regulars - The wait staff new most of them on a first name basis. I got to sit at the sushi bar itself and chat with the 3 sushi chefs working that day. That is always a plus in my mind.

They had a super white salad in a slightly sweetend chili oil dressing with julienne vegtable so fine they were like silk thread. 

You could smell the ocean in the often-scary Uni which was excellent and the miso soup came with the sushi and was what you expect.

The spicy tuna roll and another roll (a special, $13.95 roll made with lobster and cream cheese but I can&#39;t remember the name) were basically just mush.

Prompt and the wait staff does their best to be as personable as possible.  I like how they always remember what I want.  I&#39;ve been going to them for years now and my order rarely varies.  They&#39;re all friendly and very much accommodating.  

Sushi:

Fresh, always consistent and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve ever messed up my order.  That is a big plus for me.  

Ambiance: 

This is a neighborhood spot that gets a lot of attention...on weekends they&#39;re always packed.  Its excellent for a casual date night.  

Value:

Reasonably priced and that&#39;s why I go about twice a month."

The food doesn&#39;t taste fresh, they put so much mayo which makes me believe now that they are hiding that the fish isn&#39;t fresh.  

The place appears to be nice, nice looking bar, nice dining area but it just doesn&#39;t deliver.  I tried taking a non sushi eater here to convert them and couldn&#39;t.  I took them to a place like Sushi House in LaGrange and they were converted quickly.  You can notice a huge difference in freshness.  I also brought family with me when they were in town visiting and they weren&#39;t happy.  They are sushi eaters as well and they didn&#39;t care for anything but one item and we ordered simple stuff.  So I don&#39;t think its just me.

I know that sushi is better when you are eating it right from the chef but sometimes I just want to relax with a movie and get my sushi fix. The sushi was fresh but some of the rolls we picked weren&#39;t exactly my favorite. In particular there was one that was topped with so much mayo sauce that it was definitely gross. Unfortunately it only takes one bad roll for me to go from great to so-so. The normal rolls that I get were great though - crunchy roll, spicy tuna, spicy salmon.

On another note the miso soup was very good and for the price it was a good value.  I will try this place again and steer clear from the rolls with mayo sauce on top."

At least something in life stays refreshingly consistent.

Good food. The menu has expanded dramatically from what I remember. Sushi was fresh and tasty, and while I typically don&#39;t order wacky stuff where I can admire the artistry I can appreciate a well executed spread.

There was a goof where my tuna and yellowtail order quantity were reversed, but it was quickly resolved. I&#39;d have appreciated if the rest of my food were left with me at the table while this was fixed instead of having it whisked away, but to their credit it was returned quickly."

The name and its location (strip mall) made me hesitate a long time.  I walk in, and I see mostly non-Asian customers, and I hesitate again.  I order and eat, and I am in heaven with a huge sigh of relief escaping from my lips.  A decent sushi place...in the far west suburbs!  Yahoo!  

I thought the specialty rolls were inventive and tasty -- they had quite a variety.  Crab rangoon was tasty.  They have a lot of other items on the menu, too, like bento boxes, etc.  I enjoyed my super white tuna roll, spicy salmon roll and magura sashimi.  My fiance enjoyed the Philadephia roll (I never partake with him because I think it is sacrilege to have cheese adjacent to raw fish), dragon roll, and eel specialty roll.  

We were stunned.  I truly expected mediocre tasting sushi, but instead we ate a pretty darn good sushi meal.   My only criticism is that there is way, way, way too much mayo in the spicy rolls -- I don&#39;t mind the spicy stuff but the mayo needs to be cut back.  Service was terrific, too.  And it was good to see Asian sushi chefs --- though not a guarantee of good sushi, it is always kind of a mark of credibility!

Prices were reasonable, too.   If it were closer to my home, I think I might be eating at this place every day!  LOL..."

I ordered the pad Thai and my lunch date had the pad se ew. The lunch special was very nice portion and priced at $8.

Ordered Thai Basil Beef and pretty disappointed to see very tiny portion of meat &#34;chopped up&#34;. Most was fat trimmings. The main spotlight the dish seemed to take was all vegetables and sauce..
too sweet, no spice at all. tasted like sugar water.

Curry chicken filled a container halfway, little to no meat again and all sauce.

Quality: below average

Pretty much had sauce and rice for dinner, not something I want to start the week off with..
Maybe I went on a bad day, considering reviews were above and beyond- who knows.

Rather not order from here again.

I ordered the pad thai and was shocked to see very thin noodles and the flavor which did not resemble it at all. Not to mention that I came for rice noodles because I am gluten free, generally speaking, and I was very nervous not knowing what type of noodles where on my plate.

We also ordered a sweet and sour dish and there was hardly any chicken on the plate. While the warm cucumbers were amazing, we cannot justify paying for chicken when there was hardly any.

I was really looking forward to this and left sadly disappointed.

I am SO glad I did, but I only wish that this restaurant was closer to my house - it is nearly an hour one way...

The service was good, not great, but the food more than made up for it.  The fresh spring rolls were very flavorful and the dipping sauce had a nice kick to it.  My Panang Curry (tofu) had a good flavor, but the spicy level was determined by the staff, thinking that I might not want it too spicy (they tend to be on the spicy side, they said).  It had some heat, but I wanted more, they brought me a spice tray, but it is not the same as having the spice bloom in the cooking process.

My daughter had Pad See Ewe and the flavor was nice and didn&#39;t have the &#39;standard&#39; dark brown gravy, the sauce was tan in color, but much more flavorful with notes of black pepper."

Had a Singha to start which always is nice...

Spring Rolls were so-so. Good wrapper but the 33% cucumber log was out of balance. I&#39;d skip it.

Pad Thai was pretty good. Medium spicy is on par with real Thai as it&#39;s hot for the white folk...

The lunch special soup is like a bouillon cube broth with a bit of tofu and a couple shredded veggies...

The Crab Rangoon (I think that&#39;s what it was) had all cream cheese and maybe some crab flavor. The shell was nice and crispy.

The egg roll was useless carbs/and was frozen in the center. The soup had a nice flavor, but again-another anemic gesture. Would it really put you &#34;out of business&#34; to put out a real home-made veggie spring-roll (or two even) and a larger &#34;cup&#34; of broth with some actual vegetables in it?

People talk about what tire restaurant is always better than the rest and the truth is there all American Thai and therefore pretty much all the same. Just like Italian, Greek, or Chinese.

What separates Yupin from every othe Thai restaurant  is the owner is Thai themselves  and the food is as authentic as they come. Someone else on the previous review said that the food was like street vendor  food that you get in Thailand. I&#39;ve never been to Thailand so I don&#39;t know. My mom though is from Thailand and the food that she makes enough at home is the same food that you get at this restaurant. At your own discretion as for Thai hot, you&#39;ll see the difference tween nothing at restaurant and a regular Thai  restaurant. My favorite meal here is the catfish and basil friend rice!!!

1. The soup was basically chicken broth in a bowl with some veggies/ tofu thrown in. Pretty average.

2. The egg roll was good, but so tiny! 

On top of the lunch special, I ordered Crab Rangoon because I&#39;ve heard great things (which are true!) My fresh out of the deep-fryer steaming bundles of cream cheese and crab were soooo good! Crispy breading with significant filling. 

The Pad Thai was on par as well. The right amount of sauce to noodle ratio with peanuts on the side so you could add as many as you wanted. I wish there were more green things i.e. cilantro, lime, bean sprouts (is that Americanized Thai?) Bonus: I ordered a medium level of spice which helped clear up my stuffy nose. 

I would suggest just ordering the main dish instead of the lunch special because they do their main dishes really well. The waitresses were attentive but very busy. Lunch took me about an hour."

The place was quiet when we arrived so we chose where to sit, and the waitress quickly brought out waters and menus (which had pictures next to each item--bonus). 
We split the Crab Rangoon and, no lie, it really is the best I&#39;ve had. Perfect combination of crispy and soft. My friend ordered the Pad Thai and I ordered the Pad See Ewe. Both were phenomenal. Both kinds of noodles were cooked to perfection. Our helpful, friendly waitress showed us how to customize the amount of spice we wanted in our food. 
I think I found my go-to Thai place. Can&#39;t wait to bring more friends to try this place out!"

But we decided to give it a try this weekend and I am glad we did. We order two orders of pad kee Mao, pad Thai, and yellow curry all at varying spices levels. Everything was fabulous. The yellow curry was a bit heavy on the oil. The pad Thai was easily the best among the Thai restaurants in the area.

Their beef pad see-ew is really good as well we their tofu pad thai and tom yum soup (no MSG taste, it must be from scratch). Fried springroll and crab rangoon were also good. I didn&#39;t care much for their fried rice or chicken satay.

After eating at Yupin Thai, the search is over.

The little jars of spices they bring to the table is a perfect representation of the restaurant. The sauce they said was similar to Sriracha sauce was the mild sauce. The sauce that they consider hot is made there with chiles that they grow themselves! They also bring a sugar bowl because, they said, most Thai restaurants here offer sweeter dishes to suit the American tastes, but they make the dishes more traditionally so some people like to add sugar.

I added nothing, and it was perfect.

Before ordering, we asked the waitress what spice level was equal to a buffalo wing. She said she didn&#39;t know that buffalo wings were supposed to be spicy, so I decided I should go for the mild, which had a nice, subtle burn. My boyfriend opted for hot, and it was exactly what he wanted -- hot but with a lot of great flavor throughout the dish. We also got egg rolls, which seemed very fresh.

Before we even got to my car, my boyfriend was talking about which dish he wanted to try next time. We will be back. Highly recommended."

The lady that runs Yupin is Thai (!), she cooks while her 3 daughters take care of the service. 
They explained to me that their cuisine is authentic, and therefore they do not add sugar to appeal to the American palate. Rather, you can add sugar yourself if you feel like. 
Also a word about the spice level (rewording what others have written). I ignored the &#39;very spicy&#39; warning and regretted it a bit (it was delicious though!). So on my second visit I ordered the spicy stuff on the side, it&#39;s a cool portable tray with 4 dishes: 
one contains sugar, then there is dry spicy chili and seeds, then what looks like sambal oelek (not too spicy), and finally a darker chili and seeds mix that swims in a sauce and it tastes smoky, and is very spicy. When they say spicy they mean it so beware, whitey. 

After 2 visits I can say I will become a regular. They&#39;re close to where I work and at these prices why not indulge?! 
I found the service to be excellent and very attentive. 
It&#39;s awesome little places like these that I would rather eat at :)

The Crab Rangoon was delicious, the Spring Rolls delicious. Presentation and taste were delightful. For the entree, I had Ginger Chicken and my date had Garlic Chicken. Honestly, they were both very good, but the Garlic Chicken was better only due to the lack of enough Ginger in the dish, at least for me, to be able to taste it mixed with all the vegetables and seasoning. I did request extra Ginger and that I would pay for it if necessary, however, the owner&#39;s husband  said they don&#39;t do that, since it overpowers the delicate balance of flavors in the dish. OK, so now I taste everything but the Ginger. Still delicious, but, next time I will request and if necessary demand it, or just order a different dish. Great food, decent service, definitely  worth a try."

Chile Relleno: 4/5
This was a first for me and I&#39;m glad I tried it!

Verdict: Very good: soft, melty, slightly cheesy, and slightly sweet. I&#39;m a fan!


Lengua: 5/5
Another first! Both a student and instructional aide swear by tongue/lengua, so I HAD to try. 
(Sorry-not-sorry, Mom!)

Verdict: AMAZING! So tender and delicious! I think I just found my new favorite taco! (And by &#34;favorite,&#34; I mean that I&#39;m seriously contemplating a return visit tomorrow!)


Al Carbon: 5/5
I&#39;ve had many-a steak taco, but not al carbon before! 

Verdict: Great flavor and texture without being chewy. I&#39;m not convinced I can go back to regular steak tacos after this! The only downsides were the saltiness and skimpy meat quantity as compared to my other tacos. 


Pollo: 4/5
Ahh, an oldie but goodie.

Verdict: Pretty good, but on the dry side. It seems to be made with just white meat, so maybe that&#39;s why? It was also pretty salty. The portion was generous.


Al Pastor: 3/5
I&#39;m not a big pork eater (minus the occasional bacon and ham), but I&#39;m not against it. I figured, why not?

Verdict: Just &#34;okay&#34;: it was dry and I didn&#39;t taste any pork; just spices. It required lots of salsa to make it more palatable. Meh.


SPEAKING of salsas...
The verde was my favorite. The &#34;medium-heat&#34; red was also good: it had great texture! Know it has the &#34;delayed&#34; heat that kicks in after a good few seconds.

I&#39;m disappointed it took me so long to get to La Placita, but I&#39;m certain that I&#39;ll soon be a regular!"

As you might have gathered from reviews other than mine, Addison is quite the place to get authentic mexican cuisine. This place is among the top of the pack. The food they serve is fresh, flavorful, and affordable. The venue is kept clean, with wonderful decor. Add to that the loud blasting TV (volume could be lowered a bit!) with soap operas in Spanish that only adds to the ambiance.

I didn&#39;t get a chance to try the chile relleno, but I had the &#34;carbon&#34; meat, which is essentially beef stake slices. It&#39;s different than carne asada. It&#39;s softer on the chew, and more flavorful, with noticeable peppery taste and other spices I can&#39;t identify. The plate sizes are always generous with rice, beans, veggies, and tortilla, and I would say worth the money. 9/10 I had a taco with al pastor pork, and it&#39;s quite good, but I still their carbon beef. 7/10. I also got a chicken plate because I saw that they branded their own chicken with its own logo and all! It&#39;s grilled with skin-on, and it tastes great. Savory, mouthwatering taste. Oh, and the plate is only $7. We had leftovers and were happy to take it home! 8/10"

Shame on me!  Hey, better late than never.  So, after hearing some &#39;buzz&#39; about how great this place is I decided I needed to check it out.  Its located in a small outdoor mall on Lake, just past Mill Road, down the street from New China.  Walking in, there&#39;s a good number of tables to dine in and the menu selection is extensive...place looked clean and girls were really nice...they were busy, busy, busy...

They had all the fillings for tacos &amp; burritos I enjoy - Barbacoa, Cecina, Carnita, Chile Relleno, Al Pastor, Pollo, Camaron, Carne Asada and a few I have not seen - Carne al Carbon &amp; El Pollo Real (they&#39;re branded grilled chicken - this looked delicious)...they have tongue as well (for you Lengua lovers).

Going against my usual &#39;go to&#39; tacos, I went with the Carne al Carbon &amp; half grilled chicken plate (comes with beans &amp; rice) $5.99.  I had a HUGE taste for a Chile Relleno, but sadly, they were all out (yes, I was super bummed &amp; a little cranky, cause I&#39;m guessin, these must be really good..).  What can I say, my tastebuds are used to having their way....  

The &#39;Al Carbon&#39; is a steak taco but resembles more of a sliced steak fajita (only thinner strips). I ordered mine with only lettuce, cheese, avocado and crema on a corn tortilla (comes w/fresh cut lime).  KNOW that this is NOT the same flavor as fajita meat, just the resemblance (to give you an idea).  

After first bite, you wanna know the first thing that struck me?  How much I LOVED THIS CORN TORTILLA!  I don&#39;t know if they are homemade, or where they get them, but this tortilla made my taco!  Mild corn flavor, heated through and just merged perfectly with the tender, lightly seasoned steak...not &#39;juicy&#39;,  but tender (non gristly), good quality meat...
A few squirts of fresh lime juice and this TOTALLY hit the spot.

The El Pollo plate was very SAVORY, tender  (skin-on, 1/2 portion).  Refried beans were light (not heavy or salty) and rice was ok.  I really enjoyed this too...(if your a regular here, and haven&#39;t tried it yet, I say go for it..).

Prices are very LOW!  I love that you can choose corn or flour tortilla&#39;s and toppings such as avocado, fresh lime (comes w/tacos), etc. Good selection of hot (green/red) sauces...I gotta tell ya, the soups looked fantastic too..Caldode Res &amp; Menudo is a must try the next time I visit (along w/a sampling of more taco&#39;s).

This is no doubt, a solid, authentic Mexican joint and out of all the others&#39; nearby, I&#39;d say GO TO LA PLACITA FIRST (the reviews here are pretty spot on).  Open late too...

Adios amigos!"

Tacos! Tacos! Tacos! I met up with some Yelpy friends and I was near death status in the hunger department so boy, did I revel in the basking light the tacos radiated out when placed in front of me. I scarfed them down in probably 90 seconds flat. During my scarf-fest, I did taste some flavors I liked though. I had the carne asada &amp; pollo - my usual go-tos for meat in a tortilla. They are competitively priced with my usual taco joint and I liked them - but I think my usual spot edges them out ever so slightly.

Thank goodness for Yelp and fellow Yelpers. Without it, I would have been forced to try all 60 &#34;authentic&#34; spots before tasting the goodness of LP. I heard of this place from Erika and she referred to it as an area favorite and place the group visited for an UYE. If it was good enough for the gang, I figured it was worth a try. .....Needless to say it has become a favorite of mine. I really love the food here. I have now been a few times and agree they occasionally get the order wrong and the prices seems to fluctuate and largely depends on who is at the register. But even when certain toppers are missed, it still reigns as the taco of all tacos. 

I have tried a few different meats and prefer cecina. I also spend an extra buck for a Jarrito or Guava drink as opposed to the regular can soda that is offered with the combo.

 Call in, dine in or walk in. Just get here and enjoy the best that Addison/Glendale Heights/Schaumburg/Bloomingdale has to offer. We all need a little cilantro and lime in our lives."

Based on all of the positive reviews from fellow elites, La Placita is legit. I would definitely order the al pastor and the alambres taco again since they were both delicious. The carne from the chilaquiles and the al carbon were a bit dry and overlooked but otherwise our table enjoyed the salsas and the horchata. Normally, mild salsa doesn&#39;t do anything for me but La Placita&#39;s has avocado blended into it giving it a creamy finish - make sure to get some on the side.

There are a whole lot of Mexican food places in this immediate area.  You would go through quite a few miles of burritos to try them all.  I&#39;ve found some pretty good places, but none really hit the sweet spot that I know is there.

I have been to the mountain-top, but not in a while.....

Enter Yelp.

I came across reviews for this place in the &#39;talk&#39; section and immediately high-tailed it on over.

The decor is not much to speak of.  Some tables, seating for maybe 30 people.  I rolled in at about 11:30, stopped to get the door for someone and that turned out to be my only mistake in coming here.

The door holdee ordered ahead of me.  Couple of tacos.  So far, so good.  I stepped and popped in for a few more.  We both grabbed some chair to wait for the goodies.

About 2 minutes into this the door opened and 10 people walked in and arranged themselves at a table they made by pushing a few 4 tops together.  Partay in progress.

Door holdee got her food.  The girl behind the counter took her money, handed over her tacos and then came out to wait on the 10 top.  I could see my stuff sitting there, but there was nothing I could do but wait, so I did so- somewhat impatiently, and on my ever shortening lunch break, but about 12 hours or so later I got my stuff and headed back to the office.

And, yeah, the tacos (Al Carbon this time) are verrry good.  I don&#39;t know what some places do to just serve up a palate party while it seems others stick a pile of crud on your tortilla, but these were utterly delicious.  Great meat filling, tender, not all fatty/gristly/gross.

The Horchata here is also very good.  There&#39;s also a cooler stocked with Mexican Coke, Jarritos, and other Mexican favoritos de bebida.

The free chips and salsa were tasty, but some of that salsa was too hot for my liking.

The restaurant is clean, and there is plenty of seating.  The waitress will take your order at your table, and you pay at the register when you are ready to leave.

It&#39;s a comfortable little place tucked away in a small, not so populated strip mall, I actually almost passed it. We thought we had to order at the cash register, but after the cashier assisted customers in front of us she said we can pick a table and she&#39;ll be out to take our order.  She then greeted us with complimentary chips and salsa (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-placita-addison?select=ZJAH6A1GkCxdpoS3DuxDAQ#SeL8bIVIFF1YW_qXnXy7Jw) that we devoured! The salsa is deliciously spicy! We asked for seconds and water *whew*.

We ordered:
5 Taco Special: steak, onions, cilantro, and lime (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-placita-addison?select=ZJAH6A1GkCxdpoS3DuxDAQ#c-ejkPrD6pKEj-8I0exytA), which was meh. Definitely average not much to rave about here.

Roast Pork Torta Special: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-placita-addison?select=ZJAH6A1GkCxdpoS3DuxDAQ#hBN70igCkWnbLOGculqLMA), I would of loved rice and beans with this, not the fries, but the roast pork was packed with flavor and holy this thing was huge. I&#39;m glad we split it.

Chicken Tostada (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-placita-addison?select=ZJAH6A1GkCxdpoS3DuxDAQ#zKZNELTf9pMhdRCROlGwww): I LOVE toastadas and this thing was huge for a single order! Packed with shredded chicken which was extremely flavorful, tender, and just down right delicious! I mean look at the size of the avocado they give you, yum yum. I love that they aren&#39;t skimpy on the meat and toppings esp. for one order.

The tacos might have been the rave on Yelp, but honestly their salsa and shredded chicken are the hidden gem, which I&#39;ll gladly come back for!"

Turn around as it is well worth it.  I have only had tacos, but they are excellent.  You can&#39;t go wrong with the $6.99 dinner.  3 tacos, rice, beans, and a can of soda.

Decided to go simple and got a carne asada burrito. What&#39;s inside? Some avocado, sour cream, lettuce, meat, and refried beans. Not a California burrito but it was still very good! I didn&#39;t get the side of fries or a drink. They offer the burrito al carbon which means they use better cuts of meat (is what she explained to me, hah). It was very good! I also was given chips and salsa which were very delicious. Overall, it cost $4.49 plus tax. Super cheap lunch! Go here if you&#39;re ever in this city."

Seriously, where did this siren of a senorita come from, and why is she working in a Taqueria off Lake Street in Addison, Il? 

Well, God works in mysterious ways and I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ll ever know the answer to that, but Jesus Christo! ... I&#39;ll be damned if it isn&#39;t worth the trip alone, just to see her. 

And while my tacos weren&#39;t blowing my mind, they were still damn good and had more avocado on them than any other tacos I&#39;ve ever had, including tacos I&#39;ve made myself- and that&#39;s saying something because I load that sh*t on. I will give a little criticism of their house-made hot sauces, both of which were pretty runny and not hot at all. 

The horchata on the other hand, is the stuff dreams are made of, and the size of a large cat. Muy bien, Muchachos.

One last talking point- the prices. For dinner on very little dinero, this is your place. I got 3 tacos, a quesadilla and one hell of an horchata for $10 and change.

Burrito, soda and fries ($4.99): great price, portions are huge and fries were perfectly warm (love when I get fries that were just made)..

Buritto was huge and tasted good, but I still think Buenos Dias Burritos have the best burritos.. :)

My husband and I opted to share two entrees - he got the chicken enchiladas in suiza sauce and I got the La Placita Especial, which was described as steak fajitas.

- Al Pastor Taco (5/10)

I ALSO TRIED
- Carne Asada Taco (5/10)
- Lengua (Tongue) Taco (4/10)
- Beans &amp; Rice (4/10)
- Horchata (6/10)

After visiting a friend and celebrating his new house with a nice cigar and 20 year old Port (on an empty stomach) we really needed to eat! Only problem was, it was late (~9:00p) and not a lot of things were open. All I could see were a couple Mexican joints, and I LOVE taquerias and hole in the wall Mexican places, so I thought this was gonna be great! Well..

AL PASTOR TACO
As always, I get all my tacos with onion and cilantro. The al pastor didn&#39;t really have a lot of flavor - nothing really punched out but seasoning was acceptable. Ok, it had just enough flavor to make you realize it&#39;s not asada, but that&#39;s about it. I had a to use a lot of the salsa to pick it up. That taco was a pretty normal size too, like the size of a CD or a little bit bigger.

CARNE ASADA TACO
I&#39;d say it was a little better than the al pastor in terms of flavor (a nice smoky grilled taste), but the seasoning was absent. Again, more salsa! Texture was right on for asada. Not terrible, but not great either.

LENGUA TACO
A tongue taco! I&#39;ve had a lengua taco once before, and honestly, it wasn&#39;t all that great either. Lengua (tongue) almost has a light tripe-y flavor, but almost...buttery. It&#39;s really not bad. The flavors were subtle but definitely there, but again, the seasoning was nowhere to be found. Thank you salsa! Really, adding the salsa made all the tacos jump about a full 1 point out of 10. But a taco really shouldn&#39;t need that help! 

BEANS &amp; RICE
The beans were too salty. It wasn&#39;t quite burn-your-lip salty, but close enough. It wasn&#39;t a pleasant experience. The rice was pretty standard, nothing special.

HORCHATA
I&#39;d say, this was the highlight of the experience. Honestly, only because it was cool and refreshing. It was kinda devoid of any cinnamon flavor, though, so it just tasted like rice sugar water. I don&#39;t like a lot of cinnamon, but I like SOME!

LA PLACEBO
There is no substance here! Everything here successfully fills you up and quells hunger, but that&#39;s all it does. (I get it...first world problems). The tacos are really uninspiring and unless you&#39;re just hungry outta your mind and have nowhere else to go, there is really no point in stopping here. Nothing tasted bad, but nothing tasted good! There&#39;s nothing to write home about here. Hell, there&#39; pretty much nothing to Yelp about either! BOoooooooooooooooring!"

The food is the best Mexican I&#39;ve had, and it&#39;s an expansive menu with everything from your giant burritos, tortas, breakfast, seafood, it goes on-and-on.  I will upload pictures of the menu so you can see the descriptions and jaw-dropping value for the prices.

I always gauge a taqueria on its chips and salsa, La Placita is excellent.  Horchata?  Perfect.  A quick wink and nod to the $1.50 take out chips and a 20oz styrofoam cup of salsa that needs repeating from others&#39; reviews.

So far I&#39;ve had a beef stew in red sauce and a chicken chimichanga.  The quality of the chicken is paramount since I&#39;ve finally found a place that uses pulled/ shredded chicken!  No cubes of white chicken parts!!

Buenos dias, amigos!"

Of course besides tacos, they have tortas, burritos, roasted chicken, enchiladas and nacho platters.  I&#39;ve only done take-out (twice in a week! whoa!) but they are really friendly and on my last visit, told me to get an extra soda if I wanted one.  Niiiiiice.

Chicken taco/nacho platter--it&#39;s shredded chicken, but still has a nice flavor and was really moist.  The nacho platter is full of nice crispy tortilla chips, topped with mounds of the chicken and bits of white cheese. Very good.
Carnitas taco--great bit of charring from the cooking process, nice flavor, a bit dry. 
Al Pastor taco--nice flavor, but also a bit dry.  My fave is still at the carniceria down the road.
Steak taco--This was my favorite and the one I will most likely order each time I visit. Really flavorful, tender meat. 

The rice and beans are OK.  It was more like a filler, but adding some of their salsas upped the flavor.  And the salsas?  There is a nice selection you could choose from--Pico   de Gallo, Salsa Verde (my fave! so flavorful), a Habanero salsa (super hot for me), an avocado salsa, and their house red salsa.  There is also a milder red salsa that the woman behind the counter told me that I probably would not like as she said it&#39;s pretty mild--my guess that it&#39;s there for the folks that don&#39;t like the hot stuff.  

Their Horchata is pretty tasty too. Icy cold and perfect when your mouth is on fire from the Habanero sauce. 

Friendly service.  Clean space. Great stop in A-town."

The tv&#39;s were all tuned in to Spanish channels &amp; Spanish music was playing.  Good signs that the food will eb extra authentic.  If you walk into a Mexican restaurant &amp; Gossip Girl is playing on the TV chances are that the food won&#39;t be that authentic.  


The chips were a little bit harder than I liked but the salsa was amazing &amp; it was really spicy.  It is really hard for me to call something spicy because I eat a lot of spicy foods but this salsa was excellent.  

I did liek that they gave you fries with your meal even though they were nothing special.  The beef in the steak buritto was delicious &amp; tasted very fresh.  I don&#39;t really like guacamole but I could tell that it was really fresh &amp; tasty.

First off, it was a Sunday and they were busy - probably 8-9 tables full in the place.   There was one waitress who took our order and took a while to come back with drinks/chips/salsa.   We were watching some telemundo programming and waited...and waited....and waited.   Finally after about 30 minutes, the food came out.

We went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and it was pretty dead.  It is your typical small Mexican taqueria by looks and the menu.  The waitress brought us a basket of chips and some salsa that was really spicy and tasted just okay.  

I ended up ordering 4 different tacos (barbacoa, carne asada, al pastor and chile relleno) and Fred got the taco dinner with tacos alambre, which the lady said was bacon and chorizo but ended up just being bacon, undercooked bacon, that is.  The food took a while to come out which is not typical of little Mexican places which was downer number one.  Downer number two was that undercooked bacon, and let me remind you, no chorizo.  Boo.  And finally, downer number three was the dryness of the meats on my tacos and the undercooked poblano on my chile relleno taco. =[  The only meat worth mentioning was the barbacoa, not too fatty and super tender and flavorful, but the downfalls of everything else will make this the last time I come here.  

Moral of the story...there are SOOO many good Mexican places within 5 miles of here, there is really no point in wasting your time.

PS...what was with all the $70,000+ cars in the parking lot?!?!  Maybe Mexicans with money forget what good Mexican food tastes like...not sure.  Sorry Placita...just not impressed."

You would think with there being a large Mexican population in the area that they would all be phenomenal, but that&#39;s not the case. Most of these places are just ok and many are downright awful. The place in the strip mall across the street from La Placita is horrible. Some of the worst Mexican food I&#39;ve ever consumed.

So, I wandered into La Placita with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. This is somewhere above a real &#34;sit down&#34; Mexican restaurant and Taco Bell. And for that category it&#39;s the best in the area. From 355 to York Rd. this is the best Mexican food you can get. Carry out or sit and eat.

I had the steak burrito with fries.  Their steak burrito is a &#34;dry&#34; burrito but please don&#39;t mistake that as dried out.  The steak has great flavor - it almost tastes as if they apply a type of rub before chopping the meat.  Fried beans, guacomole and sour cream are applied lightly as a condiment and don&#39;t overpower the meat.  It&#39;s a neat burrito in the hand without being dry.
I also had an al pastor taco that was very good.  It came with cilantro and diced onions.  I added a quick squeeze of lime and it was delicious.
My wife ordered the chicken burrito.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, they prepare their chicken shredded in a marinade.  It was very moist and tender.  My wife really enjoyed it. 
The food is excellent at La Placita and the prices are are really low.  This is definitely THE spot for Mexican food on Lake Street!"

The food is seriously good and the price just makes it better.  I do suggest splurging a bit and getting some guacamole its the chips and salsa, I think its the best guac i&#39;ve ever had.

Where can you get 3 tacos with rice and beans and a can of soda for like $5.50? I usually get steak, chicken and barbacoa in my taco dinner. And their salsas are really good. I recommend the green one!!

I&#39;ve tried the chicken platter which was ok. It wasnt as fresh but I def recommend their taco dinner. This place is my TO-Go for tacos."

Nothing will replace my favorite, but a 30+ minute round trip commute made me need to find a taco joint closer to home, and La Placita is that place.  After working a long Sunday evening at my second job, tacos were on my mind.  I didn&#39;t see any places on my ride home so I decided to check out a new place.  After glancing through reviews La Placita looked like the place to go.  When I walked in, I could see this was the local place to be.  It&#39;s always a good sign for a taco place when english is the second language written on the menu/spoken.   I ordered my traditional steak tacos and fries (to go) and waited for them to be cooked up fresh.  They have a whole salsa bar to choose from.  When I got home I was pleasantly surprised to see they include limes with your tacos.  You don&#39;t realize what you&#39;re missing until you&#39;ve had tacos with fresh lime juice on top.  I can only speak to the steak tacos (both mexican and american style) and fries, but I will (and have!) definitely been back for these."

The grill area in the back is open so you can see them prepare everything so you know exactly how your food is cooked.  The staff is welcoming and the food is stellar at a great value.  I had the torta and it was very filling.  The bread wasn&#39;t dry and my milanesa was well-breaded with a nice crunch yet meaty.  The toppings were fresh while the fries were adequate.  My tacos al pastor were nicely grilled and the onion and cilantro didn&#39;t overpower the meat.  I&#39;ll definitely be back to try out more of the menu and specials!

Wanting to try someplace new, we stopped in here for dinner during the week. When we first entered it wasn&#39;t clear if you were to order at the counter, then sit down or just sit down and be waited on. If you want to dine in, you just grab a table and someone will be by to take your order.

We ordered the burrito dinner (steak) and the taco dinner (chicken). Both dinners came with a can of pop. Odd that they had diet Coke, but not regular Coke rather Pepsi. 

Anyways, I really enjoyed my tacos. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful and had a consistency of being pulled (not strips of chicken). And there was an abundant amount, they definitely did not skimp! The burrito was really good too but a tad greasy. I found the rice to be a bit dry, still edible though. I like my rice to be a bit sticky and fresh tasting. Seems like this rice was cooked maybe earlier in the day? 

Also, paying took forever. There was only one girl behind the counter and she seemed to be a bit overwhelmed.

To start off the prices are amazing. Burrito for $4 and chips with salsa for a meager $1.50. The salsa came in a 20oz cup for gods sake. The burrito was big but not huge and had all the staples minus the rice but had avocado which was a nice touch. The taco was a little small but had great flavor and came with a lime wedge also a nice touch. The guacamole was ok but nothing to write home about.

The one word that comes to mind is &#34;ONO-licious!&#34;  I had the &#34;Road Rage&#34; burger with pulled pork and cole slaw on a pretzel bun, and the &#34;Full Throttle&#34; fries.  My wife had the &#34;Spare Tires&#34;, while my kids had the &#34;Lead Foot Nachos&#34;.  Everything was beyond what we anticipated and every bite was savored.  I was hoping to try other dishes, but by the time I was able to get back, they had closed up shop.  Basically, it was THAT GOOD!!!

On a slightly serious note, with the rise of so many excellent food trucks in the food industry comes the unique and expressive creativity of the chef/entrepreneur of the mobile operation.  It seems as though it&#39;s becoming a rarer occurrence to encounter a food truck that serves sub-par offerings (with the exception of personal palate preferences and/or the staff having a rough day).  In my experience, food trucks present their customers with a distinctive interpretation of classic dishes, and it&#39;s typically worth your while to try a number of menu items to determine your preference.

In my humblest opinion, Best Truckin&#39; BBQ lands among the BEST of them!

A friend had told me about them and when I saw the truck recently at a food truck meetup, I was determined to try them right away. I was their first customer of the day (lucky me!) and the staff seemed really energetic and enthusiastic about their items.

I love pulled pork morning, noon and night (minus the morning) so I had to get the Interstate BBQ sandwich. The Interstate is $7 and is a BBQ Pork Sandwich-hand seasoned pork shoulder, smoked for twelve hours, chopped, sauced, &amp; served on your choice of bun (according to their menu). You can pick from a brioche roll or pretzel bread. You can also get the sandwich in slider form for just $3.50. I liked the sandwich an awful lot, ever so slightly dry but great flavor. It&#39;s left me wanting more!

They have a Bacon chocolate brownie....Yea I&#39;m going to need to get that the next time I get Best Truckin&#39; BBQ. And oh yes, there will be a next time. The truck is stationed in Schaumburg and makes a lot of stops in the area - perfect for a weekday lunch for me!"

They tasted stale and hard. Staff was friendly and quick with my order. I wished they taped my wrapped sandwiches in place because it fell apart in my bag when I was taking them out.

It&#39;s also topped with cilantro lime slaw) and two sides; Jackknife (pepper jack mac and cheese with roasted red peppers,  green chiles and crunchy baked top) and Over The Road (spicy orzo and black beans served with fresh veggies and feta cheese).

The sandwich was pretty dang good, for a mini slider. The chicken had good flavor and I enjoyed the slaw even though I didn&#39;t detect any cilantro or lime notes in it. I think the bbq sauce may have overpowered it.

The jackknife? Nothing short of amazing. I could eat this stuff all day long! The pepper jack cheese was creamy and I loved the incorporation of the red peppers and green chiles. 

Finally the Over The Road was really good as well, though there was a bit more feta cheese on it than I would have liked.

Too many yelpers I adore have rated this place 4+ stars, so I must have done something wrong, cuz I was just a-ok with this truck o&#39; BBQ.

I was beyond elated to learn that Best Truckin&#39; BBQ was going to be AT my office last week. Not a good walk away, but liiiiiiterally right downstairs. Perfect for the lazy glutton with discerning tastes! When I walked up to the truck, I had no idea what I wanted and there was kind of a line, so I ordered in a rush. I got the cheese fries, an order of hush puppies, and an Expressway mini pretzel slider. The menu is cute with themed transport names running throughout.

The food is ready FAST - I meandered away to smoke (yeah yeah I know I&#39;m trying to quit), and before I could even finish, my food was ready. I eagerly grabbed the bag and went back upstairs to eat at my cubicle. 

I set the bag down and went to grab a glass of water, and when I returned, pools of oil were spotting my desk. Gross. I looked to see a corner of the bag leaking oil. I cleaned it up and set the food out, and learned the hush puppies were the culprit. SO FREAKIN GREASY. Like I seriously feel like I coulda squeezed some grease out of them if I had tried. EW. I love my fried food good and fried, and this was too much. I tried two and couldn&#39;t deal with the feeling it left on my mouth. Shame, too, because the sauce they come with is AHHHHHmazing and I totally used it to snarf my fries.

The slider was decent - I would probably order something different next time. A little bit dry, but pulled chicken is hard to do. I think I wanted it saucier or something. But the pretzel roll was delicious.  And the cheese fries were INCREDIBLE - they have the shape/size/texture of portillos fries, cooked perfectly, and drowned in a delightfully sinful cheesy sauce that has a hint of spice to it. I love, love, loved the fries and would totally order them again.

So one hit, one miss, and one meh leaves me feeling just all right about BTB. However, I&#39;m not giving up. Food trucks are novel and fun and their menu is expansive enough for me to give it another go - they&#39;ve got a bacon brownie on the menu and i can&#39;t let that go unreviewed!"

Initially, there was no website listed for this truck, so I googled it and I called the number listed.  The person at that number, very graciously, referred me to another number where I had to leave a voice message to get a return call. I went to the facebook page and posted a question about how to know where the truck might be BEFORE it actually left that sight.  Now they post the morning of, where they will be.  Sometimes I need more than 2 hours to figure out if the location will work for my schedule.  The person who called me back explained that she sometimes just puts the name of the building if she thinks that is better known than the actual address of the location.  I lived in Lisle for 20 years and NEVER heard of the building.

So, might I suggest, that you improve your website to make it legible, addresses help, and the correct times are a benefit.  The worker on the truck checked his personal calendar for July and told me they would not be in the area, most unfortunate.  The parking at this particular location in Lisle was akin to downtown Naperville.  Since everything is placed in a small bag, no larger bags are available ~ you might want to get some of those suckers~ I finally just went back to my car and drove over to the truck because there is no way I could have carried all those small bags in one trip AND unlocked my car.

My reward ~ the Interstate, Spare Tire, Jackknife, Speeding Ticket, and Traffic Jam were ALL faaaaaaaaaaaaabulously delicious.  That was lunch for 7 people, next time I know to order more of the Traffic Jam.

I will keep searching for this truck to be some place nearby because I WANT MORE."

We tried two different sandwiches, and agreed that both (Interstate and Expressway) were really good. A side of hush puppies made the meal, and their sauces are unique and memorable as well.

Overall I would go again.  I feel it deserves 3.5 stars but there is not a half star option."

I originally visited this place when it first opened, did not like it at all.  Went back last month and the food is amazing.  The waiter Kumar was great.  If you are going, ask for him.  He makes the experience great.  Great conversation, recommendations etc.  We went back few weeks ago, had a different waiter and she was horrible.  Took forever to get appetizers (we only got them because I went to Kumar and asked him why we haven&#39;t received them and we got them a few minutes later). I asked to have Kumar be our server, but it was too late.  The lady we had was disinterested, slow, and really felt like she didn&#39;t want to be there.

Tips: Ask for Kumar, he works daily except Tuesdays.  He will make your experience great.  Call ahead and make sure he is your server.
I would have given 5 stars, but the other server was bad."

I also ordered fish which seemed like it was fried first and than stir fried in that red sauce which they typically have on table for extra spicy taste.  I didn&#39;t enjoy my meal at all; hindsight - wine was excellent.  I guess that&#39;t the one thing on our table chef didn&#39;t make.

A very frequently visited joint for us, Bombay Chopsticks caters to the taste of all those who crave for Indo-Chinese cusine, as it is popularly termed in India. Their best to order starters are their Sesame toasts which do soak a bit more oil than usual but are worth the try. Their crispy corn also have been wonderful but we havent seen this on their recently upgraded menus. On their main course comes our favorite Schezwan fried rice that we customize to extra spicy owing to the craving spice levels we consume. An accompaniment to the fried rice is the veg balls in manchurian sauce which goes well with our second dish that we order i.e. Veg Chowmein. 
For all pregnant women who visit this place, be sure to ask them for a non-MSG food which they easily accommodate. 

Overall : A good value for money in an excellent ambient setting and good customer service minus the waiting time. Be sure to book ahead of time  if you are planning to visit this place in a group."

I wish they could open one is Milwaukee so I could go there more often. This is a Chinese/Asian fusion restaurant but all the food is cooked Indian style, so basically Indian Chinese. I went on a Saturday and it was very busy even at 10 in the night; the ambiance is beautiful, the servers are quick to attend, food could cost you $20 to $30 per head without the drinks. Most of the alcohol drinks are $12. They have a good variety of food items on the menu including Vegetarian, seafood and chicken and lamb; no beef items as it is an Indian restaurant. Some of them could be really hot and spicy(although they are marked on the menu). My advise, this is a must go place for everyone who loves Indian/Chinese food as the food tastes exactly or at least very close to the Chinese food we have in India."

Not knowing what to order, we had some chicken with spicy garlic sauce and lamb with sichuan sauce, i am a real chinese so the sichuan sauce wasn&#39;t as expected but good. I enjoyed the food while we were there( maybe i was really hungry?) but didn&#39;t feel well( not sick but didn&#39;t like the food&#39;d flavor anymore) for rest of the day, i didn&#39;t even tough any of the leftover.

The food was just A-OK. The green curry lacked a lot of flavor as well as some of the lamb dishes, however, the Chung King Lamb was fantastic, great with white rice. The lettuce wraps and crab had a flavorful taste, but nothing else really satisfied our taste buds.

Take note, don&#39;t come here expecting Chinese or Thai food though. 

With no surprise, Bombay Chopsticks puts the spices at the forefront of their cuisine due to the stronger Indian influence. Dishes here are much more vibrant and aromatic as with Indian cuisine but while still using Chinese cooking techniques. We ordered cumin lamb and dry chili chicken and both were excellent. Each dish was well prepared showing their skill and expertise in the cuisine. 

The food portions may be smaller than what I would have liked but we cleaned our plates. Just from trying two dishes, I want to go back and try more items off their menu."

I&#39;ve eaten this cuisine all around the country, but this is the closest you can get to the roadside-chinese food in India. Do not expect traditional thai or chinese food here, and don&#39;t even bother ordering those, but stick to what they do best.

Ambiance &amp; Service:
The place is decorated in a swanky fashion, with upholstered seating and chandeliers, which I thought was unnecessary and over the top. However, it does give a feel of a clean and well-kept place. The service was reasonably good, but a bit slow even for just a half-filled restaurant .

Food:
Excellent food, as I&#39;ve stated before. The spices they use are very aromatic, and much better than what I&#39;ve had at other similar restaurants.
We started off with soup, which we rarely get at restaurants. The sweet corn soup was very close to the indian version, but the manchow soup was clear, which was surprising, and also served without fried noodles. My friends got the chili chicken appetizer, which they said was really good.
For the entrees, we got gobi manchurian, hakka noodles, and shezwan fried rice. All of those were superb, and commendable. The noodles were the best among these. 
The quantity was really huge. Among the three of us, we could only eat 30% of what we got, and everything else was packed away to-go. 
They serve the food family style, so keep the large portion size in mind while ordering.

Value:
Even though the food was really good, it was pretty pricey relative to other comparable restaurant. For one appetizer, two soups, and three entrees, it cost us almost $110. 
However, this is a one of a kind place, so I won&#39;t mind splurging occasionally.

Saying this again, this is one of the best indo-chinese food I&#39;ve had in the US, and will definitely go back here.
If you go here, don&#39;t order the authentic chinese or thai dishes, but stick to the indo-chinese specialties."

A- mushroom and cottage cheese appetizers are better than all of the others veggie options.

B- I never had to wait for more than 15 minutes to get a table for 2.

C- Going by their menu, they use a lot of corn starch in almost every dish.
Once we ordered the veg manchow soup which was only starch with no soupy base. I had to convince them that it was no good.
Good thing that they offered us a fresh one which did taste like a real soup.

D- On another occasion, we ordered cauliflower manchurian with gravy which was so awful, no spice and flavor, just lot of starch again.

E- all in all, their food lacks consistency and flavor. And yes, it is a crowded fine dine place.

Hakka wok which is not so far from Bombay chopsticks is a better option when it comes to indo Chinese food."

We ordered 6 dishes for our group of 7 hungry folks which could have easily fed more than twice as many. The food was slightly Indo-Chinese fusion variety, different from standard Schezwan offerings yet well prepared.

We ordered chicken, lamb, and vegetarian dishes all were well received by the kids and adults. The calamari appetizer was good, but could have been great if it was slightly crispier.

This place provides a rather swanky ambiance for an Indo-Chinese place. Business must be great as it&#39;s next to the parent restaurant that owns it too in the plaza that&#39;s called India House plaza. 

The restaurant menu is very much set up as family style. Portions are made to be shared and priced as such. Food was okay. We liked the chicken Manchurian the most, and then the Chunking lamb and then the lobster crab dish. Everything we ordered came out record fast. If one takes a step back to see what was ordered, most of the protein dishes follow the same prep: batter it, color it, fry it, sauce it. 

There aren&#39;t other options for decent Indo-Chinese and esp. given the nice interior with a view of the cooks, I&#39;m sure this place has returning customers. I&#39;ll come back to try the Hakka noodles.

I am still giving this place 3 stars only because of the service provided at the bar before we moved to the table.

- Quick and friendly servers
- Accommodating to special requests
- Decor that makes one feel &#34;outside of the U.S.&#34; 
- Good appetizers to share amongst a small group (we were 5 people; worked well)
- Large portions for the main course (virtually no one finished their meal)
- Markings on the menu indicating level of spiciness - which matched people&#39;s expectations (meaning we all tried different levels - mild, medium, or hot - and got what we thought we would)

In addition to that, I always thought &#34;it&#39;s just Chinese food (I&#39;m half Chinese btw).&#34; However, on this 21st day of November, we decided it was going to be the day. 

It takes about 45-50 mins from Gurnee, but that was studying time we were willing to forego. As soon as I entered I said &#34;wow! This place is beautiful!&#34; The architecture, design, lighting, and entirety of its ambiance makes you feel at ease and delighted. 

We were seated immediately even though it was quite busy. We ordered the dragon roll appetizer within five minutes after being seated. It came out in minutes. Then for entrees we got the Chung king Lamb and the Mandarin Honey chili chicken which were both phenomenal. The food was sooooo sooooo soooo good. I liked the lamb better - they do a good job with the spices and breading. The serving sizes are humongous! You get your money&#39;s worth for sure. 

In addition to the food and ambiance, the service was superb too. Salu was our server and he was very kind to us. Very prompt and made it a great experience. Excellent service!

Bombay Chopsticks is bomb! Awesome and delicious food with a fun twist on Chinese cuisine! I recommend this for people because it&#39;s not your average Chinese restaurant!"

It&#39;s a Indo-Chinese place so basically they have Thai and Chinese food to the average American.  The food is reasonably priced. I&#39;d say $10-15 a plate but what they don&#39;t really tell you if that it is family style. My wife and I ordered the Lettuce wrap w/ chicken as an appetizer and then Pad Thai and Chung King Lamb and we left with 4 boxes of takeout :) 

This place is worth every penny. The atmosphere is really different and not what I expected. The main room is darker with some nice lighting and we sat in a room that had a wall of windows so it was bright but still nice.

But the kicker to our visit was the waiter. The lady hostess was nice but I don&#39;t think she completely understood us when trying to get a table/booth that our son (6-months) could fit at with his carseat. But it worked out for the best. Our waiter was Sukumar. He was soo nice and courteous. He was hard to understand some times but I wouldn&#39;t have had any other waiter. Every time he refilled my water he would ask if the food was to spicy for me in a joking way. He was super sweet to our son without going overboard. He was cracking jokes with us. When he was boxing up our food I started to wipe the table of the water condensation from my glass and he stopped me stating that if I clean the table then he will be out of a job and he will clean it. He was a gentle nice guy and I wouldn&#39;t have traded him for anyone else.

And free rice refills, can&#39;t beat that!

My experience might not be the same for everyone but if you do go ask for Sukumar and you will not regret it!!

Bombay Chopsticks has gained a loyal customer with me for sure!"

We are always looking for a place that serves good Indo- Chinese fusion food. Heard a lot about this restaurant but to say we were underwhelmed is putting it mildly. Have been here few times courtesy friends..But now never again..
The only dish worth getting here is Golden Baby Corn

The cauliflower manchurian , fried rice , noodles were nothing like Indo Chinese ! Flavorless 

Looks like this place manages to get a regular flow of customers because there are no other options in this neighborhood and they seem to be complacent since they don&#39;t have to compete.

Wish a new Indo Chinese restaurant opens up in the area and shuts this place down

My recommendation  - avoid this place."

Chicken Mancho soup - Flavourful. With the addition of the spicy dips, this soup was an ideal starter.
Lamb Patties in sweet sauce - Delicious Patty, cooked well. The party was juicy.
Dragon Chicken - This was a disappointment. Though the stuffing was light , the outer fried batter was way too oily. 
Egg Schezwan Fried Rice - Felt good about this dish. Good spicy rice and quantity was very generous.
Tiramasu-  Excellent rich tiramasu cake served with Vanilla and Mango icecreams."

The interior is well thought out and tastefully decorated with popular haute Asian themes.  The menus were plastic laminated traditional menus for an Asian restaurant but were held within custom fabric menu holders that added a nice touch in addition to the table cloth and napkins.

We were brought water promptly and we ordered soon after.  I ordered the Kung Pao Eggplant (Diced eggplant cooked with chopped Garlic, Chili, Green Onions,
and Peanuts) for $13.95.

My dish was incredibly delicious and the eggplant was prepared to the perfect texture and flavoring.  Eggplant is tough to cook with because it gets soft quickly with baking or sautéing but this was some of the best I&#39;ve had.  In addition this was fried so I was impressed.  The seasoning and spice was just right and the rice added a good balance.

One thing that drew me to this restaurant was the solid vegetarian menu.  Of course I would expect to find this at an Indian fusion restaurant, but they did a great job of combining the vegetarian staples of both cultures even within this menu as well.

I am disappointed that they serve Halal food at this restaurant.  I respect the Hindu practice of ahimsa or non-violence and for a restaurant with such an attractive vegetarian menu, I would prefer to support an establishment that didn&#39;t buy from Halal slaughter houses.

All in all, it is a great restaurant that you should check out!"

Service was outstanding. The servers know the menus and are very helpful. There were three of us dining. We skipped the appetizers and ordered entrees only. Mandarin Honey Chili Chicken, Chili Chicken and Pan Fried Orange Tilapia with Ginger, Garlic and Green Onions. All of this was served with a generous portion of steamed white rice and a variety of sauces.

I thought everything was good. In particular the Chili Chicken, although each dish had its own distinct flavor. Great food, a little pricier than other Asian restaurants in the area, but good ambiance for a special occasion."

I hesitated a bit writing a review based on take-out only especially this seems like a nice sit down restaurant but the food really did not live up to par for me to go back and try out the &#34;entire package&#34;. The food really was mediocre at best. 
We wanted to have Indian Chinese and decided to order the quintessential Indian Chinese preparations. 
We ordered manchow soup and ended up getting the egg flower soup in our take-out. The egg flower soup was watery and tasteless.
American Chopsuey - i personally dont like this preparation in general, i dont understand why any one would  like noodles drenched in ketchup. Anyway, my husband likes this dish, and he said Bamboo Chopstick&#39;s version was good.
Chili Chicken dry - this, I&#39;m sorry but is Not how chili chicken tastes. The chicken wasn&#39;t juicy, it was very very dry. It tasted a little bit like kung pao chicken without the peanuts. 
Schezwan chicken fried rice - this was a disaster! It literally tasted like frozen fried rice. The portion was huge!! But i couldn&#39;t keep the leftovers since it was tasteless and tasted like something that came out of a super market freezer section.
I hate to give two stars but i don&#39;t think the food at Bamboo Chopsticks qualifies to get more :("

Ambiance is cool, modern and elegant. Servers are excellent. 

Hot and sour soup had a surprising hint of curry which was in the background but not characterizing. Authentic ingredients but chicken was dry and inconsistent in sizes. Flavor was very good!!!

Garlic chicken noodles was excellent. It had excellent texture, crunchy with cabbage, hints of curry and had good spiciness. These are dry egg chow mien noodles that were gently stir fried and tossed in a garlic chili sauce. 

Kung Pao Chicken had a lot of chicken pieces diced in the correct dice size. The sauce was a little soupy and very salty. The flavor was good but needed more identity. 

The white rice was a premium long grain rice that was aromatic but slightly overcooked. 

I loved this place and was glad that India House was busy."

The food lost its flavor and the staff got worse. Fried rice and noodles were extremely oily. We actually had them take it back so they can re-heat it. I believe Chinese food is meant to be made instant, made to order. But the food that was brought to us came within 5-7 minutes, it did not taste fresh.

The pad Thai was not good ...actually tasted nothing like a pad Thai; also the noodles were very dry so we actually ended up returning the pad Thai. The waitress didn&#39;t really speak English and she hesitated at first (I guess she didn&#39;t know what to do) then she started insisting for us to get something else or for them to fix the pad Thai. We didn&#39;t want neither. Anyways, the drinks were ok I had ginger limeade and my friend had masala soda. This restaurant is ridiculously high priced I mean my ginger limeade non alcoholic was $10 wow! I mean it was just ginger and lemonade And the masala soda was $6 also, the spring rolls (3 rolls cut in half ) filled with cabbage and carrots was $10!

The only reason why I would not give this restaurant 4 stars is cause of the online reservation system. They are never able to deliver.

Their bar is beautiful and I love that you also glance into the cooking area. Their table setting and lighting was perfect, very comfortable.

Our waiter came and brought us water immediately after sitting and handed us the menu. We ordered drinks and mine was pretty good, I ordered the Raspberry Mojito and mine was a tad bit loaded with mint but not a big deal. My girlfriends were also pretty pleased with their drinks.

We placed ordered our food soon after and before we did our waiter told us that their portions were pretty big so we decided to do a family style so we can try different things. We ended up getting the Curry Chicken, Mango Chicken, and Teriyaki Chicken. We were pretty surprised and how HUGE their portions were and on top of that we got complimentary Orange Chicken.

For appetizers, we had chilli paneer and veg manchurian. They were good.

Then we had this eggplant entree prepared Singapore style which was great. The Paneer with Schzewan sauce was not very good. I thought the fried rice were pretty meh... I don&#39;t eat pasta, so I couldn&#39;t really eat the hakka noodles, but I did taste them and they seemed kind of bland.

The service was OK. There were six of us and we initially got seated in to strange atrium type room, which was kind of the border between this and India House. Did like it, and they accommodated us at another table which ended up being right next to the kitchen window. It was interesting, although you do constantly feel the heat of the theatrics...

The last 3-4 times I&#39;ve been here, it has been a huge disappointment, and sadly the food had been on the decline. The past few visits, the quality and taste of food has been largely compromised. For ex, today, the appetizers came literally within 3 minutes of ordering, which shows that obviously the appetizers were just reheated. We also ordered vegetable balls in schezuan sauce, which tasted like watered down soya sauce.  The main course which was chilli chicken, is the reason I am giving this place 2 stars. The fried rice arrived cold and oily to the table, which killed my mood as well my urge to eat. There are many other spots such as Inchin bamboo, which also happens to be in the same neighborhood. It has a lot more flavor, freshness and value for food and money. With much regret, I hate to inform I would not be coming back again even with the 15% off coupon I was given upon my next visit."

Heard a lot about this restaurant but to say we were underwhelmed is putting it mildly. The sweet corn soup and schezwan fried rice were semi decent. The chilli chicken was not bad but on the saltier side. The cauliflower manchurian was flavorless. Looks like this place manages to get a regular flow of customers because there are no other options in this neighborhood and they seem to be complacent since they don&#39;t have to compete.
I get that it is a business but cuisine should be more than just that - if you don&#39;t have a passion for serving food with finesse , why bother.
My recommendation , avoid this place."

0 for their food

Their food is extremely  over priced for what they serve.  I have been there several times and the last time was the worst.  I ordered manchow soup and what I got was corn soup with the red sauce mixed it.  I spoke to the server and she was so sure that this was manchow soup and said &#34;this is what the chef made.&#34; Long story short the chef comes out looks at the soup and asks the server what soup that was.  And finally admits &#34;oh yea this is corn soup.&#34;  

He said he would make me fresh soup but that was definately a lie  The new soup I got again was corn soup but now he just added tones of green onion.  

You can&#39;t keep a restaurant going with thinking your customers are fools.  And you can&#39;t keep an indo-chinese estaurant  going if you don&#39;t know the difference between manchow and corn soup.   

Improve your food.  Don&#39;t serve food that has the same base sauce or taste!"

Certainly much expensive Chinese. The menu could use more variety and I can&#39;t tell the difference from one curry to another. The portions have shrinked over a year and the delicacies needs a revival. Fish appetizers however always gets it right! Service is fine but there&#39;s always a waiting list at the entrance and it takes half an hour usually to get to the table.

I came here with a couple coworkers for lunch. It&#39;s a super cutely decorated restaurant. They have a pretty good selection on their lunch menu. All orders come with appetizers, soup and either steamed rice or vegetable fried rice. The waiter was nice and checked on us just enough. 

I wasn&#39;t exactly sure what the appetizers were or what the soup was. There was some sort of toast-type thing covered in maybe potatoes and sesame seeds, fried chow mein noodles (the type that sometimes gets added to salads) covered in some sauce and a vegetarian eggroll. The soup was good...it seemed like some twist on an egg drop soup.

I ordered the chicken thai curry, one guy got the double fried lamb and the last guy got a vegetarian meatball looking dish. The curry lacked flavor and had an odd consistency. I could smell the coconut and taste a little coconut but that was about all I really tasted. The lamb was really good though. A bit too spicy for my liking (sriracha is spicy for me if that&#39;s any reference). I didn&#39;t want to try the vegetarian meatballs but my coworker hated it. 

Next time, I&#39;d rather go to their sister restaurant next door (India House) for way better food!"

Obviously there is controversy as to wether Bombay chopstick serves Zabihah or not. I spoke to the Manager myself and they confirmed it, plus it&#39;s written all over the menus. Now I understand we all believe in different school of thoughts so it&#39;s okay to play it safe. If not for the meat go to Bombay Chopsticks for seafood, it&#39;s great! 

Seafood: 
For Starters

Changs King Shrimp (highly recommend)

Main course:

Chilli Fry Fish (It will melt in your mouth)
Spicy Szechuan Hakka Noodles with 
Shrimp (try it with mix of the Green chutney &amp; hint of vinegar)

Meat Lovers:
For Starters

Chicken Meatballs

Main course:

Changs King Chicken (ask for extra veggies)
Spicy Szechuan Hakka Noodles with Chicken 
Chilli Fry fish (Bare in mind I am not a huge seafood fan but this stuff is full of delicious Masalas, so give it a try)

Tip: Refrain from curries. I have tried just about all &amp; they were disappointing. 1/2 star off for this. The dry items here are so much better. 

The place loses another 1/2 star  due to the lack of attention from our server during my last visit. We were a big group but a restaurant running at this scale should be able to accommodate all their guest. 

May seem pricey at first but the portions make up for it. Love the ambience. Bombay Chopsticks has become our go to place for special family occasions. It also has great options for the more strict Zabihah eaters in our family."

4 stars for the food. It&#39;s excellent, but it&#39;s overpriced. So it loses a star.

0 stars for the service. It&#39;s miles away from what I expect from a restaurant charging $15-20 for an entree. Beware of the 18% gratuity added to bills of 5 or more guests. You&#39;ll wish you could tip much less!

2 stars for ambience. It&#39;s so cramped that you lose appreciation for the otherwise nice decor. There&#39;s a good chance that your chair will be backed right up against another patron...literally! It&#39;s ridiculous and awkward. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.

The restaurant itself is dimly lit and quite beautiful. It&#39;s nicely decorated and has an area where you can look into the kitchen and watch the food being prepared.
The food was very good. We got the chicken satay, assorted soups, I got the lemon coriander with chicken- it&#39;s tangy and spicy with a clear broth it pretty good my friends got the sweet corn and I tried some it was too sweet for my tastes.  We got for the main course: jumbo kung poa shrimp- spicy and good served with a thick gravy orange chicken- not sweet and if you get a pepper watch out! very spicy it. We felt the chicken was coated with too much breading and that there wasn&#39;t enough chicken to being with. The flavor was still good though. and finally a mixed noodle dish that was just so -so nothing to write home about.
The service was very nice but they were very busy so it just took a bit longer to get things going. 
The seating was a little uncomfortable, it&#39;s very close quarters at least where we were seated and you could hear other people it was pretty unpleasant. Also in silverwear they only give you a spoon, fork, and chop sticks. There were a lot of items that needed to be cut but you don&#39;t get a butter knife so I found this annoying.  Also the water is served room temp. We had to constantly ask our waiter for ice, it would be nice if they would ask you if you wanted ice or not instead of assuming that you did not.
Finally, on a price point it&#39;s not cheap, ~$16 per dish. All in all I think it&#39;s a neat idea, especially if you have someone who is only interested in indian food but you want them to try something different."

Got disappointed the first time so I decided to try it again, but it is still terrible so I am not going back. 
Service is bad when it gets busy. Fancy ambiance if you want to walk in, see the place and walk out... which I highly recommend doing unless you want a bad dining experience. The booth is so tiny and the tables are so little that you should be ready to juggle your plates and practice on efficient use of space during your dinner.

I&#39;ve been here plenty of times over the years in the hopes that it would be as good as the ONE time it actually was. 

I&#39;ve gone from hopeful to disappointed to actually enraged. My two biggest problems is that everything is overpriced and that they don&#39;t know how to season chicken. 

My last time there, they had a shortened menu with about 1/4 of what they typically offer and the food was still horrible. 

Save yourself the misery and go to Hakka Wok or Chef Ping instead."

I ate here for the first time this week.  Then I also ate here for the second time this week.  I have passed by this place for a few years when I would visit Tiger Direct across the street.  The place always looked to have a good size crowd.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this was Indian food or Chinese food.  I have never ate Indian food so I always decided against eating here.  

Finally one day I saw their billboard on I-90 &amp; decided I should give it a try.  My friend &amp; I came here during lunch hour on one of the coldest days of the year.  I soon found out that it was mainly Chinese food with an Indian twist.  I was not disappointed.  

The lunch specials come with appetizers &amp; entrees for around $9.50 - $10.50.  I ordered the chicken in szechuan sauce &amp; requested it extra spicy.  My friend ordered a vegetarian dish.  He also asked if their noodles in that vegetarian dish were made from egg because he was fasting from dairy &amp; they told him that they weren&#39;t so it worked out for him.  

For appetizers they told us we had a choice of soup either chicken or vegetable.  We ordered the vegetable soup.  It came out with an egg roll another side which I wasn&#39;t sure what it was because it was small &amp; a side of what looked like cabbage in sweet &amp; Sour sauce.  The soup was awesome, I really liked it.  The cabbage in sweet &amp; Sour sauce along with the other side that I wasn&#39;t sure what is was tasted phenomenal.  

I was very impressed with the appetizers.  Next the entrees came out.  At first I though the portion looked small but I soon found out it wasn&#39;t.  It probably just looked like that because of the bowl it was in.  I could only eat half of the entree because I was so full.  The chicken in szechuan sauce &amp; white rice was also excellent.  

My experience here was very good &amp; it was refreshing to find a new restaurant that I really enjoyed.  I enjoyed this place so much that I came back the next day again for lunch.  I will definitely be eating here again."

Expensive for what they serve, considering I don&#39;t think anything was that special. Better way to put it is I know my mom could make anything that was there very easily. I think that matters. 

The chili chicken was okay, almost too much sauce IMO. The chicken was pretty flavorless without the sauce and vegetables. Same with the paneer, was expecting that to be better. The best dish we had was the crispy shredded beef. That portion was hugeeee. I really like the texture and it had the most unique flavor. We also had the noodles, which were nothing special. I liked the sweet and sour soup with chicken. Egg rolls were okay.

Anyhow, we ordered chicken manchurian, chicken fried noodles, chicken drumsticks (only decent thing but was mostly bones, no meat!), and hot and sour soup. Chicken manchurian looked like soup with floating chicken pieces, the sauce itself was tasteless. Noodles weren&#39;t anything special, I found myself adding the side sauces to every dish for flavor. Soup was nothing noteworthy. We barely ate much and left the place with empty stomachs and aching wallets. The service was really good and our server actually gave two my friends free soup when I only ordered it for myself. But based on their prices and food quality I will never go there again."

Before my husband called to place our order, I was having second thoughts about this place, but quickly brushed off the doubts. I should have followed my intuition, especially after it kept tugging at me while my husband placed the order. Please note, my soup dish comes with avocado automatically, so no need to ask for it. Order placed. Next, enchiladas generously portioned at 4 per entrée. We requested half to be topped with red sauce and the other half with green. No can do implied the lady taking the order. Okay, we didn&#39;t ask why, nor was a reason provided. No problem, let&#39;s cooperate and sure, the green sauce is fine on the side. Next order are the tacos, and we&#39;d like to add avocado. No, can&#39;t do that either. Oh by the way, there is no cheese for the enchiladas tonight.  Seriously?  The lady then said that we can put sour cream on top.  I surprised myself for keeping my frustration under control as I listened to this discussion.  Thinking about it... &#34;okay, no problem about the cheese&#34;, says my daughter. But wait, no avocado?  We know to expect an extra charge, so my husband probes for an explanation. No avocado tonight. No cheese, no avocado at a Mexican restaurant?  We should have stopped there, but I wanted to know why the lady did not mention that they did not have avocado when it&#39;s an automatic part of my dish, which we ordered first.  My husband relays the question to the lady and he was told that I would get the avocado, but he would not. Apparently, they didn&#39;t have enough for extra orders, but momentarily after that, the lady told us that someone was coming in (from the store we assume) with cheese and avocado. Lucky for us we thought, so we dismissed the entire incident, and proceeded with the order.  I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately, the food was not good.  The soup was very salty, at least for my taste. My daughter could only finish a couple of her enchiladas, because the ground beef filling was dry and tasteless, and the sauce was too spicy (and we do like heat).  My husband only finished one of the three tacos, because the pork was a little too sweet and it did not taste fresh.  This is the first time that we all stopped eating halfway through our meals.  I wish I could say that it was just an off night for us and we will give it another try.  But, my intuition is telling me otherwise, and this time, I&#39;m going to trust what I&#39;m feeling."

I ended up taking all the beef and bacon out, The half or third that was left was very nice. Good broth. But not worth 10 bucks for what I ended up with.

I have to say, the food was not great. The al pastor was somehow both greasy AND dry. The beans had very little flavor, I had to salt them to make them palatable. My girls ate the rice though and my older one liked her carne asada well enough. 

If the other reviewers are right, it sounds like there&#39;s been a management or ownership change and the food has gone downhill. Maybe it was just the night I went though. For their sake, lets hope so. I&#39;d really like to have a good Mexican place close to home. I&#39;d recommend going to Las Asadas over by the original McDonald&#39;s for really great food, even if it&#39;s a divey atmosphere."

Seems management has changed or recipes have been downgraded. I always get the carne asada dinner and it&#39;s always good. They have since cut down the size of their steak in half, also guacamole no longer is included (even though the menu still lists it as part of the $12 dinner). The server was not busy but still delayed in bringing basic things like a lime for our beers or napkins! Then my friend orders a vegetarian torta and gets a bread with lettuce and two think slices of tomato! My girlfriend walked out and waited in the car when I asked for the check, they took 20 minutes to bring us a check.

I&#39;ve been here twice in 1 week because it&#39;s that good. They do have awesome specials, but I chose my platters based on the pictures I saw in the menu. Everything looks and sounds so delicious. The first time I came here, I ordered #5. It was the Tampiquena dish, which consisted of: beans, rice, steak, guacamole, enchilada, and homemade corn/flour tortillas garnished with 2 jalapeños, tomato, lettuce, cucumbers, and orange slices. Two days later, I had the #3 dish which was just as tasty. Came with the same items as above, but no enchilada and the steak was much thinner. They do serve you freshly baked tortilla chips with a spicy, green salsa and 2 condiment containers of hot sauce once you&#39;re seated. The guacamole and chips dish was also fantastic. You can definitely tell it was made fresh and the cilantro is a nice touch to the dish. 

The employees are very friendly and accommodating. Once you enter, you can seat yourself and the waitress greets you with menus. Our waitress was able to split our bill 4 ways even though we forgot to tell her we wanted individual checks prior to our meal. 

The space is comfortable and clean. They play Spanish music in the background, which makes the experience great. Bathrooms are clean and well kept. 

Overall, this restaurant is a hidden gem in the northwest suburbs and I&#39;m glad they are close by. I&#39;d definitely frequent this place a couple of times a month or even more! I&#39;d give this place 100 stars if I could."

When I brought the carry out home mine was filled with meat , he had barely any meat and no tortillas. I called to let them know and lady who answered the phone stated bring the entire order back because I accidentally placed someone else&#39;s guacamole order in your bag. There was no guacamole in my bag . I brought the bag back . Without the guacamole (I never seen this guacamole) she kept insisting I had the guacamole &#34; I placed it in your bag , my cook saw me&#34; on and on . I was so frustrated I asked for a refund . I DIDNT STEAL GUACAMOLE . Overall the food is decent , small portions, horrible customer service.

I will not order at a taqueria that does not offer lingua, which makes up the worlds best taco (IMHO. This is a sign of authenticity for me. And it can be done badly, but not here. Always delicious, tender and juicy.

My standard order in a taco stand like this is a chorizo burrito w/o rice + extra letttuce and 2 lingua tacos. It is always done just right at this place.

You can find authentic, but the quality is sub-par.  Just down the street from our house, this new place opened a few days ago.  I&#39;m a big supporter of local business, so I had to check it out.

The restaurant has nice improvements compared to the restaurant that was there before.  Better than the scenery is the food!  QUALITY, AUTHENTIC Mexican food, at last!  We had an asada (steak) burrito and an asada taco dinner.  The steak has a very tasty, well charred taste.  Unlike the other restaurants in the vicinity (El Famous Burrito for one) the asada is not overly fatty, not salty, and not greasy.  I was impressed on the first bite!  The portions are plenty.  The price was surprisingly cheap too!  3 steak taco dinner, rice and beans for $5.99.  Steak burrito with plenty of meat for $5.50!  Size up to that Chipotle!

The staff were polite, young, and energetic.  The menu is also authentic, en espanol!  If you can&#39;t read spanish, the staff were ready to explain everything.  

Only negative comment is the menu is a bit small right now, but for a restaurant only open for 5 days, I&#39;d give them a break.

As delicious as my food was, I am only giving Mi Ristorante 4 stars, as I am pretty sure it caused my diarrhea that night.

I was quoted 15 minutes for my meal to be ready and it took 25 minutes so I waited for 10 minutes which eats into the half hour lunch I get.

There&#39;s not a lot of these in the area, and I&#39;ve been to a nearby church for years, and didn&#39;t realize there was one so close to take my lil monsters too. So this was a nice pleasant surprise when I found this place. Service was excellent and they got our order quick and accurate. If you&#39;ve never been to a Steak N Shake before, milk shakes are what makes Steak N Shake shine, IMHO. You can mix and match different shake flavors and top em off with candy such as M&amp;Ms. Overall, a great place to take kids during the weekend because kids eat free with every adult order. Score, for this cheap bastard!

BATHROOM REVIEW: the men&#39;s has one urinal and steal. The stall was somewhat rickety, but I guess it gets the job done. A little grimy, but then again, Steak N Shake is a place opened 24/7. Sit or squat? Squat."

I had an Egg Nog Milk Shake in the spirit of the season- That was excellent- Had a cup of chili ..god awful, seemed like it came right out of a can, just a bowl of muck.  Had a triple with cheese, I didn&#39;t want french fries- but our waitress sent them along anyway- I had a few, they were greasy, thin, tasteless and what I expected, and why I didn&#39;t order them to begin with- I think I was charged for them, but the whole triple with fries was still less than 5 bucks, so who cares?  

Our waitress was young, and she tried real hard, but I don&#39;t think she has a future as a waitress, I asked for the chili, first, before the burger...that was reversed..As it turns out, as mentioned before, the chili was so bad, it didn&#39;t matter, only ate half of it.  I also had to ask her a 2nd time after the food arrived, for my milk shake.

The burger was just average at best.  I think for burgers and fries, along the same line- Culver&#39;s blows away S n S 

A table across the way, sent their order back.  I don&#39;t think I will be rushing back to Steak n Shake for sit down service, they have an excellent drive thru, most locations and the half price milk shake offer 2-5 can&#39;t be beat!"

Costs: 
Classic milkshakes are cheaper than the special milkshakes (ex: s&#39;more milkshake or something)..ranges from $4+ for a decent portion..more than enough sugar/calories than you may need in one day...and the food food costs are reasonable...

I can find the shake, but where&#39;s the steak! The whole concept of premium steak in my burger was novel back 5 years ago before premium angus burgers started to hit the menu at McD. I use to crave coming to steak and shake to eat there steak burgers and always would leave wondering why my experience is so so. Most likely because the steak burgers themselves are very thin minced up patties of unrecognizable beef with a super lightweight burger bun. The pictures sell you on the most wonderful burger but really the burger itself is worse than McD. I would always get the burger dinner combo which is not on the menu and comes with 2 sides. I ended up getting onion rings which were over fried that the rings themselves look dark brown and shoe string fries that tasted off. Maybe it is something with the oil. Now there is ONE positive and that would be the wonderful milk shakes at steak n shake. I can&#39;t say I have ever had a bad milk shake here. The double chocolate fudge was perfect with rich chocolate milk shake and fudge throughout. I should just come here for the milk shakes!

Pro- best milk shakes in the world! friendly service

But Peter B. is right, this Steak n Shake (as most) does seem to attract a really odd collection of patrons.  High school kids, hometown people back for the holidays (AKA me), and random old people that probably go there every day for the early bird.

My absolute favorite is the Frisco Melt.  I can&#39;t even begin to really describe it properly - I drool just thinking about it.  Steakburger with &#34;Thousand Island dressing&#34; (it doesn&#39;t really taste like Thousand Island - it&#39;s BETTER), and a big layer of melted cheese.  It&#39;s an orgasm between two slices of bread.  I also like their shoestring fries, and of course, the requisite shake (made with real milk and ice cream).

I&#39;ve never had a problem with service here.  The servers do look like they&#39;re annoyed when there&#39;s a particularly large group of people, but I&#39;m sure I would be annoyed too.  After your meal, don&#39;t sit around waiting for your server to take your money - you pay for your check up at the counter.  Num num, definitely an old standby when I go back home!"

I ordered one of the specialty burgers -- the Guacamole Steak Burger.  I can&#39;t say enough about this burger... it was DELICIOUS.  All the included condiments were SPOT ON.  There was a little bit of lingering spiciness in each bite.  Not sure if this was from the pepper jack cheese or the guac (maybe both?), but it was just the right level of spice to push what would probably be a standard burger up a notch.  The red onion was the clincher for me.  I love onions, and had they used white onions instead of red, it would have ruined the burger.

I noticed on the menu that they are also featuring a guacamole hot dog.  I&#39;ll have to try this next time.

Without a doubt, I would go back again for another guacamole steak burger.  YUM!"

The server walked us to a table and tried to seat us at a table that had 3 dirty plates and 3 empty used cups. Obviously the server was not going to sit us there so she sat us at another table. We ordered our drinks and our food at the same time. As time passed, 5 mins or so I finished my drink and waited for another refill. That took about another 10 mins. Steak n Shake had maybe 4 other tables at this time (remember I said I was late, around 2am) and my guest an I noticed there was 11 dirty tables! 11! ELEVEN DIRTY TABLES! I was disgusted and grew super impatient of waiting for our food (about 30-35 mins after our order was took). I walked up to the front desk and asked what is taking sooooo long. A woman who was not doing much work nor working hard threw her hands in the air and shouted &#34;The drive thru, the drive thru!&#34; She was very rude and unprofessional! My guest and I didnt see a line of cars in the drive thru. We seen 2 the whole visit! Before our food came out and to our table wr said we are leaving and we stood up to walk out. We then were yelled at and were told we had to pay for everything we ordered! I got pissed because all we got were 2 drinks and I cup of chilli, never got our main meal! I said we will pay for what we recieved and what we ate. &#34;Nope, you have to pay for everything and we are calling the police, said the rude manager. My guest ended up paying for everything as I waited out side foe the police who were supposedly called to arrive. As I waited I watched as a crew of people, who were not present when we were ready to dine, SCRAMBLE to clean the tables. 
I waited and waited but no police showed up. I will Never, Ever go to this place ever again! The staff was unprofessional and hiding and lazy. One man I seen working, he was on the grill. I praised him as we walked out.

EDIT (9/4/2007): I have dropped my rating from 3 stars down to the minimum 1 star.  This is due to a recent bad dining experience on 9/3/2007 which included the following sucky things:

* Served an iced tea with crap floating in it because the ice tea maker wasn&#39;t cleaned for over 24 hours.  Although, I suspect my waitress spat in it as well as other food items which were served at my table.
* My party was served cold soup and half of the cups were less than half full.
* Our waitress only stopped at our table 2 times during the meal: to take our order and to deliver our food and check.
* Overcharged for meals, staff had attitude of &#34;So what... Up yours&#34; when asked to make corrections.
* Tables and seating dirty and sticky since staff wasn&#39;t properly cleaning up after people left.
* No receipt issued upon payment.

The list above has been reported to SNS corporate offices, and a conversation is pending with the district manager.  I do not plan on returning to this location.

EDIT (10/1/2007):
The district manager has not gotten back to me yet, even though I have given second notice to corporate.

EDIT (12/3/2007):
The district manager finally contacted me during the week of 10/8 and apologized for the incident.  The district manager had the third shift of this location purchase and send me a $25 gift card as well as apologize in writing for the incident.  

Due to honesty as well as the apology of the district manager, I have restored my original 3 star rating."

It saddens me to write this because I used to love &#34;My Halal Meat&#34; a few years ago, and would even drive out 20 miles each way to patronize this meat shop. However, things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse over the last few years.

First of all, the meat isn&#39;t as fresh tasting as it used to be; it could be because the turnaround/sales are not as frequent which leads to vicious circle of having to hold on to meat longer and eventually selling it to the customers days later.

Recently my wife ordered a couple lbs of goat meat, which is pricey at almost $10/lb, but in reality we ended up paying way more. Majority of what she brought home was bones. Yup, I don&#39;t mean 20% or 30% of the weight was bones... I mean about 60% of the weight was bones. Moreover, we weighted the packet at home (with the bones) and it was nowhere close to the 2 lbs we paid for (closer to 1.3 lbs). I am convinced this has become the normal dishonest practice at this business based on other reviewers I&#39;ve recently read on Yelp.

When my wife did call back and challenged the store on the lesser product we received, she was given some nonsense story about &#34;oh well, we trimmed it (even though that was never discussed with us) so the weight went down&#34;. The truth is trimming the fat reduces the weight in an already lean cut by less than 10%, not by dramatic amounts as in our case. Resultantly, we ended up paying about $16-$17 for average to below average quality goat meat; That is a travesty.

We will never patronize the business again, which is tragic because we liked the owner, who is charming and engaging. But no value in that if his business is dishonest."

The owner (ayaz) is a con man. He takes your order very quickly so as to confuse you. Then he quickly cuts and packs the meat and you never get a chance to inspect it.

1) the meat is always under weight (he will say it&#39;s 5 ibs but usually shorts you by a ib or so

2) he ALWAYS overcharges per pound. He charges $10-12 / ib for goat. Are you kidding me???? I would rather go to whole
Foods and get fillet for that much.

He is a hypocrite and pretends to be a pious Muslim while he steals from his customers. There are so many other places to shop for good meat in Schaumburg and the surrounding areas.

I would recommend you avoid this place at all costs even if that means you have to drive a few miles more for another spot.

Anyways, the customer service is great. I sometimes call in to tell them what I want and then pick it up later and they have it ready and packaged for me.

I am here because I absolutely love Italian Subs. I really wanted to test this place out when I saw this place passing it up. 

First - I like how you pick out a bag and check all the things you want on a sandwich. Very clever.

Second - I like how they categorize the menu. So, for example, under  seafood you can get a tuna sandwich, crab salad sandwich, surf and turf sandwich, etc. Clever. Easier to choose your sandwiches.

Third - The Small Grinder is 7 inches. So one  of those is good enough for me. 

Total cost for a small sandwich, chips, and a regular fountain drink was 9.71.

Negatives - Again they just opened so giving them the benefit of the doubt. But they were a bit slow making my sandwich. Maybe it&#39;s because they were heating up my sandwich. Service was still awesome. No I am sure there was a reason for it.

Also no combo meals.&#34; Deals. Sort of odd of a sandwich shop. Never seen that before and I go to many sub shops.

I will definitely come back again to test out the other Italian Sub options here. 

I took a pic of the menu so I hope this helps."

You first look at what type of meat you want then find the bag with the meat that you and then you can read and mark what you want on the bag. When you have marked all that you want on a the bag you can bring it to the cashier and they ring you up and you wait a couple minutes for them to make your sandwich for you.

I got 2 sandwiches
The gyro sandwich with classic onions and tomato, was very good it was comparable meat and sauce to a real classic gyro.

The other sandwich i got was a roast beef with pepperjack cheese, honey mustard,regular mayo, crispy strings (fried onions), lettuce, spinich, tomatoes, pickles, house chip (not sure what they were or if they even were in there), mushrooms, oregano,garlic,salt, and pepper.    This one was bigger than the gyro cuase it had way more stuff in it. It also was a great sandwich  and everything tasted fresh.

Overall i think this is a good place to eat at, comparable to jimmy johns but with more cuatomizable."

Came in here during a lunch hour and totally expected to be overwhelmed cause I had looked at the menu online and it seems very extensive.  Now, is it as easy as Subway or JJs?  No, but you have awesome selections and the food is insanely fresh.  You order your type of sandwich by first picking out what kind of meat you want, then you can add toppings, make it skinny, pick out your sammy style (bread, bowl, or lettuce), and then you hand the cashier your marked up bag.  

Each employee was super helpful and friendly.  My chicken pesto was really good -- as I said before, everything is really fresh.  I opted to not have my sammy warmed up, so I enjoyed how each bite had a snap to it.

I had the gyro and I can honestly say it wasn&#39;t bad at all! I got the 10&#39; with no chips or drink and still paid 9.50 so I wasn&#39;t too thrilled about that, especially when I could&#39;ve gotten a burger and bottomless fries at red robin (next door) for $10.

There is no combo option, the ridiculously high priced chips and drink come at a hefty cost (almost $4 if you want both) and no discount for getting both as opposed to most other Sandwich places. 

The sandwich was good, I ate it all and was full but it didn&#39;t knock my socks off or make me want to go back in a hurry for more. I think I honestly would be perfectly fine if I never went back (this was my second time)

The sauce on the gyro was pretty good and comparable to actual gyro sauce (the white colored cucumber sauce i don&#39;t know how to spell it) 

Overall if you are into sandwiches this place has a ton of options, is fast and taste pretty good, but for $9 and no chips or drink it seems a bit overpriced."

Be careful though when you order sauces as I ordered only light mayo and dijon on my sandwich and when I got home and unwrapped my sandwich to eat, it was soggy and oozing with the sauces! I could barely eat it I had to take a napkin and wipe of so much sauce. 

A little on the pricey side. My fiance ordered a large Italian sub and I ordered a medium tuna and the total was around $21.00 not including chips or drinks. 

There was one lady working there and I looked at her name tag her name is Emma. She made being there waiting for our sandwiches super uncomfortable. They close at 9pm and we got there around 8:30pm. When we walked in she was sweeping and seemed like she was extremely unhappy about it and unhappy that we walked in. She was banging the broom around so loudly and shoving the chairs everywhere. As she was sweeping she was talking to another employee about her personal life and everyone in the restaurant could hear it. She would give us a couple glances that did not look friendly. Not very professional.

I recommend ordering their pizza, or if you&#39;re in the mood for a lighter dish, a salad. I&#39;ve found their entrees aren&#39;t great. Another thing my family enjoys is the lettuce wraps (we get them with chicken and shrimp). Their pizza crust is delicious, and almost makes you want to get something fancier than a cheese or pepperoni.

You get three choices (in the GF world, that&#39;s a lot!!). They clearly label their menu. This location I have visited many times. They have a typical indoor dining room for the chain, and some outdoor seating right next to the train tracks (can be fun if you have kids). There seems to be a new and very attentive manager working here. Maybe some of the service problems others have noted will get fixed.

The place wasn&#39;t full, and there were plenty of staff (many of whom weren&#39;t doing much) but they just aren&#39;t good at handling big parties.

On Valentines day there was a wait, but it was bearable! We waited about 20/25 minutes to be seated. However on a Thursday afternoon around 2o&#39;clock, we were seated immediately! 

Every time I come here the waitress is super nice, as well as the chef. Our waitress would check on us from time to time and the chef came our once as well! Very polite and good service

 The garlic creme fettuccine with shrimp and mushrooms was very good and very filling, even difficult too finish! But again delicious. Portions are generous, especially the salads; you will not have to worry about leaving hungry if you do order one!

From the Lite Menu, the cedar plank salmon is SO good! Perfectly cooked and the corn side salad goes along perfectly. Squeeze a little lemon juice on and it is finger licking good!"

Obviously, I still ate half and had the second half for Thanksgiving breakfast.  It was great reheated!

Our waitress was great.  My dad made some awkward comment (not to or about said waitress) and she just went right along with it and kept the conversation flowing while I turned red and buried my face into my hands.

I love CPK, but from my experience the Deer Park location is slightly better.  I also think the Deer Park location is a little cheaper, but don&#39;t quote me on it.

They have a patio area for warmer days and nights.  If you plan on sitting inside, you should bring a sweater because the air is on full blast making it chilly!

*Asparagus + Arugula Salad is one of my go-to small plate starters.  Chopped up asparagus mixed together with arugula, toasted almonds, and sun-dried tomatoes.  The salad is tossed with a lemon vinaigrette and then topped off with shaved Parmesan.  A perfect light start.

*Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza is one of my faves.  It now comes on the thin crust, but I usually ask for it to come on the original honey wheat crust.  Slices of Bosc pears cover the crust with sweet caramelized onions and hazelnuts.  They top the pizza off with field greens that have been tossed in a tasty Gorgonzola ranch dressing.  It&#39;s almost like a salad on your pizza.  Give it a try!

When coming to the downtown Arlington Heights location, you have to go in knowing that this place is pretty much run by female servers under the age of 22.  The service is always mediocre.  The food is usually consistent...the service not so much.

They have recently switched up their crusts so pay attention when ordering.  Many pizzas now come on a thin crust and others with a new hand tossed style.  The past 3 times when ordering take out we&#39;ve specifically asked for and described one crust just to receive another.  Mama Mia!  What&#39;s a girl to do?!

Last week, we had a negative experience.  I had ordered a salad for my dinner.  While collecting my roasted vegetables and lettuce onto my fork, I noticed a long strand of BLACK hair intertwined within my fork and veggies.  Our servers hair was a light brown and was pulled back in a braid so I didn&#39;t think it was hers by any means, but it definitely belonged to someone else who had their hair dancing over my salad.  I tried looking to the kitchen to see if I noticed anyone with long hair.  The only one I could really see was another server with black hair prancing around the kitchen to help out.   She had her hair half up, with tightly hair-sprayed ringlets hanging on each side of her face.   I brought the hair to my servers attention at the end of our meal (because that&#39;s when she checked back with us).  She agreed it was gross and said she would bring it to the managers attention.  Minutes later she returned with to go boxes for us and our check.  No mention of the hair again.  Now, I&#39;m never looking for a hand out, but you&#39;d think the manager would come by to apologize or they would offer to re-make my salad, rather than assuming I want to take it home and munch on some more hair of a stranger.  Well, at least it wasn&#39;t something worse like a booger or a finger nail."

It was 4:00 pm on a Saturday when we came in. We were sat without utensils to eat with. Our server didn&#39;t bring out my soup before our meal. We had to ask for drink refills and our food took forever. There were 2 other tables in the restaurant. Worst part - we had to eat amongst a sea of dirty dishes. Our table wasn&#39;t cleared once throughout our meal. Gross!! And our waitress would just walk by.

My waitress (Teresa) only visited my table two times in the entire evening. She served my family stale hard, crusty bread as an appetizer, didn&#39;t re-fill our drinks, and never came to our table to check on how we were doing.

We were seated immediately upon arrival. It was around 6:30 on a Friday night with no wait. Our waitress was very nice and kept checking on us throughout our meal. When our order arrived, our server told us he had dropped one of the tortilla spring rolls and that another order had already be placed. One order of spring rolls comes split into 3 pieces. Only one of the pieces had dropped, but we were given a new full 3 piece roll.

We ordered the Baja Chicken and Thai Chicken Tortilla Rolls. Both were good, especially with the side dips: guac and peanut sauce, respectively. I would get the Baja Chicken again (because I liked the guac) and give the Mediterranean Veggie a try the next time we are at CPK. We also had the Shaved Mushroom and Spinach Flatbread (enjoyed/would get again), and the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza (nothing too special about that one though). This was dinner for 2 and we had leftovers enough for a one person lunch.

There is ample free street parking and would like to try the outdoor seating sometime. This location is right next to the Metra tracks. However when a train did pass by during our dinner, we did not really hear it while seated inside the restaurant."

I ordered the Jambalaya which came with noodles instead of rice.  It wasn&#39;t all that great if you ask me. A bit spicy but other than that, kinda bland.

If you like pizza, they have options.

Is it the best food I&#39;ve taken down? Nope. No way. 
Is it somewhere a little different that offers really good service at pricing even to the other places nearby? Yes. You betcha!

So often I go with the routine - the buffalo chicken pizza (because it tastes so good). This time around, the wife and I went for something new - lettuce wraps and the cheeseburger pizza.

I was weary of the wraps before they arrived at our table. Once they touched down, my weariness went out the door. They were good. Surprisingly good. We scarfed them with no problem.

Then came our riskier choice, the cheeseburger pizza. The only way to describe its taste is like this -- do you like the whopper with cheese from Burger King? If you said yes than this is the pizza for you. Even down to a &#34;secret sauce&#34; it tasted like Whopper Pizza. That&#39;s not bad or good...just what it was. I wish the meat tasted more high quality than Burger King meat but it was as advertised. Flame-broiled pizza.

We avoided dessert (because we pigged out on everything else).
Lastly, I wish I could remember our server&#39;s name. She was really attentive, even on a slammed Friday night.

We&#39;ll keep going back because we like pizza and good service. Win, win."

We got seated fairly immediately. Right after getting seated, I went to the bathroom, and my friend went to the bathroom. In that time, no server had visited our table to greet us. When a server finally did arrive, she seemed a little frantic, it seemed that a miscommunication had occurred about who would be taking care of us. Not a huge deal to us. 

However, that apparently was so much of a blunder that the manager visted our table and comped our whole meal. He even requested that we have dessert as their treat. The server that took care of us was wonderful: we&#39;re fans of the recently-retired BLT Pizza and she requested the kitchen make it even though it was off the menu. She also recommended an excellent salad for me. 

Food was great! Everything tasted wonderful. 

Not many restaurants I&#39;ve visted would take the fault for such a minute error, let alone comp a whole meal to gain a customer&#39;s satisfaction. I was very impressed and appreciative of the manager and server. Outside of a tip, the least I can do is write a favorable review and revisit to bring them more business. Bravo, AHCPK!"

The best part is the variety they offer.  Basically any type of pizza you could possibly want, they have.  However, they won&#39;t be the best you&#39;ve had.

I had a Hawaiian pizza, which was good.  The pineapple was fresh and the cheese ample.  But it was missing that good ham that makes a Hawaiian pizza.

They did offer delicious raspberry-lemonade and strawberry-lemonade, which I would get again.

That is, if I go.  The price was a little to step to not try and find a better pizza in the area with a bit more character and a little less dough, no pun intended.  (These pizzas barely have any.)"

My daughter Erika and I had never tried CPK but our friends had recommended it highly.,This is largely because of the always delicious food!   Erika and I
enjoy the barbecue pizza and the avocado rolls...  and one really special waiter.

 Fernando makes dining a pleasure from beginning to end. He is friendly,respectful, personable, efficient and always makes great suggestions. Last night he called our attention to a placard suggesting a red wine where some proceeds go to a heart association. Wow he had us! Erika turned 21 just two days before and there was something very special to celebrate! Last year Dr. Bakhos of Loyola University Medical Center replaced her aortic valve due to a congenital problem with aortic valvar stenosis.  The heart healthy drink seemed appropriate. Later, we chose a shared slice of refreshing key lime pie; what a treat!!

The first time we had the pleasure of having Fernando as our waiter, he ended the meal by fashioning a rose out of a napkin. Such a kind thank you and so welcome!.The time was emotional yet Erika left smiling at the unexpected sweet ending to some time alone with mom.

Now I have four children and a granddaughter ...so of course everyone wants this wonderful dining experience; kudos to the chefs too because we love the food as well!!! We look forward to our next visit and consider Fernando a dear friend of the family for making some moments of a very busy/crazy life moments to remember.

Not a one knew what they were doing and it was obvious from the get go. Our waitress greeted us asking if we would like a drink and then went on to name the specific coke products individually. I am assuming she had to memorize the menu and started with drinks. That is about all she had memorized as she had quite a difficult time taking our order. When our food was served to us by waitress it was to the right of our booth on a ledge that was closer to the kitchen instead of walking around to the front of our booth.  One in our party ordered Thai chicken pizza. Literally this was brought to our table a crust with vegetables (NO Peanut sauce and no or very little chicken visible).  We brought this to our waitress attention who in turned sent the alien manger over. He literally stared at the pizza for minutes before offering to send out peanut sauce. What I find appalling is this is a signature CPK dish and if you glanced at one that was made normally and what was served to us it would take a second to know a step or two was missed while preparing this dish yet the manager clearly did not recognize this fact. So clearly the  management and cook staff were aliens too!  This was eventually taken off our bill but needless to say our party of six had a sub par dining experience at CPK!

I&#39;ve been here a few times over the past few years. The food is usually decent and the service reasonably great. This time was a complete letdown. The best indication of how a place treats customers is to eat there on a Sunday night. Five weeks back, we did. Fernando, I think, (and I&#39;m not sure, but I&#39;m still venturing to use the name openly here because I was hopping mad by the end of our visit) was completely inconsiderate to us. He seated us, took our order (a pizza and a Kung Pao spaghetti which I&#39;ve never tried before), and then disappeared to chat with a colleague. Luckily, we flagged him down and told him we needed an appetizer, which came in record time along with the pizza. However, as we (quickly) wolfed down the pizza, it seemed as though he was more interested in his chitchat than bringing us our spaghetti. It was around 5 minutes before closing (and this wasn&#39;t our fault--we had ordered at least 30 minutes in advance), he came up to us (real slick) and asked us if we needed anything else. Confused, we reminded him about the spaghetti. This was the exact exchange:

F: Oh, I completely forgot about it. What was it, again? Kung Pao spaghetti? I&#39;ll tell them--they make it fast. (Glancing at kitchen--chefs were packing up).
Us: (Confused and looking at each other) ??!!??? 
F: It won&#39;t take long.
Us: (Exchanging exasperated glances) No, it&#39;s okay...(and before we could finish he pipes up)
F: Oh, you sure? I can bring you something else--complimentary dessert or something? (Not pausing for us to respond) No? Oh, next time you&#39;re here just find me and I&#39;ll get you something special, okay? 
(At this point, my husband and I were disgusted and completely put off and basically would have yelled and demanded an apology if not for the fact that it was 9 pm on Sunday night and we were exhausted. I&#39;m yet to speak to the manager, and maybe I&#39;ll update after that). 

Overall, disappointing, considering the food is pretty over-priced too. I think you&#39;d have better luck eating there on weekdays or Saturdays, all of which times have worked great for me in the past."

Had an issue with a server - the manager tended to immediately and apologized to surrounding customers. 
The chefs mixed up half of our appetizer - they comped it - replaced it within 5 minutes and the manager delivered it.

Sadly, I will pass next time on the Tortilla Spring rolls. Nothing special.

The Hawaiian BBQ pizza was de-LISH!

And Julianne, our server, was fabulous."

I didn&#39;t need to look at the menu.  I knew what I wanted.  The BLT pizza- I&#39;ve loved it for sixteen years.  Okay- here&#39;s where I get choked up...the pizza was tasteless, terrible--a poor imitation of the BLT pizza that I had loved.  My husband had a veggie pizza that was just okay.  Maybe it&#39;s a sign of the times.  Maybe restaurants are cutting costs by using cheaper ingredients.  I don&#39;t know, but I know I won&#39;t be back."

The food quality is consistently good, but the service seems to be slipping. When I&#39;m in Arlington Heights lately, I&#39;ve eaten here b/c I know it&#39;s a kid-friendly place with a kids menu. 

But today was disappointing.  The hostess asked if I needed a high chair,  which I did.  I stood there at my table for about 2 min. before I realized no one was bringing me one.  After trying to lock eyes with any passing busboys/waitstaff, I gave up and got one myself.

I had the $7.99 lunch special: salad and mini-pizza (BBQ chicken). It was tasty as always.  But no bread was offered or brought to us. My ice tea glass stood empty for 20 minutes until I had to ask the waitress for a refill (by then my ice had melted).  She brought the check without asking if I wanted anything else (my toddler was hungry still).  And though I appreciate how quickly they clear plates away, a manager-guy scooped up my pizza plate even though I was still feeding my toddler off of it - before I could say anything!

This CPK is always crowded around lunchtime, and often at dinner, so that could explain the hit-or-miss service.  But, the people there are unfailingly friendly - I do like that."

The service was really good; our server was very attentive.  I came here with friends for lunch on a weekend.  Normally my fav is the BBQ Chicken pizza, but it looked like they added a lot of new items to the menu since the last time I&#39;d been there (like fish tacos, pork tacos, sandwiches, chopped salads) The white corn guacamole as an appetizer was very good!  They do get busy at this location, but I think take out is an option.  All in all, I like coming here."

Its not just a cafe. It offers you wide range of yummy gelatos, smoothies, shakes and what not. Ofcourse they all taste yummy.

Apart from a great eat-out, you can get yourself a mug/tee/bottle/keychains printed with any art of yours. Each table has a set of sharpies and paper, draw what you want to be printed on any goodie. They have board games too!! You just cant get bored there. 

It is run by interns of GigiU. They are just adorable and will serve you with all their heart."

It is attached to GiGi&#39;s Playhouse (a Downs Syndrome Achievement Center) but I did not realize they had a coffee shop / gelato and cookie cafe shop. 

After walking in,first glance it is a nice space bright, colorful, inviting. I moved closer to the counter looking at the coffee selections and gelato, nice variety along with some cookies, milkshakes and smoothies. I decided on some cherry cheesecake gelato and a large coffee. There is places to sit in the facility in couch ,regular chairs high tops or even sit at the coffee bar. The facility was clean, everything was really good and deserve excellent ratings but this is not what set this place over the top!

The cafe is run with assistance of interns that all have downs syndrome! They work the front, serve and they help make the cookies...truly inspiring to witness. While sitting there enjoying my desert taking things in, there was another head turning moment. They had a little gift area to the side with hand made coffee mugs made by the interns and it looks like they offer options to have custom ones made or to even have parties (like a theme birthday party) where you can make things.

I will need to go back soon, besides the treats I would like to take in more about what is all going on at this fine little cafe!

Side note: The service rating is legit. The interns I had did take a little bit more time filling the order (with some help) but not too long. I was very delighted with the quality of the servers wanting to make sure that I was happy which that trumps speed in my book anyday!

This has become my favorite place for Mexican takeout. Everything is made to order, so if you&#39;re in a rush, you&#39;re probably better off calling your order in. 

The guacamole wasn&#39;t my favorite but it was still pretty good. Personally, I think it needs some salt. I always get the steak burrito and husbands goes for the tacos. Large portions, relatively inexpensive, and good selection. I wish they would open a location in St. Charles. 

 Don&#39;t forget the horchata!"

Three super salsas available: mild green, smokey spicy red salsa and a peppery HOT green. 
Granted the $8.50 price tag on the burrito is  bordering pricey, but the freshness and portion size make it worth it to me.

As someone who is Mexican and knows the food well I love going here when I&#39;m in the mood for my tacos con salsa. Every time I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve had a good experience. I recommend getting a torta or a loaded burrito, my favorite meat of choice is the carne asada. Lastly, their horchata is good, not amazing so I gave them a 4 out of 5 for the review. Horchata (rice water) is a must for Mexican food joints and I love having it with my meal. Make sure to try it, personally I prefer mine to be a tad bit sweeter.

My background:
I grew up with a great family who were Mexican from Texas, so I have had many great meals growing up of having fresh food. I have also dined at the best places in Acapulco and can appreciate a freshly prepared meal.

My experience here:
I walked in at 3pm and it was empty. Just one other customer before me. I sat at the counter and watched tv. I ordered a stuffed steak burrito that had it rolled in with rice, avocado, fresh onion, and cilantro. I also ordered 3 chicken  tacos with beans and rice. 

Order total came to $18.50. I ordered the larger burrito at $8.50, there is a smaller one for $4.25.

I am pleased the burrito had fresh ingredients great fresh lively cilantro, REAL AVOCADO and fresh rice. A Good amount of  steak.

 Emily&#39;s is across the street from the Jewel by Stearns ( strip mall next door where UPS store is). It was worth the tiny extra drive from Downtown Bartlett.
 
Will go again for freshly prepped food.  Its casual where you can eat there if you grab one of the 4 booths or a place at the counter. Otherwise, don&#39;t cook tonight and enjoy take out.

PS: I enjoyed the real re fried beans and rice

Mexican Restaurant Comparison:

Before this restaurant came along; Bartlett , Streamwood, and Roselle and yes, even Schaumburg have had pretty much dog food for Mexican Restaurants over the past 14 years that I have been around trying places.
I had settled for Chipotle for awhile until I learned about their GMO reporting. Most places over- salt meats or use Adobo seasonings containing MSG which can give you wicked headaches and is a toxic additive anyway. Some places use rice from a can. This restaurant had fresh prep food so its a good alternative."

I&#39;ve had tostadas with steak, chicken and al pastor. They&#39;re, more or less, open-faced tacos. Except instead of sandwich bread, you have a crispy corn tortilla as the base.

The veggies are good and all, but you&#39;re here for the meats. It doesn&#39;t matter what kind of meat you get, it&#39;s well seasoned. They also give you some free green salsa on the side (not habanero, surprisingly, just something a bit sour.)

Best of all, the tostadas are only $2 and change each, and two is enough to assuage even the most intense lunch craving. I even threw in some yellow rice on the side, which was nicely seasoned as well.

For less than $6 for lunch, it&#39;s hard to find a better place than Emily&#39;s."

The hubby and I wandered over to the shopping center across the street from Jewel and noticed a few people milling about inside. We walked in and quickly decided on our carryout order. 

So this restaurant has been open for about a month. It is family owned and operated (my favorite!). A couple of cousins and the mom/aunt are hustling to run this fresh operation. The grand opening complete with free tacos al pastor is scheduled for the first week of November. I don&#39;t know an exact date, but it&#39;s worth a visit to find out before then. 

Anyhow, there is seating for about 12 people although they are definitely doing mostly carryout. The whole look is bare bones right now, but it&#39;s clean, the kitchen is wide open and they are totally focused on the food. 

Let&#39;s talk about the food. Shall we?

We ordered a steak burrito without cilantro, chicken quesadillas (not on the menu for our son), a side of rice, a side of refried beans, a chicken taco, a steak taco and a ground beef taco (all tacos with onion and lettuce). Dinner for three for under $20!  Heck to the yeah!!  So the good and the not-so-good...the burrito arrived with cilantro. The hubby wasn&#39;t thrilled but still enjoyed the meal. Quality steak that was very filling.  The chicken quesadillas were perfect. Beautifully cooked chicken breast showed up in both the quesadilla and the taco. Order the steak or the chicken...or both!  The rice was nice. The beans arrived with melted cheese and that addition was a surprise. The tacos were delicious even though they arrived with cilantro and onions rather than lettuce and onions. The tortillas were pliable and clearly fresh. We watched the auntie/mom slice the fresh beef off a roast before she grilled it.  You can&#39;t get any better than that!  The ground beef taco was kinda boring, but the steak and the chicken made up for that. The wait time was a little lengthy and they knew it. They&#39;re still finding their groove, so they apologized, but we were totally okay with waiting for a fresh cooked dinner. Plus, the Bears game was being recorded on the DVR so we weren&#39;t missing anything!  

To recap, try the chicken or steak. Call ahead to cut down on your wait time. And support this local, non-chain business!  It&#39;s nice to have somewhere different to go that is five minutes from home. Let&#39;s keep it that way, Bartlett friends. :-)"

You&#39;re also getting something that tastes a lot better though.  I&#39;d say the prices are about in line with say, Chipotle, if it helps.

Don&#39;t be fooled though....this is not &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican food.  It is however, authentic American Mexican food, which is what most people really mean when they say that.  And its good.

The tacos are good but too greasy for my taste. Rice is slightly hard but the meats are grilled in front of you so they have a nice grilled taste to them. The steak burrito I had was great. The steak was how steak should be and had no fat or veins to the majority of it. Would definitely come back but I wish they had complimentary chips and salsa.

Called in a phone order for a steak taco dinner with cilantro, onion lettuce and cheese., chips and salsa, quac and chips and two chicken quesadillas. Was told the cheese was .25 extra, no prob. Told to come in 15 minutes.  I show up 15 minutes later and see the food sitting on the table all bagged up.  The male employee is just starting to fill some sauces in cups and looking around kind  of like a lost puppy opening cabinets, fridges etc.  A dine in customer get there food served to them by the young male. (as I stand and wait).  I repeated the order just to make sure he had it all. he agreed it was all in the bag.  WRONG  Get home, open food.  Guess what, tacos have no cheese or lettuce.  I called the store just to mention they forgot the cheese etc, he immediately tells me they did put cheese, then he says they didn&#39;t and to check my receipt he doesn&#39;t THINK he charged me.  Ok whatever obviously this kid will be working a register forever with his personality.  I hang up, take a bite of the taco...STEAK IS COLD.  Call back and asked why it is cold.  He tells me it cant be cold.  They made it today and the steak is always hot.  So not fresh.  I open the guac, out of the 4oz cup they give you about 2oz for $4.  The chips were store bought milagro brand as I watched them fill the bags. 

The guy on the phone tells me to microwave it and if I don&#39;t like it call the manager.  Ok is the manager there, no.  When will he be in?  I don&#39;t know, whats the managers name? Jesus.  
I asked him if they always have this type of attitude. he said I don&#39;t know.  Well they obviously don&#39;t know much.   

What I got today was horrible. Hopefully my $20 will help them pay the attorney fees, to break the lease within the next few months at 968 S Bartlett Rd since there is no way they are going to make it.  So anyone looking to buy some new restaurant equipment, maybe you should leave your number with &#34;The Manager&#34; because I don&#39;t see them needing it much longer.  

For Mexican restaurants being a dime a dozen, you would think you would provide better food and service.  Skip this place and head down to El Faro."

It was delicious - it was the $7 version without cheese and without sour cream and it needed nothing more added, not even the sauces placed in my bag. It was very fresh and tasted like very high quality ingredients. 
I&#39;m rating Emily&#39;s 5 stars for what it is to me - an excellent take out place in Bartlett for Mexican food. There are a couple of sit down tables but I am not comparing Emily&#39;s to the Mexican sit down restaurants in Bartlett.
It fills for me a Mexican lunch niche perfectly. I&#39;d been going to another place in Bartlett on 59 for take out for years but I recently got a very sharp 1-inch chicken bone in a burrito. I reported it but about a month or so later I got another. So, I tried Emily&#39;s and was blown away by the value - again, much more taste and freshness than what I had experienced elsewhere."

Fresh ingredients and by far the best steak I&#39;ve received at a place like this. Delicious and not crazy fatty/grisly like some places.

I had surgery on the Wednesday prior and have been learning how to move around on crutches for the past 3 days.  My mother and I were looking forward to a delicious dinner, but the village was hosting an art show and had closed the roads leading to the restaurant.  As such I had to slowly hobble down 2 blocks from where we parked.  It&#39;s amazing what you take for granted as normally this distance would have been a trifle, but crutches really slow you down.

After our wonderful dinner we were trying to strategize the easiest way for my mother to get the car and pick me up as she is visiting from out of town and is not familiar with the area.  The General Manager, Stash, saw us trying to find an easy way to the car and offered to show us a shortcut.  Not only did he lead us to a back way out, but he showed me a place to sit while he walked my mother to my car and then drove with her to where I was waiting.  Stash lastly helped me place my crutches in the car and would not accept the tip my mother was trying to give him.

I cannot thank Stash enough for everything he did for my mother and me.  He truly exceeded my already high expectations."

I only had a salad but tried two of the others dishes. Three people at the table ordered the Salmon. Which was very good. The other dish that I tried was the Lagnsa. This was very good and I could have probably ate that entire dish. However I decided to only order a casear salad, which you can pretty much order anywhere and it should taste the same. This wasn&#39;t the case, but it was awful. Average at best. With this said, I would come to eat here again with the expectation that I would order a delicious italian dish...

I&#39;ve been a regular over the years, and I can say with the utmost confidence that the food here is always fresh and filling - never a time to be disappointed. 

Two dishes I&#39;d like to highlight on my most recent trip here, the calamari fritti and quattro stagioni pizza. The calamari batter is so light and the portion is HUGE - definitely not complaining ;). The pizza on the other hand has everything you can ask for - prosciutto, artichoke, mushroom, olive, egg. There&#39;s an over easy egg right in the middle of the pizza and the waiter will come sprinkle that yolk just. right. over. everywhere. Love It.

You can definitely get a sense of family when you come here (I searched up for famiglia meant in Italian and indeed it means family). Whether it be the first warm plate of bread that they bring out with the killer olive oil to the friendly waitstaff, you just can&#39;t get enough off that in this busy world. Hope this place will always keep up the good work."

I usually come here every Friday &amp; it is always packed.  I would recommend reservations especially on a weekend night.  One of the main reasons my first experience here was not excellent is I didn&#39;t really see anything on the menu I was familiar with or cared a lot for.  My second visit here I asked for something that wasn&#39;t on the menu with was gnocchi with vodka sauce.  I can say with out hesitation that this place served me the absolute best gnocchi with vodka sauce that I have ever tasted.  

Another one of my favorites here is the clams.  They serve two different kinds of clams.  One of them is served in a red marinara sauce &amp; the second is served in a white creamier sauce.  

They do have a full bar here &amp; serve champagne by the bottle.  Their champagne prices by the bottle are reasonable.  We usually order a bottle of Vueve Clicquot for $90.  This is definitely cheaper than some champgane prices in the city.  

Lastly the service here has always been phenomenal.  Between the service the food &amp; the atmosphere I really enjoy eating here &amp; will continue to come here on a regular basis.  I also like the outside seating that they have available in the summer.  It makes coming here for lunch even better."

I left a $14 dollar tip and the waiter, Gino, entered a $50 dollar tip when my credit card was charged.  Typically I would think this might be an accidental error but our waiter had said and acted in ways throughout the night that gave me an untrusting feeling.

When I called the restaurant to ask about why I was overcharged on my credit card, they looked into it and found the &#34;error&#34;.  They asked I come all the way back to the restaurant to pick up the $36 dollar difference in cash because to put the amount back on my card would be &#34;too much paperwork&#34;.  It was a huge inconvenience and... I&#39;m still baffled about this, but I did not get a SINGLE apology from the restaurant.  

I&#39;ve been in the service industry and I understand accidents happen but this was a huge error to make that would not be tolerated in most places.  To top that off, their response was terrible.

My first visit was mediocre at best so I didn&#39;t leave a review, I thought I would give it another chance and I&#39;m sorry I did. The wait staff was horrible and the food was even worse. When you walk in the arrogance of the hostess and manager truly feels like they are doing you a favor visiting their restaurant. Kind of weird. Sorry guys this place is not that special...The pasta tasted like frozen store bought and the sauce was tasteless and not seasoned. As for the fish... OMG!

The waitress was just a bit off. She didn&#39;t seem to actually care how we were doing or want to check in. She asked if we wanted soup or salad and we both ordered one. We had no idea that the salad was going to be $7! If you want to ask if we want to add a soup or salad fine, but I felt like the practice was a bit predatory. That said, the minestrone was some of the best we&#39;ve ever had. The salad was pretty good and a decent portion. I just wish they had been more upfront and honest about it. 

Actually, this was one of the best Italian meals I&#39;ve had in a while. I find most Italian places are just pasta and sauce that I could make myself. Not here. The rigatoni was exceptional. The veggies were all well done and the sauce was well above average. My friend got the salmon and said it was fine. They asked how he wanted the fish done (i.e. medium, well done, etc). Is that even a thing? It was a bit odd but it was good. Overall, I give them 5 stars for the food but 1-2 stars for service."

Small thing, but open the wine at the table and leave it there.

Our server was very nice and thorough, but our lunches took a very long time. Shortly after we placed our order, a group of kids (around 9 or 10 years old who should have been in school, I thought) came in. They were loud (but not as loud as one might have expected) and held up the kitchen a while, I suspect. When we left, the host apologized to us about the noise and explained that the group was the final &#34;exam&#34; of an etiquette class. 

The food was good--I had a veggie panino with goat cheese and it was lovely. My friend ordered the three course prix fixe and said it was the best meal she&#39;d had in a long time (they had a special menu in honor of their anniversary). Something on her plate involved meat balls. I did not try it. I loved the crème brûlée, which made it all worthwhile for me. 

I&#39;ve been to Francesca&#39;s Fortunado in Frankfort and that experience didn&#39;t make me super excited to try Francesca&#39;s Famiglia, but I was glad I did. Except for the long wait on our food (and the unexpected group of children nearby), it was a tasty experience with good service."

I&#39;d been dying to try Francesca&#39;s for a while because of their gluten free menu, but picking up food from here was a total disappointment!  I got the gluten free Penne Aalio e Olio.  The description on the menu said it had fresh garlic, diced tomatoes, and spinach.  Sounds good, right?  The gluten free pasta actually had an okay taste, but it was terribly overcooked so the penne was just shreds of pasta.  I know gluten free pasta is delicate, but that&#39;s really not acceptable for pasta from a restaurant.  Also, there were hardly any tomatoes, and the spinach was really really soggy.  The garlic was in a giant clump at the bottom of the dish, so when I discovered it and tried to spread it out, the flavor was overwhelming.  I felt like a fire-breathing dragon.

Maybe I&#39;d come back and give them another chance, but at $14 a dish (with tax), I think there are a bunch of better options out there.  I should have listened to the other reviews!"

They had a wonderful Ravioli special I had REALLY been looking forward to. Sold out at 6:30. Really? The chef couldn&#39;t plan better?
I ordered my second choice and it was so bland, I couldn&#39;t believe it. I left hungry and ticked off. Should have stayed home and made Bertolli."

It&#39;s straight on Franchesca&#39;s branded food that I would describe as somewhat overpriced and inconsistent dish over dish over time - I eat here often and come up with the same refrain - who is in the kitchen ? 

While it&#39;s Italian - it&#39;s incredibly Hispanic on all fronts.  

I wish they would become a gourmet Hispanic restaurant - we have nothing like that here.

Identity issues but that being said they appear to do well - but again the food - restaurant choices are so slim that almost average could be considered great. 

Open up up new restaurants in Barringtin!

Please !"

I have been to several locations and this was by far the worse.  The service was horrible.

I came here with my boyfriend on a double date with my parents.  It was a Saturday night so I called and asked how long the wait was, the girl on the phone said 15 minutes.  I then asked if they do call ahead seating so I could put my name on the waiting list and head over.  She said yes and took my information.

When I arrived they claimed they do not do call ahead seating or reservations and the wait was now 25 minutes.  I was frustrated and they told me that they would get me seated as soon as possible.  Well our 15 minutes quickly turned into over an hour with someone telling us you will be next a couple times.

The service sucked.  Our waiter kept forgetting about us.  The table next too us was a bunch of obnoxiously drunk and loud 40 year olds.

It took about 40 minutes and we asked about the food.  once we asked it was brought out immediately... my pasta was burnt like it had sat under the fryer.

I would give them one star, but the manager tried to appease us by giving us a free dessert platter.  But, needless to say, I will not be returning anytime soon."

We called and asked how long the wait was for a party of 4 on Saturday, they said oh, about 15 minutes.  Seriously,  we even called a second time and again &#34;about 15 minutes&#34; so we put our name in and said we would be there in a few minutes because we were in the area..  So when we got there and the place was packed we walked up to the hostess and gave our name and she said we can&#39;t find it, so the other girl came and looked in the book and in the computer and couldn&#39;t find our name.  The manager came up and said oh we don&#39;t take names until people are actually here.  We told him about our conversation we JUST had with his staff and he said he would oblige our request and it would be a few minutes.  

We waited and waited and after a bit I went and asked the hostess how long it would be and she said &#34;well we said 15 minutes and it has been only 12 minutes.  !!!!!!!!!!!!
Needless to say we waited and one of the managers or assistant manager not sure who, kept coming buy and saying &#34;only a few more minutes, we&#39;re clearing a table now&#34;  &#34;only a few more minutes, tables are leaving now&#34;  &#34; we will be seating you shortly&#34;, etc. etc.  I kid you not, I would have rather cut our losses and been told the truth and made it another time.  

Finally seated 50 minutes later!   Well, the other couple at this point was so hungry they could have cared less what we ordered.  So we started with calamari, it was served nicely and fresh and pretty timely.  We finished our appetizer and were waiting with empty glasses (both water and wine) for our waiter to take out order.  We flagged him down twice.  We were given the &#34;one minute sign&#34;.  Finally, we ordered!!  Nothing exceptionally difficult.  A chicken dish, ravioli, a salad and some lamb chips.  IT TOOK OVER  40 MINUTES.  When the waiter came to the table and I asked if there was a problem he said &#34;the manager knows that you have been waiting&#34;  &#34;it&#39;s not my fault&#34;. Seriously??  When the food arrived you could tell it had been under the heat lamps for a long time because the ravioli was dry around the edges.

The manager arrived and said he was sorry and would love to buy us a Limoncello after dinner, we graciously accepted, acknowledging his attempt to make things right.  When our waiter returned to clear the table, we asked for the check, not knowing when or if he would return again.  Another manager came to the table and apologized and asked if we would please accept dessert for our troubles.  My appetite was pretty well shot by this time, but again we accepted.  10 minutes later, dessert, we were asked if we wanted coffee.  We ordered cappuccino and regular coffee.  While we waited, the Lemoncello arrived, from the other manager.  One hand didn&#39;t know what the other was doing.  But they tried.

Well the end to a perfectly horrible experience, the coffee was cold!!  I was here once before and gave it a good rating based on the food and service back in 2011-what changed?  Looking at some of the other reviews, it seems like a lot.

Thanks for trying, but too many wrongs did not make it right.  I won&#39;t be back."

Showed up at 6:30, the lady said they were not checking in the 6:45 crowd, so I should come back in 15 minutes to check in. Fine, squeezed between 30 people in the waiting area, stood at the crowded bar. Ordered a Sauvignon Blanc, got a Chardonnay. Politely told the bartender, he rudely got me another glass.  At 6:45 I go back to check in, the lasy says 15 minute wait for my table. At 7:05 I ask again, told to keep waiting. At 7:15 I hear them seating the 7pm people, so I politely remind them I have a 6:45 reservation. The lady has the nerve to tell me I am going to have to leave the bar, get in a line by the door, and wait behind 6 other couples with 7pm reservations. They had no clue what they were doing at this place, what a joke.  Finally sit after complaining, get a table with bread and cheese, no oil. That takes a while. Order a glass of wine and meals at same time, wine never shows up. Salads arrive, and then we wait....and wait...and wait...people seated after us get their appetizers, salads, entrees, drinks and checks before we finally mention I have no wine, and where are our entrees!  No apology, just a shrug and &#34;everyone is waiting.&#34;  Well, the food was mediocre, the service was aweful, and the experience was lousy. Never, ever again. What a sorry pitiful excuse for a restaurant. Amateurs. Go somewhere else and get better service, food and atmosphere for less money."

With all of the great restaurants to pick from in this price range why did I go to Francescas last night? Because the food and service WAS ALWAYS top notch. Last night our server was so distracted and unorganized she forgot to bring wine, messed up our orders, (that we waited forever to get--and were COLD), and while we waited for our entrees she came BACK to the table and asked, &#39;are you ready to order yet?&#34;---as if she&#39;d never been there. Her station wasn&#39;t even busy-she had our table and 2 others (all with 4 guests). Starters and salads were tasty-as always, but SUPER skimpy..are they suddenly cost cutting? We were celebrating and made the restaurant aware of it when we booked the reservation and when we arrived with a cake. Sure, the waitress perked up and acknowledged it AT tip time, just before she brought our cake. Never again. I spoke to the manager and gave him the feedback-he fiend a weak apology and invited us back to try again. Why? To be ignored? served cold food that was supposed to be hot? Goodbye Francescas!"

Another family was seated in the same area of the restaurant and after 5 minutes, they got up and carried their plates out to another section (we should of done the same) Restaurant was busy, but host should of recognized any small party would of been better seated in another area. And because of the large groups, we waited on for everything...we had to ask several times for bread and water. When dinner arrived food was hot and flavorful, but the loudness of the table behind us was VERY hard to ignore. Normally we linger with desert, coffee and after dinner drink....not on Saturday night! In hindsight if the host does not pay attention to the area where you are being seated, you should speak up."

Crowded - can hardly walk between tables - they must be over the fire code limit - no way you can pack that many people in there.

Was there on a Sat night for a bday dinner with a group of 10 and there were several other groups - I felt sorry for any couple trying to have a nice dinner/conversation.

Just way to jam packed to enjoy yourself.

Food was ok, nothing to write home about.  Portions are grossly huge.

Bread was hard as a rock but 1,000 degrees inside

Service was fair at best. Menu tries to be too trendy. No decent choices for kids either.  Hard to read the sloppy hand written menu too.

Could be really good with a few minor improvements, but I won&#39;t be back.

The only Italian places I remember are all the Olive Gardens and some hole in the wall place in Wheeling (on Hintz Road, disgusting).

Right from the get-go, this place was awesome. The servers were all extremely friendly. We ordered a two glasses of reisling, salad and a shrimp bisque for starters. The salad was nice but the bisque was out of this world!! Of course, we were given the usual bread and butter and olive oil before this. It was fresh and warm. :)

Then for main course we had some chicken tortellini dish and i think a &#34;pollo alla salvio&#34; or something. Both of these dishes were unbelievably tasty. It just left you with a very satisfied feeling. I kept wanting to stuff my face but resisted and got it packed for lunch the next day. Also, I had to save some space in the tummy for dessert. 

To bring the meal to a close, we ordered a creme brulee and a coconut cake with caramel sauce and creme anglais. I cannot even begin to describe how delicious the cake was. It was quite a big piece too and was garnished with a few mint leaves. I always eat these if provided - nature&#39;s mouth freshener. The creme brulee was just as good as any.

I definitely would go back here. It was worth every penny and I really want to try all the different entrees. So glad to have discovered another gem in the suburbs."

They were also able to offer menu options with flexibility which was great since my mother is allergic to pepper, seafood, peppers, nuts, and a few more.  The waiter was able to put a dish together that met the needs of my mother and was delicious.

But this past Friday night we decided to get take out...I ordered a dish off of their gluten free menu, I believe it was the al pomodoro (sp?). It was supposed to have a &#39;spicy tomato basil sauce&#39;. Upon tasting it, I realized something was very, very wrong with this dish. 1) It had no spice whatsoever. Ok, no big deal, I can add spice. But as I took another bite it became clear that the chef had dumped about a pound of salt in the sauce. Now I love salt. I usually add salt to my dishes (bad, I know) but this dish was inedible. I was upset because the GF pasta itself was wonderful. It had great texture and was cooked perfectly. I wish I could&#39;ve eaten it but there was no way anyone could eat this. 

I called the next day to speak to the manager. He was not in and I was told I would get a call back at 3 pm that same day. I never did.

I called back that Monday.  I was cranky upon calling because no one had called me back when they said they would. &#34;Stash&#34; answered, the general manager. He listened to my explanation and he was extremely kind and understanding. He thanked me for bringing it to his attention and told me to stop in and he&#39;ll cook me a new one. I went in that evening after work to pick up the new dish. Stash offered me a glass of wine while I waited. He was really so, so sweet and generous. As I waited, I noticed every one of his customers that walked thru the door gave him a huge smile and handshake (and a hug!)  He brought me out the new dish, this time a different one, a veggie GF pasta with a garlic herb broth. It was fabulous!! 

Stash certainly made me want to come back despite the poor dish I was given. He makes his customers feel right at home."

The noise level and children running in the restaurant are a problem. The child next to us bumped into our table and I quickly grabbed my wine so it would not tip over. The children at another table ran around our table bumping into the chair.  One child threw pieces of bread on the floor. The parents did not pick up but left for the servers to do.

The food is a little overpriced, however, the discounted gift cards keeps it within the market price.  The Calamari Fritti and Mussels Pomodoro have great flavor.  I found that their Chicken entrees tend to be overcooked.  The pizzas and salads are ok but nothing special.

Delicious!! A plentiful steaming dish of pasta carbonara comes out. The bread was hot and soaked up the olive oil perfectly. The decor is very &#34;Italian&#34;, but not as nauseating as most Italian chain restaurants.

My husbands pork chop was as dry as shoe leather, not edible and my roast chicken came out floating in heavy cream sauce.  I guess for some who like cream sauces, this would be a treat.  I&#39;m not a fan and as the menu said nothing about the cream sauce, it was a dissappointment to us.  I say us, as after determining the pork chop is not edible I thought we could at least split the roast chicken.   Service is spotty.  People ask how everything is, but are in such a hurry to walk by the table, you can never say what the problem(s) are.

We were hoping this would become our new fave in the area, but no such luck.  The search for a good Italian restaurant in the Barrington area is still on.

Great (not inexpensive) dissappointment and we will not be back."

First and foremost the place was packed,  which some may find appealing.   Maybe it means they have good food?   Too bad there were SO many people waiting to check in, the lobby was literally packed.   Barely room to breathe.   We finally checked in for our 6:45 reservation at 7pm (yes we were on time and yes it took that long just to get to the hostess stand).  Were seated at a decent table and promptly ordered drinks.  My husband didn&#39;t like his and sent it back for something else.   Mine didn&#39;t come as ordered.   So both drinks had to be sent back.   We ordered the calamari,  which we found to be incredibly over cooked and didn&#39;t even finish.   The house bread and seasoned olive oil was delicious though.   We had been seated for about 30 minutes (maybe longer).  Finally had to ask or waiter if we could order our entrees.   He seemed surprised.  Food took a while but both our dishes were bone-in so would take longer than usual, they get a pass on this one.  The atmosphere could have been more romantic.   The place was very loud but family friendly.   We saw plenty of kids there.  Prices were about $15-$20 for a pasta dish and $25+ for a entrée.   All in all a great more fresh version of the chain Italian restaurants.   Would be interested in dining there on a night other than Valentine&#39;s Day."

We have been here many times. The only problem sometimes is the service, we have had some waiters that are not too good. One time we actually handed our tip to one of the bus boys because he provided a much superior service.

The calamari is the BEST, you must get it. We have loved all of their pasta dishes and have had everything from the tomato based, cream and olive oil type sauces. They always add enough seafood in their seafood dishes. The chocolate cake dessert is great too if you are looking for an extra treat.

This place is good for kids too - I love seeing families bringing their kids and teaching them good manners. Love it!"

I&#39;ll call him Guisseppe to protect his innocence, because I still think he&#39;s in the witness protection program... He&#39;s an Italian from NY, living in Chicago... hmmm?

Anyway, we were celebrating his wife&#39;s b-day and had a very nice dinner, server had a great sense of humor and was able to play with us through the night. 2 1/2 hrs later, a bottle of prosecco, bread, salad, boat loads of pasta and some yummy desserts, I was entering food coma land. 

One neat thing too is the photography in the place. Lots of portraits (street style), food shots and in general just a very nice atmosphere with friendly folks. 

Definitely won&#39;t be hard to get them back there again. And on Sundays apparently kids eat free, so bring &#39;em if you got &#39;em!"

It&#39;s supposed to offer authentic Italian food, but it doesn&#39;t. The Caprese had dry, tasteless Wisconsin blue cheese on it, instead of mozzarella. The carpaccio was sliced so thin that it needed surgery to get it off the plate. There was something advertized as &#34;branzino&#34; - a prized fish from the Mediterranean. It turned out to be a soggy, and sorry Chilean Sea Bass. The manager blithely explained he uses Google to write the &#34;Italian&#34; in his menu! When asked for a recommendation on wine, the waiter went straight for the most expensive which further discussion revealed he knew nothing about.
A real disappointment!"

We had a early dinner around 5 when we got there the place empty.    Luckily I split a dish with one of my friends and when it was all said and done we both had food left over on our plates.  Not one person in our group finished their plate.  And it was not because we did not try.  The food was amazing.  Everything was cooked perfectly you could taste the freshness of the ingredients.  I got a pasta dish with scallops and shrimp with a light creamy pesto sauce.  Just AWESOME!  If I ever make it back to that neck of the woods I WILL be eating there.

My nephew &amp; I had medallions of veal which we both enjoyed. They were quite flavorful and complimented by the sides.  My brother &amp; S-i-L ordered from the days specials.  

My bro, had lamb shanks with mashed potatoes and vegetable.  It was not very &#34;Italian&#34;, but the taste of it that I had, made me wish I had ordered the same. So, what&#39;s &#34;Italian&#34; anyway?  I guess there were some hints of a tomato based gravy.

My s-i-l had  Grouper, a fish that I like very much.  She didn&#39;t eat all of hers and asked if I wanted to finish the  remaining portion of it, which I did.  When I tasted the grouper when it was first served, it seemed very good, but after it was served, half-way through the meal, it had taken on a rather &#34;fishy&#34; taste.  I mean like it lacked freshness.  Grouper is not a fish that retains freshness well.  In fact, I normally only eat it when I visit an area near to where it is caught .

The herbed olive oil for bread dipping is fantastic.

My bro tells me that they go here for dinner quite often when they want to just &#34;go out to eat&#34;.

One of the other pluses of this location is that it is connected to  free village indoor parking ."

We have been to the city locations many times and had great service and great food. I work in the area and all my co workers frequent this Francesca&#39;s. So on my way back from the city I stopped in for lunch. We were seated right away, but We waited awhile before we were greeted. We figured maybe the server had been double sat or something. While we are sitting there waiting we see the manager go around to all the tables dining except ours!? Thanks guy. It looked like maybe only one server was on and another woman was helping her out but she wasnt actually serving tables so im not sure what was actually happening. All i know is we almost walked out in between our app and entree because it took almost 30min. Our total time being there for a burger and a meatball sub was an hour and a half. Thanks but no thanks. There are plenty of great restaurants in the area that give much better service."

The location is nice, as it&#39;s tucked away on a small side street in Barrington.  Plenty of on street parking, and there&#39;s a parking garage right next door. 

Immediately after coming in the door, a gentleman took our coats and gave us a coat check ticket right at the door.  The Maître d&#39; seated us immediately.  The dining room is somewhat busy, and tables are fairly close together.  My wife and I both felt comfortable wearing jeans, and there were plenty of people who had brought their children there (though I still felt like I was surrounded by adults, and not at Chuck-e Cheese&#39;s).

Drinks, appetizers and entrées all came quickly and each was brought out after the other one was completed (they didn&#39;t bring the salad until our appetizer was finished).  Pasta portions were very large.  What we would call 4 servings at home was a single serving here.  However, looking around, there were others with non-pasta meals where the portions looked more reasonably sized. 

I&#39;d classify the food as &#34;pretty darn good Italian food&#34;.  Not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but absolutely delicious and worth coming back for."

We waited for 30 minutes past our reservation time before we sat down.  We waited in the crowded bar.  I tried to order drinks for the four of us, but the bartender said he had to help another guest first.  He then spent 20 minutes just with them, talking about different wines to try.  So, without a drink, we were eventually seated, and we then tried to order drinks.  After 30 minutes of waiting (no kidding), our waitress informed us that the bartender was backed up and she didn&#39;t have our drinks yet.  The manager tried to make things right by treating us to a round of drinks.  So, when my second glass of red wine came, it was in a port glass!  Our waitress informed us that the bar had run out of red wine glasses.  The bartenders are definitely hurting the profitability and the reputation of this restaurant.  There are plenty of other places to eat where they value my business.  Plus, this place is incredibly loud."

The owner came from Pop&#39;s in Schaumburg and that place got bad after he left.  The space is nice with huge ceilings.

I LOVE the food here!  I always get the steak tacos and my family always gets the pizza.  This time my wife got the ribs and they were literally fall off the bone.  Trina was our waitress and she busted here butt on a packed night!  They also offered $10 Coors Light buckets (5 total) and I think $13 buckets for others...which is a great deal if you have a large group of people or really thirsty.  This is now my favorite bar to go to and definitely my favorite Official Blackhawks bar!

UPDATE: I just went here again for a Cubs game...atmosphere was crazy!  New owner has changed up the menu a bit and really remodeled the bar very nicely...totally new place with a ton of brand new TVs and big screens!

A few minutes later when we still hadn&#39;t gotten menus, I walked to the bar and asked for a club soda. Again the bartender appeared unhappy with my order being so small. It was $2 which was ridiculous.  As she handed it to me she said irritably, &#34;I don&#39;t have a waitress today so you&#39;re going to have to be patient with me.&#34;  I walked away.  

When the team started coming in I told my sister we weren&#39;t welcome and that we should go, but someone else had planned the party so we didn&#39;t want to cause a lot of trouble. Then my sister went to the bar to ask for pitchers of water for the thirsty team. The bartender said &#34;sorry, our water machine is broken.&#34;

WTF?

At that point we were all eager to leave so called another local pizza place and they were happy to accommodate us.  Before we left I walked up to the bartender and took her picture. Once I did this she gave me the only smile I&#39;d seen from her all day. &#34;How can I help you, sweetie?&#34; was suddenly her attitude. I told her we were leaving and why. She feigned great confusion. We are presently having great fun at another local pizza joint that was happy to welcome these thirty kids and parents. We intend to tip well.

****Update:  The owner sent me a kind and apologetic message, and the coach of my nephew&#39;s team said that they usually have a great time at JL&#39;s.  I guess my experience was not typical - still a terrible first experience but I think it was just that one bartender.  I&#39;m upgrading my review from one star to three.  Thank you, Dave. 

P.S.  I do think it&#39;s going to become a family joke: &#34;Want to go out to eat?&#34;  &#34;Yeah, but let&#39;s go somewhere where they have WATER.&#34;"

I was kind of scared because I read some Yelp reviews and it was a mix reaction on the pizza, which I thought was great!! The nachos were awesome too, would totally order again!! The only complaint I have is that I ordered a vodka and tonic and after the first sip I knew it was vodka and water. Instead of making a fuss I asked the waitress for a half a cup of tonic water to mix in my drink. (All I wanted was a splash). She ended up charging us $3.00 for that little &#34;splash&#34;. I would come back, but stick with water in the future."

Very quick delivery and the hot food was still hot! My wife, who is 100% Italian, had the Calamari Pasta dinner and sadly was not impressed with it. She said the breaded calamari was mushy and thought it odd that it was served on top of the pasta and marinara sauce. I however, enjoyed my order, although it was only an Italian Sub. But it was loaded with meats, cheese and other toppings and was delicious. Fresh cut fries complimented the sub well. Will try other entree&#39;s with the hope of giving JL&#39;s more stars!"

The only change to the inside is a red wall with a Blackhawks logo.  Bathrooms still a complete disaster and nothing has really been cleaned up or changed other than the menu.  The items looked fairly good and the promoted they were made fresh but our food experience was poor.
They heavily promote pizza and even have it in their name.  This place was DEAD SLOW and it still took us nearly 35 minutes to get our pizza.  When it came it was under cooked in my opinion and had far too much cheese, which seemed to be a lower quality mozzerella that was not melted completely.
Both me and my friend had stomach problems for hours and hours after eating it.  
May give them one more chance in a few weeks to see if the new ownership makes any improvement but highly skeptical right now."

Started the night off with some cheese curds, the cheese tasty, the dough light and airy, with honey mustard to dip it in. Recommended.

The burgers.. Where do I begin? You HAVE to order a burger. It&#39;s necessary. I had a burger with Munster, bacon, mushrooms, and all of the toppings.. The burger was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of fat in the meat. Don&#39;t forget the Mac and cheese, heavenly. Worth it, has a lot of cheesy punch. The coleslaw slightly peppery. And the house made chips, excellent.

The boy had buttered burger with american and the toppings it comes with. The steak fries were tasty.

Only downfall, our server was delightful, but it took a bit of time to get the check and to also have it picked up to run the card. Also, during hawks games, the area we sat in, down the stairs, the volume needed to be up a bit more so we can hear the TVs! But we&#39;re definitely coming back in the future, many many times.

Their burgers are bland.
Almost positive they put zero seasoning on their patties before they hit the flattop, further evidenced by their appearance on Chicago&#39;s Best.  There is also no sear, which is how you get great flavor.

The service is always fine, and the people are nice, but you can tell the owners&#39; experience isn&#39;t in restaurants.  As someone who&#39;s worked in restaurants for over a decade, you know to season your proteins.

So as a suggestion, put some salt (kosher/sea) and pepper on your patties right before you cook &#39;em!  Also, cook em on a higher heat for a better sear.  Basic restaurant fundamentals.  These things seriously lack flavor.

On a positive note, the burgers are moist, and could be pretty decent.  And I hope these guys do well keeping a Palatine staple alive, but SEASONING!"

However, with the change in ownership last year, Yelp must have created a new profile.

We ate at Brandt&#39;s last over a month ago and the experience was great. I posted an updated review complimenting the staff about how much better the place was under new management. But, I hope our experience this night was just a bad night.

We were seated right away. Brandt&#39;s is small, and we were put at a table that was crowded in by other tables leaving little room for movement. The waitress was energetic, but was not attentive. We placed our order shortly after sitting down. It took her about ten minutes to deliver my drink, a coke. We were all talking and didn&#39;t realize it until we checked, but 1/2 hour passed before they finally delivered our food. 

Two items (three people in our party) had to send food back. My hamburger was supposed to be cook medium - their burgers are at least 1/2 pound and usually great. But one side of mine was charred and the other side was raw. Well, I guess if you take the average of them it was medium? I didn&#39;t mention that the fries were under-cooked.

They were apologetic and said they would replace the burger, which they did. The second burger was fine, and the fries were still under-cooked but better than before.

One hot button of mine is the server&#39;s attentiveness to drink refills. I drank my coke while waiting for the meal to be served. When they dropped off my second burger, they ran off quickly and did not notice all three of us had empty glasses. I was finally able to flag her down and ask for refills, but they really should watch for that.

I&#39;m disappointed about this visit. While I don&#39;t consider myself a regular, we&#39;ve been there over a dozen times over the years, and three times since they changed owners last year. So, again, I&#39;m hopeful this was just a bad day for them. But, it was memorable for us in an unsatisfying way. I really hope they get their act back together or they will lose some of their hard earned customers."

The food for me in general lacked a good texture and could&#39;ve had more refined flavor combinations. Most notably, the burger really lacked flavor in the meat (could&#39;ve used some more seasoning or wood/charcoal grilling) and could&#39;ve used a well toasted bun. The steak fries and sweet potato fries were simply soggy with no crispyness at all. The homemade chips and baked beans tried to do too much in terms of flavor and as a result, didn&#39;t really present a clear theme. The BBQ ribs were too dry and lacked flavor.

Given the other good reviews, maybe I came when they were too busy and would get a better experience if I came at a slower time."

It&#39;s a small space with the fine stench of mold. That coupled with country music that was too loud and three flat-screen TV&#39;s was almost too much to take.

It took awhile to get a waitress and when she came, she wasn&#39;t the most pleasant woman.

Uncharacteristic of Brandt&#39;s (though we&#39;d only been there two or three times previously), it took the better part of an hour to get our food (there were three of us).

When I came in, I immediately noticed how there wasn&#39;t very much room at all. The tables are squished together (we ended up sitting at one right by the bathroom), you have to squeeze through people at the bar to get to your table or the bathroom, and the tables themselves are pretty small. Cozy would be putting it nice. I like to have a little more room to move.

The menu is pretty limited - one burger that you can customize with your choice of potato, some other sandwiches, soups, and salad. I got the burger, which was very tasty and juicy. I really don&#39;t have any complaints about the food or the prices. It&#39;s good for what you pay. They also have a decent selection of beers on draft and bottled.

The service was meh. When I first walked in I wasn&#39;t greeted. I had to ask if you seat yourself or if someone is supposed to seat you. When I was seated, I had a choice between 2 tables, neither of which had much room. Our waitress was a little snippy at first, but got better later on. 

I would come back, but it wouldn&#39;t be my first choice. I definitely wouldn&#39;t come here with a big group of people."

Once inside that vibe turns into an over crowded but friendly neighborhood bar feel. 

We were a party of six and were seated at a table in the corner and were so wedged in that it was impossible for most of us to get up if we had to without the rest of the table also getting up. It really is a tiny restaurant with a few too many tables. 

I&#39;ve been to Brandt&#39;s several times and I usually stick with their specialty, the Brandt burger, and this time was no exception.  I like my burgers pink and juicy, and this one was cooked pretty close to well done even though I had ordered it medium. No worries though, it was good. The burgers are pretty giant and I happily took half home for lunch the next day. 

The bar area is small and only has two small TVs, so if you&#39;re looking for a place to watch a game this may not be the best bet. 

Overall - good food, really good service but a little bit small and crowded."

Every time I go in there before I even sit down the bartender says &#34;the usual?&#34; And Even though they ask me how I&#39;d like my burger cooked each time I order it, I&#39;m sure they already know. When ordering, they are so particular about how you&#39;d like your burger even going as far as asking if you would or would not like lettuce, tomato, grilled or raw onion. They&#39;d rather take the time to ask customers instead of you waste your time picking off what you don&#39;t want. All of this has been the Brandt&#39;s tradition since it has been there.

Arrived at 7:15 got a table at 7:50. No problem there, there is usually a bit of a wait. Ordered right away. 8:45 and no food in sight. I did however notice that carry-out orders were &#34;flying&#34; out of the kitchen in record speed. At this point 6 tables were occupied but none had received their meal. When I noticed a party of 7 seated across from us, 45 minutes earlier, still had not received their food I knew something was amiss. One member in our party ordered pretzels which took 30 minutes to arrive. At 8:50 we asked for our check as we had no desire to wait any longer for our food. Just as we were about to leave our waitress told us our food would arrive at any minute. Too late. We told Jodie- the manager on duty of our dissatisfaction and she was very apologetic and professional but had no explanation for the delay. We have been patrons of Brandt&#39;s for 35 years and have never experienced this.

Upon entering, I noticed that there was very little change from the last time I was here, which is good because I loved the character of the little cafe.  The downstairs area looks like it was the most renovated, now there&#39;s a TV &amp; a few high top tables with stools compared to what appeared to be maybe a total of 2 tables before.  

They used to have a small illuminated board with a few menu items, now they have a regular menu which has a lot more choices than before which was a much needed change.  Their burgers haven&#39;t changed which is phenomenal, but now they give you some choices to go along with your burger.  Each one comes with 2 sides, you can choose from fries, chips, sweet potato fries, cole slaw. mac &amp; cheese, veggies &amp; maybe 1 or 2 other things.  You can also pick which kind of bun you want, I opted for the pretzel but found that it was tougher to bite through than your typical buttered bun.  The fact that they added a whole appetizer section to their menu makes me want to stop in, have a few drinks at the bar/downstairs &amp; order some appetizers instead of a full blown meal like I&#39;ve been accustomed to.  Make sure to check out the historical significance of the building when you&#39;re reading the menu, it&#39;s a trip to picture this place back in the prohibition days!"

I just ordered the hamburger which is what they are famous for and it took 40 minutes to get the food.  It&#39;s a burger not a 7 course meal.

Also had the fresh chips with ranch dressing...prefect with my burger.  The new owner, Walt came over to see if everything was OK which was cool.

I ordered the pierogi plate. My aunt had the keilbasa plate. 

The only thing I did NOT like about this place was it was completely empty and the owner (at least I think she was the owner) rushed me with my pierogi options and stuck multiples of ones I had only ordered one of. I was like B!$@h relax. You don&#39;t have anything to do relax and pick my damn pierogi!!!!!

The pierogi are all steamed which is fine, but I prefer them to have a lil crisp burnt edge. That&#39;s how I make them at home with sautéed onions and it&#39;s so good!!! These were good tho and already made which is a plus. I haven&#39;t been back to this place tho and to be honest idk if I will for the simple fact of I don&#39;t like being rushed.

If you&#39;re in the mood for Polish food definitely stop in here. The food is authentic and good."

So when my friend suggested we check this place out I wasnt really thrilled. I tried polish food here for the first time and loved the pierogis. 

I ordered cheese, mushroom, potato and cheese, spinach and cheese and had it topped with the butter and onion sauce and really liked it. 

I even tried a fruit pierogi and thought it was just ok. I also ordered a soup it had dumplings in it too and found the serving size to be pretty generous.

Ive returned and watched my coworkers order sausage and cabbage, and like it but im not that adventurous and probably wouldnt like it. 

Overall this little spot is great and made me love pierogis. The ladies working here are pretty friendly too and help you order if you dont know what you are doing like me."

I grew up with polish food and you cannot beat the pierogies! I have been to several Polish restaurants in the Chicagoland area and this is my favorite. This is sort of a fast food kind of joint. Located in the light industrial neighborhood of Elk Grove, Illinois....they probably make most of their revenue during lunch with many blue collared workers coming in. Most are Polish immigrants with a mix of others. The restaurant is super clean and very nice despite the location. Both of my parents are from Poland and the food is simply amazing and tastes like my moms cooking!

Price wise was just right. U can come in and ask which pierogies u want. U will have a selection of meat, cheese, potatoes, etc. it would cost 7.99 for 9 from what I remember. They have other Polish foods available such as Borsch, kielbasa (sausage), and blintzes. 

They do speak Polish so they is a plus for newly arrived immigrants. Sorry...no alcohol here and I can see why. This is a lunchtime place that I noticed. Hard working blue collared people frequent this place for lunch. I don&#39;t think they open during Sundays."

The meat in the goulash was very tender. 
Service was also great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Unlike some places, they bothered to speak English to me and explain the dishes.

Answer: never. 

It was a Friday afternoon. We&#39;re out of turkey for sandwiches and the hubby says we&#39;ll just go out for lunch today since we&#39;re out of turkey. Ok, no problem. 

Friday morning at the office, I decide to ask my &#39;work mom&#39; if she would like to be my lunch date today and she accepts.

I&#39;m pretty much over all the same average food in the Elk Grove area and being restricted to a half hour lunch, you can&#39;t travel too far to dine out so I jumped on Yelp to see if there are any new places in the area and up pops EJ Pierogi! 

After reading a few reviews, we decided to make this our lunchtime destination. Our coworker (who is Polish, btw) kinda invites himself to join us for lunch after my work mom offered to bring him back something and let me tell you, I&#39;m so glad he did. He totally turned out to be our Polish ambassador! I found myself asking him what was what and would I like this or that?

At first, I wasn&#39;t sure if the lady behind the counter didn&#39;t like me but it turned out she was very kind and informative. By the end of our visit, she was growing on me and seemed very appreciative of me taking photos to post online to advertise their adorable establishment. 

Now this place is not located in the nicest building, but they really transformed what used to be a subway into a cute neighborhood place. They are located in the same building as the quick oil change place and next to a rundown hotel, but when you&#39;re inside this restaurant, you kinda feel like you&#39;re at someone&#39;s home (someone with a hot bar, that is).  The décor is minimal but the place is clean and tidy. The dining area is open and if they were packed full of people, it would not feel too crowded by any means.

They have all kinds of pierogis. Fruit, meat, potato and cheddar, cheese, mushroom, you name it! 

Did you know how filling pierogis can be? Neither did I! 

The two and a half of the NINE pierogis I ordered were fabulous. For pierogis, that is. I don&#39;t know much about them but they were tast-teeeeeee!!!

I did make time to ask &#34;what is the meat in the &#39;meat&#39; pierogis?&#34; and she informed me that it&#39;s a mixture of pork and beef. Thank goodness. I was a little scared there for a minute.

We were there a while waiting for them to fix up some blintz and soup, so we did figure out that if we ever want to dine here again, we would have to call in our order ahead of time. While we waited, we ask a lot of questions about different items on the menu and while I was walking around snapping pictures like a tourist in Italy (or Poland. maybe), I saw they make goulash!!! Now, I&#39;ll tell you a little something about me. As picky as I am about my food, and as much of a scaredy cat I can be when it comes to trying new things, I grew up with a European step-father. He used to make goulash and cabbage rolls and all sorts of things you wouldn&#39;t imagine I would ever try, but I did try these things growing up and really found I like a lot of these different foods. Keep the cabbage away, but I&#39;ll eat the stuffing inside in a cabbage roll or give me goulash any day of the week! I&#39;ll eat that stuff up! So I decided the next time we go, I will order the goulash if they have it available. 

We saw a sign for &#34;finger dumplings&#34; and asked what they are...we were informed they are little potatoes...but they take 7 minutes to make so we&#39;ll have to get those next time. 

Both of my coworkers ordered the Borscht soup. He liked it a bit more than she did. It didn&#39;t look too appetizing to me. They did have a chicken and dumpling soup on the menu that I debated ordering but glad I didn&#39;t because that would have just been too much food! He had the Kielbasa sausage and cabbage with potatoes and inhaled it! Both my work mom and I stuck with the pierogis and blintz as our main dish. I like the pierogis. It&#39;s not something I would eat regularly, but I did enjoy my lunch. I was a little surprised at how filing the pierogis can be!! I think it&#39;s the dough. It&#39;s pretty heavy. Like I said, I ate 2-1/2 of my pierogis and sent the rest home with my coworker because I wasn&#39;t going home after work nor did I think they would keep for another day or two. 

EJ Pierogi has a coupon deal on www.restaurant.com available for $2.00 with a $5 value with a minimum purchase of $7.50 so you can save a few dollars here. 

I&#39;ll definitely be back. Next time, I&#39;m sharing an order of pierogis with someone else or trying the goulash and definitely getting an order of those finger dumplings!!! I&#39;m so happy that I tried something new. I was not disappointed!"

We took advantage of the 50% off coupon and went to town on that menu!

We ordered:
- Red Borscht - classic and tasty with those mini dumplings
- Kraut &amp; mushroom pierogies - new flavor to me and fantastic
- Potato &amp; cheddar - my new favorite. Serious comfort food in a dumpling!
- Meat - meh, the meat was on the dry side and didn&#39;t really pack an flavor making for a sandy texture.
- Spinach &amp; cheese - excellent savory choice with plenty of spinach.
- Pyzy Meat - pretty much the star of the show. It&#39;s like a round, meat stuffed dough ball of fluffy, chewy deliciousness. Little pockets of heavenly comfort food is what they were. These must be eaten fresh because they get hard after a night in the fridge and don&#39;t soften up with heat.

Prices are decent even without the coupon but the coupon makes it easy to try a little bit of everything to quickly become familiar with their menu. Good home cooking for a decent price means I&#39;ll be back again and again!"

The place is immaculate. Clean and a modern interior. I&#39;d have no problem staying here to eat. Nevertheless, I was getting a big order for the family and had to get home.

We ordered:
12 Potato Pierogis
3 Spinach Pierogis
3 Meat Pierogis
3 Kraut &amp; Mushroom Pierogis
3 Cheese and Potato Pierogis
2 Polish &#34;Hamburger&#34; Patties
Dumplings
Polish Sausage
3 Cheese Blintzes

The Pierogis are great. A good size but not too doughy. I particularly liked the Spinach Pierogis.

The Polish &#34;Hamburger&#34; patties were good. My wife did not like hers as much as I liked mine. The ones we normally get at another place are saltier, which apparently my wife prefers. I actually liked EJ Pierogis patty more because it was not as salty.

My wife and kids loved the dumplings. They were all gone without minutes. I&#39;m not a big fan of dumplings so I have to take their word. The dumplings were larger than your typical Silesian dumplings.

The polish sausage was huge. Flavorful and well cooked. They even added cooked onions. The sausage by itself, on a roll or bread, could have easily been somebody&#39;s lunch.

Finally...the blintzes. OUTSTANDING. Sweet cheese on the inside and a soft dough on the outside. They sprinkle butter and sugar on them too. Blintzes are a tricky thing---sometimes there&#39;s too much dough and too little filling and vice versa. This place has it down to a science. I have to say they were the best cheese blintzes I&#39;ve ever had.

For all this food we paid $39. We had a $5 restaurant.com gift certificate so it was $34. Really not that bad of a price considering all the food. It fed a family of four and we had leftovers. 

I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant. They even serve goulash, soup, and some kind of mushroom and melted mozzarella sandwich that looked amazing. The server behind the counter was very nice and very helpful when explaining the menu to you. It&#39;s now my must-stop for Polish fast-food in the Elk Grove Village area."

The quality of food is ok. The quantity is great for the price.
Good parking, I think they might have the outside sitting, not available on my visit.
Good parking. The pictures i saw in some other reviews, don&#39;t do this place justice: there is room for improvement, but it is def not as ghetto as it looks from the outside.
And yes, zapiekanka (Polish pizza bread). At quarter of the price that any other place has it for! And still very good!

I liked the meat, potato &amp; cheese, kraut &amp; shroom, and sweet cheese piergos the best but they were ALL good. You can have grilled onions or bacon added on top, I went with the bacon and it worked. Not fancy but very clean and nicely decorated. We just scratched the surface here starting with the perogi special, lots more pictures here. Yumbola.

Atmosphere: separated dining areas that give you a cozy feel in a large restaurant. There was soft music playing in the background and a muted baseball game at the bar.

Service: The staff was very knowledgeable regarding their menu. Our server was also very accommodating and professional. 

Food: pincho de solomillo, pollo de castilla, empanada de carne, los tres mosqueteros, Spanish rice, caramel flan, and mango sangria. The pincho de solomillo was delicious. The tender meat, soft dough, and crunchy fries combined perfectly in my mouth. The pollo de castilla was a bit too dry for me. However the los tres mosqueteros was perfect with the Spanish rice. The meats were juicy and the rice was soft. Yet their shining achievement was the empanada de carne. It was more of a meat pastry than the homemade empanadas my Hispanic friends&#39; mothers would make. The dough was flaky, sweet, and soft. The meat was tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. I never wanted it to end. As a bonus, the caramel flan was also a creamy heaven. The sangria was like any other. 

Overall: I will come again just for the empanada. I would even be here everyday if it wasn&#39;t on the expensive side!"

I&#39;ve been to a lot of &#34;tapas&#34; restaurants that are hipster divebars that serve tiny plates of unexceptional American-fusion food, all at a jacked up price.

So, take this 5-star review with the opposite of a grain of salt. This restaurant is stunningly good. As I dug into my macchiato (which the bar man nailed), I looked over a menu where I just couldn&#39;t order everything I wanted to order. I got 2 deserts, the nut cake and flan. Both were superb.

A note on authenticity. I&#39;ve never been to Europe, but I bet this place would fit right in as a Spain-Spanish restaurant. Espresso drinks on point, daring fish dishes on the menu. The beer list is practically all Spanish imports. This is the opposite of the lousy hipster tapas places I&#39;ve been to in the past, and I really appreciate that. 

For the record, I did not leave hungry."

I tried so very hard to be open-minded about this restaurant, but I kept getting this nagging feeling in the pit of my stomach.  Meh, I said as I tried to ignore this feeling and give a fair chance to La Tasca Restaurant.  To be totally honest, I probably would not have come here anyway were it not for a Groupon offer that my fiancé and I had been looped into getting.  I soon thereafter realized why I was never inclined to dine at this restaurant other than out of pure convenience...the quality of the food was not even close to comparable.

Of course, I didn&#39;t know this walking into the restaurant but that sixth sense told me I wasn&#39;t going to be having some phenomenal experience.  One of the very first indicators that La Tasca was going to fall in comparison was the taste (and perhaps size of the pitcher) of sangria.  Having had a long day at work, my fiancé and I were in desperate need of some sangria only this came out tasting like pure red wine with some ice cubes and cut-up apples tossed in there for shits and giggles.  With that being said, the sangria was not sweet, and in fact it was somewhat tart.  Secondly, the pitcher of sangria was tiny in comparison to the one at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba; at both places we paid about $27 for a pitcher, but unlike Café Ba-Ba-Reeba where we each got about 3-4 full glasses, this pitcher only served about 2 glasses per person.  It&#39;s kind of a rip-off when you think about it this way.

I hate to continuously make comparisons, but I feel it is the only way to judge this place.  The variety of offerings here was alright, but not phenomenal; with that being said we ordered four different tapas plates: the trio sausage plate, the meatballs, the beef and cheese empanada, and the octopus de galena.  The sausage plate was good, but some of the meats seemed a little rubbery.  The empanada was good, but could have been better had there been a greater amount of fillings in it; I&#39;d say that about half the empanada was nothing but the casing...albeit good because of its croissant-like texture.  The meatballs were delicious and I would have gladly had more!  But the best deal was definitely the octopus...this plate was only about $10 (similar to the others) and it was filled with octopus.  The octopus was cooked perfectly, and oh was it yummy!  I love me some tentacles.

Though we were already feeling the hurt after eating all these tapas, we had the paella Valencia...now, mind you - we had this same paella at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba and it was 100x better there.  Granted, the serving is enormous here, but the taste of the saffron was deficient.  Also, I hated how the chicken was left on it&#39;s bone when served in the dish - I don&#39;t want to have to take a break from shoveling the food in my mouth to peel the chicken off the bone.  I didn&#39;t even particularly enjoy the other meat in the paella; in fact, after eating it I began feeling pretty nauseous...and I felt this way again after warming up the leftovers later that night (which really stunk, by the way).  Not good.  Not good at all.  Thankfully, we ended on a good note with the rice pudding which was served with raspberry syrup atop it.  This rice pudding really was great - and perhaps the best part of the meal.  

I have to say that the service here was average, but nothing to blink an eye at.  There were points throughout the meal that our waiter was absent and other times when he was not.  Either way, our plates got taken out of our way in a timely manner.  That&#39;s really all I cared about as I didn&#39;t want to be overcrowded by dirty dishes.  Our server was also accommodating in that he didn&#39;t raise a stink when we handed him the Groupon ticket, cash and two credit cards.  

Basically, La Tasca isn&#39;t terrible, but it is not great.  I would reserve a trip to the city for a good tapas experience as this place leaves a lot to be desired."

So delicious and flavorful. Wish more baguettes were served with it, it was that good. Also, the chocolate custard which was so rich and a perfect end to the meal. Their red sangria was good as well. Pretty strong and not expensive at all.  
Our server was really nice. However, getting seated was slightly annoying. The hostess had originally told us it would be 15 min even with reservations which I was ok with. That 15 min wait turned into a 40 min wait. I would have just appreciated it if they were honest from the get go so we knew what to expect."

My most recent experience makes me think they have slide down a notch to 3 stars. I love me sum tapas but they have been around a while and think they have gotten comfortable. Just make it or premake it in many cases...churn it out...done attitude. Nothing really struck me as interesting any longer. The food was just Mehhh...oook...nothing stood out of the 6 tapas we tried. With all the restaurant competition they face they need to pick it back up. The fact we walked in on a Saturday nite @ 7:30 and it was 1/2 full makes me think others have realized this too. No longer the it place to be they need to introduce some new flavors and get creative to get back on track.

But the service I received the last time I was there WAS SO RUDE I&#39;LL NEVER GO BACK!!!!  It all started when my date and I were told we&#39;d have to wait 5 mins. Or so for a table - that&#39;s OK - I get it.

We then sat down at the bar and the bartender asked us what we wanted to drink.  We said we were just waiting for a table.  The bartender then rudely snapped &#34;well you can&#39;t sit here if you&#39;re not going to order a drink&#34;.

They have a large selection of vegetarian tapas, clearly marked, and at least 20 wines by the glass. The service was friendly and attentive, and the food was amazing - even the complimentary bread and olives they put out as soon as we sat down were stand out - fresh french bread, and a large bowl of olives. They even had a cup of olive forks at the table already (nice touch).
We ordered queso de habro al horno (baked goat cheese in tomato sauce), championes barcelona (mushrooms stuffed with spinach, pine nuts, and cheese), empanada de queso y espinica (spinach and cheese empanada) and the patatas aioli (potato salad). All were large portions, and they were served in ways slightly different than other restaurants, so even though most of these were standard tapas fare, La Tasca was distinctive. The mushrooms were in a saffron sauce, the goat cheese was served with tomato bread, the empanada was served on a bed of field greens salad. We finished by splitting the Creme Catalana de Chocolate, which we could have easily shared with a third person. Looking forward to going back!"

Waiters repeatedly reached over me/my food rudely to refill my water without saying a word..at least ask you if I would like a refill so I can move out of your way! One waiter spilled water clumsily on the floor which splashed all over my leg and didn&#39;t even acknowledge it. Waiter who took our order commented about how much food we ordered...rude...and when we were first seated, he made us feel rushed to order. He kept coming back after a minute or two asking if we were ready...we had never been there before (and he knew that bc he asked us) and the menu is big, so some leisurely time to explore the menu would have been nice. Plus, we were out for our wedding anniversary and with 3 small children, we don&#39;t get time out alone often...we didn&#39;t want to be rushed. 

Dining room was crowded (tables too close together/too many tables in that room), loud. It was so loud that my husband and I couldn&#39;t really have a conversation bc we couldn&#39;t hear each other. Also, we were seated RIGHT next to the kitchen...like, next to one of the counters where they were literally preparing food. I could have reached my arm out and touched the counter. Weird. 

Ordered wine, which was served to me in a small water glass (!?)...um, what ever happened to a wine glass?? The food came VERY fast, TOO fast. The tables are very small, certainly not big enough for multiple tapas at once. We felt like we had to eat very quickly to keep up with how fast everything was being brought to us, and to make room on the table.

The baked goat cheese with bread=delicious.
Some kind of scallops = flavorful sauce, scallops were a hair overdone (on the border of being chewy).
Some kind of shrimp= sauce also very good, but a bit heavy on the acidity (lemon).
Grilled calamari= TERRIBLE. Way overcooked, it was like chewing a rubberband. Sent it back.
Bacon wrapped dates= not enough savory (bacon) to balance the sweetness of the date and the red pepper sauce. 
Ordered a couple other things but don&#39;t know what they were called (some sausage trio that was disappointingly bland, and a chicken skewer thing over bland rice).

I definitely wouldn&#39;t recommend this for a leisurely time out/date since it&#39;s so loud and the rapid delivery of food makes you feel rushed. Not sure if I will return."

I was not disappointed at all!! Same authenticity and taste as the original country&#39;s cuisine, and the decor was on point! Lovely atmosphere and great views of downtown Arlington heights if you are sitting by a window. 

Sangria: the red one was absolutely refreshing and delicious. A pitcher size comes in a beautifully painted Spanish one as well. Perfect for 3 people to each have 2 glasses. There are also deals for $5 glasses on Tuesday I believe.

Patatas bravas: mmmm the sauce is what differentiates this Spanish dish from normal fried potatoes. Each restaurant in Barcelona had this staple, with slight differences in the taste, and La Tasca was very similar in its recipe. A must try for those new to tapasl- and a very safe dish that you really can&#39;t go wrong with.

Ensalada de la casa: a good starter house salad. Obviously very small though like the rest of the tapas dishes.

Gambas al ajillo: this shrimp dish was excellently marinated in a delicious garlic herb sauce. Another safe dish if you are iffy about seafood.

Pincho de pollo y chorizo: oh my goodness I usually don&#39;t like chicken but this was perfectly cooked and tender. Soft and juicy chicken with some yummy chorizo over flavorful yellow rice. Delicious.

With the complementary bread and olive dip, authentic atmosphere, and great tasting dishes- you can&#39;t go wrong here for a quick trip to barca without flying. The only thing is tapas are much more pricey in the U.S!"

We ordered the patatas bravas (so great), the empanada de carne (soft and savory), the queso de cabra al horno (came with pan con tomate which was astounding), but the star was the pulpitos a la gallega. I personally love seafood, but often many restaurants tend to overcook the octopus to the point it is super tough. Well, not these guys. The spices were just right, the char was on point, and the texture was so so so great. 

Service was also outstanding, our server had to leave as soon as he seated us and we did not even notice as there was no interruption in the service; both the owner and another server stepped in right away.

I came because I love Spanish paella, more like obsessed... for a great paella.  I ordered the seafood paella and to my disappointment, every seafood (clam, shrimp, mussels, scallops) were all overcooked and tasteless.  The whole dish was very salty and had a very fishy smell.  I wish they used better quality seafood.  Oh well.

Calamari
Stuffed mushrooms
Beef tenderloin
Bacon wrapped dates

Calamari and stuffed mushrooms were nice, though a little salty on the calamari.  The beef tenderloin was lukewarm and the bed of potato strings it sat on were cold and hard.  The bacon wrapped dates also were oil soaked and also a bit salty.   These are tweeks on the tapas where they could have been better, but the overall meal was OK as mentioned.

We requested to be seated in an area by where the band was playing. 
The restaurant is nice, lots of seating. 
Once seated we waited a while for our server. That was pretty much the theme of the night.... Waiting. We waited forever to place our order. Our server was taking care of a large group of about 20 people. I think he was concerned about them and not our party of six. 
Besides the long waiting periods I was not happy with my food. We went with tapas and everything I ordered was just meh. I&#39;ve had better tapas elsewhere. Sangria wasn&#39;t great either. The only thing that I was happy about was the band. Our dinner date turned into a night of dancing.

The food was very good and the selections were ample. The patatas braves were very good actually and the portions were adequate to large depending on what you ordered.  They had a grilled egg plant with a crispy, sweet glaze which was fantastic. Do try it and the grilled vegetable plate. 

The only down side was that it was very loud, partially because it was NY eve I suppose and the music was cranked way up.

Before we ordered and throughout our meal our waiter was average, came off nice and I didn&#39;t mind him. It wasn&#39;t until we got our bill that we had a problem. The waiter hand wrote in a suggested gratuity of 30% and then hand wrote the new total at the bottom of the bill. We didn&#39;t think he was that great/attentive of a waiter so we tipped 25% instead. The waiter had the nerve to come back to the table to tell us that he was $6 short of his suggested tip. 

If this was based only on the food, I would have given it one more star. We had about 8 different dishes and they were just average. Not the exact names but we had bacon wrapped dates (YUM, let&#39;s be honest though and say that anything wrapped in bacon is amazing!), one that was a goat cheese dip, beef tenderloin, spicy potatoes, a Spanish frittata one, a veggie dish, octopus w/paprika &amp; seafood paellas.

However, it popped up in some search results earlier today and the wave of unhappiness I felt compelled me to write something.

The best part of the dinner I had at La Tasca was sitting outside.  It was a beautiful night, and there are not enough opportunities in the Chicago area to eat outside.  That said, the noise of the Metra train and the heavy foot traffic of the commuters walking by after getting off the train hurt whatever ambiance there was.

Everything we ordered was either average or downright bad.  The sangria was flavorless.  The calamari steak had a little bit of a fishy odor, but it was nothing compared to the octopus.  I cannot remember the last time I returned a dish to the kitchen, but the octopus smelled bad and did not taste right.  We had to send it back.

The spinach and pine nut stuffed mushrooms were okay, but bland.  The only other item I had was the beef tenderloin special.  As with the mushrooms - relatively flavorless.

Our server disappeared at the end of the meal.  The other server whom we asked to find our waiter was exceptionally more attentive for the two minutes he was engaged with us.

Last week I had dinner at El Tapeo in Oak Brook - incidentally on the same night that Yelp was having some sort of event there.  El Tapeo beat the hell out of La Tasca, and this contributed to my wanting to write something.  I am surprised by some of the positive reviews here.  Maybe La Tasca had an off night.  I doubt I&#39;ll ever know - I don&#39;t plan on returning."

The kitchen was slammed, so the food came out in shifts, which we were thankful for as it allowed time for conversation.  The scallop dish was marvelous, fantastic, the best thing on the menu.  The olives &amp; olive juice were quite tasty too, but the other dishes, beef tenderloin, pork medallions &amp; tuna were all over-cooked to the point of being tough.  The cheesy potatoes were very nice as was the flat bread too.  The dessert was so-so as the cake was hard.

In the end they made it right and changed our minds about giving them another chance. No one or business is perfect and sometimes people (hostess) have bad days so we feel our review needed an update to give them credit for what they did do right... but we also feel the original review should stay so they can work harder to avoid this again.

Original

Don&#39;t bother with a reservation since they don&#39;t know how to save tables. We got there a little early for our 7pm reservation and they told us they were backed up and our table would not be ready for 30 mins. 10 mins  is one thing but 30...come on...don&#39;t seat all the walk ins. It really isn&#39;t that difficult. We convinced them to call us when the table was ready and went to a bar for drinks across the street. They called at 7:43pm to tell us our table was almost ready and that the table was eating dessert.. We insisted they call back when they paid because dessert can take 20mins....the hostess finally agreed after saying that they don&#39;t typically do the calling thing. We were right across the street so come on. We waited and waited and never got another call....so we just ate somewhere else. The hostest was terrible. Never empathized with us, never offered anything to make it right... Just did not care...a very bad hire by management. Though I hear the food is good...sadly,  we did not get to experience any of it."

Easy to find location, its right on the corner, but parking can be a pain.  I do believe they offer valet though.  It isn&#39;t a huge establishment, but they made the most of their space and it is very cozy and romantic. This would be a cute place for a first date.

Ordered a ton of food with some girlfriends.  At first, I was really impressed, everything was super tasty, however I just started to notice that most of the things we ordered had the same sauce and there would only be 3 or 4 of the pastry (and for $8?!?).  Food was never cold and always did come out pretty quickly, I just got super full off the same sauce.  But then there would  be different meals like the Beef Tenderloin that was greatly priced and very good.

I want to come back, but definitely order different items."

Reservations were at 7:00  we were seated at 7:20 ish  but had a great time at the bar and had a couple Sangrias  with the party of 7 that we were.
We sat down  and our waiter was excellent ,   The Bus staff was on top of the cleaning up the empty plates,water etc...   The food was  excellent  everything we had from  salads to the grilled calamari, to the beef tenderloins,  actually we probably had a couple  of everything  bacon wrapped figs, Quaso dip,  I can&#39;t say the food just came  coming until someone said that they couldn&#39;t eat anything else , So we all had  the Plantain/ ice cream  dish  which I have to say it was a Banana  and not a real Plantain But I don&#39;t care they taste similar anyway  and the chocolate custard  desert with the carmelized sugar topping which was great, il go back here more often as  this time was probably the best its been, and the place was packed  on a Saturday during a snow storm  on 1/9/16

I like tapas as a concept because I enjoy variety, but the dishes are priced highly enough that you don&#39;t end up ordering many different things.  It was my birthday though, and therefore the best opportunity for a splurge at La Tasca.  The ambiance was lovely to look at, but a bit loud.  Our server, Mike, was excellent.  Our tapas selections were: 

PLATO DE JAMÓN Y QUESO MANCHEGO (Plate of Serrano ham and Manchego cheese) - Comparable to a plate of prosciutto and thinly sliced Parmesan cheese.  Overpriced for what it was.  Skip it!

QUESO DE CABRA AL HORNO (Herbed goat cheese baked in a tomato basil sauce, served with tomato baguettes) - This was well-loved by our table, especially since you could dip the bread from the never-ending bread bowl in it once the tomato baguettes were gone.

ENSALADA DE PULPO (Cold Octopus Salad) - Very good.  If you&#39;ve ever had this dish at a Greek restaurant, it is essentially the same thing.

EMPANADA DE QUESO Y ESPINACA (Spinach, goat cheese, and golden raisins baked in a light pastry puff) - This was one of our table&#39;s favorite dishes.  The sweet raisins especially added a nice punch.  Kind of like a tiropita with spinach and raisins.

The big problem with this tapas arrangement is that we tried to split everything between 6 people so we could all savor the novelty, but that required everyone to be very frugal with their portion sizes.  With each dish at around $10 a piece, just ordering two of everything would have added up quickly, so mostly we were all able to just get a &#34;taste&#34; without being able to feel fulfilled.

Luckily we also ordered the seafood paella (as others have mentioned, all the paellas take 40 minutes to cook, so order this immediately if you plan to have it).  The paella is $15 &#34;per person&#34; with a two person minimum to order the dish.  However, according to our waiter, each per person serving actually serves two people.  So for our table of six we ordered a three person serving of paella which more than fed all of us, and we even took some to go.  If not for the tasty paella we probably would have left hungry, so this was the perfect finale for our dinner.  Just a word of caution, though: for some reason I expected this dish to be spicy.  I think because last time I had paella it was some cajun-style version.  This dish was not spicy in any way, so that is good news for spice-wimps and bad news if spicy was what you were craving.

Because it was my birthday they brought out a caramel flan with a candle at the end.  Very thoughtful and we all agreed that was some of the best flan we&#39;d ever had!

I am not sure if I&#39;ll ever have the sort of disposable income that would make me want to come here regularly, but I know they do have Groupons and in any case it was worth doing at least once."

I&#39;ve been going here for years and I moved out of state 5 years ago. I have my list of &#34;must eat&#34; while I am in town, and La Tasca is on it. I love that you can go with friends and try all sorts of different things. It&#39;s a fun experience as well as a great meal. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the extensive and unique menu. The bar area is great for hanging with friends and the restaurant area is great for a quiet dinner date. The owner always recognizes me as a regular and makes a stop at my table to chat, even though my visits are over a year apart these days.  

I think I&#39;ve tried about every tapas on the menu and don&#39;t think I could pick a favorite. For my most recent visit we did the 5 for $40 deal, which is 5 tapas for $40. It&#39;s a great way to try something you might be unsure about without the risk of ending up with a meal that you don&#39;t like (although I&#39;ve never had anything I didn&#39;t like). If I had to recommend any specific dish, try the bacon wrapped dates or the scallops. Ask for extra bread with the scallops because you will want to soak up every drop of the delicious sauce :)

Thanks for a great meal, and I&#39;ll see ya the next time I&#39;m in town!"

No one was overly friendly but they were on top of giving us bread refills and letting us keep the menu and order more when we finished our first round of tapas (my boyfriend and I are big eaters) and we never had to flag down anyone, but I didn&#39;t feel like they were hovering. I honestly really like that, I don&#39;t want a forced conversation with my waiter when I&#39;m on a date. 4 stars only because I personally really didn&#39;t care for the decor and ambiance, and we didn&#39;t get seated at a booth even though the place was basically empty.

I&#39;ve had dishes that were delicious, dishes that we&#39;re good, and dishes that I felt were indelible (don&#39;t get the eggplant with seafood medley).  Once I was lucky enough to receive a rubber band in my glass of water!  I have yet to receive exceptional service, which you would expect from a restaurant similar to La Tasca.

Some of the choices can be a real miss, so just take my word on what to get.

*Queso de Cabra al Horno - herbed goat cheese that has been baked with a flavorful tomato sauce, and served with baguette slices.

*Empanadas de Carne - lamb, pork, and beef within a light puff pastry, and served atop a tomato basil sauce.  This happens to be the last item on the hot appetizers so don&#39;t miss it.

*Mejillones a la Mallorquina - juicy mussels in a spicy tomato vegetable broth, filled with peppers.

*Vieiras Gratinadas - sautéed sea scallops in a vegetable bechemel and topped off with manchego cheese and bread crumbs. Warning, these are good, but probably a result of all the butter used.

*Platanos al Caramelo - a perfectly sautéed  banana and ice cream, topped off with a caramel drizzle and pistachios.  

*Caramel Flan (or any flavor of the day flan) - a cool, smooth, creamy, and delectable treat!

Always check their specials for some good tapas that you may not be able to get otherwise."

The atmosphere is very welcoming and comfortable and everyone is very nice. We love tapas and were not disappointed!  We tried a little bit of everything - 

- Embutidos y quesos variados (meat and cheese plate) - this was my favorite; it sounds so simple, but the marinated peppers, meats, olives, and cheeses were so yummy together! They give you a full basket of bread to go along with all the tapas and it was perfect with the meat and cheese plate!
 
- Calamres a la romana (lightly breaded calamari) - these were very good as well

- Gambas al ajillo (Shrimp sautéed with garlic, red pepper, white wine and olive oil)- this was really good and had a good kick to it! The bread is tasty dipped in the leftover sauce.

- Pincho de pollo y chorizo (chicken tenderloin and Chorizo served over Spanish rice)- really yummy and flavorful! 

- Croquetas de pollo (Chicken and ham croquettes)- these were not very good. I wonder if we just got some not so tasty ones, because they are in other peoples&#39; positive reviews, but we weren&#39;t very impressed. They were very bland and had an off texture. 

Overall, a great experience with very good food. We will be back!

I love tapas and this place tries to educate the consumer on the tapas style of eating.  But the food is uninspired and bland. Multiple dishes covered in the same sauce and none of it tasting authentic.  The crowd seems to like it here, but if you&#39;re looking for tapas like you&#39;ve had in Spain, pick the other tapas restaurant around the corner... Much better food."

I&#39;m always looking for variety and trying a little bit of everything, so it&#39;s perfect.

The food and service was great. Not sure why there are so many bad reviews?

We actually came here thinking our Groupon was for this tapas restaurant, but it was actually for the tapas place right around the corner. I guess we&#39;ll be having tapas again soon LOL.

They start you off with some bread and olives. Already points for free anything! haha. 

Ordered everything from the Tapas Calientes Menu, because we be muy caliente!!!~ We on fiyaaaaa. In order of my favorites to my least favorites, altho all were good:

Mejillones a la mallorquina: A lot of mussels in a delicious sauce that I could seriously drink. Table favorite!!!

Croquetas de pollo: these chicken and ham croquettes were one of our favorites. Crispy on the outside, hot and steamy on the inside. Great tomato basil sauce on top.

Delicias andaluzas: bacon-wrapped dates. Love the combination of the sweetness of the dates and the saltiness of the bacon.

Pincho de solomillo con champinones y cebollitas: Beef tenderloin with sour cream sauce -- the meat was juicy and tender. Just the way I like it!

Empanada de carne: beef, lamb and pork ground meat empanada. Again that tomato basil sauce was delicious and went well with this empanada. The only reason why I made this last place is that it&#39;s hard for me to enjoy lamb or any of the more &#34;gamey&#34; meats."

Lots of delicious tapas that includes some of the typical ones (patatas bravas &amp; bacon wrapped dates) but also some that you don&#39;t normally find at other restaurants (the seafood ones).

I&#39;m usually pretty wary about ordering seafood in salad form but the &#34;Berenjena Rellena con Salpicon de Mariscos&#34;, a seafood medley over grilled eggplant, was actually pretty fresh and tasty.  You can never go wrong with the bacon wrapped dates that come with a red pepper sauce.  Can you really ever go wrong with anything that&#39;s wrapped in bacon?  Is it even possible?  Bacon aside, every dish I&#39;ve had here I&#39;ve enjoyed.

Decor/Ambiance-wise it has a very classy look.  They tend to dim the lights at night so it tends to be a little dark (I guess you can call it &#34;romantic&#34;).  It can also get busy around dinner-time so you can expect a wait.  With the seeming mass of people there at times seating can be a little cramped, and it can get a little loud inside.

Overall awesome tapas that&#39;s conveniently located!"

We were excited to see that La Tasca was open until midnight, so we started heading towards downtown Arlington Heights.  When we arrived, there was only one other table occupied.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere was inviting and cozy.

We asked for suggestions on which dishes to order.  I was in love with the fact that they had different flavors of sangria!  I ordered Pineapple sangria (pineapple is always my favorite flavor when it comes to alcoholic beverages).  The boyfriend ordered the Pomegranate so we could try a red and white sangria.  Both were very good.  The extra flavoring was sweet, but not overwhelming.

All of the dishes we ordered were really good, the only one I was not that impressed with was the goat cheese.  That is only because you can get that almost anywhere."

We went into this dinner with a positive, but not over-excited perspective.

La Tasca was... fine.

It seemed that for every good thing that happened in the restaurant an equal and opposite (read: bad) thing happened.  Let me be specific: The white sangria was good (and I usually don&#39;t like it).  However, the waiter (on a weekday night without that many tables) was rude... to us.  He was perfectly agreeable to everyone else.  Each time he came by (which was not often), I smiled and used more words than I needed to highlighting the things that they did right (some of the dishes were very good, but they did not get cleaned out of the way quickly).  By the end, I felt like I was doing all of the work.  

If there was a better service experience, another trip could help isolate which dishes are really amazing, which could help the disconnected wait staff."

I often cook it when entertaining. So when we had theater tickets in Arlington Heights I was pleased to find La Tasca just a block from the theater.

We ordered a few of our favorites - Patatas Bravas, Chaminones Barcelona. We tried a special: goat cheese rolled in eggplant with tomato sauce; a spinach and raisin empanada, steak with shoe string potatoes. Every dish was served hot and with with nice timing. They arrived every few minutes and as we ordered more we had a changing buffet on our table. The stuffed mushrooms were good but a bit plain, but everything else was outstanding.

For dessert I had sauteed banana with ice cream which was very, very good. The caramel sauce is killer. My wife had a honey-nut tart which surprised us. Expecting a warm tart with chocolate sauce, instead e got what looked like a slice of nut cake with fudge frosting. In fact, it was an upside down tart with a fudgy-chocolate layer over the crust. Absolutely delicious. However, it comes with whipped cream when what it really needs is ice cream. It is very rich. But I&#39;d definitely order it again!"

Upon arrival we were told they were backed up and it would be another 30 minutes. When we asked why this was the case, (the RBF and incredibly unfriendly hostess) told us we were &#34;lucky&#34; as those without reservations were looking at at least an hour and a half wait. Well, don&#39;t we feel lucky then. No apology though. So, we get it...shit happens.... but NO apology and nothing but attitude despite our being understanding of the wait. We then asked if they could call us when they were ready for us so that we could go just half a block away for some drinks. We received a call at 7:43pm (again, we had 7pm reservations). The hostess mentioned that the table they were waiting on for us was on dessert and that we should head over. When I asked her to call when the table was ready (again, within a block from there), she said &#34;we don&#39;t do that. We don&#39;t actually usually call at all&#34;. I then asked if they could call when the table had at least paid their check. Having previously worked in the industry,  I know that dessert can easily mean another 20-40+ minutes. She hesitated, said fine,  then hung up. Now 2 hours 24 minutes later (with a reservation) we have yet to receive a call. Very disappointing and can&#39;t believe how rude the hostess was. Non-empathetic, rude, and now....just forgetful. We are literally half a block away and just eating here. I wish I had her name. After the number of years I&#39;ve had in the industry, this is the last type of person they should have on staff. But happy bday to my sister who was a trooper and accepted just having dinner elsewhere. *update: 10:22pm.... still no call*"

I mean, c&#39;mon.  How hard is it to buy bread from a bakery?  There have got to be some in the area.

My boyfriend and I spotted an employee walking back to the restaurant carrying several loaves of bread from Jewel, which is located right across from the restaurant.  I was really hoping that he wasn&#39;t going into La Tasca, but he was.  And, I hate to say it, but that awful bread definitely bumped my star rating down a notch.  I&#39;m really hoping that they simply ran out of bread that night and had to resort to Jewel bread.

First, their menu definitely seems a lot more limited than other tapas restaurants.  I had no qualms with the decor and liked the bold, bright paintings that hung from the walls.  The background music confused me at times because they&#39;d play more contemporary and techno music as opposed to the traditional Spanish music that I think should be playing at a tapas restaurant.

For our tapas, we ordered:

- Queso de Cabra Al Horno: goat cheese baked in tomato basil sauce served with tomato baguettes.  This is my favorite dish ever at tapas places.  Theirs was good, but not great.  The bread really did this dish in.  I wish that the bread been toasted a bit with some oil.  It had some of the sauce on it, but it seemed like it was put on as an after thought and not baked into the bread.

- Pincho de Solomillo Con Champinones Y Cebollitas: beef tenderloin, mushrooms, pearl onions topped with Spanish sour cream cause and served over shoestring potatoes.  I really enjoyed this dish and thought everything worked well together.  The pork was cooked perfectly and I loved the crunch of the shoestring potatoes.

- Champinones Rellenos: stuffed mushrooms with ground pork tenderloin and pine nuts and marinated in a Spanish brandy.  I&#39;m a big fan of mushrooms and pine nuts so I enjoyed this dish a lot.  The ground pork had a little crisp on the outside, which I enjoyed.

- Gambas Al Ajillo: shrimp sauteed with garlic, red pepper, white wine and olive oil.  Overall, just OK - a little too heavy on all the sauces though.

For dessert, I had the Platanos Al Caramelo, which is a sauteed banana and homemade ice cream topped with caramel and pistachios.  The banana was gross and did not taste fresh.  I really did not like how it was sauteed nor how it was presented.  The whole banana was on the plate.  I thought it would have been nicer it it was sliced.  Everything else was good, but I seriously struggled to finish it.

Service was just OK - our server checked up on us and was nice, but didn&#39;t go out of her way to be too friendly.

I had a $15 Groupon so the cost was cut down by a little bit.  After the discount and tip, we spent a little over $30.  That&#39;s not a bad price, but the food and the whole experience was just so-so.  I might give them another shot if I was in the area and craving tapas, but I definitely think there are far better tapas places out there."

We ordered 4 tapas and 1 bowl of soup and were already over the amount we had to spend. The food was alright, no trip to Hollywood, but not bad. However, there was no substance or protein to fill you up. The service was bad. Our server looked down on us like we were less of a customer because we were young and had a Groupon.

I loved the seasoned, toasted bread &amp; the gooey tomato &amp; goat cheese sauce.  I&#39;ve tried this dish at other tapas restaurants, but the bread at La Tasca soaked up the sauce nicely.  The empanadas de carne were average.  The calamari was quite good (the sauce made it all the better).  The mussels were alright (the broth was good, but the mussels themselves were puny).

It is by far, my favorite restaurant in the area, if not in general.  I never get sick of this place and have eaten there as many times as 3 times a week!  Last  month alone I went 4 times.  Danny the owner is the nicest guy, and really appreciates his customers and regulars. The bartendar (can&#39;t remember his name) is very friendly and attentive, and fun to talk to.  The atmosphere is welcoming and I always feel comfortable here.  My gf&#39;s and I have gone straight from the gym, and I have also gone dressed up for date night.  I wouldn&#39;t go in gym clothes on the weekend, but during the week it was fine. The wine is superb.  The food is DELICIOUS!!!  I have tried many different small plates (that&#39;s my favorite), but here are my top reccomendations. 

Patatas bravas - perfectly crispy potatoes with a cayenne sauce.  These are a must have!!  We sometimes get two orders, for two of us!

Queso de cabra - herbed goat cheese dip.  AMAZING!!!  Don&#39;t miss this one.

Calamares a la Romana - My favorite calamari ever!  The dipping sauce is heavenly

Trio of Sausages - DELICOUS!!

BACON WRAPPED DATES!!!  - I CAN&#39;T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THESE.  Get these as your final round and it tastes like dessert....  but speaking of dessert, don&#39;t skip that!!  The banana dessert is wonderful! 

They have many other dishes, but those are my favorites.  My mouth is watering as I type this!!  

Don&#39;t miss out on La Tasca&#39;s food, atmosphere, and drinks!!  It&#39;s a must go to for date night, or with a group."

We started off with the guacamole which was made quickly and with perfect consistency. I had the poblano burrito which I couldn&#39;t even make a dent on because of their chips, salsa, and guacamole we ordered. Made for great leftovers though

My best friend and I stopped in on a Friday evening for some drinks and food. 
I had been dying to check out Salsa 17, since moving to Arlington Heights in June. 

We grabbed a high-top in the bar area and were ready for an ice-cold margarita!
The place was PACKED, but not uncomfortably so. 
We both ordered a &#34;Mexican Bulldog&#34; margarita. 
For those who are wondering, it&#39;s a signature margarita with a corona tipped upside down. Essentially, infusing your margarita with Corona! Truly great! 
We could have essentially shared one between us, however we were thirsty! ;) 

We chatted it up while sipping our margarita and enjoying the chips and salsa. 
The salsa was more authentic than the competition next door. (ahem..Mago) 
We loved it so much we asked for a refill on the salsa! 

Next, we started getting really hungry and knew it was time to try some bomb tacos! We ordered the taco platter. It was excellent and plenty of food for two. 

I would definitely come back for the excellent margaritas. If you&#39;re looking for great margaritas and tasty tacos in Arlington Heights, be sure to check out Salsa 17!"

My husband is big on Mexican food and we are regulars here. We come here, tired from work or feeling too lazy to cook and we leave here with a full and satisfied tummy. We order tableside guac, salmon/chicken with pistachio mole sauce. Both are always good, salmon &amp; chicken cooked to the point. The mexican rice that comes with the entree is delicious too.

They have a very good margarita selection, try to get one when you can. 

Good place, good service, good food!! Definitely will go back!!"

Personally, I&#39;m not big on Mexican food. But we were nearby at my brother and sister-in-law&#39;s house, and my partner loves Mexican food. So I agreed to go and I have zero regrets.

We came on a Friday night. My brother called to try and make a reservation, but they were no longer taking any. We decided to risk a long wait and came here. We parked only 3 or 4 blocks away. There was an outdoor festival going on, so we maybe had to park farther only because of the event.

We arrived at the perfect time. They were able to seat us almost instantly and then proceeded to have a line of people out the door. The menu has a great variety, and one of the best things is that vegetarian and vegan options are abundant for my brother.

We all ordered something different. I went with enchiladas which were great. I forget what everyone else got. I sometimes don&#39;t like the complimentary salsa and end up eating chips. But the salsa was amazing, so we probably split like four orders worth.

I don&#39;t eat guacamole. You&#39;ll probably stop reading at this point, but I know that everyone else raved about how good it was. They also make it fresh at your table which it quite cool and hip these days.

My favorite thing about this dinner is that they had fruit smoothies on the menu. I used to gulp down margaritas like there was no tomorrow. But I got to be too good of a drinker and had to retire my title. So now I prefer the non-alcoholic drinks which a lot of places don&#39;t have on the menu. I was able to get a yummy mango strawberry smoothie with dinner.

The food here is top notch. It&#39;s a little more pricey than I normally look for in a dinner place, but it was definitely worth every cent.

I would just recommend making a reservation and plan to have some great food, good atmosphere, and killer salsa (and probably also the guacamole)."

OK, so time for the pro tips. #1, this place gets crowded and loud at night. I&#39;m not a crowds guy. If you&#39;re like me, eat early and have a reservation.

Far more importantly... You&#39;re probably eating the fajitas. I don&#39;t blame you, they&#39;re delicious. But you&#39;ll be stuffed by the time the waitress asks about dessert because the portions are huge, so you&#39;ll say something like &#34;gracias pero no.&#34; But you are making a TERRIBLE MISTAKE since the chocolate lava cake here is literally the BEST ANYWHERE, EVER.

I&#39;ve had serious discussions with my fiance about just ordering the chocolate cake slice for delivery. Oh yeah, they do delivery! But seriously though, the pastel will change your life for the better. Or maybe the worse if you&#39;re on a diet. 

Think melty, pure chocolate cut into a wedge that resembles black cheesecake. I&#39;m not describing it right. Think pure, elemental chocolate, hot enough to be slightly melted, but not hot enough to melt the whip cream. I could right poetry about Salsa 17&#39;s chocolate cake, and I just might. You should definitely try it!"

Came here for lunch today with some of my coworkers, got a corn tortilla steak dish with cactus lettuce on top. I don&#39;t recall what it&#39;s called but that the description of it.

Service wasn&#39;t bad. Waiters and the manager that came out were both friendly. The waiter frequently came around to refill water. Overall pleased with service.

On to my favorite part, the food! The dish I got was quite pleasant. The shredded steak was well seasoned, not dry, the cactus salad had a nice kick to it that complemented the steak well, the tortilla it was on was nice and puffy all topped by some good green sauce.

Overall, this place is worth a visit &amp; definitely a return. I left 4 stars to allow for room for improvement. When I return, they may be worthy of earning 5 stars."

The restaurant had changed management and had no way to confirm that we weren&#39;t cheating with our printout.  So the $20 face value was negotiated to $10.  So I guess the message is we think our customers are cheaters.

Now for the review: the Azul Margarita was very enjoyable.  The at-table guacamole was outstanding.  The salsa and chips were upscale.  The chile relleno with lamb was creative with a properly prepared pepper.  My partner&#39;s pork taco delighted.  The coconut flan so good.

And then there was the matter of our Groupon.

Four stars.

Come back?  No.  I don&#39;t think so.  Hospitality does not seem to be the restaurant&#39;s hallmark."

I thought this place was going to be decent, but it was beyond my expectation. I had the carne asada, perfectly cooked amd seasoned, medium rare. But it was a bit too greasy. But this is one of the best carne asada I&#39;ve ever had. Their chips &amp; guacs are made fresh, and the horchata was yummy! They also have vegetarian options. Downside is that it was really busy in there, and we had to wait awhile for the food."

The chips and salsa were fantastic and the main event also didn&#39;t disappoint.  My husband had sizzling fajitas and I had a burrito filled with steak.  Only complaint was that the neighboring table got an order of fajitas as we were in the middle of eating our meal and the smoke drifted directly at our table...it would have been alright but it seemed that it was a bit overcooked, so we were inundated with a burning smell as we tried to enjoy our meal.  I do bet this was just some bad luck and wouldn&#39;t hesitate to go back and give it another try."

My dining companion, K, and I yelped restaurants in the Arlington Heights area and found Salsa 17.  I later realized that I had walked past it many times when dining in downtown AH and just never stopped in.  We were seated immediately upon arrival but waited a good 5-10 minutes before our waiter arrived but besides that service was very good.  K and I started off with some drinks; he had a Modelo and I opted for red sangria.  His Modelo was a bit watered down but I enjoyed my sangria.  It could have had a little more fruit in it but had a nice balance between sweetness and dryness.  

As for entrees, I ordered the tamales verdes (I think that was the name??) which was filled with pulled pork and came with sides of black beans and Mexican rice.  The portions were generous and much bigger than I expected!  I only was able to finish one tamale and took the other 2 home. The tamales were flavorful with tender pork and the Mexican rice colorful with diced veggies.  I would definitely order the tamales again whether it be the same ones or a different filling.   K cleaned off his plate of chicken enchiladas so it&#39;s safe to assume that he thoroughly enjoyed it.  

Service was quick and efficient and I had no complaints.  The manager (I assume) stopped by our table later in the evening to check on us and ask how our food was.  I always appreciate when management makes an appearance because it shows they care.  She was very sweet and thought I didn&#39;t like my food since I only ate one tamale.  Little did she know I was saving room for the most important part of the day...DESSERT! 

I recommend stopping by Salsa 17 for a GNO, date night, or basically any sort of occasion.  It&#39;s a fun, laid back atmosphere in a great location and I don&#39;t think you could go wrong with anything you order."

I always get tacos, they are a good serving size and are always juicy. I can never finish my meal and end up taking them home

Let me start out by saying our waiter, Miguel, was attentive, personable, professional and is a great asset to your restaurant, which was very much appreciated in the events to follow. 

My friend and I both ordered the tilapia fish tacos. Halfway into eating the first taco, I noticed some green spots on the second taco and showed my friend. We actually spent a good 5 minutes contemplating... perhaps it was the purple color of the cabbage or was it a fleck from something else that was on the taco? We didn&#39;t want to cause any issues but after examining it further, the coloring of the cabbage isn&#39;t green nor does it have a fuzzy look to it. My friend then began to examine her tortillas and found green on the edges of hers as well. I asked to see our waiter to which he was quick to respond to this concern. He apologized and said he would have them remade on flour tortillas. 

A few minutes later, Jessica (the manager) approached our table with our plates of moldy tacos in her hands and Miguel trailing behind her. She placed the plates in front of us and said that she &#34;PROMISES&#34; it isn&#39;t mold, and that it&#39;s the purple dye from the cabbage. We responded and said we understood that the cabbage can bleed onto the tortilla (and saw purple on the tortilla where the cabbage was) but that cabbage is purple and the spots in question were green, fuzzy and on the edges of the tortilla, which were not touching the food on the tortilla. She just stood at our table insisting it wasn&#39;t mold and it was clear then that nothing would be done. 

When we brought this issue to our waiter&#39;s attention, I was pleased with the way he handled it. But once the manager became involved, it went down a steep hill. Honestly, had they just remade the tacos with the flour tortillas, I wouldn&#39;t have even written this and would have just chalked it up to &#34;stuff happens&#34;.  I also have a problem with the fact that our plates were taken from our table, out of our sight, then brought back for us to eat. We don&#39;t know where they were, who touched them etc so not only were we expected to eat the moldy tortillas but who knows what else? 

This situation was handled very poorly by a member of your management team; someone who should be an example for everyone else. Jessica was the complete opposite of Miguel; displayed attitude, was extremely unprofessional in that no matter what we said to her, she kept &#34;promising&#34; it wasn&#39;t mold and dismissed our concerns. I really do not feel we were asking for much in this situation... simply for the meal to be remade without moldy tortillas. It sounds like such a simple solution and yet it was apparently impossible. I had not been to Salsa 17 in quite awhile but I can tell you that I will not be back. Not just because of the moldy tortilla but rather because of how this situation was handled by Jessica. This is completely unacceptable."

I give it only 4 stars because we had a problem with the margaritas. They were way too sweet and didn&#39;t taste fresh. It was unfortunate because when I want Mexican food, it needs to be paired with a bomb margarita. Unfortunately Salsa 17 fell short there but we got the combo platter of tacos and they were all fantastic. I&#39;ll definitely be back, and will probably try the margaritas again. Maybe they were having a bad day. We also got and order of the table side guacamole. It was so good! There&#39;s something about getting fresh gauc made right in front of you.

I decided that the only way to appropriately rate this place is based on the quality of the food.  We ordered a main speciality, the seasoned salmon, as well as a more moderately priced item, an Al pastor burrito.  The waiter that served us was amazing, making a 2 star review difficult, but I want them to know that their wait staff is very good all the same.  

The salmon was poorly seasoned (dry rub of black pepper, paprika, and Cayenne pepper, really not fitting the fish) on a plate full of mashed potatoes and corn niblets.  The plate was almost two feet long, and only 6inches wide.  Making us both laugh, as we tried to angle the ridiculous thing on the table.  The potatoes were the only edible food on the plate.  The salmon was dry, overcooked, and flavorless.  Half of the plate is occupied by oily deep fried spinach, which was very crunchy, but also flavorless and literally dripping with fryer oil.

This together would have made this restaurant a 3 star affair, as the atmosphere and staff were so good (as well as the margaritas), however the burrito was the worst I have ever had.  It tasted like moldy cheese and mothballs.  I love burritos.  I&#39;ll eat them from nice places, fast food joints, wherever.  This was a burrito in shape only.  It tasted more like wet cardboard with bland salsa and chunks of tire for meat.  The rice on the plate was exactly like you&#39;d get from a Goya box, and the refried beans were no better (actually, that&#39;s not fair to Goya, as their food prepared correctly tastes pretty good, this was more like reheated leftovers that were left to sit out under a heat lamp for an hour).  The guacamole was also flavorless, like a green mayo, with a few half inch chunks of avocado.

All together I just couldn&#39;t believe how bad this food was, especially for the price.  With two drinks and two  meals, the whole thing came to nearly 80 dollars, not including tip.  I don&#39;t plan to come back.

TL;DR: bad food, high prices, you&#39;d be happier with Taco Bell."

I think the dishes are consistently good (sometimes, a little too salty), the chips &amp; salsa are awesome, and the tableside guac is some of the best I&#39;ve had. Some of my favorite dishes include the tamales and enchiladas of all varieties. I do have to say the chile relleno can use some improvement (especially when you compare it to Mago&#39;s down the street).

The only complaints I have are 1) the drinks are not cheap (avg $10) and I&#39;ve never seen specials on them. Be prepared to spend some coin if you&#39;re planning on drinking. 2) When the restaurant is not busy, the service is painstakingly slow. We were there on a Sunday for an early dinner and there was one waitress serving 8 tables. We should have known something was up when the people next were fuming when they left and the waitress kept apologizing. I like to take my time with my meal but not for 2 hours when I have a child with me.

There is outdoor seating down the alley, which is surprisingly charming, with plants and lights.  However, the tables are pretty tiny.  It can be a chore to get all the food and drinks to fit.  They don&#39;t supply a gluten-free menu, but the servers are very knowledgable, and are always willing to run back to the kitchen and ask about a specific dish.  (For example, I believe most of the moles and the chips are off-limits, but many other sauces are ok.)  They have luscious made-at-the-table guacamole.  This gives you a chance to get it customized.  No cilantro-no problem.  Double the jalapeños-right on!  The service has been fine when we have been.  It&#39;s not always that speedy, but just take another sip of your cerveza and enjoy the ambiance.  The walls have been painted with a unique combination of men and women from Mexico&#39;s past.  Caballeros, banditos, dancers, actresses, and more all leap larger than life size from the warm orange-toned background.

And I&#39;ll be eating it for several more days - it was huge! The servers were very nice, warm, friendly - even participating in some of our pranks (it was work people I had in my party). Even at the end when we were finishing up our drinks standing at the bar the bartender was so friendly. For me the only downside as a patron is there were a lot of little kids there on a Friday night so I guess it&#39;s good for families.

Went for dinner on a Wednesday night around 7pm and I&#39;d say at least half the tables were occupied, so pretty good sign considering it&#39;s the middle of the week. 

The decor is adorable and really a sight! Huge sombrero &amp; tequila bottle on the walls, awesome paintings/graphics, very clean space, and great food &amp; drinks! 

While walking to our table, another had a cart beside it filled with ingredients: fresh table-side guacamole! We ordered it and it was really good, chunky guac. You can customize to put how ever much or little you want of each ingredient.

We ordered a margarita with ginger and, I believe, peach. I could smell the ginger; very gingery &amp; refreshing. Also got the sangria roja (red sangria), also really good. Also tried the classic margarita with salt rim; yummm. 

Our server brought out tortilla chips with a dark purpleish/black salsa and it was amazing! I loved it. A bit spicy, but not too much. I have no idea why it was the color it was, but so good, I meant to ask if I could buy a jar of it! We had to have seconds. 

I asked our server which Mole sauce she liked best or which one was most popular and she brought out four of them for us to try. OMG. I love them all. They are so interesting in flavor, especially that chocolate, nutty one, the Poblano. The story behind it is interesting, too. Legend says that a nun had to prepare a meal for an archbishop. She emptied her cupboards and mixed a bunch of ingredients to obtain unique flavors. I ended up ordering the Mole Poblano (chocolate one) with Arrachera (skirt steak.) The meat was cooked to my liking &amp; good quality. I still had the sample Mole sauces and used them all with the steak, along with some of the guacamole. Also got to try the Arrachera Chihuahua with mushrooms, peppers &amp; melted cheese. All so good! Black beans came in a cute edible tortilla dish. 

I was too stuffed for dessert, but want to go back &amp; try the apple empanada, a special (especially since the last one I had was from Taco Bell &amp; literally had no apples in it and was probably 95% hollow) and the Pastel de Chocolate Abuelita (flourless chocolate cake) and the Crepas con Cajeta (crepes with plantains) and the Capirotada (bread pudding,) basically everything.

We definitely want to return, especially since my beau loves margaritas and drinks them weekly. Our server was great and we had a very pleasant experience. =)"

I lived in NYC for 9 yrs and never paid that much for Sangaria! The waiter brought a female manager over who was less then polite and basically told us they use 17 different high end alcohols and fresh fruit...and that there was nothing she could do bc it clearly states in the menu how much it is. If the food was fabulous it might have made the situation a little less aggravating, but even that was mediocre at best!

It is definitely classy for a Mexican restaurant - this is not your usual hole in the wall. The decor is very modern, and overall just has a very nice feel to it.

You never know what to expect in this area as far as wait times go, but luckily when I went here on a Tuesday night, there was no wait at all! I was seated right away and was given water and chips/salsa. Their salsa is very good - roasted peppers and tomatoes. Yum!

I was disappointed with how pricey their drinks were. The margarita was great, but tiny for $11! Most of the drinks are $9-$11. I thought that was too much for what you get. When I get a margarita, I like them big.

The food was very good. The portions are big, so I felt like it was worth the money. I got the fajitas, and that was probably enough for 2 people. They have a nice selection (pretty much your typical Mexican fare).

The service was very good - our waitress always had our drinks filled, asked if everything was going ok, food came out in a timely fashion, and she boxed up my food for me. No complaints there!

Honestly if their drinks weren&#39;t so pricey (of if you got more for your money), this would be a 5 star place for me."

I have never been mistreated by a food service employee.  The blonde older hostess is terribly RUDE.  I am convinced she is racist.  She had the audacity to yell at us when we were upset that a 20 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait.  SHE SHOULD GET FIRED IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!!!

I suggest going to Mago or Javiers.  The food is great, the drinks are amazing &amp; the prices are cheaper.  The service is 10x better at those restaurants.

My friends and family will no longer be going to Salsa 17 due to our terrible experience which is very unfortunate because my family would go there at least once a month."

In the heart of scenic downtown Arlington Heights, which is home to several amazing restaurants, if you&#39;re in the mood for Mexican, look nowhere else.  I first came here with three of my friends after we had visited Arlington Park Race Course a few years ago.  I live in the city so it&#39;s difficult for me to get out to the suburbs, but since my parents live in Buffalo Grove nearby, it was convenient for us this past Sunday.  From my first visit, I remembered the ambiance, the food, and the drinks, and it just left a positive memory in my head.

So, I took my parents there this time.  And let me tell you, it lived up to ALL the memories and expectations I had.  The convenient parking, the beautiful fountain outside, and the awesome summer day made entering this place even more alluring.  A very friendly host greeted us and seated us right away, as we walked into a restaurant that was elegantly and artistically designed to resemble the spirit of Mexico.  From the color scheme to the sombreros to the approachable waiters with the cool &#34;Arriba...&#34; shirts, it felt like I never need to go to Mexico again because I can just go to Salsa 17.  They had nice music playing as well, that wasn&#39;t too overpowering.  I definitely heard a Romeo Santos jam. :)

Finally, the food.  Amazingness!  It doesn&#39;t matter if your&#39;e vegetarian or not, a drinker or not, because they have EVERYTHING.  We ordered the tableside guacamole, extra spicy, the spinach quesadillas, which were the best quesadillas I have ever eaten in my life, and the vegetarian tostadas, also delicious.  The limonadas were tasty too, and our waitress Marsella was super cool.  The bill was also very reasonable.  I didn&#39;t want to leave that place.  I will definitely go back.

This is the best Mexican restaurant in the Northwest Chicagoland area.  No joke."

There was nothing bad about this place - there was just nothing outstanding about it either. I will say that we ordered a meal and we are real gringos so we don&#39;t like really spicy food. Trust me, I know - I get it, I&#39;m going to a Mexican restaurant and there is going to be a lot of that type of food BUT we have been to plenty of Mexican restaurants and had great non-spicy meals.

The margaritas are very good and definitely on the &#34;citrusy&#34; side.  I especially enjoy their version of salsa - it looks like it is prepared with a mole&#39; base.
I had the fish enchiladas which are prepared with scallops and shrimp and a red sauce and cheese are drizzled over them.  It was very good.  My dining partner had the spinach and cheese quesadillas.  She let me try one and I thought it was OK but didn&#39;t have much spice.
All in all this was a decent lunch."

Not real busy anymore which should have been a sign. We&#39;d been here once since the change and it was ok, but not great. So we thought we&#39;d give it another shot.
We waited for over half hour for our entree, the &#34;surf and turf&#34; special which was suggested as an upgrade to the regular mixed fajitas. The steak was well done instead of requested medium rare and quite dry. The beans and rice were just so-so and barely warm. They cooked us another steak, but we had to wait another 20 minutes and while cooked to the right temp it was tough and not a great cut of beef. Should have insisted on the regular fajitas. 
The wait staff was pleasant and apologetic, but there are better choices out there. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back."

They seated parties without reservations in front of us which I was confused as to why they bother taking reservations. Anyway they do have a nice bar and bellied on up for some TASTEE top shelf margaritas. Defiantly checkum out. The setting is fun and well decorated. I do have to say the music was crazy loud and not very authentic to what I would imagine. During dining hours might want to rethink the club vibe and volume of the music. Now to the food. Guacamole made at the table was tastee, although I specifically asked for it to be spicy unfortunately it was not... but still worthy of devouring. The salads are BIG And glad we split it. The entrees are also GIANORMOUS but I have to say again were very bland. The service was adequate with a few flaws both nothing horrible. Overall a good spot but could use some fine tuning."

This place has good salsas, as per the name, great beverages and wonderful moles, but the entrees are just okay.  Pretty good shrimp.  Bland chicken tamale, but nothing really wrong with it.  

When we want mexican food, we go to Wheeling...or any El Famous.  And we use paper napkins, plastic forks and save a bundle.  Better food, less atmosphere.  Great trade off."

However what was supposed to be a relaxing dinner with my boyfriend turned into the dinner from hell. The table next to us was seated after us yet was leaving by the time we FINALLY got our food. 


Two tables down a couple that sat down significantly after us also left by the time we finished our dinner and were waiting  some more to ask for the check. At least when we finally got the check I asked the manager for the discount and she took an app and drink off the bill. 


Needless to say I will DEFINITELY never come back and suggest you don&#39;t either (but if you do definitely try to avoid Miguel, the server). My suggestion is Mago&#39;s or Javier&#39;s instead!!!"

Tastiest and most authentic Moles. Wonderful selection of wines (try Navarro Malbec red wine with any beef dish). Generous size portions and many options which are naturally gluten free.

If you are gluten free, their secret to tasty fajitas is a splash of soy sauce. I know it sounds unconventional but it&#39;s undetectable that is what&#39;s in there but can hurt a celiac.

I&#39;ve had great experience with food here 9/10 times and the one time it wasn&#39;t great it was still good.

The staff are sweet, warm and helpful and really represent the best of the culture of Mexico."

The cons.  They got my order mixed up.  They didn&#39;t tell us that the fried ice cream portions were so huge, otherwise we would&#39;ve shared."

Although it certainly is an authentically Mexican restaurant, for the most part, there are tiny little details in their menu that make it very obvious most of their customers aren&#39;t Mexicans. 

Nonetheless, this place was nothing short of amazing!

We decided to have my Daddy&#39;s birthday dinner here since he&#39;s your typical Mexican; he refuses to eat anything other than Mexican food. We arrived on a Saturday at around 6 PM. And although finding parking was a bit of a hassle, we got lucky and found a good spot. 
When we walked in, the hostess told us it would be about a 25-30 minute wait. It was nice out so we decided to wait outside since she asked for our number and said she would just call when our table was ready. I assume they do this since they really have no space for people to wait inside the restaurant. And since it&#39;s located in the heart of the town, there are lots of shops within walking distance. 

To my surprise, they had a copy of their menu on the wall just outside the door. I loved this because it makes the ordering process so much faster! We only ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes. Our server was a fellow Mexican, and was very nice and helpful. Our drinks, although were a little on the &#34;too sweet&#34; side, were delicious. We decided we must try their famous table-side guac. However, by the time the lady was able to get through the crowds and packed tables, make our guac, and serve it, our food was already being served as well.

I definitely can&#39;t complain, the food came out super fast! I certainly wasn&#39;t expecting that since they were so busy. We for sure thought there was no way any of us would finish our entrees since we devoured the chips with the guac and both of the delicious salsa&#39;s the serve beforehand. But everything was so delicious. For once, there were NO leftovers.

Once the food arrived, I loved that it was literally still sizzling from the stove! Since it was just my family, I got a chance to try a piece of all of our plates. Seriously, OMG. These guys don&#39;t joke around. 

I ordered the chicken stuffed with cheese and peppers. They pour some type of mushroom sauce over it, and serve it with their famous chipotle mashed potatoes. I think my favorite part of all was the mushroom sauce. I can&#39;t even try to describe it. It was so perfect! Another thing that wowed me was the quality of the chicken. It wasn&#39;t too dry, and cooked to perfection! I&#39;m a cheese lover, so having it stuffed with loads of cheese was perfect. Oh and we can&#39;t forget those amazing mashed potatoes! The perfect amount of spicy-ness!

I also had a chance to try their Carne Asada, and I can&#39;t deny I was so impressed! The quality of their meat is insane! And it was literally cooked to perfection! My brother and sister both got different kinds of shrimp entrees. One was some type of garlic saute, and the other was with chipotle sauce. They both came with the chipotle mashed potatoes. I can&#39;t say that I prefer one over the other, they were both delicious, and I loved that their shrimp were so big. 

The fajitas was probably the only entree that didn&#39;t have that &#34;wow&#34; factor. But of course, the quality was still consistent with everything else. 

As far as price, for a Mexican restaurant, it is certainly a little on the high end. Although, considering it&#39;s location, it&#39;s probably spot on. However, I&#39;ve been to many overpriced Mexican restaurants, and this, by far, is worth every penny!

Hence my super long review."

We are vegetarians and their options are spectacular.  The Chile Rellenos ... they make my head spin they&#39;re so good.  The black bean tamales with goat cheese are spectacular as well.  This is a next-level Mexican food location - not your typical Mexican-American food.  Think Fontera Grill downtown.  The table guacamole service and salsas are a step above almost every other Mexican restaurant I&#39;ve visited too.  My only criticism would be that the food is on the salty-side, but that&#39;s an unfortunately pervasive state of things at upscale restaurants these days (thanks Gordon Ramsay)

The drinks, though expensive, and staff are top notch.  They have homemade sangria onsite but I&#39;m a sucker for the margaritas.  The mezcal based one is my favorite.  This is one of our hands-down favorite restaurants and where I bring my lady on many of our most special evenings.

Usually can&#39;t get out of here for under $100, but we do leave feeling warm, very well fed, appreciated and with lots of leftovers"

The chips were warm and the salsa smoky and had a good amount of heat, which I liked. I got the shrimp tostadas - too spicy and too many onions for me. My wife got the enchiladas with salsa verde. The chicken in the enchiladas was super moist and tender. Rice and beans were fairly standard. Got the apple crepes for dessert. Really good dessert - I&#39;m not big on sweets but I enjoyed it.

Please note, yelp reviewers and Yelp&#39;s employees, that I will continue to post this review until it is no longer being deleted. I have every right to account for my experience.

Below is my original review:

We had an amazing experience dining here. Our serve Antonio was not only well veresed on every dish on the menu, but was courteous and articulate throughout the evening. We ordered two dishes and the chicken we tried was mouthwatering and so savoury. I couldn&#39;t get enough of the many flavors in the dish, I wish I remembered the name of it. The place is beautiful and the atmosphere at night is lively and youthful. We were going to pass on dessert, but Antonio was so descriptive in explaining the ingredients in the fried ice cream that we had to give it a try. Wow. Incredible! We are going to come here again and again, and definitely will request the fine dining experience we received with Antonio. If you haven&#39;t been here, I would recommend trying their homemade guacamole, made fresh to order with chopped garlic. A+"

Mojitos are supposed to be a refreshing drink, but after finishing mine at Salsa 17, I felt as thirsty as a sponge in the middle of the Death Valley desert. I asked the bartender if they could please take it easy on the sugar --as in using half of what they had used, at the most-- and she proceeded to tell me the mojitos came from a pre-made mix. I could not believe my ears. Specially having to fork 10 a piece for each drink. I can only imagine all of their drinks are just some Walmart bought mix with some added ice. After seeing some of their dishes come out of the kitchen, I realized that the whole place is a lot of style with little substance. In the end, we decided to just get some tacos at an unassuming taco joint, even if that meant not rubbing elbows with the polo shirt and khaki shorts crowd."

We had the friendliest server (Ulises) who was fast and attentive. Food is amazing. You must get the table-side guac. Delicious, and it&#39;s fun to watch them make it in front of you. I had the chicken fajitas which came with beans, rice, guac, sour cream, cheese, pico de gallo, and of course the grilled veggies. Some of the best fajitas I&#39;ve ever had. My boyfriend had the enchiladas verdes and loved them. The ambiance is great and we loved sitting outside in the decorated alley- they did a great job converting that into an eating area. I had sangria blanco which was also delicious and came with fresh fruit (unlike some places that use canned, or just plain old nasty fruit). Highly recommend, great for a date night. Reasonable prices as well.

The manager (I&#39;m assuming she was the manager) came around to our table and made sure everything was okay during our meal. She was very much a people person and had a very professional demeanor, so brownie points for that (she was the manager with the owl tattoo)."

So we were out celebrating Friday evening before going to the movie theater across the street and we had a good hour and a half before the movie started , and I suggested we try De Marcos.

I used to go there at least 20 years ago and I have to say that this place has not changed one bit. back then there was no &#34; yelping&#34; but here we are in 2016 and I have to say..... This place is really good. 

Yes its hidden on the very corner in the small little strip of businesses, yes parking can be a challenge, and yes with a blink of an eye you&#39;d pass it up if you don&#39;t know its there or if you&#39;re going for the 1st time and get turned around trying to navigate the area.but its right on the corner of 53 and Lake street/

So everything in the area was packed, considering it was Friday evening , the week before Thanksgiving and it seemed like everyone was out, But we parked, walked in, and were seated instantly.

Our Waitress, Mary, was at our table within one minute and took our drink order - 1 French Martini and 1 glass of Pinot Noir- made very good and wine tasted fabulous!!

Bread basket with small pizza tomato bread cut into squares- The tomato sauce is a hit!! was placed on the table and we enjoyed that before putting in our order and that alone would&#39;ve been enough with drinks.

 So we ordered The Portabello mushroom appetizer which was prepared with some garlic and balsamic served warm and that was like wow---- as they say in Campbell soup labels-- mmmmm good!! a must rry.

On to dinner: we ordered the Lasagna and chicken breasts in a wine sauce served with potatoes and Italian sausages and I have to say that  I was very pleased at how moist and flavorful the chicken was . ordered a side of angel hair pasta which tasted like it was home made and served with the &#34;red sauce&#34; again -- mmmmm gooood!! that sauce alone is really good! The lasagna was as good as any, not to over powering with any ingredient but just right..

De Marcos was good back then and its definitely just as good today !! I would highly recommend it when ever you&#39;re out  and would like to do dinner before a movie or want to have dinner with  you spouse/ or gf /bf or have a family gathering. It&#39;s as authentic as good &#39;ol Nanas&#34;  home cooking. 

The dining area is very comfy, the bar is a good size to have a few or while you wait when its busy and is not cheap on the liquor, you want a drink? well you&#39;ll get your moneys worth thats for sure, and the staff is very attentive  fast, no waiting here!.

cant talk about it any more to give you an idea of what its like , so you should check it out, you wont be disappointed !!"

The outside is completely unassuming - dare I say, boring - and there are plenty of Italian restaurants in our rotation, so I wouldn&#39;t have even bothered to venture to a new one if our friends hadn&#39;t asked us to dine with them there a few weeks ago.

And we would have been forever missing out.

This is one of those weird reviews where the decor, the ambiance, the price, none of that really mattered. Because the food. Is so. Good. So good.

The interior is fine. The lack of a wait on a Friday at 7 was phenomenal. Our server was perfectly charming (and described every menu item in such rich detail that I wanted it all!). We began with an appetizer special - fresh buffalo mozzarella with thick, fresh tomato slices, shredded basil, kalamata olives, and good olive oil. It was the perfect caprese salad, I could have eaten six more portions of that incredible mozz. For the main, I went with the gnocchi pasta, with sage and butter sauce, and sausage. It sounds so simple, but sometimes simple is easiest to screw up. This was incredible. The gnocchi was fresh, the portion was ample, and the texture was al dente, almost chewy, perfection.  The sage was fresh and flavorful, the rich butter sauce was decadent, and the sausage was savory and plentiful. It was so easy but so sophisticated. Comforting but elegant. It&#39;s tough to describe how well curated this plate of pasta was, but it was delicious.

If you&#39;re looking for authentic, rich, comforting, fantastic food in a quiet and simple atmosphere, take a chance on those anonymous looking, easy to pass up little corner restaurant. You will not be disappointed."

They had a variety of daily specials. We had a chicken in a Brandy sauce. It was very very good. It came with a side of pasta with red sauce it was good. Table bread was a nice treat. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. 

While we were there there was a small party in the backroom and a few tables of other folks. It wasn&#39;t packed around 1 PM which was nice we had a chance to sit and talk and didn&#39;t feel rushed. 

Some misc things. The parking is a bit of a pain but workable. It appear the crew is allowed to eat together after the lunch crowd which was very nice to see. They kept one server at the door to watch for new guests (very nice that they do that -congrats to the owners). They did serve Diet Coke in bottles vs. fountain.

The menu is not particularly lengthy but there were 6 specials the night we dined.  We both ordered pasta dishes off the regular menu and they were fine.  We started with  a half dozen baked clams that were the typical quarter to half dollar sized clams that restaurants typically serve these days.  Yes, they were good but very small.  At close to $9, skip them they are not worth the price.  (If you want really good, plentiful baked clams, check out my other reviews.)

I had my usual Bolognese pasta that  I always order when dining at a new Italian restaurant.  Yes, it was very good.  (If I hadn&#39;t been spoiled by an incredible Bolognese I had in Door Cty, the one at De Marco&#39;s would have rated excellent.)  My wife had a shrimp, scallops and vegetables with garlic &amp; oil.  She really enjoyed it.

We started with the excellent cream of mushroom soup.  This was definitely the highlight of the meal.

Drinks are fairly priced.  You&#39;ll find wines by the glass for $7.  My vodka on the rocks was $8.  My wife said the Cosmopolitan was excellent.  Our server, Drew, was friendly while being efficient.

A 3-star review should not be construed as &#34;average&#34;.  It was &#34;A-OK&#34;.  Drinks and service were excellent and the food was good.  Prices for pasta dishes are a little high.  This impacts my price/value ratio and why I rate them 3-stars.  There is a LOT of competition for Italian retaurants.  De Marco&#39;s offers a good solid meal but so do many others."

The food was always exceptional.  Favorites:  Chicken marsala, seared tuna, their tiramisu is the BEST and their white chocolate cheesecake...omg!   BUT...

When the economy turned Jerry (the owner) and some of the staff were oblivious.  The prices, which were already up there, continued to climb even as the restaurant emptied.  Some of the staff started playing games with the bills to see how much they could inflate a check.  Asked for the house wine?  Surprise!  I gave you the premium.  Asked for a simple mix of pasta, spinach and ricotta? Surprise!  I&#39;m going to see if you&#39;ll pay $27 for it.  Suddenly MY restaurant couldn&#39;t be trusted  and I started noticing more and more how empty it was...  How tired everyone seemed...  How Jerry or his wife would sit at a table like it was their living room rather than a public dining room.  That&#39;s not fun.  That&#39;s not energetic.

We started going less and less and after one too many bill &#34;mistakes&#34; my husband instituted a boycott.  I continued to occasionally go on the sly.  But you know how it is once you&#39;ve been a regular...  If it becomes obvious you&#39;ve found somewhere else to go there is resentment when you return.  I&#39;d start being offered bad tables in an empty dining room.  Service would be slow, again, in an empty dining room.  The last time I went...and it WAS my last time ever...I received full-on hostile service.  It was shocking.  

I have no doubt the food is still quite good but every time I drive by, even during prime dining hours on a Friday or Saturday night, the place looks nearly empty.  I saw another reviewer mention getting in on a weekend and picking her own table without a reservation as if this was a good thing!  It&#39;s not.  It shows a formerly great restaurant in a death spiral.

A better choice would be Za Za&#39;s just down the road."

This could be quite the romantic spot for a couple, absolutely.

The tri-colored lobster ravioli with shrimp in a light cream sauce was the boss!  Every bite both caused my taste buds to rejoice yet made me a little sadder because it meant that the end of the meal was closer. (ok - my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.)

The house salad was nothing special, but no complaints about it...the job of a salad is to prep you for the main course, unless you actually are in Italy, but that&#39;s another issue.  Fresh pepper made optional by the server is always a nice touch.

Very nice waitstaff, and the insides of the place was fine.  The strip mall that the place is in is disappointing, so don&#39;t shy away because of that.

I would have given 5 stars, but $2.75 for a 7.5 oz bottle of coke?   Seriously???"

Oh-and it smelled like cigars.Once seated were were so close to the men next to us that we might as well been sitting with them. We heard ever single word of their conversation.When it came time to order, I was disappointed the waitress told me that they were OUT of mussels to complete my seafood diavolo. Okay, is it so impossible to go to the store and buy more? Ergo, I asked to substitute  for more calamari instead. My fiance ordered GRILLED calamari as an appetizer and that is EXACTLY what it tasted like. The grill dominated the flavor. It might as well been thrown straight onto the coals. I suppose they have yet to master how to cook calamari this way. If this is what it IS suppose to taste like then....yuck!

Anyhow, when my entree arrived I was excited until I realized it was the 80% pasta 20% SEAFOOD rip of meal.I also requested it be spicy and ended up dousing it in Tabasco sauce, Needless to say, The linguine went home and my fiance ate it for lunch the next day. 

Cons

-Shaker Parmesan cheese? Really?

-Tables to close

-smelled like cigars at entrance

-overpriced pasta I could make at home. 

-out of food required for meal 

Pros

They had actual Tabasco sauce. 

-the waitress was nice.

-The  complimentary fruit dish at at the end was fresh. But why did the two guys 
next to us get waaay more watermelon then we did? /:I

This place is located in a small strip mall on Lake and Rohlwing. 

I have to say that each and every time here, I have never had a meal that was below excellent. The food here is just delicious. I most always get pasta but I have had their specials too. Every time delicious. 
The bread with their house garlic butter would alone satisfy me but I know that there are lots and lots of good things to eat. The Linguine Del Gulfo (I think I spelled it right) is pretty incredible. All sorts of seafood on a perfect pasta and sauce. White clam linguine is some of the best you will have.
This last visit, my wife had the spinach ravioli special which was just something else. The spinach was the pasta with a fluffy cheese stuffing in a delicious sauce that had some sage in it .I like going with her because she always lets me  try her food. ;)
I also like that they provide some complimentary fruit at the end of dinner.

So maybe you ask why am I only giving four stars instead of five? The prices. They are up there. They are dollars more than I believe they should be but I still go there anyway because it is so good. Their pour on the wine could be larger too, but so what? I get two glasses.

I am glad I live fairly close by.

Hands down, this is the best place for Italian food in the western suburbs. Really.

Cheers to All"

The restaurant part is nothing to write home about, the music is played from overhead speakers, some of them directly over tables. Instead of non-descript music, the local radio is played, including the annoying ads in between.

It seemed to be all a bit rushed - the waiting staff, how your food was served, etc.

We had the grilled tuna, cheese ravioli and grilled calamari. No risotto on the menu, unfortunately.

Calamari was grilled ok, nothing special, the tuna seemed overpriced for the quality / thickness, the cheese ravioli is, well, cheese ravioli.

All in all, a dinner with taxes for about $57 - overpriced."

I have always wanted to try this restaurant when I was passing by Lake/53. However every time I was on my way to somewhere else and not able to make a stop for a meal.  Well 2 weeks ago we tried.

This is going to be your best review yet!  I remember my first time coming here was in HS. I had some delicious pasta and fresh bread.  Don&#39;t be deceived by a restaurant in a plaza.  This one would easily top most restaurants in Little Italy.

I know somebody who was in the hospital, and the first meal they wanted was Demarcos.  

The grilled seafood with angel hair pasta is delicious.  Comes with butterflied shrimp, fish, and octopus.  I had the salmon.  Let me say the only other salmon I enjoyed at a restaurant in Chicago was at Blackbird. It was so juicy and flavorful.  The greens on the side with garlic was a nice compliment.

I would like to say that the server Debbie is wonderful!

It was a decent sized seating area and they seated us and every party eating there away enough from each other that we could not hear our conversations.

luckily we called ahead and got a table within 30 minutes, we got fried calamari and baked clams for appetizers 
calamari was okay, not the best ive had, didnt try the clams but the others said it was tasty.
I had the chicken marsala, entree comes with soup or salad. soup really filled me up, i barely ate my marsala, which was tasty also. My boyfriend went for the chicken parmesan, yummmyyy, it was really good, and it was a large portion 
for dessert we got tiramisu, not the best i&#39;ve had, but it was still good.

We came here at dinnertime and were seated very promptly.  The restaurant itself is relatively small but they had outdoor seating as well.  Some older gentlemen were having drinks and smoking cigars outside.   Once we sat down, we were served the standard bread, olive oil, and vinegar expected at an Italian restaurant.  They also had a pizza bread that was pretty good too.  There was an extensive wine menu, but we did not order anything to drink.  

The daily specials seemed to be the way to go here and were highlighted by the waitress.  They had 7-8 specials for the day in review.  I ordered a tilapia and S ordered the Calamari Risotto Diablo.  When the tilapia came out, I couldn&#39;t believe the size of it and it came with a side of pasta!  The tilapia was done right: flaky and light, pan fried to perfection.  It was smothered in a tomato based sauce and olives and tomatoes sprinkled over it.  I didn&#39;t think I would eat the whole thing but I managed to make it through (thank god for my appetite).  I didn&#39;t have the room to finish the al dente pasta that came with the meal.  My friend S&#39;s dish was good too.  The risotto was wonderfully creamy and they weren&#39;t kidding about the diablo; the dish was spicy as well!  He couldn&#39;t finish the dish either, so we both ended up packing up lunch for the following day.  

The service was wonderful here.  As quickly we were seated was as quick as everything else.  My glass of water was never less than three-fourths full and I never had to look around to find the waitress.  They gave us fruit for dessert which was perfect after a large meal, even though we said we did not want dessert.  I would recommend this place as a wonderful date spot and also for larger eaters.  I am definitely coming back here."

Upon the reviews we found on yelp and other guides, we ordered right off of the specials menu. $18 for a grilled octopus appetizer that was charred nicely, but not blanched in cold water afterwards; thus incredibly rubbery and chewy. My wife ordered the lobster linguine - $28 and me the tilapia special with spinach for $25. My tilapia was delicious, although the portion was tiny given only 1 side. My wife&#39;s meal was average at best, although the portion was much better. After a glass of wine for the wife (water for me), and a piece of tiramisu we had a $115 bill after 17% tip (mind you the bus staff does ALL the work and the wait staff took it easy). $115 is a mag mile price for dinner - not a strip mall location in a western Chicago suburb.

If people are looking to arrive at a restaurant on a Fri/Sat night without waiting for at least 20-30 minutes you are apparently new to earth. The food at DeMarcos is amazing and it will hands down beat any Italian restaurant (chain) that you will go to. It is pricey but if you are looking for authentic Italian food in a  warm and romantic place I def suggest DeMarcos. The dining area is smaller but I didn&#39;t have an issue with noise or anything.

I had the three taco special, which was three tacos with rice and beans. For the meat I chose Al Pastor (pork), and it was topped with onions and cilantro, which is the authentic way. The meat was marinated nicely, and piled on street style corn tortillas. The beans were basic refried beans that were topped with cheese. The rice was the only thing that seemed to lack flavor. It was good, but I&#39;ve had better. 

My boyfriend had the burrito pequino with rice and beans. He chose chicken for his meat, and he said it was good. Overall, service was quick, and the food was good.

However, this is based off my recent trip, yesterday. As its been months since I have been here, but I was disappointed to where I won&#39;t be returning again.

I had the 3 taco dinner (steak, tripas, and chicarrones) the sides of bean &amp; rice lacked flavor and was super bland, where it tasted like it was from a can or a box. 

The steak taco was dry, the tripas were decent, and the chicarones were not how I remembered them to be.

To be honest, we did eat a majority of it because we have been drinking, but usually I&#39;m not picky and just realized knowing if I was pretty sober eating that, I would&#39;ve most likely left everything on the plate. 

My friend had some spicy shrimp dish, which also lacked flavor and her husband got the shrimp cocktail, which only came with maybe 5 pieces of shrimp in there as it was all mainly the tomato juice. 

Too bad, this was our go to spot whenever in the area. We will now be looking elsewhere for tacos."

The tortas are decent but the meat had too much chewy pieces and fat. tacos are decent. Wet burrito is pretty good.

Well when it comes to Mexican food, I&#39;m guessing the locals eat at Original Tacos.  The prices are reasonable, the food is tasty and English is NOT the primary language spoken by the wait staff. :-)  I had heard about this place from a friend of mine when we were telling them about Taco el Norte and raving about how authentic is was.  My friend mentioned that this place was good and I figured I&#39;d give it a try.  The guacamole was good, the salsa was spicy (but not too much) and my ground beef macho burrito was more than I could finish. (Maybe because i also got a side of rice and beans.)  The co-worker I came with also got the macho burrito, but his had shredded beef and he said he&#39;d make a point to go out of his way to eat at this place again.

My wife had the fish taco dinner and my daughter had the chicken taco dinner.

I liked that you can see what is being cooked, and all of the aromas coming from behind the counter smelled amazing! The restaurant itself is tiny, I think I counted 8 tables, and it was very clean. They have a decent size menu, a lot to choose from and they sell beer! 
My order was done and ready to go in about 6 minutes. I was very impressed with the size of my meal but the food didnt wow me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoyed and liked my meal but I wish I would have ordered the tacos. I got a cheese, a steak and a chicken enchilada. The meat tasted delicious, full of flavor and just right but I wasn&#39;t impressed with the sauce. There was nothing special about it. The rice was ok but I didn&#39;t like the beans at all. Im a beans girl and these beans were not good, very bland. So I give this place 4 stars because I loved the flavor of the steak and chicken and I know the tacos would be delish and their horchata was great. I will for sure go back for the tacos!"

It was my first time trying out the tacos here. And it wasn&#39;t all that great.

I ordered 3 chicken tacos and 3 fish tacos for pick up. They gave me about 5-10 minutes so it was pretty quick in terms of cooking. 

Each taco comes with lettuce, onion, cilantro upon your request. It&#39;s about the size of your hand as for the portion. 

Chicken taco was quite disappointing to say the least. Chicken was very dry and overcooked as it became harder to eat without pouring a load of salsa that came with the order. 

Fish taco was better however. It was a fried cod filet that also appeared to be overcooked. It had a dark brown coating which showed sign of being left in the fryer for too long. 

I paid about 13 dollars for 6 tacos, but I felt like I didn&#39;t get what I paid for in terms of quality. Good thing I was at least hungry.

This review is solely on the tacos so I can&#39;t say much about other things on the menu. 

If you&#39;re looking for good quality tacos, I&#39;d suggest you find somewhere else."

I ordered there once and that was enough to completely and utterly turn me off from this place forever. I ordered steak nachos and steak tacos, a standard order for me when trying out a new Mexican joint. I was so disappointed when I opened the container filled with oddly chopped tomatoes and onions and a sprinkle of meat. I gagged at first bite and nearly choked to death because the meat was so damn dry. I immediately regretted the decision to skip the horchata. I wish I could describe how bland the meat tasted but I can&#39;t describe a flavor that wasn&#39;t there... THERE WAS NO FLAVOR, which frightened me...
The tacos had all the fixings that should have made them bomb and a hit right off the bat, but of course life couldn&#39;t be so rewarding, I nearly choked again. Trying my hardest I swallowed and tried to find the flavor...again it was missing...
I hate the waste of time and money and I wouldn&#39;t wish this devastatingly disappointing restaurant on my worst enemy...not even a LAPD cop...

You&#39;d be better off going to taco bell around the corner... You&#39;re welcome for the advice.

I had something interesting...  A Hawaiian Burrito.  BBQ Sauce, Steak (or Chicken), pineapple, refried beans, rice, lettuce, and perhaps a few other odds and ends.   It was nice sized, and certainly a unique taste.   Encouraging enough to try them again, but likely not for another Hawaiian burrito.  It&#39;s ok, and worth trying once, but just didn&#39;t grab my attention for a long term favorite food relationship.

Food: I ordered the regular cheeseburger with a small fry and drink. The prices were kind of iffy, but worth it in the end. The cheeseburger has two meat patties on it and tastes absolutely delicious. The cheese is also melted wonderfully on the top of the patties. The French fries, unlike what everyone seems to be saying, are not greasy at all. 

In conclusion, I had a wonderful time at the establishment and will be going back soon :D"

I have tried this location a couple times, and a few other locations.  I never really enjoyed my meals from here.  It&#39;s sad that I can make better burgers at home than basically any restaurant has served me.  If you want super greasy fries and a big but low quality burger, then sure, give them a try.  Not for me.  Only places that I have found I enjoy burgers at are expensive sit down restaurants (and I&#39;m not talking about like TGI Fridays; I mean like expensive steakhouses likes Wildfire or Chicago Q - and you should probably get ribs or a steak from these places), or small town bars where they make their burgers by hand in house.

I don&#39;t recall where the other was but the experiences were similar. Five Guys is not anything glamorous. This makes it quaint. The seats are not too comfortable, but they seem to be clean.

They serve burgers, hot dogs and fries. They also have a couple of sandwiches. They give you a number of options on the burgers - notably missing is fried egg, which seems to be very big at other burger joints lately. But, I had a burger with everything. The meat was very fresh, and I was surprised by the amount of meat. There were two good sized patties - I would get somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 pound of meat. The veggies were okay - the tomatoes were kind of tasteless, but the jalapenos were crisp and spicy.

Everyone raves about the fries and I&#39;m not sure why. I get the fact that they buy from specific farmers - they make that very clear. When we went there was a sign that shows what town in Idaho they were grown in, and the name of the farmer. And, while the potato taste was good, the fries were kind of soggy. I really like mine crisp but that may be a personal preference.

They have one of those coca-cola drink machines where you can mix your own and have multiple choices. I have been trying to stay away from sodas of any kind (mostly successfully) so I had an Iced tea. They had another machine where you can choose your iced tea - iced black tea, iced green tea, iced sweet tea, and there was one other choice I don&#39;t recall. The black tea I chose was not very good. It tasted like it was powdered, but in fairness I don&#39;t think it was. I just expected something that tasted fresh. Oh, and they do have freshly sliced lemon, but the ones they had appeared to have been sitting out for a while and were browning.

I would say that it is certainly worth going back for a burger, but I would skip the fries and the iced tea."

So many people have told me that 5 Guys is the best fast food chain out there so I knew I had to finally try it. 

Burgerwise - Five Guys is pretty dang good. I went for the bunless option (any burger can be made into a salad or wrapped in lettuce) but I also took a bite of my husband&#39;s burger that had a bun. I like that you can pick whatever toppings you want, so you can go as traditional or wild as you want. Both ways that I tried it, I would say the burger was a 4.5 star. The meat was extremely flavorful, juicy and fresh. It was the only fast food burger that I&#39;ve loved as much as In-n-Out. The fries were hand cut and just as good as the burger. This place isn&#39;t cheap though. For two burgers and a fry to split, it cost $20. 

The reason for not giving higher stars overall is because I thought the staff was less than accommodating here. I tried to ask a few questions since I was a newbie and I was met with a bit of an attitude and 0 helpfulness."

From all the gourmet burger places I place it above meatheads but not quite better than smashburger but not by much.  Where Smashburger is more airy as far as burgers go, this place is more meat and thick.  Their menu should give it away, their standard burgers are double burgers so if you want a single go for the single.  You build your own burger here so make it to your tasting.  They make everything to order and their portion in fries are HUGE!  A large fry is usually good for two.

They have an outside area for when the weather is actually nice in Chicago!  And I can&#39;t go without saying they have one of those lovely Coke machines!  Love it!"

The burgers are hand-formed and never frozen; there is not a single freezer in the store. Not counting cheese they can come with your choice of over a dozen toppings with either one or two 3.2 ounce patties. Due to popular request there are also 3 sizes of fry servings and even the smallest size can feed two people. Most 5G stores such as this one also offer a Coke Freestyle machine that allows you to mix popular Coca Cola products with flavor add-ons for over 100 drink combinations. You cannot go wrong here... 

unless you have a peanut allergy, since they use peanut oil and have free peanuts for consumption while you wait for your food.

The prices could be more reasonable, as well."

February 25, 2015 I placed an order to pick up.

HAMBURGER
1. Someone made the burger, wrapped it up and it appears once it was wrapped up they squished it into a ball.  When I took my hamburger out, it was round and I thought, hmmm - that&#39;s rather odd, but maybe it&#39;s that way because I ordered a lettuce as a bun.
2. I began to examine what I thought was a hamburger it appeared vomitous! Lettuce was severely saturated, soggy, extremely wilted, with a couple brown spots as a finishing touch. As I began to pull the lettuce off my round baseball looking item, the hamburger was all mashed up in little pieces, brown ground meat looking as if it was ready to put into a old fashioned Mock Cooter Soup! (RECIPE: From White Trash Cooking.  Author: Ernest Matthew Mickler). The tomato looked if someone took one slice of a tomato dropped it on their greasy floor and stomped on as if they were Barefoot Grape Stomping Champions. After digging into this hot mess (Actually it was cold... but you get the terminology I&#39;m trying to convey) with about ONE HALF cup of mayo. At that point, I wrapped it back up into the ball and tossed it in my garbage can and when it went in, I said, TWO POINTS for me.  You know, when you don&#39;t miss the garbage can?!

GRILLED CHEESE 
1. Very dense bread as if the bread was still in a dough texture. A TON of cheese, and I mean a TON.  I&#39;ve never seen so much cheese in a sandwich before.  If I scrapped the cheese out, I could make Con Queso Dip that would easily feed three to four grown adults. Lastly, I ordered the grilled cheese with tomato and sadly it was not in there and yes, I used my fork &amp; spoon to dig through the goop to see if it was smothered.  

FRENCH FRIES
1. The worst fries I have ever sank my teeth in my entire life.  SICK! Saturated with oil as if they were sitting for quite some time. When you grabbed a fry it immediately slouched over and the SMELL was just DIRTY.  That was some OLD reused oil that hasn&#39;t been changed in a long, long time. I would rather eat a dirty sock, the entire sock!  These fries could definitely be used on Fear Factor as a repulsive food challenge 

CALLED SCHAUMBURG / MEACHUM STORE
It was 5:55pm and a manager said, can you make this quick I leave at 6 (plus it was snowing like mad) although it irritated me, I spoke really fast - he said, come back into the store and I will have another manager give you a coupon (Mind you, It&#39;s snowing like Mad!) I said, no thank-you then hung up.  I called back at 6:10 to let to explain about my grilled cheese.  When I was done speaking, he was silent as if quietly hung up on me... He was there, then I said your food is absolutely disgusting and I&#39;ll never come back again.  He said, OK.  Then I said, I&#39;m going to post my review to Yelp and post my pictures, he said do what you want.  Then I hung up and now you are reading my horrible experience and at the same time, you get to view my photos!  Please take a look and enjoy the slide show.

NEVER - EVER would I recommend this establishment to anyone EVER nor will I ever eat or step foot inside a 5 Guy&#39;s restaurant.  No coupon can rectify my experience."

I can&#39;t pick my favorite fry though.  The cajun ones are addictive, but the five guys ones are wonderful as well.  Try them both, and share with the family to see which ones they like the most,

I&#39;ve had the hot dog which was just okay. The fries, also, are just okay but they give you so many! It fills up about half of a brown paper bags for the smaller size. I never dare have gotten the bigger size.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Finally there is a Schaumburg location for one of my favorite burger chains. For those in the area that have never been to Five Guys, the menu is pretty simple. They have &#34;burgers&#34; which are actually double patty, and they have &#34;little burgers&#34; which have the single patty.  They come plain, and you tell them what toppings you want from 16 items, like mayo, lettuce, grilled onions, A-1 sauce...etc.  

They also serve Hot Dogs, which I must say are absolutely delicious.  They split the dog in the middle and toss that sucker on the grill...mmm, mmmmmm, mighty tasty.  They have two types of fries, five guys style(regular) which I&#39;ve never had, and Cajun style (seasoned) which I recommend. 
The regular portion of fries is definitely enough for two people to share, but If your really love spuds then order the large.

I ordered my usual which is a bacon cheeseburger, with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and BBQ sauce.  Good for you, absolutely not! Does it taste good? Absolutely, positively YES!!!  They don&#39;t carry milkshakes, or salad, or onion rings...they got burgers, dogs, and fries. They stick to what they do best, and they are really good at it.  I have a feeling I will be here more often than my doctor would like me to be, but I&#39;m not complaining.  Welcome to Schaumburger!!!"

The burger meat is never frozen, always fresh and hand formed. The fries are peeled and cut in the store. Get the little cheeseburger with everything on it and your mouth will thank you for hours. Everything just blends together so well..I&#39;m starting to salivate a little just thinking about it.

Prices are kind of high, but I think it&#39;s worth it for this kind of burger quality. My only complaints include the bun getting soggy super fast (leading to a burger that&#39;s falling apart) and the bun sometimes cooling down by the time you eat it. No one likes cold buns.

Oh! They also have boxes and boxes of peanuts for you to scoop and eat while you wait. You probably want to avoid this place if you have a peanut allergy :p

Staff has always been super friendly and the bathroom and dining area are tidy and constantly being swept."

The menu is simple.  Burger, Bacon Burger, Fries, Hot Dog.  That&#39;s fine by me.  I come to this place for one thing really.  The burger.  I like the idea of being able to choose or customize your burger.  I had mine &#34;All the way&#34; meaning it included all the conventional toppings: lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, etc.  I did like that grilled onions and mushrooms were also an option.

Overall, a pretty good burger.  Like someone said, I can&#39;t picture myself coming here often.  Probably less than a month.  It&#39;s seriously unhealthy stuff and can put you into both a food coma and into a heart attack.  

It was on the pricey side which took a star from me.  I think I ended up paying around 25 bucks for 2 bacon burgers and a hot dog.  Really?  2 burgers and a hot dog with a side of fries for almost 30 bucks?  I&#39;m not even at a Bulls or Cubs game!  LOL."

The burgers are single or double burgers that are made fresh to order .  The topping list is pretty extensive and they don&#39;t overcharge for grilled shrooms, onions or peppers.

The fries are huge in portion, we split an order of small fries between four co-workers and it was more than plenty.  I&#39;m  alittle bummed we didn&#39;t realize there are cajun fries, but whatever.

Thanks for opening up so close to work and letting me try one of your fabled burgers before I move to the land down under.

Dip the fries in ketchup, and get a cherry coke from their drink area, and you&#39;ve got yourself a pretty good meal. You can add grilled onions to the burgers for no extra charge, but honestly, they aren&#39;t that great-- the whole no charge for toppings thing is cool though.

It seems like a lot of people have a problem with the price.  I think the price is fine, but to be honest I don&#39;t like to pay too low of a price when it involves meat.  I&#39;d rather pay a little more and have a decent quality of beef used."

As everyone says it&#39;s a little pricey but I don&#39;t care since it&#39;s an occasional artery clogging treat.

So we went again last night and the fries were absolutely disgusting.  I&#39;m not being dramatic at all, they were easily the worst I&#39;ve ever had in my life. They were so bad that we threw them out without eating any and didn&#39;t even give some to the dogs.  I almost took a picture of them flopped over the cup, it was so gross.  Completely soggy and they were mushier than I cook pasta, ick.

Am I missing something?  Aren&#39;t they known for having stellar fries??  So disappointing..."

However, I was not a fan of Five guys in Schaumburg for only one reason. Half their soda machine was out of order. I understand that shit happens and stuff breaks, but before people order drinks, you should let them know that selection of drinks is limited. I&#39;m very particular about the kind of soda i drink (regular sprite/sierramist/7up) and this was on the side that was broken. So I basically shelled out money for a large drink that I didn&#39;t even drink and the place wouldn&#39;t give me a refund. 

Oh and they claim their ingredients are fresh, but I asked for mushrooms on my burger and they tasted like they came out of a can. And my boyfriend said that the jalepenos were not that good."

My sister is a huge fan of Jaws Burgers near our house, and I&#39;ve heard that the two are pretty equal in taste. Honestly, I like Jaws a bit better. Five Guys has a good burger, but there&#39;s not a ton of flavor. And when I ate their fries, I could feel my arteries closing. Not that I didn&#39;t like them, but I didn&#39;t love them. And the fact that they&#39;re fried in peanut oil makes them the restaurant fries with the most calories. Yes, I looked...
I guess I prefer burgers with a bit more flavor and fries that are worth the calories I&#39;m consuming. Not that I&#39;ll never eat here again, but I guess I don&#39;t see what the big fuss over Five Guys is."

For $9.78 for a Little Cheeseburger, fries, and a regular drink, I think I&#39;d prefer to go down the street to Culver&#39;s.

The burger was definitely tasty, and I really liked the sesame bun. In fact, I Think that was the best part about it. The pickles have a bit of tang to them, and the beef was moderately seasoned, but fine. Everything seemed very fresh, and top notch for a fast food restaurant.

I expected more out of the fries, given how much effort they go to in order to let you know what others think about them (all over the walls, windows, drink). You can tell the potatoes were high quality, but they needed a bit more seasoning (Five Guys Style), and were perhaps just a touch undercooked. 

So solid food, but nothing I will crave, and about 20% too expensive IMO. I&#39;ll give it another shot after my arteries recover."

Honestly I have no idea why anyone would come here. The food was literally worse than the gristle burger they were serving down the street at Ted&#39;s Montana Grill (So shocking that Ted&#39;s closed this month). 

My boyfriends burger was really greasy. I ordered the veggie sandwich thinking it would be a nice healthy alternative. NOPE!!! It was a mess of greasy onions and I think green peppers fried until any nutritional value they might have had was gone. I could have eaten that &amp; caulked it up to experience (note to self - place is only for those on the fast track to a double bypass). They just had to drown that poor little sandwich in cheese, dripping, everywhere cheese. I like cheese, just not so much that It&#39;s a never ending mess that after 6 napkins of trying to wipe some of it off I give up &amp; toss the sandwich.

The burger was okay...but not original or great!!!  The beef patty only covered  1/2 of the bun while the salad of ingredients I chose filled the rest.  The fries were overly greasy.  The price was also highly inflated versus the quality &amp; quantity of the meal.  

Peanuts were available for patrons.  I don&#39;t really understand how a peanut goes with a greasy burger and fries...but they were available.

It was dry and as flavorless as a patty of meat could ever be. The fries were OK but I&#39;m not a huge fry person to begin with. The soda was the best part of my meal unfortunately.

I like the fact that you can get a regular fries and feed 2-3 people. And even though I didn&#39;t have any peanuts I like that idea of something while you wait for them to finish up cooking your burger.  The double cheeseburger was a good size but the flavor was not their for me.  I don&#39;t like a lot of toppings on my burgers but I like when they are seasoned with goodies like Woreschester.

Now with the price rant out of the way lets talk about the food....I wish it wasnt so good so I could tell myself that I will not be going back there, but I know I cant do that!!
The cajan fries were amazing, the fries still had the skin on them(my favorite) and they were super crispy. The little burger was a good size patty that was made fresh on the grill when you ordered, always nice to get fresh food. The best part of the while experience is the soda machine.....OMG you can make 100+ different flavors of sodas....it was so hard to chose so I had to make 2 different ones to try. First I made the coke zero with cherry syrup....VERY Good!! Then I made Mello Yello with grape syrup.....I would have never thought to try this on my own but it was really good.

Let me say In/Out for us was IN and this place 5 guys was OUT.

I went up to counter and no one was behind me. Started ordering and had a question about the toppings - the guy gave me this &#34;ok let me start this over again&#34; bussiness which was not very customer friendly. After I ordered 3 cheseburgers and 1 large fries - with cups for water, get the sticker shock of $24.xx dollars (the price was up there but just my mental calc when price comes - little voice went off). 

The ambience - the music was a little over the top. The place felt like sitting outside chilly, with the burger smell all over - expected, but over the top again. But I saw all the rave postings on the walls all across the joint, so was patient. 

The burger was greasy but bland even with the jalapeno - which was just a sliced green pieces. The veg was nothing to note. And to top it off the lady took the picture of the fries - old oil and talked to the cook - they agreed oil needed to change and laughed it off with the other helps which my daughter took note of. I was last to finish it trying to find something worthy to the posters I saw - even in the bathroom.  I&#39;m found myself metally driving back to other burger places.

-the patties themselves are somewhat overcooked for my taste and kind-of bland.
-the toppings selection is basically everything you&#39;d find at mcdonalds plus mushrooms, jalapenos and green peppers, I don&#39;t see why it is so prominent in their image
-the fries is the only redeeming point of this place. Be warned an order of small fries can feed 3 reg. people.

Also on a side note, I find it somewhat ironic that they put the origin of their potatoes prominently on the large sacks that double as a partition.  I would much rather know where the beef came from rather than the potatoes."

Their fries taste like potato skins, so you better like potato skins if you order them. Next time I&#39;ll try the cajun and a plain bacon cheeseburger (sounds sad). Their beef patty was tasteless - prefer Buona or Assembly even Burger King&#39;s flamed broiled taste. Got my order to go - the grease came through the bag, right away should have double bagged it.

Having cooked burgers for a fair amount of my life, I have my own opinion of what makes a burger good. One would think that Five Guys has what it takes, with the handmade burgers topped with fresh ingredients. But their burgers just do not live up to the hype that surrounds the name. Neither the single or double burgers seem to have any taste whatsoever other than the toppings. Not even the bun contributes anything to the burger. All of this results in an overpriced slab of blah. The peanuts are nice but merely a gimmick. Honorable mention goes to the fresh cut french fries which may be the best in the business. Too bad, though since I have little other reason to visit."

as for the food, their Cajun fries are sooo delicious.. i could tell that the potatoes were FRESH.. they just melted in my mouth.. my friends were having an orgasm in their mouth with their burgers.. i thought they were pretty good too but i honestly think the fries are better than the burgers.

I just reviewed Meatheads last week so for the sake of the war, I need to review Five Guys.  After visiting this location a couple times, the burger patties were a little inconsistent.  I had a regular cheeseburger which is usually a double patty but there was only half a patty on top, so considering the price I paid, I felt jipped!  Luckily the cajun fries were awesome so that partially made up for the lack of burger.  I&#39;ve learned to save some cash by splitting a small fries &amp; ordering water to drink, but I&#39;m still spending just under $10, which is out of control!  The service is what was really lacking this time around.  The past couple times I&#39;ve been here, it was busy &amp; the cooks were in the zone so the food was getting dished out at a fast pace.  But this visit was different, it was like the B shift was working.  Every part of the service was slow, from the cashier to the guy calling out the numbers.

I joked that they were trying to fatten you up because the sandwiches are served with soup, fries and coleslaw. Yes, that&#39;s an AND not an OR. I ended up ordering the mushroom and asparagus breakfast skillet which came with hash browns, two eggs and toast. There was something a little off about the taste of the asparagus. I couldn&#39;t quite place it. Everything else was fine and about what you&#39;d expect. Nothing fancy, just filling.

The food was decent but service was definitely lacking.  I wasn&#39;t expecting 5 star service since it is a diner but what we received was pretty terrible.

My friend and I came around 8pm on a Friday and it was pretty dead except for a couple tables.  I had the Fritta skillet with a side of potato pancakes and my friend had the sausage and cheese omelette with a side of bacon pancakes.  Both the omelettes and skillets come with a side of buttermilk pancakes, toast, or potato pancakes.  Here are some of the pros and cons from dinner.

CONS: 
1) I ordered the potato pancakes with my skillet..the waiter came out with buttermilk pancakes
2) The waiter asked us if we wanted more water rather than just refilling our glasses
3) We had to wait a long time before our waiter came to check on us and get us our checks because he was busy cleaning the counters
4) When we asked for separate checks, he looked confused and said &#34;oh..separate checks&#34; and acted like most people don&#39;t ask for it

PROS:
1) Food came out fast
2) Food was pretty good and portion sizes were fairly large for the price

I wouldn&#39;t say this was a bad experience per se but it definitely didn&#39;t wow me.  If I&#39;m in the area I might try it again but otherwise it probably would be a pass for me."

It had that Chicago nostalgia feeling to it, so I was alright with it. Still, the booths were a little small. The service was nice and friendly as well. Those were the good point.

However, looks and service can take you so far. The food didn&#39;t live up to the hype. I ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict and the eggs were not prepared correctly. One had only a slightly runny yoke while the other was basically cooked solid. My mother went there a few weeks earlier and had the same experience. As far as the taste, it was great. However, with Eggs Benedict, those eggs have to be spot on, but they were terribly off. If they were spot on, I could give this place a 5-star review."

Not bad considering that Wildberry&#39;s was 1.5hrs. The host did a great job of handling the breakfast crowd and we were able to get a table in a timely fashion. But that&#39;s where our experience took an unfortunate turn for the worse.

We were seated in a section with a rude, old waitress who definitely shouldn&#39;t be working in the hospitality industry. Her attitude and demeanor would have been more fitting of a truck stop diner than a family restaurant. I&#39;ve probably never had such a bad waitress in my life.

I ordered the Special Club #3 which comes with chilled juice. Now, I&#39;ve been to many breakfast places and I always order orange juice. It&#39;s a staple part of my breakfast. But I&#39;ve never seen such a small serving. It might as well have been poured into a shot glass. But considering it&#39;s part of a combo I&#39;ll play along. The food although was satisfying but nothing to brag about. It&#39;s hard to mess up breakfast staples. The place was fairly clean but not well lit.

I don&#39;t see a reason to come back here."

Maxfields seems like a standard family owned pancake house.  Nothing really stands out about it.  The decor is unassuming, a nice selection of booths and tables to accommodate a variety of parties.  Our wait was about 15 mins, which was much appreciated, especially given our pint-sized diners.

Our waitress was friendly enough and made sure that we were offered drinks right away.  She wasn&#39;t super pushy when it came to us lolly gagging about what we wanted to order.  Our food came quickly, despite the restaurant being packed at the time, which was pretty impressive.

From a quick glance, the menu is pretty extensive, although I had a mad hankering for crepes, so I didn&#39;t take much notice of anything else on the menu.  My dining companions got crepes and pancakes.  The food was alright, fairly standard breakfast fare.  The portions were pretty generous, and I felt like I got a lot for my money, which is always nice.

I will have to say that the servers weren&#39;t turned off by our kids, which is worth noting and much appreciated, despite the fact that the toddler of the group proceeded to sticker the table (don&#39;t worry, we cleaned it up before we left).  

I don&#39;t think that Maxfield&#39;s would be our first choice of breakfast places for out next get together, but if our go-to place is beyond packed (again), it&#39;s nice to know that Maxfield&#39;s will be our solid plan B."

Even though the place was packed on a Sunday morning after church we were seated immediately. 

The menu was very extensive with plenty of choice. A bonus was they offered potato pancakes as well as regular. 

I had 2 eggs with bacon, hashbrowns and potato pancakes. Yea I love potatoes! LOL 

My wife had an omelet pancakes hashbrowns.

The serving portions are Large! 5 pieces of bacon a huge pile of hashbrowns and 2 potato pancakes! Like wise my wife had more then she could eat.

Everything was delicious hot and came quickly. The server was very nice but joy overly sweet or hovering.

Nice atmosphere. Very friendly staff. Good selection on the menu. 

Had the BLT club. Came with soup, fries, and coleslaw. So much food. Couldn&#39;t finish it. Here&#39;s the best part of this BLT: it was made with regular sized bacon. None of that thick cut or honey maple bacon business.

Mom had the turkey club which came with same things mentioned above but included turkey. She said it was pretty darn good too. 

Would totally come back. 
Only reason I didn&#39;t give it five stars was because it was so hot in there. I understand e rest of the customers there were of the older population but man...it was HOT in there."

There was no wait which was nice and service was typical diner style...Whadya want? Short and to the point direct which can be easily mistaken as rude. Know what you&#39;re getting into at a diner.

The food was nothing to write home about. I had a ham and cheese sandwich which came with some fries and it was good, but not amazing. The bread was a bit burned. It was a good deal for $8 though. My friend had a beastly meal that came out on three separate plates and couldn&#39;t finish it all for $10. Good prices, decent food.

My dad ordered one of the specials and got an entree along with bread, soup, and dessert - a great value. I wasn&#39;t wowed by the bread; it comes in a basket of assorted breads/croissants/muffins which are served cold, but I think that&#39;s how most Greek restaurants serve their bread, at least from my experience. 

For my meal, I got an omelette which came with pancakes and hash browns. I added fresh strawberries for a dollar. Nothing spectacular but I was happy with my meal. 

Our server wasn&#39;t super friendly or enthusiastic, but she did a fine job checking up on our table, so I didn&#39;t have any complaints about the service.

Our brunch turned out to be less than $30 and the portions were huge (we ate leftovers for days after), so overall I was pretty satisfied. I wasn&#39;t amazed by the experience but have no complaints so I wouldn&#39;t mind coming here again if the opportunity arose."

After a couple more visits, the service is still excellent, the food is still prepared a bit lighter in sugar/salt than other restaurants, the prices are still good, and the portion sizes are still large. Here&#39;s some things that stood out:

The soups here great. After visiting many other family restaurants in the area, I find that this is probably my favorite place to go for soups, especially when they have creamy soups.

The beer battered scrod and shrimp creole here are delicious as well and provide a great reason to come here on Fridays. However, I did not like the texture or flavor of the macaroni and cheese at all.

Regarding texture again, the broiled perch, meatloaf, roast sirloin of beef, and pot roast could&#39;ve all used better texture although the flavors were pretty good. Maybe the meat is simply too lean to get an excellent texture without being higher in fat.

The restaurant is great in potatoes, whether it&#39;s potato pancakes, fried, or mashed they&#39;re all good.

The ice cream is good here too and for some people, if you add whipped cream on top you will be very pleased. The rice pudding is still in my opinion the best in the area. Extra cinnamon and cream make this a real delight.

Still not a big fan of the cakes/pies but the cheesecake is quite nice.

In summary, I still think it&#39;s a great restaurant with nice interior and great prices but texture on some of the dinner dishes could be improved a bit."

My mom ordered an entree that came with soup beforehand. Of course, she ate the soup. When the entree came, it was a disappointment. Her chop steak tasted not-so-fresh. The waitress offered to bring her something else. Someone else had ordered a Denver omelette and said it was good, so she ordered that. 

By the time she got it, the rest of us were almost done eating. Then, when we got the bill, we saw that they tried to charge her for the original entree as well. When she brought that to the attention of the manager, she took off the entree but still charged for the soup. She said that because my mom ate the soup, she had to be charged. So I guess if you eat here, wait to see if your entree is decent BEFORE you eat the included soup or salad that comes out first... even if that means your soup gets cold.  LAME. Overall, the food was just okay, and because of their questionable customer service, we won&#39;t be going back; first- and last-time customer all in one day."

Unfortunately I have not been impressed with the quality of the food at all.  I had a craving for a corned beef sandwich and decided to try Maxfield&#39;s out for dinner.

The bread they brought to the table was stale, clearly left out all day. The sandwiches we ordered came with soup, and the bowl of chicken soup we each received was a bit salty but otherwise good. 

The corned beef sandwich on rye was very disappointing. I can forgive the small amount of meat used, after all, I have been used to some places piling on 3 inches of meat and I never finish a sandwich that size in one sitting, so only an inch or so of meat is reasonable. But the bread was very thinly sliced and not toasted, so it quickly fell apart while eating the sandwich, which had no toppings like mustard or mayo, and I was not offered any of these.  The meat was also not terribly fresh, and had likely just been microwaved before being slapped on some plain bread.

My wife&#39;s gyros was packaged gyros meat, not shaved from a spit as I expected from a Greek restaurant. She only had a few bites before pushing it to the side.

I will say that the french fries we both received in abundance were really great. They had a nice battered texture, stayed hot, and were very tasty.

We ordered an egg, sausage, and pancakes for my son. The scrambled egg was literally tasteless, and the hash browns were soggy and tasted awful. The sausage was a little soft but otherwise fine, and the pancakes oddly tasted a bit like yellow cake rather than pancake, but were generally good.

I did not come to Maxfield&#39;s with high expectations at all, but I was still disappointed. With all the good reviews here I was expecting better.  I&#39;m sure there are some things they do well, but I am not likely to return to find out what those things are."

However, the potato pancakes which can be substituted for the regular pancakes were fantastic. I would go back for those alone.

Maxfield&#39;s is located inside a strip mall on the corner of Plum Grove &amp; Schaumburg Rd. We wanted to get some nice breakfast on a gorgeous Sunday morning and we let Yelp decide.

There were some larger groups waiting outside, but since there was only two of us we got seated right away. The menu is extensive if you figure in the lunch menu, but we were here early so it was breakfast only. I wanted to deviate from my usual omelet order so I got Pork Chop &amp; Two Eggs, and the wife ordered an Athenian omelet. 

I decide to order some Cinnamon Apple Crepes since it sounded delish. Our server was very good as she kept our coffee cups filled and checked in on us frequently. The food came out pretty quick, which was good since I was famished. The Pork Chops were served still in the marinade, and they were so tender and tasty. The wife seemed to be enjoying her omelet so I let her be. 

I must say that the Cinnamon Apple Crepe was fantastic! The sweet cinnamon sugar glazed on top of the apples and crepes was great.

Anyway, I go here often enough that I can write another one.

This is really a great brunch place (or breakfast anytime place). The food is decent, the service is decent (though some waitresses could use a smile sometimes). And the prices aren&#39;t terrible. It also is a rather large place, so you are usually seated fairly quickly. Because it is rather large and popular, if you go at a peak time, it can be a bit noisy.

The reason I came here was to update my previous review (which has somehow disappeared). The change is that they have raised prices recently. Their prices are on par without about every other average brunch type place now. They used to be the best place to go due to being a bit more affordable. There now is not really a reason to go here rather than other places in the area unfortunately, aside from being closer to here, or wanting to have some variety. But, it is a decent place."

This place takes the cake for price point. You can seriously walk out of here full, having experienced good service, and without breaking the bank.

Back in the day it had a better name. It used to be called Sugar Plum. Despite the name change, the place has remained the same and has always pleased. The pancakes are incredible here (the best in all of Schaumpton!). 

Go there anytime before 11AM anyday of the week and you bet your bottom dollar that the average age is well over Social Security Retirement age. But that is always a good barometer of pricepoint and delciousness."

Maxfield&#39;s delivered the breakfast experience we were looking for.  

It&#39;s a neighborhood breakfast spot located at the end of a strip mall with lots of seating, great food with quality ingredients, and local diners.  The breakfast prices are reasonable -- a real value for what you get, too.  The place is clean, comfortable, and presentable -- nothing fancy, but right at home.  The waitresses and manager (an older woman who rules the roost with a keen eye for order and customer comfort) are welcoming and on top of their game.

For breakfast, I ordered an omlette with sweet, crisp apples and cheddar cheese -- my first omlette with fruit in it, and a surprisingly wonderful combination.  My son got his usual eggs and bacon, which kept him happy.  My husband ordered a Mexican style omlette -- very spicy.  All generously portioned and delicious.  The coffee was good and the meal came with a complimentary bread basket that was tasty, tasty, tasty from muffins to chewy rolls.

We highly recommend Maxfield&#39;s.  We would definitely go there again and again if we lived in town."

I found it to be... meh. 

I had a corned beef omelet with hash browns and pancakes. I&#39;ve had better pancakes. I&#39;ve had better hash browns. I have DEFINITELY had a better omelet (it was kinda gross and I didn&#39;t finish it).

This is one of those places where the majority of the patrons are silver haired senior citizens, especially on a Sunday morning. Prices are on par with portion size and quality and seating is plentiful. Menu options are plentiful as well but standard except for their &#34;baked pancakes&#34; and Greek versions of popular breakfast items.

I opted for the cornedbeef hash omelette with a side of potato pancakes and my wife chose a rather plain french toast with sausage and bacon. Both were acceptably well prepared in a standard diner fashion and neither of us had complaints about portions.

Service was attentive and my coffee was topped off, literally, after every 2 sips. Almost annoying but I&#39;d rather have piping hot coffee than lukewarm coffee so I really shouldn&#39;t complain.

Our final bill rounded off to just under $20 not including tip and we left full and satisfied.

I a agree with Cristie B. that this is a good place to get a quick breakfast without the obnoxious wait times of other more popular brunch places in the area. Just some good ol&#39; &#39;merican breakfast."

My girlfriend&#39;s mom loved her avocado omelet, saying it was one of the best ones she&#39;s ever had, and she&#39;s an avocado omelet FIEND.

The coffee, on the other hand, was kind of gross and tasted faintly of alcohol.  According to a quick Google search that may mean that the coffee beans were a little past their prime.  In addition, the service can be spotty and the wait can be long.  All in all, there&#39;s really nothing at Maxwell&#39;s to tempt me away from Wildberry Cafe or Richard Walker&#39;s, and the bad coffee is the final nail in the coffin."

Prices here are very decent. You can have the brunch special&#34; 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, sausages and bacons, and juice for $6-7. Coffee here is pretty bad though!

My husband ordered a mexican omelet, and I ordered the veggie omelet, and the kids split a french toast.  Everything was typical, but I did appreciate the amount of broccoli in my food.

We ordered the Taste of France baked apples and french toast combo for one plate. It was really tasty, but unfortunately they drenched it in some type of cinnamon syrup. Just a little drizzle would have hit the spot, not half the jar. Please serve this on the side!

Another plate we ordered was a feta omelette, which was eggcellent! The eggs with tomatoes, spinach and cheese hit the spot. The side dish of potato pancakes was a real gag to swallow. These were really dry and couldn&#39;t be eaten without sour cream. Please don&#39;t throw them in the pan for so long!

Pros: 
Fun and entertaining
Friendly, engaging staff
Good food

Cons: 
Crazy expensive

This place is probably not for EVERYONE, but if you&#39;re a nerd at heart, you&#39;ll love it. The staff is very friendly and, though a bit campy, very good at keeping in character. 

The price - oy yikes! Tickets are like $60 normally, but I was lucky to have been invited to go when they&#39;re having their fall sale. They also have a Throwback Thursday sale ($36/ticket). The Royalty upgrade is, in my opinion, definitely worth it. Front row alone was too awesome to pass up, but you also get a commemorative VIP towel!

I&#39;m super cheap - in fact, I&#39;ve gone 32 years without going to this because I was always reluctant to spend so much money. But it was a good time.

The real kicker is all of the &#34;fun&#34; stuff you&#39;ll be tempted to buy. Trinkets, toys, even WEAPONS. And if you want a commemorative glass, you&#39;ll pay quite a penny - most expensive VIRGIN pina colada I&#39;ve ever had ($15) just so I could go home with a pretty purple goblet. 

As far as the food - it&#39;s actually pretty good, if a bit simple. And I was surprised to be full, despite the fact that it wasn&#39;t what one would consider &#34;feast sized.&#34; You get a piece of garlic bread, a bowl of soup (tomato, which was really good), a quarter chicken, piece of corn, half an herb-roasted potato and the pastry of the night (in my case, a delicious piece of lemon pound cake YUM). The wench was witty and pretended everything was dragon parts: dragon scale, dragon blood, baby dragon, dragon horn, dragon egg - tee hee!

I was very impressed with the horsemanship and, of course, the King&#39;s falcon! So neat! 

All in all a good time, though not something I could afford to do on a regular basis."
medieval-times-dinner-and-tournament-schaumburg,Lefai K.,WJOjqOmrM2jJxwrlqHIK9w,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,199,597,1z9rDnq_pXWGPsgecMJCiw,4.0,2016-09-07,"Oh man -- I&#39;ve been wanting to go here since I was a kid... now that I have kids of my own, I can fulfill them and not be that creepy guy alone in the playground! In case you don&#39;t know, Medieval Times is a dinner a show, featuring decent food you eat with your hands (no silverware!) and cool storyline of a king hosting a tournament of knights fighting to the death. The venue itself looks like a Spanish castle and inside, the place is pretty cool. 

The ticket itself says you should be there 90-minutes or so earlier than showtime, but from reading other Yelp reviews and just talking to past peeps, this doesn&#39;t seem necessary. They do have a gigantic &#34;waiting area&#34; which is pretty huge, almost as spacious as the stage/arena and seating area itself where you can spend and waste your time/money before the show starts. PRO-TIP: We did a Sunday early afternoon 1:30PM show, and got to the place at 1:00PM, and the timing was perfect -- we had time to check-in, peruse the displays of swords, weaponry, and stare at horses, and before-ya-know-it, it was time to go into the arena. There were plenty of seats at the Sunday early afternoon show, so if you don&#39;t like crowds or waiting, and an early Sunday afternoon is doable, definitely aim to go to this showtime.

Upon entering, you can take a picture with either the princess or king and right before the show, they will take a picture of you and your party with you wearing your souvenir paper-crowns, at your seat. After the show, they have a green-screen for more photo opportunities. All in which case you will have to fork over some dineros to get a copy of. I forked-over the money for the before the show seated picture.

Before and during the show, there are vendors peddling lighted and flashy swords and all sorts of plastic toys. Be strong and say &#34;no!&#34; ha. For those who forked-over some extra cash, you can sit in the VIP section, which is essentially the front row. We opted for the &#34;first-come, first-seated&#34; seats, and we were seated in the second row, which is perfectly fine. In the VIP section, you also get a flag/banner thingy with your knight&#39;s color, to cheer your designated knight on with. Each seat is pre-populated with banners and towels, regardless if anyone sits at the seat or not. 
PRO-TIP: After the show, there were plenty of banners and towels laying around. Feel free to grab em. The waitstaff don&#39;t mind and they said it was fairgame

The waitstaff who serve you the food is extremely friendly and everyone role-played as if we were in medieval times. The menu included:
- Tomato bisque (dragon blood)
- A baked half-chicken (dragon flesh)
- Half bake potato (dragon ears)
- A slice of garlic bread (dragon eggs)
- Apple turnover (no clever name for this one by the waiter)
- Small quarter corn-on-a-cob (I forgot what he called this)
Note: Past reviews from others, indicate a rib, but there were no such thing here.

Overall, food was good, chicken was moist and not dry, and the apple turnover was pretty good. I would agree with others that the tomato bisque was rather too salty for me. They had lemonade, pepsi, water, and coffee as well to wash this all down. PRO-TIP: If you have to shred or separate the chicken from the bones, which I had to, definitely bring your own plasticware and plenty of napkins. I did, and it was money. Everyone said it was a lot of food, but being a beast like me, I was skeptical. I believe it was just enough. If you have picky kids like me, they will find something to eat -- since there were several different food, the kids were able to find enough to eat. 

BATHROOM REVIEW: Located outside the arena, the mens bathroom was roomy and had enough urinals to keep the waiting line flowing nicely. There were 5 urinals (i believe... I don&#39;t remember) and 4 or 5 stalls. The lines moved quickly. Sit or squat? Squat, my lord."

Great deal when you consider the constant deals and coupons that are available for shows.

While the food isn&#39;t Michelin Star worthy -- it is definitely much better than what you&#39;ll find at the majority of entertainment / food combination offerings. Portion sizes are huge, flavors are simple but enjoyable (closer to restaurant than amusement park style food), and the service is extremely friendly. In particular, I have to commend the amazing service I received as my waiter was extremely patient, funny, an excellent listener, and frequently checked up on me to make sure that I was having an amazing experience. From the other sections I could see, it seemed that others were also very happy with their service, especially with how well the servers interacted with the kids.

The show itself is very entertaining and professionally run. Although there&#39;s lots of moving elements, weapons, lights, etc. going on at the same time -- everything was perfectly synchronized. The show included many aspects of tricks with the horses, fights with the knights, some Medieval-themed story, and a falcon show. This is a nice change from the comedy or musical theater shows which are typically the live shows I watch locally.

Overall, if you&#39;re looking for a very unique experience in the suburbs, definitely give Medieval Times a try. It&#39;ll provide a very fun and memorable experience and is a great deal considering that you get a full show, awesome atmosphere,and enough food for leftovers for a reasonable price. Perfect for a birthday party, date, or just a way to treat yourself to a fun experience."

Food was simple but pretty good with soup chicken potato corn and dessert. They have full bar and really neat artifacts. The show kinda dragged at times but it was still interesting.

Because we went for lunch, we were offered garlic bread, a huge piece of chicken, corn on the cob, potatoes and cookies. They were extremely sensitive towards food allergies, and had plenty of alternatives; for example, they brought out a lemon icee for a student with peanut allergies instead of offering them cookies and/or nothing. They provided coffee to the adults, and brought out more food for students who were picky about one thing or another. Overall, they were very kind and patient to our many demands. The food wasn&#39;t spectacular, but it was fun to eat with our hands and get messy! 

The show was super entertaining for the kiddos. Everybody wears a crown with the color of the knight they are voting for, and the Knights pass out flowers (that they kiss hahaha) to various members of their fan group. They had multiple choice questions about anti-bullying and kindness, and really got the kiddos engaged in those tougher topics. Fortunately for us, the green knight won and we were on the green team, so our school went wild! We were also able to take pictures with all of the knights, the princess and the King after the show. 

Overall, I&#39;m not sure I would have loved it had it not been a school function. It&#39;s definitely kid-oriented and a fun family affair, but not necessarily something I would do with a group of friends! I would highly recommend it for another school field trip though!"

My wife&#39;s niece wanted to go to medieval times so we took her for her birthday back in November.  The show was entertaining, but kinda cheesy.  I was a LORD if only for a few hours.  They recommend that you get there @ 6:30 pm a full hour before they let you into your assigned seats.  I guess they want you to buy stuff that you don&#39;t really need.  There were some pretty cool weapons like swords, shields, armor from different periods.  I am kind of obsessed with this stuff even though I don&#39;t need them

The food they served was pretty mediocre.  I never knew that dragon parts tasted so much like regular food. 

The show was ok, but our Red Knight was the runner up.  Kind of like kissing your sister.  So we went from being Lords &amp; Ladies during the show to being normal schleps afterwards.  Oh well Cie la vie."

They let you in before the show so you can buy overpriced items and drinks. The drinks aren&#39;t that bad if you don&#39;t get the &#34;fancy souvenir glass&#34; no craft beer so I settled on a $8 new castle my gf got a double Long Island which he didn&#39;t know how to make so basically just poured a bunch of booze in a couple with ice she was ok with it so whatever I wasn&#39;t drinking it and she said it was good but it was $18

From my understanding the menu hasn&#39;t changed in years. You start off with tomato soup and garlic bread. Followed by a chicken leg quarter, potato and for desert a apple turnover. 

Chicken was good but you need to bring hot sauce if you want it. I was starving so I ate all of it and it was a big portion. The potato was cooked all the way in my opinion so didn&#39;t really eat that. And didn&#39;t care for the apple turnover. 

The show was somewhat entertaining and is really cool for kids. Probably something you could check out every three to five years and look for discounts. Food isn&#39;t band but your basically there for the show anyways!"

So most of what I remember was flashing lights, knights in different colors, and some food you eat with your hands. This time around was pretty much the same thing.

My dad had a hankering for this place since he recently became an intense Game of Thrones fan. So we [my sister and I] decided we can make this a fun outing for him for fathers day. 

They had a cute Father&#39;s Day package going on where he gets a free picture, a cape, and a souvenir 24oz beer mug [filled with the good stuff]. That was cute.

The rest of my experience wasn&#39;t so cute. The show seemed cheesy, the food was flavorful but we had no options for meat or sides. The whole place started with very watery tomato soup and garlic bread. Then for the main course we had baby dragon [1/2 bone-in chicken] which, to me, seemed precooked and re-heated for the masses. Main course was accompanied by corn and a &#34;dragon egg&#34; which was just 1/2 baked potato. For dessert we got something resembling a less sweet version of apple pie (forgot the &#34;medieval&#34; name they used for it, sorry). To have the &#34;full experience&#34; you were supposed to eat with your hands. I asked for silverware. 

We sat in the section for the yellow knight. We lost the third or fourth round. Very cheesy loss. He got &#34;stabbed&#34;. My dad was very into it... but it was Father&#39;s Day so that was the point right? 

Something to note here for my fellow booze lovers: the wench who brings you food doesn&#39;t serve you alchohol so you have to keep your eyes peeled for one or two other people who walk around and take orders. They do have some cool themed drinks. My favorite was &#34;Maidens Kiss&#34; which was a fruity vodka based drink that had some strawberrry and other fruity falvors mixed in.

Overall I would recommend this place mostly to younger people who have some free time on their hands and want to try something new. My dad had fun but people ages 18-35 who don&#39;t have kids might not think agree. Maybe when it opened 20+ years ago the idea was more polished but, ironially, the idea might be a little outdated or appeals to a more specific crowd.

P.S. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of all the tricks, kicks, and prancing they have their horses do.. I don&#39;t agree with animals being used for entertainmenet."

Went for my birthday, I like to do random things.  Anyway, the price per ticket on the website can be reduced with certain codes and coupons, you just have to seek them out but then they hit you will all sort of taxes and fees. It&#39;s pretty abhorrent. 

Anyway, once we got there, it was a lot of fun.  It&#39;s super corny and some of the jousting acting is not spot on, but this is not Broadway, after all. It&#39;s just a good time, if you let yourself get into it. Buy a flag, root for your knight and ignore any lame people that are inspecting for perfection instead of fun. 

The food was surprisingly good for how much they are putting out all at once. You get to eat with your hands and drink expensive dragon&#39;s blood. Overall, we had a really good time."

They have a concept and commit to it 100%. The venue is a giant friggin castle complete with a dungeon amd horse stable. Im always surprised to find that they actually have decent food. Our meal consisted of half chicken, tomato soup, corn, garlic bread, and an apple turnover. The portions used to be bigger back in the day, but they are still plenty filling. You eat with your hands, and that never gets old.

The show is a tacky jousting tournament, but because they give you teams to cheer for, you always feel engaged. You can never get too old to buy a $2 flag and wave that bad boy with abandon while your hero wields his lance. Sadly for us, our green knight was an early elimination. Maybe next time."

All the folks already discuss the meals and options on here, so to the staff who read these, THANK YOU for your amazing and wonderful customer service and truly a unique and fun experience.  To you yelpers who are on the fence about going, GO! If for nothing else than the experience (unless of course you hate the medieval time period and people playing knights &amp; princesses).

I like the concept of a dinner show and thought it would be a unique experience for all of us since neither one of us have ever gone to Medival times.

So I&#39;ve heard this place can get pricey. Had I not had the groupon, it would have set me back 69.95 per person. With the groupon, general admission is $40 pp but it can easily become $60 pp with the additional &#34;add-ons.&#34; Are you celebrating a special occasion? Well there&#39;s a package for that and you get a cake, an announcement scroll and special mention during the show for an additional $16. Okay fine. I&#39;m cool with that. Do you want to sit closer to the main ring? Well that will cost you an additional $20.00 pp for VIP seating... Pictures with the king or princess cost $20 for one professional photo and $30 for 2. Waving banners cost between $2-5. If you have kids they&#39;re going to want whatever light up flashy thing they are going to sell them and those are at least $20+ each. Beer in a goblet? Not sure how much that was but my husband said it was overpriced. If you had to reserve money to spend here, at least tip your servers. I&#39;ve heard a range of 2-6 dollars per person.

The service is excellent and the food as other Yelpers had mentioned is amazing. You get a starter course of dragon blood (tomato soup) along with some good garlic bread. Then it&#39;s off to the mains. With the mains, you are given a generous portion of roast chicken (the call it roast dragon, which by the way was absolutely succulent and delicious!) As soon as I ripped through &#34;the dragon&#34; with  my hands, roasted chicken juice gushed out of the chicken meat. Yum! There was so much chicken left over that I took half of it home with me! With your meal you also get a corn on the cob with a roasted potato. Omg was that potato seasoned to perfection! I wished they gave you a second helping. It was just sooo good. Complements to their chef for a wonderful meal. 

The show was excellent and was roughly two hours in length. It wasn&#39;t just jousting. There was a storyline and competitive sport between the Knights of your choosing. I won&#39;t give all of the show away for fear of spoiling it but the sword fights were cool and as the swords clash and bang against each other you may even get to see some sparks fly! 

This my friends was worth the money along with the great show by the performers. If you can resist purchasing the add ons, it&#39;s definitely worth the trip. At least do it once! I would come back again but couldn&#39;t afford frequent visits as again this place can set you back. Parking is included in the price and the lot is behind the castle."

It was very crowded, as was expected.  The dinner consisted of; your choice of Coke, water, or ice tea, with alcoholic drinks available for an additional charge, tomato soup with garlic bread, chicken (which was too dry), corn on the cob, a baked potato, an apple turnover, and coffee.  The bar was very crowded before the show, and ordering just a single drink took very long.  For vegans, there is an alternative meal.  Not sure what it is, although I do know you get utensils.
     The show was entertaining.  The games were not overly difficult or impressive, but they do a great job of getting each section involved in cheering for their knight.  The final duels were good, a bit repetitive, but it seemed as though the performers got progressively better.
     The main drawback here was the price.  Over $70 per person for a sub par dinner and one drink each just can&#39;t be made up for by an hour and a half &#34;show.&#34;  It wasn&#39;t terrible, and it was relatively fun, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d recommend it.  BTW, I did see somebody&#39;s vomit on the toilet while using the restroom.  So, yes, there are idiots who get THAT drunk at medieval times."

My husband and I visited this past Saturday. We opted for the 4:30 pm show. We selected the VIP celebration package, and it was worth every penny. While we had front row seats, I don&#39;t think any seat in the entire place would be a bad seat! We will start off with the bar, a little expensive but.. You get to keep the glass so that makes the drink reasonable! The gift shop was expensive ranging from like $6 to $60+. There is something for everyone here, they really have a big selection! The food! Oh my goodness, the food was delicious. Yes, you eat with your hands, part of the experience... You do get a warm moist napkin when your finished. We had tomato soup and garlic bread, very good! Chicken, which was deliciously moist and perfectly seasoned, then they added the corn, also delicious with a bit of a smoky flavor, and then the potato. The potato needed a bit of salt but was still good. After that we had lemon pound cake and because we had the celebration package we had this chocolate mousse cake that was absolutely wonderful!! I withheld the fifth star for three reasons, 1. The meal felt a bit rushed, when the wench came back she took the food wether you were finished or not. (I know this is because they have to stay on time and be in the sand!) 2. The fog caused a bit of a breathing issue. It wasn&#39;t terrible, this may have been because we were in the front row. It was fine once we got used to it. And the 3rd reason was we had a bar credit of 51$, when we went to use it our total was like 21$ and it has to be used all at one time... Except they don&#39;t let you buy more than one drink at a time... So we were stuck purchasing empty themed cups, which was fine... But I would have rather used that credit at the gift shop and just paid cash at the bar. I would definitely recommend this place. Great for everyone!!"

Get lost in your surroundings here at Medieval Times.  This is neither the time nor place to take yourself seriously.

Once you&#39;ve opened up, the experience here can be fantastic.  Get there early and get close parking as well as the opportunity to explore a little bit.  You can see the horses up close (but behind bars/windows).  Grab a slushie drink (about $8 for alcoholic version).  Visit the museum/dungeon where they have medieval torture devices ($2).  Or maybe just do a little shopping for capes, robes, swords, and other miscellaneous &#34;Medieval&#34; souvenirs.

A little presentation and next you&#39;re ushered into the arena by your knight&#39;s color.  The show itself is pretty impressive.  Lots of horse-riding, jousting, fighting, and a slightly cheesy backstory to go with it.  All in good fun.  Make sure to cheer for and wave to your knight and you might just get a flower.

Some tips, go during an off-peak night and you&#39;ll be able to sit closer (as well as increase your likelihood of getting a flower).  The food is good but no utensils are provided so be ready to dig in with your paws."

The hotline employees were super helpful and I was able to reserve 10 discounted spots for our friends. We were running late so we kind of missed some of the beginning stuff but it doesn&#39;t seem like we missed much of pre-show activities. It appears that they just try to sell you photos and apparel and souvenirs before the show. Silly me brought this elaborate castle shaped cake I had handcrafted. The Medieval Times employees tried to offer to serve it to us during the dessert course but I refused because I wanted to show it off to my friends and do the traditional candles and song routine beforehand. After being ushered to our seats, we noticed that food service felt a lot like a wedding. There&#39;s one person for drinks, another person for soup, another for the &#34;baby dragon&#34;, another for the dessert, and another for the booze orders and a different person who actually brings you drinks! It was all very confusing especially when it came time to figure out who to tip. When our server announced himself halfway through the meal, I was surprised that they even mess with the formality of having a &#34;server&#34;. The show happened in darkness so on occasion I would spill food or drink on myself. Break out the bibs! As for the show itself, it was incredible! It was like if a Renaissance Faire had professional wrestling! The stunts were at times cheesy, but that didn&#39;t detract one bit from their impressiveness! In the end, I wasn&#39;t able to serve my cake in the dark chaos. Not that if I was given a chance it would have been an ideal setting for a birthday celebration. Everyone&#39;s seat is facing the stage and we were seated all in one row. Some people were able to get their special event announced. Not sure how they did that! We probably missed something at the beginning. After the show, the lights come on and everyone goes to the lobby to take photos and they try to sell you more souvenirs.

Overall this place is amazing. Definitely take advantage of online discounts. My two main criticisms are that it lacks &#34;hangout vibes&#34; and that the food they serve is completely historically inaccurate. Tomatoes, corn, and potatoes are all new world foods! If you&#39;re going to be that inaccurate, would it kill you to give me a fork?"

My fiance and I decided to go here randomly for a date night. A coworker had said she recently went and it was awful and cheesy but we stuck with our plans. The food was pretty good, nothing gourmet, but not bad at all. 

As for the actual show, of course it&#39;s over the top and exaggerated. If you&#39;re expecting anything other than that, well I don&#39;t have any words for you. It was a fun time that provided a night of entertainment. I would definitely come back to take my nephews or even recommend as a fun date night idea for others. 

It is pretty pricey if you go thru Medieval Times but there are always deals through Groupon and TravelZoo which is what we went with."

Now this would be a 5-star review but it is a little too pricey to have the best value and earn that fifth star. But the theatrics, service and food were outstanding. Seriously, the food was better than many typical restaurant&#39;s food-didn&#39;t expect that!

The doors to the seating area open at 7:10 but they say you can get there at 6:15 when you make your reservation. If you do  get there really early, you&#39;re standing around for a while so be prepared for that. They have some things to look at and buy before you&#39;re seated but it&#39;s not enough to keep you busy for the whole (almost) hour wait. If I could do it over, I&#39;d probably get there around 6:50. I went on a weekday. 
Once you&#39;re seated, you&#39;re greeted by a wench or man wench and they bring you something to drink and throughout the show, they bring you food. No complaints about the food! 
The show is pretty magical! You will get wrapped up cheering for your knight! Great family fun for everyone!!!

This place is full of fun from the time you walk in the door. Everything is so well put together. 
The Drinks are good from the bar. 
It&#39;s  so many different light up toys. You are just going to have such a great time.
The service of the waiter&#39;s are just out standing 
You will feel like a Princess.
My son had a great time. (king) The food was finger licking good. And you get a lot of it. You get a full coarse meal Drinks and coffee and Dessert. 

Today was a good day Red and yellow was the winning knight. How cool.
The take home pictures are a little pricey but it&#39;s all worth it. 
This is a place for kids of all ages and party time or even just having some good family time. Get ready to cheer your lungs out and swing your team flag up high.

I saw a Groupon for it and thought what perfect timing. I bought the Royalty tickets and so glad I did! I didn&#39;t know what to expect when coming here. First you arrive and they crown you with a colored crown that will match with your seating area and which knight you will be rooting for. You then walk in and they have all these booths/stations setup for either drinks, souvenirs, photos, swords, etc. 

They do not open the doors to the arena till a certain time and once they do, someone will be there to escort you to your seats. With our royalty tickets we bought from Groupon, we scored front row seats! It was so perfect! I was surprised to see that they had such roomy and comfortable seats and in front of you is your table for eating. Along with the Royalty tickets you get a printed program and a behind the scenes DVD. The show was so much fun and it was so school to see everyone in character and the crowd going crazy over their knight! Our server was in character the whole time as well and the service and the food was great! It was a lot of fun for my son to eat with his hands! 

I was very pleased with everything and would recommend this to anyone who has kids to try it out once."

The show itself is entertaining.  You are placed in a section with a color which represents your Knight.  You cheer for your knight as he competes in medieval games including jousting, sword fighting, and catching rings with his lance.  

I brought my 70 year old parents and my 4 and 8 year old children.  All had a wonderful time.  

The food is quite tasty.  You will get messy, there is no silverware, but nothing outrageous. 

My oldest was knighted before the show started.  For a little extra cash, I believe it was $30, he got his name called by the king to come up in front of everyone and knee down and be knighted.  This came with a picture with the king and a toy sword.  For even more money you can upgrade your sword, for adults.  

I would not pay extra for the medieval torture device tour.  It was not really worth it.  

On a side note, my father is wheelchair bound.  They took care of us immediately.  We were allowed to enter the arena first and select where to sit.  Although we were limited to the top floor area as we could not get down the stairs.  The staff assisted us every step of the way."

Doors open 75 minutes before your event, and we got there right when the doors open, which we later realized was a good call as it got us and our friends really good seats. 

The staff has your check-in down to a science, and after three or four checkpoints, we were in the main hall. There are lots of little shops there that are more geared toward kids, but adults will still find fun things to look at. You can also check out the horses which are over by the dungeon. We didn&#39;t tour the dungeon, but there&#39;s a $2 tour fee. 

Entry to the pavilion was surprisingly organized given the sheer volume of people. We got in and got to our table pretty quickly, and then the show began! It was amazing and incredibly engaging. I worried it&#39;d border on the cheesy, but it didn&#39;t. It felt as authentic as anything can feel when you&#39;re wearing a paper crown. 

The food was the biggest surprise - it was fantastic! You don&#39;t get silver wear, but it was t as messy as I imagined, plus you get ye olde wet nap at the end. 

Medieval Times met and exceeded my expectations. I look forward to coming back!"

I didn&#39;t really think about that, being that everyone gets the same thing kind of banquet style. It wasn&#39;t a big deal, just had to go get a beer to break a 20.

First, if you are planning on going I would recommend signing up for their emails or looking for discounts/savings codes. Thanks to an email I was sent we purchased tickets for $35/pp. Regularly tickets are 61.95/pp, which in my opinion is a &#34;no&#34; (LOL). Upon arriving to the castle is was pretty cool I enjoyed the theme! Before we entered the arena we opted to get drinks as they do have a full service bar. When we entered the arena it was soooo cool (I can&#39;t believe how easily impressed I am LOL) the horses were beautiful, the acting wasn&#39;t bad, and my team (#TEAMGREEN) won (whoohooo!). While watching the show you are served dinner. The menu is as follows; garlic bread, tomato soup, roasted chicken,  corn, potatoes, &amp; &#34;pastry of the Castle&#34; which is like an apple turn-over thingy. The food was okay, and you don&#39;t get utensils -yes, you eat with your hands- but they give you wet naps. Medieval times was cool I would definitely recommend for a different type of night out!

You&#39;re there to feast and enjoy the pageantry of the Middle Ages, to lose the present and feel like chivalry still exists. This is the place to do it! They have great service and I turn into a little kid, no matter how many times I visit. It is a bit pricy, but there are always coupon codes available to save you a decent amount off the full price."

Im a medieval junkie myself so this stuff clicked with me. I love the costumes and i marvelled with the show and performances. The theatrics and all were outstanding! I love the horse shows and im so amazed with the trained falcon. I love the combat and all, fantastico! They even sport this accent to be in character. Expect to get wowed if you are into these medieval stuff. 

My husband surprised me with this on our 1st Anniversay. And boy oh boy, im glad he did! We had the Royalty package and comes with it is a photo opt where you can wear costumes and select your preferred background and they give you the photo afterwards in a medieval themed frame, you get a DVD and a booklet with infos about medieval times, and you get front row seats which is i think the best seat to be at. 

The food was okay but they were tasty and portioned well. You get a medieval bread (garlic bread) with blood soup (tomato soup), baby dragon  (a big chunk of chicken) for the entree with baked potatoes on the side, and a medieval dessert (apple crisp or pie i think hehe). A friend tipped my hubby to bring utensils just in case but we were not aboe to use them. Besides the food were pretty much hand-able food. They definitely encourage you to use your hands as spoon(right hand) and fork (left hand). 

Over-all i absolutely enjoyed the whole medieval experience. Kids will love this place. I remember the father and son sitting next to us had made a funny remark; when the entree was served i heard the kid blurted out to his dad with so much excitemen: &#34;Dad, i got the dragon&#39;s foot!&#34; We all laughed but it was such a cute and funny moment. So this is a must-go for medieval geeks and fanatics like me. Game of Thrones-y anyone?"

They do a really good job at getting people involved and ready for whats to come before you head into the theater.  

My friends and I all commented on how good the food actually was.  The portions were large and the chicken as well as everything else was cooked to perfection.  The only con is that if you want another beer/wine you have to leave the theater, so I recommend getting your cup filled before you go in.  Great place for a fun day or night!"

I would recommend this place to anyone with kids. The dinner and entertainment surpassed my expectations.  The &#34;Feast&#34; is a hands-on food experience, no utensils provided, you get a half of roasted chicken, a half of potato, a corn on the cob, a bowl of soup and an apple turnover over the course of the show. I was very satisfied with the food and how it was prepared.

The &#34;Knights of the Round&#34; Tournament was a great show for kids and adults alike. Much of the show was a display of horsemanship, but there was plenty of  swordplay and jousting. The crowd got noisy and rowdy as the night went on and hey, I did my fair share of cheering. Plenty of kids were having a great time waving their flags and enjoying the sparks fly as the knights fought to the death. 

In the lobby outside of the arena there is a gift shop with plenty of knick-knacks to buy. I really bought in to the ambiance Medieval Time tries to set. With tapestries hanging on the walls and painted coats of arms through out the lobby you really do feel like you are inside a castle. There is a bar in the lobby as well with the usual suspects of beer and wine on purchase.  Don&#39;t get carried away with buying stuff because purchases of everything in the lobby are pricey so focus on taking in the entertainment and food. 

Overall a wonderful experience, the staff was great and treated our group well. The food is what you would expect, tasty and filling. A great night out, a great birthday celebration."

A VIP package for a family of four and one friend was the right price with coupon ($50 per adult and 30 a kid.) Be sure to arrive at least an hour before show time to take advantage of the waiting room which has a horse stable, different knight statues, two full bars, and a costume photo area. Also a king and his chancellor will put on a little floor show. It&#39;s a bit confusing how it all works so it helps to get in early and ask questions on how it all works. The VIP package includes a group photo in front of a green screen (you choose background) but costumes are $3 extra. I was a bit annoyed at that. 

The kids actually liked the food (so did the adults!). The tomato soup was decent, but the real winner was a really well roasted and seasoned quarter chicken. You also get a quarter cob and half a seasoned baked potato. An apple turnover for dessert. The VIP package includes a slice of birthday cake.

The show was great - the Chancellor was awesome!  We were in the Blue Knight&#39;s section and had a ball.  There was a little seating confusion when we first got into the hall, but it was quickly resolved.

The food was fantastic and served by a very pleasant wench (she said it was OK to use that word there, just not at home to my wife).

The sales of blinking lighted and glow in the dark crap for the kids was a little annoying, but not so much that it took away from the show.

Very well organized considering the amount of people who were in attendance.  I don&#39;t know that we would go there with any regularity, but once a year or so sounds like fun.  That being said, it is like an hour drive for us to go there."

As part of my conference taking place in Schaumburg/Chicago, we were provided transportation to/from Medieval Times and an entire show/dinner for ourselves, with the added bonus of the grand finale theme being a duel against our rival organization. The evening before, a handful of the knights and the king&#39;s right-hand man attended the first dance at our hotel and showcased a [well-choreographed] sword fight as a precursor to the evening ahead.
There was quite a buzz while we waited to be ushered into the stadium since we would be seated with our respective provinces. I would suggest not going into the Torture Museum since the explanations are fairly... graphic. 
The evening officially kicked off with the king&#39;s spokesman announcing our Grand President and his wife dressed in Medieval attire on the small stage in the waiting area- what a way to set the mood! As we&#39;re ushered in, the servants and wenches take your tickets, direct you to your area [my seat was thankfully first row], and quickly take any drink orders since they are part of the show initially. 
The show is pretty cool - the performers are great athletes, and the horses are amazing. At times it&#39;s a bit cheesy, but expected. I was elated when our Black &amp; Yellow Knight advanced far into the tournament and threw me a flower; saddened though when he was killed by the eventual winner. The games and activities flow right into one another as does the meal - started out with dragon&#39;s blood, then a HUGE piece of dragon[chicken], 2 veggies and a pastry for dessert. Afterwards, all of the knights sit at their thrones for picture opportunities. All in all, a wonderful evening with 1000 friends!"

The kids portions are the same as the adults even though you pay less for kids. My daughter who is 4 had a great time. Our blue knight was great and interacted with her. He even made her his queen of the tournament, which was cute! Our only complaint would be the pricing of the alcohol drink and the tickets to the museum. The tickets to the museum were $2/person, which doesn&#39;t seem like much, but the museum took maybe 2 mins and there wasn&#39;t anything interesting for kids. In my opinion the museum should be free or not there at all. Other then that we had a great time!"

This place can be a little pricey but it is definitely fun.  It is always fun to walk around to the shops before the show starts.  It is always fun to get the birthday package &amp; get your picture taken with your group.  

The show has changed over the years &amp; they try top keep it fresh.  If you go with some friends this place can be a lot of fun.  The food here is also pretty good.  The servers stay in character so you can&#39;t ask for a fork.

Souvenirs are overpriced as are adult beverages, but come on, this is the equivalent of going to a Cubs game. My major gripe was only being allowed to buy one alcoholic beverage at a time when lines are long and a beer is 8 bucks.  

The staff was fantastic. Our &#39;wench&#39; was fantastic and engaged my daughter. We bought a light up wand and later during the show a guy selling something entirely different said it needed new batteries and took it and brought it back. It was much brighter! What a thoughtful thing to do.

The food is good. I remarked to my family that I have attended a dozen weddings where the chicken isn&#39;t half as moist as this. I expected a child&#39;s serving for my 3 year old and she was given the same portion as us. I thought I would eat what she didn&#39;t, but the portions were so large we brought home enough to feed her another meal which was a pleasant surprise.

All in all, look for deals to defray ticket prices. Treat it like any sports/theme park for the extras. A great time and I&#39;ve been here probably a half dozen times over the last 20 years and the show changes. The smile on my daughters face while spending time with her nana made this a truly special day."

The performance was a little cheesy, however, seemed like the kids absolutely loved it. Got a coupon online so, ended up spending around $34 per ticket. Honestly, I don&#39;t think it was worth $60 per person. Overall, my husband and I had a great time. The horses were amazing!!! I was just a little worried that one of them might get hurt.

I was done here for work with some colleagues - we had a few days for a conference that we were in town for so we had to book the tickets. We sat in the first row and got the full experience. We had mead and the giant leg of turkey to eat. There are no utensils so be prepared to eat with your hands. 

We had a &#34;manwench&#34; as he called himself. After starting we get into the games that we came for. I couldn&#39;t help but get flashbacks to watching Cable Guy and thinking we would somehow be selected from the crowd for some games but that never happened. 

I can&#39;t even explain how much fun all of this was to attend. Would I go back, probably not, yet is worth it to do once."

I went here with my family on a Sunday afternoon.  My 2 year old nephew loved it!  This seems to be a very popular place to celebrate birthdays of all ages - IT&#39;S NOT JUST FOR THE KIDS!!   For almost 3 hours, you can expect to be well-fed (although you must be comfortable eating with your hands as they did in medieval times?), and be addressed by the server as &#34;My Lord/My Lady- our server did this. If you really want to get into it, wear your complimentary crown!

Occasionally somebody will walk by selling overpriced swords and flags that the kids might enjoy.  

FOOD:  I was surprised at how good the food was.  Garlic bread to start, tomato soup, roasted chicken aka Dragon&#39;s Wing, mashed potatoes, Bbq ribs, and for dessert: a delicious peach strudel!

There&#39;s a bar outside the arena, but you can also order alcohol from your server.

There are plenty of bathrooms too which I appreciated - just don&#39;t go at the end of the show or you can expect to wait for a very long time.  

And don&#39;t forget to tip your server at the end of the meal.  It looks tough serving food with all those stairs!

Overall a fun group experience!"

The chicken was so juicy and flavorful.  I wish the soup had been a bit colder so that I could have eaten it all, it was very good.  The potato was a bit dry and under salted but still pretty good.

The entire group was cut off from drinking and we were all kicked out had to wait in the cold for our bus. Trust me I know obnoxious annoying drunks but we were far from being belligerent. It&#39;s apparently a &#34;family&#34; show so don&#39;t go with your friends unless you plan on being silent. Also, show wasn&#39;t great. Kind of boring and bland.

Some things never change.  And sometimes that&#39;s a good thing, because they were always cool from day one.  Point in case: Medieval Times.

Everyone knows what&#39;s in store for them when they buy tickets to this nationwide dinner theater chain.  Lots of fanfare, actors wearing costumes and talking in pseudo-old English accents, jousting, sword fights, utensil-less food, and wenches serving ale.  I hadn&#39;t been to a MT in over a decade, but I was glad to see that not much had changed.

The exterior facade is huge and built to look like a castle (obviously), and the inside is vast, consisting of the main arena and pre-show staging area, where you can spend outrageous amounts of money on tacky souvenirs.  Okay, not all of them are tacky and expensive--like the awesome stainless steel goblet I bought for only $10--but is buying a light up sword for $35 really worth your kid&#39;s happiness?  Can&#39;t answer, not a dad.....yet.

All of the actors stayed in character and did a commendable job rousing the crowd.  As a thespian myself, I can appreciate the effort the king &amp; company put into their performances.  However, several of the knights seemed bored, and a couple looked downright unhappy.  The green knight was far and away the best, always smiling and nodding to our section when his horse trotted past.  Thankfully, he was the dude we got to cheer on!

The food was satisfactory.  A little on the anemic side, perhaps, but tasty enough.  Good garlic bread, TINY portion of soup, bland roasted potato wedges, tasty BBQ ribs, and a decent turkey/chicken leg (whatever, meat-on-a-stick).  The flaky pasty dessert--basically an apple turnover--was a nice way to cap off things.  Service was fine, but I had to laugh when the waitress/wench offered us more &#34;Medieval Pepsi&#34; or something equally silly (they couldn&#39;t just call it &#39;Cola of the Castle&#39;?)  Booze prices were pretty inflated, so I passed.

The highlights were jousting and sword fights among the knights.  While there were a couple instances where the knights fell/jumped off their horses (to simulate getting &#39;knocked off&#39; by the joust) and it looked phony, the majority of stage combat was actually very good.  When they clashed swords, sparks literally flew!  I also loved to see the knights using flails and shields as weapons.

Here&#39;s the TL;DR version--I had fun.  Yeah, it&#39;s pretty gimmicky and not particularly cheap, but it&#39;s just as enjoyable as I remember it as a wee lad.  I would happily return.

Protip: the Orlando, FL location has a working drawbridge and a moat!  Step up your game, Schaumburg MT!"

In fact the lack of authenticity may be what gives the experience it&#39;s charm.

Go for the show, the food is a convenient addition to the show price, and sit back and prepare to cheer at the jousting and sword battles and ooh and awe like a little kid at the gorgeously trained horses.

Meanwhile, you can giggle at: 
- Some of the HORRID fake accents (excluding the main guy and the king who thankfully don&#39;t sound like a freshman drama class)
- Being called My Lord / My Lady by people who voluntarily call themselves your wench
- Repeatedly adjusting your ridiculous paper crown
- Eating (with your hands) a meal composed of 25% ingredients available in medieval times / 75% not available until well after America was discovered (namely: potatoes, corn, tomatoes and garlic)

Revel in fruity drinks like the Dragon Slayer (mango slushie and coconut rum) and settle back for an awesome show."

Enjoyed it since I was young.  Rather than going to a restaurant and just eating, here you get to eat well and see a cool show!  I&#39;ve been rather lucky my knight has won like 75% of the times I&#39;ve attended!  The food is great, like seriously!  Last time I attended there wasn&#39;t a rib, in the past there was always and I enjoyed that.  But the &#39;normal&#39; meal I&#39;ve had here is garlic bread, tomato soup, potato, chicken, &amp; rib (or something else now), and also a desert which is usually an apple pie type thing.  Plan to eat with your hands, because you don&#39;t get silverware!  I enjoy this, some people may not, but they do give you towels at the end of the meal also.  Overall, it&#39;s just a fun place to visit every now and then.  5 stars because I have had 0 problems and nothing to complain about.

 Some things to know:
1. Drinks are expensive.  Kind of like at a movie theater, the prices are very high for drinks, so plan on that, or plan on not drinking a lot.
2. There are deals!  Never pay full price for your tickets!  Check online and find a coupon code!
3. For children &amp; families the earlier show times are best.  The later show times are best for a few buddies and drinking and yelling!
4. Don&#39;t bother paying extra for &#39;priority front row seating&#39;.  I actually prefer sitting a couple rows back, and there are no bad seats in this place, all the seats are pretty much equal!"

I got my ticket off of Groupon, so I only paid for dinner and tip for approximately $40 (which I hear is a much better deal than others had to pay).  I don&#39;t think I would have paid if it was more than $50.

The food was pretty decent.  I did not care for the tomato soup, but everything else was good.  I was worried about the fact that there was no utensils, but they gave out hand wipes.  Thank goodness!  I was filled with what was given to me.  I had garlic bread toast, soup, half a chicken (it seemed that big!), half of a potato, and some apple pastry.  

I enjoyed the show.  The knights fought, did some tournament things, etc etc.  I know the kids really enjoyed it, the ones next to us was really getting into it (they were SUPER upset that our team&#39;s knight lost... then they started to cheer for the bad guy.  My goodness).  I personally was worried that someone or one of the horses was going to get hurt, but nothing went wrong during the show.  I&#39;m sure they have veterinary medical staff available for the animals, since they have so many horses.  

Overall a great experience for children. I wish women were able to be the knight though, that would have been great!"

I can&#39;t give it 5 stars because of the nagging feeling I have that the horses are subjected to abject cruelty...if not in the form of daily beatings, then at least by being forced to endure the canned earnestness of their ponytailed passengers, and their dramatic soliloquies and overall grandiosity. 

I bring this up because I swear that, during the evil knight&#39;s speech about his king destroying this kingdom, etc., his horse rolled his eyes like a million times.

I will say, don&#39;t go frequently, the routine pretty much stays the same (I think it changes every 5 years or so), but it really is entertaining. Beautiful horses, men in tight pants, a stubborn falcon, finger food, the royal party, and all the things you can buy. 
    They say arrive early for various reasons (lines, getting seated, wanting you to buy stuff before the show, some routines done in the lobby, pictures), and upon arrival they do give the option to upgrade tickets. There are various levels of tickets, the basic package all the way to the several hundred dollar meet-the-king-get-knighted-fancy-cup-blah-blah-blah package. Check Groupon and elsewhere, you can often find some deals.
    The food is pretty good: some toasted bread, tomato bisque, a good portion of chicken, a sparerib, a potato, pepsi or ice tea, coffee, an apple turnover thing, and there is also a vegetarian option. Hopefully I didn&#39;t forget anything... it&#39;s eaten with your hands, btw, so don&#39;t look for utensils (hakuna matata, they give you wet naps). Our server was very nice, don&#39;t be a cheapskate with your tip, remember, they have to run around that arena with tubs of food for a whole row, they are probably paid like a server, which means not a lot so they rely on those tips.
    The show is fun. They have the different events and the horses really are beautiful. Have fun cheering for your team! They don&#39;t force you to participate but seriously, you&#39;re at Medieval Times, you&#39;ve already lost some cool points showing up so lose a few more. The falcon was neat, as well. He was stubborn for awhile and wouldn&#39;t come down from his perch, I of course was on his side. The announcer for the evening was fantastic, love his voice, perfect for the role. 
    If you want an interesting insight on Medieval Times, Google the Reddit thread of Q&#39;s and A&#39;s by an old employee, it&#39;s pretty neat! There are other locations around the country, but this one is right off of the I-90 and Roselle Rd exit in Schaumburg."

I gotta say the whole experience takes on a whole new vibe when tiny people are involved &amp; no liquor is present. My nieces had an awesome time and the experience was well worth it - but it&#39;s a one time thing. You won&#39;t catch me taking the little ones back there and the main reason is how things add up.

The wait to get in was very confusing &amp; pretty horrendous. I wasn&#39;t sure what line I was supposed to be in so we picked a random line. It was a mighty long wait to get in. We arrived at the recommended time of 630pm for the 730pm show &amp; ended up waiting about 30 minutes in various lines until we got into the actual castle&#39;s main hall. We had pre-printed our tickets so we bypassed a huge lineup of humans waiting to buy.

After we got inside, my nieces asked me, so what do we do now!? haha Poor little girls don&#39;t understand all the waiting involved at the castle. The whole thing reminded me of waiting at Disney World except if you&#39;re a good planner, you can get away with no waiting at Disney. Sadly at Medieval Times, there&#39;s no avoiding all the crazy lines &amp; waiting around. 

We went up to the gift area and looked over their offerings. I&#39;m the cool, fun Aunt so was planning on letting them each get a light up, flashy thing. One girl picked a sound making light up wand &amp; the other picked the sword that lit up in three places. Fancy! $38 fancy. Also, for all purchases at Medieval Times you have to show your ID (apparently a new policy) and I didn&#39;t have mine on me. Thankfully I had a couple of 20 spots so I could fork over the cash. So...

Pro-Tip: Bring Cash for souvenirs and tips. It just makes life easier here.

The show itself was quite entertaining, well most of it. We sat in the Black &amp; White section at the very end and the little ones complained about not being able to see well. They couldn&#39;t see the King &amp; Princess at all and had a hard time seeing all the action. The beginning of the show was a bit confusing to them but they loved seeing the horses though all I could think about was how I hope they are treated well when not performing. The main actor/narrator guy is absolutely the star of the show and so fantastic! Great accent, on point facial expressions, he really gets into it and just is perfect in the role. The real action of the show comes in when the protective net comes down and the knights start battling. On guard!!! 

My nieces loved the show save for some complaints about viewing things. They also said a lot of the loud noises during the battle got a little scary (huge spiked balls banging against shields &amp; a man snapping a whip, in particular). So if you have children scared of fireworks and things of that nature, this may not be the show for them.

Our waitress was very attentive and my nieces loved being called &#39;lady&#39; and &#39;princess&#39;. I caught her making a few little side comments which made me laugh and were more adult intended. I went with the vegetarian option for dinner which included a starter of hummus, pita bread, celery &amp; carrots - pretty standard fare but the pita bread was warm and delicious. The main course had changed since the last time I went - a stew served in a metal pot of rice, veggies and what seemed to be beans, with a little packet of hot sauce on the side. It was a decent meal but any time the word &#39;decent&#39; is used to describe something, it means it left something to be desired. After seeing my nieces&#39; plates full of chicken, BBQ, potatoes and tomato soup, I will definitely be getting the normal meat eaters&#39; meal on my next visit. The pastry was served hot &amp; flaky with a warm apple center. I quite liked it and found it to be completely sufficient for dessert.

While having dessert, they came around to show us our picture we took with the Princess when we entered the castle. It was just SO cute, I couldn&#39;t resist forking the money over for it. $20 for 1 or $30 for 2. They must just bank on these expensive photos. I paid the $20 so my nieces could have a nice little memory of the three of us there and they appreciated it.

Tipping is the most confusing thing at Medieval Times. Yes, you need to tip. How much is the question? 20% of the tix price would be ridic. I paid $20 not knowing what was right. I&#39;ve read people tip nothing to $2-$6 pp so in the future I will stick with just $5 or 6 pp. It&#39;s also a bit awkward outright telling your server how much tip you are giving them if you charge it.

So is Medieval Times fun? Heck yes it is!
But do they try to gouge every last cent from their guests? Heck yes they do.
$20 for the photo, $38 for a sword &amp; a scepter, $20 tip and the tickets themselves cost $115, with a coupon code mind you.
Of course if you were to get drinks or anything else, that would just add more to the costs. 

$193 for 2 hours of fun makes it a once every 5 years type of activity!"

Once a month my coworkers and I do lunch at a local restaurant and rotate who gets to pick the place. For their picks we did Seafood, Mexican and Italian... and then came my turn. FINALLY. And guess where I chose? Yep... f*ckin&#39; Medieval Times, man. #1 Coworker (that&#39;s what I call myself), strikes again! 

So, it was no cheap-feat coming here, as anyone who glances their prices can see, but they usually (always) have some sort of coupon or discount or buy-one-get-one going one to help soften the blow, though it&#39;s still priced a bit extravagantly for my general tastes, but I figured that I&#39;d waited a year and half to be able to pick the lunch spot, I might as well make it an epic one because chances are I&#39;ll never get to pick again. 

We booked tickets for the Friday afternoon show, which is a bit shorter than their regular show and considered an &#39;educational show&#39;, which we learned as we pulled in and our three cars made up half the number of automobiles occupying the parking lot that weren&#39;t school buses. 

Inside the castle was madness incarnate. You had to work your way through a veritable moat of children to get through to the arena, but that didn&#39;t look like much fun so we ducked out to the bar and got a round of surprisingly reasonable drinks that come with souvenir holograph cups. Score! Plus, the bar wench loved us for being the only people there to order alcohol at 10:30 in the morning... also  probably the only people there who were old enough to order alcohol... besides the King, that is. Obvi. 

The educational show was just that, I guess. But I&#39;m not really the best judge &#39;cause I was kinda totally buzzin&#39; off my Mai Tai... until the garlic bread (which was actually really good) soaked it all up. I got a vegetarian meal, which for lunch meant I got a cold pasta salad and a fruit cup (served with a plastic fork - boo ya!) and the regular potato and corn on the cob side with a chocolate chip cookie happy ending. I actually didn&#39;t think the food was bad. I mean, I never would&#39;ve ordered cold, pasta primavera and fruit for a meal if it weren&#39;t the absolute only option for veggies, but it was and it was fine. The show was holding my attention anyway. 

We were lucky enough to be amongst the green knight&#39;s section (aka- the BEST section) and we kicked the red knight&#39;s ass like none other, practically split him in half with his Medieval weaponry. Red home-dude didn&#39;t stand a chance... especially after our guy got his hands on the stick thingy with the chain and the silver balls that look a whole heck of a lot like truck-nuts hanging off them. 

The show had it&#39;s ups and downs. There was one part where guy comes out on a horses and they basically just prance for like 8 minutes to a song that sounded a lot like the one that plays in Home Alone when it&#39;s the montage of Kevin prepping his house with booby traps for the burglars. The song was great, the prancing lost it&#39;s luster around the 3-minute mark. 

It&#39;s not like a mind-blowing culinary experience, but it beats a $13 popcorn at $20+ movie tickets as far as entertainment, and now that I know how reasonable the mixed drinks are, well, game on!

Joust do it!

*Other highlight: The falcon took a crap right on the King&#39;s throne as he was flying by. Yay, poop!*"

I hate when trendy restaurants are too cool for condiments, but I definitely get it after eating here. Their menu is not huge, but when you do what they do as well as they do it you don&#39;t really need to offer much of a variety. Slow roasted and succulent, they have the type of dragon leg that you can just tell the chef de cuisine puts his heart and soul into each and every night. Sides include a perfectly seasoned potato, phenomenal garlic bread, and corn on the cob that literally melts in your mouth. (once you get it off the cob) Culinarily my dining companions and I were more than pleased with this foodie haven.

Service:3
Unfortunately they lose 2 stars here. :-( Our server was very pleasant and seemed to know the menu like the back of his hand, but sadly was somewhat hard to flag down. He did have quite a few other tables though so i guess its understandable when a popular place gets as busy as they were on our visit.

Ambiance:2 
Retro. Very retro. Seriously, the 1800s called and they want their everything back. Not really sure where they were going with this decor, but if the scents coming from the kitchen weren&#39;t as tantalizing as they were I may have lost my appetite.

Overall: 3 1/2
I&#39;d definitely come back. Even though there are a few aspects I&#39;m not totally thrilled about the place is great for groups and you know it&#39;s authentic cause absolutely every staff member spoke with an accent."

Years passed and I&#39;ve always wanted to go back. I wondered if it would still be as fun as I remembered &amp; if the food was any good. I would go on the Medieval Times website from time to time and check out the prices and feel a strong sense of nostalgia as I would browse the photos yelp.  The prices seemed ridiculously high to me ($228.96 for two adults and 2 children ages 5 &amp; 7) so I never felt it was worth it. Then it happened. Easter 2015 was two days away and I had no plans. We usually have Easter celebrations at our home with egg hunts, basket swapping and lots of food ,drinks and family. This year I wanted to avoid the whole cooking, cleaning and being the host &amp; wanted to do something just my hubby, kids &amp; I. So I Googled Medieval Times coupons and tried the first one I saw which was buy one ticket get one free! It went through and my total was $149 for 4 tickets on Easter Sunday. I was so excited and thrilled that I was going to share this experience with my kids but silently  hoped that after 15 years the show hadn&#39;t gotten shitty. So Eater morning the boys have no idea that they are going to the castle. After they found their baskets and had breakfast we all got showered and ready. Every time the boys asked where we were going, we repeatedly told them we were going to  &#34;have a jousting-ly good time.&#34; They were pretty annoyed. Then they seen the castle and they were like &#34; MOM! DAD! Look a castle!!&#34; My husband and I exchanged smiles  as we pulled in the parking lot and the boys realized this IS where we were going. We bought our tickets online so we passed the line of people who didn&#39;t and walked right into the waiting area. As mentioned in all the other reviews there are a lot of souvenirs you can buy along with booze. My husband &amp; each asked the bartender what the strongest drink was and she said the Royal Knight which was very good and we got to keep the souvenir cup it came in. $14 for the first round and then refills are $8. We bought the kids each a light up sword for $24 each (ouch) and the yellow flag to cheer on our yellow knight was $2. We arrived about 45 minutes early and the wait for the show to start did not even feel that long. I suggest coming as early as possible if you want decent seats. Once seated at our table our &#34;wench&#34; came along and offered drinks and talked a little about the food we were to be served. Her service was just OK. A different wench that&#39;s exclusively for alcohol came along and asked if we wanted to order another cocktail. We  asked her the same question we asked the bartender when we first arrived, &#34; what is your strongest drink&#34;? She stated the long island was the strongest and best so we ordered it. Big mistake do not order it! It tasted like a cup of lemonade, way too much sweet and sour! My husband even left his seat during the show to exchange our drinks for the royal knight drink and we stuck with that the remainder of the night. There was a lot of food and my husband was surprised that it was actually very good. They no longer serve the rib and now serve buttered corn in its place. While I thought the show itself could have been better, I was pretty content with how happy my kids were, how good the food was and my cocktail lol. When we left my children said it was the best Easter ever. So there ya go. Best Easter ever for kids"

If you&#39;ve never been there I suggest getting a small or large group and make an event out of it.  Instead of doing the same boring thing like going to a bar, stop into medieval times!  The food was not that bad, chicken leg, garlic bread and soup, apple turnover and a rib.  It was not that bad at all.  If you&#39;re a vegetarian no worries they have soup and veggies for you plus I believe some hummus. I posted a picture of all the food.  The tickets were pretty cheap but I ended up spending over $100 on drinks!  My friends and I had a blast! You don&#39;t go there for the food or drinks, go for the experience.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to be planning an event to come here every year but once maybe every 5 to 6 years seems ideal!"

I&#39;m an adult and I have only ever come here with adults, and I still have a good time. The trip into the dungeon is worth it - it&#39;s like $2 or something. And as long as you can restrain yourself from buying tons of souvenirs, the price is good overall. The only time I ever paid full ticket price was part of a birthday package. But, please, don&#39;t ever pay the full price for tickets. You can buy them discounted everywhere- Groupon, Craigslist, all over. 
The food is alright, and one thing I have to really commend this place for is their ability to accomodate food allergies. One of my friends can&#39;t eat at most restaurants because they cook everything on the same stoves, cross-contaminate utensils and countertops, etc. My friend can actually eat here without getting sick, which is probably why he keeps having parties here. You can also get vegetarian (not sure about vegan) options. 
If you have a couple drinks at the bar before the show, you&#39;ll probably leave feeling pretty full and satisfied. The extra cake and virgin daiquiri you get in the birthday package is almost too much. 

I swear, the black and white knight always loses, though, what&#39;s up with that?"

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It was a fun and different experience that my whole family enjoyed. 

The food was good, better than I expected actually. I didn&#39;t like the no utensil rule, so I asked the waitress if she could bring some to us. Luckily, they have some plastic flatware for people who need it.

I&#39;ve been going to Medieval Times for nearly twenty years, and have always had a great time as both a kid and as an adult. 

If you wait for a promotion (which happens pretty often), the experience is pretty reasonably priced. Last year my wife and I took advantage of the Valentines Day deal, which gave us each a glass of wine, a framed photo, dungeon tour, and a bunch of knick-knacks for $99, in addition to the full meal and show. Just keep checking their website and Facebook, and you&#39;ll eventually come across a great deal. 

The castle itself is well decorated and fun to explore. The staff is all dressed up and in character. Everyone who works there has been pleasant and helpful in my experience. 

The food is surprisingly excellent! I&#39;m a vegetarian, and was quite happy with my hummus/veggie plate and 5-bean stew. I remember the chicken being tasty as well, during my meat eating days. Our waiters have always been friendly, quick and accommodating. 

The tournament itself is pretty spectacular. The actors are obviously very well trained, and put on an impressive performance of horsemanship and stage combat. A different house wins each time, and I always find myself grinning and laughing as I cheer on my favorite knight as he battles &#34;to the death&#34;. 

I recommend Medieval Times to anyone. It&#39;s a great time all around that you&#39;ll remember for years to come!"

To be honest, it was kind of crappy:

Pros:
- The whole place seemed fairly well-run.  It was clean, things started on time, and servers were courteous and professional.

- Having read the reviews I expected that the food would be awful.  It really wasn&#39;t.  The chicken was actually pretty good and the portions were certainly ample.  The Texas Toast, though, was worse than the frozen stuff I can get in the supermarket and the hilarious single rib was fatty and bland.

Cons:
- The show was nothing to write home about.  Over the course of nearly two hours, I didn&#39;t see a single thing that made me say, &#34;Wow!  How&#39;d he do that?&#34;  I would say that the knights are competent at best.  They can ride horses.  They can do some reasonably passable choreographed sword fighting.  But they don&#39;t really do any stunts and I don&#39;t see how they could with the size of the arena.  

Maybe the falconry exhibition would have been cool if the falcon hadn&#39;t decided to perch up in the ceiling for a minute or two while the king awkwardly ad-libbed.  Actually, that was kind of funny.

- As everyone has mentioned, the tips should be included in the price of admission.  The way they&#39;re doing it now is obnoxious.

- I&#39;m pretty sure they threw in a completely random and unexplained $8 &#34;processing fee&#34; when I reserved the tickets on their website.  

- Drinks were weak (although not quite as ridiculously expensive as I expected).  

- There is absolutely no reason to show up anywhere close to an hour early.  We walked in five minutes before the start time and we were fine.

Miscellaneous
- There&#39;s one thing I don&#39;t really get about this operation.  As far as I can tell, this show is really aimed at a seven or eight year-old.  But then it really gets quite violent at the very end, which is sort of jarring. They also don&#39;t seem to have a kid&#39;s meal option.  What little kid needs half a chicken, a rib, a bowl of soup, bread, and dessert?  It&#39;s really kind of weird."

My wife was asking me for years to go I finally gave in. My instinct was right. First off we waited 45 min in a crowd so tight we couldn&#39;t turn around while they gave their stupid speech and then tried to call in certain people by colors even though we couldn&#39;t move. It was beyond stupid from there it only got worse. Bad food horrible show the Knights looked like 98lb girls was embarrassing. I&#39;m ashamed I was even there. Do not waste your money on this disaster. I would rather sit in court for two hours than sit through that again. They should change the name from medieval times to mediocre times. I&#39;ve had more fun getting a tooth pulled than that joke. Fire everyone and close. You owe me 2 hours of my life back

My boyfriend found a groupon, so we went and we werent expecting the food to be great because his dad kinda put in our heads that it wasnt anything special.
On the contrary, the food was good! better than what we were expecting, on the plus side, YOU EAT WITH YOUR HANDS, awesome.

What i liked
- eat with your hands duh
-you get to keep the cups you get with your alcoholic drinks.
-horses are awesome
-all the knights have long hair
- everyone speaks like they&#39;re from Asgard (Thor, come on people)

What I didnt like
-Sitting front row, squished between people. the lady next to me spilled her beer on me :-(

overall, its really cool, definitely something you should experience especially since there aren&#39;t that many medieval times in the country.
A good thing to bring your kids to!"

The food was slightly above average, the kids loved having the opportunity to eat with their hands and not get yelled at by mom and dad.  The entertainment is very good, although very clearly choreographed and staged.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think the performers do put a lot of effort into it and I think the choreography is how they keep it safe for them, I just think they could do a little better job not making it so obvious.

Now the price was pretty high and they do seize every opportunity to extract more money out of you (drinks, souvenirs, upgrades, etc.)

I think the key is to show up pretty early to get a good seat.  If you&#39;re going on a weeknight it appears there aren&#39;t a ton of people visiting so you can get very good seats without paying for the upgrade packages.

It was one of those great experiences for the kids. I expect it was a once in a lifetime experiences and probably not something will be coming back to any time in the future, but that&#39;s purely from the standpoint of once you&#39;ve seen the show you&#39;ve really seen it all.

Highly recommended for a reasonably good meal, a very good show and overall a highly entertaining evening!"

Dost thou knowest the time?  &#34;MEDIEVAL TIMES: DINNER AND TOURNAMENT&#34; time! Let us go tither!

I was following my social media &amp; saw the venue had awesome Medieval Times, &#34;Joust for the Cause&#34; t-shirts. I have been through full surgery twice in April to remove a breast mass, so I emailed the &#34;contact us&#34; via website about where to buy/get a t-shirt being a huge supporter of October as Breast Cancer Awareness month. I certainly &#34;Go Pink&#34; &amp; support &#34;Fight for the Cure&#34; everything the very best I can. I was emailed back saying, they would love to ship me a T-Shirt free of charge &amp; to please confirm my mailing address. (I must have been on file from multiple prior visits over the years or for being signed up on their email lists.) A couple weeks had passed &amp; I was still waiting at months end. I replied to the email if they ever shipped 1 since it didn&#39;t make it to me yet, but if available or lost in mail I was still interested. I was kindly replied to that they were sorry for the delay (They were sorry? It is my pleasure to have received your gift, kindness, and modesty in that way!) but were trying to find me a size small &amp; weren&#39;t having much luck nearing month end (my guess would be contacting the sales coordinators at the other castles). This was beyond thoughtful effort &amp; my gift arrival was exceedingly generous beyond expectations. This is all a gift, so any good person shall be grateful for ANY size shirt delivery at any time. I was THRILLED that my email led to a package on my doorstep, the when opened included: A t-shirt, a pink Medieval Times goblet of fantastic quality - metal, durable, the splendid ones you see on the Castle&#39;s bar for sale &amp; the most heart touching part was an envelope enclosed w/ a letter. The unfolded letter read, &#34;Our Kingdom is in need of a Fearless Warrior &amp; Survivor Just like YOU! Enclosed you will find two free tickets redeemable at the Chicago Castle.&#34; The envelope had a post it stuck to it reading, &#34;Hi Amanda! Feel free to call me directly @ ###-#### to book your reservation. -Nereide Crisologo; Sales Coordinator.&#34; WOW. Talk about a company, sales coordinator, or INDIVIDUAL person going above &amp; beyond. I am tremendously thankful for everything, including people like you. The company is blessed to have you on their staff, &amp; customers are hugely lucky. I am happy just crossing paths w/ people like you! Godspeed!

I called to book my tickets &amp; chose the cheapest day I have seen all year: Black Friday. $30 for ALL seats. We were granted the best seats I could ever imagine, front row of the mid blue section. I had a friend from Germany (working on an internship for his PhD in USA for 3 months) visiting &amp; wanted to show him OUR castle. Germany has real castles, but we have the BEST castles with the whole set-up that makes the entire evening at Medieval Times so grand. We pulled in the free parking lot and he giggled &amp; said, &#34;That&#39;s a castle? That is very cute!&#34; Follow-up after visit, he was DELIGHTED by everything inside; Staff, Museum, Bar, Feast, Knights, Real Horses, Attire, &amp; SHOW! Neddy &amp; Medieval Times - I cannot thank you enough in words. You have been a Godsend through a very long tough year. What you have done for me, &amp; the friend I was able to share it with, was nothing less than amazing. I have always loved Medieval Times, but now will forever be a loyal fan of your business from the bottom of my heart. To reach out like that to one person is remarkable. In life, we can&#39;t do everything, but we can do something. I have reached for a hand, &amp; you reached back to my HEART. Godspeed to you! Neddy: Thanks-thou art most kind my fair lady!

The castle is most beauteous. Arrive early &amp; see the Medieval Torture Museum. It&#39;s a small walk through that is painfully fascinating! The bar makes excellent drinks &amp; even the normal cups are plastic holographic keepsakes. Mayhap I will fetch the ale. Yay, methinks so! I had 2 pina coladas He had 2 beers.

Dinner is served 1 item at a time during the show. The Feast: Garlic Bread, Tomato Bisque Soup, Oven-Roasted Chicken (Dragon Leg per the Royal King), Spare Rib, Herb-Basted Potato, Pastry, Coffee. Beverages included (unlimited refills) are: Pepsi, Diet, Iced Tea, Lemonade. A vegetarian feast is available &amp; I hear they are served silverware. Silverware? Nay, methinks not during this era! Methinks thine art cheaters!

Ye cheer for a knight of thy color section through the games followed by mounted &amp; ground combat. The noble knights ride out like strapping Lords atop majestic horses. Our blue knight was grand! Ye art quite handsome. I have been admiring thee. Ye did well in the games &amp; combat. HUZZAH! Tis most splendid! After the show, you can meet your knight for a photo. I asked if I could sit on his lap or chair edge. He said, &#34;Certainly.&#34; Greetings, Blue Knight! How fare thee? Perchance we shall meet again. Fare thee well, My Lord!

Medieval Times- Cheers for an &#34;out-of-the-ballpark&#34; evening &amp; spectacular customer service!"

Cheeses and Game of Thrones had a baby, it would be Medieval Times. Special note, Medieval Times is not a good idea for those with equinophobia (fear of horses).

After all of these years and a recession, it&#39;s amazing that Medieval Times is still in business. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed myself. For starters, they had beer and not just your typical Miller products but Newcastle Brown Ale. $6 for a 16 ounce beer - not bad when you&#39;re used to downtown prices. The price doesn&#39;t bother you as much after being called &#34;m&#39;lord&#34; from the bartenders. 

All of the knights had long flowing manes with facial hair - I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were previous Metallica cover band members. The entertainment was a medieval version of WWE style action and choreography. Just like professional wrestling, you think it&#39;s stupid in the beginning until you get sucked in and can&#39;t help but cheer along. The actors did a great job of keeping in character. In particular, the announcer had an excellent Old English accent - definitely better than Tyrion Lannister&#39;s. But like Game of Thrones, there was a lot of dialogue and I didn&#39;t understand the plot but kept watching anyways. 

There is something about Medieval Times that brings out the child in you. Maybe it&#39;s something about girls and horses and boys and swords. For horse lovers, the horses are definitely an attraction since you&#39;ll see horse choreography at its best - expect plenty of galloping and prancing. For the boys, you&#39;ll see plenty of clashing of weapons from maces, long swords, to battle axes. If you want to add to your collection or take a special souvenir home, you can even buy real swords. You can get a claymore or a rapier to add your chainmail set. Purchase $200 worth of value, you&#39;ll get 50% off a shield - perfect for the LARPer in your family. 

For the overall value, we got a deal for buy one get one free so it ended up being $35 a person. Not bad when you think about it in terms of a two hour show with dinner. Otherwise, I would not recommend going for the full price of $59.95 for adults. It&#39;s equivalent to watching a movie and going out to eat for dinner but for the whole family.

In the end, Medieval Times is really for the children. For parents, here is a breakdown of why Medieval Times is great for your child&#39;s next party:

1. Children are well behaved and seated which makes large groups easy to manage
2. There are horses and plenty of them
3. Two hours of entertainment that also comes with a full meal
4. Your children will become the coolest kids in school afterwards"

Man was I wrong!!!!

This was our first visit, went for hubbies bday and it was one of the coldest nights this winter---thought we were going to be the only people there--but luckily some other cray cray people wanted to come out for an evening of entertainment---and lovely liquid libations to warm them up.

It is a little on the pricey side if you pay full price but they were running a promo where all tix were $35, kiddies $29--tolerable---they are great at upselling a variety of packages.  Actually I would say they&#39;re pretty good at the upselling game.  The show started at 7:30 but they encourage you to be there at 6:30---so you can be bombarded by all the randomness from the wine bar, main bar, glitter tattoos, things that light up/glow, torture museum---I give them props---they&#39;re just trying to get that paper! We opted for the &#34;Royal&#34; upgrade $10 more--includes VIP seating, program, banner to waive, behind the scenes DVD.

In terms of the drinks at the bar--thought I was going to pay and arm and a leg, but the prices were actually pretty decent and about the same as going to any other restaurant bar.  Lots of yummy concoctions in fanciful cups.  Kiddies had their non alcoholic slushies in the knight head cups--and they were happy.  Food was actually a lot better than I expected it to be--bonus!--not the best since its food for the masses--but could have been a whole lot worse.

The upgrade was totally worth it for us---we actually got upgraded to the front row----so my group was giddy, tipsy, and feeling good with a touch of brute excitement.  Luckily we were seated in the area of the winning knight so we had a blast cheering him on.  The show actually had a nice variety and it wasn&#39;t just a bunch of jousting dudes with long hair on pretty horses.

Staff was attentive and all were really nice.  My youngest was given a &#34;token&#34; (sash that said queen of the tournament) from the winning knight....so she was excited.  We did a lot of screaming, yelling, eating, and drinking!  It was a great knight!!! (wink wink)"

My DIY bowl was amazing! As a resident of the Bay area, this place immediately evoked Asian Box for me. I have to say, while the concept is identical, ShopHouse tasted much better. I was not expecting that. Nice surprise!

I am stingy with 5 stars and give them only when they&#39;re truly deserved, and ShopHouse takes the cake in this style of food. (I can also confidently give this rating as my friends and family have been coming since it opened and raving about it to me over the phone.)

I am not exactly thrilled that this once gluten-free establishment recently added wheat products to the menu, but I am still so happy that they have so many gluten-free vegetarian options.

I highly recommend the tofu, even if you are a meat eater... it is really good!  I love the texture and the flavors.

I like places like this because they have a really good nutrition calculator online so if you&#39;re health-conscious like me, you can always look up what you&#39;re getting.

A pair of freebie lunch cards were burning a hole in my wallet, so I had no qualms about cashing these in on the last Sunday in July.

For the longest time, I always thought of these guys as the &#34;Asian Chipotle&#34;.  So it made all too much sense when I learned that ShopHouse&#39;s parent company is, in fact, Chipotle.  The build-your-own food format is the same, the look and feel of the restaurant&#39;s interior is similar, even the friendly staff are on-par with those at the Mexican variant.

The vouchers -- from an Elite event back in mid-February, hey hey! -- were good for a free bowl of whatever.  So we worked our way down the line and built our entrées as we saw fit.  Neither LeAnn P nor myself found the chilled rice noodles to be an appealing &#39;base&#39;, so she got brown rice instead.

I went with the steak laab, which wasn&#39;t a great choice, as I wound up eating literally everything except the meat, which was coated with something unexplainable and crunchy (toasted rice?)  Meat shouldn&#39;t be crunchy.  Like ever.  Maybe next time I&#39;ll remember my mistake and opt for the meatballs instead.

All the others toppings and accoutrements were great; even the red curry tasted fine with the roasted green beans and pickled vegetables.  LP enjoyed her selection more than I did mine.  Their mango-coconut mini dessert was just as adorable (and tasty!) as I remember from a previous visit.

I was more than a little bummed that their beer on tap (Daisy Cutter, a personal favorite) couldn&#39;t be served to me, because no employee working there was over 21!  State laws are all fine and good, but when daddy can&#39;t get his 3pm drink on, sh*t doesn&#39;t bode well.

Fortunately, we got comped not only a bottled ginger ale and a fountain beverage, but ALSO one of the mango-coconut rice parfaits for the inconvenience of being denied alcohol.  That was nice of them (and frankly, the act of generosity saved their butts a star).

Bread = 3.5
Circuses = 4

Their wall of Sriracha is a saucy sight to behold (teehee), and the dining area was kept clean of any garbage.  Employees were chill.

Recommend?  Sure.

But I wasn&#39;t exactly BOWLed over."

I&#39;d heard of this southeast Asian concept chipotle a few years ago when it was in the works. Didn&#39;t realize that there was one so close to me - finally got to try it today! 

It was a nice change in flavor - I made my own bowl and got half meatballs/half chicken over brown rice, with green beans, red curry, crispy garlic and herbs.   The curry was definitely fairly spicy. My friend got the shophouse bowl which had green curry - also delicious. We tried the spring rolls which were pretty good as well.

Obviously not &#34;authentic&#34; southeast Asian food, because you kind of get to create your own thing but with ingredients that could be found in SEA food. That being said, nobody calls Chipotle &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican food so why should this be any different? Who cares, it tastes good!"

Service is fast, friendly, and helpful. ShopHouse is owned by Chipotle so their concept is similar. They offer a menu you can select from or you can create your own bowl. It&#39;s southeast Asian cuisine, which is new to me but it&#39;s pretty good.

My first go around I went with their spicy noodle bowl because I love spicy foods. I must warn you (just like I was warned), this spice is no joke! The flavor was great, but it was a heat where you either had to just keep eating or drink a lot on between bites! Honestly, too hot for me.

Second time around I got smart and decided to create my own bowl. That way if it was too spicy I only had myself to blame right? Right. Well I ended up avoiding the heat all together and went with a peanut sauce, but my combo was very good: jasmine rice, chicken, beef, pickled veggies, slaw, garlic, peanut and vinegar sauce.

I love that their meals come with a spring roll. If you&#39;re ever thinking about getting dessert, do! They offer a coconut parfait that is delicious.

Overall a good fast casual restaurant. Friendly service, reasonable prices, and a great location. It&#39;s to be noted that they offer beer as well. ShopHouse is nothing I&#39;d go out of my way for, but if I&#39;m in the area it&#39;s a nice quick food option."

The service was quick and friendly and I love me a fast casual restaurant. The space itself is on the smaller side but lends itself well in location and concept for plenty of hungry Schaumburgers (is that a word?) seeking a fast Asian inspired lunch. 

The options, just like its parent company Chipotle, are fairly limited. I choose with the peanut chicken rice bowl - I&#39;m a sucker for peanut sauce anything. The bowl itself wasn&#39;t overly stuffed and while I definitely had enough food and more, don&#39;t expect gargantuan portions that you&#39;ve witnessed at Chipotle. While the items in the bowl tasted pretty fresh, there wasn&#39;t much pizazz and the peanut sauce wasn&#39;t overly flavorful. 

Schaumburg has its fair share of both fast casual and fantastic Asian cuisine. While ShopHouse is a fine addition that broaches these too categories, there are plenty of fast casual and Asian eats that do a much better job on the flavor scale."

In short: 
IMO the flavors are SUPER MILD (fyi, my threshold is &#34;mild-to-moderate&#34; heat).

If you want a dish with ANY spice, I suggest the Red Curry sauce, PLUS get the chilies on the side!

_____________________________________________

Bowl #1 w/Tamarind sauce:

chilled rice noodles, chicken satay, squash with Thai basil, green papaya/cucumber slaw, Tamarind sauce, and crispy garlic.

Verdict: 3/5

Holy minescule amount of chicken! The bowl was VERY noodle-heavy without enough chicken to balance it out.

The Tamarind sauce lent a very light, somewhat tangy flavor. I couldn&#39;t taste the garlic.

Spice? What spice???
NONE of the ingredients contributed even a minescule amount of heat.

The ONLY plus is that the bowl is so &#34;light&#34; that I ate the whole thing - before a pilates class, no less - without feeling like a glutton.
____________________________________________

Bowl #2 w/Green Curry sauce:

brown rice, steak, green beans, green curry sauce, pickled veggies, fresh chilies on the side (exceptttt they gave me this green stuff - not the pretty red chilies showcased in everyone else&#39;s pics..)

Verdict: 4/5

There was more meat this time, so the bowl was FAR more balanced than my first.  I liked the flavor of the steak - both that and the beans were lightly charred, but no &#34;burnt&#34; taste at all.  

Flavor-wise, it was fine, but had hardly ANY spice.  The green curry lent a VERY mild heat; anyone who likes even a remote amount of spice will want to add the chilies or Sriracha. I added the green chilies and it was soo much better!
_____________________________________________

Bowl #3 w/Red Curry sauce:

brown rice, steak, green beans, squash, red curry sauce, pickled veggies, and Herb salad, w/ green chilies on the side.

Verdict: 4/5

MUCH better flavor-wise! The heat was still on the milder side, so I&#39;m thankful I asked for those chilies again! This was my most balanced and generous bowl ingredients-wise. 


Soooo, during this bowl creation, I asked for pickled veggies and the worker accidentally put on papaya slaw. No biggie: I asked if she could just remove the slaw from the top and replace with the vegs. She said &#34;Ok,&#34; but the next thing I knew, she TOSSED the WHOLE BOWL in the GARBAGE and started a new one! WTH?! Apparently she was TOLD to THROW OUT THE ENTIRE BOWL!  Why?! If I had known before she pitched it, I would have just taken it. So wasteful!  Sheesh.

Service: 5/5
Each time I&#39;ve visited, staff was friendly and smiley.


Other:
I&#39;m a fan of their compostable containers. Make sure you transfer those leftovers to another container, though, because otherwise things get leaky.


Overall impression? 
Shophouse is the perfect example of a 3.5-star rating. It&#39;s a nice addition to healthier assembly-line fast food, but the scrimping on ingredients (and $1+ charges for additional veggies) will keep me heading back...

...to Chipotle."

Fast, casual, and made to order? For $7 or $8 a bowl to boot?

It all sounds good on paper, but like the 2016 Chicago Bulls, it doesn&#39;t necessarily have the right chemistry. Shophouse says its food is influenced by SouthEast Asian cuisine, specifically Thai and Vietnamese.

I had the Shophouse Bowl, which had pork and chicken meatballs on top of jasmine rice covered in a green curry with roasted corn. The pickled vegetables (sliced carrots, radish) definitely come from the Vietnamese side while the curry is Thai. The meatballs were definitely a Chipotle Mexican Asian fusion.

While the mashup of ingredients tasted fine, I couldn&#39;t help but desire authentic Vietnamese or Thai. There just wasn&#39;t enough curry to cover the rice, and the meatballs were... well they were okay.

Warning for those that are sensitive to spicy dishes - Neely everything has a healthy amount of heat to it. I&#39;m someone who can handle the spiciest kimchi chigae, so I&#39;m no wimp.

Service was fast, friendly, and it seems all the lines have moved from Chipotle to Shophouse, at least during lunch.

Unfortunately, my stomach later regretted my choice of food. You can say that the empire struck back. Ugh. I think I&#39;ll hit up my local hole in the walls for the real deal and skip the regret my body felt from fusion confusion."

You get to pick what you want in a food assembly line like Chipotle but the food being offered are more Asian Fusion. It is a unique taste and very convenient for a quick food stop/lunch break. However, I am not a fan of the Americanized take to these Asian dishes. It is very healthy and I can tell that all the ingredients are made fresh, but it&#39;s just not like typical authentic Asian dishes that I am familiar with.

So you get to pick a base (white rice, brown rice, noodles, or salad); a type of meat (chicken, laab, pork &amp; chicken meatballs, and tofu); vegetables (broccoli, corn, squash, &amp; green beans); sauces (various curry sauces, peanut sauce, and tamarind sauce); and then garnishes. 

Overall, you can be very creative and add whatever your heart desires but if you&#39;re not sure what taste good with what, you can always play it safe and order a pre-made bowl. 

This location also serves beer and ginger ale sodas that are really yummy!

The hubs and I had lunch here during the week.  The dining room is on the small side and you need to get really close to the people next to you if the place is packed.  Luckily there was enough room to have a one table buffer between us and the guy to our left.

The concept is common these days, stand in line, pick the options you want, pay, then sit and eat.  I got the chilled rice noodles, chicken satay, green beans, peanut sauce, pickled veggies, herb salad, green papaya salad, and thai hot sauce-bowl.  I also got an unsweetened ice tea and some spring rolls.  

The food was good.  I would say the flavors are a Thai-Vietnamese combo.  The price is pretty standard for fast service lunch places.  Two entrees, two soft drinks, side of spring rolls for $25.  I would come back here...maybe for a salad or rice bowl...further investigation is needed."

Immediately after landing our plan was to head over and give this Chipotle owned chain a try. What is great about this place was that it is actually 100% gluten free and dairy free! Perfect for me who has celiac disease and a dairy allergy, I can have literally everything on the menu! For our bases we got rice and salad. For the meat option I chose half meatballs and half tofu. For veggies I went with the squash and the broccoli and for the sauce knowing me I went with some of the spiciest and some of the vinaigrette. Then I finished off my bowl with all the topping options.

We ended up getting sodas and two of the mango rice dessert cups.
Now for what I liked, I really enjoyed the meatballs they had great flavor. The entire bowl was quite tasty and really flavorful. The mango rice dessert was very small but also just the perfect ending to our meal.

The problems I had were just basically one thing and that was how spicy the meal was. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be so hot. What did it for my bowl I think was the Thai chiles on top which just made the entire bowl flaming. I had to have a full drink next to me the entire time.

Overall though I really did enjoy the bowl and am definitely hoping for one to show up in the San Francisco Bay Area. The employees were so friendly and willing to answer any questions I had. Everything was clean as well which is always a good thing to mention. Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area.

It wasn&#39;t until I found my combination of ingredients that I was addicted and I can see the same thing happening for others at ShopHouse. 

ShopHouse is part of the Chipotle chain that focuses on Southeast Asian (SEA) cuisine drawing influences from Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The setup is very similar to what you would find from the streets of Bangkok where you choose the type of ingredients and toppings all in one bowl. For fans of SEA cuisine, you&#39;ll appreciate the amount of flavor and textures from the fresh ingredients and spice combinations for only $8. The flavor profile might be too strong for some since there is a level of heat in most of the dishes. Notable items on the menu: green beans (flavored with a chili jam), Vietnamese style meatballs, and Thai papaya salad. Find the combination that suits you best and the addiction will quickly catch on.

This would have been a five star experience if they allowed for double scoops like at Chipotle, had more vegetables to choose from, and had chopsticks. Despite what the cashier said, people in Thailand do use chopsticks specifically for noodle dishes. I would know since it&#39;s where my family is from."

I&#39;ve been asking Chipotle to bring ShopHouse to Chicago on social media for months. I feel partly responsible for bringing this disaster to us. Sorry guys. I love Asian food and I love Chipotle so I figured this would be a success. Not so much. The flavors aren&#39;t down pat. They aren&#39;t Asian.. They aren&#39;t even tasty Americanized Asian flavors. They&#39;re just meh and bland. Very bland. I highly enjoyed the pork and chicken spring rolls and if in the area, I might stop in for those.

I didn&#39;t enjoy the bowls though. I went for the Shophouse. I don&#39;t recommend it. First, it&#39;s not real curry. I&#39;ve never had curry with not even a hint of coconut milk, until I tried ShopHouse. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any coconut milk in it. The meatballs were so skimpy. I chopped them up so I had enough for my bowl, but I ended up still having half of the rice left after finishing the meatballs. In fact, I brought the leftover rice home and made chicken sausage and STILL had more left. If you adore rice, then this might be a good concept for you. I mean I like rice, but damn.  My husband got steak laab with rice and green curry. I liked his steak a lot and there was plenty of it in the bowl, but again the curry. BLAH. He also had the charred green beans, which I liked.

Also, why are you being so effing skimpy on the veggies? Most businesses will over-veggie you (I definitely understand skimping on the protein, but why are you skimping on the slaw?) They use tweezers to put certain things on your bowl, so expect two pieces of &#34;salad&#34; on top of your bowl. As with new businesses, I&#39;d say &#34;oh they just need to perfect things&#34; but this was not the case. 

We came here on date night and it was so off putting that an employee was on break talking about marijuana the whole time. The entire time. We were in here almost 30 minutes and the topic never changed. I know I&#39;m probably being picky, but a manager was seated at the next table over and didn&#39;t tell him to stop talking about his hobby at work."

The most positive thing I can start with is the customer service and the patience and smiles that came from the staff. The crew here is definitely well trained and knowledgeable about the menu and options. The manager even swapped my son&#39;s chicken when he found it to be too bitter from the charring.

My son really enjoyed the meatballs, which I found to be the second best thing about ShopHouse.

Aside from that, the food was average to good at best. I found it lacking in flavors except for the really strong bitterness of the charred beans and corn.

My take is that Chipotle wowed is with its simplicity, freshness, and familiar flavors. ShopHouse broke from this concept by taking a risk with strong (traditional?) burnt flavors and departing from the conservative palettes of its loyal Chipotle demographic.

I want ShopHouse to do well, but I will likely wait for some menu updates before returning. I wish the marketing lived up to my expectations."

I actually really enjoyed my food. I got the chicken bowl with brown rice, green beans,papaya salad,and red curry sauce. The green bean was charred and although I love the grilled taste, I dont think it&#39;s very good for the body to get it frequently (carinogens and all). The papaya salad was a great addition to my bowl and I would definitely get it again. The red curry sauce was incredibly spicy, just FYI for people who can&#39;t handle it. I also bought a mango coconut rice parfait which i really enjoyed as a snack later in the day. 

The only thing I wish they would change is being more generous with the toppings. I guess I&#39;m spoiled from Chipotle since they seem to put a good amount of toppings to give me my money&#39;s worth. Shophouse seemed to be a little more stingy. I don&#39;t like how we are limited to only one type of vegetable. They don&#39;t seem to give that much in the first place, so being able to put more than 1 type of veggie would be preferred. 

All in all, I would come back to try a different combination of the foods."

It&#39;s basically a Vietnamese/Tai version of Chipotle. 
When we arrived, the friendly fellow behind the counter asked if this is our first time here. When we said it was, he explained how everything works in a very hospitable kind of way. 
When I asked if they have MSG in any of the food or sauces, he double-checked with the manager, a kind and knowing young woman, who assured me that they don&#39;t and insisted that their food is the same quality as their flagship restaurant. 

Pros:
+very chipotle-like
+owned by Chipotle, so the food&#39;s the same quality (I suppose this could also be a con)
+good amounts of parking 
+good for lunch
+very friendly staff
+sells beer, if you want it

Cons:
- doesn&#39;t sell juice
-a little loud
- We actually got bored of it half way through - you know, when you&#39;re no longer eating it because you&#39;re enjoying it, but because it&#39;s in front of you and you&#39;re still hungry. 
-1 bottled water costs $2.00"

And I was not disappointed. The setup is similar to Chipotle (as to be expected) and there are many choices for rice/noodles, protein, veggies, and other toppings. I ended up going with the ShopHouse bowl with a little tofu on the side. The bowl was amazing! A perfect bend of flavors topped with cilantro. I had a Jasmine tea ginger ale which was totally worth it. Additionally, I tried the rice pudding/mango dessert. For $1.90, it&#39;s worth the pocket change. 

Bonus points for having a vertical and horizontal (more upside down &#34;L&#34; shaped) glass in front of the line. Because it&#39;s a total pet peeve of mine when people peer over the glass and point or hang their DNA over the food on the line. So bonus points for having some protection from that.

I think they should have a tofu option that is truly vegetarian (it is soaked in fish sauce and therefore not an option for non-meateaters). Otherwise, no complaints!

I wish this place was closer to me, because I would definitely go more often! Please put a location in Naperville or Aurora!"

Upon walking in we were greeted by a very young, friendly staff, rattling off their schpeel about being a part of Chipotle, same process just with Thai cuisine. That was a bit of a hit on my expectations as I&#39;m not a huge Chipotle fan, but I&#39;ll try anything once. 
Choice of carb, protein, condiments, and sauce. So here&#39;s the nitty gritty;

The food
Pros:
Build your meal per your preferences. Brown rice was cooked pretty nicely. They let you try if you have any questions before you decide.

Cons:
Medium to lower quality food. Very similar to Chipotle, with unbalanced flavors, over cooked veg and a very mass produced flavor (that&#39;s the best way to put it). I definitely recommend the rice, as the noodles were both an odd texture and had an artificial taste. As a vegetarian I can&#39;t speak for the meat, but I tried the tofu prior to ordering and it was over cooked, tasteless and chewy, so double veg was where it was at. For double veg. though, it definitely was not much at all, and as stated before they were a bit overcooked and kind of bland. 
 Vegetarians BEWARE, ask about fish sauce in the dishes as you assemble.  It was only after my bowl had been completed and rung up that we were informed that at least two or three things in my bowl had fish sauce it...

The service:
Very friendly kids, a little unprofessional and uninformed, but well intentioned and helpfully. We were even approached by an extremely sweet employee to check in on our experience and given logo coupons for our next visit.

Overall an okay fast casual option, might have to give it a bit of time as they are fairly new and need to find their Grove. Personally probably won&#39;t be back on a regular basis, as I&#39;m not a fan of spicy, but I&#39;ll probably give it another try if only to use that bogo coupon hah."

Essentially ShopHouse is kind of carryout, quick serve, Vietnamese restaurant built on the Chipotle approach to Mexican cooking. For me, ShopHouse delivered nicely. 

I had the steak Laab and spiced it up with the spicy green beans, green curry sauce and some hot peppers. The combo worked great with no particular food drowning out the rest. 

The mango coconut pudding thing for dessert was a nice way to finish. The mixture of the fruits works great and the way it&#39;s served in a little shot glass is perfect too in terms of portion and presentation. 

Sadly, Schaumburg is a little out of the way for me. But if I am up this way again and feeling Vietnamese food, I&#39;d definitely visit ShopHouse again."

It&#39;s got that fast-casual eating experience - where you feel like you&#39;re eating quality meals with out compromises.

I got a white rice bowl with half meatballs, and half chicken, topped with the peanut sauce, and pretty much said yes to all of the other ingredients they asked if I wanted. Probably should have dialed down what I added, as some of the things I added were a little too spicy for my liking. Chicken I noticed was way too finely diced - didn&#39;t really appreciate that; however, the meatballs were pretty good. 

I also tried the cold spring roll thing - ehh, i wouldnt bother on this item."

Well what can I expect from the makers of American burritos??? A star for location, another one for value, and meh throw in another star for their chicken 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Chipotle but a very American gourmet southeast Asian dish is just not for me I guess. I don&#39;t get the meatball option. Sounds like a ball of unused meats fused together. It&#39;s more of like an amalgam of confused meat. IMO, the meatballs don&#39;t belong in this equation. 

Anywho, the Chipotle style of make your own meal/bowl is so passé and unoriginal. Especially when you get charged for everything &#34;extra&#34; unlike their counterpart where you can load up a bowl to make a 5 pound meal until you can&#39;t even make the tortillas meet on your burrito or can&#39;t close the bowl because it is whopping with all the extras you&#39;ve managed to cram in.

This was my first visit, so I went with the Thai Chicken Peanut Bowl. It certainly has some heat to it, but it was very tasty! The peanut sauce as not as sweet as a typical peanut sauce, but mixed well with the brown rice, corns, carrots, cilantro, peanuts and spicy chicken! I got some green beans mixed in too.

This would be counted among the worst of them, both for lack of taste and lack of options.  Not a single one of the ingredients (4-5 each of meats, sauces, veggies) interested me. What I got was a totally average bowl of what might be compared to leftovers.  They didn&#39;t even have real chicken, just some chicken meatballs, which were admittedly the best thing about the meal.  But the rice, the curry, the corn, the veggies, all of it was just so... meh.

And to add insult to injury, it cost $8 per bowl.  I could get double the portions of better food for that price at the worst of the local Thai takeout restaurants.

Huge disappointment, will not give it another chance when there are so many better options."

I went on opening day when they were giving free bowls...but sadly the line was down the block and I went somewhere else. I finally got back there yesterday to give them a go.

I&#39;m not feeling it. I tried. I wanted to. I really wanted to. But I just didn&#39;t find it delicious. I found most of the ingredients to be really random and don&#39;t mesh together quite well. I went with a pretty basic combination and thought I couldn&#39;t go wrong with various foods I liked - well, I wasn&#39;t right. While it was edible, I just didn&#39;t find it fantastic.

Jasmine Rice - The rice was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous. No complaints with my bowl base.
Pork &amp; Chicken Meatballs - Everyone loves their meatballs! I liked them just fine but didn&#39;t find them amazing. They have &#39;fresh herbs&#39; in them but silly me didn&#39;t think twice about that bit of them. Part of the fresh herbs is cilantro. I know cilantro is a huge part of Southeast Asian food...but it&#39;s one food that absolutely grosses me out. So thanks to that gross little green herb, I didn&#39;t enjoy the meatballs much.
Charred Corn - I actually liked this. I didn&#39;t love it and may have preferred just plain ol&#39; corn without the char. However, I had no issue with this. I think generally people would prefer less or no char on their corn though. And honestly no other charred veggies sounded appealing to me.
Peanut Sauce - It was okay. I didn&#39;t get the flavorful oomph I was looking for in their sauce that I had hoped would tie my whole dish together. I don&#39;t think I will get this next time and will try a different sauce. 

I&#39;m weak and found my dish to be quite spicy using the most mild ingredients offered. It wasn&#39;t overpowering though and was kind of the good type of spice flavor. Something just wasn&#39;t doing it for me with the flavors together. Maybe I picked the wrong sauce?

I wish they had more than 4 sauces. I wish they had more than 3 meat options. I wish they had better pre-decided flavor combos. I wish everything was priced $1-2 less. I wish 3 of the 6 pop options offered were working when I went in (yes half were marked out of order on day 4 of being open). 

On a positive note, they have Half Acre Daisy Cutter on tap. I only saw one draft beer and then a few others in bottles in a fridge.

Love the concept, will try them one more time (though I&#39;m in no rush), food just isn&#39;t on point though. As many before me, I hoped it would be on the Chipotle level &amp; that this could become a regular lunch spot while I&#39;m work...but nu uh."

This food is just too exotic for most.

For those of you that like standard Americanized Chinese fare like sweet-and-sour pork, beef and broccoli, stirfried noodles, and sweet pad Thai etc. this is not the place for you.

Agree with several of the reviewers that said that the choices and combinations are daunting and lead to bowls being put together with flavors that may not be pleasing to those new to SE Asian cuisine. However, anyone who has been to Southeast Asia specifically Vietnam, or Cambodia etc. and has liked the cuisine they found there - and I am not talking about at westernized Asian food at hotels - those folks are going to find the flavors at Shop House Asian kitchen to be tasty and reminiscent of those they enjoyed in that part of the world although they might not be 100% &#34;authentic.&#34;

Several of the reviews seem to have been written by people that very well likely work for competitive restaurants. They have one or two reviews total to their name and give extremely little description but rant negatively and then give one star or two stars. 

Our experience for lunch on a Sunday was very pleasant. Of the eight tables that were occupied five of them were Asian families, the other three, one of them including ourselves, were non-Asians. 

The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming when we told them it was our first visit. We ordered a salad bowl with pork and chicken meatballs, thebsquash and Thai basil warm vegetable, Tamarind vinaigrette, herb salad, pickled vegetables, papaya salad, and all four of the garnishes.

The meatballs were probably not as warm as they should have been, which concerns me given Chipotle&#39;s recent problems with food safety. They should&#39;ve been a lot warmer.

The salad base, the herbs, the pickled vegetables and papaya slaw were all extremely fresh, with good crunch. The Tamarind vinaigrette was light and had just enough sweet and acid to perfectly accent the flavors of all of the ingredients we chose. 

Instead of the red Thai chili pepper garnish listed on the website today&#39;s choice was green Thai chili peppers. The relish was very hot, with a good kick of garlic and really brought together the entire bowl. 

They did not have trays and did not ask if we were eating in or taking out and put lids on all of our containers before we even paid. They were being efficient but that created waste in lids that did not need to be used.

All in all we were extremely pleased with the nutrition calculator online and the flavor of everything we tasted.

We will definitely return."

I tried a combination of 2 bowls I had tried previously.  A salad bowl with meatballs.  The meatballs were by far my favorite thing on the menu!  I usually like noodle bowls too, but for some reason they aren&#39;t hot noodles here, and that sort of turns me off.

The layout is very similar and you can &#34;create your own bowl&#34; or choose one of their pre-selected combos. I typically like a lot of heat in my food so I trusted them with their spicy combo--HOLY FIRE in my mouth (comparable to the Blazin&#39; Wings at Buffalo Wild Wings)! I suggest getting another tamer sauce to go with the bowl. The mango + rice dessert was pretty yummy although my friend did not enjoy it. I like unique combos but think it&#39;s an acquired taste so buyer beware!

Good selection of beer especially for a quick serve joint. Fresh ingredients and powerful flavors. I&#39;d go back again and tweak the order for I can really enjoy it next time!"

I recently went to a Yelp event here, and had a pleasure of meeting one of the corporate representatives. The corporate representative explained the background behind Shop House, and about the food itself. This was an awesome way to become more familiar with the Shop House brand.

At Shop House, you just walk up to the counter to start your meal order. You have the option of either picking your own ingredients, or selecting one of their bowl combination suggestions.   I ordered a noodle bowl with the meatballs, green beans, and peanut sauce. The noodles are chilled, but all of the other ingredients warm them up so it&#39;s barely noticeable. I was extremely  pleased with my bowl creation. I love spicy foods, and my bowl mixture was perfect for someone that loves spicy food. I did notice that most of the ingredients were described as being more on the spicy side though. Their spicy ingredients, meats, and sauces might pose a problem for customers that don&#39;t like a lot of spice. I also tried their spring rolls, and they came with this delicious dipping sauce. The actual  spring rolls were super fresh and light. 

Overall, I would say that Shop House is a great place to check out if you enjoy South Asian inspired food, and need something quick."

I dunno, guys. Part of me thinks this place is just experiencing new business issues, but part of me just thinks the food is not good and not worth the price.

We were so excited to try ShopHouse. We&#39;d heard of it in the news and even thought about trying it during our travels. We love Asian. We love Chipotle. How could it go wrong?

Oh, but it went wrong, so very wrong. See, unlike Mexican (tex-mex) or Italian food, Asian food seems to incorporate a lot of complex flavors that the average layman like myself does not understand. There&#39;s a lot of opportunity to fck this up if given the chance, and by laying everything out and allowing people to choose their own adventure, it&#39;s just asking for trouble. 

I decided to be safe. There are about 4 pre-selected combos you can choose from. And I figured that by choosing one of them with a few minor modifications (noodles vs. rice) I would be okay. 

Notsomuch. 

I ordered the ShopHouse bowl but with noodles. My wife ordered the spicy bowl but with noodles and chicken. Mine was just a jumble of flavors that just didn&#39;t seem to go together, and I was left with that godawful sweet and bitter charred corn being the takeaway flavor that I can&#39;t seem to shake. The noodles were cold, which is weird because there were also hot items in the bowl. It felt conflicted. And the noodles were so slimy and slippery that none of the sauce really stuck to them. 

I&#39;m usually a fan of curries, but this was just not good. Also? I agree with Courtney C. The meat to other stuff ratio just didn&#39;t do it for me. And also also? Why are the bowls so big if they only fill them about halfway up? Quantity is never an issue at Chipotle, but they were downright conservative on the portion size here. And at $20 for two for a meal, I expected to get full. 

Okay, on to a few of the new-business issues. 

1) There are no trays. My wife recently had surgery and is only one one foot right now. So I have to carry both of our entrees and drinks. The employee at the register offered to help, but really? Just get some trays, guys.

2) There was no actual can in the garbage can.

3) And this was a big one. There was no iced tea. I filled my cup about halfway and got a cup about half full of liquid and a huge pile of tea grounds floating around. I asked one of the managers to refill the tea, but by the time we finished eating it still hadn&#39;t been filled.

Since I wasn&#39;t getting a drink, I asked for a refund on it. I walked up to the register and here&#39;s where a serious customer service problem came about. They treated me like Whitley in that episode of A Different World where she goes into the jewelry store and the salesperson basically ignores her completely. 

The girl at the register totally ignored my request and helped other people in line while I stood there. She didn&#39;t say she would be right with me, she just stood there helping everyone else. I didn&#39;t even cut. They weren&#39;t actually in the line when I walked up to the counter so this was just a major customer service mishap. 

The manager who originally built my bowl (and who I asked to refill the tea) seemed to notice what was going on and quickly tried to solve the problem by handing me a bottle of fancy iced tea. It was a nice gesture, but I&#39;m afraid I still left with a bad taste in my mouth, and not just because of the burnt corn."

I originally wanted half steak and half meatballs but they were just preparing some more meatballs and the wait was too long for my liking. However, the staff brought a couple out to our table when they were ready which was awesome. They in itself were very tasty. 

I agree with many other reviewers that they went beyond charred on various ingredients. I frantically don&#39;t mind some burnt flavor but the steak was very hard to chew and nearly inedible. With the overly burnt steak and green beans, my mouth was left with a very unpleasant bitter taste for the rest of the evening. The chicken was fine. The veggie garnishes were enjoyable. I found the spicy red curry to be very lackluster and practically nonexistent. Good thing the proteins were seasoned and the garnishes provided enough flavor. Boo pretty much got the same thing as I did except with the green curry sauce. He enjoyed his more than I did.

Overall, satisfying portions which is consistent with Chipotle. Awesome service as well. However, the food left a bad taste in my mouth...literally. My experience would have been drastically different if the food wasn&#39;t so burnt but hopefully it was just an off day? Wouldn&#39;t mind giving this place a second try."

Well, this is a Chipotle for Thai/Viet food. The coke machine is even in Thai and they&#39;re playing Thai music (I think?).

You can pick from brown rice, jasmine rice, cold rice noodles, or salad. Then you can pick your meat, steak laab, pork and chicken meatballs, chicken satay, or organic tofu. Then you pick from a vegetable, spicy green beans, charred corn, or seasonal veggies (butternut squash or broccoli). Then a sauce, green curry, spice red curry, peanut sauce, or tamarind vinaigrette. Garnishes include green papaya slaw, pickled veggies, or herb salad. Toppings are crushed peanuts, toasted rice, crispy garlic, and Thai chillies.

I got, half brown rice half jasmine rice, half steak laab and half chicken, spicy green beans, spicy red curry, papaya slaw, herb salad, toasted rice, crispy garlic, and Thai chillies.

I wanted to try everything so I also got spring rolls and the coconut rice and mango parfait.

The spring rolls were just ok. I&#39;ve had better, but these were different. They had ground pork and shrimp with papaya slaw and herbs. The dipping sauce was really good. It tasted like a peanut, curry, fish sauce kinda thing.

The bowl was really good. The steak seemed overcooked, but maybe it was supposed to be like that. The chicken was very tender and juicy. I overheard one of the managers talking and he said they only use thigh meat! Yum!! I couldn&#39;t taste much of the sauce, but everything was nice. A good balance of spicy, sweet, salty, crispy, soft just like how I know Thai/Viet food to be.

The coconut rice and mango parfait was soo good! It didn&#39;t taste like there was much in it except rice, coconut milk, and mango puree. Omg. So good! And only $1.50. I&#39;m def getting it every time I come here.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be here again. Everyone working here is so welcoming and helpful. It&#39;s different from Chipotle, but the same concept. Well they do own them soooo... :)"

The mango parfait didn&#39;t go well with the toasted sesame seeds and there was too much salt in it. I left with a little bit of a belly ache too. Chipotle is in a different game than ShopHouse unfortunately.  I was really hoping it would be another go to- like Chipotle.

We went with a BOGO deal thanks to a fellow yelper, and got several more while there.  I had the cold noodles, and I wouldnt do that again.  Everything was extra watery, and the other stuff just slid off the noodles rather than blended.  I was nervous about the heat after reading other reviews, so I stuck with less spicy, but I probably could have done a little more heat.  I did like the green papaya slaw and pickled vegetables.  I also liked that you could taste the sauce before hand, so I knew I made a good choice with the green curry.  My husband got the steak, and it was literally just a bunch of char.  Big turn off for him.  I may go back and try the rice, but only because I have more BOGOs."

I am not a fast food person, but when I do need a fast fix, I always hit up Chipotle. I am very glad to have another option for healthy fast options at my leisure. They had some incredible choices, but because I could not make up my mind, I did a bunch of halves. For starters, I got 1/2 brown rice and noodles, 1/2 tofu and chicken, 1/2 corn and 1/2 green beans. I topped it off the herb salad, crispy garlic, fresh chilies, and 1/2 peanut sauce and 1/2 spicy red curry.
By now, I know you are asking what&#39;s up with all of the halves? Well, for one, to get whole portions would have been way too much food for me and for two, they charge you for anything extra, so if you do halves then you are not charged anything.
The food was great except for the chilled noodles. They tasted overcooked to me and maybe they are supposed to be that way, but at any rate, I am not a fan. I will definitely go back to Shophouse for another bowl."

You can tell there are regulars who know exactly what they like. There isn&#39;t necessarily one &#39;right&#39; combo - it really comes down to personal taste. I think one downside is there *are* combos that don&#39;t work due to the wide variety of flavors to mix and I think this turns people off. I also think people go in expecting the flavor of Americanized Asian (lots of sweet sauce stir fried with noodles). This is NOT Shophouse. You can&#39;t go in expecting Chipotle flavors either, because that&#39;s not what this place about. Its traditional Asian cuisine.

Their chicken is very similar flavor to Chipotle and the meatballs are great. FYI- their veggies are supposed to be charred - they are NOT burned. 

I&#39;m not sure Shophouse will take off, though. It will be interesting to see. I don&#39;t find myself craving Shophouse over Chipotle. The ingredients are similar and I am worried there&#39;s not enough differentiation from Chipotle.

Would I try it again? Yes, I will definitely be going back but only because they&#39;re giving out free bowl coupons. I feel the flavors aren&#39;t quite good enough to pay for."

I don&#39;t know what is going on here but they just don&#39;t seem to be as on top of things as Chipotle. They didn&#39;t have any chicken available, so people had to wait.

I had been watching ShopHouse for the past couple of months as it was being built near my work. I personally am not a big fan of Asian food or cuisine. But, when I discovered it was styled after its parent company, Chipotle (of which I am a big fan), I decided it was time to stop in and see what this &#34;Asian Chipotle&#34; was all about. They have a strong assortment of mixed Asian veggies (ie. broccoli, green beans, and squash) as well as sauces (ie. curry, peanut sauce, and vinaigrette). Pick from a couple of pre-configured dishes or mix and match (rice, noodles, and salad) as you please. It&#39;s a simple style that still manages to offer plenty of flavor and variety. All in all the food was good but could use some quick tweaks. Service was very good and the employees were friendly and should be complimented for checking up on me. Location is very clean and a nice place to hang. Depending on how they improve on my return trips they may earn four stars. Worth trying.

The Food: (Score 4/5)
I got the Vegan Bowl and an Unsweetened Tea for about $10. The bowl contained: brown rice, organic tofu, seasonal veggies, peanut sauce, pickled vegetables, herb salad, and crispy garlic. The flavors were bold, tasty, and satisfying. Unfortunately the brown rice was a little under-cooked. The grains would become a bit too crunchy distracting from the delightful tofu and veggies. I hope to return and experiment with other combinations. As a new location I expect that they&#39;re still trying to get their groove all figured out. 

I would also love to see more side options on the menu. Spring chicken or steak rolls are available. A single mango parfait is a possibility for desert. Not much else if you&#39;re looking for the munchies. Overall these aren&#39;t bad combinations, but they should definitely experiment with additional menu items. Locally sourced and organic options are present and appreciated! Decent portions for the price. However, considering the plethora of appetizing Asian cuisine locales that are available in Schaumburg, ShopHouse will be hard pressed to stand out in the crowd. 

*(Updated 7/09/2016: After multiple visits I am happy to report that their food has improved. As a result I am raising this score from a 3 to a 4.The rice and noodles are well cooked and the vegetables have a good texture. For those who have complained about flavors clashing I would recommend asking the employees for dish suggestions. They are extremely knowledgeable about dish ingredients and offer suggestions for building flavorful and complementary bowls).

The Service: (Score 4.5/5)
Friendly from start to finish. When I walked in I was warmly greeted and checked up on throughout my lengthy stay. I decided to hole up and finish some studies. The workers were kind in offering to clear my trash. They also engaged in small talk and wished me well in my studies. All around great crew!

The Location: (Score 4.5/5)
A neat, clean, and well-lit location that is perfect for lunch or dinner. Bathrooms were clean and the dining area is a perfect size. Chipotle&#39;s sustainable practices shine through in every element of this locale (ie. LED lighting and low-flow faucets). Workers were quick to clean up after every guest. A great study.work area. They don&#39;t have WI-FI, but you can easily mooch off of the next door Starbucks.

Conclusion: (Final Score 3.5/5)
A casual place that has good flavor and strong potential. Get those veggies a bit fresher and the rice a bit more cooked and I&#39;ll become a returning customer. They just have to find some ways to be more unique and innovative in a crowded food market."

I ordered the meatballs w brown rice along w green curry sauce, and papaya slaw. At a glance, the bowl was very attractive.  Taste wise, it was bland...I think it was missing salt or some ingredient that I can&#39;t seem to pin point.  I love green curry but this curry was off.  Either lemongrass wasn&#39;t included in the sauce or not enough coconut milk, or they didn&#39;t use cane sugar...something...sorry, I know my Thai green curries.  Something was off.  It&#39;s definitely not authenticate enough for me.  Granted, this is an Americanized food chain.  Also the slaw,  the entire time I was thinking of green papaya alike Thai restaurants but it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s not vinegary at all.  I was kinda disappointed.

I&#39;ve been here twice now, both times in December, and I&#39;ll agree that there are some flavor combinations that simply don&#39;t work out (in particular, the meatballs are too strongly spiced to mix well with the curries imo). Both times I came, however, I overall enjoyed my meal, and was served enough food to eat for lunch the next day. The staff is definitely going through their growing pains and aren&#39;t necessarily the most expedient, but I also have never been in while it&#39;s busy. 

The bowl I ordered and really liked was brown rice, chicken, green curry, broccoli, and garlic. Yes, the food is absolutely NOT authentic, in the same way that Chipotle is a sorry excuse for Mexican food.

I will forever defend Chipotle to the death, and I was really hoping to swell up with those same feelings of satisfaction and loyalty for ShopHouse.

But ShopHouse was just not good. From the portion sizes to the flavors, this place fell short across all my expectations. 

--Ahem--

Problems:
- Charred everything: the green beans, corn, and steak were the worst offenders. I could give the corn a pass because it tasted pretty much like backyard BBQ corn. The green beans were quite spicy (ShopHouse does get credit for warning about that), but they were also bitter from the char, and that was just a foul compound with whatever sesame or peanut oils seemed to be used in the cooking and flavoring process. 
- I changed my mind, the steak gets its own spot as a problem: THAT STEAK. oh that steak. In short, it was practically inedible. It was tough, bitter, shriveled, and didn&#39;t look or taste like any beef I&#39;ve ever encountered in any of the authentic Vietnamese or Thai restaurants I&#39;ve frequented across the city (especially the gems in Uptown); if the beef was supposed to mirror Malaysian or Indonesian techniques, then it did a poor job inspiring me to want to explore those cuisines in more depth. Blech.
- The scoops of the vegetables were so meager; there just wasn&#39;t enough to complement the rice and/or salad sitting at the bottom of the bowl. A long line of people waited behind me, so I didn&#39;t really feel like exploring all my options for mixing half-and-half or adding extra.
- Overcooked vegetables: maybe they&#39;re playing it safe after Chipotle&#39;s e. Coli scare, but I wanted some crunch to the green beans, some firmness to the squash... maybe for the broccoli to still look kind of green instead of a yellow-brown? The vegetables left much to be desired, texture-wise especially.
- The flavors seemed oversimplified: tamarind sweet-tart, chili spicy, fish sauce salty (not so much umami). Very little complexity unless one opted for the mostly basil and cilantro herb salad as a topping at the end (highly recommended!!). The spring rolls were saltier than I&#39;m used to, but they were actually still quite tasty; more on those later.
- Nothing tasted good together: my mom, sister, and I tried various combinations of the jasmine (white) rice, brown rice, and salad bases with the green beans, squash, and corn. We stayed with the chicken and steak for our proteins, and we got the peanut sauce, tamarind vinaigrette, and spring roll dipping sauce on the side. All our different flavor experiments left horrendous tastes in our mouths. The red curry sounded too spicy for any of us to try, and for some reason we never got the side of green curry sauce we&#39;d requested (even though that one would likely have been too spicy for us to enjoy, too).

ShopHouse&#39;s strengths:
+ The customer service was spot-on, missing green curry sauce notwithstanding. Everyone was pleasant, thorough, and helpful when answering the many questions about all the new food offerings.
+ The spring rolls were pretty nice, especially compared to the rest of the meal. More like second cousins than authentic Vietnamese spring rolls, but they tasted alright and rescued our meal, pretty much. (Although I would NOT recommend trying to put the dipping sauce in one&#39;s protein/veggie bowl.)
+ The little coconut rice + mango parfaits were only $1.50, and their mellow flavor was a nice departure from the spicy charred sweet-tartness of the rest of the food. On the awful-to-amazing spectrum, it&#39;s skewed more toward &#34;meh,&#34; but I&#39;ll include it as a strength; at this point, ShopHouse needs as many positives as they can get.
+ The peanut sauce was relatively palatable. Again, not as tasty as authentic, but also not offensive. It would probably be my go-to sauce if ever I decided to venture into ShopHouse again. 
+ Not a surprise, but both the jasmine and brown rice varieties were nicely cooked and not gummy.
+ Also not a surprise, the baby kale + Napa cabbage salad was fresh and crunchy. Mixing it with the brown rice was A+ choice in one of our bowls.
+ The herb salad garnish option at the end of the bowl: 100% DELIGHTFUL. I wish they used more than glorified tweezers to add it, because I would have welcomed a large handful sprinkled across the top of my entire bowl.

In all, I would never, ever, ever desire ShopHouse over Chipotle or pretty much any other restaurant. Ever. In fact, I will likely never visit ShopHouse again unless I get my hands on another deal for a free bowl. Like Chipotle, ShopHouse isn&#39;t too authentic, but where Chipotle recognizes its lack of authenticity and makes up for it with good portions, fresh quality, and a well-rounded array of complex flavor and texture offerings, ShopHouse is measly and oversimplified and more of a one-note type of establishment. They have a lot of work to do if they want to achieve the dedicated fanbase Chipotle has amassed over the years."

The employees there were really nice and the place looked super clean and the employees were full of knowledge. I really like when places have items to offer to a variety of people&#39;s palettes. Everything I had in my bowl was well put together and the cold noodles were my favorite. It was definitely large enough to have leftovers the next day and my little guy loved everything. I would definitely come to this place if it was closer to Geneva/Batavia area.

I stood at the door trying to open it and the employees looked at me then looked away continuing to try and close. You cant have set daily hours if your employees dont want to stay open. I dont live close, So disappointing. I also never write bad reviews but working in the service industry myself, this pissed me off."

That is something that has been lacking many other places.  And the wall of Siracha is impressive.  But the mixes and matches of food when building a dish just don&#39;t always seem to work so well.  Ends up being a mish mash of stuff.  Their idea of a curry is a ladle of sauce that quickly gets absorbed into the mish mash.  Want more (you know, to make it a curry)?  That will be an extra charge.  Want broccoli in addition to the squash?  That will be an extra charge.   Maybe this place will get better.  Maybe they&#39;ll start worrying less about the cost of broccoli.  But if it doesn&#39;t improve I&#39;m not going to miss it when it&#39;s gone."

First the good:  Service was friendly.   I had the shophouse bowl which consists of rice, pork and chicken meatballs , charred corn, papaya slaw, fresh herbs, crispy garlic, and I added peanuts with green curry sauce.  Generally tasty ingredients but everything was only barely warm or cold.  There was not enough sauce for the portion of rice.  More veggies needed.  Three stars for this bowl because the meatballs are tasty.

The bad:  the tofu was inedible.  Dry and with a bad taste.  My son could not finish his bowl. 
One star for this dish.  Just bad.  

It would be nice to have another non-meat option such as shrimp.  As my son does not eat meat and the tofu was terrible, it looks like we won&#39;t be coming back."

Got the jasmine rice bowl with chicken Satay and peanut sauce, topped with papaya salad. Chicken Satay is quite authentic and I love the charred flavor, which reminds me of the good street food of Bangkok. Charred corn also tastes great. Papaya salad is decent and very fresh. You have to pair the sauce properly otherwise the food would taste weird. For example, in thailand, chicken Satay always go with peanut sauce. You don&#39;t mix curry sauce with chicken Satay because the flavors don&#39;t add up well. If you want to  curry sauce, get the meatball. If you go with the steak laab, go with the vinaigrette sauce, because the &#39;laab&#39; marinate is already an explosion of flavor, with majority sour. It would not go well with peanut sauce or curry sauce. Nice clean restaurant with open kitchen just like in Chipotle. For a fast food place, this is an amazing chain. Would recommend, but use your head when ordering!"

The young lady behind the counter who helped us order was very friendly and knowledgable. 

My husband and I left after hearing the manager express his political views to another customer who was seated a couple tables away from us. His smear campaign/debate with this customer was loud enough for us to hear (thanks for letting us know there&#39;s a Nazi in American politics) giving us an uncomfortable eating environment and enough reason to not want to come back.

I love Asian cuisine. When I heard this was coming to Schaumburg, I was very excited.
Love the concept. The food is good. The portions are probably less than most of us fattened American&#39;s are use to.  I welcome the change. I&#39;m a 200lb 35 year old grown man, and one regular bowl is enough to fill me up. This is a great lunch location. I&#39;ve noticed a difference in the amount of charring on the meat and veg. I think this is still being worked out.  When it is the right amount of char, it tastes very good.  Too much and the dish can taste burnt. Definitely try the meatballs. I prefer the red curry (wish they included more per serving). There might be a lack of salt to the dishes, but I think maybe we are all to use to overly salty foods. Soy sauce should be available.  I did not think to ask. I generally just top my bowl with Siracha and call it a day. The spring rolls are tasty but overpriced. Overall I like the uniqueness. I think there is room for improvement.  I think this is a better alternative to fast food. Most patrons should be able to find something they like. The service was friendly and inviting. Seems like they are constantly explaining how to choose your items even though it says it right on the menu above the counter. I find it humorous that customers constantly ask &#34;Is it spicy?&#34;, when there are flame icons to the right of the spicier items. What is spicy to you is not necessarily spicy to me. Give it a try. If it doesn&#39;t agree with you, so be it."

It&#39;s still pretty new, so the workers followed a flip book to make my order, but I won&#39;t hold that against them.

The food was not good. I ordered the Shophouse Bowl, assuming it would be the best indication of what this place had to offer. Other than the pork &amp; chicken meatballs (which was actually pretty freaking good), it was a combination of things I&#39;d like to forget. The flavor lacked depth and there was nothing really uniquely tasty about the bowl. Sriracha was a must to get through the meal.

The free BOGO card was a nice thought but not sure I&#39;ll be back."
