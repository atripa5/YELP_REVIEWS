I had my family over to meet our new born child at st. Alexian brothers down the street. I got my bag of food for the family and raced back to the hospital only to find out they forgot my wife&#39;s chicken pasta. Not wanting to step a foot in this restaurant agian, I had no choice but to go back so I called ahead to make sure it was ready.
I waited 15 min before being acknowledged. Another 10 for them to get the food.
Ladies and gentlemen of yelp, what&#39;s in a CHICKEN CAJUN PASTA?

1. The 2 slider meat was raw. Not edible. The fries that came with it had to much seasoning on it.
2. The pickle chips were disgusting. The batter was undercooked, mushy and had no taste. In the garbage they went.
3. The kids meal chicken was raw also. Extremely mushy. Did not take one bite. It was supposed to have loaded mash potatoes instead we go nothing.

$25 waste of money. I called to speak to a manager but was told they were all busy. Then my husband called to speak to a manager 3 minutes later and was told there were none on duty? Wth?

I want me money back. This place should be ashamed of itself."

Black bean burger and fries, yummmmm. I&#39;ve frequented this place less over the years, and I finally went a couple of days ago after receiving a gift card. We sat in the bar area, at a table that was definitely too small for the 4 chairs it had at it with all the other crap on the table. They do that pay at the little computer kiosk thing, which is in the way and so impersonal. More on that after the food. 
So I ordered some enchiladas that looked awesome, very Americanized, but I&#39;m into that. The chicken was severely over seasoned in them, which was a bummer. My lunch mates both had burgers, which looked good and were cooked to their liking. 
Our waitress was kind, always had a full drink for me. She had to wait on the entire bar area, which was filling up as we left, and she did so well. 
Okay so back to that stupid kiosk at table. You HAVE to pay at it, unless you&#39;re paying with cash. I get the idea for it. Saves time, etc. Still, I hate it. I don&#39;t want to push buttons on a touchscreen that some boogery two year old was playing with previously. Ick. 
I remember why I dine elsewhere. Chili&#39;s is okay, but for the same amount of money I can upgrade to good food."

We were super hungry so we ordered nachos, fried pickles, cheese curds, carnitas &amp; steak fajitas, &amp; buffalo chicken salad. 

The nachos weren&#39;t what I expected &amp; it didn&#39;t seem like there was any beef like it said on the menu, so I let one of the guys bringing us food know. I think he was the manager? He explained that there is a bit of beef in the queso, but if we didn&#39;t like it, he could bring us a new one. I told him that it wasn&#39;t what I expected &amp; he fixed it right away &amp; brought us a new one with ground beef in it. 

Still... everything was so salty!  I think most things were meant to be bar food tho so I kinda understand, but still. We weren&#39;t drinking so it was very salty. The fried pickles were salty, nachos were salty, cheese curds were salty, the Buffalo chicken on the salad was salty, the steak &amp; carnitas was salty. The fajitas were actually really good. It&#39;s something I always order when I come here. If it weren&#39;t salty, it would be even better! I also liked the cheese curds, except the powder sprinkled on top was salty... 

I drank 2 full mugs (cups?) of water &amp; ran out at the end of the meal. That&#39;s how salty everything was!

Other than that, the service here is great. Our server was really nice. I liked her. The manager that helped us out was great too.

Next time I&#39;m here, I&#39;ll def order something with less sodium. Plus there were a bunch of drinks I wanted to try on the menu so I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back. 

Also, be careful with that touch screen thing on the table. The person I was with tapped on a game out of boredom while we were waiting for our food, not knowing that there is a charge, didn&#39;t even play it, &amp; they charged $1.99. We didn&#39;t even play it! That made me so mad, even tho it was only $1.99. I didn&#39;t fight it. Just took it as a lesson learned."

When I tried to turn the pages of my menu, they were stuck together. After we placed our food order, I went to put the menus away. That&#39;s when my boyfriend moved the table lamp. I ewed and told him not to touch it because the lamp was dusty and dirty. We took turns going to the restroom and washing our hands. 

When I returned and sat down, my boyfriend got back up and asked the manager to come over to our table. He directed the manager&#39;s attention to the emergency backup lights located above us, to the lamp on our table and questioned him about the cleanliness of their kitchen. 

My boyfriend said that the amount of dust and debris that had been collected on things he could see and not ignore made him lose his appetite. 

We canceled our order and left. Please let me know when the restaurant is sanitized and we&#39;ll consider coming back again, thank you."

He forgot to bring us drinks but walked by us ten times and gave everyone else their drinks and never asked how we were doing. It was just awful and ruined the entire experience. I&#39;ve been in the restaurant business so I understand if it&#39;s busy or whatever but this was just plain rude.

Actually, we came at night for a late dinner around 9:30 pm. In the past, from experience of trial and errors, I&#39;ve learned that a restaurant&#39;s level of customer service &amp; good quality is a direct relation to how late  you arrive for dinner time. A lot of places seems to stop caring about how their food tastes and the wait staff seems to have mentally punched out by the time they your order when you come in for a super late dinner (after 9 pm). 

I was kind of shocked at how our experience at this place was actually very pleasant yesterday. My waiter was friendly when he took our order and never rushing us. And after we sat down, about 10 other people came in and filled about 4 other tables, by then it was well past 10pm. I felt like the place just got livelier on a Friday night, everybody is eating here!

Well, I can see why... The food was very good. I may depends on what you order but here is what we had and my ratings 1-5. We had the $20 deal for 2, where we share a half-sized appetizer and got 2 full sized entrees. As a bonus we also ordered 1 more appetizer.

1) Margarita Flatbread: 5! Must try app! See my photo which does it pretty good justice. It was warm with the right amount of flavor. I  actually wished I had more to chomp on after we were through. 

2) Chicken Fajita: 4! Soft and tender sliced pieces of chicken, the onions were very nicely caramelized and juicy. The salad toppings were fresh and it all made for a great meal. 

3) Boneless Chicken Tenders: 3. These were a bit spicy and salty for my taste, it was overwhelming the senses so I couldn&#39;t really taste the flavor of the chicken. It was semi tender, but I&#39;ve had better. 

4) Mango Chili Tilapia- 4. Very good, moist and full of chili favor. This is not for someone who can only eat mild, it is HOT spicy! It was great to eat with the rice pilaf and over all satisfying. 

Overall, I would recommend coming here for everything mentioned except for #3 which I felt was my least favorite. This place seems to open till late, so it&#39;s a perfect spot for a late dinner/snack. Two thumbs up!"

The 2 for $20.And Omg, It was so soft and tender topped off with cilantro! It was the best chicken I&#39;ve ever had! The onions were season to A1. I ate all of it! I will order this again!!! I like Chili&#39;s fajitas vs Uncle Julio&#39;s. I guess it depends on the dish you order. My first dish here was crappy but this second dish was delicious. I wasn&#39;t in the mood to eat out but when I bit that chicken it was heaven! Lets not forget about the onion too! They bring it out on a skillet still sizzling and hot just how I like it! Yummy yum yum.  I will definitely go back for this dish again soon! I&#39;m still dreaming of this dish. Ohh, let&#39;s not leave out the waiter . Damn, I didn&#39;t even look at his name tag because I was too busy stuffing my face when he came around a few times to ask how was we doing. I just remember he had the &#34;meatball&#34; tattoo from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on Adult Swim on his right upper arm towards the inner side. Anyways, he was on top of his waiting game when he came around and gave my kids their refill cups. No waiter ever refills my kids cup a 2nd time! If we ask they charge us extra but I guess Chili&#39;s don&#39;t charge extra for kids 2nd refill. The kids cups are so cute too. Overall,this time I enjoyed the service and food even though the waiter came back and told me they were out of the blue powerade I settled for orange Hi-C."

December 18th 1994. Completely Legal and had a valid ID. A group of us ordered a round of drinks and then our server asked for ID&#39;S. Went to hand her mine and completely got denied for my ID not being horizontal. REALLY? Asked for a manager and he shut me down right away &amp; was very rude about it. My boyfriend ordered another drink for me anyway, I mean what are they going to do, arrest me for being legal? And not to mention I was the only minority in the group so how does that make me feel? This Chili&#39;s is RACIST. Secondly, we order the queso which was honestly disgusting. Very soupy and just was not how it usually is. The manager even said &#34;we got a bad batch&#34; SO YOU&#39;RE GOING TO SERVE A BAD BATCH OF QUESO TO CUSTOMERS ANYWAY? We had them take the queso back and to not put it on the bill.

When we first arrived, we asked the hostess for a high chair. After being seated, the hostess asked if we wanted a sling and again we had to request a high chair. We were seated close to the To Go entrance, therefore getting a cold draft every time the door opened. Wasn&#39;t very happy with that since our child was basically seated in line with that door, getting most of the cold draft. The server took a long time to arrive at our table so we just decided to order all at once after she finally arrived. After getting through the appetizer, we probably waited about 30 minutes for our entrées to arrive. I asked her for 3 waters and we only got 2. My husband had to ask her for a refill on his drink twice before getting it. I had the ribs and salmon combo and it was horrible, I barely ate it. The ribs weren&#39;t grilled, like they usually are. It seemed fried with BBQ sauce on top. The salmon was overcooked and just had a bad flavor. My cocktail was watered down. We ended up checking out at our table since our server never came back to check on us or gave us our check. The table next to us complained about their food being dry and the same server not introducing herself. As we were walking out, our server walked by us and didn&#39;t even thank us or say a word for that matter. There wasn&#39;t a hostess at the front, nor were there any other employees our front as we were leaving.

On three occasions, separated by months, I have ordered food for pick-up from the Chilis To-Go service. On every occasion I have had to wait about 10 minutes for my food to be ready even when arriving at the designated pickup time and even when extending that pickup time via the website by 10 or 15 minutes. No line for pickup mind you. This is me just waiting in the restaurant for my order to be ready.

Most recently, I ordered lunch to go on a weekday and had to wait the 10 minutes. Furthermore, my order was incorrect having received the wrong meat selection for my fajitas. Now, it is possible that they were out of my particular choice, but I was never notified of the change.

If you order to-go from this location. Be ready to wait for your food or show up a few minutes later than the scheduled pickup time. Additionally, check all the food items and containers at the counter before you leave to make sure your order is correct."

My husband saw a commercial on TV and wanted Chilis.  I wanted....pretty much anything else.

Since I get my way (food-wise!) about 90% of the time, I figured I could go along with his suggestion this once.  We did the 2/$20 meal that includes a shared appetizer and two entrees off of the special menu.  We did the 1/2 order of Texas Cheese Fries (melted cheese, bacon, jalapenos w/ ranch sauce for dipping) as our app.  For our meal, he chose the taco pizza (new on the menu) and I chose the 6oz sirloin w/ mac n cheese instead of the mashed potatoes.  I asked for it well-done.

They made it REALLY well done.  As in charred...as in almost inedible because it was SO chewy.  I uploaded a picture of it so you could really see how black it was.  The loaded mac n cheese was REALLY good though.  It is a good solid macaroni and cheese base to start with, and then they top it with melted cheese and breadcrumbs.  There are also jalapenos in the mix, and my husband really enjoyed that.  The Taco Pizza was really good.  It had a nice crust (not a wibbly crust) and held onto the ingredients well.  The cheese fries were delicious, but congealed by the time we got home.  Understandable, however, because that&#39;s just a property of the cheese.

The staff was polite when placing my order, and it was a cheap (ish) to-go meal.  I wouldn&#39;t say I am in any rush to go back, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t kick and scream if my husband got another hankering!"

Also the look of servers has gone down the drain too ( untucked shirts and not clean cut) No issues with our server but the appearence of others was kinda a turn off.

The salmon was dry and did not want to let our server know cause we did not see him until the salmon was finished and we were starving. The enchiladas were great! The short rib melted in my mouth and was tasty! The chicken had great taste and seasoning. The salad was good with the grilled cheese! The best was the toffee fudge brownie! It is the best dessert served warm on the skillet! It melted in my mouth with the warm chocolate taste burst with the vanilla ice cream. Great combination and taste for dessert! We even ordered our dessert before the waiter came by to ask us cause we waited so long we ordered on the tablet that was on the table. It is great to see the food on that device before you order! We even paid our bill on the tablet with our credit card cause we waited so long for our waiter and wanted to leave after the good dessert!

Started with, of course, the queso which was good as always, though had to be stirred to be uniformly hot (first hint).  My drink &#34;glass&#34; was cloudy and after a couple of sips I noticed something black on the inside top of the glass, I think it was a piece of olive.  The waitress looked at the glass and said &#34;ewwww&#34;... never apologized though.

On to the main course, my wife had the shrimp tacos.  She said they were good.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, cooked medium.  It came well done and when I finally got the attention of the waitress she took it back but no apology.  Second burger comes, I take a bite and the first bite was medium well, close enough I was hungry.  I kept eating, bite after bite the burger was more and more done until I hit the center, well done, overly well done.  Now what cooking method would make a burger cook from the inside out?  Oh yea, microwave.  BURGERS, MICROWAVED!  That is a first for me, and a last.

Kids had lot of choices too. We liked the ambience too. Food didn&#39;t taste like reheated and stale and decent wait time post ordering."

He took my drink order, then vanished.  10 mins for the diet coke to arrive, delivered by someone other than my waiter.  Ok.  10 more mins and the original waiter is back. Ordered side salad and wings over buffalo.  Looking around while I am waiting.  Not only is there a fowl odor, it looks as if no one has scrubbed the floor or seats, ever.  Dank.  Food arrives.  Side salad is good, nice balance of lettuce and carrots, etc.  Good ranch dressing.  But, the wings. One bite into a drumstick and there is more FAT than meat.  HUH, never had wings full of fat.  Maybe it&#39;s a bad one?  Nope, tried all of the wings and they are the same. Gross.  Stomach has been upset since lunch.  There are many other choices in the area.  IHOP seems like a good choice.

Chilis at barrington and Higgins rd is the worst chain restaurant there is. I went there with my wife last Friday night. Arrived at 8.45pm, waited for 20mins to be seated, was sat at an open table that was open the entire time we waited. Chair was not cleaned - had to clean it myself. Waitress watched me do it. We ordered $5 margaritas, cups were grossly uneven. Power went out and we were told by our loud unsympathetic waitress that they were shutting the kitchen down and she was getting our checks. By the way we hadn&#39;t gotten the entree we ordered. It was 9.30 at this point. Power was out 2mins into the announcement and the kicking out. Wife and I complained to the mgr - he apologized and didn&#39;t charge us drinks but said generator didn&#39;t work. As we got up to leave power returned (duration wasn&#39;t more than 5mins). We had to scramble and find dinner elsewhere.

In addition to the meals, we also ordered their bottomless tostada chips. It was a good thing we ordered those bottomless chips, as we ended up having to wait a bit for both of our appetizers to arrive. During this time, it became apparent that there had been some type communication issue(s) going on in the kitchen. We didn&#39;t think much of it, until our waitress&#39; demeanor visibly changed after a few trips back and forth to the kitchen. Even more surprisingly, the manager onsite that night came to our table to specifically apologize about the wait. He seemed genuinely concerned and ended up comping the two appetizers.

Tells us they are making fresh fries in the back. What?  so the one fry we got was old? How do you serve the meal without the fries after 20 minutes? Sure she says she is sorry but after that even it was not her fault, a manager should have comped us something for the huge delay and error.

The atmosphere is casual, but a good spot nonetheless to have a nice dinner.

We ordered the following:
Seaweed salad: very drenched and marinated
Big fish tuna? Roll: I think this was the name, and I loved this roll! Very fresh and tasty
Mongolian beef: not too saucy, so it was perfect
Pad Thai: one of the better dishes
Pad see ew: probably the least favorite, kind of drenched
Tom yum soup: a crowd favorite, though I thought it was too salty
Shrimp and vegetable dish: yummy and slightly healthy in a nice garlic sauce 
Green curry dish: this was also very tasty and filled with many delicious ingredients

Pad thai is a barometer dish for me, it&#39;s easy to churn out a mediocre product, a gelatinous glob of sickly sweet noodles. You know the stuff, usually with a pink hue. It&#39;s a challenge to make a flavorful dish that is pleasure to eat. You can hide a lack of artfulness in an over spiced curry or sickly soup, but humble pad thai is a nuts and bolts dish.

I found a Thai place here in Chicagoland that has decent Tom Yum soup! I actually wish it could be a little more lemongrass-y and spicy...but all the other Tom Yum soups I&#39;ve had here are either too much on the sweet side, coconut side, or just plain bland. I heard that if you come for lunch, it&#39;s included in your lunch special. Score! Too bad I don&#39;t live close enough to take advantage of the lunch specials during the week, so ordering a bowl of it for dinner will more than suffice.

Our table also ordered the nabiyaki udon (my fav out of all the dishes we ordered), pad see yew plus bean sprouts (love the crunch), and red curry. 

The nabiyaki udon comes with a delicious thick broth with two pieces of tempura shrimp (never disappointed with a freshly fried tempura shrimp) and eggs. This hot dish is perfect for a chilly day. Try to finish it in one sitting though -- soggy udon noodles at home are definitely not as good as fresh, chewy ones at the restaurant.

The pad see yew was pretty standard...it wasn&#39;t completely out of this world, but it was good and definitely hit the spot for my Thai noodle cravings. And then finally, the red curry had lots of veggies like eggplant, peas, string beans, and bamboo shoots (one of my favs). Pour over rice, mix and enjoy! Overall such a great meal with lots of variety for a delicious taste of Thailand (and a little bit of Japan with the udon)."

- Food quality has deteriorated over the years.  VERY GREASY!  I used to go here a lot but have only gone 2x to 3x per year for the past 4 years and indeed, food has become super greasy (see photos).
- They offer sushi but quality is not so good.  Tried it 3x before but stopped.  Also, another Yelper is correct.  I often see their sushi chef smoking outside.  Not too appetizing to know your chef is smoking and then handling your food after.  Not a big fan.

I also enjoy their tempura udon soup. Both the Thai and Japanese dishes are equally delicious. The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because there have been two times when I have ordered the yellow curry with tofu &#34;to go&#34;, and there were several pieces of chicken mixed into the dish. As a vegetarian, I was very put off by this and had to throw the whole dish away. I guess it speaks highly their food because I keep coming back in spite of these 2 disappointing past occurrences.

I had the Pad Thai and it was actually very good, coming in only second after my first favorite (which has held this place for years and hasn&#39;t had any contenders come even close).

I was in the neighborhood looking for apartments and knew I Gumrai Thai was on the corner of Arlington Heights Rd &amp; Northwest Hwy as I&#39;ve passed it a million billion times. I&#39;m soooo glad I stopped in because it&#39;s the best, non-expensive place I&#39;ve had in quite some time!

Pop is $2 with unlimited refills, yay to not gouging on the drink prices. I saw many bottles of wine around the $20 price point as well, so not a bad place for some vino as well.

My friend and I started with the Sweet Potato Maki. We tried to order the shitake mushroom roll for $3 but they were out of the little fun guys (fungi, get it?! Sorry I saw it on a shirt and have been dying to use it since). I&#39;m so glad they were out of shitakes because it forced us to get the amazingness that is the Sweet Potato Maki ($6). It&#39;s a white girl&#39;s dream roll with avocado, sweet potato, cream cheese, japanese mayo and a couple other sauces....OooOooo yeah. It was seriously savory and I&#39;m going to be getting that for pickup often!

I had Pad Thai as my entree which is my dish on which I rate all Thai restaurants. Oh. My. Jeebus. It was some seriously choice pad thai. It was a bit greasy but I think that really added to it, honestly. $9 for a humungous portion that&#39;s going to do me well tomorrow night for dinner. 

Service was great, she checked up on us, knew we couldn&#39;t finish the HUGE portions and brought us boxes, and all the waitresses were so pretty here!"

Although flavor-wise I haven&#39;t had anything that is like &#39;MUST COME BACK AND EAT AGAIN AND AGAIN!!&#39;, there are pretty good Asian staples (pad thai, stir frys, etc).  The service is quick and very friendly.  They also have really good lunch specials (even on the weekends! or at least even on Saturdays, I&#39;ve not been on a Sunday) - entrees between 7-12 bucks that comes with an appetizer and a little bowl of soup.  The noodle dishes seem especially generous in portion."

Daaamn they got some big ass portions here! Thanks to Gumrai Thai, I&#39;m currently on the verge of having an outie navel and don&#39;t know whether to call a piercer or a mohel. Too far? You&#39;re telling me.

Every time I come here I order a baby elephant&#39;s worth of food and my server tries to walk away while I&#39;m only about half way through my list of goodies... then she apologizes thinking I&#39;m embarrassed (I&#39;m not, but my BF is) and says &#39;no worry, you order more, it better for me&#39;. So while I&#39;ll be paying off my student loans for the next 800 years, there&#39;s some very happy Thai child out there with a full ride on my bottomless appetite for spicy basil tofu. You&#39;re welcome. 

Now, I&#39;m sure everything is good, but I can only recommend from my own experiences, so here&#39;s my usual Gumrai order:

1.) Shiitake Maki 
2.) Avocado Roll
3.) Sweet Potato Maki (GET THIS! GET THIS! GET THIS!)
4.) Tom Yum Soup w/ Tofu (the small is a huge portion and under $4)
5.) Spicy Basil w/ Tofu... extra spicy, natch
...and for the BF (trying to keep his girlish figure, obvi)
6.) Pad See Ew w/ Tofu

Not eating for 3 like me? No bigs! Gumrai is great bc they skimp on the juicy goodness with each dish so if you take your leftovers home and give it a chance to sit and marinate, don&#39;t be shocked if it tastes even better a day or two later. 

Last note/warning: Some of their plates are really cool looking, but not-so-great when trying to pack up your leftovers into a container because they&#39;re heavy and all sorts of odd shapes and it will literally take a village to pout anything off of the spicy basil dish into a box without spillage. The next time I go I&#39;ve already decided to for-go the take-out container all together and just store the fooders in my cheeks until I&#39;m hungry again (usually about 13 minutes later). 

GuMmmrai Goodness, fo sho."

I have ordered some take out sushi from here in the past and had a great experience so I was excited to come back here.

My dining partner and I arrived 7 pm on a Saturday night and were seated immediately.  Unfortunately it was by a big window and it was really cold.  Get some curtains for that! 

I don&#39;t have much experience in the world of Thai food so I never really know what to order.  We started off with a sweet potato maki app because so many had recommended it and I was impressed.  I didn&#39;t know how they were going to make a roll out of something squishy like sweet potato, but they did and it was great.   For my entree,  I ended up ordering the Pad Se-ew with chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Spicy Basil with pork.  I guess I&#39;ve never had rice noodles before and I would say they have an interesting texture, but I really liked the flavor overall and would order this dish again.  Actually, when I go back I think I&#39;ll order the spicy basil because I had a few bites of the bf&#39;s and it was dynamite. I could have done without the pork though but that&#39;s just personal preference. The portions were large and we both ended up taking leftovers home.  

It was just as good the next day.

The service we had was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular and I can understand why others think it is sub-par.  Instead of just having one server, ours switched back and forth so maybe sometimes they forget about people."

The prices are good, the food is made quickly, and the restaurant is a nice quiet little place which is perfect for a more laid back night. My favorite thing to get is the green curry, but I also love the peanut sauce delight and the sweet and sour (which isn&#39;t breaded, which makes it even better). The wait staff is really friendly and the place is never overcrowded."

But if you&#39;re in this area and get that pho craving, it&#39;ll do the job. They didn&#39;t, to my dismay and surprise, include any tubs of Sriracha and hoisin in my takeout package.

2) Tom Yum Noodles soup is very tasty. But there&#39;s not enough broth and too many noodles. The result is that, while I usually get 2 full bowls out of a typical pho order, I only got one bowl out of this, for the same price."

The location of the restaurant is a little confusing.  It is on a corner (plus), but is dark and has traditional strip mall signage (minus).  

But, we walked in and were greeted immediately, although the hostess was busy seating other tables.  The table service was good.  The crab rangoon was huge and there were six of them (great for the price).  I ordered chicken pad thai (boring, but I am an expert and they did a nice job-- very peanut buttery sauce) and my fiancé ordered a red curry (which he loved).

I would recommend this to anyone.  Good prices, good service and good food.  The only reason they did not get five stars is because I do not know how consistent they are.  I will follow up."
gumrai-thai-arlington-heights,Victoria H.,cRt0608EYB1iuKxbTg8h0A,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1,571,51,JTkgKiyFiW4IAxDkUMWrLg,2.0,2013-06-09,"Living in Arlington Heights, we have dined at and ordered out from Gumrai Thai pretty regularly.  That is all in the past now.  Here I had a nice 4 star review drafted out, but our last few visits have me teetering on a 2-3 star review, having left a bad taste in our mouths...literally.

Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve liked Gumrai in the past so I know there is some good to it.  The portions are large.  When we order the Thai entrees, we end up taking about half home, but bigger is not always better.  I prefer quality over quantity.  I love getting some spicy Tom Yum soup with tofu.  A nice kick with big thick chunks of tofu and mushrooms.  The Tom Ka (made with coconut milk) with tofu is also one of my favorite starters.  The Thai Iced Coffee and Tea are both creamily delicious.  And the Sweet Potato Maki is definitely worth adding to your order.

They have sushi!  Well don&#39;t get too excited because I don&#39;t recommend much of it.  When I have ordered the Sashimi AP in the past, I swear the yellowtail is frozen in the center.  This last visit, ALL the sashimi I ordered (aside for the scallop) tasted as if they had been defrosted.  Not fresh at all.  I mean it&#39;s a Thai place, so maybe I should stick to a Thai specialty dish, but they have a sushi menu and I try to pick healthier options from time to time, in addition to being a sushi freak.  But previously frozen sushi?  No thank you.

The service can be hit or miss.  A couple of the younger girls are on top of their business and make for a good experience.  The ambiance is a little sharp and cold to me.  I think they need to warm the place up a bit somehow, making it more comfortable and inviting, with seating and decor.

During our last visit (tonight), our bill was dropped off while we were still eating, prior to close, which is fine, but then one of the waitresses walked over and asked for payment and for us to sign our receipt so that they could close it out.  Normally this wouldn&#39;t really bother me too much, but I was in the middle of attempting to eat my defrosted sashimi and my boyfriend was attempting to chew through his tough meat.  He had also modified his meal a bit and the message was obviously not communicated to the kitchen.  I could understand if they were closed already and we were just taking our sweet time, but that wasn&#39;t the case.  I guess they just wanted everything closed out before actually closing.

All good things come to an end.  Gumrai Thai has gone down hill and I think it&#39;s time we finally part ways.  There are plenty of other fish in the sea...or Thai restaurants in the area.   It&#39;s not me, it&#39;s you.  Sorry Gumrai."

The food used to be good and the service was pretty decent in the past.  Over the years, the food is getting extremely greasy.  The waitress does not smile, and the ambient is very dull for these days.  I ordered fried rice and noodle dish yesterday.  I have asked my waitress not to use too much oil for the fried rice ahead of time.  However, the fried rice was very greasy.  It was almost not edible and gross.  My noodles were all stuck together as one ball of dough.  I have politely complained about my dish to the waitress, but she just went inside of the kitchen after my complaints.  I patiently waited for somebody to come up to my table, but nobody seemed to care my table after my complaints.  The waitress with a stone face left a bill with full charge prices on my table, and she did not even comment on what I had to say... (Of course she did not even apologize).  I would think the restaurant wants to hear what customers want to say at least... but that was never the case at Gumrai.  I live in Arlington Heights and love Thai food, but Gumrai is no longer in my list.  In fact I don&#39;t consider their food is Thai food anymore.   This is the first yelp posting for me.  I have full respect for the food business people and want to support their businesses.

I still think this place is really good for the price at lunch but does get pretty busy and has limited parking. The Nabeyaki Udon, Ramen, and Tempura Bento Box are great while the Lad Nar and Pad Woonsen are solid choices.

Sometimes I think that this place could get a 24 on the Zagat guide but other times maybe a 17. If they could be more consistent in their delivery they&#39;d easily be one of the best choices in Asian restaurants in the area.

And it would be easy to do, too, because the portions are pretty magnanimous. Pair those giant portions with a cornucopia of sushi, Thai and Asian inspired dishes and I&#39;m set. That is until I have to wear pants with an actual zip fly. But that&#39;s neither here nor there.

I vacillated between a 3 and 4 star rating for Gumrai as some dishes are total standouts while others really fell short. So allow me to give you the short and sweet of what I sampled...

Sweet potato maki roll: 5/5: Totally delicious, unexpected and filling. It&#39;s also a total steal! 

Pad Thai: 2.5/5: Their pad thai&#39;s noodles are quite saturated in sauce, thus killing the appeal for me. Flavor was a bit mundane as were the overcooked, wet noodles that accompanied the bits of chicken. But again, it&#39;s worth noting that the portion was extra large.

Satay: 4/5: Standard satay with a solid peanut sauce. Nothing out of the ordinary here, but tasty nonetheless.

Asparagus roll: 2/5: This item had such potential on the menu but I was completely turned off by the the gelatinous beef product under and over the tightly wrapped rolls. 

Service was speedy and attentive and I hear they delivery too! I&#39;ll definitely give Gumrai another try but likely just stay away from a few meh dishes that I tried. I have a feeling I could very easily bump this up to a 4 star rating with just another meal."

I want to keep going to new places until I&#39;ve tried them all! 

Gumrai stands out with the size of its menu, the traditional Thai selections, and a very Thai atmosphere. I had the Thai tea which tasted smokey (is that supposed to be like that? I liked it well enough), penang curry (very very tasty, not very spicy b/c I wanted mild), and for dessert, taro sticky rice (came wrapped in leaves and was chewy and warm and yummy. :) Eat all the dessert right away, because it doesn&#39;t taste as good after a night in the fridge!

I&#39;ve been driving by this place for an eternity and have kept thinking that I have to check it out. Well, I finally did a half an hour before they closed on a Thursday and what a pleasant surprise.

There was a $3 tekka maki special so I opted for one as my appetizer. I&#39;m always skeptical of Asian restaurants that try to be all things Asian and Gumrai is one of them - Japanese, Thai and Chinese offerings. Too often these places are jack of all trades and masters of none, but Gumrai scored with me on the sushi. Freshly made and nicely done - thumbs up.

For dinner I opted for my favorite Thai standby - Chicken Pad Thai, medium spicy. It was spot on and what a huge order. Diet Pepsi kept full frequently by my waitress - total bill with tax was $15.40. Good food, good price, good service. Just kicking myself for not having tried it earlier."

The cucumbers were also no crunchy, basically I find the sushi in Mariano&#39;s way better and the only reason I tried it is I live walking distance from here and wanted a quick lunch. Not worth the $11 something for a lunch maki combo! I have been eating sushi for ten years fairly frequently and I have to say this is one of the worst! Awful!!"

Being a hard core thai food lover, I found this place to be pretty average. The pad thai noodles on both occasions seemed to be a tad on the WIDE side, I prefer the thin rice noodles, but then again, that&#39;s just preference, plus the sauce that they make their pad thai in, isn&#39;t the typical one that I prefer, but it&#39;s still not bad. The egg rolls, crab ragoons, their fried rice is all very mediocre, nothing stands out horribly, nor is anything outstanding. 

What&#39;s good is that there servings are HUGEEE, even dining in, you can easily share a portion with someone. They are pretty nice as well, making it a pleasant dining experience. So overall, would I come back here knowing alt thai (my fave AH&#39;s spot) is just down the street? Probably not. But if a friend wanted to carry out some decent thai food for another event, would I suggest this place? Why not! Gumrai, up your food game a lil and I&#39;ll be all over that!"

Erratic, slow, poor service, food ok but not special in flavor, quantity or quality imo.

I dine solo a lot at lunch because first I really enjoy it, AND my partner&#39;s schedule and when we can have lunch together she isn&#39;t as big a fan of Asian spicy as I am. One thing I couldn&#39;t help noticing here was the solo diner gets the special worst service in the room, always the newest server, rarely the more experienced servers. I had to get up on more than one occasion to ask for a refill of their better than average green tea and if you pay attention, it is just obvious that they do not respect the solo diner.  I usually eat at 1:30 or later and Gumrai Thai is not paying much attention to customer service after 1:30 imo, not sure what they are doing but they are doing it until 3pm.

The sushi chef is not always there so be prepared with another option, I just left once. I enjoyed decent Chirashi a couple times and also one of the poorest Unagi appetizers I have ever had compounded by drizzling too much soy/balsamic over it? I could barely find the sad thin eel that was in there, I had to search through a horrible brown sauce, maybe that was the plan. Recently went with the Tom Yum soup, but the new server neglected to tell me that my appetizer soup was ALSO a Tom Yum soup but without the noodles. Oddly enuf there was more chicken in the appetizer bowl than the lunch bowl. I think they think the addition of a handful of cheap cold raw white stemmed raw button mushrooms floating in the larger bowl lets them take chicken out, way below average. Tasty egg roll and CrabRangoon though, and the Tom Yum broth was good.

If you go I hope you have better luck, maybe we&#39;ll try dinner someday when I get the taste of that eel maki and raw button mushrooms out of my memory, unlikely, as that must support these better reviews. My advice is you can do better.
If caught here when the sushi chef is gone or it&#39;s 1:30, do not go to Wildfish, go to Sun Shui in Arlington Heights if you want a reasonable sushi option, or better yet for Thai to Thai Little Home Cafe in Arlington Heights or head for Sir Thai in Palatine or Lake Zurich. TTOWA in town is solid for Korean.

Tom Yum Noodle Soup with chicken and no mushrooms and a Pepsi.
I&#39;m a Coke girl, but this is the only place I&#39;ll make an exception.
I&#39;m the type of person that gets the same thing every time I go to a restaurant but I have tried my brother&#39;s Beef Teriyaki and I love it. You also get an appetizer if you order the lunch special that includes a mini bowl of Tom Yum soup, a crab rangoon, an eggroll and THE BEST dipping sauce. On Fridays &amp; Sundays, the eggroll and rangoon are replaced by chicken satay with peanut sauce and cucumber salad, which is equally as good.

Everyone is SO sweet, it&#39;s super cute, rarely crowded and reeeaaallllllyyyy cheap. Worth driving to the suburbs if you&#39;re a city-dweller like I was the last few years I lived in Chicago. My brother, best friend and I are regulars."

We recently ordered from there, went to pick up the food and when we got home, realized one of the meals was missing. Since Gumrai is about 20 minutes from our house, we did not want to go back and pick it up as the other food would be cold by then. I called to ask if they would give us our money back for the meal they forgot to include- they refused to do so and were VERY rude over the phone. They basically would not help us and said our only option would be to come in and pick up the meal. I was very disappointed with their customer service.

It could have done with out the giant chunks of tomato and jalapeno though. I wish they had diced them instead. The dish was very tasty and the portion was fairly large. 

For an appetizer, I had the Tom Yum soup (the one made with coconut milk) and it was awesome. My only issue with it was again the pieces of chicken were too big. Also, I felt the soup had too many mushrooms. Again, the small soup was also fairly large for one person."

The stir fry dishes can be very oily, and the dishes from the kitchen often come out inconsistent.   

A Pad Thai I ordered not too long ago was served to me with black edged burnt noodles, and overall it was still very oily.  It was so obviously not at an acceptable enough level of quality to serve, that I am really disappointed by whoever cooked that day, as they made a lousy dish, and they were very inconsiderate and clueless to serve it to me as a customer.

The service can be very nice, but later in the shifts or when it gets busy, attention on the customers slows down quite a bit.   Therefore, you never know what to expect.

It is not a terrible restaurant, but maybe below average at best.    I think other Yelp reviewers are far too generous to this place, and I wanted to also add my voice."

We were all glad that there were other families as well.  There is plenty of parking at night but getting in there after crossing the RR tracks can be a little difficult.  My friends noticed that there weren&#39;t changing tables in the bathrooms.

My friends ordered udon for their kids and it was a large portion.  We started off with papaya salad and tempura.  The salad was spicy and had a good flavor from the fruit, vegetables, and shrimp.  Tempura was lightly battered and was not overfried.  The main dishes were the chicken basil fried rice and shrimp pad kee mao.  Both were spicy and we finished everything off without leftovers.  The noodles looked like they were overdone.  Value of the meal was pretty good.  Definitely a good Thai restaurant in the area!"

Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with being soft.  I like lots of soft things.  I like pillows.  I like bunny rabbits.  I like the warm grass of a park felt against my back on a beautiful spring day.  Guh.  Now I&#39;m feeling soft even writing this back in the city.  That aside, I feel the need to add one more thing to the list of soft things I love: the (spicy) basil fried rice at Gumrai Thai.

Every bite of the entree that I got at the NW Suburban Thai Dinner here was easy on the teeth and gums.  There was no hard work involved in digestion either.  And, I thought it might have just been the fresh air I felt while walking a block or so from the Arlington Heights Metra stop that brought out the flavors, but trying out the leftovers from the large portions at home in the polluted city (on an Ikea plate so maybe I am suburban at heart), I still tasted every vegetable.  Every soft carrot.  Every soft baby corn.  Every soft bok choi.  And, even on accident once, every soft satan&#39;s fungus (aka mushroom).  Some might call these overdone but I call them wonderful.

Another thing that might make this place too easy is that nearly everything on the menu can be made vegetarian.  It has been ages since I got a veggie hot-and-sour soup (again with soft, soft vegetables).  It was Goldilocks spicy as well - not too hot, not too mild.  Plus the prices don&#39;t hit hard either.  $7 entrees?  Sign me up.

If it didn&#39;t cost $9 round trip for me to get here on the Metra, I would go here all the time.  Oh, those fares.  My life is so hard!  Thankfully every so often I get to enjoy something soft like this."

Location is great, downtown Arlington Heights- and easy to find. Decor was quite pleasing and restaurant was very clean. The prices seemed in line with other Thai restaurants I have visited. 

We started with the Tom Yum soup (the small was enough for two of us to try and share). It was wonderful, hot and lots of chicken and mushrooms. I ordered the Larb Gai (chicken salad). I was surprised to see that there were no additional lettuce leaves, as I have had this dish before and it is served with several lettuce leaves so you could wrap your chicken salad in them. The consistency was good, way too much lime in the dressing and very few peppers and onions. My partner had the Pad Kee Moo (sp) which is made with jalapenos and neither of us thought that it was too spicy--an opinion not shared by the table next to us that had to reorder their entrees because they said they couldn&#39;t eat theirs because it was too spicy. Really people?? Really--the name of the dish had SPICY in it!! Nevertheless, the waitress was very polite and brought another entree to their table. 

So if you do go--read the descriptions SPICY means SPICY. Other than that I found the tastes to be exactly what they said."

Was suppose to have dried chili in it but it had little taste other than somewhat sweet. My chicken with vegetables in garlic sauce was not great either.  Chicken was tough and chewy.

The Pad See Ew noodles was cooked so long in oil that the dish turned into paste. We used a spoon to eat as much as we could before giving up. The fried rice was hardly warm with the beef tasting like rubber. Even worse, there was so much salt that all I could eat was about 3 bites. When I complained and asked to speak with the manager, the lying waitress said that he was not there (by the way- he&#39;s the grey hair Thai guy that always by the Sushi area). The owner/manager was the greeter when we came in and remained behind the bar the whole time we were in the restaurant. When he noticed that we were complaining to the waitress about the food, he made a quick exit into the kitchen. This restaurant had potential years ago, but now with the waitresses that are always on their phones, the extra greasy food, and a coward owner- I&#39;m hopeful that it won&#39;t be around much longer.

The interior of the restaurant is much bigger than what appears on the outside. The reddish-orange details of the decor and lighting give it a touch of elegance.

We had a long table and a waitress who gave us plenty of space, rather than pushing us to order. I chose a Thai style sweet iced tea and a small bowl of soup with whole mushrooms in it. As a main course, I had the sweet and sour chicken. It was better than any Chinese sweet and sour counterpart I ever had. For one, the chicken was not drowned in sauce. The flavor came from the well-defined taste of the pineapple contrasting the flavor of the sauce for a delicious combination.

I also got to try another Yelper&#39;s catfish pudped. My conclusion: It doesn&#39;t taste anything like catfish. None of the fishiness at all! It would have been an excellent choice too.

In short, their menu is pretty diverse, ranging from sushi to Chinese and Vietnamese, but their delivery on the dish is as solid as it gets."

Great deal for their lunch specials!! Last time I went for dinner, and the price was reasonable for their portion size. I think I&#39;m a bigger fan of their lunch specials! Read below.

LUNCH SPECIAL: My goodness!! Their lunch special is pretty awesome. I was impressed. The lunch special today came with soup (the clear Thai soup, not coconut soup), chicken satay (2) and peanut sauce, and pickled cucumbers. If you ordered a non-noodle dish, the lunch special also came with white or fried rice. If you ordered a noodle dish, no rice for you! Wow! I don&#39;t want to quote the price I paid for this special today (just because I&#39;m not positive and I do not want to mislead you guys!), but believe me - great deal!!! 

AMBIANCE: Their ambiance is nice. It could definitely be a date place. Very clean. Nicely decorated. 

SERVICE: Okay, their service is really not that great. Last time we went, service was no good and there was only 2 of us. Today, I went with a large group, and it still was not any good. So, if you&#39;re looking to have somebody at your beck and call, this is not the restaurant to go to. The waitress today didn&#39;t seem like a very happy person, either. Just a warning! 

FOOD: Last time, their pad thai was too sweet, so I was not ordering that again. Today, I choose to have their Pad See U with beef! I enjoyed their pad see u. It was flavored fine (also a little sweet, but not as sweet as their pad thai). Their broccoli was cooked perfectly - not too hard and not too soft. Their beef tasted like beef - nothing fancy. Actually, if I had to guess, it would have been a lesser grade of beef, but I&#39;m no connoisseur of beef, so I have no idea. But... it tasted &#34;beefy&#34;. Whatever - you can go and tell me whether you agree if you choose to order their beef!!! Oh yeah, I ordered the &#34;golden bags&#34; again this time and told the rest of the party about it. They were not disappointed! I recommend this, if you are not allergic to imitation crab meat and shrimp.

All of their ingredients are fresh and I always feel like when I go there, that I have had the taste of Authentic Thai Food that is not commercialized.  Much better than the competitor, Alt Thai, across the tracks, if you ask me!

Highly recommend to all!"

The waitresses seemed a little out of it, but were polite enough.  The appetizer soup was alright, and the chicken satay was pretty tasteless without the peanut sauce. The egg roll was scrumptious and the cheese puff was delicious. 

For my main entree, I asked for medium spicy pad kee mao. It came out pretty sweet actually, with the chili all clumped in the middle making my bites from this part of the plate a bit hot.

All in all,  I&#39;ve had better and cheaper Thai food, but I would go back whenever I&#39;m in Arlington Heights."

The prices are reasonable, the portions are huge and the taste is always delicious.

The red curry is chock full of delicious vegetables, has a nice thick and creamy consistency (which I feel is important for all curries!) and has the right amount of spiciness.  The pad thai, which has become my favorite, is the best pad thai I&#39;ve had in quite a long time.  It has just the right amount of saltiness AND sweetness.  I also love that they sprinkle crushed up peanuts over the top; gives it some nice crunch!  One set back would be how they chop up the green onions.  They&#39;re in huge, and I mean HUGE, slices/chunks.  If you&#39;re a fan of green onions, then more power to you, but I prefer them to be chopped up into smaller pieces.

I still love Gumrai and though it is completely out of my way to order from, I love their food too much to try to elsewhere!"

The sushi guy literally picked up his cell phone and turned his back -- a &#34;we&#39;ll be right with you&#34; would have been great. Add this to confusion when paying the bill and an overall unwelcoming vibe -- not a good way to start an experience with a restaurant. I wanted to say, &#34;You know this the first and now the last time I will be coming here.&#34; 

Decided to let the food be the judge of whether to actually return. I can stomach some lackluster customer service when just popping in and out for take-out. Unfortunately, the food was just meh. Extra super large portion of chicken fried rice can make 2 - 3 meals but lacked flavor. Starters (satay and tempurah) were the same -- just meh. No utensils in take-out bag.

Oh well, now I know."

While I love noodles, that&#39;s about all there was on the plates. The shrimp dish which they charge an extra $2 for had only 7 little shrimp and there were almost no veggies at all. The flavors were good but a bit on the overly sweet side. All this would have made the experience a little ho-hum but *then* there was the music. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t judge a restaurant by it&#39;s music BUT in the hour and a half that I spent there, they only played a single song. No kidding! They had one song with a slightly off-key instrument looping, and looping, and looping... Could not get that crazy song out of my head when we left! Not expecting to be back anytime soon."

I went here on my birthday last year, and was pretty psyched to have my favorite food.

My mom and I each ordered a curry dish and my mom wasn&#39;t happy with what she received. She barely ate it, and told the server she didn&#39;t want it. The manager simply would not refund her...he  wouldn&#39;t even refund HALF. They gave her the hardest time, which put her in a bad mood, which put ME in a bad moon (On my birthday, nonetheless). My mom had to dispute it through her credit card company.

I can understand refusing to refund if you&#39;ve eaten, say, half or all of your dish, but she ate just enough to justify not liking it. Other places will ALWAYS refund if you&#39;re unhappy...customer is always right, correct? Apparently not here...sad, Gumrai, you&#39;ve lost a fan."

Im talking like everything from the veggie soup and veggie wonton (i&#39;m now a vegetarian for a year and its hard to find great veggie soup!)things they give to you for free while waiting for food,down to the two incredible entrees my fiance and I shared!We ordered the Pad Thai w/ tofu and Ginger tofu for a late lunch and ate the rest later for dinner and it was still delich.

Now for the downside (and it could have just been a random occurence) but it was around 2pm (not usually a busy time) and we walked in to another family waiting to be seated with a half full restaurant. We both waited there for an awkward 10 + minutes with staff that keep looking at us and not one of them greeting us! Mind you I was at a wedding the night before and starving,and this was kinda making me want to leave. But once they finally aknowledged the family before us and sat them they sat us as well. But after we were sat we had already picked out our entrees in the wait,but again were not greeted -or given water- for another 10-15 minutes. Once we ordered our app came really fast (they gave me the chicken thing and I had to tel them I cant eat it  and a diff waitress ran back and got me the veggie app plate super fast)and again was amazing! But right when we got our food our waitress took our half full drinks, practically while I was drinking mine,  and left us with nothing to drink for quite a while.  I even got a glance of them a full times sitting by the drink machine when she went in and out of the kitchen.I finally got her attention and said we have no drinks and she said &#34;sorry and ran to get them.&#34;

The staff was polite but obviously could not handle the restaurant for our first visit,but the food was so incredible we will be back and this time not go as hungry in case of another wait ;-)

Ps. If we go again and have a normal experience I will change the stars to 5!"

As we walked in, the dreary salmon decor and lackluster welcome we received gave us some pause but we decided not to judge the place by its dull pink walls. Now, I admit we should have known better than to order the sampler, but even so the platter of oily, smelly deep-fried mess that was plunked down in front of us was unexpected.

I ordered the ramen and Philadelphia maki. The maki was decent, but nothing to brag about. When our waitress came to us with our orders, they had gotten my order wrong, for some strange reason. So they took twenty minutes to make my ramen that I ordered. Their ramen was the worst ramen I have ever had in my entire life. The broth was SWEET not savory like it should be. And the noodles weren&#39;t even close to being cooked all the way. It was disappointing. And I didn&#39;t think it was possible to mess up ramen.

Let me preface this review by saying that I have been eating Thai food since I was a child, and I go to Thai restaurants ALL THE TIME! My point is, I KNOW MY PAD THAI. 

All I ordered was the Pad Thai with chicken, and a side of peanut sauce. It looked nice upon taking it out of the bag (I had ordered out), but as soon as I tried it, something tasted off. The chicken pieces in it were so OLD, that they smelled sour and tasted like...I can&#39;t even describe the taste, it was absolutely stomach- turning. I got sick later, that confirmed to me that the meat was in fact old. 

I don&#39;t get how this place has such great reviews? I guess it just had an off day yesterday? Any who, I do NOT recommend this place. Please BE CAREFUL if you choose to dine here!"

Time of my visit: Lunch

I chose this place because they offered Gyros.  The reviews on Yelp! were about as good as I would expect from a place like this one.

I arrived and was seated almost immediately.  The waitress came by very quickly and since I knew what I wanted, I placed my order right away.  I ordered Gyro and fries.

The first nice thing, I noticed, about the place was that they brought out a carafe of f water, made the water refills easier.

I did not have to wait long for my food to arrive.  It was a nice size plate.  Gyro looked big and there was plenty of fries.  Fries tasted average, nothing special, your typical fries.  The size of the Gyro was the pretty big, however, the taste was so so.  The meat was a bit more dry than I like, the pita was harsher than I like.  The amount of meat of the sandwich was a bit less than I anticipated.  I thought the price was a bit high as well $9.99 plus tax.

Overall a C-.  But I would like to come back and try their breakfast.

Side note: They don&#39;t accept AMEX, which is again a big pet peeve of mine.  At least there is a sign notifying customers of that."

Although this is an average restaurant they have the most pleasant, hardest working server/waitress (whatever the correct term may be now) that I have had the pleasure of meeting.

It took awhile to get a server and way too long for her to bring my coffee. She had a pretty big area that she was helping so after I figured that out, I cut her some slack.

We decided to go against the grain here and get some eggs. Hubby had an omelette with chorizo. He said it wasn&#39;t spicy enough. He likes his food very spicy, so maybe it was just medium chorizo.

I had the grecian omelette which had spinach, tomatoes and feta cheese. It was great! I had hash browns and a fruit cup. The hash browns were fresh and not overcooked and the fruit cup was a good size and all the fruit was nicely cup up. You know, some of those fruit cups just have big chunks of cantaloupe in them and not much else, but not here.

We have tried everything from biscuits and gravy to crepes to a chicken breast on a pita to the cream of chicken and rice soup to their poached eggs and their corned beef hash. Everything has been good. There is nothing fancy or overly interesting about any of their dishes, but for consistency, it&#39;s a nice choice.

For a place that calls themselves a pancake house they have the smallest list of pancake offerings I&#39;ve ever seen. There are not even any pancakes in their specialty section. Owners obviously paid a marketing firm to come up with a great name. It just doesn&#39;t really describe the business. Better name for business, would be breakfast/lunch place. Hint: create a pancake offering on the menu with maple and berries. You could even put it in your specialities section. Crazy thinking, I know. 

The big signs in the front windows stating its a non smoking business looks cheap. Hello, this went into effect 10 years ago, pretty sure no one will be surprised at this point. Believe there were a couple other signs that had nothing to do with the food posted in the windows too. My first impression was one of those furniture stores offering 70% off for their going out of business sale, but I digress.

Mapleberry gets busy during weekends but the restaurant itself has plenty of space. Any of the omelettes can be grilled instead of pan fried, which uses much less oil. You can also upgrade the pancakes that come with your dish for an extra $2 to any of the pancakes listed on the menu. My bf ordered the gyro omelette, which I actually liked better than my dish (I had a veggie omelette with avocado)."

It&#39;s not particularly far from where I work, but by the time they&#39;re open in the morning I&#39;m usually hard at work and had been unable to stop in. I finally made the trip to visit after well over a year of having scoped the place out.

The first thing to note is that the building itself is actually a ways off of Army Trail. Signage is visible from this very busy street, but the restaurant itself is actually off of Kuhn road and you have to either make a left there or drive through a parking lot to reach it. Once I finally made my way there I stepped in to a fantastic smell of pancakes, from first impressions that appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. 

After thoroughly investigating the menu I settled on a Mexican skillet with pancakes. Placed my order and waited, the wait was around 20 minutes (about a time and a half what most places I order skillets at take) and there wasn&#39;t a lot of customers. This was just slow service. Now the question became was the food worth the wait?

I dug into my skillet immediately and there wasn&#39;t a lot of egg, there was a decent amount of cheese but the chorizo was a bit on the weak side in terms of spice and flavor. The potato used for hash brown at the bottom of the skillet was mostly soft potato mush, it wasn&#39;t very crisp and it wasn&#39;t very tasty. The overall taste of this skillet was bland, it was certainly decent sized but it was made up mostly of potato.

The pancakes were slightly better but not by much. The pancakes themselves were dressed with powdered sugar, and came with maple syrup. The syrup was fairly thick but had more of a bitter taste than a sweet taste. I wouldn&#39;t say the syrup was bad, just not to my general liking.

Overall I&#39;ve certainly been to worse breakfast places than Mapleberry Pancake House. My food wasn&#39;t exactly bad tasting, just bland. While service was polite and friendly it was also slow. I&#39;ll rate this place well below average and give it two stars."

Very dirty. Waited a few minutes to be seated and noticed the floors were so filthy and not just by the entrance. Food stuck to bench of booth. Water glass smudged with remnants of lipstick. Went to washroom before waitress came to take order and was disgusted with the condition of the facilities. Came back to table without using the washroom and told my boyfriend my discovery.

It has a cute interior, nice seatings, plastic glasses, fill-your-own coffee mugs, ketchup in souffle cups and employees that really don&#39;t like to smile. During my first time here my service was terrible. So I decided to give it another try today and give them the benefit of the doubt because I didn&#39;t want to be one of those people that gives a bad review during their first visit. The girls at the front is the face of your business; the first everyone meets and the last your customers see. Being ignored, unwelcomed, and unthanked is not something we&#39;d continue give our business to. The service did however improve, but not enough to keep us. The customer service here should really step it up because the food is just not that great to keep people to come back. Unless of course you like fuzzy mold spots on your grapes and only one napkin to use (the one that your silverware is rolled in). Sorry, not sorry."

I don&#39;t eat pork products so I like that they have a turkey option. My fiancé eats plenty of pork for the both of us and loves the meat skillet. 

If you go on a weekend after 9:30, be prepared to wait because it&#39;s packed....which I think speaks volumes about the food. 

The only reason for the 4 star review is I think the portions are too large for 1 person and I hate wasting food."

The food is decent, but not as good as Brunch Cafe or Red Apple.  Their coffee is fairly weak, but this seems typical of places around here.  Portions are average.  Odd thing?

My biggest complaint is the service.  Wait staff is ok, but definitely stretched too thin.  Worse is the hostess - they routinely give us wait times 50% below actuals.  If you call ahead - they seem to be trained to say no wait.  Get there 10 minutes later?  30 minute wait.  It&#39;s annoyed me enough that I won&#39;t be coming back."

I&#39;m not a big coffee drinker, but I really enjoyed the coffee here.  I think the flavored creamers were a contributing factor.  My eggs were done just right and I thought everything was reasonably priced.

The restaurant itself is nice and open and bright.  It&#39;s a pretty big place, which is nice at those busy times.  Although it can be fairly loud, it&#39;s a not tooooo loud to have a conversation with my family.

The food is pretty good.  The first thing I tried, the golden french toast, was strange albeit edible.  It was an odd choice of ingredients to throw together on a plate, I didn&#39;t see it on the menu last time we were in, so maybe they realized it&#39;s not a great choice.  With that said, they still were able to pull it off and it was tasty.  My brother really likes their tamale and chili omelet.  

The service is always good.  No complaints there.  They never bug us but don&#39;t leave us waiting for them either. 

They have a huge sign in the window stating that their last tables are seated 15 minutes before closing time.  I don&#39;t really understand this theory, but, at least there is a sign letting you know.  So, while they close at 2:30, you need to be seated by 2:15 if you want to be served any food.  Which, to me, means you close at 2:15, but I&#39;m not a restaurant professional, I don&#39;t even play one on tv, so what do I know."

This was decent, but totally average.  We arrived to what appeared to be an extremely long wait.  Come to find out it was a large table waiting ot be sat together.  We were sat within 5 minutes.  Bonus...

The server was nice and brought out our own insulated pot of coffee for our table.  I have mixed feelings about this.  One... I&#39;m happy I have unlimited coffee but two, it is in a thermos and I&#39;m not really being waited on.  What the heck do you do with my coffee when I&#39;m done with it?  Serve the luke warm remnants to the next unsuspecting guest?

I ordered a denver skillet with a side order of buscuits and gravy.  The skillet was quite good.  The buscuits and gravy were marginal and had little to no sausage in the gravy.  It suspiciously tasted as if it were made from a packet despite the guarantee from the waitress that it was homemade.  Don&#39;t waste your side on this.. Get the pancakes.  

My husband ordered scrambled eggs, bacon hashbrowns and chocolate chip pancakes. A-OK in his book with the exception of his feeling the coffee tasted like water.  Perhaps he got someone else&#39;s left overs?

Last, I have to note the obnoxious sign as you enter the restaurant that they take their last walk in 15 minutes prior to closing?  Hey- here&#39;s a thought... Don&#39;t be ghetto and turn away business.  If someone wants to walk in 2 minutes to your 3:00PM closing time... SERVE THEM with a smile on your face or close earlier.  I dealt with this a server and you are not that awesome that ou can beat customers away wiht a stick.   Can&#39;t say I won&#39;t return but can&#39;t say that I will rush back."

This place is close by and we would always pass by.  It was almost so close we&#39;d forget about it.  But then one day we went in.  There always seems to be pretty quick service even if it looks busy.
My one gripe is they don&#39;t really have a good place for a baby carseat.  Ok, I suppose they dont&#39; need to, but it&#39;s either bring the stroller and block the aisle or squeeze into a couple of the booths that will fit the carseat.  The area up top works, but sometimes it&#39;s closed when they are ramping down.
I like the healthy pancake combo, I forget what it is called.  But it&#39;s like some egg whites, multigrain pancakes and some splenda syrup.  Oh and turkey sausage.  I&#39;m happy they have turkey sausages.  Too many places only have pork.  That&#39;s fine, but I prefer turkey.
Overall it&#39;s a good place, and we&#39;ve even done takeout (when our kid was first born and wifey had a hankerin for some hash browns.)

One thing to point out: if you get your hash browns well done, it seems to take a while."

Dining service is friendly. I like how they leave a carafe of ice water and a carafe of coffee at the table for you. There are the international delight mini creamers on the table if so need a little flava with your java. The menu has a lot of basic breakfast items on the menu with daily specials. It&#39;s also not hard to miss all the ads they place in their menu from the local businesses that want to advertise--I felt like I was reading one of those magazine flyers we get in the mail with all the coupons.

Not the case here. The Mapleberry Pancake House in Carol Stream was bustling with activity when I arrived on a late Sunday morning to satisfy my pancake craving. Families, cyclists, couples and singles all filled the airy restaurant.

The restaurant was fairly modern with light yellow ochre walls, tiled floor, and dark trim accents. The servers, primarily women, were all dressed in sleek black outfits with the word &#39;Mapleberry&#39; spelled out across the front of their shirts in eye catching bling (the fake rhinestone type). The bus staff, primarily men, wore black pants and yellow ochre shirts with &#39;Mapleberry&#39; embroidered in the pocket area.

I definitely wanted to try their pancakes, but I also wanted something more. It looked like their pancake orders didn&#39;t come with any sides. So I ordered one of the other specials on the menu which included eggs, two slices of bacon, one sausage link, pancakes, and juice. I asked if I could have blueberry pancakes instead of plain, to which my server said yes. The pancakes came with blueberry compote on top, but I was pleased to find that they also had fresh blueberries in the batter too.

Overall, the food was decent, prices were fair, service was okay, and bathroom was relatively clean. Definitely a family friendly place and worth a revisit to try other items on the menu."

Times have changed now, and if we&#39;re going to go out for a meal that costs a good amount, I expect the service to be - at a minimum - consistent.

We now rarely go to the Mapleberry for a couple of reasons. The first is, that their service is not consistent. They have one consistent server there, Sarah - and she&#39;s so popular that if you don&#39;t get there super early, well, you can&#39;t request her as your server. One time she had an extra table open, and they would not seat us in her section. I don&#39;t know if it was because so many people requested her, or what. 

Every other server that we&#39;ve had there has forgotten things, ordered things incorrectly, or even just trying to get them over to your table to refill a soda is a challenge in itself. They also do not check back often to see if you are doing ok.

The food and the cost. When we started going there I loved that they had an option for Whole Grain pancakes and turkey sausage. That was, until they raised the price of it by a couple of bucks. I know the economy is part of the drive with this...but there&#39;s no rhyme or reason to their price hikes at all, and they offer coupons in a couple of sources, but they aren&#39;t worth much -- and are only good during the week. 

We haven&#39;t been there in months, so in regard to the sizes of the servings shrinking, I can&#39;t really comment.

All in all, if you feel like splurging for a breakfast, and willing to take a chance on the service - go to the Mapleberry. Otherwise, you&#39;ll save about $30 alone just making it at your own house."

Problem is that the front area is small and congested where the hostess was taking people&#39;s payments and names down for tables.  Not a good idea if you are trying to keep the line moving.  

The service was definitely slower than normal and I have been to this pancake house a few other times.  The waitress was slow with bringing our food out.  Other tables received their food before I did and I placed my order way before they even got there.  Then the food was cold.  It seemed that the food sat out under a warmer b/c my omlette was slightly cold and the hash browns were cold.  

I&#39;ve eaten here before and was happier than this visit.  My friend and I asked for a take home box and separate checks.  Our waitress comes back to our table 5 minutes later with the checks separated but no boxes.  This woman needs to work on effiiency. The food was enjoyable, but I wish it was warmer.  I would try this place out one more time."

Good service, coffee pot on the table is always nice.  Everything tasted ok, but nothing stood out.  I&#39;ll go here again, no problem, it&#39;s just that I won&#39;t drive past another pancake house to get here.

The wait on Sunday at 12:20 was only ten minutes.  For a pancake house in a busy area, I would say that is NOT an endorsement."

Skip the french toast, it&#39;s boring and plain. For some reason, I like the hash browns more when I&#39;m dining in, rather when I&#39;m taking out because it doesn&#39;t seem so burnt when I&#39;m dining in.

I&#39;ve had the omelettes, they&#39;re pretty good but they&#39;re shaped like footballs for some reason? The large sausage links are pretty big, 3 is enough for a meal. The benedicts are really good, I like the hollandaise sauce they use, and i think they sprinkle some paprika on top. 

They always have a breakfast special menu, and the portions are pretty big for the price, so I always go for that! Environment is very home-y and waitresses are basically all skinny and brunette--just saying. haha, you&#39;ll notice. I have yet to try a skillet, but it&#39;s on my list of things-to-do for sure."

The food is below average - ordered biscuits and gravy and it was cold, have order eggs benedict where the eggs were overcooked (poached eggs should not be hockey pucks) and the staff seemed put out that I brought it to their attention.  I don&#39;t like to be negative after only one visit and that is why I&#39;ve given Mappleberry multiple chances - everyone can have a bad day.  But this has been a constant theme with them at each of my visits.  Also disappointed with the service.

I ordered a simple two egg breakfast, it came out cold- cold scrambled eggs- really? and runny, the bacon was undercooked, the hash browns were brown on the outside and raw beyond that. GROSS! The waitress never came back by even though I pushed the plate away. Finally she comes by to drop the bill and asks how the meal was,&#34; terrible, worse meal I have had&#34;. So she says really? I&#39;m sorry can we fix it? Um, no. I am not about to try round two.
At this point we ask for a bill for the drinks only since we didn&#39;t eat (my wife had an omelet that was runny also). So she gives us the bill,and goes over to a lady who is obviously the owner/manager and explains the situation, does the manager come by? NO, do they comp everything? NO. TERRIBLE. Absolutely the worst breakfast experience I have ever had. Kudos to the reviewer that was smart enough to just walk out before even ordering, wish I had had that foresight!"

A lot of the complaints I&#39;m reading about is the service... I understand it&#39;s frustrating to have to wait for food when you&#39;re hungry, but you have to expect this anywhere you go on the weekend. On Sundays, especially, when everyone is out of church. I think it&#39;s a GOOD sign when a breakfast restaurant is packed. And, they keep a large coffee carafe out on a table with cream and sugar for patrons waiting- so they DO realize it isn&#39;t fun to wait.

And, if you don&#39;t feel like waiting on a weekend, then go ahead and place an order to go. 

I have gone to Mapleberry for years and will continue to do so. The servers and hostesses are always very kind. The food is always delicious. The coffee is always hot."

I highly recommend the gyros skillet (it is &#34;egg&#34;quisite) and comes with pancakes or toast. Portions are large, coffee is hot and they bring as many carafes of coffee as you want. Seems to be the same waitstaff over the years so there isn&#39;t much turnover. I recommend breakfast over their lunch menu...tried a few things off their lunch menu and they&#39;re just ok.

Mapleberry&#39;s atmosphere is nice and open on the west side with big windows, but the east side feels crowded and not nearly as nice. So we always hope to be seated in the nice open area. Our food has usually been very good, and service decent.
One major complaint I have personally is as follows: Once, my wife and I went in for breakfast, but we weren&#39;t exremely hungry so we decided to split a breakfast between us. When we ordered the meal and told the waitress we wanted to split it, she told us there was an additional $1 charge for that!!! What?! We should have gotten up and left, but it didn&#39;t settle on us what had just happened until we had already agreed. And then... when the food came out it was not even split up onto two plates! What did we pay the extra $1 for?? A penalty for not ordering two separate breakfasts? So what if some couple with just enough money for a breakfast for 1 came in to enjoy a morning out together by splitting a meal, and they encountered that attitude? I think of my wife&#39;s immigrant parents whey they were young and new in this country and didn&#39;t have much money.  Not sure if it was the restaurant&#39;s policy or just the whim of the waitress (tall, older, slim lady with straight black hair who has always had a less congenial disposition than the others anyway). At any rate it really turned me off Mapleberry for a while. I even thought of writing the local newspaper about it, but did not. We&#39;ve been back a couple times since then but not as frequently.
Also, my wife feels like even though we&#39;ve been going there for years the staff has never acted like they know us in any way, or welcomed us back as people whom they recognize at all. Not a big deal to me, but it is to my wife."

I&#39;ve eaten here 20-30 times, and overall I&#39;d say it&#39;s OK, but I&#39;ve decided to stop going and find another place. The food is decent and usually very well cooked.  The eggs they use are probably the smallest commercially available. The bacon is thin cut, not thick.(Strike One) The point here is that they still give you two eggs and three pieces of bacon, but they make more profit.   The service is pretty good and can depend on the server. A few of the servers are very nice, but most are not very friendly, but more business like. During the week there&#39;s no wait, but on the weekends, after 9:00 AM there can be  a 15-30 minute wait. They don&#39;t give customers access to their wifi there.... They have it but wont provide the password.(Strike Two). The room is very plain and uninviting. They don&#39;t have many booths and they have a lot of two tops. The two tops are narrow and they only have a foot or so between them....tough to get out and it&#39;s hard not to put a butt in the person sitting next to you&#39;s face when getting in and out...very cramped...again trying to fit more in to make a profit and less about giving the customer a good experience. 

The last straw and third strike came when after having patronized them for a few months and many visits, I made a simple request to the blonde woman who runs the place. It was actually a request for a 4 top booth by the window at a very uncrowded time. It was the type of thing that I never had to ask for at Nest Cafe or many other customer friendly places. She got this pissed off look and really tried to force me to sit where they normally put me. So that was it for me...for her, it&#39;s clearly about her, her profit and how she wants to run the place.... And it&#39;s not about the customer.  So today, I&#39;ve found a new place in Bartlett...The Savory Restaurant on West Bartlett Road.... Where I&#39;m currently typing this review after eating a great breakfast, with much larger eggs, thick cut bacon, wireless service (where the hostess eagerly gave me the password), a very nice room, a server who was very interested in how I was doing...several times during my meal in fact she came back to see how I was doing and they don&#39;t have any two tops, where they gladly sat me in a four top on a crowded Sunday and I had plenty of room to stretch out and didn&#39;t have stick my butt in someone&#39;s face getting in and out and where the person next to me didn&#39;t have to return the favor.

In a heads up comparison it&#39;s a no brainer. If you like Mappleberry, you&#39;ll probably love Savory, as it&#39;s my new breakfast place in town."

The gyros skillet was really good - lots of meat, lots of feta, lots of everything. Also came with a side of tzatziki, yum. Tim tested, cardiologist approved.

I also had some pancakes, since I had a choice of pancakes, english muffin, or biscuits and gravy as a side. They were mediocre; not as good as I&#39;ve had elsewhere because they seemed as though they&#39;d been sitting in a warming tray for a while, but still better than Bisquick. Same goes goes for the syrup - it had that awesome film on the top that says &#34;put me away or heat me up, but don&#39;t let me sit here any longer&#34;

Would I go back? Sure. It&#39;s close to home and relatively good food. It&#39;s not the cheapest place in town, but it&#39;s also not a crappy IHOP."

The place is pretty packed on a Sunday but the wait isn&#39;t long. There are a few tables that I was prepared to say &#34;No, we&#39;ll wait&#34; unless you want all those folks waiting for a table to be walking by every minute but we didn&#39;t get one of those.

To cut to the chase: only one of us got breakfast and even that wasn&#39;t great. I ordered the multi-grain pancakes with pecans. Out came a wheat waffle with pecans, which are sprinkled on top rather than cooked in as I would expect. No, wanted pancakes. Partner kept his skillet even though he was very specific that the eggs should have stopped running by the time they got to him. And they were decidedly still runny. Finally, my pancakes arrived. Three bites - flavorless and raw. Partner showed me his pancakes - not quite raw but not quite done either. The server was apologetic but if I were the manager there, this customer would have a coupon for free pancakes. But judging by the other comments, they would be giving away a lot of coupons if they adopted that policy. So I had coffee and we left.  How DO these kinds of places stay in business?"

It tasted as if the milk had gone bad. This was our son&#39;s meal. We of course told our server who sent the owner over. (Plastic looking woman.) Simple problem, really. This woman however, took it so personally that he did not &#34;like&#34; the biscuits and gravy. ITS HER OWN PERSONAL RECIPE, HOW COULD WE NOT LIKE IT?! ~ which was not the issue. The issue was that the ingredients were bad. Rotten milk is rotten milk, if someone tells you this to your face rather than the health department, listen. She argued with us about this issue pretty intensely and the conversation ended when realized that we were going to pay for the 2 bites taken because she simply was not taking it off the bill, period. Yes, she made us pay the percentage of what we ate. And we shared our small portions with our son because he refused to order anything else. This calculating woman. Wow.

We will never be back there. This was a couple years ago, I am surprised they are still there."

I have to say the food is good with unique choices for breakfast, not found elsewhere.  Also great kona coffee.   We got there just before 2pm with last seating at 230, close at 3.  I thought we had plenty of time, but they started vacuuming at 215, stocking/refilling tables, staff scurring about as if they were closing at 2:30, they even took the drawer out of the register.  When we got there, right away we could tell the waitress had an attitude, seems like she had already checked out.  We were seated with no silverware and ended up getting our own off another table.  We waited a long time for coffee refills and then she sat at the table next to us, that she made as her refill station, with all her sugar packs/condiments ect..  How uncomfortable trying to eat with our waitress right there so close, working on something else.  As were eating she dropped a salt shaker and it hit me in the foot.  She did say sorry, but with such a tone like she didn&#39;t care.  To top it off when we went to pay, the manager at the counter already left and it was our waitress at the register.   I couldn&#39;t wait to leave, and neither could they.   Even though they are technically open till 3pm, DO NOT GO THERE IN THE LAST HOUR.  I don&#39;t need them, they need me.  I&#39;ll find somewhere else to eat."

I went there today and had an ok meal but the service was poor. I have to say that I have waited tables on and off for 25 years and know the difference between what the server has control of and what is beyond the servers control. I had two problems with the meal and the server didn&#39;t even try to make it  right. I have never written a bad review like this but if your food is just ok , you need to have better servers."

The staff is now super friendly, and even the bus boys are smiling and greet you. They have new menus, a huge variety.  The food is excellent, and good portions.  I just wish they could get my hash browns crispy, the top layer is good and then the rest is all that white potato.  Their potato pancakes are awesome!  Very good Eggs Benedict too. Excellent coffee.  Try the soups - very good!  Prices are comparable to other quality breakfast places, a little more that some but worth it."

Not much changed, but it did seem the servers were a bit more on the ball.  They were a completely different group than before and they seemed to want to do a good job. However, the kitchen was slow, our orders were cold when they arrived and the food was off just a little bit (American cheese is rarely shredded, but the waitress insisted that the cheese inside the omelet was that and not cheddar).   I think I could have gotten a better value going to the IHOP."

Beef chow fun, extra crispy noodles: make sure to get the noodles extra crispy! Crispy on the outside, but chewy on the inside.
Szechwan shrimp: I think this is what we usually order. It&#39;s a nice seafood dish to go with all the meat that we usually order.
BBQ pork fried rice: your typical fried rice dish.
Hot and sour soup: your typical hot and sour soup, good to order a large and share.
Chinese broccoli: you definitely need to get some sort of vegetable dish, and this one is perfect to balance out all the other protein and carbs.
Orange beef: this is usually a table favorite, we almost always order this.

For the kids, it&#39;s best to order the shrimp dumpling noodle soup and just split it up amongst them."

We went yesterday, to notice that they got new tables, new chairs, new mugs, new plates, and real chopsticks (not the wooden disposables). Nice. 
Perhaps to cover the cost of these new utensils....portions of entrees were nearly halved. Not nice. 
Furthermore the pickled veg and pork over rice and szechuan beef over rice was bland, and the soup of the shrimp wonton wasn&#39;t up to its former standard, and instead very stale.

Service was attentive but very rude. 

SO disappointed. Used to be our favorite."

If you&#39;re a fan of noodles and meat I would beyond beyond recommend the BBQ pork Chow Funn. It comes with veggies but I personally prefer no veggies because you get so much more noodles and meat. The meat is super tender and flavored so well. The noodles are perfectly soft yet the right amount of crispy at the same damn time. LOVE. Picture to follow on my next return. 

I&#39;m also a fan of their potstickers. If it&#39;s one dish I had to live off of for the rest of my life it would def be potstickers and theirs are at the top of the list. Fluffy, doughy, crispy and full of flavor.  YUM. 

I&#39;ve also tried their fried rice which is pretty decent. Getting to go is my go to. I&#39;ve eaten there once before and the service was okay, felt a bit rushed other than that it was fine. Def more of a to go joint. 

Good food and decent prices this one is def a must try. Chow Funn noodles all day!"

I DO NOT know most of the dishes since I usually always only ordered the dumpling noodle soup.  For me, it always hit the spot.  Not just me.  It hit my hubbys spot too.  It is not high end.

This is our first time coming into the restaurant because my uncle was the head chef here and he would buy the wontons and we will cook it at home. This time we ordered shrimp won ton soup and shrimp dumpling bbq pork noodle soup. I was very disappointed when I took that first bite of the shrimp wonton, it was not fresh. Then I took a sip of the soup and its too bland. This was not the taste I used to remember. The shrimp wonton used to be flavorful with a taste of crispy shrimps and the soup was sweet because they brew it with fresh pork bones but now it&#39;s all gone.

I only come here when I know I&#39;m okay with indulging because the portions are huge and the food is so good, you&#39;ll eat through the full if you aren&#39;t careful.

First of all, when you walk in out of the frigid Chicago winter, they immediately bring over a glass of hot tea. I cradled the warm glass in my hands while I read through the menu and felt myself thawing out quickly. A nice touch.

My friend and I, forever gluttons, started with an order of pot stickers. Be prepared for greasy for sure. These are not for dieters. But if you are in the mood for a nice doughy, perfectly flavored and meaty pot sticker, you&#39;ll win big.

I ordered the sesame chicken with fried rice. I know! Cliché. I don&#39;t care. The sauce on the chicken was dark and divine. It had a nice balance of flavors. I&#39;m a big fan of spicy things so, of course, I added a lot of the chili sauce that was easily available on the table. And I&#39;m glad that I liked it because I&#39;ll be eating again for lunch today (and possibly for dinner tonight - huge portions!). 

So lessons learned: 1) Wear layers. We went from cold to very hot pretty quickly. It was probably where our table was in the front corner. We were directly under two vents. 2) Great place if you want to share. My friend and I each ordered an entrée. That was way, way more food than we needed. We could easily have split the entrée."

I grew up on Filipino stews and canned soups. The one with a red and white label. When I had Seven Treasures&#39; won ton noodle soup with bbq pork for carry out. I was hooked. Something about the piping hot amalgamated broth. All dente noodles and shrimp won tons held up. Never mushy. Even when reheated just under a minute in the microwave the next day. Add some water to cut saltiness. BBQ pork, Chinese broccoli, red garlic hot sauce...memories take me back to a day in the 90&#39;s.

Ramen and pho noodles couldn&#39;t compare. I tried other restaurants&#39; won ton noodle versions. Non came close.

Then Yelp appeared. Discovered there was Wonton Express. Rumor owner related to someone at Seven Treasures. Dish was almost equal to original. Restaurant now gone.

So in the midst of current Y2K decade  another similar rumor appeared for Wonton Gourmet in Des Plaines. Sure enough, I dragged the family there.

It was another force discovered. Wonton Express&#39; wonton noodle soup had a twin sister! Are you saying Seven Treasures fathered another? An enigma you say? The flavors are so close.

My husband can order his favorite chow of bbq pork with fried egg over rice.

We still crave Seven Treasures and make the trek but Wonton Gourmet is so much easier on our travel.

Service is what it is. Good. Women&#39;s bathroom decent. Own parking lot.

Must try.

They have their own private parking lot so you don&#39;t have to worry paying the street parking meters like in the city.  As you walk in, it&#39;s an open space with a view of the chefs cooking our dishes, but don&#39;t compare to Yu&#39;s Mandarin of their open view of the chefs cooking they are not there to entertain us, just cook delicious food fresh and hot BOOM!
The open space has a long lounge chair that acts like a divider across the middle of the room.  You can have big groups here, it&#39;s a divey feel not elegant Chinese dinning with fine china and white linen napkins.
The staff is friendly and they are quick with your order, so decide what you want to order first before you start chatting up a storm.  They are attentive refilling your hot tea or water or whatever drink you ordered.
Now on to the food  This is what I have tried:
For starters, crab rangoon (4 pcs) LOVE it nice and crispy big pieces and watch out it&#39;s hot filling
Their egg rolls I love them!  It&#39;s hot and crispy with seasoned cabbage, pork, and shrimp (2 pcs) or you can ask for one but why just one?
Another disk is pot stickers (6) huge pieces crispy on the outside and plenty of filling inside yum!
I love their shrimp fried rice, they have little shrimps and without those extra fillers of peas and carrots.  And the rice is nicely seasoned with scrambled egg and a brown color to it, not yellow colored fried rice...I mean yellow fried rice really, ah no thanks that&#39;s not fried rice.
When I have a taste for soup, I&#39;d order a bowl of Shrimp Dumplings with noodles (the dumplings has pork and Chinese mushrooms) which I like.  I also ordered both Shrimp Dumpling and won ton with noodles.  It&#39;s a pretty good size to eat for 2 to share or have it for one person as a meal.
Hubby would order Hot and Sour Soup, it&#39;s peppery, thick, spicy, and lots of stuff like tofu, bamboo shoot, Chinese mushrooms, etc.
My go to noodle dish is beef chow fun extra crispy with Chinese broccoli so good, just like Chinatown.  
My hubby likes their sliced BBQ pork with a fried egg over friend rice.  It&#39;s big enough to share but he no share it&#39;s MINE he says, lol.
Sometimes we would order a side order of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  That is fresh, hot and plenty to share.
Their dishes are mainly family style orders which it great with a big group.  We would order one dish each and then share amongst each other yum.
So if you live in the burbs and don&#39;t want to take a hike into Chinatown (unless you have the munchies and don&#39;t mind the after clubbing drunk crowd) then check out this place."

I have been here for lunch several times, they get busy at lunch but the servers are fast and friendly. They greet you at the table with a large cup of hot tea.  My most recent lunch was hot and sour soup and braised noodles Peking style with shredded pork and green pepper.  The soup is so nice especially on one of these cold days. It is the most &#34;sour&#34; soup I have had, I tend to dose it with chili oil to get the &#34;hot&#34; to match the sour. It&#39;s a large portion portion of soup.  The pork and noodles arrive hot, the noodles are cooked perfectly with pork and thin green pepper slices with some brown sauce.  Some of the pork shreds come out crispy, the whole dish is very tasty, especially with some chili oil!  The hot tea and ice water are replenished often.

I love this place, I come in whenever I have the chance."

I&#39;ve gone here for years and just kept going back for the tasty food but never thought the service was anything but mediocre.  BUT TONIGHT was such a disappointment.  The only way to get waiters attention was wave my arms and say hello, excuse me, etc 5 times in a row and they were standing so close but just not even looking up, and saw them later seated at a table busy with their phones.  3-4 tables of diners and these two guys are sitting at a nearby table playing with their phones.  No one ever approached my table to see how my dinner was or if I needed anything and when I did need something I had to wave or look for them, or hope they were passing by serving a table.  My soup came out and within 3 to 4 minutes my entrée came, placed on the table and he was gone.  I hadn&#39;t even started my huge bowl of soup, I really should&#39;ve sent it back.   My tea glass sat empty, my water sat empty later.  A waiter walked by 3 times before he offered tea, and I had moved the empty glass to the open table area.
     Sadly the food was not as good as I remembered and then to top everything off they seemed to be power washing the kitchen with diners still here and the kitchen door open.  In fact I noticed the kitchen staff guy standing watching diners but waiters never paid attention 
Sadly, I didn&#39;t care as much for the food, and I could&#39;ve used that $20 and bought myself something that would&#39;ve lasted much longer than the memory of a bad meal outing.
     And to show it wasn&#39;t just me, another couple left at the same time I did and said the same ... They were Asian so I know my poor service wasn&#39;t because I wasn&#39;t.  I observed the same indifference at tow other table.  Worst service there ever.  If I didn&#39;t want to leave as soon as I was done, I wouldn&#39;t have left the less than generous tip I did, but I didn&#39;t want to wait for change...
     Wonton Gourmet, read your Yelp reviews... You food can rock but your service has gone from &#34;I really don&#39;t care&#34; to &#34; I just don&#39;t give a crap&#34;.  Your food was too good to lose customers over indifferent service.  I hope you care.

So sad... I really liked it there."

Authenticity - 4/5
Service - 3/5
Food - 3/5, unless you&#39;re just talking about the panfried noodles, then 5/5

This review is more geared on the dine-in experience. If you do takeout, that may be the way to go.

This was my go-to suburban &#34;authentic&#34; Chinese restaurant.... but then again, it all depends on what you look for when it comes to authentic Chinese food. Back when I discovered WonTon Gourmet, I had a helluva time finding a so-called &#34;authentic&#34; Chinese restaurant that served real chow mein. Not the straggly noodles you find in your local Chop Suey restaurant, but real, authentic, crispy, Cantonese panfried noodles. And not only are they panfried to an awesome perfect crisp, they also offer Chinese broccoli. If you never had Chinese broccoli, it is waaaay more tastier than regular broccoli. 

In terms of other levels of authenticity, this place has it. The cranky old lady manning the front door/register, the dingy disgusting bathroom, similar to chinatown, and actual asian people cooking your food. They also serve many different bowls of wonton soup, although the soup comes with just four wontons floating in a bowl of MSG. The service is authentic as well -- they&#39;re not the best in this category, but they get the job done.

Although I don&#39;t go here as often, because I found a closer restaurant that serves my beloved Cantonese panfried noodles, I do try to come here, a few times when the mood strikes. We came here one day and ordered our beloved noodles and some potstickers.The pot stickers skin was thick, and I&#39;m not a big fan of thick skin. Also, what is weird is it didn&#39;t come with any garlic sauce. 

The noodles were awesome as always. I ordered the chicken with chinese broccoli chow mein and the seafood combo chow mein. The chicken with chinese broccoli was awesome. The seafood combo chow mein was OK... I remember ordering it before and its pretty obvious that their seafood is frozen. The squid in it was extremely chewy and the crab meat was the imitation kind. 

The bill was probably the final kick in the teeth, in terms of dine-in experience. There were just four of us and we got the tip already baked into the bill. Wtf? I&#39;m a pretty good tipper, and I&#39;m sorry if others have stiffed them in the past. Also, I would understand if there were 10 of us... it was just 4. So, I gave them the tip they &#34;suggested&#34;, no more, no less. Sucks to be them.

BATHROOM REVIEW:
Bathroom as mentioned was somewhat dingy. Puke green floors and dark. Cranky old man in the bathroom for ambiance. It had two stalls and a urinal. It was somewhat clean, but yeah, sit or squat? I&#39;d squat."

1st of all, the owner/manager/receptionist does not hear/speak English well.  Good luck trying to place an order in advance... 2) When you go pick-up your order, they make you feel as though they are doing you a favor by selling you their food. 3) I have been here twice just to make sure they weren&#39;t just having a bad day. 4) The food is better than other Chinese places in the area so it does satisfy the Chinese fix but by NO MEANS considered delicious unless you have an easy palate to satisfy. 5) I&#39;m definitely partial to whether the food tastes well or not.  I&#39;m also a big fan of service and the dining experience, so there is NO WAY I would actually dine here so I could be served poorly; it all starts with the owner/manager/receptionist.

This place is definitely authentic, but I will start planning better just to drive down to Chinatown for at least delicious Chinese meal. I can&#39;t be sure that service would be any better as Chinese restaurants aren&#39;t typically known for good customer service.  I grew up in Chinatown and worked in our family restaurant since I was a teenager so I can actually give my expert opinion on customer service.  LOL...  If I do find a Chinese restaurant that serves delicious Chinese food with a smile and attentive service, you&#39;ll be the 1st to know.  Until then, let&#39;s just focus on delicious food..."

I have been going here almost every Friday and Sunday night ever since I was little and it is my go-to place before or after I travel since it is so close to O&#39;hare airport.
Their portions are very generous and the quality is great.

I like my surroundings here as well. clean and spacious (not dingy and cramped like the Chinese restaurants in Chinatown square). well-lit and the sun brightens up the whole place in the daytime. 

Here are my recommended dishes that I always have over the 20 years I&#39;ve been going here:

APPETIZERS:
1. highly recommend the POT STICKERS-- they are not like traditional dumplings where the skin is thin and the meat is meager. These pot stickers have a thicker skin and there is a nice clump of meat in there and it tastes delicious dipped in soy sauce and some hot chili oil. 

2. The FRIED CHICKEN WINGS- because I try to eat healthy, I only eat these on special occasions but it is always a treat! These fried chicken wings are fried and seasoned with a type of curry so it has a little spice to it. 

3. FRIED SHRIMP WONTON and CRAB RANGOONS are great too-- the crab rangoons have a nice and true cream cheese filling

4. Chinese FRIED BREAD STICK- goes so well dipped in congee. or alone. don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s like an asian version of a churro. better than churros.
For congee, I recommend the Chopped Beef+Preserved egg Congee


ENTREES:
1. HOUSE YANG CHOW FRIED RICE is my favorite fried rice dish- I like it &#34;house&#34; because then it includes bbq pork, egg, shrimp, and chicken. I also prefer &#34;yang chow&#34; (it&#39;s the &#34;white&#34; fried rice rather than the &#34;brown&#34; friend rice) because I feel like it&#39;s less salty.

2. Sweet and Sour beef

3. Volcano Shrimp

4. Beef and shrimp with (raw) egg over rice- this is not actually raw egg over rice...the egg is like the texture in an egg-drop soup

NOODLE DISHES:
1. The WONTON NOODLE SOUP WITH ROAST DUCK- This is their signature noodle soup dish. love the egg noodles, love it paired with roast duck, and love the broth.

2. Beef with black bean chow fun

3. Highly recommend the Gan Chow Beef Fun 

4. The Chow mein dishes are amazing especially when I get the crispy chow mein


Okay, I&#39;m done. I&#39;m Chinese and a huge foodie so you can trust my recommendations. Enjoy"

This is the closest thing I could find that come close to going to a hole in a wall in Hong Kong serving up authentic Cantonese style Chinese food. Yes, they help out the typical American pallet by offering &#34;fake&#34; Chinese dishes like General Tso, Fried Wontons, and Chop Suey. The real star is the authentic Wonton Soup dishes. They offer the added fare like Chinese BBQ pork and Beef Tripe with your Wonton Soup. They also have authentic rice dishes like Beef Chow Fun and Seafood with Bird&#39;s Nest (Don&#39;t worry - It&#39;s fried noodles shaped into a Bird&#39;s nest.) The place is improved from their original location in which you had to wait an hour or more for a table. Their latest location can hold four times the amount of people. The looks are not fancy but who cares - the food is authentic. Think hold in the wall. Service is great in Chinese standard. American&#39;s might not take highly of this style though. The only problem I have is they start cleaning the grills before everyone clears out within 30 minutes to close. Though I should be happy they clean the place daily. The best part of all this overall, it is located in the Chicago suburbs. No need to travel all the way to Chicago&#39;s Chinatown. So if you want to try &#34;real&#34; Cantonese style Chinese food. Come here!

Great Wall pictures and a nice seating arrangement along  with good tasting and smelling Chnese food makes this place a fun visit for a Chinese eating experience. This is a place where many actual Chinese seem to go unlike some other Chinese restaurants.

The service, however, was impeccably awful. This incident happened some time ago, so hopefully SIGNIFICANT strides have been made to improve the service aspect of the staff at this restaurant. Long story short, we came in one time, received incredibly sub-par/non-existent service from our waiter; our sentiments regarding the service was then rightfully reflected in our tip. Lo and behold, the waiter who could not have cared less promptly chased us as we headed to the parking lot  and demanded a larger tip. 

We were obviously in awe at that point and gave him a dollar or two just out of sheer confusion.

But yeah. No."

Since I am further out now, I usually come only after a visit to the airport.

I absolutely LOVE the chopped beef over rice (mian zhi niu rou fan)! Definitely my go to- I have yet to find a place that makes their chopped beef over rice the way Wonton Gourmet does in the Chicagoland area. Overall, their dishes are on the saltier side, so I ask for my dishes with less salt (I prefer blander foods), and add more salt as needed. Their wonton soup, of course, is also a something to try, although in my experience, their chopped beef over rice is what makes my visit special :)

The service has been a positive experience in all my trips, the turnaround is quick, and the price is great."

For under $7 you can get a full dish and be completely satisfied.

We started with a &#34;small&#34; hot and sour soup, which I was thinking maybe a cup since it was only $2.70, but they gave us a big bowl that we were able to split amongst three of us! It was delicious and bursting with flavors.

Roast duck over rice - the dish I always crave for, but it&#39;s always a lot of rice and never enough duck. Some of parts of the duck were only skin and the duck lacked some flavor, but the skin was crispy and the meat was good when there was some.

BBQ pork over rice - I&#39;m not a bbq pork person, but this dish was pretty good and the pork had a tasty flavor.

Beef chow fun with CRISPY noodles - my absolute favorite! esp. with the crispy noodles (you have to ask for it) the beef is full of flavor and the crispiness of the noodles give it a nice crunch. De-lish!

Overall, a satisfying meal and I was quite shock as to the service I received. I&#39;ve been to Wonton before and they lacked in good service, but this time around my water was constantly filled and the servers were more tentative."

We would usually get an order of chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, and my dad would order some meat and rice dish.  Back then, I loved going, maybe not as much for the food as for the quality time with my pops.

The few times I&#39;ve eaten at Wonton Gourmet as an adult, the food has been just alright -- I will still order the wonton noodle soup (ordered some for takeout today - definitely hit the spot although for me it&#39;s more of a &#39;junk food&#39; craving then anything else).  I typically have ordered the food to go versus dining in, however the woman at the front desk is honestly one of the rudest and most bitter looking hostesses I have ever met.  I think I&#39;ve seen her smile once in all the years I&#39;ve been eating there and ordering out, and every time I call, she barks into the phone &#34;WONTON GOURMET, WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?&#34; like a drill sergeant.  Today when I went to pick up my order, she gave me a hard time about asking for an extra sauce container of hot chili oil.  Once I got home, I realized that they had charged me for extra noodles and didn&#39;t include them in the bag... oh well.

My boyfriend has eaten there a few times (with me and with a few friends), and every time he has eaten the food he says its super bland and tastes like MSG and grease.  I still get cravings for the wonton noodle soup, so I will probably go back in the future, but I try to get in and out as quick as I can.

I personally wouldn&#39;t recommend this place if you are looking for ambiance, friendly service, or truly tasting or enlightening food (there are definitely better chinese places in the suburbs and the city), but if you are the mood for cheap and quick chinese in the area, it&#39;s not bad (but I guess I&#39;m biased for their wonton noodle soup)."

I&#39;m now a fan but there were a couples flaws in the dinner. First,the entrees all came at different times rather than together. One entree was so late I really thought they had forgotten the order which was a conceivable idea since the waiter wrote nothing down.  The second flaw was the Beef Chop Suey...not a fan. The vegetables tasted damn near raw which I&#39;m not a fan of. All in all the Chop Suey was average at best and the Egg Roles are 6/10.

Now for the good stuff, the portions are enormous. For a single order of Egg Fu Yong you get 3 large portions. The Fried Rice also was very good and another large portion. People sitting next to us appeared to be having S/S Pork, I had buyers remorse after seeing that. It looked fabulous. Gonna try it next time because I will be going back.

Last thing, the price is good for the enormous amounts per plate . Our bill came to $48+ for a family of 4. Not too bad."

We ordered wonton noodle soup... Used to be good, now only wonton really good,  noodles tasteless! Beef chow fun with black beans... Beef was good but too many peppers and onions not cooked properly. And side of roasted duck... Was ok... Wasn&#39;t the best I have ever had..  as well as dumplings which was probably only good thing of the meal.

We debated on tip but my mom has been chased to her car last time for not leaving enough tip like many of reviewers here so we didn&#39;t risk it and tipped close to 20%!!  Although I think when a place threatens u for tip its time to put on the X List! We parked close to door just in case. LOL! But the worst part was taking tip $ before we were done!

I&#39;ve also ordered take out and no issues with that either. Pass on the egg rolls, they&#39;re big but the wrapping is kinda thick and leaves a pasty after taste.

I remember the days when it was in a little strip mall and it was just a tiny tiny room that did mostly take-out business. 

The old guys would be on your left working their magic with steam, fire, sizzle, and fresh noodles while sprinkling in a little incoherent Chinese but in the end, they produced a fresh pot of the BEST dumplings, succulent sliced roast duck and hot chili oil sauce. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it now.

I saw the sign as I was driving by getting lost and I just had to pull in for a quick small bowl of shrimp wonton soup with no noodle. $5. Shoot me for ever moving away from this place. The same old guy with the shaved head and Adidas Superstars greeted me at the door and I felt like I was 16 again. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been that long. 

I plopped my butt down on of the half banquettes and placed the order without batting an eye at my menu. My wontons were promptly placed in front of my ever greedy hands and I ate far too much in far too little time. 

The hot chili oil and immense aroma of the chicken stock brought me back to happy gluttonous times of my teenage years and I was a happy girl. The bowl was enormous and definitely far too big for one person and the fresh scallions on top made a lovely garnish that added to the dish itself. 

Wontons should be made by hand, filled with shrimp, pork, veal (in my family), egg, vegetables, cellophane noodles and a fresh thin gyoza wrappers. The more time it sits out, the drier and harder it becomes. I&#39;ve never had any issues with my wontons here and I&#39;m happy to see this place hasn&#39;t changed much."

The 2nd visit, we had the beef chow fun, tender beef, noodles were pan fried just enough for outer crispness.  The shrimp and eggs, tho simple, had a nice wok flavor in the eggs, and could have been just a bit more wet.

In the winter your drink choice will default to hot tea.  In the summer they assume you want ice water.  I have never ordered anything different.

My friend and I went to Dinner on a Thursday night. The hostess greeted us and sat us at a table and our waiter came and poured our waters and to take our orders. I ordered the shrimp egg foo young which, as i understand, comes with plain steamed rice. I asked the waiter if I could substitute the white rice for fried rice, and was even willing to pay more, but he said that I couldn&#39;t. 
The food took longer than normal today. He brought the food plate by plate until everything was served. When he brought my friend her food, which came up first, he stared at her as he walked away. We were wondering what he was staring at but we didn&#39;t say anything. Then when it was time to pay the bill, my friend paid cash and I paid the balance on my debit card. The waiter had THE NERVE to look at the receipt and ask &#34;Are you going to leave the tip on the table&#34;? I explained to him that i didn&#39;t have any cash on me so I was going to run out to my car to get cash but I wanted to pay first because I didn&#39;t want anyone to think that I was running out on the bill but after he said something I began to feel uncomfortable so I decided to leave the tip on my card. The waiter came back again and was watching us so we asked him &#34;What&#39;s up, did you need anything?&#34; then he demanded a 10% tip. 
First of all, I&#39;m all for tipping even 20% but for good service. The service was crappy. No one came to check on us. No one offered us a beverage, we had to ask for one.

So, my wife and I finished doing some late night shopping and wanted some Chinese food before heading home for the night.  The sign on the door said they closed at 11pm, and we had walked in around 10:03pm.  There were still quite a few people in there, some families were eating still.  So, we were seated, and the waiter came to our table, handed us some menus and asked if we knew what we wanted.  Whoa!!!  We just sat down???!!!!  He left for about 2 minutes, then came back with some water.  He didn&#39;t even asked if we wanted anything else to drink.  He then asked again if we were ready, so I was - and then my wife was ready.  We were really feeling rushed.  He took our order, and the food came pretty fast.  It was pretty good, but parts of my food were cold.  A few minutes into our meal, the mean-faced looking lady that worked the cash register came over, and asked if we could pay now.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it, so I paid.  Our waiter came back with the change, and then we continued to eat.  My wife had asked what time it was, and it was about 10:30pm.  As we were eating I did notice they were putting chairs on the top of tables, and they also began mopping the other side of the restaurant.  Now, I did notice a few minutes after we received our food that the kitchen lights went out.  So, it starts to dawn on me.  They were trying to get out of there early, and they were rushing us out.  So, we finished and my wife and I started walking out.  As I was walking out our waiter calls for me, and I thought I had forgot something on the table.  I looked back and he was holding the check tray, and he says that I did not leave a tip.  I was confused, as was my wife.  we looked at each other in awe...  I told the waiter that I didn&#39;t have to leave atop.  He repeated himself, and I told him that I didn&#39;t even have anymore cash.  My wife also told him that she didn&#39;t have cash, just credit cards.  As he asked me again, the mean-faced lady at the register says &#34;no good&#34;.  So looked at my wife, and then left.  This place is definitely on my BLACKLIST!!!!!  With service like, and to think you deserve a tip is RIDICULOUS!!!!  The food is good, not great...  I am in the military, and I have been to hundreds, maybe thousands of places in my life.  This place really takes the cake, I have never been told that I have to leave a tip (for two people).  Now, it&#39;s understood that if there&#39;s more than five people, yes I would probably expect the gratuity to be included in the bill...

Good eating to you all..."

I am very particular about Chinese food and have had mediocre/bad food before.  I live right in the area and I cannot believe it took me years to try this place.  It is excellent.  Everything I have had there from the egg rolls, tea, crab rangoon, beef&amp;broccoli are amazing.  As long as I live here I will alway come here.  Very friendly, helpful staff.

The same lady who took my order on the phone attended me right away before I could even sit down at the bar. I was out of there within 2 minutes. 

The food isn&#39;t the greatest. It&#39;s a bar, though, so not bad either. I used to come here for karaoke nights and it was the same atmosphere, thirsty looking guys who stared my girlfriend down the whole time we were there. She was the one who told me and that she felt uncomfortable. Same thing karaoke nights, high Male:Female ratio with the atmosphere that follows that. Typical suburban bar, not too divey though."

My parents, sister, friend, and myself found ourselves at M T Barrels when our stomachs just couldn&#39;t handle waiting for food any longer (we were at a local food truck fest prior to this). After a quick Yelp search, I found out that M T Barrels was near by. We showed up at about 2:45 pm on a Saturday and the bar was pretty empty with the exception of a few people sitting up at the bar.

We were immediately greeted by the bartendar who seemed to be running the front of the house on his own. He let us know that the kitchen doesn&#39;t open until 3 pm, so we decided to start with some beer. They had really cheap pitchers of Miller Lite and Coors, so we ordered a couple of those for the table. Our server (I wish I could remember his name) was hilarious. He emphasized with our hunger and joked around with us as well.

The venue itself is pretty cool. I&#39;m a sucker for live music so I appreciated the fact that they have a ton of cover bands scheduled to play on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. 

When the food hour finally hit, we ordered the Barrel Bender app which is a large platter that includes pretzel and mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders, wings and poblano bites. Boom, boom, and boom. Everything on the platter was really good! A definite win for a big group to share.

I honestly got pretty filled up from the app platter (and beer), so I really shouldn&#39;t have gotten a meal at all, but I joined the rest of my table in ordering and got the BBQ ranch chicken salad. I mean come on, salad is light right? 

Well sure, salad is a lighter option, but this was a pretty big bowl full of goodies! Grilled chicken, lettuce, corn salsa, avocado, onion straws, chipotle ranch and a BBQ drizzle. It was really good, but I ended up taking the onion straws off. They were not as crunchy as I would have liked, so I just decided to forego them. The BBQ drizzle, chicken, and chipotle ranch were spot on though. I barely made a dent in the salad which was unfortunate, but I was sure to gobble up all the chicken!

My sister lives nearby, so I look forward to coming back to check out some of the bands they have lined up!"

But MT Barrels was another one of those spots.  We were staying near Schaumburg for work for a couple weeks, and it is always nice to find a beverage, a bite, and some live music on the weekend.  And Saturday nights seem to be the hard &amp; heavy night around here.

We got in a little early for the band and grabbed a spot at the bar where we could face the stage but still hear ourselves talk.  The place itself is nicer than your average dive bar, maybe not as well-dressed as some strip mall sports bars.   The bartenders were all very friendly, although they got a little indifferent as they got busier in to the night.  Drinks were what you would expect- not bad and not expensive.  Food was higher quality bar food-- we split the loaded chips, and they would have easily filled 3 or 4 people.  And the band that night was great.

Individually, the components at work could have slipped down to a three-star experience, but the total package was exactly what we were after for the night."

Service was slow in the beginning but once they knew we had a group and really spending money, the service picked up considerably.

Came right back and they&#39;re out of regular coffee. Only have decaf. Really? 
The &#34;security&#34; doesn&#39;t do a very good job for as many as there are.  Found a guy in the women&#39;s bathroom with a girl in the stall. Went to tell the bartender.

I&#39;ve been meaning to come back to this place since the changes took place some time ago, I finally did...this past weekend. 

This is a sports bar with a country twist.  I dig it.


You can avoid a $10 cover arriving before 8, not sure if this is the norm for all bands but that was the deal last weekend.  My friend and I came here to eat and check out the band.  I don&#39;t recall our server&#39;s name but she was wonderful and so attentive all night even with the place being busy. The food was pretty decent too. There is a nice selection on the menu.  The band didn&#39;t get cut short, in fact it was extended an extra 15 minutes so that was nice too!

Chilled beer and cheap! 
For food had the poblano peppers, veggie build your own burger.
The poblano peppers were super fun to eat! Bite sized poppers served with a dip. Nice one to snack on with some beer. 
So ordered the black bean burger and the sever lady came up to us before getting our burgers and said &#34; our chef says, this is the first time ever since he worked here one ordered a bean burger! And also said if you don&#39;t like it, we shall not charge you for it and offer you something else from the menu&#34;
We chuckled and were anxious to know what is so difficult in making a bean burger (not many order a veggie burger I guess) 
But but but the chef rocked it completely! 
The burger was epic! Nicely divided in to two halves served in 2 plates with waffle fries, looked and tasted delicious! 
The food is not only tasty but also inexpensive! 
The lady serving us being the only server that afternoon did a fabulous job for us. 
Surely returning back soon barrels!"

We went to see a band and the cover was $10.. it was a below average cover band that I wasn&#39;t sure was worth that $10 cover. Also, the front of the bar was &#34;reserved&#34; so no one could sit there, it would be helpful if they had the band playing remind people it&#39;s reserved seating otherwise your options are around the bar (fills up quick), one table by the bar, or in the back by the pool tables.. There was also jewelry being sold which took up a lot of space. The food was ok, we got the fried pickles which were ok and the mozzarella flats which were not cooked fully. Recommendations: check how much cover is before you go and see if you need to reserve a table."

We came here for a friend&#39;s bday and I expected to just tolerate it, but we had a blast. Sure there was a $5 cover, but I can forgive it because the live music (the GooRoos?) was decent, the drink selection was awesome, and the menu was great! After a couple of cocktails we decided we needed food and ordered a myriad of apps at our table: the hubs got waffle fries (hot, crispy, a huge mountain sized serving, and a spicy, creamy dipping sauce) and a BARREL of BACON (which is exactly what it sounds like and salty, crispy, brilliant perfection), and the rest of our table got amazingness like tot nachos, pretzel sticks, and wings. Everything was hot and freshly prepared and super tasty! Our server was incredibly attentive and the bar tender actually checked in on us to make sure we enjoyed our drinks. WHAT?! I thought this place was gonna be a pitcher o&#39; domestic beer and stand-on-a-sticky-floor kinda joint. I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong - in the best way!

The queso cheese had a good flavor. The waitress/bartender was friendly and courteous. We went on a Monday night so for a sports bar with a stage for a live band i cant review them on that.

The band area is on one far side of the room, so if you don&#39;t want to hear the music,  you can go to the other side of the room, where it is relatively less loud.  It&#39;s honestly still pretty loud, but it&#39;s just not as loud lol.

This was our first time at this location.
Right away out server Marvet came out to greet us and take our drink order. The drinks came out very fast. We placed our food order for a veggie sandwich, a dozen of the Cajun wings  and an order of the Sidewinder fries. Unfortunately they were out of the veggie sandwich Bummer! My daughter ordered the Poblano Bites instead she really enjoyed them. The Sidewinder Fries came out really hot which is a good thing. The Wings were awesome I wish they would have had carrots along with the celery and ranch sauce. But hey you can&#39;t have everything. I wish we could have stayed longer they were just setting up the band.
The owner came up to us to let us know it could get a bit chilly while they move in the instruments which I thought was nice of him to tell us. He offered to move us to a different table but by this time we were ready to leave.

It&#39;s a very cool place tons of TV&#39;s. Looking forward to visiting again! The food is great. Hope they have the Veggie Sandwich next time."

Couldn&#39;t figure that out given their website still up &amp; running with LOTS of excellent bands on the horizon. Excited about that. 
So all I&#39;m left to assume is problem with their phone number (at least I&#39;ll leave it at that for now since they replied on FB to assure they&#39;re open). 

NOT sure I can replicate my long review (I can&#39;t....not committed to memory of course) but I will say again, I believe place  is run by a stand-up person (probably GROUP) &amp; I can&#39;t wait to return with my LARGE group of friends. 
FYI...IF you also happen to have problems with listed phone number (again, will just assume it&#39;s a glitch this VERY minute)...know they are still open. 
And to the business, no kidding, the number needs checking. I hope this was a one-time small mixup because like me, one will assume you&#39;re closed &amp; have no choice but take group elsewhere (again, guy answering the phone told me he gets calls for you often &amp; tells them what he told me...NOT that it was just &#34;wrong number&#34; but he imagines you closed, which yeah, anyone would anyhow, even if he didn&#39;t say so).

The bands over the week night draw complete scum, complete with having to wait for a restroom on the account of people doing cocaine in the bathroom!  None of this,naturally, is a concern of the owner Chad or the one security guard they have on Fridays. Chad can usually be found in the corner with a woman every night who im assuming isnt his wife. And if you&#39;re a woman expect to have no intervention from said security guard and owners if you&#39;re being sexually harassed!

UPGRADE!!!!

M T Barrels is an improvement in every way.  

The staff are all friendly.  The food is very good.  Good live music!

Great set up - you can go sit in an area that is away from the band if you want to talk a bit (although it was very hot in that area, since it is near the kitchen).  

I&#39;ve been here about 4 times since it changed to M T Barrels.  Been happy every time.  Even went on an unseasonably hot/humid day, but they kept the temperature inside nice &amp; cool - a huge plus for us ladies that don&#39;t want to be gross &amp; sweaty when rocking out to a band.

Can&#39;t say anything bad about the place, to be honest.

Chad is one site a lot of the time and it&#39;s great to see the owners there keeping watch over their &#34;domain.&#34;  Chad and the boys TRULY GET IT!  They know how to keep the calendar scheduled with events for everyone just about every day of the week.  The set up is awesome in that you can hang out with either karaoke, jam night or bands on stage, or if you just want a good place to hang, you go to the other side to play pool, darts, video games or chill in the booths.  They have a great new menu and selections of beers and drinks!  The staff is great, my favorite being Andrea who was there through the tough times when it was Chicago City Limits.  She rocks!  

My only issue (which is nothing personal, trust me when I say this) is that the sound person needs some better training or to be replaced.  Many times, he has mics too hot or other equipment out of balance and I don&#39;t believe he gets the balance he needs to have for the room so he ends up overcompensating by jacking up the sound.  People can&#39;t hear themselves think even on jam night and that&#39;s just not cool.  Getting him some training or replacing him would make the place 100% in my eyes.

If you haven&#39;t visited for the food, a game or a band or event, I definitely recommend trying it - because you&#39;ll be going back!"

The long lines are filled with business travelers waiting to get their dinner before taking off.

My reason for docking is for two reason - the Cubana sandwich must contain a lot of salt as I was really thirsty for the next several hours. Side salad was wilted, my advice is to see if I can get a salad with dressing on the side. I was a big fan of the Rick Bayless chains, but lately, I&#39;m not having as much luck.

Never upset to fly through Chicago because I know I can sneak one of these in. If I had a really tight connection I might not risk it because I&#39;ve had 15+ minute waits for my Torta, but it&#39;s always worth the wait.

Great variety, prices are a bit above average for a sandwich at an airport, but you definitely get extra flavor for your extra dollars. Vegetarian options are both delicious - the roasted mushroom Torta is one of my favorites.

I&#39;ve never tried anything but the Tortas, but they&#39;re so delicious that I would try just about everything on the menu without hesitation. The tiny dining room is usually packed but if you can find a seat and get a margarita to go with your Torta, you&#39;ll enjoy your layover."

The bowl was generously full, the chorizo was &#34;just right&#34; in terms of spice and flavor, and I could only finish half of it before I got full. I also had a side of guac and chips, but there wasn&#39;t anything to rave about (I think Chipotle&#39;s guac is better!). 

The line may look intimidating but it moves quick! There&#39;s tight seating inside -- so if you can&#39;t grab a spot at the bar (full of different types of margaritas!), the bar by the window, or the tables, there&#39;s plenty of random tables and chairs around the airport. They also have a good selection of appetizers in addition to traditional non-alcoholic Mexican beverages. Overall, Tortas is one of the better (and unique) dining options when you&#39;re at ORD."

My friends route their flights through Chicago to just hit this restaurant on the way. My colleagues rush to the gate 10 minute before departure just to squeeze an order in at Tortas Frontera. 

Everything is delicious, made with care with local ingredients and authentic Mexican flavors. Fantastic value for the things you taste here, to make brilliant food accessible to the mass market. 

My favorites are corn and poblano chowder and the molletes (open sandwiches with melted cotija cheese). The chowder is super flavorful with a bit of kick and not too creamy, spicy accents from the poblano pepper. One can taste a slight hint of cotija cheese, along with chunks of tender poblano pepper and little bits of corn. The molletes are definitively different than anything else I have tasted with crusty thin toast on the bottom but generous with tomato sauce and cheese on top - probably much better than pizza to take on the go for the airport crowd without succumbing to a soggy pizza crust. Local ingredients are the key. The sauces and spices are there to enhance the local ingredients which are carefully picked from the local farms and proudly exhibited on the board. 

If you want to be Paleo/healthier, then ask for the chowder and the taqueria salad with chipotle chicken without the tortilla chips. The salad is the opposite of what I experienced in Dallas airport with tasteless leaves and ready-made luncheon ham slices layered on top. Here crunchy romaine lettuce is sprinkled with radishes with a bit of vinegrette and red onion, topped with slices of perfectly ripen avocado and pieces of grilled chicken in chipotle sauce. Fresh, quick, simple, on point. 

If this is in SF, I would go regularly. And it&#39;s a particular standout among chains of chains of mediocre food with wilting leaves and processed meats at the airport. 

One thing to consider: because many menu items are made fresh, ordering can take 10-15 minutes. Try to budget this in to not race around the airport like I usually do. If Chef Bayless can optimize the ordering flow at this place, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the revenue could jump by 10-15% immediately! (And to make many more people happy on a daily basis...)"

In Terminal 1 by Gate B11, the restaurant is a bright cheery spot. I ordered the Cubana sandwich, Tortilla Soup, and a side of guacamole. Prices are exactly what you expect for airport food but portions are large.

The wait time, as already mentioned by other reviewers, was extremely long. Definitely do not come here if you&#39;re in a rush for another flight - you will give yourself a heart attack and still be sandwich-less. I waited over 20 minutes for my Cubana but got my soup and guacamole side pretty quickly. In the time I was waiting, I heard two separate people abandon their sandwiches to catch their flight. 

On to the food, the Cubana torta ($12.00) was extremely smoky, salty and heavy. The meat was tender and delicious and the bread pleasantly chewy but there&#39;s a lot of very fatty bacon, mayo and cheese and a strange intense smoky taste that overpowered any nuance in flavor. In general, the sandwich fell on the disappointing side of average. 

In contrast, the Tortilla Soup ($5.00) was very disappointing. I love tortilla soup and try to get it wherever available. The flavor was decent and it was good to get something piping hot but the soup was mainly a very dark red broth with little to no vegetables and hunks of cheese that sunk to the bottom and gave the soup a really greasy feel and unpleasant texture. There were slices of avocado that a few minutes in the hot soup turned into soggy strips of fat. 

The one bright spot of my meal was the guacamole. Very fresh and well-seasoned, the guacamole was delicious even without all the add-ins. However, be forewarned, a side ($2.00) is literally about a tablespoon of guacamole, served in a little sauce container that they don&#39;t even fill up all the way.

The service is abysmal. I don&#39;t expect exceptional service in airport restaurants but it&#39;s bad when the cashier literally interrupts me in the middle of taking my order to ask a coworker how their weekend was and then proceeds to hold my receipt and change hostage in her hand some more while talking to her coworker.

All in all, Tortas Frontera was a step above many airport food stands on flavor alone but only one very small step."

Really refreshing with a tangy taste! Full of flavors with blue cheese and pickled jalapeños. But well, it is on the hot side. If you are not into spicy food, you may want rethink before ordering this. Size is pretty good as well. 

I ordered the meatball sandwich on French bread. Compared to the salad and my coworker&#39;s crispy chicken sandwich, this is mild. Tender meat and crispy bread. Should be better if had before the salad.

I switched my half sandwich with my coworker&#39;s crispy chicken sandwich. That had a stronger flavor with minced pickled jalapeño sauce. So fried chicken with this spicy green sauce, you can imagine the taste! It&#39;s seasoning is similar to the salad&#39;s, in a good way. It is also juicier than the meatball sandwich. That one is juicy, but the bread can be drier and reduce the juice of the meatball you can taste.

It is a busy airport, so a four star reviewed restaurant can be very busy. Our server was good, but you can expect the delay. When you have enough time, come here. But if you are rushing from concourse to concourse, be aware of the waiting time.

While I waited for my torta, I saw who I presumed to be the manager walking around greeting guests and cleaning tables. 

For a little restaurant that couldn&#39;t have a seating area of no more than 400 sq. ft., the overall feel was that us passengers were sitting in an actual restaurant.

It came on a single piece of bread, and had a spread of black beans, bacon, and two types of cheese. I thought it was the perfect size for a quick breakfast. My boyfriend had the chorizo and eggs torta. This is a larger sandwich, so it&#39;s not open-faced like the Mollette, but traditional. It was layered with eggs, chorizo, grilled veggies and avocado. It was definitely hearty and had all of the Mexican flavors you would be hoping for! 

The only reason I&#39;m giving this place 4 stars is because they served me my Mollette, and then we didn&#39;t get my boyfriend&#39;s  torta for 15 minutes (at which point I was already completely done with mine).

After making it through ORD&#39;s long security lines, my stomach growling, I ran smack dab into two options: McDonald&#39;s or Tortas Frontera. With those choices, I have no idea why anyone would choose the former.

Yes, it took a few minutes to get through the line and a good 15 minutes waiting on my chipotle chicken torta. And yes, the cashier was a little cranky. But the end result was worth it. Tortas Frontera&#39;s food is made to order and the fresh ingredients are exactly what I&#39;m looking for when I travel to avoid feeling gross on my flight.

You might not be able to snag a table here - it gets very crowded. But don&#39;t worry, the food is just as good sitting in front of your departure gate!

The price of my torta wasn&#39;t too bad - around $10 or $11, if I remember correctly. But the cheapest bottle of water was nearly $5. (Airports, man!)

My only other complaint is the amount of paper waste I experienced. I didn&#39;t really need the massive pile of thick, high quality napkins that were shoved into my hand along with my order... I used one of the five and left the rest in a shared space in the airport waiting area. Here&#39;s to hoping someone needed them and that they didn&#39;t just go directly into the trash unused. :("

We all know the deal. Airport food is expensive and well, crappy. We expect to pay insane amount of money for something so dull or straight up disgusting. Chicago prides itself as a good culinary town, so I consulted Eater Chicago for the best spots at ORD.

I almost got persuaded by some hotdog chain that came with free fries but I&#39;m glad I made a &#34;trek&#34; back to Terminal 1 Concourse B upon hearing Rick Bayless owns Tortas Frontera.

Even then as I waited for my food, I had reservations that it won&#39;t be as great as everyone says it is. But my god! Was I wrong?!

I ordered the Pepito sandwich which had short ribs, jalapenos and arugula. I usually hate arugula, but this is the only time I remember loving it. The service was fast and yet the food tasted well prepared.

I shall have another when I fly home next month!"

This place takes for ever (that is really the reason there is always a line). The staff always seems to be busy carrying side conversations with their co-workers rather than paying attention to their customers. 

I&#39;ve eaten here a few times: always getting a salad. The ham that is an add on for the salad is honestly deli meat, that they&#39;ve seemed to re-cook. The chicken is your best bet if you want meat. 

If you have a long lay over...stop by and sit down and people watch. If you wait a fast bite, skip this place....not worth the anxiety of potentially missing your flight."

He even showed us pictures he took of his food - and I swear, he&#39;s not even a Yelper! 

So I did what any self respecting Yelper does, I looked up all the 4 star plus Mexican restaurants in the area and showed him pictures till he figured out that the establishment he was raving about was the Frontera Grill, by Rick Bayless, of the PBS series - Mexico: One Plate at a Time. 

So when I was wandering around O&#39;Hare a couple of hours ago, killing time and getting my steps in while waiting for my delayed flight to SFO, I noticed a long line snaking around blocking my way, and looking up, noticed it was an airport version of Frontera, by the very same Rick Bayless, of the PBS series - Mexico: One Plate at a Time. 

Before I could stop myself, I was at the counter, ordering a corn and poblano chowder and a smoked pork Mollete (a warm open faced sandwich). 

The chowder was flavorful but a bit cold. It had just the right consistency, but the onions and other finely chopped veggies inside it weren&#39;t to my taste. 

The sandwich was sweet but nothing great, until I dipped it in some of the salsa they served it with. And that made all the difference. It went from 3 stars to 5 with that little move - magic! 

So just a little taste of Frontera O&#39;Hare has me looking forward to my next trip to Chicago. Rest assured my first evening back in town will find me at the downtown location of the Frontera Grill, by Rick Bayless, of the PBS series - Mexico: One Plate at a Time."

Don&#39;t know, wouldn&#39;t have picked it, but that was a slice of heaven in a rigorous travel schedule. Add in Aguas Frescas like cucumber and cilantro and I am making it a must stop each time through O&#39;Hare - perhaps even picking O&#39;Hare as an intermediate.

Breakfast options include cazuelas (subtitled as bowls), molletes, and yogurt. I said to the cashier, &#34;I would like an egg and mushroom bowl, please.&#34;  I&#39;m not sure where or how the communication error occurred, but she said &#34;We only have breakfast, no bowls.&#34;  I ordered the fully dressed yogurt instead. But the customer behind me ordered the cazuela.  I&#39;m not sure what transpired between the cashier and I--if she thought I wanted a bowl of soup, surely &#34;egg and mushroom&#34; wouldn&#39;t make sense? Plus, for the cazuela, they were out of stock on mushrooms and also out of lids for juices and agua fresca.

That said, my fully dressed Greek yogurt was very good.  It features pureed fruit on the bottom, whole milk Greek yogurt, and topped with honey, dried cherries, granola, and pumpkin seeds. Yogurt also has the advantage of being already prepped so you don&#39;t have to wait in line. If you really want to cut down on your line waiting time, you can use the Tortas Fronteras app to order ahead of time (although weirdly the app doesn&#39;t include yogurt).

I was told to visit this establishment during my brief layover in Chicago with the legendary tortas and fresh guacamole. It&#39;s always difficult to judge objectively with such strong recommendation, but its reputation, at least in my mind, was gravely misplaced for my Torta. I ordered one of the chicken tortas, expecting a succulent bite with a perfect blend of sauces and warm, freshly baked bread. What I got in reality, was a cool sandwich with very dry bread and a fairly bland chicken breast. I have had a few good tortas in the past, so this was sadly not up to par To my expectations in the very least. The guacamole was decent, fresh and I liked the very crunchy and crispy tortilla chips. Overall, for its price and reputation, I think Torta Frontera is good, but definitely not worth the price and wait, as my sandwich was no better or worse than any, run of the mill fancy panini sandwiches.

Surprisingly smokey, it had a great balance of flavor. Much better than the Pepito torta (short rib was good, but skimpy portion; the arugula killed the sandwich). Guacamole was good, but tainted by the pile of old, red onions on top.  Chips had copious amounts of salt on them; had to scrape some off (and this is coming from someone who often salts his chips in Mexican restaurants), but that was an easy fix. Prickly pear / raspberry agua fresca was like sucking on limes - extremely sour.  Review could have been a 4 considering its in O&#39;Hare.  Or not. The recipes, for the most part, are inspired (what you&#39;d expect from Rick Bayless), but the restaurant needs better oversight.  Still, only 2 good choices for food in Terminal 1 - Berghoff&#39;s and here.  Need to get back to Topolobampo downtown. Pricey, but never disappoints. 

Update to my earlier review - in addition to the Cubana torta (did I mention how good it was?), the corn and poblano chowder is also very good. Much better visit this time. Even though they were slammed (as they usually are during meal times), they were putting out the food at a good pace (much different than last time when they were all chatting it up in the back about basketball). Definitely a 4+ this time (balances out the 2 and 3 for previous visits).

Another update 7 months later - got here at 5:45 on a Thursday evening. They were out of the Cubana torta (really?), so I had to settle for something less. Waited in the long line to order and then another 20 minutes for my torta. Not sure if it is possible for them to work much slower. They had the newest (or dumbest) guy assembling the tortas.  It looked like he was reading something to tell him each ingredient to put on. And still didn&#39;t get it right. Terrible management (or lack thereof) here."

I stopped by on Friday at about 12:30pm. I stood in a short line and ordered a taqueria salad with smoked pork. To my amazement, it was whipped together right then--all the previous orders required cooking--so I had my salad in hand in about two minutes! Keep that in mind if you&#39;re in a hurry: get the food that involves no cooking.

The salad was a good size, especially for airport fare. I was a bit disappointed in the smoked pork because it didn&#39;t seem like much for the $4 add-on charge, but I still loved the salad.

Note that Tortas Frontera is right near security, and that area has a severe lack of seating between the folks getting their shoes on again and the other folks waiting at their assigned gates. You might need to walk a short ways to find a vacant chair.

I went back through O&#39;Hare on Sunday and knew where to get my food again. This time it was about 11am and there was a much longer line. My salad was again assembled fast, but a lot of hot orders came out of the oven, so the server addressed those first. I still had my food in about ten minutes. This time I ordered the taqueria salad with chipotle chicken, and I enjoyed that much more! It had whole breast pieces, cut long, and everything was perfectly seasoned. It had a pleasant kick to it, great flavor--I say that as someone who has a bad reaction to dishes that are HOT-HOT. 

This is probably about the best meal I have had in an airport--it truly stands out among the mediocre fare--and this is a place I would happily dine at if it existed outside of an airport, too. It really deserves the kudos."

I hadn&#39;t eaten all day so I also got an order or guac and chips - equally delicious.

My latest experience - I ordered a breakfast chorizo+egg cazuela, waited 25 minutes (!) for my food, and was given a chorizo+egg torta. When I told the girl, she looked at the receipt and said &#34;nope this is what you ordered.&#34; No offer to change it, apology, nothing. Apparently there was a special code on the receipt denoting if it was a cazuela/torta, but all I saw was &#34;chorizo+egg&#34; and the price, which was the same for both dishes. Otherwise, I would have probably figured out the cashier&#39;s misunderstanding/mistake during my wait. 

Anyway. It was not what I ordered. I ate it anyway, because after waiting so long I didn&#39;t want to risk missing a plane for a stupid cazuela, but I won&#39;t be back.

Then I turned to the mollete, which was pre-made and heated up.  I&#39;ve never tasted anything so salty, cheese heavy and totally lacking in pulled pork.  When I got tired of eating thick layer of cheese, I pulled it off and found only about a teaspoon (yes, a teaspoon) worth of meat--I would not call it pulled pork but rather bacon bits.

I settled on the Pepito (braised beef short rib, Jack cheese, pickled jalapeño, cilantro crema, black beans, arugula), which was fresh and flavorful. I also got a side salad that was haphazardly thrown together and not too fresh, but the torta was enough to warrant 4 stars, as this isn&#39;t a salad shop.

However, this airport rendition more closely represent&#39;s Bayless&#39; restaurant Xoco, which is the downtown Chicago fast casual torta spot. 

Here, Bayless has taken Xoco and brought it to the airport, with some overlap in the recipes and some sandwiches you can only find in the airport. The Chipotle Chicken Torta is one of those airport exclusive sandwiches, and I actually prefer it to anything served at the downtown Xoco spot. 

Anyway, enough with the history lesson. The point is, Tortas Fronteras is amazing. Incredible torta sandwiches with fresh ingredients and strong flavors. I will shamelessly admit that when given the choice, I plan my layovers through O&#39;Hare just so I can eat here. It&#39;s that good. 

Next time you&#39;re in ORD, skip the McDonald&#39;s next door and grab yourself some food that will blow your mind. (note, it can get crowded, so leave yourself at least 30 minutes to enjoy your food here)"

I&#39;ve still only been for lunch or dinner, so I can&#39;t comment on the breakfast offerings. The chips and salsa and drinks are all awesome too!

I was &#34;wowed&#34;, not by the food, but by the crowds in front of this place! I moved on, but I knew someday I would get a chance to give it a try. Finally, when my flight was cancelled the other day, I took another look and it was NOT  busy. Yay!

I did not want to order the wrong thing, so I inquired about the mushroom torta. The woman taking orders suggested the chicken chipotle   torta without meat,  and said they would just put on extra of the all the other stuff in it instead of the chicken. I ordered the raspberry-prickly pear water too. The food takes ten minutes because they actually make it for you. 

I thought the drink was OK, a bit sour side, but I finished it fast, so I guess I liked it well enough. The sandwich was very good. Excellent bread. Really, really good, and I say that being a person who actually cares about bread. Overall, the sandwich filling was a just a bit spicy for me. I was wondering if the inside of the chicken pieces adds just a little more cool, ordinarily. I decided next time I would ask for extra avocado, even if I had to pay more or get some guacamole as a side.  

I returned to ORD  the next morning, and to Fronteras Tortas as well, for breakfast. Again, it was not crowded. This time I had the Tortas Rajas and a lime water. I liked the lime drink. It was a bit like a virgin margarita though, so how could you go wrong? I got the food &#34;to go&#34; and elected to take in on the plane. It was spicier than what I normally eat, but even cold (since I did not eat it right away), it was excellent. 

The place is not cheap (9.00 for a breakfast sandwich) , but nothing is cheap at the airport, and, at least,  this is quality food. If I were to some up the food in a single phrase it would be spicy, but good. Hands down this is the THE best FAST food I had ever bought at an airport.  

The restaurant space itself could be a bit larger. It would be nice if there was more room to wait for your take out, because even when it&#39;s not crowded all the luggage takes up room. There  is limited standing space close enough to hear your number called. 

I highly recommend giving this a try, and even eating it on the plane. I generally try to avoid spicy food on a plane, but this is a GOOD type of spicy. One of the best fast food restaurants around, so I am giving it a five-star rating."

Line was somewhat long, but moved rather quickly. Decided on the Pepito and tortilla chips and guacamole to share. Although the bread wasn&#39;t different than I was used to (was more like a panini), I still enjoyed my torta. It was filled with a good amount of beef short ribs that were tender and seasoned well. It didn&#39;t have too much black beans in it, which I appreciated. The pickled jalapenos offered the right amount of heat and was complimented nicely by the cilantro crema. The roasted tomatillo guacamole was really good. I like how I could find chunks of avocado in it. The tortilla chips were just okay. Fresh, but too salty for me. 

In terms of airport food, this has to be the best that I&#39;ve eaten. When traveling out of O&#39;Hare, I&#39;ll certainly be back here."

The sandwich came with a side of green salsa that helped the flavor of the sandwich significantly, since the sandwich itself did not taste like much. The bread used for the torta saved it for me. Hard and crusty outside with a nice chewy inside.

She definitely should not be the first person anyone comes into contact with when he/she is placing an order.

 I asked her for a recommendation because this was my first time eating here and she gave me a blank stare and her answer. Never have I felt so bored when talking to a person. I won&#39;t ever return here if I see her at the counter. 

Aside from that, the rest of my visit was okay. This was my first time visiting this airport. I passed the restaurant going to my gate and couldn&#39;t ignore the delicious smells coming from this place. I enjoyed the first few bites, but I&#39;ll admit the rest was a bit soggy."

It loses a star for the high cost. $13 for a moderately sized garlic shrimp sandwich with no sides included. The garlic shrimp sandwich was mild in flavor despite the promise of seasoning. The side of salsa, which is mildly spicy, adds a much needed kick.

The menu leans heavily on meat, so if you&#39;re a vegetarian or pescatarian your options will be limited. If you&#39;re a carnivore I would rate this slightly higher. 

The staff is abrasive but this is the airport and like in thunder dome, different rules apply here."

Certainly overpriced but advertised higher quality ingredients....Ok.  Stood in line to pay, then stood in the even longer queue to pick up my sandwich.  Watched the waiting crowd trying to psychically will the assembly line to feel the urgency of the impending departures.  Gave me the time to ponder the question of where they were getting their &#34;local&#34; tomatoes in Chicago in November.  I have no idea why my order came up before some of the others that had been waiting much longer.  A couple hours into the flight when I opened my box I was underwhelmed by the size, look, and taste.  Shredded beef short ribs?  I don&#39;t think so.  Now maybe it&#39;s not fair to criticize a hot sandwich when it is a cold sandwich, but this is an airport and I need something that works to-go, and I didn&#39;t see how heat was going to meaningfully improve this experience.

I decided to give this place another try, mainly because it seemed to be the only option near my gate. I tried the taqueria salad and I must say that my opinion changed. I still give it 3 stars because it is the only vegetarian option that is actually worth the price and wait. The lime-avocado vinaigrette has the perfect tang and the poblano rajas add a touch of spice, which makes for a perfect combination with the addition of the cheese and caramelized onions.  I do have to say, I wish they added in a bit more avocado. There only seemed to be 3 small slices of avocado in my entire salad. Overall I would return for the salad!"

I was ecstatic to find this little shop right adjacent to MacDonalds at around Gate B10.  I love Rick Bayless&#39; effortless manner in distilling the best of the complex and historic Mexican food into recipes for the average American on public television.  

Now this shop is his niche restaurant offering breakfast and lunch sandwiches, soups, chips and salsas, awesome Mexican cookies, and salads in the O&#39;Hare airport.  Unlike the Wolfgang Puck U.S. airport chain (available in the same B concourse but with the predictable menu from Anyplace USA), this is a unique, small, but efficiently-run spot.  You must wait for each sandwich (torta) to be prepared and toasted; it&#39;s not pre-prepared and pulled out from under a heat lamp. They offer pork, meat balls, shrimp, and roasted mushroom tortas.

At breakfast, I felt wonderful having eaten this toasted delicious hard-crusted bread with egg, avocado, grilled peppers and onions.  It was nicely presented in a take out box along with a tub of Bayless&#39; amazing smoky red chipotle? or ancho? salsa.  The ingredients are locally sourced.  A menu board lists all the local farms from which the ingredients are sourced. That makes a difference in taste to me. Very satisfying. I&#39;ve also tried their corn/roasted poblano chowder which was really delicious sprinkled with that salty Cotija (hard cow) cheese.

This beats out eating a cold Starbucks pastry any which way you look at it.  The expert cooking and fresh ingredients and special authentic zing of Rick Bayless&#39; kitchen is evident. This is not your traditional airport fast food!

I just felt lucky to have happened on this Concourse B gift from the universe. I&#39;m not giving it a 5.0, because I need some coffee, e.g., some strong cafe con leche to help me down this sandwich, and they don&#39;t offer that here. The shop offers fresh juices and heck, margaritas too.  But I was missing el cafe."

I was traveling to a conference with a friend and he told me about this place. It was situated right next to a McDonalds, and Papa does love his chicken McNuggets, so it made it a little bit of a choice. In the end, I&#39;m very glad that I was introduced to this place!

Situated next to gate B 11 in O&#39;Hare, it&#39;s a very unassuming location for somewhere that is making food this good. They serve predominantly sandwiches that range from Cubans, to vegetarian options, 2 Southwest inspired type sandwiches. Everything we tried here was phenomenal! The sandwiches range between 10 and $13 and it totally worth the price. Price.

I had the coupon a, which was obviously there version of a Cuban sandwich. The only thing it was lacking was a really good pickle, otherwise it was lights out! My buddy had a mushroom inspired sandwich which was also excellent.

They definitely weren&#39;t giving away the margaritas here has a small margarita ran him $14. On the plus side it did come in a very small cup and had a lid so he could carry it with him should he desire. Nothing better than scrolling through and airport with a margarita I suppose.

This is the sort of place that you&#39;re always on the lookout for when you&#39;re traveling. The food was phenomenal, the prices were reasonable, especially for what you&#39;re getting, and it gives you something to look forward to when you travel through O&#39;Hare.

If you&#39;re observant, you see that there are really only two contenders around and that&#39;s the Wolf Gang Puck pizza joint or Tortas Frontega. If you&#39;re thinking  like me, Wolf Gang Puck looks a little overpriced for pizza. Plus if you&#39;ve already checked out the reviews for his place on Yelp, you know that it is probably less than savory. That leaves one real choice.

I&#39;m not sure what I expected from reading the reviews of my fellow traveling Yelpers, but it was certainly a little more than what I got in return. In my humble opinion, the food here was okay, but nothing to write home about. Then again, it is airport food and I suppose that airport food deserves its own special categorical allowances. 

The line that we stood in suggests that people really love this restaurant. One reason could be the all natural locally sustained food on the menu (single handedly the best thing about this restaurant). I ordered the portobello sandwich and it was simply just okay. I felt that the bread was a bit hard and the sandwich lacked overall flavor. Truthfully, I would typically give this a 2 star rating, but I&#39;m throwing in a point for the locally grown food and giving travelers healthy food options."

You will stand in the line for 15 minutes, feel a slight case of sticker shock when they tell you the price but you will pay it anyways, wait the additional 10-12 minutes for your order to be prepared and then finally bite into the best dang torta (here&#39;s hoping!) you ever did try. The food is great when compared to general airport food, you just really have to like sauces because everything is doused in some kind of crema or salsa. This isn&#39;t a bad thing at all, but I would&#39;ve liked to be warned so I&#39;m just doing you a solid. Also beware that these sandwiches are big! I wasn&#39;t expecting it so I ordered a soup as a side and the result was me sitting in deep food coma on my flight back to LAX. 

The service is awful. Absolutely terrible. Don&#39;t expect a smile, a nod, a thank-you, idle chatter or even really basic acknowledgement that you are anything other than an open wallet to these people. If I hadn&#39;t just waited in a line for 15 minutes I certainly would&#39;ve taken my money down the way to the very friendly people at Wolfgang Pucks. And for that reason alone I subtract  two stars."

My favorite thing is actually the Taqueria salad. It&#39;s delicious and also very filling. I like to get it with the chicken, which is really well-seasoned and spicy, and with the dressing on the side. The tortilla chips add some good crunch and the avocado is awesome. The guacamole is also really awesome. Definitely get it fully dressed! It tastes super fresh and flavorful. The chips that it comes with are a little too thin for my taste, though. The tortas are okay. Thus far, I have tried the chipotle chicken torta, the milanesa torta, and the mushroom torta. Both were kind of underwhelming. They weren&#39;t bad, but they were a little bland. The mushroom torta also falls apart way too easily - needs some sauce! I have never tried the molletes because honestly they look gross. They sit out in the heated display window getting old and icky-looking, especially the cheese on top. They remind me of microwave pizzas. 

There&#39;s also a pretty good drink selection - and they even do drinks to go if you&#39;re getting on a plane! I love the micheladas, so that&#39;s what I usually get (spicy, tomato-y, Mexican beer...excellent drink), but they&#39;ve also got good margaritas."

(for the reviewer who complaint about $13/item for super high quality airport foods - he should goto mcd next door and gorged himself there instead of give this place a non deserving 3 stars review )

normally i have low expectations for airport foods. i was pleasantly surprised and my taste buds were dancing from the tantalizing tastes of fine mexican cuisine. 

it was an artistic experiences to me. 

this place is staffed properly which enables it to serve each customer with high quality fine cuisine in a super tiny airport restaurant setting that traditionally met by fast foods varieties. 

if you ever have some time lay over in the ohare - chicago airport, do walk to gate b-10 and have a meal here. your taste buds and tummies will thank you. 

highly recommended this place."

This was my second time dining here, I came in with a friend and we ordered two appetizers, a pasta, and a entree, which was how our friendly waiter recommended us to order. My friend has a small appetite, but in the end we were still not full and hesitant to place an order for another dish.

The marinated eggplant appetizer we ordered was SUPER sour, and the eggplant didn&#39;t seem to be cooked at all.  It was served with plain grilled bread... not a proper appetizer in my view.  

I ended up sending our second appetizer back... the chopped chicken liver crostini.  It was way too &#34;livery&#34; without much other flavor, and my friend and I simply couldn&#39;t eat it.
 
Another dish we ordered was the risotto with supposedly 2-year aged cheddar cheese and broccoli and broccoli leaves. The risotto had WAY TOO MUCH LIQUID in it, which could have meant that the rice was undercooked, but this was not the case...  the rice was OVERCOOKED.  The cheese flavor was minimal, the broccoli was almost nowhere to be seen in the dish, and the raw broccoli leaves were tough and flavorless.  

Our main dish, which we were going to split, was the Walleye fish.  The price on this item alone was $28.  All the Walleye I&#39;ve had in the past were presented as the whole fish, and I guess I assumed this would be the case at &#34;Near&#34;.  Again I was disappointed... for $28 we got a relatively small portion of fish and very little additional food items on our plate.

On top of everything else, our champagne cocktails tasted watered down.

I will say that the one bright spot in this meal was my espresso at the end.  I have to admit it was just about the best espresso I&#39;ve ever had, it had a subtle orange taste to it, and was very fresh and intense.

But, although I am an espresso lover, I will not be back to Next."

If you engage with the server and with Gaetano (the chef/owner), you&#39;ll soon feel like you&#39;re a member of the family in an Italian home, where food is love. But don&#39;t expect the stereotypical &#34;Italian food&#34; menu: What&#39;s great about Near is that the dishes are not what you would expect at a suburban Italian restaurant. They are unique and even a little challenging for some people, like what you&#39;d expect at a modern restaurant in Chicago. It&#39;s no surprise that Gaetano came from one of Chicago&#39;s most innovative and highly regarded restaurants, the one-Michelin-star Schwa. He brings that same creativity and thoughtfulness to his dishes at Near, but applies it to his version of Italian comfort food. That&#39;s what makes Near a hidden gem in the &#39;burbs. It&#39;s a place where you will find interesting and even whimsical dishes that are also satisfying as food - in a casual atmosphere and without having to drive into the big city.

If you go to Near for the first time expecting a typical Italian place in the suburbs, you might be disappointed, simply because your expectations might get in the way of appreciating the experience. You need to go to Near more than once, try different items on the menu, get to know the chef and servers, and above all open your mind to food that you might not expect at a strip mall in Barrington.

Eggplant was certainly unique and the cured fluke compliments of the chef was also a good touch.  The shrimp consisted of 5 pieces of surprisingly overcooked shrimp in a sauce that was a bit salty.  The rigatoni was solid and the red crab with it was appreciated... though a bit on the heavier side.  The red snapper while crispy on the outside was definitely dry in the inside but the parsnip and sunchokes complimented it well.  The bread that came with the shrimp and eggplant were quite on opposite ends of the hard and soft spectrum and not particularly memorable at that.   I did mention to the chef (or I think it was the owner) about the first two dishes and my quips though he didnt have much to say really.   The dessert menu didnt really catch my attention so we passed on that.

Service was also quite slow.  The waitress didnt fill our waters until we asked and one of them nearly spilled the eggplant container of oil on me had I not caught it.  Maybe the food was inconsistent because it was the end of the night or they were busy but for 80 bucks for 4 plates (2 apps 1 pasta and 1 entree), I would have liked to see a better effort.  The ingredients are there, concept good and I want to support local places but I had a hard time justifying this one based on this experience.  I think the mere fact that there arent a lot of places like this around might warrant a second look but Ill have to think long and hard about this one. 

Based on how busy things seemed I can only hope this was an off night for them."

First when we arrived the place was almost empty (we made a reservation for 7pm on Saturday evening) but it filled up in a blink of an eye. Our server was very assisting .The good thing is that you can bring your own wine but be aware of $15 corkage fee. They do not have amus bouche before you start your dinner which is a little bit odd for Italian restaurant as they usually greet you with bread and olives, but I do not complain about it. We got little bread toasts with chicken liver and summer truffles which was very interesting. Then we tried octopus which was good but not phenomenal, a little bit too salty and more broiled than grilled and kumquats shaving did not break that saltiness evenly. Now homemade gnocchi --delicious and we definitely come for more.Last course ravioli was remarkable and best dish so far in Near that we tried. Served with small bay scallops and carrot puree definitely a dish to remember. Overall it is a nice, cozy place to try good Italian food."

I attended with a group of people and we tried just about all of the dishes on the menu! A few favorites - the shrimp starter with bread pieces to soak up all the garlic, tomatoes and other delicious ingredients tasted great and looked amazing as it was served up in its own little crock. All of the pasta dishes tasted as though they were made with the utmost TLC and all of the ingredients were very fresh. We also had the short ribs which could be cut with a fork, they were not only tender, they were flavorful too. 

Our server was attentive to us and let our group sit and chat for quite awhile without any pressure to get the heck out! I also like that he encouraged us to place our whole order at one time so that he could bring out the food in a recommended tasting order. Really great service here."

I&#39;m not sure that is entirely the correct rating as my wife and I were equally confused on the entire experience.

Everyone goes to restaurants for different reasons.  Personally, I like the appropriate harmony between food, service and ambiance.  I still can&#39;t figure this restaurant out.

My wife and I had two house drinks, a shared appetizer and two main courses.  With tip, we were over $100.  Now, that doesn&#39;t bother us if everything is great.

The food was inventive and unique.  We enjoyed all 3 dishes.  The portions were okay... not too large, not too small.  But, for a $50 per person dinner, I&#39;d like to see a little more atmosphere in the restaurant.  It was pretty sparse and felt a little more like a $15 per entrée bistro.

As for the service... it was very pleasant.  But, not at the level you would expect for the prices on the menu.  Same comment as above. They waitress that served us would be awesome in an inexpensive French Bistro.

Bottom line for us.  We enjoyed the food and we are glad we went.  We won&#39;t be back as there was nothing that stood out for us.  And, for what we were paying, we could find something similar for about 25% less.  

We say, try it.  Decide for yourself.  Perhaps we&#39;re a little too snobbish"

The toast on the mushroom dish was a tad black in places, the bread offerings were a bit clunky and werent as varied as i would love in a perfect world (maybe a pita, home made cracker or biscuit couldve livened things up with our appetizers) but im really splitting hairs here. It was pretty impressive. Delicious. They even gave us off menu marrow bones. Nommmmm. I really loved it. Our whole group did. The dining room is spacious and comfortable, the drinks were fresh and thoughtfully crafted, the service was good, the pasta portions were affordably large enough to fill a person up and the desserts were delightfully experimental and differently thought provoking.

Everything I&#39;ve written previously about Chef Gaetano &amp; his lovely gem of a restaurant still holds true.

I love how he changes little things up on the menu to keep it interesting for regulars.  The tried and true faves are still there and some others have a new twist.  For example, last night we ordered the Arancini as a starter.  I saw &#34;peas&#34; listed on the menu in the description this time.  Oookay, that&#39;s new and sounds a bit odd.  But then I tried &#39;em and OMG what a nice springtime addition!  The peas inside the Arancini gave it just a little burst of brightness in the taste mingled in with the delightful crunch of the outside contrasting with the creamy cheesy velvety texture of the inside.  So good.

The other tasty new twist  was the pureed swiss chard added to the ricotta filling for the ravioli.  Wow.  Again, it added a wonderful springtime brightness &amp; flavor to what could be a very heavy dish.  Partner that with the light cream sauce it&#39;s in, the pureed beets &amp; the sprinkling of candied walnuts and I was in ravioli heaven!

I love absolutely everything on the menu!  Thank you, Chef Gaetano &amp; staff,  for continuing to make it always a fabulous experience.

P.S. - if you prefer white wine over red and will be enjoying pasta the 2010 Fiorano Trebbiano D&#39;Abruzzo is amazing with all the pasta dishes, in my non-wine-educated opinion."

Service &#34;A&#34;--very nice waitress, knowledgable and full of suggestions without being pushy. 

Appetizers are delicious. Try several and share ! Excellent meal.  My beau and I both tried different specials and shared. Both were delicious. 

Double date, not rushed, ample space between tables.  Very comfortable atmosphere. 

The bar area is &#34;cool&#34;. Great area to wait while they prep your table.

I had the duck and it was perfect! My wife had the chicken and she loved it! I had a piece of her chicken and it was cooked perfectly. The wine selection was adequate but a little deeper selection would be perfect. I found the staff professional and friendly. The restaurant is small and very clean. When we were there it was 90% full and not noisy. We can have a low volume conservation with out issue. Executive Chef Gaetano visited each table to ensure everyone was enjoying their experience! The only criticism I have is that they have swing waiter (Chef did this when he was not busy) and Chef not yell out when orders are up. These two items are really stretching issues..

Tucked in a strip center in downtown.  In short, Chef Gaetano Nardulli creates dishes that are well executed, tasty and creative.  The starters are absolutely sharable.  Pastas are fresh and delicious.  

Chef Gaetano made it a point the night we were there to come out and speak directly with every guest and thank them and ask how they enjoyed their dinner.

I would give this restaurant 5 stars if they would put a bit more attention to decor.  The room is laid out a little funny and kind of blah.  But that&#39;s being picky.  Come for the food and the service.  You will be hard pressed to find anyone else doing anything this creative anywhere else in the NW suburbs."

We had the fried chickpeas and burrata as starters. Then I had the pappardelle and my husband had the gnocchi. The food was amazing and simple. The fried chickpeas were addictive. Great texture, a bit on the salty side, but something that went quite well with my beer. The burrata was deliciously creamy and was awesome on the freshly grilled bread.

My husband said the gnocchi was the best he&#39;s ever had and gave me a guilty look when I asked if he liked it better than my ricotta gnocchi that I make for him. I tried it. I&#39;ll admit, this was better, but mainly because they put some very tender pieces of pork shoulder in the dish.

My pappardelle was simple, the Italian sausage in the dish was almost too spicy, but went well with the escarole in the dish, which gave the dish a spicy, bitter, unique flavor. I liked the gnocchi better, but devoured my pappardelle.

We skipped dessert, but I&#39;m certain that if we had indulged ourselves to the max, we wouldn&#39;t have been disappointed with dessert either. Definitely a place we&#39;ll be going back to on a regular basis. If we limit ourselves to one starter and one pasta dish each, it should be a reasonable meal.

If you go, make sure you chat Gaetano up. He&#39;s got a great personality and was very attentive and made sure we were enjoying our meal.

Addendum (6/2/16): Been back here a few more times and am here again tonight. Had the Amish chicken with barley and egg yolk tonight. Holy crap, that was an amazing dish. It honestly could not have been better. So much flavor, such great texture and juiciness in the chicken. Gaetano and his staff definitely know how to prepare a meal and give you a memorable experience.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever enjoyed myself at a restaurant on a more consistent basis than this wonderful gem."

The problem comes with the portion size.  This place needs to make a decision- are they a small plates place or not?  And if they&#39;re not, they need to at least double their portion sizes.  I had the ravioli and the bolognese and still wasn&#39;t full. 

Service- service was good but the atmosphere was weird because the windows were half open, which means the top of the restaurant was dark and the bottom was light.  

I would probably not come back because I just wasn&#39;t satisfied when I left."

The lighting was good and helped to set the mood. The service was great. The people working there were very personable.

We started out with a bottle of sexual chocolate red wine. I don&#39;t remember the exact name. The name of the wine helped to break the ice a little bit. I&#39;m not much of a red wine type of person, so I&#39;m not qualified to comment on it. I&#39;m trying to acquire the taste since red wine is healthier than white.

The food was good and I recommend trying this place. It&#39;s like an Italian tapas place where you order multiple small dishes and share them. We had arancini, fried polenta bites, marinated eggplant and Gnocchi. That was a lot of food for two people, but definitely worth it. Both of us liked the polenta the most and I thought the Gnocchi was just as good. The arancini balls were okay, but nothing great. They were a little bland. The eggplant was different. It is marinated for four days I think they said. I think it&#39;s marinated in an oil/vinegar blend. It comes with bread and lettuce. They serve it in a little glass jar and looks like something you would find in a science lab. It was worth trying once, but not good enough to order again in my opinion. 

Being in Barrington, I thought the place would be nicer inside. It&#39;s pretty small. The chairs were comfortable from what I remember. The tables are cheap. We had a wobbly table that was very noticeable. I can&#39;t believe they sat us there. I made a subtle comment about it and the guy tried to put something under the leg of the table. When he couldn&#39;t fix it, he said he would take care of our bill. I told him that wasn&#39;t necessary. He gave us a $50 gift certificate at the end of the night, which was very nice of him. He was also the same guy who greeted us when we walked in, nice guy.

My date, Susan, saw the cook lick a serving spoon in the kitchen. Hopefully that was the last time he used it that night.

Every business has flaws. I don&#39;t like to have to point them out, but they are facts, so am I supposed to just ignore them?"

Near is another suburban faux fine dining spot which would be out of business in a month in NYC or Chicago. The room lacks character and is about 3x larger than it needs to be, which erases any of intimacy they were trying for with the dim lights and minimalist decor.

Service was inattentive and borderline rude. Mostly indifferent though. Our server stopped-by regularly, just long enough to spit-out the next question in the drink-eat-pay progression.

Another lowlight, the cheap-ass white wine pour. 1&#34; in the bottom of the glass? Please. This isn&#39;t 1978 Montrachet we&#39;re drinking here.

The appetizers were mostly middle of the road (Eggplant, Burratta, and Octopus) - underwhelming across the board. The cheese was the best of the 3... it&#39;s melty cheese &amp; some kinda toasted bread.

Wifey had Gnocchi which was anything but pillow-y. Meh.

Chicken entre was fine, albeit probably too salty... but you wouldn&#39;t notice because it&#39;s paired with the most disgustingly oversalted Broccoli Rabe ever. Really, it was gross.

This place is a pass."

We arrived about 7:30pm on a Saturday night.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, which we agreed to, so it gave us time to assess the menu as well as the restaurant itself.  
After 5 minutes, both of us decided it wasn&#39;t worth the wait. We were very surprised at the lack of decor in the entire restaurant and lounge.  I&#39;ve seen low scale coffee shops that look more appealing than this place!  The first think you notice about the dining room is, well, the kitchen.  It&#39;s loud and very distracting.  If I&#39;m out to enjoy a meal, I don&#39;t want to be overwhelmed by the activities going on in the kitchen, and that&#39;s exactly what stuck out to both my wife and I while we&#39;re were waiting for a table.  Also, everything looked disheveled...2 empty tables had no chairs, and a few chairs were just scattered in the middle of aisle and against a wall.  Really??  
The tables and chairs looked more suitable for a local beer hall than an upscale Italian restaurant.  The menu is very limited, and although it wasn&#39;t outrageously expensive, it wasn&#39;t cheap either.  Pasta dishes were around $13 and the house specialties were $24 and higher.  And when the servers came out with the food for a particular table near us, we noticed how small the portions were.
Ok, we didn&#39;t eat there, so I don&#39;t know how good the food actually is.  But we ended up going to a different restaurant that offered great food and service and the ambiance was so much better than this place...and probably for less money.
Sorry folks...just don&#39;t see the appeal here."

My husband took me here for our anniversary dinner, and I was so impressed.  It really looks like it&#39;s not a big deal.  It&#39;s in a strip mall, and the interior decorating is totally boring.  However, the food is exceptional.  It seems that their menu changes seasonally (I could be wrong), but they offer some fun specials too.  I went into it with a totally open mind, and I&#39;m happy I did.  I tried foods that were so interesting.  YUM, guys!  Don&#39;t miss out!"

Go try for yourself.  The burrata cheese appetizer will floor you, it&#39;s amazing.  I&#39;ve been here about 6 times and have just an awesome culinary experience.  I&#39;ve almost tried everything on the menu and have yet to be dissapointed.  I&#39;m so glad this place is walkable from my house.

The chef here creates magic.  The drinks are a plenty.  The polenta bites are so great.  Everything is so fresh.  It&#39;s nice to go to a restuarant where the chef comes out asks how everything, shakes your hand, thanks you, and remembers your name.  The guy is solid.

This is a must if your in a 50 mile radius.  People have found out about it and reservations are a must on weekends.  You won&#39;t be dissapointed."

We had attempted to get in on a Friday night two weeks ago.  Called around 6:00 to see how long the wait was - nothing open &#39;til 9:30.  Discouraging, but a good sign.  So we decided to go by on a Tuesday and had no problem getting a table.  The only reservation we have at all about the place is one that others have noted ... the decor, despite being tasteful and modern, needs some texture.  Even some more tables would help it seem warmer, but I doubt that the kitchen could handle the extra capacity of the new tables. Maybe some high-back fabric covered chairs or something along those lines.  Chef seems to have figured everything else out so I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll tweak something about the decor based on everyone&#39;s input to get it to the next level.

The three of us each ordered an appetizer, entree and dessert, with assistance from our very helpful and friendly waiter.  The eggplant is incredible (didn&#39;t expect to love pickled eggplant, but it is soooo good) as are the shrimp and the grilled calamari (the anchovy touch is perfect).  The best part is that none of these are prepared as you would find them commonly (boringly?) prepared in every other restaurant.  

As we moved through the entrees and dessert, we got too full to continue - but did anyhow.  Every last morsel, gone!  The flavors of each dish were full and wonderful.

When eating at a place like this that has such great diversity of flavors, I highly recommend dining with friends or family - those who are willing to eat family style.  We each had tastes of nine unique and very palate-pleasing dishes in this fashion.

If there were a 4-1/2 start choice, that&#39;s where I&#39;d be - just due to the fact that the ambiance needs a bit of work.  Seriously though, if that&#39;s the biggest problem, then this is a place that I expect is going to get busier and busier - so give it a shot while you can still get a table (weeknights).

If you don&#39;t know the area, make sure you get good directions from someone who knows their way around.  It&#39;s one of those &#34;inconveniently located&#34; spots that has its entrance from a courtyard that doesn&#39;t front to any street - so you have to work your way into the courtyard-style parking lot to find it.  Street visibility would definitely drive this place over-the-top busy, so maybe this is a hidden blessing for those of us who hope to return and actually get a table."

Slightly longer review: We went here the night after Thanksgiving about 7:30.  Having just finished the pub quiz at McGonigals (note to self, review bar and pub quiz) my brain was no longer a functioning instrument, so this review is only &#34;slightly longer&#34; than the one above.  We didn&#39;t have a reservation.

The restaurant wasn&#39;t full.  This alone made me hate the suburbs.  There should have been a wait for a table at that time on a Friday.  But enough about why the suburbs are awful.

We went with a few small plates to share.  The burrata was excellent, the balsamic and tomato jam giving the dish some nice acidity and sharp flavor to cut the creaminess of the cheese.  The crostini with chicken liver was nicely whipped and a little bit of black truffle gave earthiness to the dish.  Fried polenta was nice, but nothing out of the ordinary.  In retrospect I really need to quit ordering any and everything with the word &#34;fried&#34; in it if I want to live past 40.  Knowing Chef Gaetano&#39;s history working at Schwa with their awe-inspiring quail egg ravioli we had to try the ravioli dish.  I am cast no aspersion when I say that the Near ravioli was not as life-changing.  However it was a very solid pasta.  The use of peas and radishes to add lightness was welcome. 

Service was very friendly, and the fact that Chef Gaetano remembered us from dining at Schwa was mind-boggling as I need 20 minutes to find my keys every morning.  If I lived anywhere close to Barrington this would be THE must-visit place.  As it is I hope to find a few more chances than before to get out that way and try the rest of the menu.  This is a warm, comfortable place to eat excellent food."

I&#39;d like to preface my criticism with I enjoy a lot of different cuisines, and have spent some time in Italy. I&#39;d like to think I have a decent understanding of what makes a good restaurant and what doesn&#39;t. I do take exception to someone calling another person childish names if they don&#39;t agree with their opinion (Tom B.). At the end of the day it doesn&#39;t matter if only a small few like a place, this restaurant will succeed by catering to a larger audience, not the few. Watch an episode of Restaurant: Impossible sometime....

On to my review:

Things I liked: 

The decor was nice if a little bare, the welcome from the wait staff was great, and it was very roomy on the dining side. Unfortunately the roominess and lack of more decor made the space feel somewhat clinical/masculine, and lacked some warmth.

During our meal the owner/chef came out to check on the whole restaurant and was very nice and amenable. You couldn&#39;t help but want to help him to succeed. Too many places that we visit (ESPECIALLY when they are new) don&#39;t bother to connect with their guests. A cardinal sin in my book.

Parking was NOT an issue at all and the place was well signposted and easy to find.

We arrived at a quiet moment with our 7 year old, and everything was great at first.

Things that I didn&#39;t like:

The menu was a lot smaller than I would have liked. One reviewer correctly stated that there was 1 Fish, 1 Pork, 1 Beef, and 1 Chicken entree. The fish in question was not identified. I think they could have added a few more options with similar ingredients without too much extra cost to the restaurant.

The overall concept (which is based on the Italian concept of eating for a long time and sharing lots of small dishes) works out to be very pricey if you have an appetizer each and entrees each. Comparative to Francesca&#39;s across the road the overall meal worked out to 30% more than the equivalent there. Wine was excessive at $11 for a mediocre white wine.

I like the appetizer plates, but they were a bit too oily for my wife.  We had the mushroom on crostini, shrimp with focaccia, and chicken fried meatball appetizers. Overall I&#39;d have to say 4/10 there on that round.

For main entrees we had tagliatelle bolognaise (not very nice - salty), gnocchi pork (we all really like that), and the risotto (over salty and too wet).

We read the reviews here on the desserts and wanted to try out the chocolate dish and the deep fried cheese dish with vanilla sugar. Unfortunately for me the cheese dish was very dry and slightly overcooked. The chocolate dish was well presented but the tastes were too conflicting and didn&#39;t come off for my wife who is a chocoholic.

Service started to die off once the place got busy and moving (about 30% capacity) and our overall experience took close to 2 hours from start to finish through waiting.

The chef owner asked us if everything was ok several times (big plus for him) but failed to offer any alternative when our risotto went back mostly untouched. He said he knew it was salty because of the fish roe, and never offered another dish to make up for it. Good customer practice imho.

So overall I would say 7 for effort, but 2/3 for execution, with food being 2/3. 

Before other reviewers start attacking my palate or accuse me of being an Olive Garden groupie, I loved a small restaurant that we used to have in Barrington called Eclectic and were there 2-3 times a month. That was a gastronomic delight. I hate most chain restaurants. I think that with some tweaking, some regular movement of the menu (some reviews on here mention the same dishes I had and the reviews are over a year old which means the dishes are the same and no movement), and a little more work on the decor, NEAR could be a gem, but for now, we will not be going back for a while.

We wish the owner success and hope they read this."

The food is so fresh and plentiful that we awaited each course  with anticipation. Burrata with beets was nicely plated and so good with the toasted bread. It was a nice starter to share. Loved the fettuccine Bolognese. Sauce was rich but did not overpower the al dente 
pasta. Entrees of whitefish and chicken were excellent and large portions. Brought a top notch Merlot to accompany dinner. Corkage is a reasonable $15. Service is not polished but friendly and unpretentious.
Would like to see stemmed wine glasses to kick up the atmosphere a bit. 
All in all, this place is a winner."

As some have said, the decor is, shall we say, spartan. But spartan is an aesthetic, and if country lodge taxidermy or Holly Hobbie frilly is your dilly-O, you might be let down.  As hip suburban wannabes, the wife and I fit right in. 

The food is spot on. I&#39;ve lived in Borington for most of my life, but I&#39;ve also traveled a bit, and I&#39;m a bit of a gourmand myself, and I found myself saying to the Mrs. During the appetizer &#34;I&#39;ve never had favors like this in Barrington before&#34;. 

I love Ciao Baby just around the corner, and they are still the kings for comfort Italian and value, but they don&#39;t have a full bar, which has stopped me from doing dinn there about twenty times since they opened. 

When ya wanna drink, ya wanna drink!

NEAR has a not only full, but interesting bar. We&#39;ll be back."

We arrived at a fairly empty restaurant and were seated immediately. We were greeted by our server, whom was the only server for the whole restaurant that evening. We ordered our drinks and he went over the menu in full detail, which was very helpful being that it was our first time there. We ordered a few appetizers which were very tasteful. 

Our appetizers arrived shortly after ordering them, but having one server and no bus boy our empty, dirty plates sat at the table for a good 20 minutes. Our server neglected to come by to see how the appetizers were, refill drinks, or clear the plates.
When our server returned, he asked my husband if he would like another drink from the bar, my husband wanted a specific beer that they had on the menu. They unfortunately didn&#39;t have that beer because they hadn&#39;t received there beer delivery in a week and a half (seems a little fishy to me). Oddly enough, we look over at the table next to us (which were clearly regulars) and they had some of the beer that my husband ordered sitting at the table, interesting. 

We finally ordered our entrees and it took a good 40 minuets to receive them. At that point we were ready to get the check and leave. Upon receiving the entrees we were both so disgusted by the way the restaurant was run, we ate and then wanted to leave immediately. 

Being a very observant person that I am, I noticed that the Chef/Owner had gone to every table which it looked like most of the tables were regulars. You would think being a new customer he would have stopped over at our table to introduce himself, but that was not the case. I feel as though he was so busy schmoozing with the tables that all food orders went in around the same time, that he got backed up. They were understaffed in all aspects of the restaurant. 

You can find good food any where these days, but what makes a restaurant memorable that brings people come back is the service, which was horrible."

The rating for the review was mostly for the service, this place stood out for how poor it was. WE were rudely stared at when arriving at this empty room by a hostess that seemed to be bothered by people. We have never had such a clueless server either. Maybe it was her first day but the bus boys should have taken her job because they were the only good thing about this place. We waited 20 minutes for a check after we asked for it. The food was decent but nothing special especially for the price. I felt I was being upsold to order a 10 dollar appetizer. 20 bucks for two drinks was a bit over the top as well. Will never, ever come back here. The only way this place got the high reviews could only possibly be from people that have never experienced better cuisine or they all know everyone that works here. Awful service"

Heard good things from other friends, so with a snowstorm on the way and the desire to get out of the house, we called for reservations, and snagged a table.

We decided to stick with the small plates so we could try several things.  The first round was the chickpeas/olives and the mushrooms.  Delicious!  The chickpeas were flash fried - nice coating on the outside and creamy on the inside.  And a generous portion.  Mushrooms were also wonderful, but had to cut them up a little to put them on the bread.  Thin slices of cheese were a nice touch.  Second round was the polenta bites and the shrimp.  Heaven!  Sauce on the shrimp was fabulous, with nice dipping bread cubes.  Polenta was nicely done with a creamy dipping sauce.  Third round - too full!  So we&#39;ll have to come back and try the others we selected!

So sad it took us so long to find this place.  Very much a foodie place.  Thought the décor was nicely done - more modern and fit with the menu in our opinion.  And noting a reviewer who wanted the tables closer together -- appreciated that we felt like we weren&#39;t sitting on our neighbor&#39;s laps.  Although funny, we ran into good friends there, and talked over the aisle.  Had a great time."

PROs: Appetizers:  The arancini were amazingly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, not greasy at all. The fried polenta bites were also very moist and tender, but definitely needed the sauce it came with. They may be bland without the sauce. Entrees:  My gnocchi with braised pork and fontina was to die for. The gnocchi wasn&#39;t gummy and dense. The braised pork and marinara sauce had unbelievable flavor - not bland at all.  My husband had the rock shrimp risotto and it was gone in about 5 minutes. My brother-in-law ordered the halibut and said it was one of the most moist, flavorful halibut he&#39;s ever had (and he&#39;s particular). My sister-in-law ordered the chicken with the scrambled eggs, potatoes, and truffle. She really enjoyed the flavor combination that the chef created. Desserts: We ordered 1 of each dessert on the menu and were overall pleased, but thought it was the least exciting of the entire night&#39;s feast.

CONs: Parking is a little hard to get to if you don&#39;t know the area. I was also bummed that Prosecco was the only sparkling wine/champagne that you could drink by the glass. The rest you had to order the bottle. They also didn&#39;t have Riesling, which should be a white wine staple. Pomegranate martinis were delicious, but seemed to have no alcohol in them whatsoever. Our server hardly smiled, which always makes you feel somewhat &#34;wah wah wah,&#34; but I&#39;ll give her props for her promptness.

Overall, the food was amazingly fresh and meticulously prepared. It&#39;s very apparent that this chef takes his food seriously. I know some reviewers though the atmosphere was bland and lackluster, but that didn&#39;t bother us because the food was astonishing. I&#39;d rather have great food and an okay ambiance than terrible food with a beautiful décor. We will absolutely be back to NEAR again!"

We typically head into Chicago, but now, we finally have an option to stay near ;) home.  

My husband and I were so intrigued by the starters that we ordered five of them, and they were excellent.  The mushrooms were heaven, LOVED the chickpeas, the burratta  cheese was creamy and decadent, and the polenta bites were creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  We also ordered a scallop special which was very good as well. 

For entrees, my husband ordered the gnocchi which had a deep, rich red sauce that reminded him of a cioppino - and he loved it.  He said the gnocchi were excellent - very tender.  I ordered the risotto which was unlike many I&#39;ve ordered as it was served in a delicious creamy sauce - we would both order our entrees again. 

Nicely stocked bar for martini&#39;s, wine list was nice, and the beer list had several craft beers to choose from.

We were quickly disappointed.  We found the decor to be cold, service slow, and food ok especially for the price.  You are encouraged to order small plates and pasta to share and then a main course for each person.  Each of these items are reasonably priced but when you order the amount the recommend it quickly becomes pricey. 

We ordered the polenta bites, which were ok, the crostini, and the croquettes,  which were basically breaded and fried sausage bites, something you could get at any pub.  For our pasta course we ordered the fettucine bolognese, tortellini, and the risotto.  The first two were average and the risotto was too al dente and runny.  Our main courses pork, halibut, and ribeye were good but average.  This restaurant doesnt  not serve bread on the table but were very happy to accomodate the request but we were served very bland dried out foccacia. 

I had high hopes for the restaurant but found the food to be average at best.  Maybe when some kinks are worked out I will return."

Went there with my family from out of town which included two picky kids. Atmosphere was very warm with lots of dark woods, feels slightly more upscale but very comfortable (we were dressed in jeans and t-shirts trying to stay cool in the 100+ weather).

They&#39;re promoting small plates, which reminds me of tapas. Seems to be set-up so that you can do courses, so all the portions are not typical restaurant portions. Prices are very reasonable appetizer course $6-$11, pasta course $10-$12 and entree course $18-22. Our table shared a bunch of appetizers including Confit Shimejii Mushrooms, Shrimp in a creamy garlic and herb sauce with roasted tomatoes and Burratta Cheese. If you have never had Burratta cheese I definitely recommend that you try it immediately! Its fresh mozzarella infused with cream, this was utter heaven and imported directly from Italy according to the Chef.

I have a gluten allergy so I wasn&#39;t able to try the bread or pasta, but my mouth was watering as everyone at my table devoured theirs. The server came around to our table several times offering fresh focaccia out of the oven. The picky kids enjoyed Risotto and fresh pasta with marinara sauce. My aunt raved over the Spaghetti alla chitarra that had grilled octopus, asparagus and fresh herbs.

I really liked the concept of the small plates, this way you can try a little bit of everything that sounds good on the menu. The menu is on the smaller side, but if you do something you should do it well and that seems to be what NEAR is aiming for. I did suggest that the Chef look into some rice pasta for us gluten intolerant people. 

Almost forgot...I had the meanest pomegranate martini. Check out NEAR. Support local business!"

I asked for a red wine to go with my pasta but received a white.. thought I&#39;d try it, maybe it&#39;d pair and I just didn&#39;t know it? But no luck.

Then she comes out literally 12 seconds later with a cold sampler appetizer platter and says &#34;do you want it?&#34;  The pompass owner then comes to table and says that&#39;s just the way it is on Fridays.  Deal with it.  Wow. What a horrible way to treat customers. I was really taken back by his response but I&#39;m sure this business will fail like the previous three before it!!!  Get a clue.

Window booths are cold and drafty.

Food is not bad but $10+ for a burger (w/o additional condiments).  They charge extra for a condiment.  Yes, a condiment.  They call it a topping and compare it to bacon or tomato.

I&#39;m just not a fan of cheese on my burger.  I requested to omit cheese but, ordered mayo for my tomato and lettuce.  They charged me extra for the mayo.  And no, they didn&#39;t reduce the bill for no cheese even when I questioned the mayo charge.  Hello."

Professionalism gets thrown out the door when me or any of my friends are here not having any issues at all.  Attitude when ordering drinks, lackadaisical drinks at that because we are the ones placing the order, and EVEN will SKIP the songs we play on the digital jukebox here because they know we played them. Songs we PAID for, that your business gets a cut of. I&#39;m typically a fan of this small town, nice sports bar but when your bartender can&#39;t differentiate between work and personal life, that becomes an issue.

So we met here on a Friday night for dinner, drinks, and darts. The only problem I had was that the dart board was located right next to the bar access point. Waitresses were really getting annoyed with us because we were in their line of serving. But other than that, we had a great night.

There is a digital jukebox, which we basically controlled all night. Some of the male patrons got a little grabby, but we can handle ourselves. This might become our new regular spot, now that Dirty Nellie&#39;s has gone to the overpriced dogs."

Im close enough were I walk home but cant throw a rock at it.

Menu is a pretty typical bar food w/ some greek choices.  I decided to go w/ the &#34;most popular chicken pita&#34;  it was something like that, whole point its so cliche when places call out their infamous sandwich.  Its common sense that your best dishes are always on the top of the list...

Anyways the chicken pita was simple but cooked perfectly.  It came w/ grilled chicken flavoured well and not dried out, red onion, tomato, tzatzzi sauce (spelled wrong, I know im not greek), and loaded w/ feta!    Of course fries over salad.  The pita was full of flavor with every freakin bite!   Fries were just ok, nothing special to them.  But the pita sandwich was simple but tasty!!  

The decor after the remodeling is great.  In most cases I go here to catch a sports game which this place has a tv at every angle or to grab a drink before doing something.

PS - Serving 312 on tap for $4.50 as a special is absurd. 

PSS - Thank you for switching our grumpy ass server out with someone who loved to chat, Megan I believe. Sure she rambled a bit but she was at least prompt, attentive and deserving of a good tip. Had Princess Angry Ass waited on us our experience would have taken a much faster turn for the worst.

They had a good selection of sandwiches and burgers on their menu, with typical prices around $8 give or take.  I ordered the chicken, bacon and 2 cheese panini, which was very good.  It came with fries (which were nice and crunchy, not soggy) and a pickle slice, which I feel is a necessary staple as a side for a sandwich.  It feels like a place for the locals, but I definitely like the look of the inside so they can rest assured that their remodeling efforts did not go to waste.

I&#39;m kind of hoping it will stay an undiscovered gem for just a little longer. Their food deserves to be known. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and all natural wood. It&#39;s a very classic log cabin atmosphere. It&#39;s classy yet casual.

With each meal, you receive unlimited soup refills and crusty bread with szmalec, a rendered pork fat spread with bacon or similar flavoring inside. It&#39;s heavy but a welcome change from the usual butter and very tasty. I tried a vegetable soup as well as mushroom soup. They kindly allowed me to switch varieties between my servings of unlimited soup. The service is friendly and fast! On game days the place is lively and filled with cheering fans.

I ordered chicken with roasted potatoes and beef stroganoff, which isn&#39;t like the Northern European version but more like a Hungarian goulash. Chicken was delicious and crispy skinned but perfect texture inside. The beef was delicious, cut into bite sized pieces, and tender. Plenty of food to take home to re-enjoy later. The goulash was served in a cute little suspended steel cauldron. That was a fun touch.

This restaurant deserves a lot more exposure than it currently has. It&#39;s also next to Helen&#39;s Polish deli, so you can pick up some kabanosy (dry sausages) or kielbasa for grilling later."

Really interesting looking log cabin on Irving Park Rd. about 5 miles from O&#39;Hare. You&#39;ll realize how close you really are to O&#39;Hare if you ever try and sit outside on a nice day. Don&#39;t do that. 

1/2 order of steak tartare is plenty for 2-4 people and a great appetizer. Some of the best tripe soup I&#39;ve ever had. Light grainy bread is homemade fresh and warm, and the lard vs butter option should be tried at least once.

Love the Schnitzel with 3 salads, big leftovers. Side polish salad just the way its supposed to be with a sour cream dressing, fresh and sour. All fried food should have an egg on top of it. Portions are large.

Bottomless Ice Tea in the cutest Polish log cabin in Chicagoland (most real Polish Peoples and children are drinking beer), wood on the walls, everywhere. See Nancy L&#39;s mo betta excellent review &#34;designed by Woody Woodpecker&#34;.  We are usually the only non Polish speaking people there. They will answer the phone as well as address us in Polish if they are looking at my partner who is half Polish. I look like the people that marched through Poland. Our last fantastic waitress Justina was wonderfully patient at deciphering our sad English. We have been working our way through their menu and love it and U Gazdy.

Very friendly and laid back, friendly boisterous is probably the right word for not quiet, a German rathskeller feel.  Nice easy wood bar seating and some high and low tables. The outdoor patio&#39;s nice when it&#39;s not too hot or cold and the planes aren&#39;t too low, hint the planes are always low here.  ENJOY U Gazdy."

Is it like German food?  Russian?  Ukrainian?  Can I pronounce anything on the menu?  Will I be the only person in there who doesn&#39;t speak Polish?  OMG THE STRESS.  

Now that I live super close to U Gazdy though, I HAD to finally check it out.  I mean, it COULD be our new favorite restaurant close to home, right? 

Seriously, this place is FREAKING DELICIOUS.  I&#39;ve never had Polish food before and this is some serious, stick-to-your-ribs, delectable food.  It was similar to the German specialties I have had before but with A LOT more flavor.  It&#39;s like they took German food and made it better.  And added more fat and butter.  Yum.  

They serve you bread and rendered pork fat (?) &#34;butter&#34; when you sit down right away.  That was awesome both in flavor and in keeping the baby occupied while we tried to figure out what to order.  Speaking of being nice to my baby (who was being a complete jerkstore by the way) the waitresses were all so sweet to her which is always appreciated.  The waitresses were actually all really good and helped each other out (with an additional food runner too) so everything was quick and service was really good.  But I digress...let&#39;s get back to the food.  We got the pierogis (1/2 meat and 1/2 potato and cheese), potato pancakes, the breaded veal (sorry, I am too lazy to see how to spell it in Polish), and the blood sausage (see aforementioned laziness with the proper name) and it was all AWESOME.  My partner thought the veal could&#39;ve been more tender (or something...I couldn&#39;t really hear him over my chewing and raving about the food...oh, and the jerkstore baby)  but everything else was SO GOOD.  And all the portions were so huge we actually had two meals...one dinner and one lunch the next day.  I&#39;m not going to go into too much detail because I feel like everything I ordered has been raved about in other reviews but suffice it to say if you don&#39;t eat this blood sausage dish before you die, you will regret it for all of eternity.  

I will be back, U Gazdy.  I love you and your Polish food.  The beer I will have to get used to, but the food?  TRUE LOVE."

Well, for one - I don&#39;t eat Polish food often, more like once in a blue moon.  Yes, I&#39;ve had the more common Pierogis, and stuffed cabbage, but that&#39;s the extent of my Polish adventures.

And two -  This restaurant is &#39;blink your eye&#39; and you&#39;ll miss it. I&#39;ve drove past it a hundred times and never knew it existed.  Your dead giveaway will be Helena&#39;s Polish Deli (large signage) right next door in front of a tiny parking lot..

The exterior &amp; interior is very cabin-esque throughout. Tables, chairs, walls..think Woody Woodpecker. Decent bar area with good amount of seating.  Warm, cozy and casual Euro feel.  Plenty of Polish diners when we arrived (always a good sign).  We were greeted instantly and service was spot on.  Menu items explained.  A hearty, meaty and starchy selection of traditional home style Polish fare.  

Complimentary grain bread with lard spread arrived first.  Lard was a first for me. No, I don&#39;t make a habit out of eating lard, but I was excited to taste it.  Mixed with bacon pieces and I&#39;m not sure what else.  Our waitress described it but I couldn&#39;t quite make out what she said due to her Polish accent, so I just nodded and smiled.  I can only describe it as unique and yes, lardy...its definitely worth a taste and not off-putting at all.  Just take another Lipitor if your watching your cholesterol.  I wouldn&#39;t go &#34;hog-wild&#34; on it...

We wanted to taste a variety of appetizers &amp; two entrees...so our group of three shared:

-Pierogis appetizer - serving of 10.  You can mix 1/2 &amp; 1/2 but I asked if we could try 3 varieties instead of 2.  Our server was reluctant at first but since the kitchen wasn&#39;t busy, she happily obliged.  Excellent.  Potato, Beef and Sauerkraut w/mushroom all topped with crispy bacon and served with sour cream.  Delicious.  Dough was not thick, tough or a starch bomb. Really tender. Great fillings on all but our fave was Sauerkraut Mushroom by far. This was nothing like your frozen variety - definite homemade taste..

-Potato pancakes.  Side of two.  Thin and crispy.  Flavorful.

-Beef Stroganoff &amp; Veal Sznycel entrees.  Includes your choice of Mushroom or Chicken Noodle soup.  Mushroom soup was light and satisfying.  Full of tender mushrooms in a light cream broth.  More soupy than creamy.  Delightful.

Stroganoff is presented in a tripod kettle and includes your choice of hoof shaped dumplings, potato pancakes or pureed potatoes. We all decided on dumplings and were happy we did.
EXCELLENT.  So light &amp; tender.  Homemade perfection and a great accompaniment to the copious amounts of fork tender beef contained in a meaty flavorful sauce combined with mushrooms...Take your ladle and pour a nice helping over your dumplings and you&#39;ll be one happy eater..

I will admit, this was different from the Stroganoff&#39;s I&#39;ve had in the past and described as a beef goulash. Since I&#39;ve never had goulash and can&#39;t compare, this reminded me of a beef stew in terms of flavors and consistency - but SO tasty and well executed.  Huge serving...  

-Veal Sznycel plate was (again) enormous.  Two hefty veal portions breaded &amp; fried sitting on sautéed mushrooms topped with two sunny side up fried eggs.  Includes pureed potatoes or dumplings only. Pureed potato was simple and went nicely with this heavier dish. Veal wasn&#39;t as thin or as tender as we would&#39;ve liked and lacked seasoning. Perhaps sauce would&#39;ve added more flavor to this dish.  Although it wasn&#39;t our favorite, it wasn&#39;t bad at all.  Plate also comes with 3 Polish side salads of pickled veggies.  Talk about a ton of food for one dish!  Polish peeps know how to bring it on!

Excellent selection of Polish brews..some wines and cocktails too.  Our group felt very welcomed here. Some patrons were seated at the bar when we walked in.  Clearly Gazdy&#39;s is a go-to or favorite spot for locals, non locals and Polish alike.  Huge plus on outdoor seating as well.  Everything tastes home made and nothing lacked flavor, with the exception of veal. My only complaint would be that app&#39;s and entrees were not spaced out, but came quickly after another.  

Gazdy&#39;s serves up lumberjack size portions quite authentically -  I promise, you will not leave hungry. A family of 5 could easily feast on what we ordered and leave satisfied for only $54.
Yes, $54....that&#39;s what I call a great deal, and you can&#39;t beat the quality..

Highly recommend this Wood Dale diamond in the rough when you want authentic Polish at a tremendous value..4 types of Borsch.  Duck, rabbit, goulash, pork shank, some seafood...and more.
I&#39;m full."

Every time we come here, my taste buds get a real treat. Their dishes are even better than most places I dined at in Poland! I especially love their soups, the Highlander Pancake and their complimentary bread served with lard.

If you like different foods this is your place. If you love Polish food this is your place. I am a first generation Polish American with both of my parents immigrating from the mother land. I grew up with Polish food and you will not be disappointed.

1. This place is a highlander restaurant. Highlanders are considered like what rural country woods people are considered here in America. So they are the outdoorsy kind of people in Poland. So this is not the type of Polish city people kind of place. A little different tradition and culture. 
2. With that being said, the food reflects that. The food is amazing.
3. I do think the food is a little bit expensive, but for what you get its worth it. 

I do think this is one of the best Polish restaurants around. Give it a shot!

I don&#39;t mean chains or your everyday American food places either! My parents were visiting this weekend and with St. Patrick&#39;s Day on the horizon mom strangely blurts out, &#34;why don&#39;t we find some Polish food?&#34; Um... Sure! We moved recently and I wasn&#39;t even sure where to begin! As long as I&#39;ve been with the boy (and he&#39;s the Polish in our relationship!) he hasn&#39;t taken me to a real Polish restaurant! I don&#39;t think he knew of any... Until now...

We started with the Pierogis. We have 5 each of the meat/pork  and potato/cheese. Both were fantastic! The meat pierogis had a bit of sauerkraut in the mix which gave the flavor a nice kick. The potato pierogies weren&#39;t quite as flavorful, but they had their own merit for being handmade. 

We ordered 3 meals for the 4 of us, so we got 2 Chicken Noodle Soups and a Vegetable Soup. The chicken was a bit lackluster. There wasn&#39;t much for flavor and it was quite bland. The veggie on the other hand was outstanding! Now, there is one vegetarian dish on the menu and it&#39;s not the soup lol! It&#39;s made with a chicken base, so it&#39;s a little salty. Between the base and the broccoli it was almost creamy. We&#39;ll have to go on another day next time so we can try another kind since I&#39;ve seen some good reviews of the soups.

The first dish that we all shared was the Pork Tenderloin Escallops. The pork was perfectly seared and covered in cheese that was bubbly and melty and topped with mushroom gravy! Who doesn&#39;t love seared pork covered in cheese and gravy?! They served it with potato dumplings that were handmade. I could have eaten a truckload of these dumplings with the gravy! NO JOKE! (we were married in a semi Polish ran banquet hall, and these dumplings were by far way better!)

The second dish we shared was the Polish Style Duck with Roasted Apples &amp; Raspberry Sauce and fries. The duck was good for the most part; however, it lost a lot of it&#39;s moisture. The apples and sauce helped. The boy is a duck fanatic and he loved it. I can&#39;t tell him he&#39;s wrong, it&#39;s just my opinion vs. his. Skip the fries if you order this. They&#39;re just steak fries. Get the potato dumplings if you can!!

The third dish we all shared was the Highlander Style Potato Pancake with Pork Goulash. I died happy eating this! I can say that I love potato pancakes from every country that has made them for me (except a few random breakfast places)! The pairing of this pancake and the pork goulash was a fantastic idea! The crispy edges of cake with all the gravy of the goulash were made to go together! I was the one that finished what was left on this plate!

This place has a great rustic, homey, almost log cabin feel to it. We had a couple different people visit our table to make sure we were doing alright. We were upset that we ate too much to attempt to have dessert! But we were glad we had some leftovers to take home! The dining area began to fill up as we were eating. We got there early, so we didn&#39;t necessarily need to have a reservation. If you plan on having a later meal though, you probably should plan ahead!"

She wanted to try some authentic Polish food and man this was the right place! It&#39;s a small, old style themed restaurant that has an old world-midevil theme to it. The food we had was spot on. I would totally recommend the sauerkraut soup if you want to try something new! It was one of the best soups I have had. The bread was also awesome and the peirogis were excellent as well. I had the roast duck for an entree and it was ok- not great. It tasted like a moist version of chicken and I wasn&#39;t really feeling the raspberry sauce that came with it.

Overall this place definitely earns it&#39;s 4/5 stars. Nothing more, nothing less. I would recommend to people that want to try authentic Polish cuisine!!"

Another hour lunch, another time I was late back from lunch. Don&#39;t let that discourage you, though! The food here is incredible. I ordered a Polish standard in my family, kiszka, and I was very pleased with the flavor, texture, and moisture (those of you who have had dry kiszka know exactly what I&#39;m talking about). It came with tasty potato dumplings and sauerkraut as well. The bread they serve with an entree comes with some kind of rendered fat which is probably horrifyingly bad for you, but it is also definitely worth trying.

The setting is rustic wood like you might find in a cabin. The tables are natural wood with all the imperfections, and each table has chairs on one side and a bench on the other. It worked out great for my party of two. I really liked the look of the inside of the restaurant. It&#39;s cozy and there are only about a dozen tables, so it could fill up fast in there. There were only two tables of people when we visited just after noon. 

I docked one star for timeliness as it seemed to take quite a while to get our food ordered (I&#39;d say at least 10 minutes), and also for the check. There was only one server on, but there was an older gentleman sitting behind the counter who did zero things while we were there, just sat there letting the poor server take the brunt of the lunch crowd. The entree I ordered came with a soup--but apparently not borscht (red beet soup), which I had asked for, so I was charged an extra $3.50 for a coffee cup of borscht--not a good value--and I felt rather cheated that she didn&#39;t mention the extra cost and just upcharged me. It&#39;s not like I ordered a typically expensive item expecting it to be free. It&#39;s basically beet broth (yes, beet, not beef). Even so, I would certainly return again. 

If you are Polish and miss your family&#39;s cooking, or if you aren&#39;t Polish and want to try some great Polish food, U Gazdy is definitely the place to go."

We shared a &#34;half&#34; order of steak tartar ($8.50) which is plenty for two people to split as an appetizer.  I ordered Beef Stroganoff which come with your choice of soups as a starter.  This time of year you will often find goulash soup as one of the choices.  Oh man is it good!  It is nice and spicy and will definitely warm you up.

You can order the Beef Stroganoff with noodles, dumplings or potato pancakes.  I chose the dumplings which were a delectable treat.  The Beef Stroganoff comes in a stainless steel tureen that hangs over a lit flame.  Not only was the beef and gravy cooked to perfection, there was plenty left over for a meal the next day.

U Gazdy offers Zywiec, Carlsberg and Wehenstephaner Weis beers on tap.  A 20 or 22 oz glass is just $5 and a great value.

U Gazdy serves delicious Polish Highlander food at a great value.  Their food is delicious any time of year but, with winter approaching you owe it to yourself to check them out for a great stick-to-your-ribs meal."

After 10 min of explaining and even showing them my online order from my phone, I was put on the phone with what I believe to be is their owner. 

For some reason, there was an issue with them not being able to take grubhub orders and I was not the first to have tried ordering from them. Not sure why they did not settle this issue with grubhub after the first instance but even more baffling is that noone at the restaurant acknowledged it might be their system and instead insisted I was at the wrong place/did not know what I was talking about.

If you come here you&#39;re definitely not leaving hungry as the portions are huge and the meal comes with a generous amount of side dishes. Everything here is prepared with great textures and is seasoned well. Here are my thoughts on some items:

Bread: Nice texture with a savory side of something that seems like lard and pork bits.

Soups: Chicken noodle was alright but the cream of mushroom had a nice full flavor to it with fresh mushrooms. Very enjoyable and great with the bread.

Highlander Style Pork Shanks: Pork shank was prepared well, not too salty and tender.

Rumsztyk Steak: Tenderized with a nice flavor like a tenderloin. 

Giewont Cutlet: Breading was nice with a tender cutlet inside. The ham and cheese filling was very good.

Traditional Polish Style Duck: Could be a little more flavorful but was tender and prepared well.

Hoofshaped dumplings: Light flavored and chewy, went great with entrees.

Pureed potatoes: Not very flavorful but matched quite well with the horseradish sauce.

Three polish salads: Very refreshing and fresh.

Overall, a very enjoyable meal. I am not as familiar with Polish cuisine to make detailed comments but this was delicious and inspires me to try other Polish restaurants in the area."

We took our Polish grandmother here as a surprise and she really enjoyed speaking Polish with our server, who was so very kind I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember his name.

There was a large baby shower party in the restaurant at the time so we had to wait a short time for a table but in 5 quick minutes we were seated.  Despite the large party in the restaurant our food came out quickly and the service was attentive.

We tried the pierogis (best sauerkraut &amp; mushroom ones I&#39;ve ever had!) as a starter to share.  Topped with crispy crumbled bacon with a side of sour cream they hit the spot &amp; you can choose a combo of 2 kinds on your order.  They also bring warm bread with a side of bacon drippings to slather on the bread - to those who haven&#39;t had it before it might not sound good but try it - it&#39;s delicious.  You will thank me, though your arteries may not...but it&#39;s worth a try for sure.  I do not recall the names of the 3 entrees we had but we all absolutely loved our meals.  Oh, and our meals came with a choice of soup - we all had their mushroom soup which was like a combo between a broth and  cream based soup with big slices of mushroom in it.  Oh so good!

U Gazdy is a Polish restaurant with a twist, focusing on the food from the southern region of Poland.  You might expect a restaurant like this closer to the city, maybe further east on Irving Park road but this little gem in Wood Dale is a must try.

This is clearly a Polish restaurant as we were nearly presented with the Polish language only menus.  The server quickly realized we hadn&#39;t been here before and that we were not fluent in Polish so she brought out the English menus.  The regular menu seems to focus on dinner items that were priced in the $15-$25 range but the condensed lunch menu is much more reasonable.  

This place could be hard to find if you haven&#39;t been here located on the south side of Irving Park road.  The restaurant looks like a little cottage with an all wood exterior.  The interior is extremely unique with all wood floor, tables and chairs of matching make.  

I had the U Gazdy pork chop sandwich for lunch and it was extremely hardy.  All of the meals we had that day were filling and no one was left unsatisfied.  Before your meal you are given bread with the choice of butter or lard.  This was the first time I had lard on bread and it was ok.  Not something I would practice regularly but it was worth the try.  I also had the chicken noodle soup with homemade broth along with noodles and chicken.  

Service was kind and split the check for us four ways without any issues.  It would be interesting to come here during dinner or weekend hours to have a filling meal and perhaps some drinks.  I would love to engage with the community that comes to this restaurant."

It&#39;s charming, polite, heavy and overall an enjoyable experience. The service is not always on point, they struggle when there are crowds and the food will win no rewards, yet you still walk away satisfied. Perhaps that is because you feel like you could be transferring a cold night in Chicago for one in Poland which makes it all the more interesting.

Items: Our Starters included Potato pancakes which come with apple sauce, Pierogis- meat and sauerkraut, and Potato with bacon and sour cream. Steak tartar plate
Entrees: Highlander pork shank baked in beer with kraut and dumplings, pork cutlet Stuffed with mushrooms cheese and egg, cabbage rolls Stuffed with pork beef and rice served with a tomato mushroom sauce and dumplings, and Kisha (blood sausage)  served with cooked sauerkraut and dumplings.
All in all a really good meal that left us all too stuffed for dessert. Great choice for a family dinner.
I&#39;ll definitely be making this a stop next time I am in Chicago."

In addition to our soup, we had waited an additional 20-30 min for our dinner which was supposed to come with more soup but we were never asked what we wanted. I had ordered the breaded pork chop with fried cabbage and honestly if it weren&#39;t for that cabbage I don&#39;t think I&#39;d give this place 3 stars, the cutlet was quite bland. If I could go back in time and was still craving polish food, I&#39;d drive the extra few min to scaumburg and eat at bacowka."

Either at a good Irish pub, or here, at O Gazdy!  The warmth of the decor, food and staff here was almost overwhelming...I think I fell in love with all three!

The outside of this place is, well, strange and out of place looking. Something out of a brier rabbit cartoon mixed with Yosemite Sam. Wooden logged with heavy door in front and a small parking area wedged into an area where strip malls and auto stores are prevalent. After visiting though, it makes sense. The inside is clean, and abundantly wood, again. High glossed tables with benches on one side and chairs on the other. A small bar to one side that looked inviting. Seemed like all the other customers were polish...and that&#39;s a good sign. 

Our waitress was soooo cute.  First, she brought us the menus and then asked if we had been here before. After saying no as a group, she scooped them up and returned in a blink with the &#39;English&#39; versions apologizing that she&#39;d brought the wrong ones. Maybe we all looked polish, uh, maybe not!  Brought us plenty of bread through the meal and was very helpful to us while ordering. Towards the end of our visit I&#39;d basically licked my plate clean and she stopped at the table and asked, &#39;Are you done with your meal?&#39;  It was such an honest and well meaning question, but unless I intended to eat the silver then I was obviously done. It was a great example of how polite she was. 

So, onto the food. This place is a comfort food factory. Hot plates stacked with carbs and meat with no worries about eating too much or not healthy. When you are served lard with your bread you just don&#39;t think about it and dig in. Slather it on thick because it is not as strong as you think. I had the meatballs and potatoes plate.  The balls were meaty.  Like, really meaty. I don&#39;t think there was any filler in there because they were heavy. But oh so good!  Other dishes in our group were well liked, but no one got the pierogies. :(  I sopped up the remaining gravy with some of the hard bread and was ready for an afternoon nap. 

Definitely want to return soon...maybe for an evening of a few beers and pierogies."

Servers were polite and nice. I ordered the duck polish style. It was moist and delicious. Especially with the raspberry sauce on it. Though wasn&#39;t able to finish meal cause it was a large meal for 1 person. I would comeback here again if I&#39;m in the area again."

We walked in to the highlands of Poland. At least that&#39;s what they want you to feel like. I&#39;ve never been, so I&#39;ll just agree and enjoy the feel. 

And clean! It&#39;s a must.

Our waitress was great. Very attentive and sweet. Loved her accent. Even our eating neighbors were great! 

We ordered the purified, cheese and potato appetizer. Wow. 10, so many for just the two of us. Delicious.

For our entrees we had the captains cutlet which is a breaded pork loin stuffed with cheese alongside dumplings and a polish side trio salad. And the pork tenderloin scallops which is drenched is a gravy sitting on a bed of vegetables served alongside dumplings. Both delicious. Both huge. Both had leftovers that came home with us.

We ate and finished by 7pm on Friday. Just as we were leaving it became busier.

At the end of the night our eating neighbors informed us they were on WGN, Voted best of Chicago. I CAN SEE WHY! We&#39;ll be back."

But, this is far from your typical Polish restaurant. Last night, I took a small party to U Gazdy, some of whom were fans of Polish food and others probably a bit more reluctant. 

I ordered the roast duck. It came with cabbage soup, some potato wedges and some chopped salads, one of which was beets. I eat most anything, but beets are my all-time least favorite food. The very attentive waiter brought out the cabbage soup and it was delicious. Then came the chopped salads, and I loved them too, even the beet salad. Finally, I dug into the roast duck -- and it was PHENOMENAL. It was crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside, with just the right amount of spices and a little apple stuffing and orange or raspberry sauce. It was not the least bit dry or greasy, two usual risks of duck. I have eaten in more than 450 restaurants in the Chicago area, and this was one of the best meals I have ever had. 

Others in the group who also had duck loved it as well. Good reports were also given on the roast trout and the goulash, along with a variety of appetizers.

The price for this meal was under $20, quite reasonable.  

The ambiance of U Gazdy is unusual, reminiscent of a rustic mountain hunting lodge. I give this restaurant my highest recommendation. It is a bit off the beaten path, and a little hard to see from the road, but it is well worth seeking out."

This is a really bad ethnic eatery although the place looks nice with solid wood seating. The food is just Polish and as a result usually bad anyway and they have a menu that is only in Polish.

The food we had was quite good. Christopher had pork cutlet stuffed with ham and cheese. It came with dumplings and 3 small salad sides, as well as soup. I had the pork shank, which was served sizzling hot on a bed of sauerkraut, along with dumplings and soup. The portions we got were gigantic!!! I chose the pickle soup which was quite a unique experience. I liked it and Christopher liked his chicken noodle soup as well.

The food here was quite tasty, including the bread and smaltz.. Another unique taste experience!!!

We agreed that although this place was a bit of a drive, considering we have several very good Polish places near us, that we will return.

We liked everything about U Gazdy, except the prices. They were a tad high on some items."

We had six diners and each of us ordered something different. We tried two different types of pierogi (cheese and meat) along with herring in sour cream for starters. All were great. We tried a couple different soups, both the captain &#39;s and viewing pork cutlets, duck with raspberry sauce, real man&#39;s meatballs, and rabbit. All were amazing. The cocktails were well-made and we finished off the night with cherry cordials. 

The service team were helpful and friendly from the moment we walked in the door. Our server, Milan, was especially attentive and made the night very enjoyable. 

On top of all that, the decor is cool.  It has a rustic log cabin feel and the tables are constructed of large wooden slabs.

I chose dinner here on account of these rave reviews. My initial thought that this place is built sturdy, like cottage on a cold hillside. The inside decor was similar. Classy, wooden furniture. I felt like Snow White stepping into someone&#39;s home. Everyone spoke another language, both patrons and staff. (And everyone was Polish but me until my friend arrived.)

The general appetizer is wheat bread with... herb lard. Smalec, apparently. Here&#39;s how the internets describes it: &#34;You take bacon and dice it up then heat it until melted. Pour it in a container and let it cool. the more fat the bacon has, the better the smalec.&#34; Mhm. Interesting.

I tried chicken noodle soup and yellow pea soup. I am fairly certain both from a box. In fact, I think I have this Lipton noodle at home. 

The actual cooking itself is high quality. I like the think they choose lesser cuts of meat to keep in tradition with Polish cuisine. I tried a rainbow trout stuffed with almonds, herbs and garlic butter and Rumsztyk Steak, which is apparently round steak pounded out and served with grilled onions on top. The pork shank I wanted was sold out."

I&#39;m sure when I do I&#39;ll up the amount of stars I&#39;ve given but I just can&#39;t go above 3 stars for my first time there. There are so many great things on the menu I&#39;d like to try but on my first visit my friends and I agreed to do the Highlander Dinner for four which is $69. Pork sirloin escallops baked in smoked cheese cover with a mushroom sauce, lamb served with hunter&#39;s sauce, stuffed cabbage in a mushroom sauce, potato pancakes, gypsy style fries and grilled vegetable - we figured we&#39;d get a good try of many items but I think none of us ended up ordering what we wanted most of all! My personal favorites from this large assortment was the pork sirloin. I must admit though, when they brought out the large tray of food we all OOoooo-ed and AAaaah-ed!

This seemed like a massive amount but my friends who had been here before so the portions are bigger when ordering a single dish. Everything was good but I didn&#39;t find anything particularly amazing. We also had meat pierogis which were tasty but I really wanted to try the cheese or potato cheese pierogis as well! Our meal came with a choice of soup and we all ordered Chicken Noodle which was okay but nothing too special.

As I said----I need to go back. I still have high hopes for U Gazdy although honestly my first visit was just meh. My advice to others, skip the Highlander Meal for 4 and order single dishes."

Everyone loved the food, including the German and Italian diners in our party.  4 people had the Highlander potato pancake and loved it; only 1 person (a guy, I might add) could finish it.  One person had the stuffed cabbages in mushroom sauce, another had the pork tenderloin escallops and I had the Ziewont (or Giewont) cutlet.  The escallops were as might be expected - smallish slices of pork tenderloin on top of the dumpings (potatoes are an option).  The Ziewont cutlet was a softball-sized round breaded pork tenderloin inside of which was ham and melted cheese, which oozed out when you cut into the tenderloin.  Choice of potatoes or horsehoof dumplings - I had the latter. The 7th person in our party wasn&#39;t really hungry, so she had a bowl of the chicken soup and said it was good.  Everyone else started with the pickle soup, which came with dinner.  

The non-Polish people in our party loved the food just as much as the Polish people did.  Everyone left satisfied, most of us with leftovers.  I&#39;ve mentioned the pokey service before; it was a little better today.  Maybe it was because we had 6 pm reservations, and U Gazdy closed at 8?

I usually park in front, but parked in the back this time and saw the outdoor seating - picnic tables with umbrellas.  If it wasn&#39;t raining the day we were there, I would have suggested sitting there.

The only inconvenience (a minor one) was that they would only split the check in 2 - we had 7 people and wanted 5 separate checks - so everyone just paid in cash.  I thought this might be helpful to know, so you can bring cash if everyone is used to paying by credit or debit card."

It was a cold and rainy night, 10 degress colder than it was just days before.  I absolutely needed something substantial in the comfort food vein.  Lucky for me, I deced to try U Gazdy out.  

Much of the meal here is pretty much the antithesis of &#39;healthy&#39;, but it was oh so tasty.  We were seated right away, got the house tap beer (not even attempting to spell it here)and took a couple of minutes to browse the bilingual (polish/english) menu.  One note: pay attention when everyone mentions the length of service- they do not move quickly here.  Dinner was a very leisurely engagement.  

As you&#39;ll see people mention, they serve a wonderful fresh bread here...that comes with a side of divine bacon/lard/herb spread.  Keep this in mind.  It gives you idea of what to expect.  We tried the peirogi (and they let you split an order into half meat, half potato) and they were great.  Already at this point, we had both decided we could probably subsist on a dinner of the peirogi and bread with bacon lard spread.  But we ordered entrees anyway, because why not overdo it?

I had the mushroom soup (earthy and wonderful) and Highland Shepherds special (picture: meat, wrapped in meat, wrapped in more meat (no, not kidding here)).  My sibling had the monster-sized Highlander pancake, smothered in some of the best goulash you wil ever taste with the sald trio as a side, and the chicken soup as the starter).  The chicken soup was the one average item - everything else was transcendant.  We will absolutely be coming back here, and hopefully soon."

$32 and we did a $6 tip.

At first, it&#39;s a bit hard to find, but if you look for a sign for a Polish grocery store, you&#39;ll see the restaurant right next to this store. When you walk in, it&#39;s kind of like you&#39;re walking into a cabin, and seating is on these big open benches.

Our waitress was really pretty and so sweet. Even though there was a bit of a language barrier and she was a vegetarian talking to a meat lover (me), she was still able to make recommendations for me.

My friend and I started with the pierogi: we chose meat and either the cheese or the potato-cheese, I can&#39;t remember. But either way, they were delicious. But the plate is huge, so I would recommend just eating a few and packing the rest of them to go so you can enjoy an entree. 

For my main dish, I got the duck, which was huge. I like that I got a big portion because it felt like it was worth the cost, but the duck was just okay. I wasn&#39;t a fan of it being bone-in because it was hard to get to the meat, but I did like that it came with apples and raspberry sauce though, so it was kind of a cool twist. I definitely want to come back and try a different dish.

Unfortunately, I can&#39;t speak too much on the authenticity of the food (If you have seen my profile picture, you will have inferred that I am not Polish), but for what it&#39;s worth , the place/food sure felt pretty authentic to me!"

Been wanting to try this place as it&#39;s by my office and have read a lot of really good reviews.  Stopped in for lunch last week and was very impressed.  Outstanding, well prepared food with great flavor.  

The fresh bread and smalec was a great start, then went right into the fresh, homemade chicken noodle soup.  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin Escallops with dumplings.  Literally one of the best dishes I have ever had, and I consider myself somewhat of a food snob.  The mushroom gravy on this dish was so good I would have licked my plate if I wasn&#39;t in a public.  I decided to go with a piece of bread to sop up what was left on my plate.  

Service was great!  Attentive and kept a good eye on her tables.  When she asked how my meal was,I wanted to ask if I could &#34;hug the chef&#34;! 

Really cool atmosphere with great food and service!

Well done U Gazdy!!!"

I can not wait to eat there again. Also the prices are about 10%to 20% better than the other 2 i mentioned. The only thing i think they need is maybe a little larger menu as i will run out of new things to try after i go eat there the next 30 times lol.

U Gazdy&#39;s decor is slightly ambivalent and so unexpected because the restaurant is essentially a dark log cabin from the exterior. However, the interior emits rays of bright light during the day reflected from beautifully intricate wood work (looks like birch wood). The bar area is completely adorned in this wood which gives it a Polish Trader Vics vibe. 

The fact that this place was absolutely packed with Eastern Europeans at 3pm on a random Saturday made my first encounter all the more surreal.

The food here is really really good. It is Polish comfort food that tastes fresh and authentic.

The pierogi were soft and pillow-like dumplings. 

They serve bread with rendered pork fat that makes butter feel like a fat-free food. 

Upon recommendation, we ordered the center cut breaded pork chop which is a very generous portion not unlike weinerschnitzel. The dish came with delicious &#34;gnocchi-like&#34; dumplings.

My wife and I were stuffed at this point, but we were pretty happy.

U Gazdy is worth a visit if you&#39;re ever in the mood or on a mission for very good Polish food. The owners are also wonderful. 

My wife and I are looking forward to going back for dinner to try their other menu items."

Let me say that my meal was edible, but overpriced. On the other hand, my friend&#39;s food was amazing and practically a steal. I fully intend to come back and order what she had so I can give them a full five-stars.

The owner and all the employees and patrons were extremely friendly. They loved that we knew a handful of Polish phrases even though we were both clearly a couple generations removed from the old country. We loved the decor - delightfully kitsch with an abundance of wood paneling, carvings, animals hides, alcohol and cheesy 80s music. (ex. Total Eclipse of the Heart cover in English, but sung by a Polish woman with a thick accent)

On to the food portion of this tour. We were given a small loaf of bread and asked for a side of regular butter. My friend tells me they normally serve it with a side of bacon fat spread, which I&#39;ve had before and it is definitely an acquired taste. The crust was slightly hard and inside was fluffy, aka perfection. The same can be said for the creamy spinach soup. I don&#39;t know what spices were used, but it resembled vegeta/kucharek and was the perfect blend of seasoning and salt.

My main dish was a huge letdown. I still can&#39;t put my finger on it. The lamb chops were $25.50 and I expected a large portion and to be completely wowed. The size wasn&#39;t so bad for a single person, but it should have been at least half the price. Something about it tasted off. Not sure if it was the sauce, the meat, or a combination of the two. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but it hurts me to think I spent that much money and all I can say is that the presentation was beautiful and the grilled vegetables were good.

As far as I can tell, you&#39;re better off ordering a couple of the hot appetizers to make a meal. They are spot-on. And most other items on the menu seemed to be reasonably priced and done in the traditional way."

When you walk in the front door, you are immediately in front of the very small bar with maybe 10 stools.  I have not yet sat there.  Based on the proximity to the front door, I think it would be rather chilly in the winter.

Heading over to the right and towards the back is the main seating area.  Everything is made out of wood with an old fashioned, rough cut look.  Each table has a combination of chairs and bench seating.  I don&#39;t like the bench idea much because I need back support.

The staff is friendly and apparently all Polish.  Although I know a tiny bit of Polish, I have never been brave enough to try speaking it at U Gazdy.  It works out though, because they seem to understand English well enough.

The menu is filled with a good selection of traditional Polish dishes.  Since I have only been here a few times for lunch, I usually stick with the smaller things, like the U Gazdy sandwich, the kielbasa and the pierogi.  Everything is made as fresh as possible.  The pork cutlet is pounded out right after you order as told by the noise from the kitchen.  The pierogi are served freshly boiled.  This cooking style takes a bit longer, but it is worth the quality.  Don&#39;t be in a hurry if you come here.  To keep you busy while waiting, they start you off with some bread and pork lard spread.  It may not be the most healthy, but it sure is tasty!

Overall I like the fun decor and the authentic food.  I would like to come back for dinner when I can enjoy a drink with my food.  I just wonder how busy it gets.  I would definitely recommend U Gazdy for a little taste of Poland."

I have been here twice now. The only thing I recall from my first visit, was my entree was some stuffed pastry dish that was instantly forgetable, and that the soup I had (don&#39;t remember what) was so dern good that I ate my wife&#39;s portion and mine. 
On my second visit, I shared the duck with my wife - yuck! My plate had 3/4 gristle, fat and nasty on it, and only approximately a 1/4 meat was able to be salvaged off that bird. At $20 for the bird, is it &#39;that&#39; bird? Or is it bird in general? Not sure and I can&#39;t afford to find out. 
I admit that I am totally ignorant when it comes to polish food and unfortunately the polish in my party were not providing me much direction. I will say that the wait staff were more than accomodating on letting me try a taste, whether I was making a beer choice or trying to decide which soup to get. 
I will also give points for ethnic genuiness. This place is so genuine, that when you first walk in, you feel like the movie American Werewolf, when the two American guys get caught in the rain on the plains and step into the wolf bar (awkward) but not in a bad way. And as you settle in, you pick up on the fact that most definitely, the locals do patronize."

Everything here expresses a sincere quality, from the rustic wood interior to the snappy yet friendly staff.  The sense of cultural pride is ever-present, but never pretentious or exclusive. 
The food is superbly done and presented in various stacks, piles and mounds that appeal directly to a primal joy firmly seated in the heart of every man (and some women, I&#39;m sure). So far I&#39;ve enjoyed some roast duck with gypsy fries and some pork escallops with dumplings and mushroom sauce. Both were excellent and paired very well with my Żywiec porter. Prices are moderate considering the scope (some dishes leave you wondering if there&#39;s actually a plate under everything, or just more food).
On that note, I fully intend on taking on the Highlander Dinner (with a couple comrades, for certain) once the weather cools and I can trudge in from the wind and snow, and saddle up to a massive seemingly Flintstones-inspired pile of meat, potatoes and roasted vegetables, mug of porter in hand."

And no, I&#39;m not Polish but I know when someone&#39;s grandmother had a major influence on a chef. The food can be greasy if you aren&#39;t careful but that&#39;s how I expect sauteed onions to be cooked traditionally for instance when I&#39;m at a Polish friend&#39;s home. My buddy Chris calls it highlander cooking. I enjoyed my czerwone barszcz (red borscht) soup very much. Their version of smalec (rendered pork fat) was seasoned with garlic, herbs and other spices.

My husband and I happened upon this place on their GRAND OPENING on a snowy day a few years ago and fell in love with the owners, Betty and Shawn, and everything about the place.

The building:  first of all, U Gazdy is located next door to Helen&#39;s Deli (HELLO!) and all the gorgeous and authentic woodwork was done by owner Shawn and I think his father-in-law if I remember the story right. Ask them about the beautiful murals while you are there- they show landscaping of the Highlands of Poland, which is where their families are from. My husband and I love to sit at the bar because of the beautiful woodwork and listen to all the regulars speak Polish. We are not Polish but the servers all speak Polish and it seems to be a home away from home for many.

The food:  P.i.e.r.o.g.i.s.  AMAZING!  The meat pierogis are my favorite (with a side of bacon and its grease to pour on top if you desire - I DO) followed by the Potato and Cheese. We usually order the Pierogis with an entree.  We personally love the cutlet or potato pancake with goulash dishes.  You always know when someone is ordering a cutlet because  you hear the pounding from the kitchen into the dining room.  Authentic Hylander Polish food that tips the border on extreme comfort food!!!  

I can&#39;t even begin to tell you how much I love U Gazdy in Wood Dale for its food, people and intimate atmosphere.  If you live in city take the Milwaukee District West train and get off in Wood Dale - walk two and a half blocks west on Irving Park for a truly authentic experience!"

i had the rabbit.  it was a big chunk of leg or maybe the breast.  i&#39;ve only had rabbit from a french restaurant.  and they&#39;ve already pulled the meat from the bones.  it looks like a half piece of chicken on a plate.

Their vegetarian options looked very good.

I&#39;d definitely go back there to try other items."

We had the cabbage rolls, pork tenderloin sandwich, and perogies. The only disappointment was we didn&#39;t get the gypsy fries just the regular ones. The sandwich was huge and sauce with it great. Crispy fresh not greasy. Cabbage rolls on point fresh and great mushroom sauce. Perogies covered in bacon and sour cream. I will be back and I will speak well of this place.

Food meh. Every item to be ordered was a pain - took forever to get someone to take our drink order, then she darts away as soon as she has it. Same for apps. Then the food took forever to get to us. Probably the worst was they served our children, without asking us, first - as in, 25 full minutes before our meal was served. Yes, you read that right. This is not a place I expect to have a 2 hour meal, esp when we arrive for dinner with the elderly in-laws, at 5pm.  Our kids were bouncing off the walls while we tried, in vain, to get anyone, anyone at all, to refill a water glass. Our kids had been finished for 15 minutes when our food finally arrived. I&#39;d have asked for it sooner but we couldn&#39;t find anyone, much less our waitress, to ask.  My dinner was almost wholly incorrect, vegetables prepared incorrectly, salad never came.  No one to complain to, the dishes were dropped and person who brought them (not server), scooted away. We inhaled our food not worth waiting for and then begged anyone who passed our table for our check. I finally tracked down our server sitting at the bar. My bill was a receipt with no description, just amounts. I paid it and we got the hell out of dodge."

And by golly, I think I found it!

I did try their sushi rolls before which I remember being tasty, and not too much rice (too much rice means too little fish!). But I will write more specifically about two of their lunch specials which I had today with my dad. 

I ordered Chicken Katsu, he ordered the bibimbop which comes in a hot stone bowl (best way to have bibimbop, in my opinion). 

They serve a small salad and miso soup before the actual meals come out.   Like I said, I had the chicken katsu, and it is AWESOME!!! I&#39;ve had other katsu before but the coating they use is crisped to perfection. You hear a literal crunch! The sauce on top of the katsu was also delicious. It has a subtle sweetness to it. I&#39;m used to seeing the tonkatsu sauce that Asian groceries sell, but was pleasantly surprised that they had a different sauce. I should have asked if it was a pre made thing or if they make their own special sauce. 

My Dad ordered the bibimbop. He&#39;s an older Korean man who&#39;s hard to please, esp with Korean food. But even my Dad said the bibimbop was great. Perfect amount of rice and veggies. He ordered his with beef and he said he was surprised how tender the beef was! I tried a bite - and I concur, it was awesome!

They do not serve a lot of side dishes like the Korean restaurants (ex. Sansoo Gapsan in Morton grove) do, but that&#39;s okay. They did give us kimchi and a pickled radish that I really enjoyed. And I usually don&#39;t like kimchi!

The owner is behind the sushi bar, and the servers are really nice! Atmosphere is great. Looking forward to future trips here!"

Sashimi Salad has a kick to it and full of bursting flavors that won&#39;t be forgotten.  I truly love this salad.  If in case you&#39;re not a fan of spicy food, don&#39;t be afraid to tell them. They may make it to your specifications.  What makes this dish is the combination of sauces to the salmon and tuna and the crunch of the cabbage/salads. This is also great with white rice.  I&#39;m already full.

Tamago is always bomb.  The sweetness of the egg by itself is awesome already. No need for rice but, also good with.

For my main course I ordered an appetizer, Fried Salmon Fish Collar.  OMG!  The taste of this dish was just amazing.  This was cooked perfectly, crunchy outside and the meat was super moist. It wasn&#39;t overcooked at all.  

My dinner came with the perfect taste of Miso Soup and Salad.  I&#39;m stuffed!  I&#39;ll be back again before moving on to the new area of Chicago.

Fun Facts:  the chef&#39;s love for cooking came from his mother at a very young age working in their family restaurant business."

I was in the area for a couple meetings and had a hankering for some Ramen. I didn&#39;t have enough time to read the reviews, but with a 4.5 star average I figured I&#39;d give them a try.

I was sat at a table right by the entrance which was fine by me, especially since I was dining alone. I was glad it was a table for four so I had enough room for my laptop to get some work done while I eat. You should note that they have free wifi! You just need to ask for the password.

My waitress and the rest of the staff were great. They have a very large menu with awesome lunch specials. I definitely love my sushi, but was dead set on a hot bowl of ramen. The waitress did inform me that their ramen noodles were instant, but my mind was too made up to pick something else. The good news, was that a bowl of their spicy ramen came with your choice of one of four sushi roll options. I went with the shrimp tempura.

They serve lemon water automatically, so if that isn&#39;t your thing be sure to ask for regular. I was pleasantly surprised to be served a complimentary cup of miso soup and a side salad. Sweet! Both were delicious.

Of course the spicy ramen I had was nothing compared to the authentic ramen I&#39;ve had elsewhere, but I&#39;m glad my waitress informed me prior about the instant noodles. The broth was really tasty and definitely spicy. I love spicy foods so ending this meal with a runny nose was cool with me, but if you can&#39;t handle the heat I wouldn&#39;t suggest this! The shrimp tempura roll was a very good addition. It&#39;s wrapped in seaweed, and I prefer just the rice, but it was good nonetheless.

The cherry on top of all of this is that my bill was less than $9! Miso soup, salad, spicy ramen, and a shrimp tempura roll for that price is insanely awesome. I will definitely be keeping Hakuya in mind the next time I&#39;m in the area. Thankful as always for my Yelp app."

The place was pretty empty so the service was attentive. The favorite thing I loved about the place was the manager&#39;s charisma! He would come to your table to chat and make jokes. That made my dinner more entertaining for sure. 
In terms of the food, I got the beef stone Buddha bowl, and two 5 PC rolls (Definitely too much food for one person, I only could finish half of what I ordered). Since i went between Monday to Thursday, they had their lunch pricing effective all day! So the bowl came with small app dishes including edaeme, miso soup, and small salad. However, I was not a fan of it because it was bland and dry so I picked at it and ate the beef, eggs, and some veggies. For the rolls, I got the Fat chuck and holy crab maki. Both were tasty but terribly rolled! The pieces would completely fall apart and made it difficult to grab and dip. The ginger was also pretty dried up."

I never knew this place was so close to my house. I was immediately excited to try this place out. The place is small and cozy, I enjoy going to to places like this. The place was quiet, with an intimate setting. The music was the top subject that night, they played everything I loved. The service was okay. I felt like they were not as attentive as they should be.  I had to ask for a water refill twice. Toward the end of our dinner, I had felt like we were being pushed out. With regards to the food, I had looked up the menu before my friends and I went and I knew exactly what I wanted to order. I ordered the prawn and the golden mustang roll. Before our sushi arrived, we were brought soup and edamame (which I had ordered). The soup was not as flavorful as I had hoped. But I was too excited for the sushi. When they arrived, the overall appearance was beautiful. I snapped a picture. Both rolls were without a doubt SUPER FRESH. But I have to say, I&#39;ve had better sushi before.

Actual sushi bar and restaurant are small with limited seating but it wasn&#39;t too busy on my visit. Bathroom was clean, had plenty of air fresheners. The odd thing was they had the hand soap on top of the toilet?

I ordered the A-2 combo which consisted of 6 pcs of nigiri sushi and shrimp tempera roll.   Miso soup, salad, and potato croquet was also included. The potato croquet was delicious. Sushi was nothing special.  Shrimp tempura was drowning in sauce a bit.

I ordered the sashimi platter for pickup (it was being wrapped up as I arrived, and I ate it within 5min of picking it up). 

The fish was soggy and lacked flavor. The color was slightly off too, but the smell wasn&#39;t bad so I still ate it (I&#39;m hoping I don&#39;t get sick). 
The wasabi was watery and tasted like it was the processed, store-bought variety, and even the shredded daikon was soggy and tasteless, as though it had been sitting in a cooler inside an airtight Tupperware container for a few days. 

Considering the large number of positive reviews and the fact that the total price for my platter was about $30, I expected much better. I was very disappointed by Hakuya Sushi. The only positive things I can say about this place are that my order was prepared fast, and the young woman who greeted me and brought me my order was very friendly.

Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

Side note:
It&#39;s unfortunate that my first ever Yelp review is an extremely negative one, but I felt it was important to let others know that despite the positive reviews Hakuya has, this is a place to avoid."

So why isn&#39;t this a 5 star review? As I was eating my California roll I noticed one of the waitresses talking right next to the sushi bar fluffing up her hair and leaning on it. Talk about unsanitary. Not to mention she didn&#39;t wash her hands after that. Call me a germaphobe but it cost them a star in my book.

But to start off the staff was awesome bring water but not any water lemon water.  And was so good about filling up my cup.  Then they give you complimentary miso soup and salad and edamame! This along was impressive... the price was totally reasonable.  We got the Tokyo nachos and four different rolls... everything was phenomenal. I love the menu was very easy to read  put in different categories like raw fish, veggie rolls...for anyone new to try sushi!

Went there with my wife on a Saturday around 5pm. Had the place to ourselves except for one more table taken. We did see a lot of take out going out the door though. Had the extra spicy tuna roll and King Dragon roll. Both were delicious. We finished those and then asked for the menu to try and find one more to try. The chef came to the table and recommended the White Dragon Roll. So, we ordered it. He saw that we liked spicy so we overheard him tell the other chefs to make it spicy for us. Great recommendation and loved that he payed attention to the customers. Extra bonus was the Miso soup and Salad that came with the Sushi and they brought Edamame for us as well. Definitely going back."

1. Good quality sushi. Ordered crab/salmon/tuna and all three were fresh tasting. 
2. Affordable. Most rolls were under $8-$9 with the specialty around $12-$15. Didn&#39;t pack it with extra rice. 
3. Double fried tempera crunch roll. The least authentic roll but so delicious.

I think it was shumai. The fish cuts were nice and they were fresh. Service was quick as well and I think I spent a total of $12, including tip. (The special was about $9.50). If you want to choose your own cuts of nigri, it is a $4 charge. 
They also have regular Japanese and Korean dishes. Be aware they are closed on Mondays. The only reason for losing a star (I actually  give them 4.5), is that they give you this water infused with lemon, and it was a tad weird. Though I will definitely be coming back here!"

I am a big, big fan of hot pots in general. At some point in my life I developed a very solid cuisine desire for anything asian, from thai to vietnamese to chinese to korean to japanese. I have not explored every aspect of each, but there are some definite takeaways from each culture. 

In this case, you have Hakuya serving up sushi and some korean food as well. I didn&#39;t see any bulgogi, but they did have vegetable tempura and a unique take on a few sushi rolls that I haven&#39;t seen in many other sushi restaurants anywhere. Either their chef has a lot of leeway (which seems to be a good thing) in sushi creativity or something else. I&#39;m not complaining.

Meanwhile, ordering a hot pot or a lunch special at lunch time will get you some miso and a small salad to go with whatever you happen to order - so right away you&#39;re getting a pretty good deal. 

 So, hot pot. Was it hot? I&#39;m guessing you could figure out the answer to that was yes. What was it not? It was not bad, which means it was quite good. I was happy with the hot pot overall - having the equivalent of bibimbap in a hot pot is always a nice thing, but I do feel like maybe they could have added a touch more rice to the hot pot - I felt like it was a slightly short on that. Overall it was nice to order a tofu hot pot, though.

Good lunch place!"

I&#39;ve gone here maybe 10 times now and I have never been disappointed with the food. The staff brings you complimentary miso soup, a ginger salad (to die for), and something they call a monster ball which is basically made of sweet potato and has a crunchy outside similar to a tater tot.

My usual is the Abigale and the Hot Chuck. The Abigale is crunchy on the outside as it&#39;s made of a tempura base, it&#39;s served with sliced apples, which adds a great combination of sweet and slightly spicy. The Hot Chuck is great too, it&#39;s got a few sauces in between that give it a nice kick. The Abigale is a relatively larger portion size than most sushi places so 2 rolls of that should feed about 2-3 people. I have tried a few other rolls but seem to get these two more often than others.

The restaurant has a very comfortable home feeling, Chuck, the owner of Hakuya, is extremely friendly and funny. Chuck walks around, cracks jokes, and makes sure everyone is having a good time."

1. The decor was just blah. Most sushi places are very chic and modern. This one was utilized very plain furniture. Looks like a cheap cafeteria at a ski resort!

2. The salad that came with the entre was made at the counter - not even in the kitchen. I watched as the waitress poured the sauce into the salad and then mixed the ingredients with her fingers (WITHOUT ANY GLOVES)! Gross :(

3. The sushi itself was pretty good. Can&#39;t complain.

He&#39;s enjoyable to talk to when you dine in alone, and he makes great recommendations. I asked him to surprise me once, and he gladly invented a roll on the spot. Needless to say, it was delicious! Oh, and I absolutely love the salad dressing. Even the water is special. Instead of adding the typical lemon, Hakuya Sushi uses different fruits for their water. One time I had strawberry-flavored water, and the next I had orange. Although the place is small, the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere with polite waitresses.

Of course, the main attraction are the rolls when it comes to sushi restaurants. They are huge here. This place does not cheap out like other sushi restaurants by putting in crappy fillers. The chef always puts in big pieces of fish. And the sauces are magnificent. My favorite roll is the Salmon Addiction. But honestly, I&#39;ve tried many of their rolls and they are all tasty.

I typically avoid sushi restaurants in run-down strip malls with pics of unappetizing looking sushi in the windows. However, I was willing to give a 4.5 star rated sushi restaurant a try.

I can&#39;t comment on dinner here, but lunch was super affordable and appetizing. The lovely Candice G and I each ordered 2 rolls that came with miso soup AND a salad. Gotta love lunch specials at sushi restaurants. Our waiter even brought out some sort of complimentary potato balls. All that food for 2 people came to less than $20. Score!

The sushi itself was fresh and may just be among the best sushi I&#39;ve experienced in the North Shore. Our waiter was also lovely seemed to notice we were Hakuya novices so I&#39;m guessing they get a lot of regulars. I may become one myself when in the area."

Not because I eat outside the box or do anything particularly daring, but because I typically like to eat my lunch around 4:30/5pm. I know, right? Could one be any more punk rock?

So, that normally works out pretty well for me. I&#39;m able to hit up happy hour specials for my lunch time and that meal usually tides me over through dinner time and leaves me free for dessert. 100% effective and cost efficient... until I found out about Hakuya Sushi&#39;s lunch special. 

WhattaDeal!

The exterior of the building, to be fair, doesn&#39;t make it look like a place that would have the best sushi. It&#39;s in a strip mall with weird teal awnings that kind of make each storefront look like they&#39;re part of a row of old washing machines -- VERY easy to drive by, but you&#39;ll be missing out if you do. 

Our lunch for 2 came to $18, I believe, and we both got bowls of miso soup, salad (with that delicious ginger dressing), and amuse bouche (a spicy-ish potato ball), and two rolls each. Sweet deal. 

And even sweeter is that the freshness of the soosh was actually pretty darn high. The service was efficient and EXTREMELY patient as I couldn&#39;t help but overhear the woman at table clear across the dining room ask the man no less than infinity +1 obnoxious questions about everything and anything as if it were her first time ever trying food. Oy. Brought me back to my days as a server when I&#39;d have to answer the most ridiculous questions from people who may have experiencing their first day on Earth. Questions like, &#34;Broccoli? Can you describe it&#39;s taste? What else does it taste like?&#34; ... Do you have any idea how hard it is to describe broccoli? It only tastes like one thing... and that thing is broccoli. Ugh. People. Double Ugh. 

Anyway, I went with the spicy tuna and spicy salmon lunch combo where you get those two full rolls, a really delicious and actually pretty generous miso soup, plus a salad, plus an amuse bouche. For an $8.95 lunch special, it was grand. And will absolutely have me coming back for full on dinner in the very near future. 

I might have to rework my genius dining schedule to accommodate more lunchtime delights at Hakuya."

The restaurant is in a small plaza with a martial arts center and dance center. However, parking is generous. 
There were also a bunch of plants in front of the restaurant, which I found a bit out of place.

A Korean-born, Cordon Bleu chef putting together OUTSTANDING, creative sushi. Order off the back of the menu , the Specials. Talk to the chef, he&#39;ll come out and help you order. Don&#39;t even touch the soy sauce and wasabi until you taste this stuff. WOW!

The fried shrimp roll was good, it had 6 pieces, on a sacle of 5 it was a 4. I mean granted I also adjusted my standards to the suburbs.
As for the udon, props to a older lady for making it, very hands down. Makes me think this is a family run business. When they call it spicy udon they weren&#39;t kidding, there are pieces of jalapanos in it. The udon however was sub par, no shrimp tempura or vegetable, just a few slices of imitation crab, scallion, udon and jalapanos. The broth was not particularly good either. Well I guess at least the spiciness cleared up my allergy symptoms temporarily.
I came on a week day dinner time, 2 tables were occupied, i was one of the 2 people waiting for takeout. The sushi chef was loud and I guess friendly enough, he greeted me hello and goodbye. 1 waiter, she seems baffled and busy, not sure why since not many people. 
Looks like they have lunch specials for $6.49 at least that is what is written on their windows.

Also, they have a very limited menu here, at least for dinner. Basically appetizers(around 6 options), their hot pot bowl, or udon/ramen(which is instant ramen). The rest are all sushi.

Overall, it&#39;s not bad but neither is it amazing. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come back."

Well, recently, I had a not-so-great experience there, and decided it was time for a break.  I have started a new love affair with Sushi-Ai in Palatine, but it&#39;s a bit of a hike for me, so we decided to try Hakuya.  We&#39;ve had Hakuya twice now, once for take-out and once sit down.

Take-out was fast and efficient through GrubHub.  There were no problems with my order, which included complimentary miso soup.  I also like how they package their sushi to go when you order large amounts- in aluminum sheet pans, easy for serving. 

Dine-in was just as good!  Complimentary miso soup, house salad, and a hot appetizer!  Service was spot on.  The restaurant was not very crowded on the weeknight we went, but service was attentive without being pushy.

I can&#39;t remember exactly everything we ordered, we generally steer clear of rolls that include cream cheese, which limits their menu a bit.

The quality of fish is solid - I did order the Chirashi bowl when we had dine-in, assorted cuts of sashimi over sushi rice - nothing disappointed.  Large slices of fish, I couldn&#39;t finish everything I was given.

Hakuya gives my normal place a run for its money, even though cream cheese is found in many of the rolls."

But that didn&#39;t stop us from running out the door. I am kind of a sushi snob I must say, Toro and Coast in Chicago are my absolute faves so all these suburban sushi places just don&#39;t do it for me on the freshness level nor the service, but hakuya really did surprise me.

Our server was really nice and did a great job through our entire meal. Our party of 7 left full and happy with him. He gave us some free edamame on the house since we made a reservation. Sweet! We also got a complimentary salad with ginger dressing, not too bad. Oh and free miso soup, this I can definitely get used to. Other BG sushi places: take notes and give out some freebies: That usually gets you more business.

Now onto the food, the part that I thought would disappoint me, it turned out to be pretty darn good. It was full of fish, full of flavor and good ratio of rice and fish in my opinion. 

-Spicy Salmon-Very standard roll that tells me how good the sushi place is and it was delish, I requested the seaweed on the outside (as it should be).

-Fat Chuck Roll- my fave, spicy salmon, avocado, cucumber, cream cheese, covered in eel and tobiko. Sooo good, but I didn&#39;t get the cilantro with it. 

-Tuna Tataki or something like that-My husband liked that roll, full of spicy tuna and seared tuna on top.

Overall, the sushi was decent, obviously not the best that I&#39;ve had, but for the burbs, it&#39;s great. I would have given it 3 stars for good quality food, but the service definitely brings it up a notch. They have my vote for a quick bite or carryout in BG."

This place is quite easily missed, with all the other suprprisingly good sushi establishments in the area, but take my advise and eat here. Fresh fish, excellent fresh ingredients, tightly rolled...rolls. Good, good, good stuff. Plus, it&#39;s family owned!

My personal favorites are the &#34;Phili&#34; Roll and the &#34;Big and Short&#34; Roll. One thing I don&#39;t like (just being honest) is that they put a sweet sauce on the philli roll, but it&#39;s so good, that having to ask for no sauce on top still makes this place five-stars.

First, it was an unusually (but welcomed) warm November Thursday evening when we decided to come here. It&#39;s not too far from the Arboretum but it can be easily missed unless you look for it. 
We decided to eat in (vs. take out) and ordered 6 falafals and the mixed meat platters so we can try a little bit of each of the meats. We also purchased a fountain drink and a bottled of Caleb&#39;s kola. We are not cola drinkers, however, it was delicious! Also I am always a sucker for those fountain machines just to mix different flavors. 3 flavors of SoBe Lifewaters? Yes, please! 

Now on to the food! They served our food to us at our table (so nice!). Two words, Super yum! 
The platters come with salad with cucumbers and tomato cubes in a tasty (but not too much) vinaigrette and pita bread. I recommend this place alone in the delicious spices. The rice was very delish with a nice subtle flavor that wasn&#39;t too over powering. 

The meats were very good. They were all spiced so well with very complimentary flavors. When you start combining the flavors together between the salad, rice, chicken and beef, you are left with a plethora of flavor that will leave you satisfied and pleased! 

Be prepared to share or take some food home because they give you plenty, which is nice for lunch left overs.  I recommend Pita Pita for the nice decor, yummy food, fountain machine and good service. It isn&#39;t the best Mediterranean we&#39;ve had but it is very delicious and it&#39;s not too far from us."

My go-to dish is Chicken Shawarma lunch portion substituting rice for hummus. It&#39;s the perfect amount of food and coupled with their red chili sauce the dish is full of flavor.

They are definitely slightly on the slow side but I&#39;m sure that will improve with age, it&#39;s still a very new business."

The menu was similar to many Mediterranean places we&#39;d been to but the sautéed section intrigued me. Naturally I like to order something different. 

The place was kept pretty clean and inviting but the benches could use a wipe-down to remove the dirt marks.

The waiting time was much longer than we expected. It seemed that many people came in for pickup so that might have prolonged the serving of the food. 

Now the food... we had high hopes but we were a bit disappointed afterwards. 

The food was presented in a nice ceramic dish, so we were at first very pleased, but after we dug our forks in, there came the frowny faces. 

The sautéed veggies were a bit overcooked and too mushy to my liking. It was not how I anticipated a sautéed dish would look/taste like. Tomato sauce was used in the dish but unfortunately it was overpowering the other flavors. Beef Shawarma was on the dry side and lacking seasonings. Some pieces were kind of chewy. Overall the protein was a bit underwhelming. 

This place has potential but for now there&#39;s a lot of room for improvement."

That being said, I was a little disappointed in my first visit. It took them about 20 min to make my food, leaving me a whole 10 min to eat, I only get 30 min lunches. I would have called in but it looked like a quick serve restaurant like Naf Naf is so I didn&#39;t think it would be an issue and I only ordered a schwarma wrap and fries.
The fries were seriously some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. So good. But the beef schwarma was pretty dry, I definitely had to put lots of sauce on it to be able to eat it. 

They have a mini fridge over by the drink area that you can take your own sauces from so that was nice except they aren&#39;t labeled so I had no idea what I was eating. Mediterranean food isn&#39;t what I grew up with so I don&#39;t know all the different sauces or toppings yet. It just would have been nice to have them labeled.

You can choose your own seat and they do have a busboy so you can leave your dishes at the table when you&#39;re done. 

Overall, I didn&#39;t hate it. I think they have some kinks to work out being a new business and if I order carryout again I&#39;ll definitely call ahead."

The wraps are about twice as big as the pita sandwiches, so those are definitely worth getting.  I had the hummus, bhaba ganoush, and the muthawama.  The muthawama dip was my favorite.  If you like garlic, you&#39;ll love it.  The hummus wasn&#39;t my favorite, but all of the other options make up for it.  They&#39;re a little slow getting food out, but I don&#39;t think they anticipated being so busy!"

I have picked up food from the location in Palatine prior that visiting here last Thursday. This time I ate in since this location is very close to my house. I was not disappointed at all. This place is great. Food was fire (awesome). I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. Staff was nice and attentive in cleaning and clearing off tables. Food is authentic and fresh. Many places that claim to have Mediterranean/middle eastern food are more Greek or Indian style. This is more authentic Arabic food. Try it, you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

So I place this brand spanking new restaurant against other Middle Eastern restaurants in the area. The meats are definitely good, the rice is meh, basically flavored Pilaf and then basic pita. The pita doesn&#39;t seem to be made on premise like others do in the area, but it works. I LOVED their Muthwama, which is an authentic dip I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere. 
The decor of the place is pretty spiffy and the customer service was good as well. I want to go back and try their Chicken Tawook. All in all, the meal was good just not great."

It&#39;s a good cheap place to get a slice of thin crust...if you are into that kinda thing. The pizza is decent. If u order a slice that&#39;s not pre made already, for example onion or something, they will chop up some onions and toss them on the cheese slice and broil it. Pretty standard. Stick with cheese, sausage, and pepperoni. It&#39;s the kinda place u should dab ur pizza when no one is looking. Because I mean come on, who does that sorta thing?

Other than the pizza...the better stuff I&#39;ve got is the fries with merkts cheddar, garlic bread, and Italian ice. The burger is all right. Always say I want a sandwich from here but in my 20 or so times I been there, my cheap ass just got. Slice of pizza. 

Dab. 

Stars taken off due to lack of cleanliness, creepy guys in the video poker area, grease, and that&#39;s about it. Jet&#39;s is better but it&#39;s so damn far from here.

The Italian ice alone gets 5 stars since it is so refreshing, cool and perfect tart to sweet ratio. 

It is a fun place for a family night and I know they do tons of fundraising and community things also. Any business that supports local activities and charities deserves a high five!

The restaurant has a familiarity to it. The interior hasn&#39;t changed much since the eighties.

My mom came over for a visit and I&#39;ve been wanting a slice of Garibaldi&#39;s New York style pizza for 3 days now. My boyfriend and I returned to have a Pizza Burger. I should not have listened to him when he told me it&#39;s bad luck to go to the same restaurant, twice in one day, because he jinxed me.

I&#39;m going to blame him for my reason not to like their burger but I think it&#39;s more accurate to tell you that Buona Beef and The Assembly make them better. The Grilled Chicken Breast we ordered for our dog was OK. At least they don&#39;t charge us full price like Portillo&#39;s does for just a patty.

My mom enjoyed her lasagna with meat sauce. It was served with Italian garlic bread. It was too big to eat in one sitting. She took half her entire order home.

When my mom asked for a lid, we learned Garibaldi&#39;s uses different plates for dining in and carrying out. I should deduct a star for not being cost efficient. They can allocate the savings to better hamburger meat."

With 2 slices you also get a free drink (Coke Products) which was a great deal. You go to you table and they call you up by receipt number when food is ready.

So, we saw this place on yelp with great reviews. Decided to get delivery. Our pizza was a HOT mess!! Half the cheese was on the side of the pizza on the cardboard, but there was still pools of grease on the pizza itself. The sauce just tasted funny... Maybe too salty? We wonder if maybe they just didn&#39;t wash the mushrooms before chopping them up and putting them on pizza... or rinse them off when thwy got them out of thr can. The chicken strips we got were soggy crust on the outside and pink on the inside.

I WANT an Italian Beef. If anyone has read my other reviews, I love Italian Beef sandwiches. I live for them. Looking here on Yelp, I see Garibaldi&#39;s is close by. Let&#39;s give it a try.

Garibaldi&#39;s is full of kitschy 50&#39;s music memorabilia and a huge fiberglass Elvis. And the place is empty except a family at one end watching a football game on the TV. 

But they have Italian Beef. And...I am undecided how I feel about it. Normally, the things come out of the kitchen wet and sloppy. This sandwich was sitting on a plate, sliced in half, and almost dry, but with cheese melted allover the top. Huh? Examining it further, the sandwich was toasted in an oven, hence the melted cheese. I believe they took the beef out of the pan it was in still wet, and placed on the bread. Oh that bread! It soaked the juices up, so it was crisp and toasty on the outside, and soft and juicy on the inside. 

I am happily confused. I wonder if they will dip the sandwich if asked?"

My mom, brother, and son really liked the pasta they got too (I just thought it was okay, and the garlic bread was so salty I couldnt even eat it).  Portion sizes are huge!!!  You will definitely not be hungry later.
Another issue I had when ate there a different time is that their drink machines are WAY TOO HIGH.  Makes me angry to feel like I have &#34;kid status&#34; just because I&#39;m short.  Obviously nothing to do with the food though.

Plus, they use Turano bread, which is perfect.  They also get serious bonus points for having waffle fries.  The Hubs likes their big pizza by the slice as well.

It&#39;s not &#34;fast food&#34; so you may be waiting 10 minutes for your order to be ready during their peak lunch rush, but it&#39;s worth it.  I like the 50&#39;s diner decor, too."

We ordered the southwest chopped salad that was served with a sesame dressing (the kind an Asian salad would come with) and my only recommendation to the owner would be to come up with a smoked chipotle dressing or another type that would fit the &#34;southwestern&#34; salad better.

I then ordered Chicken Parmigiana. The taste was great. Chicken was cooked properly. I ordered it along with meat sauce.The food quality was above average for sure. It would rate it more of 3.5 stars then 3. Ambiance is what i liked the most .Typical old americana. Definitely would recommend to visit the place with family.

We&#39;ve seen the same driver out in our neck of the woods for the past few years. Their food is always piping hot and they actually go out of their area to bring us food because they love the fiance and he tips well. The fiance almost cried when the closed for awhile. He&#39;s a New Yorker by birth and loves Garibaldi&#39;s crust. Their sauce is generous and they have fresh mushrooms to go with their great Italian sausage.

The place has been around forever. It is a hang out spot since there was a movie theater (long gone), bowling alley (HS teams bowl there) and night club in the mall.  Mostly a Italian beef and quick pizza joint (with delivery service). The food is good, sometimes a little salty, but good.  One of a few from the family in the area, the front is getting redecorated again by the mall this week. 

The inside has a 50s diner theme with a bunch of TVs on sports/ESPN. The atrium is great for getting some sunlight at lunch after working in a cubicle all morning.

I recommend getting the large pizza special cheese and adding sausage done crispy. They are plentiful with the sauce and it needs a couple extra minutes to get the crust fully baked. 

The coca-cola soda fountain allows refills with a bunch of flavors including Barqs Red Cream.  

Locals should keep an eye out for local coupons mailed in the area."

Putting that aside, Garibaldi&#39;s is a fantastic Italian fast food place. I&#39;ve been going since I was in grade school and I&#39;ve NEVER had a bad meal there. 

The Pizza: I&#39;ve never had real New York pizza but I imagine this is really really close. The crust is thin, flops and bends in the front, you start off crunching into it and it then gets chewy. The toppings and cheese stays with your bite and doesn&#39;t come off the slice. The sauce is tangy but not too sweet. To me this is the best pizza in the world but then again, I&#39;m biased. 

The Other Stuff: I&#39;ve had the pastas, sandwiches, and burgers and they are all above average. 

The only reason I&#39;m deducting a star is because I heard the cheap ass owner didn&#39;t pay his taxes and was shut down for a few months. Those agonizing months as I drove by day after day craving pizza and cursing this place....

Original review as follows:

Awful. Food was not good. Service was slow. Very disappointed. And more expensive than a place like this should be!
The Mac n cheese was super hot, like it was microwaved. Then it cooled off very quickly &amp; was very dry and looked (and tasted!) like Kraft mac n cheese, they are definitely over charging for it. Yuck. 
Italian beef did not have a good flavor at all. 
They forgot our fries when we finally got our food. We had to wait til we were half way done with our food before we finally got our fries.

The decor is retro 50&#39;s era, I half expected Richie Cunningham and Potsie to be seated at booth nearby. There&#39;s red vinyl seats, chrome trim on the tables and Buddy Holly and his contemporaries piping in on the overhead music. (check out Happy Days if you have no idea what I&#39;m talking about) 

That being said, the decor might be 1950&#39;s, but the pizza to me is reminiscent of 1980&#39;s mall pizza. We&#39;re talking Chicago&#39;s Brickyard Mall or North Riverside Mall of the mid 80&#39;s. You might know what I&#39;m talking about--the large slices of pizza were made up of thin soggy crust, sweet watery tomato sauce and a smattering of mozzarella cheese. These kind of slices are served on wax paper and plastic tray. Mall food all the way. (Check out Fast Times at Ridgemont High if you have no idea what I&#39;m talking about) 

By the star rating, you guessed it, the pizza is not very good. I also tried their Italian Ice--lemon--too sweet with only a hint of tartness. and the Black Cherry--bland, almost plastic taste. Ick. 

Service is very friendly. Prices are pretty cheap. The place is very clean. I know they were closed for a while and just recently re-opened. So I wasn&#39;t expecting a large crowd there yet. The menu has salads, burgers, chicken, Italian Beef--lots to choose from."

The next day, we decided to go and visit the place. If was only a few minutes away from the hotel, inside a strip mall plaza next to a couple of other restaurants. 

The inside of the store looks a la 50&#39;s diner with plastic benches and round tables. No frills. Frozen in times.

When you walk in, you place your order at the counter by the entrance, pay, get a number, and wait for your food to come out. 

There are several TVs suspended from the walls showing some sports channels. 

Again, there is not a whole lot to say about the store. It&#39;s a bit dated and all. The food may be just a small tad more expensive than fast food but is of much, much better quality. Everything we tried there was good. And you just HAVE to try that meat lasagna. Yum!"

To me it&#39;s comfort food.  I have been eating here since I was 7 years old.  We used to have HOT lunch like 4 time a year at the elementary school that I went to and this was always my favorite one.  I loved the taste back then and 23 years later am still coming back for it.  I realize it&#39;s not the best pasta that I have ever had, but it&#39;s comforting and that&#39;s all that matters.  

Don&#39;t forget to order the Lemonade Ice, for your drink, it&#39;s truly fantastic... a bit sugary, but fabulous!

A great memory of this place was meeting michael jordan when he still lived in south barrington.  he rolled up in a black corvette.  of course at the time i was only 7 or 8 and didn&#39;t even know who he was ... but i do remember that though :)"

I shouldn&#39;t have worried!!  We got some really delicious pizza!  I ordered the meat lovers, but I did half with cheese only for the kids!  The meat lovers part came with WHOLE STRIPS of bacon!

The thin New York style pieces of pizza have remained consistent in taste and flavor through a remodel, ownership change and closing/reopening. Now they are opening a second location in Arlington Heights as well, and I hope they do well too!

I almost always get a slice of cheese pizza. Sometimes with pop or fruit punch. There are specials that make this affordable. I brought my boyfriend from New York and I think he thought it was one of the best NY style pizzas he&#39;s had since moving to Chicago. As a kid I loved the mostaccioli kids meal too. It came with garlic bread and a plain tomato sauce. I had a side salad with pizza recently and liked the fresh ingredients.  

The decor has a fun 50s style diner feel. I love sitting in one of the round booths that has a manikin waitress on roller skates holding a tray of plastic food about to spill on it! She&#39;s been doing that for years... There used to be an old jukebox that I believe has been updated to newer type of machine, which is a little bit of a loss of nostalgia. That said the windowed almost greenhouse feeling area still exists, which is especially fun to eat with a group of people, since it&#39;s a bit separated from the rest of the dining room. I lastly remember that Garibald&#39;s was great about sponsoring different events for local schools, so it&#39;s a good local establishment to support in the community."

Luckily, the pizza has stood the test of time and remains delicious to this day. It&#39;s unfortunate that several of their locations have closed (including the one that&#39;s reasonably close to me) but it&#39;s worth the trip to Hoffman Estates if you&#39;re in the area. We tend to come here every time we&#39;re in Schaumburg. The pizza is New York style - large chewy, cheesy slices.

The pizza was really tasty with a nice robust flavorful sauce and the sausage was outstanding. Cheese was really good and stringy as it should be. I wouldn&#39;t say it was New York style, but pretty darn good.  The crust could&#39;ve been a bit thinner, but I really can&#39;t complain.

Luckily the past few years we discovered there was still a Garibaldi&#39;s around and it still tastes just as great!  We called ahead and the pizza was ready when we got there, got a free drink by checking in on Yelp, aaaand took advantage of the Yelp certificate deal so lunch was tasty and cheap.  The pizza is always amazing.  The garlic bread takes me back to hot lunch days when you&#39;d always make sure to ask your mom for 50 cents so you could buy an extra garlic bread on Garibaldi&#39;s day because it was just that good.  These items are so good I&#39;ve rarely strayed from them, but a friend loves the cheese waffle fries.  Once I saw someone get the chicken fingers and they looked and smelled so good I had to try them myself next time, and they were definitely as good as they looked.

On a Wednesday night, me and two friends came here for a quick drink.  The bar tender is personable and makes a great drink!  

Thursday night is hip hop night which features a DJ and dancing, sometimes perks like free champagne for girls are offered too.

So the menu is changed from the last review. The restaurant was empty when we arrived, as expected for a hotel restaurant. So we sat where we liked.
We ordered nachos, Ginger Steak and Salmon. The waitress was unable to answer all our questions about the food so the chef came out.
The nachos had taco chips layered with cheese, jalapeno&#39;s, chopped tomatoes and covered with sour cream with two salsas served on the side: a tomato salsa and a green chili salsa.
The steak was an 8 oz. rib eyed broiled to a perfect medium rare covered with a ginger teriyaki sauce (offered on the side), with steamed vegetables and added Vesuvio potatoes that were nicely browned and seasoned.
The salmon was Alaskan, unusual for a restaurant of this type,grilled but still moist a tender.
Both entrees were served with a side salad made with romaine lettuce that was very good.
The food was excellent, but even better considering the prices. The steak was $15.50. The salmon was $15.95 and the nachos were $9.95.

It has been awhile since I wrote a review on yelp. However, today I feel like I owe it to the humanity, and I have to warn others about this horrible place. Also, I feel like calling out the other two or so reviewers on their bullshit. Clearly they are affiliated with this place.

I came in with my wife earlier today, thinking we could get a quick bite to eat - especially considering the fact that the place was not busy at all. The server was horrible at his job. He took our order of drinks and an appetizer when we came in. It took him at least 25 minutes to bring me my beer and the appetizer. Then we ordered our entrees - the entre burger and torta steak sandwich. Twenty minutes after we placed our order, the horrible server came up to us and asked if I could repeat my order (torta steak sandwich), as he had forgotten what I ordered. At that point, I was already frustrated and while telling him what I ordered, I told him that we are not happy with how long it is taking. Another half hour goes by and the horrible server brings out my wife&#39;s burger and tells me it will take a little longer for my sandwich because they are &#34;backed up,&#34; even though the place is empty. At this point, I am starving and I am pretty pissed, and the guy doesn&#39;t even ask if my wife wants ketchup or anything else for the burger. Another half hour goes by, and my sandwich is still not there, and my wife&#39;s burger is gone (I had to help her eat it because I was hungry). At this point, I ask for the bill as I am not willing to wait indefinitely for their stupid sandwich. They brought me the bill and despite the horrendous service they did not offer any discounts or anything to smooth things over.

I have to say that this is the worst service that I have ever experienced as a patron in any restaurant. I am saying this in light of the fact that I have been to restaurants in some developing countries where the servers did not even understand the importance of good service. In this place, on the other hand, it felt like these people purposefully wanted to give bad service, which is unacceptable. I understand that this is a new place, but I cannot see them succeeding with their current staff and I have to say that I have not been as pissed off as I am right now for quite some time.

As for the food, the things that I did eat were OK, but I never even got to try the sandwich that I ordered. Plus, no matter how good the food is, it is not worth putting up with the horrible service they provided in this place.

To summarize my review, DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT, I feel that it is my duty to warn you."

The decor and setting has style yet class to fit any gathering. The food is amazing not your typical bar food but bar food with a twist. I have had the Sliders and the pulled pork sandwich both of which are amazing and making me want to come back for more. You cannot beat the prices for the amount of food you receive. The menu is full of healthy choices so everyone should be able to find something to eat. The wait staff is very friendly and is a direct reflection of the management. The beer is good and cold unlike the atmosphere which is warm and inviting so why not venture from your normal hangouts and come check out the new place in town &#34;You will be surprised&#34;.

The majority of the patrons for the most part are latino friends of the bartender&#39;s who dress like west coast gangsters in t-shirts and baseball caps that came in consistently. Not a good look. Salsa Saturdays aren&#39;t helping either for the place. Basically it&#39;s la margaritas reincarnated in the body of this place.

When i got the actual thing, it was very plump and fresh. The tomatoes and lettuce were crisp and cold, very delicious. The chicken was juicy. The bread they used on the torta was also different than the one the picture had, which was a big plus. I&#39;ll come back for more next time I head over there!

We went to try Korean BBQ for the first time and came here. Upon arrival we waited a good 5 minutes before being greeted. We were then seated... It was a Sunday afternoon, and they had a party and a few other diners but otherwise the place was empty. 

My husband and I chose this location due to the Yelp reviews and location as we were very hungry. The menu wasn&#39;t translated at all, so I used google to look up the menu items listed in Korean... After ten minutes of sitting in the little room/table, we received tepid water... 

Perhaps it was a staffing issue for that day, but after that NO ONE checked on us... More customers arrived and were seated right away... My husband got agitated and after spending 25 minutes and only receiving water and no one returning to our area to check on us nor take our order, we decided to leave. 

I hope to try Korean BBQ in the future, but I will not be able to give this business another chance due to the lack of service and acknowledgement we received."

I liked the idea of cooking my own food, but the service was only ok. We weren&#39;t checked on very often, so our waters went unfilled. They gave us sliced garlic, but the pieces were too small to successfully navigate on the grill. When we were finally checked on, we asked for whole cloves of garlic, which the waiter did bring, along with a little aluminum foil bowl filled with oil to cook the sliced garlic in. It would have been nice if that were brought out with our food in the beginning. If my family goes back, we&#39;ll ask for that dish right away. None of the side dishes were explained or described, so for my family who had never been to a Korean restaurant like this before, we didn&#39;t really know what they were or what we were supposed to do with them. Our friends tried to help, but they only knew how to describe the things they liked. 

Overall, I would rate this restaurant 3.5 stars if that were an option. The food was tasty, but the service was not good."

The food is excellent. The marinade on the bulgogi was one of the better ones that I have tried. The sides were all delicious, and the sweet potato and carrot side is especially tasty. We also got an order of bi bim bap and that was satisfying. The star of the night were the spicy cold buckwheat noodles. (I apologize for forgetting the name of the dish, it&#39;s on the last page of the menu.) They were spicy and refreshing simultaneously, and the raddish and cucumber and hard boiled egg that were all mixed in (the egg was on top, the veggies were mixed in) provided a break in the texture and a burst of cool against the sauce. I dont know the next time we will be in Chicago, but I hope this place continues to thrive. It is awesome."

I came here with my family a few nights ago. We were the only people dining in at the restaurant for most of our visit. I believe we were waited on by one of the owners, the wife. I am deducing that she has little to no prior experience serving people because she was one of the most inhospitable people that I&#39;ve ever received service from. I understand that expectations should be lowered for service at an Asian restaurant, but there&#39;s only so much unfriendly and inadequate service that I will tolerate.

The menu is not entirely translated into English, and I had trouble figuring out what to order and how much food to order despite having dined at Korean BBQ restaurants before. I asked for the owner&#39;s recommendations. She just pointed at a bunch of the most expensive items on the menu. I asked her how many people an order of any individual item on the barbecue part of the menu will feed, and she replied that they&#39;re for one person. Which would have been fine, had the majority of the items in the BBQ section not fallen in the $20+ price point or if the bulgogi was the best bulgogi in the world.

When the food arrived... Boy was she right about it being for one person. A tiny plate of bulgogi that feeds one person is $25 here. We only ordered bulgogi and bacon from the BBQ portion of the menu which already came out to about $45, and then a noodle dish, bibimbop, and fried rice from the rest of the menu, all of which were suited for one individual size-wise. I think the bibimbop was actually the best part of the meal.

Throughout dinner, the owner only cleared plates whenever food was brought to the table. She never refilled our water. She never checked on us, and we had to flag her for everything, including the check. I could tell she hated us from the beginning when she tried to order two of the most expensive beef options for us and my mother told her to just order the bulgogi for us and not the other one. The owner was all about the up-sell and just didn&#39;t care if we had a good experience.

Including tax, the bill came out to a little above $90 for four of us and we were not full. I have eaten at Korean BBQ places in the city where you get a ridiculous amount of food for that price. I definitely will not be returning here in the future."

It&#39;s stereotypical, but true, that Korean customers get better service at Korean restaurants. I&#39;ve asked a lot of my friends on their experiences and they say that the service is lacking once they&#39;re seated and food is delivered. My experience is that once I&#39;m speaking and ordering in Korean, my water is filled and my appetizers are replenished when empty. This venue, however, was just lacking in service overall. Our waitress did not return after our meal was delivered. On top of that, we tipped 10% in cash (lucky to even get a tip for the terrible service), and they still charged my credit card 18% gratuity. There were only 4 of us, so I know for a fact that automatic gratuity should not have been applied. Chase took care of the variance, and will not be returning here again -

Services as this place was beyond what I expected. They were helpful and accommodating to each and every visitors. They even provide sheers to cut the meat slices in case their cuts were too big or if you just wanted to cut tiny pieces to share around.

The main items are prepared well, proper, balanced, traditionally made Korean food.  Today we had their galbi (short ribs) on wood chip grill... As for the galbi, it was great, BUT the smoke was overbearng even with the vent going. When it isn&#39;t as cold out, they can open some windows and the vent should work better (hopefully), but it was more than we could handle this evening.

One of the few remaining places where you get to cook meat over charcoal.

Prices are high and that&#39;s ok when the quality of the meat and the marinade is good.

After the last few tries, I&#39;m staying away.  Feels like something changed and the quality has gone down.  At best, it&#39;s becoming inconsistent and I&#39;d rather not take any more chances on what is a normally high priced meal.  (Average spend of over $50 a person).

That said, it is still one of the better Korean BBQ places in Chicagoland.  Mainly cause most of the other Korean places in Chicagoland are SO SO BAD.  So Bad that I&#39;ve resorted to buying, marinating and grilling at home rather than being frustrated with these places.

As for service, well, it&#39;s an old school Korean restaurant run by an elderly couple.  The owners can be gruff."

Plus, they use charcoal, which I think renders a much better flavor than the gas/metal hubcap situation at other places.

New Seoul is the only place my husband and I have tried marinated pork that we, ourselves, have cooked at the table (of course, all BBQ places have the beef - kalbi).  Holy good goodness - it&#39;s the best BBQ we&#39;ve had anywhere.  Ever.  Order the marinated pork, really.  All the other meats (marinated beef and plain bulgogi) were excellent too and the banchans were tasty - some truly stand-out better than other places, others par for the course.

In my opinion, it&#39;s a total dive - and accordingly I don&#39;t really think a good place for a newbie.  We took some friends to a place on Lincoln recently - I think now they&#39;d appreciate New Seoul, since they know what they&#39;re in for, which is a good thing because it&#39;s been too long and I want to go back.

I rarely get away without paying over $100 before tip....But, for the experience of a real charcoal grill, superbly marinated meat and the usual mix of Korean side dishes, I am happy to pay.

Went on memorial Monday for dinner, a family of 4 with 2 teenagers, we ordered 4 BBQ items, cooked fast, ate fast, kept refilling the side dishes and lettuce, ordered 2 more plates of BBQ meat, all food on table was wiped out. Except the bones for the dogs, which they will be so happy and enjoy as much as we did. 

Tom the owner, I think that&#39;s his name, is very nice, I think the other lady might be his wife, who doesn&#39;t speak much English, but who cares, didn&#39;t come for her. 
Then there&#39;s a young man whom we saw for the first time of the many years that we have been here. He might be the son? Perfect English, friendly service, we feel good that we can communicate with someone. 

N we think this place has the best quality of meat of all the Korean restaurants that we go too. Most people or places have the marinated meat which you can use a not so great grade or not so fresh meat, sorry people. We like our meat non marinated so we can get the real flavor of the meat. If the meat is not good, we can taste it right away, which I can name a few restaurants easily. The meat here is fresh, juicy, n flavorful. They have the marinated kalbi, bulgogi n all that too, we only ordered 1 out of the 6 items we did. 

Other places might have bigger names, busier, but this is the best. 
Quality of meat is always consistent. 
The addition of a staff that speaks English is definitely a plus. 

With that being said, Korean BBQ lunch again today.
N it&#39;s at that place known for giving lots of side dishes, it&#39;s impressive but nothing compared to New Seoul.
Way to go new Seoul!!"

We were then placed in the middle of the restaurant and it got really cold with the door opening and closing every time someone entered place and the was really small. The food was overpriced for the portions we get and didn&#39;t even filled us up and it didn&#39;t taste good at all too and the ventilation sucks because it got so smokey in the restaurant and it stabled up our clothes. After we paid for the bill and tipped them they asked us for more tip because it was their policy or whatever.

We searched for it then this restaurant poped up, and this grandpa &amp; grandma sweet place has given us an extremely wonderful experience!

We walked in on 11am, the time they just opened. Everything looks peaceful and clean. The owner (just in my opinion, cuz his photo showed on The restaurant&#39;s Yelp album) welcomed and set us down. We all love this place, it&#39;s home-made style and let us felt very relax and comfortable.

Now, back to the food. THEY JUST SO AWESOME &amp; AUTHENTIC!!! We had the Bul Gol Ki (which the others highly recommend on Yelp and it&#39;s so tasty!), the spicy pork (which the others highly recommend on Yelp and it&#39;s so tasty!), the cold noodles without soup (which...you know what I&#39;m going to say). They all very delicious and with huge portion!

Actually, the smoke doesn&#39;t bother us so much, maybe because there just two of us eating and the exhauster at the top did a great job.

I love this place to pieces. The food stacks up to some of the best joints in Korea. Could it be classed up a bit? With bowls that look like they come from Ikea and wooden chopsticks, the answer is: absolutely. 

But the truth is that the flavor profile here is on the money. It&#39;s an authentic experience and something you wouldn&#39;t expect from Mount Prospect. Not saying that Mount Prospect is anything to sneeze at, but this place could clean up a lot of places in downtown Chicago. 

I mean, look. You get the banchan, you get the sang-chu, you get that beautiful caramelization on the galbi and the diced up onions over a bed of lettuce. It&#39;s that level of completeness and that authenticity that makes this place special. 

Try it out. The place looks like it&#39;s run by a small family, so you know they bring a passion for food."

It has a homemade feel to it, and I enjoyed their banchan (always an important aspect of a Korean restaurant). My only gripe is that they have inconsistent service. It took forever to get the bowls of rice (they asked my party if we needed some after we asked earlier), and I requested additional plates of banchan. However, the father of the restaurant gave us some complimentary soup (once again, not sure if that&#39;s included in our meals) as a gesture of kindness.

Food was good. But I will say this: if you&#39;re seated on Table 7, I wouldn&#39;t look up. It was dusty, so it was off putting. Portions are kind of small as well. If you were strictly ordering an BBQ entree (you need to order 2 in order to use the BBQ), I would recommend adding appetizers. Also the grill is something I&#39;m not used to -- a lot of the places I&#39;ve been before have more of a griddle so that the meat doesn&#39;t fall through into the coals. Here, with this kind of grill, I noticed my garlic slices kept falling into the coal. Just something to think about.

I would recommend this place as a no frills, come with your friends joint to enjoy BBQ. Don&#39;t expect much except for homemade style.

P.S. Apparently the Gangnam Star, Psy, has visited this joint. You&#39;ll see his photo with the owners near the entrance."

The 18 of us had the back room reserved all to ourselves. The walls were rather plain and the room rather uninteresting except for a very prominent &#34;No Smoking&#34; sign which a number of people commented on how out of place it appeared. And soon there was smoke indeed. At each seat there were 2 glass bowls. One had a salty peanut-flavored oil. The other had a roasted sesame and garlic flavor. These would be used to dip the meats for added flavor and savoriness. 

We spent some time looking at menus. For a while I even thought the waitress forgot us, but then we got service and placed our orders. In just a few minutes, the table rapidly filled with an assortment of greens, kimchi, and other fixin&#39;s for our KBBQ. And of course they brought out blackened kettles of flaming oak wood charcoal and placed them on the table for us.

I think the waitresses didn&#39;t speak good English, so they were unable to really explain all the menu items to us. I picked pork rib tips. While I received pork, I think my order may have been the spicy marinaded pork instead. Regardless, I roasted a sample piece from the platter anyway and after one taste, I couldn&#39;t complain. I observed Korean BBQ veteran Dee M. take a leaf of lettuce and wrap up some grilled meat with some toppings and eat it like a &#34;Korean Taco&#34;, as he called it.

Pretty good idea. So I did the same and I think I single-handedly cleared a whole head of loose-leaf lettuce in the process. One of the best toppings that complemented the meat were these thin white, round slices of pickled radish. Their shape and color sort of reminded me of the medicated acne wipes I used as a teen... Anyway, I grilled them till they turned slightly beige and they went perfectly with the marinaded pork - or all by themselves. We finished at least 2 bowls of those radish slices by me and they kept bringing more for us.

Quite a filling meal with rice and all the delightful toppings like sprouts, potato nuggets or these thin, grass-like shredded green onions that also gave the meat slices a delectable taste.

I&#39;d give this place 5 stars but the waitress forgot us towards the end, plus she forgot to put in our 10% off Yelp discount till I came over and reminded her. 

No dessert menu, but we did receive plates full of sliced fresh oranges as a treat at the end. I also get the feeling most people were too full for anything more besides the main courses.

And in case you decide to go, don&#39;t wear your good clothes. You&#39;ll come home smelling like Korean BBQ. A whiff of my fleece jacket the next morning still reminded me of the wonderful meal I experienced."

After we were seated and given menus, no one came around to take our order for about 20 minutes.  We kept trying to flag someone down, only to be ignored. After we finally had a chance to order, there was no banchan brought to us, even after our food was brought out.  Again, we had to flag someone down to bring banchan and even that took a while. It was finally brought to the table with an attitude and an eyeroll and I am still trying to figure out what we did to deserve such treatment. During dinner, we felt like we were constantly being watched, as if they wanted us to leave asap. The thing is, they were being incredibly friendly to the other tables who were obviously friends and/or regulars. Seeing that made me even more upset regarding our service. 
The food was okay. The kalbi was good but the ventilation was terrible.  The chadol portion was a little skimpy for the price.  The al chigae (cod roe stew) and kalbi tang were good and the portions were generous. That is the only reason for 2 stars.

New Seoul is where my whole, very large family would gather for epic family dinners.  Half the enormous bill was normally for liquor...

Anyhow, New Seoul does Korean BBQ right.  Their Kalbi (marinated short ribs) are excellent marinated, tender, and grill just right over the coals at the table.  Banchan, aka side dishes, are delicious and fresh.  One note is that this place is not all-you-can-eat (I know, sadface) and the prices are tad higher than other Korean BBQ places.  But heck, its worth it.

While a haven for Koreans craving authentic food, I came here with non-Korean (Caucasian) family friends, and they loved every bit of the food.  Finally, the doenjang jjigae that comes at the end of the meal is done just right, with enough spiciness and bean paste flavor, but not overwhelmingly hot.  Service is excellent and friendly.

The octopus was way too chewy and could not be cut with a knife.  Even the bulgogi wasn&#39;t that good.  Then you add how awful the service was and it makes you shocked that the place was in business.  Unprofessional staff that did not seem like they wanted to be there.

It&#39;s super authentic Korean BBQ.  I&#39;d not recommend coming here if it&#39;s just you and your S.O or someone with a wimpy appetite.  You simply won&#39;t get to enjoy enough BBQ offerings.  Come with a group and enjoy Korean BBQ the way it&#39;s meant to be done.  I&#39;ve come with a fairly large work group and had a blast.  The style of eating is friendly and casual.  You have to be ok with getting a little messy and come with the understanding that anything you bring into New Seoul *will* smell like Korean BBQ by the end of the night.  You *will* take this smell with you to your car, your home, and possibly to work the next day.  You&#39;ve been warned... leave the jacket in the car and get ready for some smokey goodness.  The food here is fantastic and the waitstaff is great when you can hold their attention (this is true of *most* Korean places).

For those of you unfamiliar with Korean BBQ and the proper protocol, just wear your confused face and the waitress will do the work for you.  For those in the know, be sure to assign a cooker and a backup.  Nobody likes overcooked and charred meat that gets neglected while the cooker is busy stuffing his/her own face.

My typical visit goes like this:
- ensure that everyone attending will be hungry
- warn them to leave their fancy clothes and jackets in the car
- if cold or wet, dash from the car to the front door.
- sit everyone down and explain that the menu will be &#34;family style&#34; and to determine if any food allergies or aversions exist.
- order your first and second bottles of soju along with the hamul pajun and the Asian beer of your choice
- marvel at the banchan that fill the table
- do your first shot with your first servings of food
- order the beef and pork goodness for the table (don&#39;t worry you can order as you go if you&#39;re not sure of everyone&#39;s hunger)
- prime the grill grate with that fatty rib
- teach everyone proper roll making and face stuffing technique.  also go through the sauces and what they go best with.
- cook, eat, and have a great time (shots as needed!!)

Remember to pace the cooking (and drinking).

The best part of bringing office visitors here is that it is super budget friendly compared to the other nearby franchise restaurant offerings.  Be sure to *nicely* ask for a copy of the handwritten receipt if you need to expense the meal.  Tip your waitstaff for the great time and invite everyone back upon their next visit."

The food was great!  We normally order bulgogi because it&#39;s easier to cook and more tender than other cuts.  This place gives each table a huge selection of delicious side dishes (banchan).  It would be nice if they made Korean-Chinese dishes such as jajamyun, jjampong, or gampongi BUT THEY DON&#39;T!

Only thing that they should improve on is the price.  They charge roughly $20 for a plate of meat.  And you have to order 2 plates if you want to grill it yourself, which if you don&#39;t defeats the purpose of going to a Korean BBQ joint!  For 2 people, 1 plate of meat is too little but 2 plates is too much so come hungry LoL!  Overall good experience!  I will definitely return next time I want my Korean fix!"

We set the night (and the grill) on fire. Did anyone else find the &#34;no smoking&#34; sign in the dining room ironic?

This was my and my guests&#39; introduction to Korean BBQ and we all left feeling satisfied by the food and the company. For three straight hours we roasted, toasted and told stories.

My father and I took the advice of our waitress, went with both of her suggestions and split it up amongst ourselves. One was succulent pork ribs and the other was garlic soaked beef slices. A side of rice and various dipping sauces and lettuce stuffers accompanied the main dish. We tried a little bit of everything and loved every bite.

The best part? In my opinion, it is the fact that you are served raw meat and get to personally cook it to your liking on their coal grill in the middle of the table. Aren&#39;t feeling so adventurous? You can ask them to cook it for you in the kitchen and give it the authentic touch.

There are only two negative things I can say about this place. First, overpriced cans of pop. They run you $2. Second, too much smoke. We had about twenty people furiously cooking up a storm and the large dining area was quickly overpowered. Considering that six large vents were running, it shouldn&#39;t have been so thick. But you would probably be set if you came during nicer weather and opened the door, or if you had just a few guests in one of their cozy, private booths."

How goes it fellow foodies of the burbs? Weary? In need of hot soup, crunchy vegetables, salted meats? Have I found the Korean hotspot for you. These guys don&#39;t cut corners.  In fact, they don&#39;t have an excess of room to stand in! But of boy, this unassuming exterior hosts a snug cozy atmosphere. 

Once seated around  that grill, it&#39;ll be just like those campfire nights with your sweetie.  Might I recommend adding some heat to your finely sliced beef on that grill there.  Roast them meats, roll them into one of them crunchy leaves. Maybe a little bean sauce if you&#39;ve got the dexterity. Then slide that in your mouth there.   An array of sauces, and unique Korean items to taste. Go ahead taste them. Be docile and open, try them chopsticks out. There&#39;s the mushrooms, and kim chee, them&#39;s my favorite. There&#39;s rice to add to your soup, or to your Korean &#34;leafy burritos&#34;. 

You can&#39;t go wrong. I wish I could tell you about desert, but if you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ll probably just be too full. Just smile, pay that check, and make your next reservation."

We had the galbi and quail served with lettuce to wrap, sauces, and many little dishes.  I really liked the galbi, the quail was a bit difficult for us non-experts to cook correctly on the hot grill.  I loved trying all of the little dishes and they were all really good.  The spicy tofu soup was good as well.  All in all, the place was clean, cozy, and the service was good.  If there are only 2 people I think 2 orders of galbi may be too much so I would recommend one order of galbi and share a soup or other dish (unless you&#39;re really hungry)."

I had the Bi Mi Bop (sp?) for lunch and I didn&#39;t realize it was a cold dish, which threw me off a bit, but overall the meal was great especially with all the side dishes! I paid about $8.

I than came back with my boyfriend and had their korean bbq and ordered 2 dish of marinated short ribs and 1 dish of marinated beef. Cooked on the charcoal fire it was extremely tasty with a hint of sweetness when you ate them. I truly enjoyed my meal and so did my boyfriend! The service was great and everyone was polite!

Korean bbq can get a bit pricey though. The bill was about $60.

but back to the galbi.. soft, juicy, packed with flavor.. a little on the expensive side for galbi in chicagoland.. probably even more expensive than boo il galbi on bryn mawr.. but its worth it...

it seems that an old couple run it.. with their daughter (i hope its their daughter) because while the two old folks were running around serving tables and refilling waters and teas she was sitting on the laptop in the front probably facebooking... so if she is just a random hire.. let her ass go! but the service is top notch.. I feel like I am eating at my grand parents place.. they are very informal and very family feely which I love and it seems like I have been eating there for years but in reality I have only gone once and hope to go again but the hike to this place sucks.. but I will sure try to make my way back!"

Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I love me some San Soo Gab San and Cho Sun, but the drive plus wait at both are rather long.  Too long when you&#39;re hungry.  UNBEARABLE when you&#39;re starving.  

So, I was *stoked* to find out from a friend that this place is authentic as they come, a small business with great following, and also had charcoal grills to use, all very close to home.  Charcoal grills are the secret and authenticity to how the galbi comes out perfectly. Well, that, and a good person manning the &#39;que while you stuff your face. 

The galbi is awesome, although I did notice that they give a little bit less serving size than SSGS.  They give the right amount of panchan, which is so great on the conscience, as I do feel quite guilty having so much leftover from SSGS. Also, the panchan selection was quite fresh.

They have several booths that are semi enclosed for a small private groups, and I must say, the service ****R.O.C.K.S**** here in comparison to other kbbq spots.  The ladies are very sweet and helpful, and they don&#39;t get mad at you even though there is a language barrier. It&#39;s so nice that they don&#39;t roll you eyes when you mispronounce something or need help with the all- Korean menu.  Instead they smile a genuine smile, and do the best that they can to help you.  

Highly recommend.  Give this mom and pop place a try!"

Having lunch for one on a Wednesday doesn&#39;t warrant the full-on Korean table top BBQ experience, but it doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t enjoy a good Korean meal.

I asked my server for suggestions, and she gladly obliged. After waxing poetically on the merits of lean beef, chicken, or slightly &#39;fattier&#39; pork entrees, I decided on my server&#39;s favorite, the spicy (slightly fattier) pork dish. In just a few minute&#39;s time a sizzling platter arrived at my table with the usual accompaniment of kimchee, pickled radish, cucumbers, and others too numerous to mention. My server stated she had the kitchen trim the pork more lean for me, the &#34;Western customer.&#34; I appreciated the concern for my well-being, however unnecessary it may have been.

Bottom line, the pork was delicious, and the sides an excellent balance to the entree dish. I was amused that I merited attention as the &#34;Western customer,&#34; though I certainly appreciated the menu suggestions and care I received. I look forward to returning when I find myself again in the Chicago area."

It reminded me of the many Korean BBQ restaurants I used to frequent in Los Angeles. The highlight here compared to some other restaurants is the side dishes they provide at the beginning of the meal - excellent quality and fresh. Tastes like they made it fresh, and not out of a jar from H-Mart.

Most items are fairly priced, with the exception of the Kalbi (Galbi), which costs an outrageous $22/plate!

For those of you unfamiliar with Korean food, I went with several coworkers who have never tasted Korean food, and the Bulgogi ($10) and Galbi ($22) were easily crowd favorites. They also really seemed to like the idea of the unlimited side dishes.

I also had the kimchi chigae (soup) @ $8, and the Soon tofu (spicy tofu) @ $8. Both are my personal favorites, but didn&#39;t seem to please the taste-buds of my fellow coworkers so much due to the slightly sour flavor derived from the kimchi in the soups.

Anyway, lots of ranting, but the synopsis is simple. Check this place out! It may not look like much from the outside, but the food is terrific."

The food is good as any other Korean BBQ joints around Chicago land &amp; even (dare I say it?) LA.  The star of this place is the Kalbi! What makes this place shine versus other Korean bbq is they use real wood versus gas/propane gas.  The hardwood charcoal gives that extra flavor. (Most of bbq places in the burbs use gas)

The food is always consistently good, from the marinated meat (beef, pork, chicken or whatever) &amp; for  those who are brave enough to go beyond the bbq meat they have an excellent hearty, yummy for your tummy soup(s)-spicy beef vegetable soup, ox tail soup, kimchee gigae to name a few.

One thing about Korean cuisine is that you don&#39;t have to be a meat eater to enjoy Korean food -Bi Bim Bop, Chap-chae &amp; all those side dishes!!!! Yum Yum!

My only criticism of this place is the air vent above the bbq pit, needs to be clean I was in for lunch last week and noticed that the lip of the air vent had grease collected around it  yuk!  (On my previous visit grease dropped on my head and on my food).

Mr Kim &amp; staff are putting out good authentic Korean food &amp; my husband and I can&#39;t be happier. Yum Yum!"

Food wise, I tried the Gal Bi (Beef Short Ribs) and the Duk Gal Bi (Chicken Short Ribs).  Both were well marinated and very good.  The panch&#39;an (side dishes) were also fairly abundant, about ten dishes ranging from raw radishes to the usual items like kimchi.

Ambiance and service are the only areas I thought were a bit lacking.  I wouldn&#39;t consider this a great &#34;date&#34; place and didn&#39;t have the ambiance for good one-on-one dining.  The service I received was very good; however, the table next time me struggled to get service and I could hear other complaints about service from other patrons in the dining room.

Sometimes hard to get assistance, but once they&#39;re at your table they are super friendly and heplful.

What I love is the Korean BBQ here, expecially the Galbi (marinated). While most Korean bbq restaurants have a gas fire and an built into the table, these table have giant holes in them. Why the hole you ask? They place a bucket of hot, burning charcoal int he middle of the table. The buckets sink most of the way into the table but rests just above. A metal griddle is palced over the charcoal. While the marinade is extremely delicious to start with, the taste of fresh barbecue (with generous portion sizes) over charcoal is exquisite! there is a definite smoky taste and the meat cooks evenly which is rare when using a gas fire burner. The barbecue is the best Korean barbecue in the area, simply declious! You&#39;ll also receive hte customary Korean side dish parade as well as a warm Daen Jang soup (spicy miso soup, different from Japanese miso soup).

The only downside was the stove and frame. 
It seemed the fire there was too strong so be ready to face smoke when you BBQ. Also, the frame was easy to get burned so was the meat. If you don&#39;t flip over your meat or veggie often, they will get burned fast and easily.

I cannot say enough good things about this gem. However tiny in size, seating approximately 30 maximum, this Korean BBQ restaurant makes up for it in quality of food and service. The owners and wait staff are uber friendly and will answer any questions you have regarding the menu or how to cook your BBQ properly.

All the meat is perfectly marinated and so tasty. They also do chop chae, a noodle dish, which a lot of BBQ places don&#39;t ... super bonus. I love the fact that they chill their beer mugs, so when you pour there is the faintest hint of beer slushie on top.

Me and my husband like Korean food and all we wanted was some Kalbi for him and Kimchee tofu soup for me.  As soon as the owner walks in and checked in with us, he was  drunk and wasted. He pretty much tricked us on getting galbi for both even though we only want 1 order. He kept forcing us to have two and that he will give me a Kimchee soup for free if I agree. So thinking we got a good deal with free soup, we stayed. But the galbi was underwhelming and the free Kimchee soup was this tiny little soup with almost no other ingredient except flavored water. The owner kept walking in saying weird awkward things every 5 minutes and it was a chore just to keep him out so we can eat."

Yeah, I&#39;ve still yet to pick up that GPS device. I&#39;ve been busy damnit. So my point is though, is that it&#39;s pretty easy to find if you want to venture out here and you don&#39;t live out in Des Plaines. 

I ordered their bulgogi and a seafood pancake with no fish. I think there was a misunderstanding because on their menu it said fish, shrimp, blah blah blah but I hate cooked fish so I pointed out that I want no fish and the pancake came out completely devoid of any protein, just a bunch of onions. You Suck. I didn&#39;t assume that no fish meant no shrimp nor other seafood to other people. Would I order it again? Absolutely not, there&#39;s much better in Chicago.

As if that weren&#39;t enough, the owners are absolutely adorable!  The service is quick and attentive and they are so friendly and welcoming of our random questions.  

I highly recommend the baby octopus as it was some of the most tender I&#39;ve had in a long time.

The bad news is you&#39;ll come home reeking of BBQ out of every pore, which might limit the moments/occasions you can eat here.

The menu is huge and we each ordered a pork dish. After we ordered the waitress immediately brought out a zillion bowls of random food. We kind of just stared at it and then back at her, which is when she went through everything and showed us what to use it for. Once our meat arrived she also threw the first few slices on the grill to explain how to cook it and the approx. time it takes so it&#39;s not overdone.

Overall really knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff and a unique dining experience. Great food. Expect a long, leisurely dinner though- we were &#34;finished&#34; a good 30 minutes before we got our check. Not that we minded. We just kind of kept throwing stuff on the grill to pick at."

Service is still top notch.  Today I had their Gal Bi Tang which is tender short rib, served with green onions, noodles and an egg garnish all in a fiery broth.  The verdict:  absolutely delicious!!!!  For a cold day like today, this really hit the spot.  Yummy!  

I also had the seafood pancake (hae mool pa jun) which is almost like a seafood fritter filled with delicate pieces of fish, squid, shrimp and green onion served with a tangy soy sauce.  Crispy, mouth-watering, seafood filled goodness!!!!  

What I also love about this place is the fact that you can order your food super spicy hot (if you dare) or mild (if you don&#39;t feel like having a &#34;burning butt&#34; a few hours later).  Either way, they are very accomodating which is awesome, especially since everything is cooked fresh to order unlike some other restaurants.  My wife can&#39;t handle very spicy food, but she loves Korean food.  Yes, she is that brave, haha!  However, here at New Seoul, they at least give her an option for mild if she just wants to take a break from super hot.

I can&#39;t wait to go back and try another new item off their extensive menu.  Of course, I&#39;ll keep you updated so don&#39;t be sad.  In the meantime, get your ass over here and experience this new level of Korean cuisine at its best for yourself!!!!  Oh by the way, the owner read my last review and upon this visit, presented me with.....potato salad!!!!  It&#39;s great that the owner, Mr. Kim and Un-Jun are so open to suggestions.

I came here for my boss&#39; birthday celebration, and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. There were various dishes of banchan though I thought there could have been a wider variety. Nevertheless the banchan was still delish! Now on to the actual BBQ. The meats were perfectly marinated and cut into small pieces which I appreciated very much. No one wants to grill a huge piece of meat and then have to cut it themselves. Too much work when all you want to do is eat your deliciously grilled meaty creation. The meat was tender and flavorful. 

I was surprised by the excellent service. The waiter came and replaced the grill pan about three times so that the meats won&#39;t be grilled on a burnt pan. The service overall was fabulous.

The service was above average and the food was good, but why is it so hard to find a Korean restaurant that is clean and presentable.  If you&#39;re looking to eat bbq as your primary dish, try your luck somewhere else.  Party of 3 bill came out to over $100.. for lunch."

Finally made it here for dinner after numerous lunches and i gotta say: it&#39;s tough to beat. Yes, we known SSGS has a million panchan, we known hae woon dae and even Garden have live coals. But New Seoul has SOUL. Owned by a elderly couple, this joint has a smorgasbord of cuts, not just your daeji bulgogi, your kalbi and bulgogi, they&#39;ve got briskets, they&#39;ve got beef tongue, chadol baegi tripe, flanks, and the hot trend of trends: sam gyup sal. coupled with live coals and an excellent iron grill and the hard to find thin-slice daikon (which i use, in addition to lettuce, as a wrap), this place can do no wrong."

I was coming back from Downtown Chicago with my date, but due to the heavy downpour, traffic was horrendous.  Sad to say, we got to the restaurant almost 30 minutes past closing time.  Believing that the restaurant was closed, we walked in hoping to get something to go at the very least if possible (fingers were crossed).  To my surprised, not only did the owner invite us in with open arms, but insisted that we dine in.  What a great service and a kind owner!

My date and I ordered Soon Doo Boo and Korean BBQ Galbi.  Both were more than stellar on my scale and deserves more than just the mere five star that yelp has to offer.  I give this place 10 stars if that were an option."

When we arrived to the place, it was closed!  what is it with restaurants in the Chicago area being closed on a Sunday?  I get hungry on Sundays too!  Disappointed, we went in search of another place and ended up at New Seoul BBQ. 

Seeing that this is a Korean BBQ joint, we took off our coats and whatever we could before entering to make sure we didn&#39;t stink up our clothes.  The chill in the air went right into our bones, so we we ran to the entrance. 

When we walked inside, I noticed the upper half of the place was filled with a thick cloud of hazy and wispy smoke. Who let off a smoke grenade in here?  Oh, it&#39;s coming from the other customers&#39; BBQ.  It didn&#39;t seem like the exhausts were turned on, hence the smoke cloud.  Granted there were only 2 other occupied tables, were the owners trying to cut cost?  If so, bad move.  What were the chances of dying from carbon monoxide poisoning with a wad of kimchi in my mouth?  I&#39;d say pretty high.  

We were seated at one of the booths.  As we waited for our food, the visibility was getting pretty bad from the smoke so we asked the server to turn on the exhaust fan hovering above our table.  Then it got worse before it got better.  Right when the exhaust was turned on, a rush of continuous cold air came down from the vent, so there I was, sucking in smoke and freezing my ass off...I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been so uncomfortable at a restaurant.  Eventually, the exhaust kicked-in after the warm-up period, but I was already annoyed by that point.

The food was pretty good and the bon chon that came with it was plentiful.  The portions were generous and even though I  ordered the noodles, I was still given a bowl of rice.  That was a nice touch.  After all that smoke poisoning though, we didn&#39;t want to do BBQ.  I give the food a 4, and the atmosphere a 1.  So let&#39;s just average it out and give this place a 2.5.  I wanted to give a higher rating, but the atmosphere was so lousy that I couldn&#39;t really enjoy the food."

Can&#39;t beat  $2 draft beers on Thursday!

Food - decent.   Boneless wings were very good.  Loaded waffle fries - yum.  Pork sliders were good.   Burgers - great options but no matter how you order it (I ordered medium both times) it will be cooked well- done.

(we left her the change....which she was lucky she even got.)

this is just one out of a hundred times....but 
still going to come, like i said, we enjoy this establishment, your servers just need WAY better customer service and training."

First and foremost, I never even gave this place the opportunity to seat me and my 4 other friends that decided to give this place a shot. Mind you, we only were there for maybe 6 minutes max. In those 6 minutes we saw one of the waitresses running around the restaurant screaming and causing quite the scene. We couldn&#39;t quite hear what she was saying, probably due to the fact that she was severely intoxicated by what one of the customers there that WALKED OUT had said. She apparently had been drinking with many of the customers, and from what they told us it&#39;s a frequent thing here for her. NOW, what may have caused this? This waitress physically slapped a customer! Now mind you, a comment may have made her upset, but I would never slap someone. From what the other customers that began to walk out had told me is that the person she slapped was a regular that never even touched her, but she thought it necessary to slap him! She was continuously walking around the restaurant, and where was management?! 

    For fear of being slapped ourselves for maybe mistakenly saying something wrong, or how we said it or how our facial expressions may have looked, we immediately left. We will never be returning to this place! A word to the company, it would be best to make sure that the customers are the ones only consuming alcohol and after that scene where many of your customers witnessed that, better hope she isn&#39;t even in the building after that!"

One of the first of us to arrive spotted a free table and grabbed it, only to be quickly chased away by a manager. &#34;We&#39;ve got a waiting list for tables, sorry&#34;.

Ok, so we played ball, that&#39;s cool. Put our name on the list. Waited from 8:45 until 9:30. At 9:30 we were told a table was available. Were led back to the table only to find a group of other guys who had been hanging out at the bar grabbed the table as soon as it opened up. Instead of informing those guys there was a list, the hostess awkwardly said she must have been mistaken, and walked us back up front.

We attempted to find out what the deal was from the hostesses up front, and a manager who was running  around, asking when we could expect a table, and were blown off by everyone - most of the front door staff being too busy goofing off together to try and help us out, or explain what happened. It was pretty clear to us that the people involved didn&#39;t have the backbone to try and tell the other guys the table was ours, and we drew the short-end of the that interaction.

Nuts to this place. If you come when it&#39;s quiet, its a solid 6/10, but if you accidentally come when it&#39;s busy, their attitude is pretty clearly that you can GFY. House is full, who cares if some people are mishandled? Except those are the same neighborhood people who come by during the quiet hours for a beer and a meal.

We won&#39;t be back."

I went here on a Wednesday for the half price pizza and $3 drinks. The waitress was nice enough to make sure I knew which drinks were and were not on the $3 list. The service was pretty prompt despite the place being pretty crowded. The pizza was decent, and the chicken springrolls were pretty good as well. 

The drinks weren&#39;t bad. I got an Appletini which was not $3 but was pretty strong and tasted fine. My friend got some sort of mule, which was pretty sweet and pleasant. 

Overall, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d come for the food without a deal, but the deals they have are pretty dang good. THe beer is good."

The dining room side is smaller.  Each of the booths in the bar area has a flatscreen TV - so an added bonus if you are there to watch a game.  They also have some great specials on different nights so check out their website for details. And if you sign up for their emails they usually send out 1-2 great coupons a week. 

I like their menu and how you can make any salad into a wrap and any burger can be changed to a chicken breast sandwich or veggie burger at no charge. Their wings are excellent, nice &amp; crispy outside with variety of sauces to choose from.  Their burgers are very good (and very messy with all those yummy toppings!) and they actually know how to cook a burger to the temp requested. I&#39;d say they are a bit skimpy on the side of fries that comes with the burger/sandwich - about half of what you would get at another restaurant for the price you are paying.  Their own brewed beers are all quite good, as well.

The place is often hopping so the service isn&#39;t always very attentive from your specific server - but they have a variety of folks bringing out the food, filling water glasses, manager making the rounds regularly to check on the customers, etc. You might wait a bit to place your order if you aren&#39;t ready the first time your server comes by but aside from that you shouldn&#39;t feel neglected with everyone else coming around."

As I enjoy watching sports out in the city, I can appreciate a modern sports bar with an inviting setup. BAH does this all in the small town of Roselle.

Unassuming from the outside located in a small strip mall, the Ale House is a sports world with a wide selection of beers on tap. I come at lunch, not that that is an excuse, so I have not tried from the beer selection, but the menu looks good. They have drink and food specials all week long. There is a large bar area, tall boy tables throughout the middle, private-ish booths around the walls. There is also a second floor area. Large enough for everyone and good viewing angles for catching the game.

Plenty of televisions, good beer, and good food. I had the pizza and the southwest fiesta chicken wrap the two times I have been here. The pizza was just average and I was able to eat it all on my own. The wrap was good and came with a side of fries that were on point. 

If I lived in the area and wanted to come out and watch a game this is the spot I would be at."

We were quickly seated but it took a while for our waitress to greet us. Wife and I ordered a beer, kids ordered water and lemonade and we put in an order for 10 wings - half Parmesan garlic, half plain. Beers arrived quickly, kids drinks did not. 

Wings came out fast but we were not given plates or silverware or napkins. The Parmesan garlic sauce was a gross looking flavorless thin sauce. We requested blue cheese for dipping the other wings and what we got was a flavorless cup of something white that was indistinguishable in flavor. 

We were almost done eating them when our waitress arrived with kids drinks and took our dinner order. We complained about not getting plates and how we had to share napkins. Wife and I ordered another beer. 

For food, I ordered the Farmhouse Burger cooked medium, wife orders a Goat on a Date wrap, sons ordered kids boneless chicken wings and the All You Can Eat fish. 

Food arrived. Not impressed. My burger was well done and had extremely bitter burnt spots. The meat (dry) lacked flavor or any salt. The fries were soggy and greasy. 

My sons fish was overcooked he said and dry. The chicken was very greasy - a light squeeze saw grease dripping out of it. The wrap was unimpressive as well. 

This is a place that positions itself as a sports bar but it was basically impossible to watch any of the games. We sat in a booth and the TVs were high on the side wall above our heads. There were no TVs in the direction of where the booths faced. It seems like it&#39;d be impossible to watch a game from most of the tables and booths. 

Beer menu is extensive and the Bulldog Pale Ale I had was decent. It wouldn&#39;t be a bad place to go for drinks except that it&#39;s in an area highly patrolled by police so not somewhere you&#39;d want to be caught drunk driving. 

The food was really undesirable and based on the terribly bitter burnt flavors on my burger it&#39;s not a place id recommend for dinner. Waitress didn&#39;t seem to have basic job skills, such as bringing silverware and being visible.

This place obviously does not enforce Illinois smoking laws of requiring people be 15 feet from an entrance. People were standing right next to the door smoking, which meant my family had to walk through a wall of smoke to leave the building. Disgusting. I don&#39;t know why restaurants are so afraid to enforce this law."

Negative experience guaranteed if you come here

Long review:

So....I&#39;ve been here three times in the last year (first time was for my birthday) and let me tell you in all honesty, all three times were truly a horrible experience. I don&#39;t know where to start..The food.....the service......just so negative and sloppy.  I&#39;ve never felt like I was bothering my waitress until I came here. Like I&#39;m sorry you have to work....? Very unwelcoming feeling in this bar. It&#39;s definitely not Cheers.

Don&#39;t get me started on the food bc I&#39;m going to throw up just thinking about it. I should have taken a pic.  Everything they do is just so obviously the minimum effort required that I am embarrassed for them. 

Save your money. Sloppy all around and they have a juke box but don&#39;t allow it to be used LOL! It&#39;s like they don&#39;t want my money. 

I learned my lesson, I won&#39;t be back."

I did call to let them know that both my friend and I got sick this evening after sharing bone-in wings and the nachos. The person on the phone (Alan) was friendly and ensured me that he would alert the manager. The 1st wing I ate tasted odd but I really was unsure of the taste because my friend had ordered the sauce/flavor. Well now I know. I hope no one else got sick. Here&#39;s to hoping management addresses the cause and prevents any future illnesses. On a side note our waitress checked on us frequently and was attentive to our needs.

We told the waitress and she got the manager and he was incredibly rude stating, &#34;No one in the back has long hair.&#34; Seriously! I&#39;m completely done with this place!

Now the food is good but I was disgusted by my server Ally. Every time she brought us drinks or our food she was eating something. Also we saw her pick up the dirty rugs and return to tables without washing her hands to protect her customers from the disgusting things that have been dropped and walked on. Also coming outside the front of the establishment to make out with a patron doesn&#39;t look very good.

The drinks are cheap, which is great, but if you&#39;re a cocktail snob like me, I would advise you stick to beer. I&#39;ve gotten a couple of incorrectly made mixed drinks here, but again, I can&#39;t complain for the price. 

I will say, I love the booths in the wall (which are a great place to hide from people you went to high school with) but it&#39;s still sometimes too loud in here to even hear the person next to you.

The biggest blow: $1 burgers. Granted, I know it&#39;s only a buck. But that&#39;s because they taste like Burger King Whoppers. The add ons are expensive and they didn&#39;t manage to get them right.

My biggest pet peeve is when a restaurant asks me &#34;how do you want your burger cooked?&#34; And then cooks allllll of them well done. The burgers are so thin, why on earth are you asking me that. bulldogs is setting themselves up for disappointment."

She can back after 15 minutes and asked if we wanted anything else. We order our entrees and soon after our app came out. Only one app came out so we though the other would be right behind it.  After 25 minutes our food came out and I reminded kailey our waitress about the other app and how it never came out and she said &#34;oh I forgot to put it in, so you still want it?&#34; Our course with the entrees out we didn&#39;t want it anymore. She never brought any ketchup or asked the new member of our party if he wanted anything to drink. She just kelp walking straight past us and to the kitchen. It took 15 for her to even stop by us only because we asked another waitress to get her. Our new member of the party got his drink finally and I asked for water. I had to ask 4 times for a water because she kept forgetting. Will never come back if she is my server"

My sister just moved to Roselle so I met her here for lunch to help her check out her new hood. Such a great spot in town to grab a drink or meal.

At first I was a little taken back, because we sat there for a few minutes with nobody to greet us. This was confusing because there were plenty of people working and a decent amount of people in the bar. Finally someone approached us and apologized that we hadn&#39;t been helped yet. 

All was forgiven when I was told the Thursday specials....wait for it....$2 DRAFTS. ANY DRAFT! I&#39;ve heard of your classic $2 domestic deals and what not, but any beer on tap? This. is. fantastic. They have over 70 beers on tap! It&#39;s insane. Insanely awesome that is. I went with a Solemn Oath Snaggletooth Bandana pint. I was so excited about this that I nearly missed what the food special was - 89 cent chicken fingers, what whaaat! 

Now that I&#39;m all worked up before even opening the menu, I decided it was time to peruse. I initial was going to just go with the chicken fingers and have the cheapest tab ever, but everything on there menu sounded delishhhh. Plus, the menu is huge! Appetizers, sandwiches, salad, wraps, pizza, flatbreads, entrees - you name it.

I went with the Spicy Garlic Chicken Wrap because it was labeled as a fan favorite in the menu. This grilled chicken breast is dipped in Bulldog spicy garlic sauce, tossed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and shredded cheese wrapped in a whole wheat wrap and served with cool ranch sauce. Um...yeah. I think that speaks for itself. I had my choice of either coleslaw or fries as my side and of course I went with the fries. 

The venue itself is a great space! Huge center bar, tons of high top tables, big booths, TVs and they even have a pool table and slot machines in the back!

Somethin&#39; Extra: Whatever you order, get a side of ranch with it. This should go without saying as a tip for life in general, however Bulldog&#39;s ranch is OUT OF THIS WORLD. 

Pro tip: The bar was pretty busy at about 2 PM on a Thursday, and it was a ration of about 99% men to 1% women. My sister and I were definitely the minority. Like, we&#39;re talkin some dude whistling when we walked by (who does that?! Thanks but no thanks.). So put that in your back pocket..."

We had to wait 10 minutes before the waitress came..Then we had to ask for menus since it was seated yourself. Waited again to place our drink order. There was 4 if us. 3 ordered the burger special and 1 ordered a salad. Had to flag down the waitress because there was no dressing for the salad. We notice about 3 managers just seated at a high top table talking. As management you should be more aware of what&#39;s going on. It seemed like there was only 1 waitress , 1 bartender and food runner working. There is no excuse for bad service."

The patty melt was great and I love that it came with thousand island dressing! The Curley, waffle and regular fries rock. The beer selection is phenomenal. 

Tuesday is all you can eat wings. The bone-in are some of the best wings I&#39;ve had. The boneless though are not good. No Bueno. But both are all you can eat! You start out with 10 and can order an additional 5 after that. But you can&#39;t place an order for more until you are done with your first 10. 

Wednesday is 1/2 off pizza. Pizza looked great and the guy who ate it (not me) said it was great but the crust was a tad undercooked. 

The only bad thing about this location... Is they TAKE FOREVER. We have been to this place all days of the week and every time it takes forever. We are only suppose to have an hour lunch including drive time but it always ends up taking 1 to 1 1/2 hours during lunch just in the restaurant! Not including drive time! We can no longer go here for lunch sadly. I hope they can fix this but we&#39;ve been there over 5 times and it&#39;s always been like this :/"

They have lots of specials, some of which aren&#39;t that obvious - our group ordered 2 of the $5.99 lunch items without knowing they were specials.  The chicken wraps are first rate, and the salads are amazing for a place such as this, which doesn&#39;t seem like the locale for a salad eater to seek out. Beer for $2 on Thursdays is a real deal, as there are over 50 to choose from.  Our server this past Thursday was especially good to us, as we spent about 4 hours hanging around."

The inside is very nice.  Tons of TVs and small ones inside the booths.  There is a second floor for seating and they also have an area for pool.  There is outdoor seating too for those wonderful lunches or beautiful summer night dinners.

The waitstaff was incredible.  I was greeted immediately and taken to our booth.  I felt our waitress read us perfectly.  She knew when we were ready and stopped by just enough so we felt they cared and not enough to where we were annoyed.  The manager or owner I believe even stopped by and asked how we were.  Supurb service! *Keep in mind this was Sunday during lunch. It wasn&#39;t super crowded so I can&#39;t speak to service on a busy night.

On to the food.  We started with their pretzels, which are a great price for how much you get.  Only bad part is the pretzels were definitely frozen and not fresh made as well as the cheese sauce. Also had cheesequesadilla which the cheese wasn&#39;t melted.  SKIP THE APPS. NOT GOOD

I was with my fiance and we ordered two different things.  She got the el camino wrap, a local favorite, and asked if the chef could make it vegetarian which he did and she like though they just added extra lettuce. I got a new menu item, the Po Boy sandwhich.  The shrimp were very fresh and fried with beer batter perfectly.  The chipotle sauce on it is amazing.  I also got the spicy farlic chicke wrap. It lacked veggies as you can see in the photo its small.

Lastly  they had exellent specials when i went and also throughout the week.  I got a 2 different 16oz. 312&#39;s for $3 apiece.

Definitely will be heading back but not ordering apps."

Huge beer selection that changes often; food is pretty decent. They used to have delicious spinach artichoke dip but have since adjusted their menu. We love the wings and the Garlic Parmesan tots especially, but most things are great on their menu!

It&#39;s an upscale version of the dive bar you made your home in college. An adult hangout spot to watch the game with friends or go to for a late-night bite. They have awesome daily specials. 

Be aware that Thursdays include $2 any draft, so it gets busy in the evening. Good service can be spotty on busier nights, but we&#39;ve never had a problem. Busy on nights The Blackhawks play but it&#39;s SO MUCH FUN to watch the games there.

Phone-in orders have to be double-checked but they always fix any issue we may have. Very friendly employees.

We are mostly seniors and had to have accessible seating.  That made the entire upstairs and most of the main floor off limits because of the tall bar stools.  And no booth seats 10, so we settled for two booths with an aisle in between. 

The booths are roomy and I found them quite comfortable.  It&#39;s nearly impossible to have a conversation among 10 people anyway, so I was very satisfied with the arrangement. 

The menu was a pleasant surprise.  As an Ale house I was expecting maybe burgers, fish &amp; chips and possibly ready made pizza.  But the menu offered a good variety of sandwiches, some pasta and salads and a pot roast meal that many of our group ordered.  Those who had that dish raved about it! 

Personally, I had the Deluxe Pizza, first because I love pizza, second because that was what I had been expecting and lastly because Wednesday is half price pizza day.  You do have to order a drink with the pizza, but it turns out that Wednesday is also $3 drink day.  So I had one of the many beer offerings with my meal. 

I found the pizza to be really good.  Certainly not the best pizza in the area, but a cut above the AVERAGE pizza. My drink was the Bulldog Amber Ale. That was a bit sweeter than I like, but I was just experimenting and have no reason to complain. 

One thing I really liked about this place as a lunch location is that it was quiet enough that our group didn&#39;t have to shout to hold a conversation. So many places crank the TVs or music so loud that this is impossible.  If that was done especially for our older group then Thank You!  If this is normal for lunch time then simply keep up the good work. 

I have never been here for dinner or an evening watching sports. I&#39;m guessing the place is much louder then.  If that&#39;s OK with you then I encourage you to give Bulldog Ale House a try.  Heck, you probably pass it when you leave the Roselle Metra station anyway."

Especially on Thirsty Thursday for whatever beer special they have!

I&#39;m a sucker for boneless buffalo wings, so they get a star for having those that are decent and edible food otherwise. In general, for most menu items.... overpriced for junk food. Good quality for a sports bar, maybe?

I&#39;m not a sports fan, I don&#39;t like sports fans, and I think sports and their fans are of a lower class citizenship. So maybe I&#39;m just biased on their targeted demographic.

Oh, and what the hell is up with these mouth-breathers bringing their offspring into a restaurant with toned down Hooters waitresses / bartenders?

Don&#39;t go on Thursdays, it&#39;s just way too packed, and you don&#39;t want to be one of those mainstream, sheeple types do you? Monday has dirt cheap burgers that taste OK. All of their specials are dine-in only and you&#39;re usually required to buy a beer."

The nice thing about it is that they have a kitchen that&#39;s open relatively late compared to other restaurants in the area, so they&#39;ve been a much better option than fast food after coming from evening concerts or late night return flights.

Dalibor Z. recommends the burgers and boneless wings. I almost always get the entrée size Mac &amp; Cheese with added grilled chicken and bacon. It&#39;s by no means gourmet. They&#39;ve got a questionably bright yellow and smooth sauce, but it&#39;s a dependable dinner option when I&#39;m not too concerned with calories.

They have a solid and lengthy beer list. My only piece of advice for the taps and bottles, which take up a few laminated pages, would be to have a separate area for the hard ciders. If I can rely on my memory, drafts are listed first and then bottles. In each section, I think, they are sorted alphabetically. It&#39;s very helpful, but I find myself having to go through the entire list to check for ciders hidden among the beer before I can find what I want.

The other area where Bulldog falls short is cleanliness. A few times we&#39;ve been seated at sticky tables and the last time we visited it was pretty obvious our booth hadn&#39;t been cleaned properly, if at all. There was a half eaten chicken wing on one cushion and sauce, crumbs, and other liquids scattered across the table top. It was pretty gross. If the area open to the public is left such a mess, it makes you wonder what&#39;s going on behind closed doors. With that being said, more often than not, we&#39;ve had very few issues.

Be sure to bring your Driver&#39;s License or State ID Card, even if you aren&#39;t drinking boozy drinks. They often check IDs at the door and you&#39;ll be SOL if you don&#39;t have it on hand."

Those were devoured in minutes of arrival and thoroughly enjoyed!   We also selected the Caprese Flatbread.  While the flatbread was good, the toppings were sparse - I will be venturing to try other &#34;main courses&#34; but of course with a side of Truffle Fries.

We went as a family of five on a burger special night...yea we knew we were going to pay extra for fries etc...and that was ok.  We put our three sons orders in first...all three were double with bacon and american cheese, two hold the garden.  We ordered two soups and two fries, three root beers.

Soup was Broccoli and Cheddar and was very good, the fries were average, the burgers came very quickly...we got two doubles, one of them was supposed to have the garden, it did not and the last double was demoted to a single....everything went back.  We informed our server, when the burgers came back...they were charred AFTER we had ordered medium....the boys were hungry and devoured them regardless..   My wife and I ordered, I had the cajun chicken pasta, this was done correctly, my wife ordered a double with the garden plus american cheese and bacon.  You aren&#39;t going to believe it but NO bacon...this went back...came back with the bacon but again medium transformed into charred.

I left a smaller tip then I would normally BUT told Callie why and my wife spoke to the manager...we never asked or were offered anything and that&#39;s ok because...we won&#39;t be coming back.

My extended family of 8 adults and 2 children showed up right as they opened, just before the Bears/Packers game.  Our large party had to be seated in the back corner of the balcony, which was fine by us because it kept us away from the rest of the customers who were there for the game, and was noticeably quieter (apart from the cheering), which in my book was a good thing.  My main fear of being placed so far away from everyone else is that the service would suffer, but I was happy to note that not only did our waitress make regular trips up the stairs to check on us, but another employee did stop by more than once to grab empty plates.

The food here is great as usual. The 39 cent wings (Sunday special), pretzel appetizers, and chips were all very tasty. Most of us ordered burgers which were all raved about, though I preferred the standard bacon burger to the breakfast burger I got this time. The alfredo pasta and flatbreads pleased those who ordered them as well.

Very glad to have found this place. I have only one complaint, and that is that their web site offers a &#34;free entree&#34; coupon when another entree and two drinks are purchased, but this coupon has a limit of $7 and there are no $7 entrees, so there can be no &#34;free entree,&#34; just a discounted one. Still a pretty good deal I won&#39;t hesitate to use, but the misleading wording puts me off a bit.  Luckily the food is good enough that I will definitely be returning."

I live in Chicago so im sure I won&#39;t be here very often. A group of about 10 coworkers went there for happy hour last Thursday for the $2 craft beer special.  We sat on the 2nd floor so it was nice that we had a lot of room to move around and it wasnt super loud like downstairs. 

We ordered many appetizers and everyone seemed to enjoy them. The soft pretzels with the spicy queso were my fav! It was also funny that we would order a food item and like 5 mins later it was there!! The service was faster than Jimmy Johns... not even kidding!! 

Their beer selection is also insane so its hard to pick something (I had to flip through their beer binder a few times to make a selection). Many choices to pick from and they were only $2 on Thursday. 

My only complaint was the long walk to the bathroom... we had to walk around the entire bar to get to the restroom."

I&#39;m only giving 4 stars 1.) Because I don&#39;t want yelp to filter it if I give 5 stars as they sometimes do and 2.) Because it did take a bit for a server to come to our table at first but it was really busy on a Saturday so I can&#39;t be understanding there.. 

We&#39;ve only been here twice so far, it&#39;s only a couple miles from home tho and we plan to become more of regulars. 

The food has not let us down so far at all! I was truly shocked at the quality of the food being this is a sports bar - let&#39;s be honest, bar food isn&#39;t exactly always the greatest. The first visit I had the mac n cheese burger. It was delicious! Only thing that sucks with those specialty burgers is that they&#39;re ridiculously thick and difficult to eat but we make it through right?! Lol The truffle fries were really good. Maybe not the BEST I&#39;ve had but great flavor and didn&#39;t skimp on the truffle oil. Could have used a little more of the dipping sauce tho cuz we&#39;re hearty dippers. My drink was the horchata martini... let me tell you I was so excited to try this! It was really good (bartender - please do your cinnamon rim a little better tho cuz it was lacking) 

Second trip had the nachos with chicken. (Not the waffle nachos - those we&#39;re trying next time) These were surprisingly fresh and filling. The chips seemed homemade and we&#39;re really good. They&#39;re not stacked so it doesn&#39;t end up mushy by the end which is nice. We also ordered the jalapeño poppers. WOW! These were so GOOD! They&#39;re not fried which was great. They don&#39;t completely gut the jalapeño either so they retain their spiciness better than regular jalapeño poppers. Accompanied by a Chipotle ranch was a nice touch. If you like spicy foods (don&#39;t worry they&#39;re not TOO spicy) I definitely recommend trying these out! 

The atmosphere was really great. The manager checked on us TWICE to ensure we were enjoying ourselves and they had Michael Jackson and some older dance music playing. In all was a great time!  They have an email club that I receive coupons for too which makes it easy on the ol&#39; pockets. Can&#39;t wait to go back. Happy we finally popped in!"

I wanted to add my take on the $1 Monday burger special. First of all, I&#39;d guess it&#39;s a third pound of fresh (not frozen) beef. Their regular menu says half pound for the regular price; this patty could have easily been 1/2 lb before cooking. My burger was fairly lean and cooked to my order.

Unlike some other bars with burger specials, onion, lettuce, pickle, and tomato are included in the $1 price. Cheese is a mere 50 cents extra and you can choose from 4 cheeses including pepper jack; bacon is extra also but I didn&#39;t write down how much extra. Add a second or third beef patty to make a mountain of a sandwich for an additional dollar for each patty.

Fries are not included and they have 4 different types including plain, seasoned, waffle and tater tots. Half orders are available for $2.99. The fries we were served looked different than the ones in the photo uploaded by another reviewer. I ordered tots and felt they were tasty and enjoyable.

You do have to order a drink to get the special price and it is dine in only; but seriously- who would have a burger without at least a soft drink?

No one in our party ordered wings, but I noted that there are 10 different side sauces available. You can also get a side sauce if you order boneless chicken tenders. Tuesday is all you can eat wing night for $10.99.

Bulldog has 6 $5 lunch specials from 11am to 2 pm also. Some of the women in the group ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with fries and thought it was tasty for the price. As with the burger you must purchase a drink with the sandwich and it is dine in only.

I felt the service was good to very good- examples being changing the games on the TV&#39;s with no hassle and separate checks for the people in our large group without having to ask.

There is a selection of over 70 beers on tap including a few hard to find craft beers (ask for the beer menu or look on line). Every beer we ordered was available and served quickly.

Overall I felt that this is a good sports bar for lunch or the big game. A tip is that if there is no parking available in the main lot, there is an auxiliary parking lot a short walk across the side street that few people know about."

I usually go for dinner which I&#39;ve never had any issues with the service. Today my 5 year old son and I went for a late lunch around 3 pm. There were a couple things I was not happy with. First thing is having to ask for drink refills for my son even after she dropped off our food at our table. Usually I would think a server would automatically refill drinks when they are empty. She never asked if we wanted any water. I also explained to her I have the coupon for $10 off $30. She said she would check on how much I was up to. She ended up bringing the check without even checking or asking for the coupon. The bill was around $25.00 so if I would have known I would have order maybe some soup or salad. Another issue I had was no napkins. With a kid we all know how many napkins we need which she never brought. I ended up just paying the bill so that I could get out of there. It&#39;s really a shame because my son loves eating here. Maybe she was more worried about customers who are drinking for larger tips. Will only be back at night for better staff.

The bartenders look like they just rolled out of bed to get their.  I&#39;m young as well and know the bar business and have always looked presentable. They don&#39;t say hello, they say :what do you need?&#34;  I need to have polite, fast, effiecient service is what I need.

As for the food, my 2 friends and I agreed this place is not worth the money.  Soggy pizza, over cooked pasta and don&#39;t even get me started on the boneless wings.  So not edible and my friend took them back.

The food is mediocre,  never great; but it&#39;s not expensive either. Their coleslaw is the absolute worst I&#39;ve had on recent memory. 

What bothers me most about Bulldogs is the service. I&#39;ve been to Bulldogs a total of five times on different days of the week and at different times during the day. Every time I&#39;ve been here the service have been ridiculously slow. The food is slow, the bartenders pour slow, the waitresses are slow. Even when the place is empty the staff is slow on purpose. I&#39;ve sat at the bar and waited 5 minutes to have my order taken on multiple occasions because a failed actress had to tell her Instagram friends that she was slicing the lemons. 

This place is decent if you&#39;re drunk because you usually won&#39;t notice the slow service. I recommend making the drive to Schaumburg to find a decent brew house instead of Bulldogs."

I was lured here by the $1 burgers other Yelpers mentioned. It was a bit awkward at 1130 with just a couple of people at the bar and this place is HUGE. It&#39;s actually quite nice with nice booths. I wish it were closer to my work as then I could see it becoming a lunch hot spot.

The ladies here wear little plaid skirts which is something fellas can admire. 

The $1 burger is definitely $1 but you have to buy a drink with it and cheese is 50 cents extra. Pop is $2.50 so not bad at all to get the whole meal for $4. No fries though, so if you want those you have to order them on the side. I would recommend skipping the fries as they seem like they are the frozen kind. The burger was really good, greasy and tasty, but not the best I&#39;ve ever had.

All in all, if you&#39;re in the area, pop in and be sure to hit up there $1 burger night. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way for the trip here though!"

There&#39;s a tall guy that I believe is the manager. We&#39;ve had a few interactions with him and he&#39;s a pretty cool and very nice. The servers and bartenders should follow his lead.

The hostess wasn&#39;t overly friendly or anything - in fact, it seemed like she was busy with other tasks.  She seated us at a giant booth in the bar area, and our server soon came over. We were a little torn on appetizers, so asked for her suggestion.  She suggested the Truffle Fries, so that&#39;s what we got!  Admittedly it took us a while to decide what to get from their extensive menu, but we decided on the Earth Burger (me) and the Bang Bang Shrimp Wrap(him).  She asked if we wanted our app to come out before the entrees (yes please!).

The fries were pretty good - waffle fries with truffle oil, and a mayo-type dipping sauce.  I wasn&#39;t SUPER crazy about the sauce (I&#39;m not a big mayo eater), but it ended up growing on me by the end when I found myself dipping my OTHER fries into it.  Oops.

Our entrees came out shortly after the Truffle Fries app, but at least we had a huge space with which to put our plates.  My Earth Burger (grilled marinated portabella mushroom with mozzarella cheese and roasted red peppers) initially seemed OK, but going into the second bite, it was clear what a wet sloppy mess the whole thing was.  The &#34;roasted red pepper&#34; was of the marinated + canned variety (very wet).  The lettuce that was on there was also saturated with some type of sauce/condiment.   The mushroom slid out of the burger, and I then attempted to eat the whole dilly with a knife and fork.  When I got a bite of the mushroom alone, I was really put off by how saturated it was in a vinegar-type marinade.  To be sure, I asked my +1 to try it, and he made the same comment.  It was really disappointing, and while I&#39;m definitely one to either clean my plate or take home leftovers, I definitely passed on both accounts.

I had a bite of my +1&#39;s Bang Bang Shrimp Wrap.  We didn&#39;t find a whole lot of shrimp inside.  Still, it seemed better than my burger, yet also wet. I&#39;m not sure how it kept for lunch the next day.

In all, I wonder if I ordered the wrong thing, as the portabella burger - while good in concept - just seemed poorly executed.  I think it would be less sloppy with more simple ingredients (maybe unmarinated portabella and grilled red pepper).  Still, there are a lot of fish/veggie options, so that&#39;s an obvious plus.

In all, Bulldog seemed like a really nice casual place to have a lunch or dinner, and I&#39;d head back if my +1 wanted to give it another shot."

I&#39;d heard about their ridiculous selection of craft beers on tap, and of course got excited. (At last count, the Roselle location has 72. WHAT?!?!) But then I&#39;d read about how they&#39;re often out of beer, which dulled my excitement somewhat. 

I was really craving a burger that I could have cooked to my specification of doneness, as well as onion rings. That&#39;s a harder combo to come by these days then you might think. Since it&#39;s so close by, and since I didn&#39;t want to spend a ton of time (important owl ish to do, you know), I decided to chance a lunch at the Bulldog.

I got there pretty early, around 11:30 or so -- before the real lunch rush started to hit. I was immediately seated by the host, who gave me my choice of a booth or table since a) the place is HUGE, and b) the place was super empty at this point. I took a booth. Good choice. 

A server immediately came over to see if I wanted anything to drink. I hadn&#39;t yet had a chance to glance at their drinks menu, but she helpfully pulled out the current one. When I asked what Revolution Brewing&#39;s Cross of Gold was like, she said she didn&#39;t know. She&#39;d had other Revolution brews and liked them (as have I), but she immediately offered to get me a sample. A minute or so later, she reappeared with a sample of a perfectly light, seasonal golden ale -- which I promptly ordered. We chatted a bit about some other Revolution beers (including Rosa, which I&#39;d only tried in a can and found a bit disappointing, but had heard was better on draft), and I placed my food order.

It was a Monday, and therefore the day that Bulldog offers its burger specials. Quarter-pound burgers are $1-$3, depending on whether you want 1-3 quarter-pound patties of meat on your burger. You don&#39;t get to specify how they&#39;re cooked, and additional toppings (cheese, etc.) are extra. I wanted a med-rare burger with onion rings. I went with the Ale House Burger instead. 

It was cooked perfectly, just as I&#39;d ordered it. Pretzel bun. Delicious BBQ sauce. Tasty bacon and cheddar. And the onion rings? The onion rings were perfect, too. The deep-fryer oil was clearly changed recently, and they were cooked at the correct temperature for the correct amount of time. They were perfectly golden brown and delicious -- and not greasy. Praise be; perfectly drained, crispy, delicious onion rings! Also, there were the perfect amount for a side. 

My server also brought me a sample of Revolution&#39;s Rosa hibiscus ale as well, since they had it on draft and since we&#39;d talked about it. I didn&#39;t even have to ask. (It&#39;s better on draft, but still not something I&#39;d order in full pint-size. Now I know, and as G.I. Joe taught us, knowing is half the battle!) 

As the dining room got more crowded, service did get slower. There were a few other servers circulating, but like lunch rushes do, everyone converged on Bulldog&#39;s dining area at once. It took forever for me to get my check, get a box for the other half of my burger, pay, and leave. (It probably took longer waiting for all that than it did for me to place my order, receive, and eat my food. I like not being rushed, but still.) Service was really nice, and the server did apologize for my having to wait so long to get my check. 

My general impression: decent place, as long as you&#39;re not in a hurry. And try to avoid peak rushes for best service. Also, the other reviews that have mentioned disappointment in $1-$3 burgers? Uh, seriously, if you&#39;re paying $1 for a burger and expecting something much beyond what you&#39;d get on the Value Menu at any fast food establishment, I think it&#39;s a little unrealistic. While loss leaders are designed to get your butt in the door, there&#39;s only so much &#34;loss&#34; that a business is going to want to take. Want a better burger? Spend more than a dollar on it.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Florentine: The ingredients were fresh, and the soft, thick crust reminded me of the fabulous focaccia breads from Elena&#39;s.

Sadly the fries were terrible--over-baked, barely worth eating. (Reading the other reviews, it seems we have a Yelp consensus: Don&#39;t get the fries! It&#39;s possible the potato wedges are better, though.) The cheese sauce I ordered had an nice pepper jack flavor, but it was lumpy and thin.

Our server, Samantha, was outstanding! Super friendly attitude, and she checked on us many times throughout the evening.

The hostess was great too. I appreciated that when we requested a table outside, she informed us there was smoking going on in case we wanted to avoid it.

The atmosphere was loud--we really had to lean in to hear each other. Relatedly, it was karaoke night, which was very painful at times :). Whoever was singing Sinatra did great though. The table surface was made of some kind of nasty soft material that kept getting in my fingernails... but overall, it was a good time. We&#39;ll be back so my partner can try the $1 burgers."

The beer selection is very good, no matter what your preference, you should find something you like. The beer came out a little warm and I wasn&#39;t able to get a refill as quickly has I would have wanted, but our server was very nice.
The atmosphere was nice and the music volume was just right. You could hear it, but you could also hear the person next to you.

Service has always been decent and the servers/managers personable and engaging. Last night we went for the AYCE wings. $10.99 for either traditional or boneless and you can change back and forth. The 1st order gets you 10 wings and you can get 2 sauces (5 wings in each sauce). Refills are 5 wings in 1 sauce.

Our server (Elizabeth R) was very nice and helpful. Having only been there a short time, anything she wasn&#39;t sure of she quickly went and found out. And the manager (Joe) stopped by several times to make sure everything was ok and see if there was anything he could do to improve our visit.

They have different food and drink specials every day of the week, so there&#39;s something for everyone. Tuesdays are $3 any drink, beer or shot and the aforementioned wing special."

I actually really like their food and was recently introduced to their wings.....that sauce on wings is addicting and delicious! I wish they gave you more. 

The place is huge, bar is in the middle, pool table off to the side with their video gaming and bathrooms. The parking is not bad, but you will drive around the back of the building if there is nothing in front. I&#39;ve never really had a problem with it though as people are often coming and going.

The lack of star was because our check took forever to get. That&#39;s a pet peeve of mine, if we tell you we are good for the night......bring us a check because that means we want to leave. I don&#39;t need 20 minutes to sit and think about if I really want to go.

I read the reviews before going and noticed a couple people had issues with appetizers arriving too close to the main course. Well ours didn&#39;t arrive at all. Then when our food arrived the server had a perplexed look on her face as she saw we didn&#39;t get the pretzels we ordered. Upon going back to the kitchen she discovered they lost the ticket and then they brought out the pretzels. She instantly said she would have a manager come over and talk to us. It was nice that she was so pro-active on the situation. The manger was quite pleasant and took the pretzels off our tab. 
To sum it up - staff was attentive and resolved the issue quickly which was very nice to see. Food is your average to slightly above average bar food. This is a good place to go to watch TV sports and kick back after a work week."

Normally great beer, mediocre food (small side portions) and decent service if not too busy. I recently went there after not going for 3 months and it was not great. The servers seemed new and had no clue about anything. They said they were out of beers they had. A new server took over and I got a beer that the previous said was out. Suggestion for the craft beer loving people is to update that list daily on beermenus or tap finder would be great. So place closed at one and we go to settle our tab at 12. I only had credit card as I leave debit at home. The cc machine was apparently down. Server apologized, I tried to get cash from my cc but couldn&#39;t. Manager comes over and harassed us from the start. He said what&#39;s wrong here like we did something wrong. He was a bald headed male. He asked why we couldn&#39;t get cash from atm and settle the tab. i proceeded to explain we are trying to but your credit system is down.. He became angry and was accusing. Now I have paid every tab since coming to this facility and planned out it from the start. He continued to harass the three of us for our tab. We had no clue why the manager was so angry at something we could not do anything about. We had credit cards out and everything. I guess I&#39;ll bring 10 forms of payment next time so I don&#39;t get harassed like a criminal."

I&#39;d been here once before (briefly) and was impressed with the neighborly, mellow sports crowd. So, we all came here for some bites &amp; drinks and it happened to be $3 you call it. Sweet. The place is HUGE with upstairs seating and a little spot outdoors too. It was also crowded. Regardless of the crowd, there was one table left for all of us to sit at - we all squished into a booth facing a few televisions. 

A young blonde woman was our waitress. She walked by our table several times before she even gave us attention. The boys at the table next to us were more interesting, I guess. We finally ordered after ten minutes. I originally wanted a martini but that wasn&#39;t part of the special, so I ordered a pineapple upside down cake. My pineapple upside down cake was terrible. It wasn&#39;t pineapple-y at all -- but very cherry. I couldn&#39;t drink it. The waitress didn&#39;t even offer to get me another one. She just said, &#34;Well that&#39;s how the bartender makes it.&#34; I don&#39;t care how the bartender makes it -- it&#39;s my drink and she needs to make it right! I sent it back and ordered a beer instead (the beer was fine). On another note: my friend&#39;s Long Island was really small, too. Strike one.

We ordered a little food. My fries were OK. My friends&#39; salads were a good size. My husband&#39;s meal was ridiculous. He ordered five wings for $4. They were five measly wings. On a tiny plate. For $4. We were all in shock at how small his plate was. Finally, he was forced to &#39;upgrade&#39; to the special -- all you can eat wings for $10.99. Strike two.

Our waitress couldn&#39;t remember who ordered what. Our dishes kept getting served to the wrong people and at the end of the evening, she came back to ask us who had ordered what. I don&#39;t understand why she didn&#39;t write this all down (or at least have some kind of order). We left feeling slightly frustrated and neglected. Strike three.

The only saving grace was the really tall, thin guy with glasses that kept checking on our table and respecting our requests for TV channels and closed captioning. I hope the rest of Bulldog staff are like this guy. The blonde waitress we had just didn&#39;t cut it.

Despite our not-so-great experience, I&#39;d rather come here than Buffalo Wild Wings or any other typical chain sports bar. If you want to watch the game in a packed bar and sip on some mediocre drinks while taking advantage of daily specials, then this is a good spot to be. But if you want real drinks, good service, and a calmer environment, you&#39;re better off somewhere else."

Stopped in on Friday 10/21/2016. at 2:30pm. Women taking my carryout order was very friendly. She told me the order would take 18 minutes. I ordered the 30 pack of bone in wings. 10 with Louisiana Rub, 10 with Original Hot and 10 with Teriyaki, blue cheese dip  and a side order of coleslaw.

The wings were a bit overcooked, but I&#39;d rather have them overcooked than under cooked. All three wing flavors were delicious. The Louisiana Rub was actually hotter than the Original Hot. The blue cheese dip was homemade and had a lot of garlic, which liked. The coleslaw was real fresh, and the hand-cut fries were delicious.

I ordered online. For some reason my order was messed up and instead of 10 hot/10 garlic parm, we got those flavors and teriyaki. When I told the cashier I hadn&#39;t ordered teriyaki, she said it would take 19 mins to make a new batch. How is that even possible?

The wings were terrible. Instead of well done like we asked, they weren&#39;t. The flavors were bland. The garlic parm is just Kraft cheese sprinkled over a plain wing.

Maybe that&#39;s because while I like getting my hands dirty while making food, I don&#39;t like getting my hands dirty while eating it. (I know, I&#39;m a total weirdo. Also why I don&#39;t like ribs.) 

Anyway, I have a burn on one of my fingers, so I slid a rubber glove on before diving into the wings we got from Wing Stop last night. What a difference a glove makes! I&#39;d probably eat a lot more wings if I always carried a spare glove on me, lol! 

Here&#39;s something else I didn&#39;t know about wings: both Wing Stop and competitor BDubs have gluten free wings! Most (not all, so check carefully if you or a loved one is GF) of the bone-in wings here are GF. Brilliant. So GF people can get their chicken on without worry, just like anyone else. 

Fries are also good. Love the hickory BBQ sauce, am not that keen on the lemon pepper, and think the garlic parmesan is aaaaiiiight. Really like that the dipping sauces we ordered (ranch, honey mustard, and blue cheese) seem to not just be the standard-issue Kraft-for-foodservice jugs. They&#39;re nice. Like that.

We ordered online, and I didn&#39;t notice that they apparently are famous for their bourbon baked beans as well...or I&#39;d have ordered some. Next time. For some reason, I have a hella huge craving for baked beans lately, and I have no idea why. (Should really just make up a big pot and nom on them for a week.) 

Definitely want to try the mango habanero next time. Only I know I&#39;ll be the only one in the house eating them, because I&#39;m the only one who eats spicy. Bring it."

I&#39;m also a big fan of their Parmesan garlic.  It can be a bit greasy, but it is so worth it.  I&#39;ve tried all the other flavors.  Their Buffalo is ok, not blow your socks off.  Same with their BBQ.  It&#39;s ok.  Not great.

Lemon Pepper and Parm Garlic is all I mess with here.  Don&#39;t sleep on their boneless (basically chicken tenders).  Only if it&#39;s LP and PG for me though...

I ordered a boneless combo with two flavors. &#34;I&#39;ll have... Hot and Atomic.&#34; The guy behind the counter mumbled something I couldn&#39;t understand, so I continued ordering. &#34;HAVE YOU HAD THE ATOMIC SAUCE BEFORE?&#34; he screamed at me. I told D-Bag that I haven&#39;t had Atomic before and he brought me a little cup to try. I took a lick and it tasted good and definitely tolerable heat-wise, so I said &#34;Yeah, that&#39;s fine.&#34; FYI, this was my first time at a Wingstop as you&#39;ll usually find me at Buffalo Wild Wings. Wingstop&#39;s Atomic is definitely less hot than Blazin&#39;. In case you were wondering. Anyways, D-Bag then gave me the worst glare EVER. I looked at him the exact same way and we did this for about 5 seconds (pretty long, in glaring time). &#34;Is that a problem? I like hot food,&#34; I said. &#34;No,&#34; he said and rolled his eyes. So be warned: the guy with blonde curly hair and earrings at Wingstop on Lake hates his life.

I just don&#39;t understand why he would have a negative reaction to me ordering Atomic. Yes, it&#39;s the hottest sauce on their menu and I Am A Boss. But seriously, I&#39;m not trying to brag and I wasn&#39;t trying to show off for anyone-- I just &#34;like hot food,&#34; as I told him, and that shouldn&#39;t be a problem. 

The wings were okay. My guy friend likes them better than BWW&#39;s Boneless because they have less breading and don&#39;t skimp on the sauce. But BWW&#39;s sauces are just better, sorry. My Hot wings were so bad they were inedible, and by the fourth Atomic wing my mouth realized they were way too sour for my tastes. The fries and cheese sauce, however, were a major step above B-Dubs&#39;.

No joke, it&#39;s insanely good.  

So far I&#39;ve tried the teriyaki, Hawaiian, and BBQ wings.  So far my favorite is the BBQ.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the teriyaki wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t my personal favorite.  I honestly just love a good BBQ wing.  One of these days I&#39;ll get around to trying their hot wings, but I have to work up the courage to do so and I&#39;m really not that brave when I&#39;m flying solo.  

Also, I don&#39;t know what anyone else thinks but the fries might be laced with an addictive substance.  They are *that* good!"

They have a nice variety of flavors as well as several forms of wings, from traditional to boneless to strips. Their wings aren&#39;t overly sticky nor overly sauced, kinda the perfect combination of messy yet dry. On top of this they have this honey mustard that I&#39;m addicted to - I can&#39;t stop dipping the wings and fries in the stuff!

As for the sides, I can only really recommend the fries and cole slaw. The fries have a genius blend of salt, spices and sugar on em making them irresistible. I keep meaning to try and replicate the coating at home but fuck it, I&#39;ll just order Wingstop. Their cole slaw is nothing to write home about, let&#39;s just compare it to KFC&#39;s and be done with it. Their &#34;famous&#34; baked beans are kinda sour, there&#39;s something off about them. Skip em, order extra fries.

Cost-wise they&#39;re a bit expensive but I feel they&#39;re worth it. The only real downside to Wingstop, the thing to take a star off, is their lack of delivery. With their prices not exactly bargain basement, you&#39;d think they could hire a delivery driver or three and save me the trip down Lake Street. But oh well, their wings kick ass so I can deal."

The atmosphere and interior is simple and quiet, which is definitely okay. It looks like a &#34;family-owned&#34; type of restaurant. The service was quick and the staff was very friendly. Our waitress kept refilling my coffee before I even needed to ask, which I appreciated.

I came in with a friend, he ordered your classic breakfast of two eggs (fried), two pieces of bacon, with extra crispy hashbrowns, and white toast. I ordered a spinach and feta Omlette with extra crispy hashbrowns and whole wheat toast.

The food was delicious. I should have just ordered the crispy (not extra) hashbrowns, I&#39;d recommend that!! The Omlette was amazing, a lot of spinach is in it and the feta cheese was great! I also enjoyed my toast (I used blackberry jam). 

They offer (already on the table): orange jam, blackberry jam, strawberry and grape jam.

Now with the condos on Dryden, it hard to see the restaurant, but don&#39;t forget that bad boy is there. Unlike most of the Greek owned and run dinners in Chicagoland, this one is also open for dinner and that is mighty fine with me.
Why is it good? The food is homemade. And it is like stepping outta 1968. They got the best fried chicken in the North Side, and it&#39;s made to order. Get really good fried fish, shrimp and scallop dinner. And this stuff is actually served with homemade soup,  and get this, a peach half outta the can!
The place is a big hit among the geriatric crowd, but that don&#39;t bother me. I love it for dinner, just take the family there. Daughter digs the spaghetti. 
And after all that..... you actually get some homemade Greek rice pudding with dessert if you get a dinner.

We each got the &#34;2 + 2&#34; : 2 eggs, 2 toast OR pancake, 4 sausage OR bacon, and hashbrown.

Yumsss. The cook was spot-on. Even the bacon wasn&#39;t abnormally fatty (though my +1 would disagree..), and you KNOW places can buy really cheap bacon. I do.

Our waitress and the bus boy guy were both friendly. The bus boy guy refilled our coffee cups TWICE after she kinda disappeared, so that was nice. (Thanks Guy!)

It is not a greek restaurant, it is greek owned and serves american food.  Recently they increase their prices again.  So now dinner specials for two people with tax and tip are close to $30.00.   However the quality of food has not improved.   You can rely on getting luke warm vegetables with your special.  The salad that comes with the special is really lettuce with a wedge of tomato.  Recently ordered bacon and eggs and the hash browns were cold and the scrambled eggs were what I consider rare.  Mind you the restaurant was not busy at the time so they really can not use the excuse that they were busy.  

Today I ordered one of their specials with a baked potato.  Hooray, that had not run out of baked potatoes today. The potato served was hot, but it was hard?  

They serve you rolls when you sit down.  They come in a basket with the crackers and bread sticks.  However the rolls are on top of the basket and not wrapped, so I always wonder how many people have fondled them before me.   I have seen some of them at times with what looks like thumb depressions in the rolls.  Yuck.

Truthfully ... food is just &#34;okay&#34; to &#34;good&#34; but they make up for it in service, which was friendly and prompt, and of course, their truly old fashioned ice cream parlor. I hope they never change that - love the vintage glass dishes and every treat topped off with a sugar wafer and a tiny umbrella.

The food is good enough to keep coming back, and the prices are ridiculously inexpensive. 

This will also always be the first place I ordered coffee (like an adult) and put enough cream and sugar in it to turn it into &#34;cream with coffee.&#34; And then, I didn&#39;t realize you had to pay for it (because I always saw my parents get it so I thought it was like asking for water. Oops).

True, it&#39;s not a &#34;Greek restaurant&#34; but I suppose it&#39;s what the Chicago suburbs call a &#34;Greek restaurant&#34; in that it&#39;s owned by Greeks, and you can get anything you want for a teeny bit of money.

Our waitress was very sweet and polite, but she was young and totally useless when we asked her repeatedly for her suggestions (&#34;Um... uh... they&#39;re all good...&#34;).  We had the omelet with Feta, grilled cheese sandwich, and a breakfast pastry.  They were brought out warm and relatively quickly, and Eros did not skimp on the cheese in the omlet which was good.  The very Greek-looking owner/manager/other was extremely friendly and outgoing as we paid and I think he&#39;s trying his best.

This is more of a Mel&#39;s diner than a greek restaurant. The food was just ok, we had a rueben and turkey melt. Honestly, we probably could have gotten better food and service next door at subway. The waitress was slow and rather cold, the only redeeming quality was the waiter who was helping her take care of tables. Not that the place had more than 3 tables seated at any given time but he was friendly and genuine unlike his female counterpart. One other thing that was a huge annoyance was the radio station they had playing was not coming in clearly so in addition to the mediocre food, and the icey waitress, static filled background noise was piped in the entire time."

Very good food...they make fresh, specially for vegitarian choice. Red salsa is really HOT...green is medium HOT...and they also have regular salsa too.

 The service was little slow but mostly because they need to make most of all our order from scratch as our most of the order was vegetarian. 

The guacamole was ok... Veggie fajita was good, as well as the burrito. Veggie casadia was nice, with cheese and green/red bell peppers. 

We see little difference, $1 or $2 more in price of couple of item in check compared to menu price (half guacamole was $5.99, but charged $7.99...and this price was not in menu at all for any size of guacamole...same for chicken fajitas, charged $1 more than menu price)..We really don&#39;t worry for this extra charge, and I understand they may be charge some extra for the salsa because we asked for so much salsa :)

Overall good experience..."

I&#39;m willing to update this review if there is an improvement. This place used to have good tacos, I was shocked at my recent take out order. I placed an order for 6 chicken tacos and 3 steak tacos to go. When I got home the chicken tacos stunk so badly, I open up the foil wrapping and the onions were smelling very bad, and in addition the chicken breast was heated chicken breast from a can. It wasn&#39;t their boiled chicken breast it was cubed perfectly and stringy just as canned chicken. It tasted like warmed can chicken, when you heat it it has a stink odor like a chicken coop.  The steak meat was very tough and not chewable. I was greatly disappointed. The food here has either changed or they ran out of food that day and gave me scraps, I don&#39;t know."

To start, make sure you order a margarita. Easily the best margaritas you&#39;ll find in this area. Chips &amp; Salsa is another customary item that will get you, and it is excellent. The food ranges, from carne asada, to chicken enchiladas (get the enchiladas!).

I also enjoyed the beans and rice that came with the dinner and I am not a fan of refried beans but these had a little heat to them. The location is great and the outdoor seating fun.

Sadly, it seems I have a bit of food poisoning from my second visit. I can safely tell you that because I didn&#39;t eat one single other thing the day of our recent visit, I&#39;m forced to conclude this issue to be from my meal at JC&#39;s from the other night. 

The layout of this place is way confusing. When you walk in, someone should be there to greet you, but instead, we walked in to what appears to be an empty lobby and small unused dining area to your right. There is also a counter that I can only assume was once used for take out orders but they are using it for their drink mixing machines. Eventually, someone will appear to greet you as it appears they have it down to a science of occasionally peeking around the corner to see if anyone has walked in. Maybe a bell is in order, JC&#39;s?

The menus are, shall we say, &#34;well used&#34;? Ok, they are falling apart. Both my husband&#39;s and my menu came apart in our hands. The mild salsa they serve is a little bland and needs salt which thankfully can be found on the white linen tablecloth covered table. Their chips are not made in house but they do serve them warm which is a nice touch! I asked for their hot salsa the other night and was given a ketchup bottle of what appeared to be a green salsa but because the bottle was quite dirty, I decided not to even use it. I was a little grossed out, truth be told.

The husband ordered steak fajitas which looked AMAZING and I chose the enchiladas and mixed up two chicken and one steak. The food came out unequivocally fast. It was faster than most drive thru spots. I was pleasantly surprised at the speed but after dinner, realized that I wasn&#39;t feeling well and I can only figure that maybe some of my chicken may have been undercooked? I tasted my husband&#39;s fajitas and they were cooked nicely and served with the perfect amount of peppers and onions. They are a little stingy with their rice but maybe I&#39;m just use to other places serving a larger portion. 

The service was excellent the first time we came here and quite lacking on our most recent visit. We had to flag down a server for refills but they were quick to clear the tables. Almost as though, they wanted us in and out. I&#39;m happy to have a clear table but when they take plates that are still being used, I&#39;m not as happy! After feeling unwelcome, we were then quick to get the bill and get out of there.

Unfortunately, I&#39;m not in a big hurry to return."

I tried JC&#39;s about two years ago with my son. The most memorable part was the super sweet waitress. The food was forgettable at the time and I have driven past hundreds of times since. Last week, the hubby and I were trying to decide on something different for dinner. I remembered JC&#39;s and said we could give them a try. I&#39;m so glad that we did!

When you walk in, you really don&#39;t know where to go. It looks like a carry out counter with a small waiting area. The layout is awkward, so just walk in and head back then around to the left. Still weird, but at least you will find the people back here.

Set in a small, but bright and clean dining room are maybe a dozen tables. JC&#39;s is about Mexican comfort food in a cozy environment. The waitress was just as sweet as I had remembered. And she made excellent suggestions. 

He tried a dish that came with skirt steak and a cheese enchilada. He loved both!  Rice and beans also arrived on the plate. He ate all of them and said he wished the serving size of the side dishes was a bit bigger. 

I tried the, waitress suggested, shrimp and garlic dish with lots of spices. Very tasty when I wrapped it in a corn tortilla. For me, it was a strange looking dish. I opted for all rice and no beans. Everything on the plate was orange. Not pretty to look at, but pretty tasty. 

Our glasses were kept full and the food arrived hot. Dirty dishes were promptly cleared. I&#39;d say JC&#39;s was much more memorable this time and we will head in again soon."

Everything is well made and fresh.  I have order mainly the burrito with and without suizo and it&#39;s always one of my favorite dishes.  if you&#39;re looking for something more healthy I recommend the taco bowl which is always packed with food and you definitely get your money&#39;s worth here...just $6.95 for a big taco bowl.

The service is always friendly and the wait staff always has service with a smile.  The bathrooms are also very clean and the tables are always prepared by the time you get there.  There is an option to eat outside, however the restaurant is located by the Bartlett Metra station so it can be noisy at times.  Regardless, the food will always keep you coming back to this place.  The guacamole is always tasty.  The salsa could be better since it always tastes sweet.  The chips could also be better.  They tend to be too thin and a little greasy.

However, the golden goose of this place are the huge entrees that are fresh and are definitely worth the money.  

Other than the salsa and chips, there is not much at all I can complain about this place.

Happy eating!"

We LOVE JC&#39;s.  Their service is sweet and sincere - they are appreciative that you are there.  The owner always takes time out of her schedule to come talk to us and make us feel welcome.  My husband loves the Steak a la Mexicana, and I always get the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce.  Best mole sauce I&#39;ve had in the Chicagoland area.  It&#39;s consistent.  Other restaurants let it reduce with time and it gets thick and pungent and burnt tasting.  Not JC&#39;s. 

The only downside is it can get very loud in there - they have hardwood floors and nothing to absorb noise.  One night we were there I could hear the woman across the restaurant better than my husband who was right across from me.  But that&#39;s kind of the charm of the place - at times it gets loud because people are having fun.  So if you want a nice, quiet dinner, go here early or on a weekend afternoon.

It&#39;s also fun to sit and watch all of Bartlett walk and bike past the windows the face both south and west.

Enjoy!"

We don&#39;t blame you, you just are clueless as to how authentic Mexican should taste. 

Since moving to Bartlett from Las Vegas a year ago, we have been to JC&#39;s twice. Both occasions we have not been disappointed.  As you could imagine, we come from the heart of the country that knows what these flavors should taste like.. 

They have a delicious Mole sauce that should not be missed, so try the Pollo en Mole. Really tender chicken under this beautiful dark brown sauce. 

We have also had the Pollo Ala Diabla ~ but those gentle taste-buds of most people in this area should probably avoid- especially if you have a heart condition. 

The Carne Asada is another excellent choice as is Bistek Con Rajas. Great Beef choices. 

YES - have a Mango Margarita~!  Even the traditional Over Rocks ones are delicious. 

We are always too full for dessert, but they great People surprised our mother in law with a slice of Chocolate Cake for her birthday and I was told it was very very good! 


Every thing was incredibly fresh here ! The staff was amazing and the chefs are very very good at what they do...if you enjoy actual Mexican Cooking, and not the Chi- Chi&#39;s version of it.. you will like JC&#39;s ~"

SO glad for this happy accident as I think this will be our new regular place for Mexican.

It&#39;s a cute little place and when you are seated you might feel a bit odd, like you are walking through someone&#39;s house as you pass through the register/galley area to the main dining room.  They have a great menu and it was difficult to decide on just one thing so I tried two!  The owner warned me it would be a lot of food but I assured her I wanted the leftovers.  I tried an al Pastor (pork in red sauce) Sope and a Chicken Burrito.  The al Pastor was so tender and flavorful, the Sope was perfect!  I thought the chicken in my burrito was a bit on the salty side but it might not always be that way.

Their prices are VERY reasonable...and you can order just one of this and one of that so you can sample different things rather than being stuck ordering just tacos or a burrito.  We also tried their margaritas and they were good as well, not shy with the tequila at all.  

The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was spotless.  Yes, it did take a little longer for our food to come out but it&#39;s to be expected from a smaller place during the dinner rush.  Just relax, munch on their great chips and salsa and sip your margarita while you wait for your dinner."

I live in bartlett, and wanting to try this place for a year, my mother and I went on a Saturday afternoon and wanted to sit outside, we checked in with we found it later was that owner, god was she rude, we were sitting outside and she demanded that my mother die out her cigarette, were outside with no signs posted, and she really embarrased her like she was committing a murder right there. 

We wanted another bowl of chips and salsa and she said after 2 small bowls of chips, she will charge us, in fact that extra little cup of salsa was put on our bill for 3.00 dollars. We never got water refilled, had to beg for some water. I will NEVER go there again."

Chips were really stale and the &#34;salsa&#34; was La Preferida with chunks of tomatoes in them. No water was brought to the table, nor suggested. The margaritas were guaranteed to be hand-made (not a mix) but came back with mostly handmade and mix in it. The color gave it away... Our guacamole was exactly one avocado mashed with a few onions and cilantro and had no flavor. I ordered Chilies Rellenos and one chili was flavorless with chewy steak and the other was hot and smoky flavored, just as it should have been. My husband ordered fajitas (gluten free option) that were very ordinary. This is not authentic Mexican food. Please visit Los Comales, Bien Trucha (bring $$$) if you want a true Mexican taco.

We ordered steak burritos which seem to be 85% salt. 

I was only able to eat less than half of it and that is where I discovered a teaspoon of sour cream. I was unable to douse out the salt taste with my own salsa on hand, the red and green sauce they gave was retched. 

There are tons of great reviews for this place and I wonder if they have had a change of chef&#39;s or did they get too cocky and give up on the food quality?"

The Sopes are terrific. My wife and I had never had them prior to JC&#39;s. We&#39;ve tried them now at other places and JC&#39;s have the best!

The only small knock on the place is their small location. Only because we have small kids and like to have some room between other diners and us (for the other diners sake)."

Maybe we are all desperate living here in Bartlett. Yes, I think we are. This is standard fare, and the flan was so incredibly tasteless I was angry while I was eating it. Whipped cream would help tons.
  
It wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t great. People were really nice. Cute little place and you can sit outside. The train got to be really obnoxious. Is there a time of day that trains don&#39;t go by?
  
I guess, if I didn&#39;t have Flan at La Tosca in Arlington Heights (no, I am not a spy), I would have been just unimpressed. For the calories, I&#39;d like to be impressed. 
  
Someone said the mole was great. It was good. But it was sweet. Not my type of mole. Spicy, yes; sugar no. We ordered steak enchiladas and got chicken. They were too busy and the service too slow for us to want to fix that, so we didn&#39;t say anything.

Guacamole. Just OK. There was not salt on the table. That would have helped bring out some flavor. Margarita. Also, just ok. I don&#39;t think there was much alcohol in it. I didn&#39;t even get chatty.
  
It isn&#39;t a bad place. Better than the other mexican restaurant in the area. Go here Bartlett peoples, but I think it is over-rated here. ...so you know and are not disappointed."

The only reason I&#39;m giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because I can&#39;t comment on the dine-in experience and their guac isn&#39;t great. It&#39;s ok, but kinda bland and cound use a little salt or lime to kick it up."

I felt so bad but that wasn&#39;t the only poor meal. My daughters had taco salads that could best be described as cheap bar style. The lettuce tasted stale as if it was brought in pre shredded.

Knocking a star off for the young woman who has been the hostess every single time we&#39;ve gone or picked up food. She is extremely awkward to the point where I am hoping she is not the hostess each time we go. When we walk in we usually get a blank stare and it&#39;s one of us who has to initiate any communication with her...&#34;uh yeah we are here to eat....in your restaurant....is that ok? Or should we leave?&#34; That&#39;s what I feel like saying in response to her lack of acknowledgment.  There is never a &#34;Welcome, can I get you a table?&#34; Or &#34;How can I help you?&#34; Or anything that indicates she has any interest in why we are there. Most recently we ordered for a pick up, she was in front, I stated I was there for a pick-up and gave my name. She walked away. A minute later another kid came in front and asked how he could help....apparently she doesn&#39;t communicate with the other staff either. 

The chips are store bought. Others say the Guac is very plain, but that&#39;s how I like it, so no complaint about that. We did notice the prices had increased in the Guac recently, and I will say now you can probably go to Jewel, get much better and much more Guac and an entire bag of home-made chips for less. 

The rest of the food we have had no complaints about. I usually get the enchiladas or chimichanga and my husband always gets a burrito. We will still go and enjoy the outdoor seating once the warm weather returns."

But when I started reading the menu I noticed a meal I had never had before: a Torta. It&#39;s kind of like an americanized mexican sandwich made with a bolillo role, similar to french bread. It&#39;s filled with beans, sour cream, your choice of meat, an optional sauce, lettuce, and tomato. It was so good. My friend ordered a salad.

When we went, it was early before the dinner crowd where it was not busy, so not sure why they weren&#39;t paying attention to us. Also when we first entered, the two girls in front were having a personal conversation with each other and we had to wait about a minute for them to end their girl talk before they acknowledged us and seated us.

A friend of mine raves about their green enchiladas, to which I heartily agree that they are quite good.

The owner knows me by name and always greets me with a smile and seats me promptly. She asks me follow up questions on conversations we may have had from previous visits. I&#39;ve seen her treat other regular customers the same.

Recently, after finishing my typical order of green enchiladas with a side of guacamole, I asked the owner where she buys her avocados. When I go grocery shopping, the avocados I find (especially in midwinter) tend to be lacking in flavor, overripe or going bad. I don&#39;t have much luck in finding good avocados. But, I was impressed with the quality and flavor in the guacamole at JC&#39;s.

The owner let me in on her secret to good avocados. She&#39;s got it down to a science in determining how solid the avocados are when you first buy them, how long to let them ripen, where to store them, etc. And though she buys from a wholesaler, which I don&#39;t have access to, she offered to sell me avocados direct from her restaurant whenever I wanted. And so, I added a few to my tab last time I was there.

How&#39;s that for service? And I think it all started a few years ago when I stopped in at JC&#39;s for the first time. I complimented the owner on her voice when she was softly singing to the Spanish music playing overhead. I&#39;ve had nothing but good service ever since. See what happens when you&#39;re nice to people and expect good things! 

And though the service may be slow at times, or maybe it&#39;s not the perfect Mexican restaurant for everyone, or maybe the shipment of avocados isn&#39;t always the best, I still love the fact that it is a family owned restaurant and that I get a genuine sense of welcome whenever I visit. The minor things don&#39;t really matter that much when one is treated like a valued customer."

Food is pretty good.  We had the Camarones Rancheras and enjoyed trying something new.  They put the red salsa on the tables but I heard the waiter say that they also have the green salsa if you ask.  We will be back this summer.

I really enjoyed how it is a family owned establishment, and its location in their house! It has a very cozy atmosphere, and was surprisingly busy for a Saturday night. We had to watch at least 20 minutes for a table, which wasn&#39;t terrible, but odd for a small place in the suburbs.

The food was delicious. I had the Steak Enchiladas with Green Sauce. I was impressed with how fresh everything was. I only ate about half my meal because it was so filling, and the price was great for the portion size. I tasted my friends&#39; dishes like the Chimichanga, Steak Tacos, and the Vegetarian Tostadas. They were all tasty. I also had Horchata, and it was fabulous, so much, that I had 2 :P

The only thing that didn&#39;t impress me about about this place was the service. We had two servers, which was unusual, and caused a lot of confusion when our drinks and food were being brought out. There were also big gap times in between drinks and order-taking. I had to take off two stars for that because it was pretty annoying, especially when we were all really hungry, but I am hoping it was just a one-time thing. I would not mind coming back here again if I am in the mood for some pretty good Mexican in the suburbs, though!"

We tried it again this weekend to see if things have improved and I&#39;m sorry to say they have not.  

In my opinion (that&#39;s what this is all about) mediocre food, bad drinks, bland guacamole.  I do not think we will be coming back, sorry, we tried."
jcs-mexican-restaurant-bartlett,Sean D.,WmBC_Lsu6R8N0H6drs01ow,"Bartlett, IL",0,1,0,11,19,arFmYkfN_pnK6CphRdIqRw,5.0,2012-04-07,"This is another one of our staples that I&#39;m finally getting around to writing a review about.  Since this placed popped up it&#39;s been the only Mexican place we frequent anymore.  I used to wait tables at a Mexican restaurant many years ago, so I can be pretty picky about my Mexican food.  The food here is good especially if you know what to order and actually have taste buds and don&#39;t think that Chipotle is the gold standard in &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican cuisine. (Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Chipotle but if you go into a real Mexican restaurant expecting that, then you should have just gone there in the first place.)  

Anyway, I will have to admit that it is a small place with hard wood floors so it can be quite noisy. They should probably hang some tapestries on the wall to absorb some of the sound.  The service is friendly and they all know us. The owner is a sweet woman who dotes on my daughters every time we go in.  There&#39;s almost no turnaround in the wait staff, and yeah they are not going to get a Michelin star for their skills anytime soon but they do a good job and they earnestly care about your satisfaction.  It is a small place and like most small places they don&#39;t handle sudden pops well as they don&#39;t have that turn and burn thing down.  I find that to be a good thing though as they don&#39;t rush the food.  We don&#39;t go in there when we&#39;re in a hurry.  Although I&#39;ve really noticed they seem to be getting better at handling the rushes lately.  

Anyway, the important thing is the food.  Most everything is very good although my personal fav is the Tampiquena (carne asada steak with a cheese enchilada on top) to which I add mole sauce.  The asada is made the traditional way, heavily seasoned and tenderized (pounded thin).  Comes with corn tortillas, guac, etc. and the mole on top is my own touch. They have wonderful mole sauce here. The real deal.  Good Mole sauce is one of those things for me that separates the boys from the men if you will.  If you don&#39;t know what it is let me just warn you that its rich so get it on the side your first time.  Its also the one sauce you will find that you can get from ten different places and get ten radically different concoctions.  Some places may otherwise have decent food but a horrible mole.  JC&#39;s mole is IMHO the real deal.   With the asada, the mole, and the soft corn tortillas, you can make your own little fajitas.  It&#39;s certainly not light fare. Kind of like fajitas for foodies. :-)  also worth noting are the enchiladas (green or red, both good) and the Mexican style tacos.  Unfortunately they don&#39;t make tamales anymore because they didn&#39;t sell enough to justify making big pots of those labor intensive items.  Also, I&#39;m always stealing French fries from my kids, they are very good here. Oh and the Flan is always tasty.  Margaritas used to be a bit lacking. I think most people would be fine with them but I&#39;m picky (see above comment about my past) and I like to make them from scratch at home on occasion.  But while we used to send them back years ago, over the last year or so they&#39;ve improved to the point where we will actually order another round.  

All in all, this is a great local family restaurant for good authentic home cooking kind of Mexican food.  The friendly owner and almost zero turnaround of wait staff makes this a good place to be a regular and get recognized for it and treated as such."

The food isn&#39;t anything to rave about, just your typical Mexican food, and trust me, not all of there stuff is homemade. 

And now on to the service; it&#39;s awful. Even when we have been here for lunch it has been extremely slow. At least the food comes out fast, but don&#39;t drink your drinks too fast or you will wait forever to get a refill. Maybe if you didn&#39;t have one server in the whole restaurant this may be different.

The food itself is nice but the service was something else! I have been there 3 times and each time the service was SLOW! On the final time I went the owner who tried to take the portion of my food plate away (as if I had been there long enough). I told her I wasn&#39;t done and she then tried to take the tortillas away. My drink had been empty for 20 minutes and when I asked her why my server hadn&#39;t asked me for a refill or why the service was so slow she said my table (outside on the farthest right) was not part of the section and my server was busy (although the table right next to mine was being consistently served BY HER)! She is the owner all the tables are HER section! I told her I like the food but the service was really bad which she replied... &#34;That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like to serve Mexicans, because they cause to much trouble!&#34; The horrible person is Mexican with a Mexican restaurant! Of course she was smart about it and stated the comment in Spanish so the table next to me wouldn&#39;t catch wind of the hypocrisy of this woman. I noticed the same treatment by the servers and its common for them to treat minorities differently then white customers. I&#39;m not the only person who has had this situation happen... many of my friends have seen this from them and avoid this spot.

The enchiladas had a runny slap of sour cream on top and the meal was pretty bland. The burrito was okay but nothing special. No one asked us how our food was even though 3 different servers kept passing us (never our original server). We finally received our check about 20 minutes after finishing eating, when a different server offered to remove our plates. I had to ask if he could get our server so we could get our check.

Food is not the best Mexican I ever had, but it is not the worst either.  For me, the main reason is distance (close to home) and price is reasonable.  I had the soft tacos a few times (different meat; Mexican style).  They are decent.  The Guacamole was always  good and I had never experienced the stale chips.  I tried the burrito once and it was good too.  I would not considered the food very authentic Mexican, which was a surprise to me since the owner &amp; staffs are."

My husband ordered a steak stew of some sort that was made with homemade salsa verde and it was incredibly fresh and flavorful. I ordered enchiladas and I always say if a Mexican restaurant can&#39;t make good enchiladas then there just not authentic. This place made each and every one of their own salsas and the enchilada sauce. The attention to detail on everything extends into their deliciously mixed cocktails, there margarita is fresh lime and their sangria is no sugar mix, only fresh fruit. The atmosphere I agree is small and quaint, but it is comfortable and I don&#39;t go to a restaurant for the decor anyways, I go for delicous food I can&#39;t make at home.

The place is small, and can get very noisey, but in the spring and summer time they do have an outside eating area where they set up tables and chairs right outside the door on the sidewalk. It&#39;s wonderful sitting out there in the summer drinking a Strawberry Margarita..mmmm   :)
Anyway! The food is spectacular! Everything is homemade. You HAVE to order the Guacamole! You won&#39;t be disapointed I promise! It is the absolute best I&#39;ve ever had! Sometimes my friends and I go there just to get Margarita&#39;s and the Guac! So Tasty! They give chips and salsa to munch on before your dinner arrives, which is very tasty as well. Not too spicy but just enough! My favorite dish there is the Chicken Enchilada&#39;s. It is out of this world! And it is presented beautifully. The amount of food that is on each platter is very generous with great pricing! The staff there is all family, which is nice to see. They are very pleasant people.

Service was ok, but I didn&#39;t appreciate having my dinner served 10 minutes after the rest of my party.  For crying out loud, they should have been able to properly time everything so that everyone at a table gets served at one time.

My wife, drug-dealing daughter from Dairyland [Wisconsin pharmacist], and I were spending Black Friday morning at the obscure Woodfield Mall in the quaint village of Schaumburg (I doubt you ever heard of it), and we were on our way eastbound to other obscure shopping destinations when pangs of hunger arrested our progress.  Fortunately for us, we had a $10 off coupon for Buona - and that was where we stopped for a brief repast.  Otherwise, I was prepared to dumpster dive behind the Meijer Market across the street.

Buona is much of what a Chicago-style fast food emporium should be like.  It is clean, well-managed, reasonably priced, and has a nice selection of sandwiches, salads, etc.  You order at the counter, and they bring out the order to your table when it is ready.  Their people are friendly and helpful.

One drawback:  Mrs. B is a well-known soda pop snob and critic, and she complained that they only offer Pepsi beverage products.  She does not consider the &#34;Pepsi&#34; appellation contrôlée to be worthy of people of her gastronomic caliber.  According to her sophisticated &#34;nose,&#34; the bouquet is not quite mature enough and is off-taste: her standard of excellence is 1996 vintage Diet Coke marked with a &#34;cRc&#34; inside a triangle.  [Go figure out this riddle!]  

As far as I am concerned, I don&#39;t care: as long as I can belch afterwards, I am satisfied.

But, Mrs. B awarded the women&#39;s restroom with her seal of approval: it was in A-OK shape.  AND she liked her Italian Beef plate, too!

My daughter and I ordered their chicken sandwiches, and we were most satisfied.  The presentation and preparation were great.  I really liked the mustard that accompanied the sandwich, too.  Minor quibble: I would have liked a few more fries.

Buono Beef is a great place for most anyone."

I have eaten at Buona since I was old enough to order off the kids menu! 
I haven&#39;t physically eaten inside in years, but I frequent the drive thru and catering counter. 

These days, I love to kick back with a movie and a Buona Beef!
I frequent the catering counter about once a month.
I always order 1 pound of Italian Beef (w/ Gravy, Hot Giardiniera, and a loaf of Turano) and 1 pound of Hot n&#39; Ready Italian Sausage (w/ Sweet Peppers and a loaf of Turano) to make my own Italian Beef / Sausage sandwiches at home!

I simply pour the gravy into a crock pot, heat it up, then put the beef in. 
Buona Beef never disappoints! The beef is always tender, juicy, and well seasoned. 
The Italian Sausage is tender, flavorful, and filling! It&#39;s always nice to make a &#34;combo&#34; sandwich for a taste that is out of this world! 

The Turano bread is always soft and fresh &amp; the sweet peppers are INCREDIBLE!
I also love the Spicy Giardiniera on my Italian beef! 

There is always plenty of food for my father and I, usually leaving left overs for the next day. (Nothing wrong with Buona two days in a row! )

The service at the counter is always friendly, quick, and helpful!
They even offer to take it to your car for you! 
We routinely get Buona during football and hockey season! 

QUICK TIP: Order a small order of their Parmesan chips when you pickup your at-home order at the catering counter. They are fresh made and out of this world! Also, you cannot go wrong with their french fries. Traditional steak fries, served piping hot! You never get a cold order here! 

Believe me, leave Portillo&#39;s in the dust and get yourself a beef sandwich, italian sausage sandwich, or chicago style hot dog at Buona! 

Buona is CHICAGO."

Good-bye Portillo&#39;s, Hello Buona! OK, except for their Chicken Chopped Salad... Buona, we need to do something about that.

You have been around for as long as I can remember and you have stood the test of time. The quality of ingredients, food preparation and food service have not changed, compromised or become lackadaisical with the shift in how we eat. 

We have become fast food junkies and careless about what we consume. What costs a dollar or is mass produced, frozen and refrozen saves me money now is guaranteed to bankrupt me with medical bills later.

I hope you continue to preserve your integrity by reminding us that fast food can still be good food no matter how big the franchise may become. You don&#39;t ask me to wait by the counter contaminating your work space; instead, we take a seat and someone brings our order to us when it is ready, not when it&#39;s warmed up. 

Thank you for not charging me full price when I ask for just a grilled chicken patty and nothing else; which literally means without the buns, condiments, veggies or mayo &#39;to go&#34; for my dog like Portillo&#39;s does. More noteworthy, you never waste my money by serving me rubbery fake shit that I can&#39;t cut, tear apart and she refuses to eat!

I feel that Buona is definitely boner-inspring (not that I&#39;d know..): I love their sandwiches.  The Turkey Delizioso was my fave when I was eating meat more.  Now the Grilled Portobello Provolone Veggie sandwich is my go-to.  It&#39;s HUGE - I usually divide it in half or thirds and it lasts at least two meals.  

The fries are delicious steak fries, but some Buonas don&#39;t cook them well.  (They&#39;re great here!)

The day we came in, I had great service.  I was very indecisive about getting the order To Go or to dine in, and the girl who took our order was very patient and accommodating.  We got bags to go, but she also brought us plates.  (She gave us a number and then brought our food out to us.)

It kind of reminds me of Portillo&#39;s as they have the same mic system where they announce the order as you tell the cashier what you want to eat.

Their menu is a lot of items and it would take a long, long time for me to try them all out. I ordered the Turkey Deliciouzo which was a turkey sandwich with cucumbers, lettuce, tomato, and mayo (no mayo for me). You have the choice of getting just the sandwich, or the meal, which includes the sandwich, fries, and a drink. The fries were pretty tasty, but I feel it could have used a little bit more salt. Better unsalted, than over-salted! Next time in, I might &#34;splurge&#34; on my diet and go for their delicious-looking pizzas.

Once you ordered, they give you a placard with a number on it, and you put the number on the table, in which a server will locate you and deliver the food to your table. The service and staff was friendly and nice. 

BATHROOM REVIEW: The bathrooms were pretty clean looking, and consisted of a urinal and stall. The toilet looked clean and the urinal was in good working order. The stall doors appear to be nice and sturdy so you can drop your pants and not feel like someone could barge in. Sit or squat? Sit!!"

I wasn&#39;t as impressed as i had hoped I would have been.  I had their Original 7&#34; beef sandwich, with cheese and sweet peppers.  I also ordered an serving of fries. 

The beef had a nice flavor to it, but the cheese was lacking.  I barely notice any on my sandwich and almost thought they forgot to put it on?!  Um...oh wait, there it is.  The peppers were ok.  Not raw, but not overly done either.  Not much flavor to them, but they were edible.  The roll was a standard Italian roll you get at most places, yet it seemed smaller than i was expecting.

I chose to eat there, so my meal was served diner style on a white plastic plate.  My serving of fries were placed on the plate, next to my wrapped sandwich.  That was kind of confusing.  Why would they wrap the sandwich, but leave the fries out on the plate?  The serving of fries seemed smaller than most other beef places.  The fries themselves were standard diner steak fries.  Most likely frozen before hitting the deep frier.  The taste was about what you&#39;d expect for those type of fries.

The service was ok.  If you dine in, they bring your order out to you.  That&#39;s alright, i guess.  The people didn&#39;t go out of their way to make sure i had a nice experience, but they weren&#39;t rude either.  The girl who took my order, did come out to ask how my sandwich was?  She didn&#39;t ask anyone else, so i suspect it was only because she was cleaning tables near me?

Overall, i think I&#39;d skip going back to this place.  I&#39;ll take Portillo&#39;s over Buona any day."

Good chilli and burgers. Their hot dog is small and overpriced. The fries are rather bland tasting but generally seem to be made to order."

There is something for everyone: healthy salad options as well as pizza and sandwiches for the less calorie-conscious. This is a plus when trying to pick a lunch place for a group of people.

My personal favorite is the tuna salad sandwich because it is made with olive oil instead of mayonnaise. If you&#39;re not a mayonnaise person, you&#39;ll appreciate this! Also, the house-made parm potato chips are awesome."

Branching out, we love the specialty Pizzas, which fall towed the California Pizza Kitchen realm - the Chicken Pinolo, Alfredo Prosciutto, and the Beef &amp; Giardiniera (which is a pizza version of a Italian Beef sandwich) are our favorites.   The Buffalo Ranch Chicken salad is also a standout. In the summer they have a Spinach salad that&#39;s a winner.  Unfortunately, the Pasta Salad has become shoddy lately - missing Artichoke Hearts and some level of vinegar in the dressing.  It varies a lot from day to day, unfortunately.  The grilled PANINIS can be very good, but the Italiano is just serviceable as a sub.   Still, you come here for the Beef sandwiches... just don&#39;t overdo it.

The selection alone is large enough that it&#39;ll take a few more tries. Came here with a co-worker and I had the turkey sandwich which was excellent. My co-worker ordered the pepperoni pizza which isn&#39;t normally an exciting dish but this tasted great. It&#39;s a large space with plenty of seating. The only thing I would say they work on is friendliness. The woman who took our order was very short with us and acted as though she was doing a chore.

One thing, all their pizza seem to be very spicy. So be careful with your order, don&#39;t order pizza if you don&#39;t like spicy food.

The Italian beef is OK.  Make sure you tell them how you want it.  This is a crucial part to ordering it anywhere.  Some may find it too different here, for instance, they use a thin long french bread.   For the money it doesn&#39;t seem like much.  But.  It has gotten better over the years.  I tried this place when it opened a few years back and I hated it! 
The Italian beef sucked.  Today its better.  
The Supremo pizza is filling and priced about $5.25 for a personal.  Bigger than what you would get at Pizza hut.  As with one of the other reviews about the condiments.. it is a hassle to go looking around for the condiment needed.  Crushed red pepper &amp; parmesan is only found at the pick-up area.  While they deliver food to the table, they don&#39;t bring any pizza condiments to your table.  
If you are real hungry try the double cheeseburger.  I couldn&#39;t get it all down.  I was really hungry. Chompin&#39; down the steak fries was easy, they were just right.  The burger, I almost had to use a knife.  The bun is big and bakery style.  The burger looked presentable, this is not a char house burger.  Great taste for value.  
There are many food options, pizza, beef, cold sandwiches, panini&#39;s, ribs and I think pasta.  The price can get to you, to combo anything is an additional $2.59 +/ -.  So, most items that are combo&#39;d could range around $8-$11 bucks and then add tax.  Its usually in pristine condition. I&#39;ve never seen them busy, yet.  They have A TV in the back.  And they serve beer.  The seats are comfy.  
Would I go out of my way to get it? No.  
If in the area and its not busy.  Fo&#39; sho&#39;."

It&#39;s probably because this is the only place within a few miles of us that serves lengua  (tounge) tacos. For what it&#39;s worth, those are pretty good. 

The pros: Aforementioned lengua tacos. Portion size, you will be full, guaranteed. Speed, you will be full fast, like within 5 mins of placing your order. 

Cons: With speed comes a trade off in quality. The guacamole is a dull yellow instead of a vibrant green, and tasted like it had no seasoning whatsoever. The rice was falling apart, like they used rice made much earlier in the day, and all of the seasoning started clumping up instead of being evenly distributed. The last big thing I noticed was that the horchata was incredibly diluted. Which was OK because I need to cut back on sigar, but not ok because I paid for a large glass of horchata flavored water.

Maybe it was one of their slower days (saturday lunch) and they compensated by skipping on some of the freshness and taste today. But consistency will always be your friend when looking for customers, and today they didn&#39;t deliver."

Staff lackluster but efficient.   They make the food and call it out from the counter, where you are supposed to go get it.  Its a fine system I guess, but they did not share it with me, so had to repeat a few times my order.  I might have just brought it out at some point when it was clear I was not &#34;hearing&#34; it.

Tacos are made fresh to order and I would get 2-3 if you are making that your meal. Tortas bun is soft like a baby&#39;s bottom and has good flavor. I wish they put a little more guacamole though. Good combo for first timers would be the tortas and a taco of your choice (pork was good)

The place is a little small but it never gets too busy where you are not able to sit down. It&#39;s decent prices and again huge portions. I am 100% sure you can make two meals out of the giant!

Took a chance and glad I did.  Got the chicken burrito, tasty and very large portion...ended up splitting it with my daughter.  Price is right for what you get, only waited 5 minutes for my walk in order.

Large menu, will come back.

Only drawback for me was soda choice....they have what I call no-name brands (RC Cola, etc).  Being the diet coke addict that I am, was disappointed with that."

Steak, chorizo, chicken, and ground beef tacos. The chicken and chorizo were especially tasty...

Seating is a bit limited, when we have had large groups we made sure to go early as this place gets packed (line waiting outside and the room filled to capacity that a fire marshal might have issues with!)

There are only 4 small booths seating four, another booth for two and one long table that will accommodate 8.  Yes, they take cash only so be prepared but BDB will be gentle to your wallet.  The 2 tacos, rice and refried beans special for $5.00 is the best deal around.  I ordered the 2 steaks tacos special (no up charge to get steak), a basket of chips and salsa and a small Jarritos tamarind for just $8.29.  The tacos were perfect!  The rice was fluffy and had a nice kick to it.  I normally just pick at refried beans because the lard used in the cooking is usually so overwhelming.  Not here at Buenos Dias.  The frijoles were delicious.  The chips and salsa were just so-so but who cares.   Great taco meal for so cheap and the option to order a Jarritos fountain drink (at no extra charge compared to a boring soft drink) made this a super lunch pick.
Buenos Dias?  It certainly is!"

Nothing fancy but definitely yummy and affordable. If you don&#39;t like rice, beans or all those other fillers they put in burritos be sure to tell them.

There&#39;s a wait for the food; I guess they make it there.  I couldn&#39;t tell from the chicken in my the chicken soft taco platter, with 3 tacos, rice and refried beans, for about $7.  The chicken filling looked like something that was sitting in a warmer all day.  It was in some kind red soggy sauce. The green sauce is deliciouso and spicy! I did have enough left over for lunch the next day too.
I also hate when restaurants charge for drink refills.  At least I can fill the cup myself, so the whole thing isn&#39;t full of ice.  But the cup costs more than the soda I poured in it, let me get 1 measly refill."

This is definitely a Ma and Pop joint... Cash only!!  so if your going here don&#39;t forget that.

The inside is small, with a few tables.  But the staff here are very friendly.  Love the tacos here... I&#39;ve had their chicken, steak, ground beef.. love it.  The best thing that I love here is their hot sauce.  I would ask for it on the side... and it usually comes in a little plastic container.  Do not try this if you cannot stand &#34;hot&#34; food... As I am eatting my tacos, I love to sip the hot sauce!! yes I said sip... LOL

It&#39;s awesome!  A taco plate runs for about $7, which comes with 3 tacos beans and rice... so not bad at all.  Food is usually prepared quickly and every thing is always packed nicely.  I have no complaint.

My favorite thing here is the Horchata.  Its absolutely great!!!  I can drink a pitcher of this stuff... if I allow myself to.  

I definitely recommend going here if you have a craving for some Mexican food... there&#39;s lots on the menu to pick from.  I&#39;ve tried a few things here, but I still keep going back for the tacos... 

Just writing about this place makes me want some mexican food from there right now.   YUM!!  =)"

My favorite taco place, since I moved, is now more of a 15-20 minute drive, whereas this is just down the street.  They no longer are cash only (or maybe they just take cards if they like you?) which is great as I rarely have cash on me and always had to remember to bring cash.  I get my standard 3 steak tacos american and mexican style (lettuce cheese tomatoes cilantro &amp; onions)  The meat isn&#39;t quite as flavorful as my favorite place, but it&#39;s pretty darn close and does the job in a pinch.  The green sauce for the tacos is great.  I love having extra containers of it to add to various meals throughout the week.  I always take my order to-go, so if you plan on eating here it&#39;s very small with only a few tables.  But so far most taco places (outside of my favorite, el tesoro) the smaller the building the better the quality.  i also really like their french fries here (fries with tacos is kind of my thing).  They have almost a sweet taste to them, but in a good way.  I haven&#39;t been able to put my finger on what they remind me of, but I&#39;m definitely a fan of that slightly sweet french fry."

This is a classic &#39;Hole in the Wall&#39; strip mall joint (love the screen door installed as 2nd door in breezeway - effective in both summer &amp; winter.)   Places like this are sometimes the best places to eat.  OK - maybe the seating is limited, and there is probably going to be some language barrier, but we are here for the food, and not the ambiance or to have an extended conversation with the cooks (before ordering I was debating between the beef or the steak burrito, so when I thought my order came up I couldn&#39;t remember which I ordered...it took a minute or two and a few translations to figure out it was actually mine...oh well, at least we know the cooks were authentic Spanish speaking grillers! )   It wasn&#39;t the best steak burrito I have ever had, but the added guac and green hot sauce made it a tasty treat!  The soft tacos got good reviews from my group today, but the beef got a thumbs down...so probably stay with the pork or steak."

Be sure to bring cash and if possible call ahead for take out.  It usually takes them about 10 minutes to prepare your delicious take out meal, however during weekends you may have to wait as they may have a line.  They also cater and have great package options.

Fresh, house-made pasta.  I had the rigatoni alla ti amo (rigatoni, sausage, peas, cream meat sauce).  It was light; not heavy like I expected for a meat &amp; cream pasta dish.  Husband had hazelnut-crusted chicken.  Again, very light.  

For dessert, we had house-made cannoli. Very crispy &amp; light.  Did not leave full &amp; achy like expected for a full Italian dinner = good thing.

The wine list is decent if dated, the food is just fine. I don&#39;t eat pasta so can&#39;t comment. It&#39;s basic Italian American fare and doesn&#39;t pretend to be anything else.

The place looks small on the inside but it has a nice, wide open ambiance.  I was greeted by the hostess, Radi, who along with her husband own the restaurant.  She was cordial and quite gracious gracious as I mentioned I was a first-timer.

Radi suggested a few favorites of customers and I chose the Vitello Parmigianna (Veal Parmesan).  The salad the accompanied the meal was OK, but the entree itself was quite tasty, with just the right amount of seasoning and sauce.  The portions were generous - there were three pieces of veal on the plate, which was accompanied by a fairly decent side of penne pasta.  I ate only one of the veal pieces and some of the penne before needing to have the entree wrapped. That will be two more meals for me.  The bread provided was also quite good.

 Another nice touch was that Radi came to the table and asked how my meal was. At first, Radi strikes you as a soft-spoken European immigrant, but you see very quickly what an outgoing and personable hostess she is.  And her accent truly makes the ambiance and experience you receive.

Later that evening, the restaurant was hosting a &#34;Wines Around the World Dinner&#34; for a fixed price.  I hadn&#39;t reserved that but I&#39;m planning to mark their next event on my planner.  I learned Ti Amo hosts a series of events like these, so I plan on making time for some of them in the future.

If you&#39;re looking for an Italian restaurant with great food that isn&#39;t too pricey, provided much of the experience of a classy downtown restaurant, and where the owners genuinely care about - and get to know - their patrons, then Ti Amo delivers on all fronts."

Everyone raved about their meals (Chicken Parm, Spaghetti Marinara, Stuffed Salmon Special, Potato &amp; Spinach Gnocci &amp; Chicken Saltimbocca) and everyone took home half their meals for leftovers since the big-portioned meal also came with soup or salad.

They put two kinds of warm bread on the table as well - Italian &amp; Focaccia - both were very good.  Their desserts looked amazing but we had dessert waiting back at the house so we took a pass.  Our server knew we were celebrating a birthday, though, and still brought over a scoop of chocolate ice cream w/whipped cream on top of a little pastry with a candle - very sweet.

The staff was all very friendly.  It&#39;s a small place but they do have a smaller section to the back where they can close the heavy curtains for a private party.  They have live music Friday and Saturday nights and the lady who was singing while we were there was absolutely fantastic!  I do recommend if you come here in the colder months do not sit next to a window or you will be freezing the entire time (we were last to arrive in our group and didn&#39;t want to ask for another table and everyone to move)."

We decided we wanted Italian for dinner. I found this place using my maps app on the iPhone 4S. 

Due to the great Yelp reviews we decided to place an order for pick up. We had the chicken parm ($15), spaghetti w/meatballs ($15) and an order of bruschetta ($6).

The location on my app had us completely lost. It is located in the Hoffman Center right across from the Mercedes Benz dealership on golf. 

The portions were just right. It was a good amount of food without being overwhelming. My fiancé said the chicken parm was the best he had in the area. My spaghetti sauce had flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The meatballs were huge but could use more seasoning. I love spaghetti &amp; so far this place is on the top of my list. 

I ate the bruschetta the next day and it was delicious. The tomatoes were flavorful and the mozzarella fresh. I couldn&#39;t imagine how much better it would&#39;ve tasted had I are it fresh.

I had the chicken parmesan and it was a 2 huge chicken breasts breaded and covered in a ton of delicious mozzarella cheese. Both came with a side of pasta. Our daughter ordered the kids chicken parmesan also and she loved it. Our portions were so big neither of us could finish it.

The food was nothing special, but the service was so impersonal and not friendly. We need to give it a third chance, though, because it&#39;s a neighborhood place for us.

Update years later: it&#39;s our friendly neighborhood place again, with consistently good and creative Italian food - one recent over-seasoned scallop special, but generally great food and a warm welcome. Also we can ride our bikes here, so terrace dining is no problem. Yay!"

I regret purchasing the groupon to try this restaurant out. I loved it under previous management and name. There is a very good reason this place is gong downhill fast.

Location is good. Far enough from the mall crowd and close enough to home. 

Once you walk in it has not only a funky smell but cheap look to it. The hostess is apparently the manager as well. 

Crowd was in their 50s+ and we were by far the youngest there. Not that that matters but it was weird when this old guy was staring at me the entire night. My husband jokingly apologized to me for continuously interrupting my love affair win the old timer. 

Upon walking in we were greeted by the hostess/manager, bus boy, waiter, girl who kept bringing us bread, and the entertainment for the night. Yes, you heard right, entertainment. 

Our waiter had the worst case of halitosis I have ever encountered. He kept speaking to me the entire time as if I was the only one at the table. I was so turned off by the smell I could hardly eat my disgusting food. 

For our appetizer we had the portabella mushroom and roster red pepper drizzled with aged balsamic and goat cheese. It sounded delicious but was completely charred. I cannot believe they actually made the server bring it out to us. I attempted to cut thru the mushroom with a butter knife to no avail. When I aggressively attempted a second time I was successful. Wishing I wasn&#39;t. It was far too charred. We sent it back and asked for them to not burn the second try. Again, no luck. We asked for the manager. 
The hostess came over and asked what was wrong. When the three of us at the table tried to explain to her that it was extremely charred she became defensive. Stating that this is her favorite dish and it tastes great. We reminded her that we couldn&#39;t taste anything because it was over grilled. She kept arguing with us and copped an attitude. After a few minutes she came back apologizing because she attempted to cut thru the mushroom in the back and experienced the same problem we noted. She then blamed it on the quality of the mushroom instead of her cook. 

I ordered the fettuccine with peas and who knows what else. There was more creme than pasta on my dish. I guess I ordered soup alla pasta and didn&#39;t know it. 

My husband had the mussels which were soooo tiny and over cooked. They didn&#39;t bring an extra bowl or bucket for him to discard the shells so he put them on the table. 

My friend ordered the spinach gnocchi which was ok but served cold. 

Let me skip to dessert....everyone hated theirs. Me: tiramisu....too much alcohol and was old. Friend: cannoli....old and gross. Husband: vanilla ice cream...$5 for two scoops. 

Best part of the evening: bread (not the focaccia because it was too greasy), entertainment, and finally leaving. 

This older woman named LaVerne served as the evening&#39;s entertainment. She sang a lot of oldies and was pretty good. She has spunk and a great attitude. 

Needless to say this place is a no go ever for me. Oh and to top it all off they are so pricey. Olive Garden is a dream compared to this hole in the wall."

The cheese was very aromatic and the warm breads were great.

Everything afterward was easy on the salt, even the soups. All the individual items in the dinner servings were individual contributors. You can taste everything in it&#39;s natural flavor. We really enjoyed the veal Michaelangelo and the stuffed salmon (on the special menu). The veggies were neither crunchy nor mushy; cooked just right. Servings were generous, including the wine. The foods were served piping hot.

The hostess and staff were charming, refined and pleasant. Ambiance was good. We had soft background music at an early Sun dinner, but we understand they may have live entertainment Fri &amp; Sat. There is an patio set up as well."

I didn&#39;t get sick but I felt badly that I got conned by a lame groupon for really average food, in a strip mall on Golf Road. It was cold in there and didn&#39;t smell great; I know what garlic smells like when it goes, that wasn&#39;t it.
Donnie D&#39;s 10/25 review set me off. NEW management? The SAME new management that she wrote about three years ago?

Maybe I got caught on a bad night, but I see a lot of similar reviews. Parking was easy, the servers were ok, the place was empty on a weeknight, we only saw one hostess/waitress and a server out of the kitchen, no owner, no music. I liked the bread and oil, but the parmesan was somehow soggy. 

Save yourself. Go to WalMart, buy some linguini, oil, powdered garlic, soggy parmesan cheese and canned baby clams. Throw it in the microwave. Turn the house heat down, have your most Italian looking South Texas child mumble low as they take it out of the microwave and serve it to you. Ooopa! Buenos Noches! Oy, the end times are here.

Update: Jan 2015- There MAY be some better service, food and music on the weekends, so NEVER come here during the week. But really why come here at all?"

Completely agree with Sarah&#39;s &#34;meh&#34; review although we did not experience the Saturday night date treatment. We got the largely empty Wed night Schaumburg NOT Romantic decor, and no owner in sight unless he was one of the two guys at the bar who never moved. No Italians sighted either, TexMex at best. If there was romantic music playing we couldn&#39;t hear it because of some constant construction pounding, more on that later.

Somebody, who does not check the Yelp reviews before buying a groupon (not me;), bought this &#34;romantic&#34; ambiance  groupon and I kept trying to picture exactly WHERE this was, in the strip mall across from House of Pho? Yep. 

There is no entertainment here on a Wednesday night in Schaumburg unless you count the constant pounding somewhere of what turned out to be Veal... we had imagined several husky plumbers trying to fix that slight sewage smell that is low key, but there. We liked our waiter and server but the food is overpriced. If their strategy is likely just to rope in out of town suckers and feed coupons to the locals, I still wouldn&#39;t recommend it. Pastas are overpriced, the Veal (well pounded ;) was ok, the cod special was surprise fried TexMex with a light brown unidentifiable sauce we scraped off.  By the glass wines were under $10 and we had a good chianti classico and syrah, and there was a $5 sauvignon blanc as a special that sounded like a deal. The soup and salad choices were forgettable although that might have been canned minestrone, I remember that.

We stuck our heads out into the &#34;garden&#34; outside patio, which is some cast iron gating and 6 foot arborvitae, and since you are a little bit lower you are actually on eye level with cars hurtling past you on Golf road at about 50 mph, only romantic if you own a body shop. 
If it had been a little warmer I might have chosen outside over the veal pounding rap. 
You can do better, Ciao!"

I don&#39;t want to be graphic but a disgusting smell hit us as we walked in and lastedt throughout dinner although we did get slightly used to it while we were there.

I went here for dinner last night with two friends...I know Saturday is date night, but the entire restaurant &amp; bar was all couples. We even had a lady turn all the way around in her chair to stare at us....kind of strange.

The portions were huge! I got the gnocchi which was just okay...not that great. One of my friends got the Linguine with clams in white which was tasty but not $18 tasty! It was expensive! The cheapest pasta dishes were $16...both the gnocchi &amp; meat ravioli fell under that category. The bread at the beginning of the meal is good, I&#39;ve had better but still decent. Our first batch was a bit stale and the second tasted a bit more fresh.

Besides the smell when we walked in, the ambiance is very cool They had a singer who was singing some of our favorite romantic songs. The owner, I would assume, greeted us in Italian and when we were seated spoke in Italian as well. The dim lighting &amp; decor suits the romantic atmosphere.

Now the service was interesting. The person filling the water was attentive, but a bit too attentive. There were probably only about 10 tables out of 25 sat so maybe that was the issue. But normally people will walk by and casually check out the water levels, if things need to be cleared, etc. This busser would walk to tables and stand for about 5 seconds right at the table looking everything over. Sometimes silently putting her hands on our empty chair and just standing there. I saw her do this to multiple tables, not just ours...it was honestly kind of creepy and felt like we were being stalked. I guess she was just trying to be on top of things but it should have been a bit more subtle. Our server was nice....nothing bad, nothing above &amp; beyond.

In the end, I won&#39;t be going back here. The atmosphere was very cool, but the food did not justify the high prices, service kind of creeped me out, and the smell was horrible."

Boyfriend and I wanted Italian so we chose this place on a whim, ignoring all the bad Yelp reviews. ..we won&#39;t make this mistake again.
We walked in to an almost empty restaurant, save for one loud table of tipsy 50 somethings...the hostess sat us right next to them instead of a quieter area of the dining room. We asked to be seated elsewhere and were told no one was available to serve us in the other sections. Not 5 minutes later another couple were seated where we asked to be. 
We were brought bread, 2 kinds...one stale and one edible. Finished the edible one and were never offered more.
We started with baked clams, they were over cooked and very bland.
Our dinners were also extremely bland. Zero flavor. The service was slow, and the live entertainment was a 70 year old lounge singer in a dress from Discovery.  Not ok grannie!!

Eventually another group arrived, but this place was nearly deserted the whole time.

Of course, this meant the service was excellent, the waiter checked on us reasonably frequently, without doing it so often that he became a bother. We were able to keep requesting more bread for dipping in oil; that was a good thing, as the bread and oil were delicious.

I ordered the gnocchi with a side of their spinach and egg soup (I forgot the exact name of the soup). Both were excellent dishes, and fine examples of Italian-style cooking.

One con to the place is it was somewhat chilly inside. We went on a cold day just after the snow fell, and the large windows that surround the interior seem to let the cold through a bit too rapidly; during the wintertime I would suggest asking the staff for a table away from the windows. This might not be an issue during more popular times when there are more people inside to generate body heat, and obviously this is not an issue during the warmer months of the year.

Overall, I will definitely be returning to Ti Amo Cafe at some point; the food was excellent, the service was great, and the pricing was well matched to the quality."

Long review: Went there when looking for an outside seating, well rated restaurant on yelp. 

Ambience: The outside seating was actually a crowded table arrangement inside a tall iron fence area. Not too bad, but nothing to write home about either.

Service: The service was prompt (we were the only ones there for dinner). But there was no wine list - I was told I can ask for any wine I like and would be told if they have that wine. 

Food: The food was clearly pre-made and not fresh at all.  I ordered the special fettuccine prosciutto pasta. It was below average. It had more green peas (this is in summers) than the pasta, and the sauce was quite average. The peas obviously all went back. My wife ordered a spinach gnocchi, which was extremely chewy and rubbery. 
The best part of the meal was the Peroni beer I had.

I would pay $25 for such a meal, but not $43 which was my eventual bill."

We will definitely be going back next month.  He holds these once a month except for the summer months.  The dining room was packed and the pairing choices were delicious. There were 6 wines and 6 dishes.  Service was perfect and attentive.  We found our new home away from home."

Service: I made a reservation which turned out to be completely unnecessary as there was only one other couple dining.  I happen to enjoy an empty restaurant because I am an awful misanthrope but we also got to literally choose our table, which was nice.  We had a server bringing bread (delicious!) with olive oil and some seriously fresh crumbled mozzarella.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive (although I imagine she had nothing else to do as she was basically our private butler for the evening).  She made sure we knew the specials and didn&#39;t laugh at our total butchery of the Italian names of our dishes. 

Food: I ordered the Chicken Tetrazzini.  It was a great big serving which allowed me to take some home for lunch the next day.  That being said, it was pretty bland. Aside from the bread crumbs baked on top of the noodles, it didn&#39;t differ much from the chicken alfredo lean cuisine I eat for lunch most days.  To be honest, I don&#39;t know the name of the dish my girlfriend got.  It was pork wrapped around cheese and egg.  It was delicious and I really wish I&#39;d gotten that or something else because it was much better than what I had.  Each entree came with soup: I had the onion soup and she had the minestrone. Both were delicious and very flavorful.  Top that off with a glass of wine each ($6/glass for riesling or moscato. Not bad) and it was an ok meal.  The food is decent, but I was expecting better.  I have only been once and I may have simply ordered something bland.  

Atmosphere: Ti Amo is a small, intimate restaurant that is good for a romantic evening or nice dinner in the burbs.  Italian music of variying genres (Opera, rock, pop) plays in the background and Italian painting and posters adorn the walls.  

My only complaint: I brought a coupon (buy one entree, get one free).  We both ordered off the specials menu because those looked like our best options.  When I gave the waitress my coupon, she informed me that the coupon doesn&#39;t apply to specials. This is not her fault as I did not present the coupon prior to ordering.  I asked her why it doesn&#39;t apply and she said that Specials are priced lower than entrees so no coupon is needed. I explained that the specials are MORE than the regular entrees ($3-8 more) and if she could make an exception.  This is where things went bad. When I asked her if she could make an exception (&#34;Is there anything you could do?&#34;) she laughed at me.  She didn&#39;t giggle and point or anything...It was more of a scoff, but it was there. As I said, I take responsibility for not having presented the coupon before ordering.  I always ask for exceptions to rules because rules are usually bendable.  Furthermore, we are your ONLY customers and a little flexibility can mean RETURN customers.  Finally, scoffing at me like that was not cool and made me feel really embarrassed.  It was extremely rude, unprofessional, and probably cost them a star on Yelp, not to mention my business.  

All in all, Ti Amo is an ok place for Italian but it has such a limited selection that is either hit or miss (in a big way).  I can&#39;t say I&#39;d go back here after what happened but I can&#39;t say that you shouldn&#39;t go here.   Give it a go and decide for yourself.  just don&#39;t bring a coupon.   

P.S. After reading some of the reviews here claiming that there were &#34;no Italians in sight&#34;, I can confirm that both of our servers were Italian, not to mention the cooks.  I am not an expert in linguistics, but I can differentiate Italian from Spanish and could clearly hear everyone speaking Italian when I was by the kitchen and the waitstaff.  The food here isn&#39;t awful, I just had a bad experience.  Some restaurants don&#39;t understand the value of a coupon and of respecting your customers."

My husband and I bought a Livingsocial coupon for this place. Does this mean we can&#39;t afford a full-price meal?? Apparently the waitress thought so! 

She comes to us and we tell her that we have a deal for a 2 entrees and 2 drinks. She was ok with that. So we place an order for a pizza and their special ravioli. She tells us that the pizza is an appetizer and not an entree. Ok, so we order another pasta and I tell her that we would like to cancel the pizza (neither my husband nor I are big eaters). Her reaction?? &#34;I FIGURED&#34;... WTH!?? The she tells us that she&#39;ll get the house salad which comes on the side. She was supposed to &#34;ask&#34; us what dressing we would like(as did waiters of the neighboring tables). But she does what? she TELLS us &#34;Balsamic Vinegar fine?&#34;and before we could ask what other dressings they have, she was out of there! So the food comes and they are both DISGUSTING! It was soggy and gross. Buy this time, we&#39;ve got TERRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD. I&#39;m pissed! The story isn&#39;t over yet. It only gets worse. She gets our check, places it on the table and says &#34;I assume you don&#39;t want dessert&#34;. WTH.!??? I love dessert. But I wonder where she got that idea from? Was it coz we had a coupon? Isn&#39;t the point of having a coupon so that you can experience the place and come back for more if you like it? Well, this place isn&#39;t getting any more of my service! 

So for all those who bought a coupon/deal online for this place, be prepared to be treated like like dirt!

And one more thing. With their prices you&#39;d think they were some kind of fancy restaurant. But all you&#39;re paying for is 5 pieces of ravioli, terrible service and you get to sit in a dingy-looking room with no ambiance what-so-ever!"

What really sold me on this place was that the owner, who is also the head chef came out to see how we enjoyed our meal.  A very nice man, who you can tell enjoys to cook for others.  He also wished me a happy birthday.  I couldn&#39;t have had a more pleasant night out."

Everything was very average from the minestrone to the caprese salad, but the biggest failure was the veal parmesan - we ordered this as a safe bet since it is difficult to mess up.  Unfortunately we were wrong, the actual veal in this dish was about as thick as lunch meat... no exaggeration.  Which means that the meal was 98% breadcrumbs,  cheese, and sauce, which makes for one soggy unsatisfying entree.  Needless to say we won&#39;t be back."

The place it self was not full (which suited us immensely) and the decors pretty light.

We were greeted by the host (who also was our waiter). We are vegetarians and asked him to recommend choices off the menu.

He recommended Minestrone Soup - it was one of the best soups that I have had in a long time - very filling and tasty. Lots of places add Beans and that gives you an uneasy kind of feeling - but not here. There are lots of carrots, beans and spinach.

The Bread Basket accompaniment that comes is amazing. The breads are fluffy and go very well with Olive Oil and Freshly ground pepper - my only grouse is that they take away the Pepper dispenser. Our server, kept refilling the bread basket and kept asking us not to hesitate if we needed more - this made us feel really good as most places, they give you stares if you ask for a refill.

For our main course we had a customized pasta with lots of veggies. It tasted very good. Beware - a single dish can be shared by two people - the quantity is huge, the quality is good. The mushrooms were diced to perfection and the green peas very good. The Alfredo sauce was a bit watery, but consistent.

The dessert at Ti Amo is something out of the world. All the desserts (which are not on the menu) are all homemade style. We had the Tiramasu and Chocolate Cake. The Tiramasu was well flavored and not overly sweet as in many places. The flavors were delectable.

One suggestion that I do have is for them to improve their wine selection - that would make this place really good.

Overall a simple Vegetarian meal for 2 costs around $50 - and this is one place we would like to go back to."

I&#39;m surprised by the amount of negative reviews. Both times we left full with leftovers for the next day and where generally pleased. 

True it&#39;s small with a limited menu, and service may be only average but certainly adequate. 

If you are in the neighborhood, in the mood for Italian and want to avoid all the chains, stop in, it&#39;s worth a try."

We went early in the week so it wasn&#39;t packed.  There were a few people at the bar but no one, aside from us, in the dining room.  The dining room itself was dark as they only had half the lights on, to save money I suppose.  Also, I guess the AC wasn&#39;t working since it was pretty warm despite sitting next to the floor fans.

We ordered the bruschetta to start with and it was ok.  Honestly, I have had better.  The bread was burnt and I didn&#39;t see any basil on top.  Just tons of tomatoes and a little bit of mozzarella and oil.  My guess is if the bread hadn&#39;t been burnt, the bruschetta may have tasted better, but who knows. 

For dinner I ordered the Penne Arrabbiata and again, it was ok.  The portion size was big, but I wasn&#39;t a fan of the arrabbiata sauce.  It tasted a bit too acidic for me, even with the load of parmesan I put on top.  My spouse ordered the daily special which was a skirt steak with risotto and he said the steak was nicely marinated and the risotto had a great flavor to it.

Dessert was definitely the highlight of the whole meal.  They don&#39;t have a dessert menu.  Instead, they bring out a homemade dessert tray.  I decided to try the tiramisu since it is an Italian restaurant and WOW.  The tiramisu was light and airy without being overwhelmingly sweet.  I finished the whole thing it was that good.

Overall, I would say our experience here was ok, but I&#39;m not just ready to write this place off...especially since my spouse enjoyed his food, even though I didn&#39;t.  I definitely plan on going back to try some other items off their menu.  Maybe I&#39;ll find something else to my liking."

The atmosphere is very cozy and intimate.  It would be a great place for date night too.
When you arrive they serve you bread and oil, which was very tasty.  I ended up ordering the Gnocchi de Spinaci.  It was delicious, cooked perfect, and the vodka cream sauce was scrumptious.  The portions are a good size.  I couldn&#39;t stop eating my food, but ended up completely stuffed about halfway.  Dinner for the next day?  Yes please!  I also had a glass of Moscato.  Any restaurant that serves Moscato make me a happy girl.  They don&#39;t have a drink menu on their website, but they do have a full far.  The bar area isn&#39;t huge but it&#39;s super cute and I plan on going there for drinks sometime too.
The service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive.  The hostess was very friendly too.  We asked if we could leave a car in their parking lot for a few hours and it was no problem at all.

Ti Amo Cafe gets an A for effort in my latest vist. After ordering the Skirt Steak medium rare I received not only one medium well steak but two in a row! This also happened to another person in my party. So out of a possible 5 medium rare steaks 4 of them were cooked medium well. 

I know what you are thinking....why are you are ordering steak at a small Itailan Resterant. Well it came reccomended and I am a sucker for Skirt Steak. What can I say?

Other low lights include: After the second steak came out wrong I asked for it to be taken off the bill as I was no longer hungry. Instead 10 minitues later (by this time the rest of my party has completed there meals) I receive a third steak that is included in the final bill. 

Free desert was not good either."

Upon entering, we had to wait a few minutes until the one...(yes, one) waitress acknowledged us. We asked about the lunch buffet and were given a description that sounded quite tasty...and agreed that we&#39;d both order the $8.99 (or whereabouts) buffet. 

As we turned the corner into the tiny dining room to check out the buffet, we were taken aback at how SMALL the so-called buffet was. This &#34;buffet&#34; consisted of 4 or 5 small aluminum hotel pans of food, (ie: salad, vegetables, mishapen pieces of pizza bread, some pasta) and decided that we&#39;d just order from the main menu, thinking that food must be better.

Ah. Not so.

Our menu consisted of a flimsy sheet of 8x11 paper that looked wrinkled, accompanied by a small piece of paper with the daily specials. Not only could we barely distinguish between menu courses (antipasti, secondi, etc), the menu was incredibly small for an Italian restaurant, with only the bare minimum. I ordered the &#34;Ti Amo&#34; panini and my boyfriend went for the pepperoni pizza. 

Our highlight of the meal was probably the bread + butter/olive oil/parmesan. As we filled up on the bread, we waited and waited for our food...probably because the one (again...yes, just one) waitress was so busy scrambling between tables. We finally received our meals but unfortunately the sandwich I received was not what I had ordered. Surprisingly apologetic, the waitress went back to get the right sandwich made. I munched on my fries while my boyfriend tried to rescue his pizza, adding salt, pepper and parmesan to the watery mess of cheese and sauce with five (if even) large slices of pepperoni. I don&#39;t know about you, but that&#39;s not enough pepperoni to be called a pepperoni pizza! 

I was finally given the RIGHT sandwich, but by this point, I was so full of french fries and bread that I just barely ate anything. I don&#39;t know how I could&#39;ve anyway. The prosciutto was piled so high that I had to literally gnaw at the sandwich. Although prosciutto is, by nature, somewhat chewy, this seemed above and beyond the normal texture that I&#39;d expect from good prosciutto. 

I ended up taking home both sandwiches, but I can already tell that the prosciutto/mozzarella sandwich will probably end up in the garbage.

All in all, we won&#39;t be going back and we&#39;ll trust our instincts next time and go to our favorite restaurants instead."

The scallops, veal marsala, skirt steak/risotto and pasta dishes pleased everyone&#39;s taste wonderfully.

The spaghetti with meat sauce was so acidic it burned and it was painful to eat. The tuna steak was alright but it was swimming in oil and it had to have been cooked in the microwave. All salad and veggies are definitely bought in a bag and have no flavor. I don&#39;t know why they are cutting corners.

Between my husband and myself, we&#39;ve tried just about everything on the menu.  For starters, among other appetizers, we&#39;ve tried the baked goat cheese, but nothing will ever beat the mussels.  Delicious!!! The linguine with white or red clam sauce is outstanding.  There were so many clams!  The skirt steak, when it&#39;s ont he special menu, is a delightful dish that can easily be shared.  The savory fish dishes will always be a favorite of mine.  

The wine list is small so we don&#39;t usually have very high expectations.  But, the servers will bring us a small taste, if its being served behind the bar, before we make our decision on what bottle we want.  By the time we&#39;re finished with the meal, we never have room for dessert.

On the weekends they have a singer who is a little loud, but at least he has a nice voice.  The patrons in the bar seem to like him.  The hang out and sometimes dance.  Not my scene, but its good that they have fun.

The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was inviting. The dinning room is a bit on the small side so I can see there being a longer wait during the more busy hours of the evening. The bar area is just as you enter the restaurant and has a rather loud singer in it. While I feel they are going for a romantic setting here I feel the singer was a bit on the distracting side. He also sang a bunch of Eagles songs... Italian music would have been more fitting. All in Alll the atmosphere here is very nice and more suited for a romantic dinner for two than a family. Our server was very friendly as well. For dinner I ordered the Margarita pizza. The pizza was very fresh and you can tell it is home made. My boyfriend ordered the Linguine with Clams and loved it. I couldn&#39;t believe he ate the whole bowel... He said it was that good.  For dessert we both had the terramissu. It was good but nothing special. Over all this is a nice restaurant and I would dine here again.

I ordered the spaghetti w/ meat sauce &amp; mozarella, my boyfriend ordered the ziti w/ peas &amp; sausage. Both arrived quickly. My dish was piping hot as if it had been placed in the microwave. the cheese was melted into the sauce &amp; made it very stringy &amp; the pasta clumpy. it so hot i could barely taste the sauce. after a couple of bites i decided to send it back, when i told the hostess i didn&#39;t know the cheese would be melted into the sauce her reply was &#34;yeah thats how the dish is&#34; in quite a snappy manor. She did not offer to replace it until I made it obvious i wasn&#39;t going to eat it. I ordered the Ziti which was very good.  

i may return, but will stick to a safe dish like the ziti and i hope we dont have to deal with the nasty hostess/waitress. I&#39;ve worked in restaurants for 12 years, and i would have never replied that way to a customer who was not satisfied with the food. You simply apologize and immediately offer to replace it. I was more disatisfied with the service than anything."

The waiter was polite but not personable.  He seemed to ask if we were ok or how was the food because he had to not because he wanted to.  The soup was good.  The main course was good but not great. We ate all of our food because we were very hungry.  I would not say that I fell in love with the food as their slogan suggests.  They also need to get bigger glasses because my husband had 5 glasses of coke.  I would probably not return.

This could have definitely deterred some potential customers! However, the interior was nicely decorated and our experience made up for our initial impression of the restaurant.

I ordered the suonomo and loco tako roll. The waitress was very sweet and also gave me a house salad and miso soup on the house. I loved how this house salad wasn&#39;t as drenched with dressing. The suonomo was an excellent appetizer and such a good deal! The loco tako roll was also excellent and fresh. This combination was very filling surprisingly. I was very satisfied upon leaving dinner.

Overall, service was superb and fish was very fresh and delicious. I tried the ramen and udon, which weren&#39;t as great as the sushi here, so I would stick with the fish!"

In a good size lot with plenty of parking.  Went here with my family.  We have been to their other location on Barrington Road as well.

This is a japanese restaurant with sushi as their specialty.  We&#39;ve had other dishes as well. Some of our favs and &#34;must order&#34; are appetizer dishes, believe it or not.  Highly recommend the fried soft shell crab.  One of my all time favs and I need to go back for!!  Our second favorite appetizer is the spicy shrimp tempura. (has mushrooms too.) The flavor is sweet and on point.  Always cooked to perfection!  These appetizers were $8 a piece.

They also have many variety of sushi.  One of my favorite is the Hell Roll. Pricing is under $15 for this roll.  The taste is always fresh, and on point.  Not only does it taste good, but appearance is beautiful as well.  Lots of specialty rolls, noodles, bento box, nigiri sushi, maki, etc.

We&#39;ve also had other dishes and rolls.  Such as Ramen, or pork Katsu don. All dishes under $15 bucks a piece.  

Overall, service is great here. I did notice the restaurant is not overcrowded or too busy.
You get alot of attention from the staff, definitely a plus in my book.  We ended our visit with a pineapple fruit slice.  Last thing I wanted to add, my baby, got a bowl of white rice and miso soup.  He enjoyed the tofu in it!!

Would recommend this place and definitely going back for that soft shell crab!!

p.s.  When I was pregnant, i had a craving for mussels.  This place had the best mussel dish.  However, they have taken it off their menu.  Please bring it back!!"

Anyone who rates less must&#39;ve come in on the wrong day or something. The ramen is so good! It rivals some of the best ones we&#39;ve eaten in Japan. The mountain roll - hands down the simplest roll but worth the drive. Baked so it&#39;s warm and drenched in this sauce that you can&#39;t stop eating it once you have the first bite! We were at the bar, and they offered us a free crab ragoon as a starter. The value is worth it, lots of food I left stuffed! Crab ragoon, Soup, salad, ramen, mountain roll, philly roll, and gyoza for 30 bucks. Not a bad date night :-) the sushi chef was great to chat with and the host/ server she was sweet and accommodating! I will make it back here again!!"

I feel like Minami is really REALLY reasonably priced for what they give you. Their lunch specials are a steal. For $10 you can get 2 sushi rolls of your choice (from a selected menu). salad, and soup. Ok so you can&#39;t order some crazy concoction, but the selection of rolls are great for that cheap. And the quality is still there. Seriously, you can&#39;t complain. If you don&#39;t like sushi they definitely have other choice to choose from. 

The service is great, they are very nice and accommodating. It was very quiet for a Saturday afternoon, which scares me because I love this place. So come here."

We were seated immediately and I can hardly recall ever receiving quicker or more attentive service.  The miso soup was good, and we really liked the sushi.  The rice had a good flavor and was of the right consistency, the fish was fresh, and I really, REALLY loved the ponzu sauce on the summer rolls.  We also had eel and avocado rolls and tempura dragon rolls.  All were delicious.  The complimentary half-orange at the end of the meal made for a nice palate cleanser.

The ambiance was pleasant and charming, with paper lanterns, bamboo stalks, and fairy lights all laid out in a classy way, not a gaudy one.  The second half of the restaurant seems like it was partitioned off for private parties, and I noticed a stage at the front.  Not sure if that is just for the private events to use or if other entertainment is intended.

The bottom line: the food was good, the service was excellent, and the prices were decent - not cheap, but reasonable.  We will be back."

I had the pork ramen set with 3pc nigiri. Ramen was delicious; broth was flavorful but not the rich &#34;milky&#34; kind. I personally liked the ginger in the soup. It could be overwhelming for those who don&#39;t care too much for ginger, as there was quite an amount of shredded ones (pickled and fresh). Nigiri was good enough: shrimp and salmon pieces were fresh, the tuna one was just okay. I&#39;d definitely go back, and will also try their other location."

When we first stepped in we noticed it reeked of fried food/old oil. After entering we had to wait a little bit to be acknowledged then waited for a minute for a table to get bussed, then we were seated. It seemed like there was one server running around with her head chopped off. Shortly after our drinks were served we were ready to order, but had to wait for the only server to become available. She takes our order of 3 items mentally. Soup is served after at least 15 minutes, then a salad comes out maybe 8 minutes later. Shortly after finishing the salad another server/busser appears and clears the dishes off our table (this person is more relaxed compared to the first server who took our order). This place should have their servers in uniform or dressed a little more professionally. Music playing for ambiance was R&amp;B and personally I would have preferred something more ethnic. Waited and waited for food to arrived, by now we&#39;ve been waiting at least a good 45 minutes. Still waiting we decided to finally ask the &#39;more relaxed&#39; busser/server if our food was about ready. She goes to ask the chef and returns to inform us it&#39;s being worked on. She brings the first dish two minutes later. And brought out our remaining two dishes as it was ready. Food was good. Hard to really enjoy when you&#39;re so annoyed at the wait I guess. Our server never acknowledged our food being late but the other server/busser did apologize. After finishing our server literally drops the check on the table vs placing it on the table. When walking out the chef also apologized about the wait. 
First and last time here. At home now and we all reek of the fried smell."

The broth was perfectly seasoned (which might mean it&#39;s salty for people with normal taste buds), the tripe/brisket/tendon were great, and the bean sprouts/basil/cilantro were fresh. The only thing I would say is that it&#39;s a bit lacking in the amount of meat they put in. Maybe it&#39;s because the bowl that the pho comes in is humongous but I think with the amount of noodles and broth that came in the bowl, they could have offset it with a bit more meat. 

The place seems pretty authentic since the workers were Vietnamese and the decor of the restaurant definitely looked like it as well which doesn&#39;t matter to me because I prefer authentic delicious food over tablecloths and candlelight. At least the bathrooms were clean.

Overall a great place to grab a quick and tasty bowl of pho. Grab one of their coffee candies on the way out!"

But it was significantly smaller today.

They have an extensive menu and while we&#39;ve tried their other food (including egg rolls, rice and noodle plates), I just recommend the #8 pho,

The restaurant itself is wheelchair accessible, but it gets packed during dinner time. I haven&#39;t tried their restroom. 

You can order online through their website via https://www.beyondmenu.com. It didn&#39;t work from my sister&#39;s iPhone 4, but I had no problem ordering online from my laptop on Chrome. You need to create an account. You can pay at the restaurant or online with a credit card. I would NOT recommend ordering online; had to wait 30 mins once we got there for the take out. There&#39;s no way to indicate how fast you want your food ordering online.

They deliver, but we haven&#39;t tried that yet.

I wish they were open Mondays.

Spring Rolls were very good IMO. Great wrapper, pork roll, shrimp, &amp; rice noodles. Far better than the last 4 times I have ordered these at other Thai spots... and $4 is a bargain!

Egg Rolls were also very good. Mostly pork and not a lot of filler. Satisfied.

The Bánh mì was ok. I like the ingredients but the bread is sub par. They could use a bit more meat. Eat it fast while it&#39;s warm...

The Pho was ok. The broth was very mild so we added other things to give it some flavor. The round &amp; flank steak were good but there&#39;s not a lot in there. 

We live close so will be back but it&#39;s not a destination spot. The service was poor, waitress knows almost nothing about the actual dishes, no water refills unless you ask because she&#39;s watching tv.... Would be helpful to learn what you serve the customers who are going to tip you, maybe it was her first day...She was polite though if that makes a difference...
=============================================================

Stopped in again, service was a bit better this time. Had the Spicy Chicken &amp; Basil, veggies were nice and crunchy and the flavor was good. Tried the grilled pork Bánh mì, these need a bit more meat... Also did Chicken Pad Thai, A little to much fish sauce for my liking but I am sure you could ask them to use a bit less. The chicken was overcooked so dry &amp; chewy.  Seems they cook a lot of things to the well done stage. Odd as the vegetables I&#39;ve had are perfectly cooked."

We got Pho Tai, and it was delicious. They also had chili oil, which we prefer, to add to the Pho for a little kick instead of just Sriracha. They also had free wi-fi (the password was on a post-it on each of the tables).

Our only complaint was that the service seemed a little lacking. We got one refill on our water when we got our food, but definitely could have used more throughout the meal. And we often saw the staff sitting at table on the other side of the restaurant watching tv shows/YouTube, rather loudly, on their tablets.

However, don&#39;t let the look decieve you as the food here is similiar in quality to larger, better known competitors.

I went here on opening day,which was very busy. Surprisingly, they still managed to provide friendly service and seat patrons / clear tables at a reasonable speed. I would have preferred a larger menu, but given the size of the restaurant (and kitchen), it&#39;s understandable why they&#39;d stick to the main items you&#39;d expect from a Vietnamese restaurant. The prices are reasonable, portion sizes standard, and food in general isn&#39;t too oily or salty.

Here were my thoughts on some items:

Egg roll: The pork within provides a nice meaty flavor, stuffed with noodles, mushrooms, and other various items with minimal vegetables. Tasty and filling.

Vietnamese Coffee: Robust and flavorful. Don&#39;t be fooled by the smaller quantity of coffee as the flavor is definitely intense.

Com Tam Son Ha: Pork chop was tender, fatty, and flavorful with a nice char. Good thickness instead of the thin cut you&#39;ll find at most places. The rice is very nice and fluffy and great when you mix it with the fried egg.

Pho Son Ha: An alright pho. Broth is sweet and light, would&#39;ve preferred a stronger meat flavor however. Noodles were plentiful but lacked a nice bouncy texture. The meats were okay, would&#39;ve preferred a fattier cut (ribeye instead of eye round steak) for the rare beef but the tendon was prepared nicely. Comes with plenty of bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime, and basil.

Shrimp fried rice: Comes with split pieces of larger shrimp. The fried rice itself is surprising as it&#39;s very fluffy instead of dry. The egg flavor really comes out and isn&#39;t masked by soy sauce. Has a good amount of wok hay / umami and is generally a nice aromatic dish. 

Massaman Curry: Very spicy compared to most other local Thai places although not really that spicy if compared to other types of curry. Rich flavorful broth with a strong coconut and onion flavor. The roasted peanuts and potato provide a nice texture contrast here and the chicken was not overcooked (my biggest complaint at most thai restaurants). 

Bún Tht Nng: Noodles are nice and bouncy, but the dish itself is pretty plain (mostly noodles, lettuce, and some meat) -- would&#39;ve liked to see some additional elements to provide variety.

Overall, small restaurant but surprisingly the dishes were well planned and executed."

The pho broth is notably lacking in the beautiful aromas that you&#39;ll find in most phos. You can add a little Sriracha to give it a little zing, but this is just by way of trying to correct for what is lacking. 

Bad? No, but just a pale comparison to other, better places a few miles away. If this has been my only experience with pho, I would never have learned to love it."

Pho broth was full of flavor, they must take their time in preparing it because it tastes like a lot of work went into it.  The Pho also comes with all the spices to modify it to your liking.  I like this because I can make it as spicy as I&#39;m in the mood for.

We walked into to an empty restaurant and all of the employees and their children sitting around a table chatting. Not the most professional atmosphere, but it did feel homey. All of the employees were very nice. We got a complimentary decent-sized pot of hot tea. 

We ordered egg rolls, pho, and shrimp fried rice. 

Egg rolls: these came out after the pho and the fried rice. Rookie mistake. Not only that, but they were also cold. I asked them to reheat them and they came out again about 30 seconds later, a little warmer, but bland and hard. 
Pho: the broth had a really weird SWEET flavor to it. Is pho supposed to be sweet? Am I missing something? Also there was barely any meat in it. My elderly grandma liked it though so here&#39;s a star for that. 
Shrimp fried rice: About four pieces of shrimp and a really fishy flavor.

It just so happened that it was their first day open so it was a bit of a hurried bustle. Lots of people came in for delicious food, so that was a good sign. 

They took about 30 minutes to get me my pho and veg fried rice and only accepted cash since their register was out of order (there&#39;s an ATM in the liquor store at the end of the strip mall).

The pho came in different containers (as it should) with several twigs worth of beautifully fragrant basil, onions, sprouts, veggies and of course the meat (uncooked of course). Once you pour all the ingredients together, they all cook and blend amazingly. It was such a fresh and delicious soup that really hit the spot on a cold day. The vegetable fried rice was tasty but not quite where I expected it to be.

I was delighted with my pho and would definitely order here again, just keeping in mind I shouldn&#39;t be in any type of hurry.

I really like Masaman curry, BUT this was one of the worst first visits I have ever had to a new restaurant (open 8 weeks) that I can remember. I plan on forgetting this one too.

I asked for spicy and got low spices. NO hint of coconut and I specifically asked WHERE are the peanuts and was told &#34;they make it with peanuts&#34;. NO hint of  those peanuts when my meal was over or the subtle rich Masaman flavors that even 5 spice will help you develop in a basic curry.  No roasted peanuts and half my boiled potatoes were turning black and I don&#39;t mean just on the edges.  I thought they might be radishes which I could maybe understand. Nope, spoiling potatoes, incorrectly stored or mishandled at best. ICK; not trimming that is a REALLY bad sign.

Chicken was sparse but not overcooked. Rice low grade, I think all the ingredients were poor quality. I don&#39;t doubt Sherwin&#39;s better visit, but I am warning you OFF this place for now. On the other hand, a few of my friends point out that Pho Son Ha is still the best Vietnamese joint in that particular strip, a lot better than the odorous nail joint next door. And I agree so I&#39;m going up a star. Still, if you think this is ok then YOU can make your own curries. Ask teh Google.

My Vietnamese wouldn&#39;t have really helped me here. The only Vietnamese I know is &#34;where can I buy a book of receipts?&#34;, and &#34;how old are you really?&#34;. However your Spanglish WILL serve you here. My server, who obviously could have cared less, pretended to not understand my question about whether boiled potatoes were supposed to be half black, I should have switched to Spanish.

I think is the best pho I ever ate in my past. if you like Vietnamese foods, come and Check it out. 

I had ate couple Vietnamese in the past and they all really bad. I never come back after I ate at those place. This place is PHO SON HA is way better than those. no kidding! Give it a try if u don&#39;t believe me."

I&#39;m a huge Pho fan and this place has the most consistent soup. The broth is a perfect balance, not too salty and minimally fat. The choice of beef, tendon or flank is a winner no matter what combination. The sprouts and basil always fresh.

I&#39;m a bit reluctant to share this find since they&#39;re not always busy and I appreciate the great service due to that. Nevertheless, I want them to do well and stay in business. When it does get crowded, you need to be patient. I noted that it is getting better more recently"

Not only did they forget to bring out our spring rolls, but when the lady working the register tried to give us a free order, instead of just taking the $4 off of our bill, the male (who I am guessing is the owner) all but accused us of eating our spring rolls and pretending we didn&#39;t get them so we wouldn&#39;t be charged. It got to the point where it was starting to get uncomfortable.

Seriously?

If the pho was delicious enough to make me overlook this, that&#39;d be one thing. But it was not.

I had the chicken Pho and spring rolls. The spring rolls were good...shrimp was fresh.  

The owner is a very nice man and seems to really care about his customers.  I hope this place makes it because there are very few Pho restaurants in the suburbs.  

I&#39;ve had chicken pho at many places and often in big cities during travel. The best I&#39;ve had includes all white meat chicken breast.  This chicken was not high quality (mostly brown meat) and had the skin still on it, which I&#39;ve never seen before...kind of gross. There were also bones in the meat. 

The broth, however, was delicious and the best I&#39;ve ever had. I hope the owner reads these comments and decides to upgrade to a better cut of meat because the prices are pretty high and I&#39;d expect better."

Had a restaurant.com certificate and was recommended by a friend.  We ordered the pork chop and pho and both were very good.  Only problem was the lack of service despite the fact we went late in the afternoon when it wasn&#39;t very crowded - service consisted of taking order and delivering the food and bill handling - never checked on us to see if we needed anything or how it tasted.  We had to also ask for the bill long after we were done.  Hope they can improve on service and marketing to draw customers into the strip mall as the food was good and always nice to support family-owned small businesses.

 Some family, friends, and yours truly were out drowning our sorrows with libations when we finally made it to Neoteca for a late dinner. This higher end pizza and wine joint sits high on a corner lot with ample out door seating to soak up beautiful weather. Inside is modern yet comfortable and we all naturally gravitated to the bar. Bartender was way knowledgeable and quick for suggestions. They are known for their extensive wine offerings, but their beer list was spot on as well. And how can I ever pass up the opportunity for pizza and beer right? Right. Pizzas are not huge so order accordingly, they are more the hand tossed, artisan style. Flavorful and fresh with cool toppings available. Apps were pretty fun too. 
Neoteca would make a great date spot, catching up with friends, or just for eating most of your sisters pizza because you wolfed yours down too quickly to help soak up the booze from the previously visited establishments. Either way, I&#39;ll be back."

The drinks are strong! Expensive, but you only need one. My kind of place. They have a cheese a meat tray that you can customize, which is cool. They have great pizzas, pastas, desserts, and a few other menu items. The menu isn&#39;t huge, but the food is authentic and tasty. Not the cheapest place, but worth the price.

We didn&#39;t try the wines, but it seems like they have a nice selection. Our waiter was very good at first, but ended up taking forever to bring our checks later on. Overall, a very good place to stop in Barrington."

Upon arrival we asked to sit out in the patio. Patio was nice, softer lights would have been nicer. 
Server was on her way to another table and said she would be right with us. 
She came back and said, &#39;what am I getting you?&#39; Not a hello, not a here are our specials, may I recommend anything?
We waited for the drinks and had decided on the food, but did wonder about the pasta of the day. 
When we asked her she looked confused, and then said, &#39;oh yea, I forgot&#39; and had to look in her notes. 
My husband and I ordered meatballs, captures salad,&#39;prosciutto pizza and gnocchi. 
Meatballs- cold and just ok
Caprese salad- decent, but would have been nice to be offered cracked pepper like our neighboring table.
Gnocchi- fantastic. Light and fluffy. Just needed a bit more salt
Pizza- fabulous

All in all, would have been a much better experience if the server had made us feel like it mattered that we were sitting there. Her tip definitely reflected her attitude towards us. 

We will probably try Neoteca again..... just because we really enjoyed the pizza.  But, hopefully servers are trained better."

The interior is very trendy, mostly modern dark decor complimented by pops of color through its artworks and lighting. It&#39;s beautiful, they brought Chicago downtown to Barrington&#39;s downtown. I also love that they have a wine vault and a brick pizza oven.

The night started off rocky and frustrating, after being seated on the patio by the bartender... 25 minutes pass and not a single person came to our table to take our drink/food order or even drop off glasses of water. I felt invisible. There were only 5 parties dinning that evening with 3 waiters staffed. We were seated in plain sight, I made eye contact with 2 different waitresses and I saw one watching the tv at some point. There was no reasonable explanation as to why no one would approached our table or even checked in to see if we&#39;ve been helped. I made it painfully obvious that we were looking for a waitress. Needless to say we were very frustrated with the situation. My bf ended up having to go inside to address this. They were very apologetic and we honestly would&#39;ve left to another restaurant but it was already late in the evening and we were hungry! 

The manager, Nick ended up serving us. Let me just take a moment to acknowledge and appreciate him, he really saved the night and our dinning experience! He was super nice, friendly, and well informed. He went above and beyond!

Now to the good stuff: food and drinks! Spoiler alert, it did not disappoint. 

DRINKS: I loved how the beers and craft cocktails came out in frosted and chilled glasses - yuuum! The cocktails were pretty good, I ordered the Elderflower Spritz and the Limoncello. I look forward to trying other cocktails next time. Despite being a wine bar, I did not any wine options on the menu, maybe there was a separate wine menu that they did not give us.

FOOD: We defiantly ordered the whole menu, like I said we were hungry! 

The bruschettas were delicious, they have an assortment of options, we chose eggplant, artichoke and traditional. All 3 are worth a try! 

We also ordered a cheese platter with a side of zucchini and veggies, I liked that they have a decent selection of salami and cheeses to compliment your wine. The standout cheeses for us were the white cheddar and truffle cheese!  

Arrancini balls were just okay nothing memorable or outstanding. I wouldn&#39;t order it again.

The Bianca was amazing!! I love a good brick oven pizza and I&#39;m glad we found a good one close to home! We were able to add grilled onions and spinach to it, yum! 

Gnocchi marinara, was also just okay. Very basic ingredients.  

We look forward to coming back!"

Unfortunately for our party of 6, we all had a bad experience at neoTeca. Our waitress was horrible.

Additionally, the food was average(ordered bruschetta appetizer(s) and several pizzas), noise level was extremely LOUD, and a meal that should have been 1.5 hours turned into a 2.5 dinner(slow service).

However, we decided to reserve our judgement until we returned again because we know that there are always kinks to work out.  Well, we came back again last night and was really hoping for a better experience.  

The Good: 
The wine, bruschetta  (bacon burrata, shrimp pesto, ricotta honey) and Polpetti veggie balls were very tasty. Polpetti could&#39;ve been warmer though. 

The Disappointing:
We&#39;ve tried three different pizzas.  All three were bland and very skimpy on toppings.  The Margherita pizza had MAYBE three pieces of basil, hardly any fresh mozzarella and was very dry.  The Pomodoro Pizza was also dry and bland.  I used sauce from the Polpetti the try to help it.  My 12 yr old son ordered the Cheese Ravioli.  It was flat with almost no cheese inside.  He wouldn&#39;t even finish it though he was still hungry. The Caesar Salad was very bland and lacking flavor as well.  

Both times we dined here, we had to ask for plates and silverware...and there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table.  In addition, both servers we very slow and disappeared on us.  I also found it strange that, in order to refill water, they had to take our glasses rather than bring an ice pitcher to refill.

There are no children&#39;s menus or the option for just a plain Cheese Pizza.  I asked both times if they could just make it for my son and was told &#34;No, we only have Fresh Mozzarella so you should just order the Margherita&#34;.  I don&#39;t understand how a pizza place (no matter how trendy it is) doesn&#39;t have shredded mozzarella to make a regular cheese pizza to appeal to kids.  This just seems like a no brainer in a very kid-oriented town.  

Definitely no plans to return here in the future unless we are only eating the bruschetta or  Polpetti veggie balls.

You know it&#39;s not a good experience when your child asks you not to go back."

We are the fans!` I  saw people complaining about the pizza but the pizza is awesome . we tried several of them and all were good, especially Prosciutto Crudo one. They use imported ingredients and prosciutto was so far one of the best ones we have tried. If you expect pizza loaded lavishly with ingredients and with thousands of calories, go to Morettis. The service is very nice and yes it was slow on times but you can see there are a lot of people learning and it will definitely go better with time. The place is new so few things will need to be shaved to perfection. Their bruschetta is delicious and there are quite a few varieties to try, hot or cold. We especially liked smoked salmon one with persian feta--so good. The place play nice music and is usually packed on Fridays and Saturdays, much slower on Sundays. Martin The Bartender makes very good drinks and Neoteca offers wide selection of wines. It is very convenient that they have `quater` wine which is equivalent of 2 glasses. We will be visiting frequently. Their pizza is worth coming back :)"

There are usually kinks that need to be ironed out. However, I had such a wonderful experience last night and I need to give Neoteca 
their props!! 
My husband ordered the Spicy SoppresSata pizza. The flavor was SO delicious ( I tried 1 bite) He said it wasn&#39;t too heavy and filling. Which seems like a oxymoron to me!
I ordered the Bruschetta Bar. I wasn&#39;t eating bread so they offered lettuce instead. 
I had the Portobello Mushroom bruschetta, Eggplant bruschetta and Pesto Shrimp bruschetta. WOW I loved it! 
Now the dessert!! OMG, we had the vanilla gelato with a shot of espresso poured on top. 
We love our espresso and can&#39;t believe we have never had this or done it at home with our espresso machine. I could never go there without ending my meal with this dessert!
I can&#39;t end without acknowledging the service. It was so pleasant. Our waitress was very  helpful, explaining the menu, always making sure we had what we needed, and just pleasant and friendly! I wish I could remember her name (I&#39;ll update this later, she deserves Kudos) 
I let the management ( Steve) know what a wonderful experience we had at their restaurant and what a great addition it is to the community. 
We are looking forward to trying everything on the menu."

Our experience on this day however was like none other.  It was almost like management went into the back and handcrafted a server just for us.  Her name is Susanne and she was simply AMAZING!  We went with all of her recommendations starting with the scallop skewers.  I mean, what can be said about ANYTHING wrapped in bacon? YUM.  Just enough for my love and I to share.  She then began to go over the specials.  I even asked her to repeat them a few times because I couldn&#39;t believe what my ears were hearing. Fire grilled Cod over Brussel Sprouts?!?!?!?! SCORE!!!!!!!!!  Free your mind and try this.  You will not be disappointed.
As the evening came to a close our amazing server presented us with a flourless chocolate cake.  OMG!!!!!!!! Another YUM!
Thanks Wildfire and a very special thanks to Susanne."

The waitress my friends and I had last time we were in was seriously adorable. Us ladies had lots to celebrate at this dinner - our friend home visiting, two pregnancies, and a bride to be - and it was the perfect place to get together.

The bread they serve is really good! I know that&#39;s kind of lame to mention but you gotta appreciate a delicious complimentary loaf of bread and butter, am I right?

The Wildfire chopped salad was listed as a fan favorite on the menu and I must say, I&#39;m still craving this delicious concoction. It&#39;s a perfect entree for the summer, but boy is it huge! They offer the salad in a small or large size. I went with the small and honestly even that size is a shareable option (especially considering this doesn&#39;t really keep well as leftovers). I wonder how large the large is!?

Filled with roasted chicken, avocado, tomatoes, blue cheese, bacon, scallions, corn, tortilla strips and tossed with a citrus lime vinaigrette, this salad is a win in my opinion. Plus, a small is only $14.95 and like I said, it&#39;s ginormous. I got a cup of the French onion soup to go with it and it was really well done.

The restaurant itself is pretty large and has a nice bar menu. Wildfire IMO is a great place to go with a group as they offer a menu with lots of options and have plenty of seating!"

When we walked in there were a lot of empty tables. The ambiance was great, really liked the decor. It has a very classy old fashion feel to it.

I ordered the Coconut Shrimp and Teriyaki Tuna Steak, the shrimp was alright, I have had better. but the tuna steak was really good, it was cooked to perfection and the teriyaki sauce gave it a great flavor. only negative was that the portion was small. for dessert we had a  slice of Triple Layer Chocolate cake. 

The thing that was the most annoying was that the service was a little slow. you would assume that when there are many empty tables meaning that service should be fast, not the case."

We&#39;ve also held work parties , family parties , and funeral luncheons  here . Everything is always exceptional . The shrimp and lobster bisque is to die for !! It is worth a trip here for that alone . They have a nice wine and alcohol selection as well . My favorite meal is petite filet mignon with a side of balsamic roasted vegetables . It hits the spot every  time !

I must make a special note that we held my brothers funeral luncheon here . We had a preselected lunch and private room . It was the first meal I ate for days since my brother died , and was the first thing to make me feel a little better . Everyone commented on how exceptional the food was . Just sad he wasn&#39;t there to share it with me ..

This is a &#34;Lettuce Entertain You &#34; restaurant , meaning it goes above and beyond . I&#39;ve been here 20-30 times at least , and only once had a snubby waitress .

The place has a nice old school vibe to it, with low lit lighting.  It gave me that laid back, relaxing vibe right away.  We settle into a booth in the &#39;martini bar&#39; area and were on our way.

Our server Thomas was extremely pleasant, friendly, knowledgable and willing to answer all questions.  We were initially presented with lunch menus since it was just after 3pm, but after asking for a wine list and dinner menus, he informed us that the dinner specials would be ready at 3:30pm if we wanted to wait.

The menu is pretty robust but it&#39;s main focus is red meat.  A decent amount of steaks to choose from.  Many different cuts of beef, portion sizes and rubs/crusts/sauces.  They also have plenty of burgers, salads, sandwiches and a few pizzas.  

I opted for a medium rare Bison filet and it was cooked perfectly!  The better half went with a pizza and enjoyed it tremendously.  All the foods were cooks as we liked, tasted phenomenal  and since we had just run a marathon, nothing was left.  I call that a win.

They have a really nice full service bar. Plenty of current and classic cocktails are waiting for you.  The wine list is decent.  There are a significant amount of wines by the glass, both red, white and sparkling available.  The wine list is neatly organized by type.  They have plenty of affordable options by the bottle and a &#39;cellar&#39; selection with pricier wines.  The cellar selection focuses mostly on California wines.

Overall this place is a really nice stop for Schaumburg.  I would easily go back for cocktails or to eat."

So I didn&#39;t think they could improve but they did! They have apparently made their ribeye, which was already juicy, tender, and flavorful with a nice light char on the outside, even better.  It literally melted in my mouth and I closed my eyes in pure joy.  

The creamed spinach is still great and the roasted veggies were pretty good too, though not really my thing but they all had a nice flavor to them.  Nicely golden brown and crisp.

Service is excellent, very attentive and just so good at making sure we had everything we needed and even asked if we wanted stuff that we didn&#39;t think about. A wonderful experience. 

Make sure to make a reservation online, it cuts your wait time to about 15 minutes."

This would be the venue for our team dinner... A large well rated restaurant located in Schaumburg, Il. Nicely decorated looking every bit the part of a fine steakhouse with dark woods and high ceilings... I&#39;m usually not a big fan of chain restaurants unless they&#39;re upper high-end but let me tell you... This place was awesome!

Great friendly snd attentive staff that catered to our every whim... Wonderful appetizers right thru our dinner and dessert!

For starters we nibbled on their meatballs in marinara with melted parm... Savory with a nice consistency... In addition to that we had the artichoke dip with crackers... Again..., well executed...

The filet- grilled medium, roaster chicken with steamed lemon broccoli was served family style and was extremely good... A quality cut of beef without so much as an ounce of grizzle served in a wonderful au jus! The potatoes... A mix of baked topped with a blend of whipped twice baked were a perfect accompaniment to our mean.

For dessert... Apple crumb pie and a rich chocolate cake... Add to that my signature cappuccino and life is truly complete!

Thanks for a great experience!... Il be back..."

Wildfire unfortunately is going downhill. I had the fish sandwich the other week which was soso and today a Turkey Ruben. The sandwiches here used to be pretty good (Remember the Mustard Crusted Chicken) but now seem lackluster. The fish sandwich has more bun and stuff than fish (the relish is good) and the TR was basically sliced turkey and coleslaw. Really!!! dumping your already made coleslaw on turkey makes it a ruben?! Seriously... SAD!

The surroundings are reminiscent of a 1920s supper club.  The leafy-print curtains made for a pretty backdrop to many photos.  If you&#39;re looking for a private party room, and something a little different than the tried (and tired) family-style Italian options, Wildfire also has a family style menu.

The tomato mozzarella pizza was delicious, but you can&#39;t really go wrong with bread and cheese.  The chopped salad was fantastic!  I rarely go back for seconds on a salad, but the ingredients were so tasty that I couldn&#39;t help myself.  The lemon pepper chicken was dry, but the prime rib was excellent.  I found a piece that wasn&#39;t shocking pink, which made me happy :)

The best part was, of course, dessert!  The portions were enormous, we each got a generously sized peanut butter chocolate ice cream sandwich (my favorite part of the ENTIRE meal) and traditional cheesecake.

It was a little bit hard to track someone down to ask for a drink, but other times they were right on everyone&#39;s heels with a glass of punch.  Overall, this was an enjoyable experience."

You cannot go wrong with my ultimate favorite alcoholic drink of all time: Stormy Night Martini. I mean fabbbullouuusss. Tart and fruity just the way I like it! Don&#39;t get it twisted, more than 1 WILL sneak up on you! 

The service is always great! My favorite waiter is Edgar. Super friendly outgoing guy and never judgey for the obscene amounts of bread and martinis requested. Yes, we keep it classy Chicagoland. 

Food is spectacular. Chopped salad-yas. Ribs-yasssssssss. Salmon-oh yeah. Lobster and filet-YAAAAAsSSSsss. 
Needless to say the lobster and filet is my favorite! I like my meat from medium to medium-well and it&#39;s always cooked the way I ask. It&#39;s not al la carte which I like you always have a choice of at least 1 side without extra cost. 

The ribs are a second favorite of mine. Super succulent, perfectly juicy meat that falls right off the bone with hardly any fat type of deal. Don&#39;t even get me started on the sauce; It&#39;s serious. 

Oh, and If you&#39;re a fan of medallions-this is the place to go! However be aware they are LIMITED and have ran out twice on my friends already. For those bad boys: GET HERE EARLY. 

The ambiance is superb. Super classy old-fashioned 1920s ish vibe-love love love. Perfect for date night or a night out with the girls!"

Party of 4 started off with a chopped salad for the table. I usually think appetizer salads are a dime a dozen with not too many flavor profiles  (after all, isn&#39;t is always the leafy greens + some condiments &amp; dressing?), so was just trying to be agreeable &amp; non- super high maintenance sounding when I agreed to this &#34;fabulous chopped salad for 4.&#34; I still didn&#39;t expect too much after it was served... The salad was very colorful, and shockingly quite tasty! If anything, I think it would be better without the tortilla strips  (it gets a little soggy &amp; just kind of ruins the rest of the yummyness for me). 

I had the bison filet with coffee rub (was feeling adventurous) - one word: AWESOMENESS. I also tried others&#39; ribeye and filet medallions, which were a very tasty! For dessert I had the banana coconut creme pie. If I wasn&#39;t half stuffed from everything else prior to that, I would&#39;ve strongly considered taking a whole pie to go. The pie was fabulous, served with banana slices on the side to make it more healthy! 

The biggest disappointment for me that night was the cocktail. I got a berry cherry mojito, which kinda resembled a watered down adult Shirley Temple (mint leaves were pretty absent, &amp; not a lot of alcohol)... I guess I can play it safe &amp; order some red wine next time."

I&#39;ve been here before, but it&#39;s been a while and I&#39;ve never reviewed (even though I love it here).

Two words : CHOPPED SALAD

Always always always get it. It&#39;s the best salad ever. Chicken, fresh tortilla strips, avocado, tomatoes, blue cheese, amazing dressing. Highly recommend this!

Ok so I&#39;ve tried to eat lamb many times and I&#39;ve never liked it much because it has this gamey taste that I just can&#39;t get past.... but... I ordered this here. Just decided to give it another shot. OMG. So good. I ordered it medium rare, of course! I think they might have converted me into a lamb lover. It was the best lamb I&#39;ve ever had. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and it came with a mint chimichurri that complemented it very well. I think I found my favorite dish here. If you&#39;re a lamb lover, or even if you&#39;re not, I recommend this!

My side was mac and cheese. It was really good. They bake it in the oven so it comes hot and gooey. Just yum!

I tried the creamed spinach. It was really good. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like it, but it was nice. Mild creamy flavor with a hint of spinach.

My mom got the full slab of ribs. It looked like a generous portion and big and meaty, but once you got into it, there was barely any meat on the bones. It was a disappointment... the meat was tender, just wasn&#39;t a lot of it. For the price, not worth it. I tried the mushroom side and it was really salty. Didn&#39;t taste as good as I expected.

I enjoyed my experience here, as I always do. The servers were really accommodating and the food was good. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back soon :)"

Dios  mío , I&#39;m such a procrastinator.  We went for diner at the Wildfire three weeks ago and I&#39;m just now writing the review.  Probably because it has taken that long for me to digest my steak Jaaaa. 

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the steak was great, but more than I could eat. 
I ordered the Porterhouse steak with two cuts.  Hmmmm , deliciosa. 
I had carrots as a side.  The steak was big and the steak was thick, no complaints ... Except... Maybe a little extra au jus on the side next time because I ran out.  The side of carrots was also plentiful. 

The service was good, the food was good , the place was crowded because we were there at dinner time. It was also somewhat loud with the many conversations all around us.  We were a party of five. The girls ordered the petit filet , the boyz ordered the steak , and the kid had the hamburger. The natural order of things.  All was well in my universe. The prices were reasonable for the amount of food consumed. 

My only real regret of the evening was that my guest was celebrating a birthday and as this was my first time at the Wildfire and I was busy taking in the sights I completely forgot to inform the wait staff of the desire for a birthday surprise desert. Oh well, there is always next year as my guest informed me that this was her favorite &#34;night out&#34; place. 
Next time however , I will be better prepared and fast the day before so that I will be able to accommodate that thick Porterhouse ! Whew ! 
What a work out ... I needed two forks"

We started off with the fried calamari. You know when the calamari is good when you dip it in the sauce and it does break apart on you. And obviously the most important entree...the rib eye. Ordered it wth a side of mashed potatoes and rib eye came jammed pack with flavors and very juicy. I ordered it medium rare and got a medium rare. Would definitely come back."

My boyfriend and I did the martini flight...which is a fun way to try different martinis! All of our food was perfectly prepared and delicious. Our grandma ordered a baked potato with her entree and I swear it was as big as my face! We didn&#39;t stop there, because how can you when they bring around a tray of desserts!?

Checked in and got seated right away. Was celebrating my moms birthday and the restaurant accommodated our request for a booth! 
Our server was Lana and she made our night celebrating enjoyable and made our dining experience just amazing!
If you like martinis like I do, you have to order the Signature Martini Flight. You get mini versions of their most popular martinis - cosmo, green apple, wild raspberry cosmo, and stormy night (black cherry with watermelon pucker). Our waitress let us know that if we didn&#39;t like one of them, you could get two green apple or two cosmos and so on. Good to know!
I got the ribeye filet &#34;diane style&#34; on the specials menu with au gratin potatoes as my side. Steak was cooked, medium, perfectly! Potatoes had just the right amount of cheese. The ribeye steak came with mushrooms and crispy onions with the sauce which made the flavors mix so well together!
When ordering desserts, they bring you out a dessert tray so you can see everything in person while your server explains each item. Portions are huge and great for sharing. We ordered the apple streusel pie and the peach blueberry pie. In occasion of it being my moms birthday, she chose the chocolate lava cake as her birthday dessert on the house. All desserts we ordered were served with ice cream and we couldn&#39;t stop eating them!

This restaurant always offers good foods in a generous portion.  And the quality of the foods and the service have been rather consistently good throughout my frequent visits.

I&#39;ve had some steaks and fishes as main dishes; and they have all been decent, if not fantastic.  Appetizers and desserts are perhaps more delicious and a tad bit more interesting than the main dishes.  The salads are good, too; and their portion is quite large.

I&#39;ve been generally satisfied with this establishment; it is one of the better restaurants in Schaumburg.  Then, why not five stars and only four stars?  Well, you will find that all the items on their menu are familiar ones, albeit in a good quality; there seems to be no house specialty or creative dishes exclusive to this restaurant only.  That is why I only give four stars; perhaps four and a half stars."

The baby back ribs were super tough my husband can&#39;t even pull them apart and he&#39;s a body builder. The manager agreed their baby back ribs is hard, too when she came out the talk to use nicely.
He ordered a well done fillet mignon after finding out he can&#39;t eat the baby back ribs. However about 1/6 of the fillet was scorched and you can hear the coal cutting kind of sound when cutting through the scorched part.
My brother found tip of a paper napkin in his pork chops in the mushroom and potatoes portion and almost ate it if he hadn&#39;t spit it out.

It&#39;s bad for some occasions that you don&#39;t want to complain about food like your first date. Otherwise the waiter said it doesn&#39;t happened that often and I hope so, too."

Five Stars on the martini and wine flights. Both excellent.

The peppercorn crusted strip was delicious, as was the peppercorn sauce. 5 Stars.

The beet salad with goat cheese and greens was a disappointment. A beet salad should have lots of beets. Not this one. Maybe four or five  small bites, way lots of greens and a light dust of goat cheese. The dressing was very good. The salad a disappointment.

Ordered a baked potato. The texture was all wrong. I&#39;m thinking it was yesterday&#39;s. Or over-baked.

I didn&#39;t address my disappointments because I was someone&#39;s guest. But probably should have. Our bill was $200 with tip, for two. One expects consistently excellent. Substitute chef? New help? Would be interesting to know."

Very disappointing. First of all the place just had a horrible cheese smell everywhere. Second, it was almost empty on a Saturday night which gives you a clue. Third, my boyfriend ordered a black label whiskey which is very expensive, and it tasted nothing like a black label. He drinks that a lot so he is very familiar with different types of whiskey. This was definitely a very cheap one. Forth, he ordered a WELL DONE steak which had a little blood on it. He didn&#39;t complain though because we don&#39;t like to create scandals. My food was also very mediocre, nothing special. For the pricing of this restaurant, we would expect something more. Just never going back again. I see they are already loosing lots of customers.

Vassi was our server and she did a great job. She went over all the specials and made suggestions. We had the Schnitzel sandwich on special and the steak sandwich. My suggestion is to not cut the sandwich in quarters, but just in half.  It gets a little messy when the food is falling out after you take a bite. Also, the fries are a little too greasy.  Overall Wildfire is a great place for lunch and dinner with great service, menu, and ambience.  One tip for guests is to leave the casual dress at home..."

She did, and I was very happy to see there were plenty of options. 

But then the second waiter came over and told me that he was making me my own appetizer, and even a salad with gluten-free croutons! He totally didn&#39;t have to do that, I would have had enough to eat, but it was so nice to be able to participate in each course of the meal with everyone else. It was such a nice way to enjoy the meal. 

Speaking of, the food was exceptional. We had the skirt steak, and it tasted like it had been marinated for years, it was so tender. The flavor was amazing. Every course we had was absolutely delicious, the drinks were great, and the service was above and beyond.

Nancy paid close attention to every detail and was a good conversationalist. She knew the menu well and helped make our anniversary dinner memorable. The food was amazing.

Two of us are on business travel so we were looking for something that wasn&#39;t really a chain. The menu is big, almost too big. Big enough that the menu could be a diner. The big man you made me very cautious, but the average star rating on yelp make me optimistic.

First, we had very good service from a lovely young lady who did everything she could to make sure we had a great time. She worked hard to get us the right wine offering a couple of tastings and some good suggestions. In the end we shared a bottle of the House wine and it was very good, A Cabernet.

For dinner one had the skirt steak, and the other had the halibut special. The skirt steak was really fantastic, a generous piece of meat floating in its juices served with a side of creamed spinach that was delicious. We also had the shrimp appetizer and plenty of house-made onion bread.

We found this place on OpenTable and probably could not have done any better."

My wife and I took the kids for a weekend away at a local hotel and decided to take them out to dinner on Saturday night as a family.  We have been here before, the food is always great so we were all excited to go.  

We arrived at 4:30PM and it was slightly busy but nothing too crazy.  My wife approaches the hostess who greeted us and told her we had a party of five (myself, my wive and our three kids ages 12, 11 and 7).  The hostess gets this odd look on her face, looks at my wife, looks at our kids, then back at my wife and says &#34;we cannot get you in until at least 9PM&#34;.  I was entering the facility at that point and my wife tells me the wait time is going to be almost 5 hours and we could not be seated until 9PM.  I look at my wife with a puzzled look, and say uhhhh ok...I guess we will go somewhere else, I am not waiting that long.

As we are leaving, the hostess keeps saying she is &#34;sorry&#34; which we thought was odd...if you are busy you are busy, no need to be sorry.  My wife and I did not think it was THAT busy, but whatever.  As we are leaving, my wife and I begin talking about how weird the experience was and how it did not feel right.  We both felt that maybe the hostess just did not want to have younger children in the restaurant, but we both were like no...there is no way that is true.

I decided to call the restaurant a couple minutes later (4 minutes after we left) and asked the woman who answered how long the current wait was for &#34;a party of 5&#34;.  She replied &#34;about an hour&#34;.  I asked her if it was typical practice to make customers with children wait nearly 5 hours to dine to which she replied &#34;no, the wait would be the same no matter what&#34;.  I politely told her that did not seem to be the case as we were just told we would have to wait almost 5 hours to be seated just minutes before, thanked her for her help and hung up the phone.

I am thinking and hoping this was just a one off situation where a single employee decided to take things into her own hands, but parents...beware of this location...you may not be wanted depending on the hostess working."

I ordered a side kale and spinach salad that was also very good. 
Lunch is such a shorter wait and must less hectic than dinner.

We were in a private area that fit 4 large round tables. It was a beautiful setting! They provided extra tables for the cake, gifts and favors. 

We started with drinks. I ordered a daiquiri which was good, but not great. The food was served family style. For appetizers, we had chicken and portobello mushroom skewers, chopped salad and cornbread. The chicken was a little dry, but I loved the sauce that came with it. The salad and cornbread were very good. I&#39;ve had the chopped salad before and it was as good as I remember. For entrees, we had chicken, steak, mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. Everything was delicious! By the time dessert came, I was so full. I managed to try the cheesecake and apple crisp with ice cream. Both were a good way to end a satisfying meal.

I accepted and it was definitely a much better experience than the previous visit we made to Wildfire.

We made reservations and came on a weeknight so it was much busier, but the waitress took very good care of us.  I forget her name now, as it&#39;s been a couple months since this last visit, but she was amazing.  Took very good care of us, and was very good with my 15 month old daughter who was kind of making a mess around the table.

She mentioned that they just changed the types of steaks that they offer and that it would be better than the steaks that they were previously carrying, and she wasn&#39;t lying.  Definitely a much better steak than before, cooked perfectly this time.  The food was much better and our experience was top notch.

There are MANY options for steak in the area, and it&#39;s good to know that we can once again consider Wildfire as one of our destinations when we feel the craving for a finely cooked cow."

What we tried: 

Drinks: he had a makers mark old fashioned- very good but we thought it was pretty pricy at $13 
I had the blood orange Cosmo- good! pretty standard martini prices around $10

Food: 
- they brought out warm onion bread with butter- loved that! 
- we got side salads which are a la carte and about $6. My Caesar was ok but way too loaded up with chunks of Parmesan. I love cheese so for me to say it&#39;s too much means it was like 1:1 lettuce to Parmesan.  I also think for $34 for a steak, you can throw in a salad and maybe make your own croutons- not too much work but makes a big difference. 
He got the spinach salad and said it was good 
Entrees- I got the filet with peppercorn sauce- awesome! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, didn&#39;t even need the sauce but it was delicious. Came with choice of one side- I got mashed potatoes.. Very creamy.
He got the porterhouse (huge!) with a horseradish crust and mashed potatoes. He was very happy with it  

They have a Supper Club deal for 6 or more people where you get a lot of courses for $38.. We will probably try that with a group on our next visit!"

The place was completely packed for a weeknight so we elected to sit at the bar.  They have plenty of high tables at the bar all of which are comforatble and give you a good view of the restaurant and the TVs.

To start with you get a loaf of bread with butter......ohhhhh sooooo good....Also before I get started on the food...the drink selection is phenominal...the array of martini&#39;s, beers on tap and even their own craft beers, make this a beer/wine/martini lover&#39;s paradise....

Sorry back to the food......We got this melted goat cheese thing which came with some bread and was to die for....sooo rich and well seasoned I could have just kept eating that all night.  We also tried a veg pizza which was good, but what completely blew us away was the Waldorf Salad....if you have never had this type of salad, you have to try it.  It was hands down THE BEST SALAD I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!   Truly amazing combination of flavors, textures, and ingredients.  The portion was HUGE and was really a meal in itself.  We forced ourselves to save a tiny portion so we could bring it home to the kids.  We also had a dessert which was very good, although I can&#39;t remember what it was.

Overall Wildfire was an exceptional restaurant and we can&#39;t wait to go back to.  The service, the food, and the atmosphere were excellent.  Especially the Waldorf Salad....if you don&#39;t get anything else.....just make sure to try the salad....it will be life changing!!!!"

Arrived at about 6:50 on a Thursday night. The wait was close to our reservation time, 7:30. While waiting I went to the bathroom and let&#39;s just say they needed attention, like toilet paper in stalls! 

After that I decided I&#39;ll kill time waiting and order a drink. I ask the server if the wild strawberry martini is sweet? She told me that it is sweet, I explained that I did not want to taste the liquor and she assured me that they would put less liquor in there. During this transaction our table was ready, so she said she would just bring it over. She brought it over and quickly left. Well the drink tasted strongly of liquor, guess that&#39;s my own fault for ordering an alcoholic beverage. But that&#39;s not my complaint instead of asking me if the drink was okay she was more worried about closing my tab and being done with my transaction. She dropped off the check and circled countless times not even caring to notice that the drink itself was untouched. Whatever I paid and even left a tip because I too was once a server. 

Wish to say that was the only unpleasant experience I had, but the night was young. Our server did not even notice us after the first initial hello. I believe she waved us off as poor tippers because she thought we were young, and diverted extra attention to the table literally right next to us. They also had a birthday and were accommodated at every beck and call, while, we, being right next to them didn&#39;t even get a glance. The bus boy was at our table more than she was, and she was right next to us most the time avoiding eye contact, and chatting away to the table next to us. 

Point of story: Go here and make sure to tell your server you just won at the casino; and you&#39;ll be sure to get five star service!"

First, meat is excellent, as well as fish. Ingredients are delicious and fresh, sauces are exquisite. A great place to have a great meal. The wine menu offers good choice.
Also, the bar is nice, altough often crowded.
Finally, waiters are nice and atmosphere is very pleasant.
I definitely recommend this place."

I didn&#39;t hear anything the server said to one end of our table. I was disappointed  as we were hoping for a better atmosphere. It was also frustrating as our server was not a good communicator. They cannot serve a bottle of wine while other drinks are on the table (stacking)- but instead of telling me that when everyone ordered drinks and I said I would wait for our wine- I had to wait until our meal was served to get my drink. He kept disappearing and the service took forever. It wasn&#39;t as good as I expected based off the reviews and prices. My creme brûlée was goopy and not the right texture.

Was here for a birthday celebration.  Started off with the baked French onion soup, which was good.  My husband &amp; I both ordered the bone in ribeye.  Clearly, it was not ribeye at all, it was sirloin!.  They did however take my husbands off the bill, because he refused to eat it and wanted nothing in its place.  Another person in our party ordered red skin mashed potatoes, which were mashed up with what appeared to be a wrapper of some sort, or box from the potatoes, complete with writing on it?? How could someone plate that without noticing?  They also did take his meal off the bill.  The experience was far from good.   We will not be back."

After the horrible stretch of restaurants that had 4 star ratings (when they really should have been 3 or less) - I walked into Wildfire with some colleagues and was immediately welcomed by the host. A nice big friendly greeting - had everyone in the group laughing and had us seated quickly without reservations (NOTE to fellow Yelpers, make the reservation). 
Food was AMAZING - from the Bison Burger, the French dip, the scallops wrapped in bacon (Yum!) to the salmon on a cedar plank - it was all very tasty and well prepared. The steak ordered at the table also looked very tantalizing - made me wish that I came hungrier. 
So a huge surprise in Schaumberg, IL - this place was excellent! They are pricey - but the quality of the food reflects the price. If I&#39;m in the area again - I would definitely make this a mandatory dinner stop."

I&#39;m not a huge fan of their booths either and would rather sit at a regular table. Sitting in the booth makes me feel like I&#39;m making a presentation to the whole restaurant or something because they are big half-moon booths that face the dining area.

When our server finally came to take our order, I inquired about the soup of the day. The Shrimp &amp; Crab Bisque is pretty good, so I ordered that as an appetizer. My friend ordered the Grilled Chicken Wildorf salad, and I ordered the Black Bean burger and a side of green beans. Our server repeated our entire order back to us and off he went.

Fast forward 30 minutes, we got our salad, burger and green beans. After taking one bite out of the burger, my eyes widened like I just saw a ghost. It had such a strong cumin flavor to it, and I have a minor allergy to cumin! I&#39;ve had plenty of black bean burgers but none had such a strong cumin flavor to them. I had to send it back and ended up getting the Grilled Chicken Wildorf salad also. The salad and green beans were delicious. I noticed while eating my salad that my soup never came. When I finally got a hold of our server and asked him about the soup, he said that I never ordered it and even looked at his order pad. Dude! I saw your mouth and heard you confirm Shrimp &amp; Crab Bisque when you took our orders. In the end, I decided to just forget about the soup.

On the brighter side, lunch ended with a complimentary birthday dessert of a brownie topped with vanilla ice cream. Tasty dessert but too sweet by the time you eat 3/4 of it.

I recommend going here but when it&#39;s not so busy."

I frequent the Wildfire in the city of Chicago often.  My first impressions was 2 Battlelack hosts, who were over whelmed with their duties as hosts.  I am all for hiring older women, but please make sure they are sweet and kind. These two where like twins and not showing sophistication.  We ended up eating our meal in the bar.  The waitress there took 30 minutes to ask if we wanted food. Even though we expressed immediately we would be ordering food when she took our drink order.  Unfortunately she also was another tough Chicago women with attitude. In all my years of dinning this Wildfire deserves a Yelping!  Our food was costly and our Friday that was to be fun, turned out to be a evening of regret.  
No restaurant in the city would hire or tolerate tough women like this.  The entire meal was a peppered with attitude. Lettuce Entertainment is on my Open Table top reservations list.  I do NOT recommend this location.  People skills and manners are part of service. This manager has some etiquette and attitudes to work on his staff with."

It was my first trip to Wildfire, and after being the kind of place that I wouldn&#39;t normally consider on a nicer night out, I&#39;ll definitely plan a trip back. 

The biggest reason for this is the steak. Specifically, the herb crusted steak. They offer a few different kinds, and even a &#34;sampler,&#34; so to speak, where you can try a bit of each. Ordinarily, this is the kind of thing that I would not be a fan of (I think steak is best left to stand on its own merit), but I&#39;m a believer. It was excellent.

Generally speaking, this is the kind of place where you want to go and spend some time. Have a long meal and enjoy yourself."

Crab Cakes - amazing 10/10, comes with a sauce that reminded me of a gourmet take on Mac sauce and is delicious!

Crab/Shrimp Bisque - creamy, rich, and with plenty of crab meat. Some of the best I&#39;ve had. 9/10

Porterhouse - I ordered mine medium-rare with a twice baked potato crust. It was amazing. I was practically gnawing at the bone after I finished it. Great cut and flavor. 10/10

I tried two desserts, one was a volcano cake that was brought out for my birthday. The other was the warm chocolate chip cookie they make in skillet and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Both were heavenly. 9/10

The bar is available while you wait. It is called Martini Lounge, but does not live up to its name. Again, for a martini lounge I expected exquisite martinis. My blood orange martini tasted like lemon acid and was too sour to drink. I didn&#39;t finish it. The beer and wine samples are kinda fun, but then again, they are preselected for you and are not always good (only 2 of my five reds tasted ok). Also, didn&#39;t finish it.

When I confronted the hostess with this I was told that there were many reservations and that if they seated us then there would be no place to seat the people with reservations.  Perhaps they should work on their reservation system so as not to have so many empty tables all at once.

I had the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich with the Creamed Spinach (had this last time here) and the Prime Rib Beef on this sandwich is sliced so thin and no fat ... great taste too with the dip. Could hardly finish. As a Birthday surprise our waiter (who was really good) brought me the Brownie &amp; Ice Cream for dessert and even though I was like over full it tasted great too.

I&#39;m a big fan of classy, upscale, stylish restaurants with diverse, creative menu items. Let me tell you, Wildfire is not any of these things. In this day and age, any restaurant worth its salt (see what I did there?) should offer a more diverse menu. There should be vegetarian, vegan and gluten free menu items available-yes, even at a steakhouse. Sadly, there were no such items available on Wildfire&#39;s very limited menu. The seafood and pasta menu was paltry at best and there were maybe ten beers on tap and fifteen draught beers. What a pathetic selection. This is a classic case of a restaurant trying to survive on brand recognition only. Maybe Wildfire has expanded beyond the actual business that it is capable of handling (i.e. gotten too big for its britches). Maybe some big chain of bland restaurants bought it up. Who knows? Whatever the case may be, I was less than impressed. The ambience-rather than upbeat and energetic-seemed over crowded and extremely loud. Here was almost no room to walk between tables out of the restaurant floor. Tables were jammed side to side and back to back throughout. There was absolutely no privacy. It seems that Wildfire did their best to cram people in like sardines no matter what the cost to the exclusive atmosphere and private, classy ambience that once went hand in hand with the Wildfire name. There were even young children eating there. This is most certainly not a restaurant where high chairs and kiddie menus are appropriate. I&#39;m not paying upwards of $50 for my portion of the meal so that I can sit around and listen to screaming children. The bathrooms were a mess. They were certainly not what one would expect from an upscale restaurant-even a chain restaurant. Although the food was fairly good and the portions were large, nothing screamed &#34;eat me&#34; (lol). It was all mostly just passable. The waiter, who was very nice-as were the rest of the staff, which is mainly why I&#39;m awarding Wildfire the three stars that I am-seemed very attentive at first and then rather than turning our table with two people who were only waiting for the check and dessert, chose to attend to order taking at a table of no less than seventeen people. Color me unimpressed with that lapse in judgment. Overall, not the experience I had hoped for for my last big dinner out before my surgery this week. I should&#39;ve headed down the way to Seasons 52 or Shaw&#39;s Crab House. Heck, even Cooper&#39;s Hawk would&#39;ve been perfect. Growing up, I always heard Gibson&#39;s and Wildfire mentioned in the same sentence. No more. The difference is very clear! 
 The best part of our experience was the helpful waiter who went out of his way to bring us our check when our waiter left us hanging and the kindly people at the host stand who held our table for us even though we arrived late due to bad directions."

Appetizers, salads, drinks, desserts and of course, the main dinner course. First of all, lets start with the drinks, bigger than average drinks and full pours, no skimping! However, you do really have to charge $48 FOR 3 MARTINIS? I can get a whole bottle of Grey Goose for $23... Past that, all serving are large and more than enough. They have delicious steaks, ribs and pork chops! Their sides are large and good. Dessert enters a whole new arena, the hot fudge sundae serves a table of 4 if you can even eat it after the meal. All in all, a great place, I would give 5 stars but they need to get the cost of the drinks under control and to a reasonable price, we aren&#39;t downtown on a rooftop."

The drinks are delicious -- they have the uncommon Martini Flight, where you get a sampling for four individual martinis for around $12-13. Really loved this option, as I don&#39;t know martinis well and got to try a few, the best of which was the Stormy Night. I would return just for this flight and an appetizer.

Speaking of appetizers, my party of two ordered the Wildfire Chopped Salad, which is just a fancier version of Portillo&#39;s Chopped Salad (here they add dressing upfront, avocado and more of the blue cheese, perhaps a touch too much, which made it salty). Be absolutely SURE you ask for dressing on the side! This salad is so big for around $12, that you can come just for drinks and this... However, if you have leftovers, keeping the dressing off allows you to take it home. We also had bacon wrapped scallops, which were small (expected) and quite good -- about 6 pieces total.

As for dinner, I got the Filet Mignon Trio, which was all perfect and cooked on-target.

HOWEVER. For another $30 or so, my partner got the Beef Wellington and asked for rare, but got well done. We should have and did not request a correction, as he was paranoid &#34;what the kitchen would do&#34; (that whole wrap, lol) to the replacement food.

In the end, the entire meal was a whopping $140, no tax.

I&#39;ve confirmed now that Wildfire -- like all LEYE (Lettuce Entertain You) restaurants -- offers mostly delicious food, but man, for the tab some of these dinners result in, I really expect the dishes to be vetted and double-checked before being served. Cheesecake costs half as much and is perfect every darn time.

FYI: Wildfire is a BEAUTIFUL restaurant. Spacious and open, it almost reminds me of a luxurious, modern interpretation of the Copacabana club (I&#39;ve only seen on TV, haha)."

One of the guys strongly recommended the TNT roll....a cooked roll, smothered in sauce. Not something I would voluntarily choose to eat of my own accord.  HOLY COW!!!  It was FANTASTIC!!!!

Hubster ordered the mixed sushi plate and the King Kong roll.  He was in heaven!  Their smoked salmon is really good, too!  Perfect choice for us tonight!  Thanks, fellow Yelpers, you never steer us wrong!!  This is our first time in Schaumburg, but after a dinner like this...we are going to make it a point to come back!

I can appreciate creativity and innovation for Japanese food but sometimes, it becomes less and less about the fish. When it comes to sushi, I want to be able to taste the actual fish. Minami does a great job of not straying too far away of what sushi should taste like while still creating their own combinations. The Super Whitey role had fatty tuna on the inside with white tuna on the outside and then topped with furikake - seasoned rice topping made from seaweed. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen furikake on a sushi roll and it worked well together. The fish was handled and prepared well in each of our dishes from the temperature and texture.  

We received great service throughout the meal and even the prices were surprisingly reasonable. There was a deal on Yelp for a $30 voucher for only $15 that I took advantage of as well. Check out Minami if you are craving sushi that has a blend of both traditional and creativity where the fish is still at the forefront."

I&#39;ve been wanting to try Minami for as long as I can remember. We drive past multiple times a week and just keep driving. This time was different. After deciding we didn&#39;t have the patience for a lengthy wait at another local eatery, we decided to give Minami a shot. What do you know?  No wait!  Yes they had a pretty full house, but they seated us immediately and drinks followed shortly thereafter. We were hungry, but didn&#39;t want to over order, so we went with the shrimp shumai, some ebi, some sake, a Philly roll and the King Kong roll. We declined the complimentary miso soup. And then we waited. 

And waited. 

And waited. To the point that my very hungry husband was giving me the five minute warning. 

BINGO!  Here&#39;s the shumai. Yum!!  But gone way too fast. 

So we waited some more. And then started to get annoyed by how cold it was by the front of the restaurant where we were sitting. Very little seemed to be going right. They offered a salad due to the lengthy wait. We declined (which in hindsight was dumb). 

Eventually everything else hit the table. Wanna know what?  It was delicious!!  The two of us LOVED the King Kong roll. Everything was really good!  Was it worth the wait?  Maybe. They seem to have a really heavy carry out business going on which must keep them super busy. Next time, we will call and order our food and then drive over to eat it there. ;-)"

We ordered a sushi boat at 4:15pm asking for delivery at 6:30 as we are feeding friends and a child.. at 6:25 we got a call they are running 25-30 minutes late with our food.. huh. We order at 4:15 and at 6:25 we get a call our food will be late... no call prior to inform us and our guest the food was delayed....  I asked about a discount or gift card for the delay and hassle to our friends and I&#39;m told &#34;sorry&#34; there is nothing we can do for you...

No Malloy I might not be so offended but this is a place we have ordered from dozens of times and spent thousands of dollars.. their willingness to lose a client over a $10-15$ coupon speaks volumes of the service they are willing to provide...  

Sorry Minami you have lost me as a client as there are other places to order from that actually care about their clients...


They said it takes 20 good reviews to make up for one bad one.. I posted n Facebook and yelp ,.. hope the inability to assist a long time loyal client pays off. 

Our business will go to Tokyo Sushi in Bartlett that smiles and cares about us."

We sat down and ordered crab rangoon, this crab rangoon was different than any other ive ever tried, it had crab on top with a sauce, so good!

Here&#39;s the kicker, they only offered to give me Terriyaki sauce and spicy mayo sauce at no charge. Really?

I ordered the Ten Don (shrimp and vegetable tempura over bowl of rice) which was delicious! You can get it alone for $9, or as a set for 14 bucks which comes with soup, salad, 3 pieces of gyoza, &amp; 3 pieces of nigiri (shrimp, salmon, and tuna). Talk about a deal! I ordered the set and it was a LOT of food. I could only eat half of it.

I&#39;ve got nothing bad to say about the servers either! They were very nice, polite, attentive, and  quick to refill our waters and clear the plates off our table.

It had a very inviting decor, great ambiance, and subtle colors and design. 

They served us complimentary miso soup. Yay for free soup! It was a decent miso, not too overwhelming. My husband and I ordered the seaweed salad and the crab salad for our appetizers. We ordered the Nabeyaki Udon, Unagidon, and Godzilla Roll. 

The roll was sweet and had a hint of spice. It was still somewhat warm so the cream cheese and soft and melded well with the crunch elements. I would order this again when craving a well-rounded amount of taste and crunch. 

Nabeyaki Udon was served in a pot. Had an undertone of sweetness. Unagidon was served with seaweed salad as well, so make sure you don&#39;t order seaweed salad as an appetizer lol. 

We left extremely full and satisfied."

Either location is fantastic, but this one is closer for me.
I order through grub hub a majority of the time, but don&#39;t be afraid to pop in for lunch or dinner. The location since the remodel seems bigger and more inviting. You can even give them a call for pick up and hear a welcoming and helpful voice on the other end.

Every so often grubhub lies and tells me an earlier time than they are actually ready for and I have to wait but it&#39;s never a pain for me. They are so courteous and wonderful; chit chatting while you wait, so the time just flies. Plus the food is worth it!

Oh yes, the food! That&#39;s what everyone cares about right?
Everything is made fresh and nothing sits around. Each roll is made lovingly and precise. I have NEVER had to take anything back or complain.

Apparently they remodeled and got all new staff... not too happy about that. Because I had been here, I wanted to try their other location on Golf Rd., especially because they offered a $15 for $30 deal and free egg roll. When I got there, however, they were closed for painting and I was told to try the Streamwood location. I was hoping they&#39;d offer the same deal, but nope. Seeing the new layout, I don&#39;t like it. There&#39;s hardly any lighting (just small circle lights scattered across the ceiling), that cast an ugly orange color. From here, the service was just awkward and below average the whole time. 

First, they led my date and I to a table that still had to be wiped down, so we stood in front of it waiting for that to happen. Then, the waitress said they did not have some of the speciality cocktails. When I went to order, it turns out they had none of the cocktails. So I got a cheap wine. Then, we got our miso soup and salad. The soup was luke warm and ended up being cold after a few short minutes (which I was disappointed by because I was sick and wanted something hot). Another waitress brought our rolls out, and began to walk away. I said excuse me, which rolls are which? She incorrectly identified ALL FOUR rolls that we got... she said Laura Bobby? And I&#39;m like... Laura Abby? It was a bad guessing game. I&#39;m glad we remembered which we ordered. Then as I went to pour some soy sauce, I realized we did not have the little trays to put them in (this is because the table wasn&#39;t ready for us when we first got in!) Finally we try the sushi. It was alright. Some were kind of mushy, a weird combo of ingredients. Didn&#39;t satisfy my sushi craving, but wasn&#39;t too bad either. When it came time to order mochi, of course they were out of that too. I wanted Red Bean, my date, Green Tea. She went to check just in case they had gotten any more since the last time she worked. She came back and of course, the only one they were out of was Red Bean. I was laughing at this point. So we finally paid and got out of there. 

My conclusion? I won&#39;t be visiting this place again. Which is a shame because it used to be a favorite! I may still consider delivery and skip all the awkward service and not in stock items..."

With the Yelp deal and some extra, we ordered the Maki Combo (REALLY good deal for 2 people), Baked Mussels, the the Sweet Crunch Crab &amp; Shrimp Roll. For how much food we got (way more than enough for 2 people), we barely paid anything. It was a steal! Everything was fresh, and tasted delish. I would do it all over again!!"

Don&#39;t let yourself be dismayed by the exterior of the restaurant. It&#39;s simple, clean, and cozy inside. The food quality and presentation is impressive! I&#39;ve tried many sushi spots in the surrounding area (especially Schaumburg) and this has become the top of my list. 

For appetizer, we tried the crab rangoon. It came as four pieces and was as filling as a single roll. It was very tasty and rich. we ordered the Volcano, Hell, Salmon Avalanche, and Super White Tuna rolls. If you are a fan of white tuna, the Super White roll will win you over instantly. Each roll had it&#39;s own distinct taste and the quality of fish was very good. Also, the rolls are not overloaded with rice and the fried rolls are not heavily battered. I was VERY satisfied with my meal and it seemed that the other customers were as well!"

Wow what a great sushi restaurant in the Northwest Suburb. I tried this with the Yelp deal and I am sold and will be a repeat customer. They have daily lunch specials with variable options including teriyaki chicken/salmon and other options per their website. I had the chicken teriyaki which was ample in size with chicken that was tender and moist. They give you a healthy helping of sushi rice to go with your meal which is a plus. I hate leaving lunch after eating a bento box hungry. In addition they had a shumai and 2 gyoza. The salad was blah, but whatever. The california roll was done well. Servers were quick and friendly. 

Pro- inexpensive lunch specials, friendly server, YELP deal

Con- salad was blah, the pork tontkatsu fried skin fell off the pork and was not done as well as can be

Hidden deal- Daily lunch specials. The currently yelp deal is a steal 10 for 20 which should give you no reason not to try this place"

We stick to our California, Phili, &amp; Vegas rolls.  Simple but delicious.  This was our 1st time here even though we have lived in the area for 15 + years and have driven past it hundreds of times.  

They hit it out of the park.  I like the option of 6 or 8 pieces.  We tend to share everything so more pieces gives the allusion of more food.  :/  Strange how that happens.  Everything was comparable or better to other locals we have been to.  We did order take out.  I wish they gave a soup or sort of salad along with take out orders.  Also, we didn&#39;t get any fortune cookies.  Not sure if those are an option, I&#39;m asking next time.  We will be back!"

The restaurant has decent seating, wasn&#39;t busy, and service is good.  The sushi?  It&#39;s good too, but alas, it&#39;s no Ju Rin.  I hate to compare it to another restaurant, but when you find the best mind blowing sushi ever, you naturally think of that as the standard.  Minami is the type of sushi place that makes amazing specialty (expensive) rolls and the standard boring rolls are good but nothing that will have you phening for more.  I will say that I enjoyed the rolls spice factor, although I did still have to add some wasabi, and the consistency wasn&#39;t too mashed up or squishy (but it wasn&#39;t huge fresh chunks of fish either).  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know I&#39;m picky.  You&#39;re welcome.

Overall, and with the yelp deal especially, this place is certainly worth it."

I&#39;m so happy that their hours are from 3pm-9pm on sundays. It was also easter, so that means NOBODY WAS THERE, but me and my boyfriend. It was an awesome experience. 

I like that it&#39;s clean inside and it looks like you&#39;re sitting inside of a korean or japenese home. All of the tables are nicely distributed evenly away from each other so you don&#39;t have to worry about hearing someone else&#39;s conversation. They have a decent waiting area too.

I am in love with the type of music there. It&#39;s almost like Nujabes playing the entire time it&#39;s so cool listening to. PERFECT SUSHI MUSIC.
Service here is good. The waitress was attentive, informative, and sincere.

The sushi here is amazing! Actually all of the food. Number one thing I was afraid of was the sushi having too much rice because I hate that the most and from the looks of it (through the yelp pictures) seemed as though they rolled their sushi with tons of rice which in the end has you feeling full quicker.

What was ordered: 

Baked mussels - 4/5 taste was good, but some of our mussels were broken :( but hey it&#39;s alright because the taste made up for it!

Super white tuna
Spring (Tuna Nigiri) - I can&#39;t really speak about these because I didn&#39;t eat this

Alaskan roll- 5/5 I don&#39;t usually like masago on my rolls, but they smother it inbetween the rolls instead of ontop for me to scoop it off so I was bound to eat it either way. It was still tasty and I didn&#39;t even mind the masago. The roll tasted exactly how I like alaskan rolls to taste. FRESH. This is the reason why I always order it.

Hell roll- 5/5 They weren&#39;t lying when they say it&#39;s SPICY. I&#39;d say it was a good spicy though. It is a mouthful though. 

Dragon roll- 5/5 OMG, this is so damn good here. I&#39;m really impressed by the flavor it had. It wasn&#39;t doused in that sauce and you could still taste eel.

Udon w/shrimp and veggie tempura- 5/5 comes with salad and the boyfriend &amp; I shared this. It wasn&#39;t overly salty tasting and they give you the shrimp and veggie tempura on the side! *BING* That&#39;s a big plus. I love that they do that without us having to ask.

The hot tea cups are bigger than normal compared to other sushi restaurants and I love that. At the end of your order you get to have orange slices. Fruit as your dessert is always a healthy plus.

Overall this place gets 5 stars because it&#39;s close to home, fantastic tasting sushi, AFFORDABLE!! good music = good vibe, and great service.

Hopefully next time you guys have mackeral though. I was down that they didn&#39;t have that because that&#39;s initially what my boyfriend wanted to order.

TIP: Take advantage of their yelp coupon deal. I did and saved a load. Our end total for this great meal was only $49? or like 40bucks."

I&#39;m a sucker for lunch specials and since I work, I can&#39;t get to many lunch specials unless they offer them on Saturdays; luckily this place does. My husband had the shrimp tempura and vegetable lunch special ($6.95) which came with soup, salad, and rice. My children shared the salmon teriyaki lunch special ($6.95) came with soup, salad, and rice. And I got the 2 maki combo ($8.95) which came with soup and salad. I swear the menu said seaweed salad but for some reason, a regular salad came and the waitress was all alone and taking quite some time to get back to me so I just left it as it was. We also added on 3 nigiri pieces for $3 as well as an ebi tempura roll for $3.

They do have a yelp deal which makes for an awesome savings when paired with the lunch specials. My whole family of 4 ate for $28 (tax and gratuity included) and we were stuffed. 

The seafood was good, except the salmon was a bit fishy which means it wasn&#39;t very fresh. The sushi pieces were big and they don&#39;t skimp out on the portion of fish they use. The shrimp tempura lunch special was really good and the salmon teriyaki had great flavor but wasn&#39;t too over powered by the teriyaki sauce. I wouldn&#39;t recommend the ebi tempura unless you&#39;re a fan of crab. It was 1/2 crab, 1 piece of ebi tempura, and very small portions of avocado and cucumber. Food was rated 4 stars

The food was pretty great but the service was not so great. I don&#39;t think it had anything to do with our waitress but the fact that there was only one for a Saturday Lunch hour. The place wasn&#39;t packed but it was fairly busy and she didn&#39;t come around as often as I would have liked. Definitely recommend them adding another server for the lunch hour rush on a weekend. The service is what brought this down to a 3 star review. Maybe next time there will be more servers and better service so I can bump this up to a deserved 4. 

Otherwise, the food was great and if you don&#39;t mind lack of service you should definitely try this place. Especially for the price for great sushi, you can&#39;t beat it."

A hidden gem of a place. Went there with some friends for dinner (one in the bunch was actually Japanese). For a first visit, you will want to search for parking which is at the side of the Restaurant. The decor was pleasant and well lit inside.  Hostess was awesome! As soon as you walk in.. you see Sushi Bar and two friendly Japanese staff preparing Sushi. Music was contemporary (would rather have listened to Japanese music for the entire Sushi/Japanese experience). Not a big deal (just saying). .... We got there around 7 p.m. and all booths were taken. Got a table by the Traditional looking Japanese window which was also just as nice. This staff were all FANTASTIC! and the service was very prompt. Two service staff (not Japanese) took turns periodically coming to our table and female Servers with great Vibe were casually chatting with us every now and then. Drink all the hot green tea you want. There is no alcohol served because in the midst of Liquor license renewal process. (which did not matter to us). Order the Sushi Boat (Boat Platter) for Four $70.   This comes with Small Soup and Small Salad.. and thank goodness for that because there was more than enough Sushi in the Boat. Nathan (Japanese pal and expert Sushi maker) marked his approval on the Soup, Sushi, rolls, and Sashimi. At the end of the meal, they serve you a whole orange cut in quarter piece. No damp hand towels for my poor chop stick skills and messy hands...  Good reason to check out the restroom ( which was super nice). Will like to try this place lunch menu sometime? Great Vibe, Good Food, Good People! oh and....Great place to take a date, too (hint hint)...lol."

Min was in the process of putting the finishing touches on a new ramen dish so he offered to let me try it out. Being a ramen fan, I didn&#39;t hesitate and was rewarded with a smooth, simple, and not overly salty bowl of tasty goodness.

The pork belly slices were very soft and melted in my mouth. Not the grilled or chewier style that I&#39;m used to but it perfectly complimented the smooth flavor of the broth. The noodles were cooked just right and had a nice chew to it as well. This item is not officially on the menu as of this review but I was told that it will be soon at a price of around $9 as well a lunch special option.

I&#39;m always pleased  when I stop in and have yet to have a bad experience so I&#39;ve raised my rating to 5 stars. Check out the ramen as soon as you get a chance!"

So a lot of the reviews prior to 2010 do not apply.  I guess it&#39;s the same name but I just think it would be good for people to know.  

Minami is a great little sushi spot in the suburbs.  From the outside, it looks kinda small but it&#39;s nice once you step inside.  The atmosphere is very casual and inviting, unlike some sushi restaurants.  There is plenty of room and you aren&#39;t squeezed 2 ft away from the next table.

The prices are good and the sushi is fresh.  No frozen stuff.  The appetizers are also delicious.  I recommend the spicy shrimp tempura and the Japanese crab rangoons.  The service is top notch and prompt.  They are quick to recommend different options if you aren&#39;t sure what to get.  Presentation of the dishes are well thought out. 

I have yet to try all the rolls yet but eventually I will.  So far I really like the volcano roll.  The chicken teriyaki was very moist and not too dry.  Even the katsu are thin but not too dry.  The beer is pretty cheap compared to many sushi spots and they have a tv that is usually playing a game with the volume on low.  

The sushi chef and owner, Min, is a friendly guy and will strike up conversation with you if you are sitting at the bar.  Sarah is the co-owner and you may be lucky enough to have her wait on you.  They are both very friendly.  I always think it&#39;s nice to talk to the actual owners of an establishment.

I really like Minami and I think it will be my go to sushi spot.  It&#39;s up there with Kinta for me, but I like the layout of Minami better.  Minami is a really great sushi spots with some location issues.  But that means that you won&#39;t have to wait long.  I&#39;ll definitely be back."

The other day I had a taste for Minami&#39;s tempura udon.  Best part of this idea? Minami delivers.  While I live only ten minutes away (at most), I was laid up with a bad back and my sister was sick, so delivery was definitely the way to go! 

Ordered at 12:15pm.  Our order consisted of a spicy shrimp tempura bento box, two tempura udons, and a nigiri sushi lunch special.  Was told it would take about 40 minutes.  No problem, time to binge watch some netflix while we wait.  

Soon began to get that ridiculous state of hangry (so hungry, so angry) but figured, okay.  if something was wrong, they would have called.  Surely, that&#39;s protocol anywhere, right?  Well I looked at the clock and noticed it was about 145.  Uhm...that&#39;s way longer than 40 minutes (so I got lost in Netflixlandia, sue me).  Called Minami, who assured me the delivery girl had left a while back, and should be there any minute.  Okay, so..next episode. 

Cue 2:00.  Almost two hours after ordering, my food hasn&#39;t arrived.  Remember how I said that I lived ten minutes away, tops? Definitely could have eaten there and come back home with plenty of time for relaxation. But no, instead I waited for cold food to be delivered.  

In Minami&#39;s defense, they did comp the entire order.  However.  The explanation for the lateness of the food was that the delivery girl was lost and &#39;sort of new&#39;.  Well, great.  Why didn&#39;t she call? Or call Minami? Because upon our next call to Minami, they knew where we were located.  But instead, the delivery girl stated that she just drove back and forth looking for our place.  While our food just sat there getting cold.  

So I go back to the food quality.  Cold soup arrived, but one of the containers had a small hole and was draining out into the plastic bag.  Soggy tempura that was coated in oil. Nigiri? Was it worth eating after sitting in the delivery girls warm car for one hour?! No thanks, would rather not risk being sick. And last but not least the spicy shrimp tempura.  The entire bento box was covered in the spicy tempura sauce, as if it had been rolling around in the delivery girls car. Everything we ordered ended up in the trash. It was all completely inedible. 

So yes, while it was great of Minami to comp the food, it was inedible anyways.  So basically they just sent us something to throw out.  Won&#39;t order from here again.  It&#39;s a shame too, because I normally do enjoy their food."

The sushi is good and the prices are not too bad as well. We&#39;ve had almost all the food on the menu since coming here and we have no complaints about the food.

The only reason I give Minami 3 stars is because the service is usually slow and you don&#39;t get anything hot like the hot tea (warm tea) and the miso soup. It is always warm or cold.

We&#39;ve been here over 20 times (mostly during the week nights) over the past 2 years and we&#39;ve been occasionally comped free edamame or gyoza as an apology for waiting (even when the restaurant is not busy). The sushi chefs are very slow and we are always told during every visit that the food will be ready soon where the servers have to keep us informed of the status.

Also, you will never receive any hot beverages or miso soup. Each and every time we got hot green tea it is either Luke warm or cold. I complained a couple times and they reheated it, but I stopped complaining because it never comes out hot the first time and even when they refill your cup it is still warm. The miso soup is always warm or cold as well. My wife thinks that they microwave it instead of having a hot soup pot simmering on a stove.

Overall Minami has good food and prices, but they need to work on their speed of making sushi and provide hot beverages and soup."

I have dined here several times so far and I love it each time. The menu is enormous and the staff is incredible! The first time we went, we had about seven people in our group and the restaurant had a lot of to-go orders, so our food was taking a long time, but the staff made up for it by giving us free appetizers, salads, and soups. This has happened several times and it shows how much the staff really cares for their customers. The only beef I have is that they are kind of pricey. I don&#39;t know if they ever offer coupons or anything, but you can easily spend $100 on two people eating sushi there on a date. Still, love eating here, glad they are so close to my work, the service is phenomenal (something that is seriously lacking at my personal fave, Sushi Para), and the atmosphere is great."

We have tried many sushi appetizer salads but that Poku salad is definitely on top of my list. Everything else was great too, fresh fish, fresh rice, very good service although place was not very crowded when we stepped in.

Located in a little corner of a strip mall, it might be a little hard to find but its definitely worth it. We had:

Miso Soup: Standard miso soup you get at any Japanese place (FREE!)

Salad: Lettuce salad with a ginger lemony dressing, not bad (FREE)

Agedashi Tofu: GIANT portion for 5 bucks. (See picture.) It was fried perfectly and tasted amazing. 

Tempura Udon: Another large sized bowl with little bits of tempura and seaweed floating around in a light soy broth. It was great! Tempura shrimp and veges that came with was super crunchy too. ($9) (see picture)

Shrimpnator: A work of art. (See picture), this roll has eel, shrimp, fried soft shell crab AND fish row (HOLY COW 4 ANIMALS in 1 ROLL TAKE THAT PETA!) Tasted amazing and definitely worth the price ($13)

Slice of Pineapple: Its cut in a beautiful wedge shape with 2 little cocktail swords for easy eating. (FREE!) 

Aside from the great food, the atmosphere is very clean and neat and best of all there is a lot of space in the dining room so the tables aren&#39;t cramped next to each other. Service was super attentive and very kind. 

Minami is a testament to good quality, good service, and good value. Basically we ordered 3 dishes and got a 6 course meal. It was a great experience and we are definitely returning as often as we can. You gotta try this place!"

I went there today for lunch with a Yelp deal - and I left absolutely stuffed.  Most times when restaurants have lunch specials they make the servings smaller, so that is what I expected here.  Boy, was I wrong!  As it turns out, I would have been more than satisfied with the two roll lunch special.  

I sat at the sushi bar and watched the owner/sushi chef Min make the rolls, and let me tell you, he cuts the fish thick!  That, combined with the quality of the fish he serves, make this place a great deal.

For the lunch special, I had the Laura-Abby and the Ebi tempura rolls.  I also ordered (and had to struggle to finish due to being so full) the aptly named Hell roll.  I t was good but as spicy as the name suggests...but in a good way.

Excellent quality, excellent prices...I will be back."

I have ordered from them 4 or 5 times recently, and every time is REALLY great.  Probably better than the last.  The spider roll and the lasagna roll are great--yes I know that sounds strange but trust me, it&#39;s a must-get.

OH, and their fried rice is by FAR the best I&#39;ve ever had :)

The only thing that I was somewhat put off by is the fact that we only sometimes get the salad that&#39;s supposed to come with the meal.  There&#39;s no rhyme or reason about why we DO and DON&#39;T get it at certain times.  But I love me some salad, so that&#39;s not something I could overlook!"

The new owner is also the sushi chef.  Very nice guy.  The first time we came here, the restaurant was packed on a Friday night.  After our 5-star experience, I understood why the restaurant was packed!  GREAT SUSHI, GREAT STAFF!

We sat at the sushi bar.  The chef talked with us about different kinds of sushi and recommended new sushi rolls I thought I&#39;d never try.  THEY WERE ALL DELICIOUS!!!  I can&#39;t decide on a favorite sushi roll in this restaurant yet because they were all good! 

+ DELCIOUS and FRESH SUSHI!

+ Super friendly service!!!  The second time we came in, the sushi chef/owner and the head waitress remembered us and thanked us for coming back.  Wow!  Talk about getting to know your customers!  KUDOS, MINAMI RESTAURANT!

I went here on a Sunday around 5pm and to my surprise we were one of the only few in the restaurant. We were seated promptly and tended to by a cheery young lady who took our drink orders and handed us a list of sushi to pick from. 

I started off with  bowl of miso as per usual and was quite pleased. The broth was nice and flavorful, plus it was a nice was treat on a cold evening. We then got started with a few of the specialty Maki rolls, Wasabi Lemon Tuna and the Tiger roll...My God was it amazing! My favorite pick of the whole meal was the Lemon Tuna roll, it was fresh and bursting with citrusy deliciousness. We had a regular spicy tuna roll in between that actually had a little kick to it (which is rare) and finally we ended our meal with the Sushi Sandwich. This large roll fit for a king and was oozing with all different sorts of toppings. All which married together beautifully. This roll is by no means the healthiest pick but man oh man is it scrumptious. 

We were stuffed by the end and decided to skip out on ordering dessert but they gave us a complimentary wedge of perfectly ripe pineapple (nice touch). It was altogether a fantastic Sunday dinner and I will be making my rounds to Minami in the very near future, two thumbs way up!"

I was starving and turning into a huge butthole, so we went early around 6pm. There were only a few other tables with folks, but I attribute it to date and time as opposed to the quality. I found the sushi to be very good. Between the two of us we tried the dragon, Chicago, spicy tuna, and spicy salmon rolls. All were very good with the spicy Salmon being the highlight. I thought the tuna was too spicy, but the little lady was kind enough to remind me that I&#39;m a pussy, so it probably isn&#39;t that bad.

I would definitely recommend this place, and would likely go back."

Ours wasn&#39;t up until April but we decided to head a little farther South than usual on Barrington road and Golf for a late lunch and received solid attentive service from Sarah. They have several lunch specials that range $6.95 to $10, and include miso and salad. Additional regular maki were only $3, very reasonable imo.  Larger than it looks from the outside with a lot of wood and typically only a few windows. Minami also has a small party room for your next wedding or divorce celebration in the back.

As a few other have mentioned, I find their sauces a little sweet so you might to ask for that last dribble over your maki on the side or not at all; a lemon squeeze is another defense I have for the too salty or sweet already on the plate. My other half liked the sweeter sauces, but then she is not a sushi or chili fan. I had Katusdon which is great winter-is-coming comfort food for me, yummy egg and onions toppings but the pork cutlet was not only very thin but somehow surprising tough like it had been microwaved too high heat it up.  My partner&#39;s tempura shrimp plate was perfect for her letting her try the traditional clearer rice shrimp tempura and and one with a sweeter sauce over shrimp and tasty shrooms.  I&#39;ll be back, without my less adventurous dining partner, at the sushi counter for a chirashi bowl on my next visit.

Bottomless smoky green tea. Here&#39;s the Kanji for Mimami, we forgot to ask for the meaning, next time. 南
Solid 3 1/2 for a first visit. Try it. TGIF!"

When we walked in we were greeted promptly and shown to our seats and given menus. Within a few minutes our waitress checked in with us and took our drink orders. The service throughout the dinner was very good. 

To start we ordered Meso soup which was complementary along with the Las Vagas roll and the King Kong roll. Both were very good sized portions and very good. We walked out stuffed and paying under $30.00 for a good dinner. 

Their menus do not have photos however, if you ask they do have a photo book available which will help you in the decision making process."

The sushi is super fresh and they have so much variety it&#39;s crazy!

I come from Hawaii where we always have a fantastic choice of good Japanese food, I have been searching for a good place and so far this is it. My only question was about the owner. I have a problem with any old Asian trying to make sushi. I want Japanese to run/own Japanese restaurants just like I want Koreans to run Korean restaurants and so on and on. My pet peeve is Japanese/Chinese restaurants combined! I think the owner IS in fact Japanese. He also made our sushi, but servers were uneducated on true Japanese food.

The Green roll was the last one we got and it was a nice refreshing way to end the meal.  Our sushi chef, I believe he was also the owner, talked about how he had worked in California and Las Vegas.

I&#39;ve never personally walked in; my boyfriend picks up our food, and I&#39;m in charge of the delivery. And we&#39;ve never actually tried their pizza; I&#39;ll get the kids&#39; macaroni and cheese, he&#39;ll get a cheesy Italian beef on garlic bread, and we&#39;ll both each get a gondola dog (a hotdog wrapped in pizza dough and cheese). It&#39;s all so freakin&#39; good, albeit greasy, we&#39;re still guilty of ordering here at least twice a week. 

Honestly, their kids&#39; mac and cheese probably won&#39;t be for everyone. If you&#39;re expecting something fancy, you can move along. These are literally just penne noodles doused in cheddar cheese sauce. Add a little salt, and it&#39;s perfect. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so damn good, but it is. I usually get two of them, and it&#39;s enough.

Their Italian beef is so generously portioned and delicious. 

Tortellini stefano is good, but I missed my mac and cheese when I ordered it. 

Calzones are good, but nothing special. They aren&#39;t cut in half, and they&#39;re huge, so be prepared to have some leftovers. 

Their breadsticks are AMAZING. They&#39;re like garlicky bites of heaven in your mouth. An order of breadsticks is tiny (I think they give you three?) so I suggest you get a lot of them, because they&#39;re super addicting. 

Delivery is always quicker than their estimated time, which is a nice little surprise each time.

I recommend trying Papa Saverio&#39;s at least once. You either like it or you don&#39;t. I most certainly do!"

I love pizza, and I like trying new places.  What a great surprise this was.  BEST PIZZA I have had in a long time.  In fact, I was so impressed I had to go back to check reviews that were negative/critical... Seems like most the neg reviews were based on price/size/value.  Maybe it&#39;s not the cheapest pizza, but if you want cheap pizza you will not get anything this good.  I ordered the pepperoni supreme and will definitely do so again anytime I&#39;m in the area."

I called and asked the friendly voice on the other end if she knew anything about this; and if not, would they be able to recreate it. She told me many people in this town ask for it. Hurray!

If you&#39;re not familar with this, it&#39;s their Italian beef sandwich converted into a pizza with its natural juices, mozzarella cheese and hot (mild or both) Giardiniera peppers. I like mine extra thin &amp; crispy but not burnt. 

WIth tonight&#39;s weather, it took almost a full hour for delivery to make it to my Sister&#39;s house. She is only a mile away from this location.

As for the pizza itself, it&#39;s hard to judge a place on slices alone. Slices are typically to ho or two cold or have misaligned ingredients slathered over the top. These slices were lukewarm by the time I got home - overall the deal was great, but frankly I have had better pizza.

I opted for the X-Large Thin Crust Empire which was loaded with every topping you can think of. The sauce was great and although the dough was a less crispier than expected, it was still absolutely delicious!

The thing I was REALLY impressed with was the customer service. The owner accidentally goofed up my order so when I came to pick it up, the pie wasn&#39;t ready. Although I told him I didn&#39;t mind waiting, he insisted that he deliver the pizza free of charge and threw in the rest of my order for free!!!

Coupon or not, their pizza is delicious, flavorful, and done your way. They&#39;ve got four crusts to choose from ranging from thin crust all the way up to Chicago style crust (extra deep). They have tons of spices and a rich, chunky sauce that just wafts/oozes delight.

If I am going to do it....Thursday is the day, because it&#39;s the Lasagna day at Papa Saverio&#39;s.  Its available every day but at a discount price on Thursdays.The company is closely related to the Rosati&#39;s chain and the food is the same great quality.  The BEST lasagna in the northwest suburbs.....order with meat sauce and meatballs.  The meatballs are virtually free on Thursday in comparison to the regular price.  Comes with a salad and a piece of garlic bread.  My husband and I are happy to share an order....although I like a little extra sauce on it.  The only things I love as much are the Eggplant Parmigiana......although this location does not offer it.  And the Big Chief--an Italian Beef sandwich...I ask for it on garlic bread with hot peppers...they bake it with a thick layer of mozzarella.....ooh its so good.  I have been eating at Rosati&#39;s since their original location  in Mount Prospect back when I was in High School.  They are a block away now in a different location and they do still serve Eggplant at that location.. Any day.. plain is 8.49, 10.48 with sausage or meatballs.  On Thursday price is 7.49 will include meatballs or sausage if you wish.  Oh....I wish I wish I wish
  Mary Eschenbrenner Zentz, Forest View &#39;72 

p.s. some locations offer it plain or with meat sauce (that&#39;s gravy to the Italians).  Rosati&#39;s has the same Lasagna Special on Thursdays. Prices may vary.

I don&#39;t think it will be around for long.

1. Your pan type pizzas need more time in the oven the first time around since it was very doughy.  Should have a bit of crunch on the bottom.  

2. Please fill sodas to the top, or allow customers to make their own sodas.  I get everyone wants to watch expenses, but there is no excuse for a half filled cup with the current profit margin you have on beverages.  

3. Please create a standard across the board for the size of your entrees.  The stromboli I purchased at another location was more than twice the size here, but the same cost.  If you want to stick with the smaller size, then it should be across all stores.  

4. Please have an employee walk thru and tidy up the dining area.  It&#39;s a bit filthy, and hard to locate a table that&#39;s clean

5. Thankfully I didn&#39;t want any pasta, but your spaghetti noodles were either dry to the point of appearing crunchy from too much time under the lamp, or mush from sitting in hot water under the lamp.  Think aldente!

Some if these changes will greatly improve customer satisfaction, and encourage repeat business.  I know you&#39;re not trying to be a fine Italian restaurant, but you should have better looking entrees than a Cici&#39;s."

Hadn&#39;t eaten all day and really just needed to get something in my stomach. Noticed Sbarro as I was about to walk out of the mall, so I stopped. This place has really gone downhill since I was in High School (or maybe my tastes have just developed??). The pizza was BLAH. I remember I used to actually get excited about getting a slice from Sbarro. It was the cool thing to do: walk around the mall, and then stop in for a slice with your friends. 

But now, the pizza is yuck. So cheap, and tasteless. The only saving grace was the breadsticks I&#39;d gotten on the side. Those were marginally better, at least they had flavor. 

$7.50 or so for a slice of pizza, two breadsticks, and a fountain drink. 

The guys working there seemed nice/friendly. The store seemed fairly clean. 

I just get the feeling that it&#39;s not all about the pizza anymore. Now they try and get you to buy all the sides: breadsticks, salads, pastas, dipping sauces, etc... 

JUST FOCUS ON THE PIZZA!"

Woodfield doesn&#39;t have a food court, but this wing is kind like their food court.  They have the typical food court players and some other places.  They even have a free sample vendor.  But back to Sbarro&#39;s.

It&#39;s set up like most Sbarro&#39;s.  Pick a tray and choose a pizza.  They take it and throw it in the oven for some warming.  Then you can add some other salad/sides/pasta etc.  Then throw in the drink and you&#39;re good to go.

I like the thinness of the crust on the pizzas and I think the warmup in the oven makes it nice and crispy.  They came out with a skinny slice which is like roasted veggies and cheese on a smaller piece of pizza.  But evidently it&#39;s delicious.  I haven&#39;t tried it, but this is what I&#39;ve heard.

There is pretty ample seating and you can always go walk around the mall and find a bench and eat there if you choose to."

To be completely honest it&#39;s a little dry, you should probably get it with the sauce, I usually only just ask for a little and then wish I had just a bit more. Still, it&#39;s a great carb fix. 

Their pizza is pretty decent for a fast food/in the mall kinda pizza place. I like their cheese the best even though I&#39;m normally a veggie or mushroom pizza girl. I don&#39;t care for their mushroom and after a second chance I&#39;ve given up on it.

They have real good pizza and amazing mouthwatering strombolis and stuffed pizza! The meal is a bit pricy. For the same price for a meal here, you can get an entire pizza from dominoes or little caesars. I only wrote this review here about my complaints about this place and how they use their persuasion and sneakiness to charge you more for your food.

I ordered a stuffed pizza slice.Ok. Then they ask me what sides do I want. Instead of asking me, &#34;would you like a side with that?&#34;, they ask me &#34;and what side do you want with the pizza?&#34; You will get charged more if you get a side. See how its worded? Its like almost pressuring you to get a side, and if you say you don&#39;t want one they look at you funny or become quiet and annoyed you didnt buy into their persuasion. Then the guy behind the counter gives me a little dipping sauce for the pizza. He hands it to me and says &#34;Here&#39;s some sauce for the pizza.&#34; You also get charged for this. I was expecting him to ask me if I wanted any sauce, but instead hands me the sauce like almost forcing me to take it. So not only do they make you get a side, they hand you something else so you get charged more and they make more money and you lose more money. Yes, I know how businesses work and they need to make money, but handing you stuff and not really giving you the option of saying yes or no to their food is really not respectful. Of course I could&#39;ve said &#34;No thats ok. I dont want a side&#34; or &#34;No I dont need sauce thanks.&#34; 

I hope this makes sense to those who read this. I am getting sick of them asking me that everytime I go get food there. Please ask me if I want any sides or sauce, etc. Ive never heard or seen any other restaurants or stores that do that, where they assume you are going to get something else with your main food or whatever it is you are purchasing. Dont hand me things and assume Im going to take them, and dont make funny faces or get pissy if I reject part of the food. The only thing that makes me come to this place is the taste of the food. Real real good. Other than that their service isnt the greatest and a bit forceful-ish. Maybe go to jimmy johns across for better faster service and a healthier alternative."

Breakfast dishes start around $12 a plate, but if you feel like that&#39;s not enough bang for your buck, you can shell out $19 for the buffet, which is about 50% underripe fruit. 

Our server was nowhere to be seen for 15 minutes after we were seated, and the hostess ended up getting our drinks for us. I don&#39;t know if he was new or something, but when he did show up, he brought an extra orange juice and took away one that was half drunk, even though we didn&#39;t want the new one. I also witnessed one of the other waiters grabbing an unused glass from our table, filling it with water, and giving it to another table. I could have licked that and they&#39;d have no idea! Also, it&#39;s been 15 minutes since I put in my food order (French toast) and the food and server are nowhere to be seen.

Avoid this place at all costs. There are a million better places to eat in this city.

Update: I received my food about five minutes later. I had the Crunchy Banana Bread French Toast; it was pretty good. We asked for a manager, who comped our meals for us. +1 star for at least not making us pay for this fiasco."

My colleague and I were all set to go try a different restaurant, rather than eating at Sam &amp; Harry&#39;s (we were staying at the Renaissance), but rain and a very long day made us opt to eat at the hotel rather than venturing out. I had eaten here before and knew it was good but pricey. 

Our server quickly greeted us and brought a plate with molasses- coated bread and crackers. We then ordered two different glasses of wine--a Pinot noir and Cabernet. The wine was drinkable. 

For appetizers I got a shrimp cocktail with jumbo shrimp and spicy cocktail sauce. My friend ordered the crab cakes. I thought the shrimp were good but didn&#39;t care much for the crab cakes...too much filler, not enough crab. 

The chef was making rounds and stopped by our table. We discussed different entrees at length and we both ended up ordering steak based on his recommendation. I got a grass-fed ribeye, which was way more meat than a person can eat, my friend got a NY Strip and we shared asparagus and a half order of mushrooms. We also ordered a second glass of wine. Our server mistakingly poured some of my wine in my friends glass and caught her mistake and then poured my friend&#39;s wine on top of it. So not only was I shorted wine, but my friend&#39;s wine was tainted. She didn&#39;t even bring out new glasses when we ordered different varietals. I mentioned that my wine was short and she did add a little more. 

We really enjoyed the meal but it was way too much food. Everything was good. I&#39;ll definitely eat here again when I stay at the Renaissance."

This place gets it.

We asked for music in the private room (which is in the center of the restaurant, primarily surrounded by glass) and what happened next blew us away. The restaurant manager brought out a nose stereo system that allows us to play our own music in the private room. If that&#39;s not customer service- I&#39;m not sure what is?!

So we jammed to 90&#39;s tunes while drinking Pinot noir (David Bruce, my favorite), and a fantastic Malbec (see photo). We ordered calamari, shrimp, and crab cakes along with the cheese/meat plate. 
In really wish I took a picture of the cheese plate- mustard, chutney, honey, bread, meats, three cheeses.. So much deliciousness. Definitely recommend.
Next came the soups and salads. That lobster bisque beats anything I&#39;ve ever tried elsewhere. Re-freaking-mark-able.
Then the steaks. 
You know that moment when you cut into the steak for the first time, and it unveils its juices and tender insides? That, plus an orgasmicly robust flavor, cooked to perfection. Why don&#39;t all steaks taste like this? Oh yeah, not all of them are from Sam and Harrys.
Jose, our server never let a glass run dry, nor a plate empty. He was always available when we needed him, but never over-cumbersome. The staff was a welcome addition to our evening, and made us feel welcome and cared for the entire night. 
Dessert was impeccable. The tiramisu was an incredible journey to Italy, and the apple crisp was pure decadence. The tort was a chocolate lovers fantasy and well polished with the raspberry sorbet, and just get the key-lime pie. Just do it, cause there aren&#39;t words to adequately convey its beautiful plating and it&#39;s refreshing tart-sweetness.
This is the second event I&#39;ve hosted here, and it won&#39;t be my last. 
Shout out to Patty, who accommodated the reservation and helped me create an evening that will live on in our hearts and bellies for a long time.
If you haven&#39;t experienced this place- treat yourself. It&#39;s worth every penny!
Thank you Sam and Harry&#39;s, for giving me an opportunity to give back to some amazing people in my life- it was an unforgettable night!"

From the first impression of event coordinator, Patty and Chef Rob months ago to final clean up after the event, we were impressed. Tasting of the appetizers that was provided, convinced us that there is no better place to hold our event. Again, Patty and Chef Rob were extremely helpful and attentive to us, the smallest details and suggestions were diligently noted by both of them. The food was simply excellent!

Working with Patty took a lot of stress off of my shoulders, she made everything simple and worry free. The set up of multiple decorations and many flower vases were exactly what I asked for. The final look was just perfect and definitely noted by us as well as ALL of our guest. The effort and thought put by Patty into our event was truly excellent! The staff during dinner was very attentive and patient with us, which was especially appreciated by guests who did not speak English. Chef Scott did an amazing job with all the dishes and we truly enjoyed him coming out to greet all the guests and ensure everything was good!

We truly appreciate the special treatment from the beginning to the very end!

Many of the guest already verbalized they will be coming back to the restaurant for date nights and we will definitely be recommending Sam and Harry&#39;s to friends and family for the events!

Since the wedding, we went back at least 3 times and every and each time we have excellent experience!

Congratulations on such an amazing team who made such a special event all that we could ask for! It was simply PERFECT!"

Then a waitress came over and asked us if we had a reservation-yes-then the bartender came back over and asked if we had a reservation and for our name again-yes. There was literally not a sole in this place at 7pm on a Saturday night and we kept getting questioned about our reservation!  Seriously?! That&#39;s when I should have headed for the door. 
We ordered the ribeye, filet and a couple of sides-mushrooms and brussel sprouts. The food was not good-the steaks were dry and overdone and the brussel sprouts were salty and didn&#39;t look freshly prepared. It was ridiculously expensive given the quality and certainly not worth it. The wine was good-that was about it."

To start I ordered the lobster bisque soup. I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again if I came here. It was more of a paste than soup and very much lacked in lobster. It had a brownish color to it and a thick texture that wasn&#39;t appetizing. 

For my meal I ordered the filet done medium rare, leaning more towards rare. It was done perfectly! Such a great flavor and so tender. Some of the people I was with had to send theirs back due to dry meat or it not being cooked well so I&#39;d say I was the lucky one! 

We ordered the asparagus, grits, mashed potatoes and mushrooms as sides. The mashed potatoes and grits were pretty boring and flavorless. The mashed potatoes actually tasted like a powder mix, not creamy as most mashed potatoes seem to be. The asparagus and mushrooms however were amazing! I swear the mushrooms were soaked in butter but i didn&#39;t care. They still tasted amazing. 

For dessert I ordered the soufflé. I had it once before the last time I stayed in this hotel so I was looking forward to it. It was absolutely amazing once again! It was lightly crusted on top with a creamy center. It came with a raspberry sorbet on the side which added a nice tart kick to it. My only complaint is that the waitress kept trying to make me get up to see how it was made. She even pulled my chair back while I was sitting in it. I explained to her that I&#39;ve had the soufflé before and I knew how they were made and I appreciated it but I wanted to stay sitting with my group. She kept hounding me practically making a scene. The person next to me told me to humor her and walk back to the kitchen with her. It was incredibly uncomfortable and I really disliked how she pulled me away from my group. 

Overall our waitress was a bit overwhelming with conversation and questions. Yet scarce when we needed drinks refreshed or plates removed. She recommended a few steaks to our table which turned out very dry and not to be the best of cut. She then went on the tell us it wasn&#39;t the &#34;season&#34; for that cut of steak. We were a bit confused why she would recommend it if she knew it wasn&#39;t &#34;in season.&#34; 

This is an ok place to eat if staying at the hotel. Make sure to order the filet and you&#39;re sure to have a good meal."

Which made me go: &#34;oh yeah, can we try this restaurant I once loved years ago? It&#39;s a no fail dinner out, I promise!!&#34;

...a hundred dollars later plus a shouting match during the ride home for suggesting a once-infinite-star-rated-restaurant- to only find that its now short-cut quality... Should&#39;ve left that memory where it was.

But Sam&amp;Harrys? I recall going here in &#39;07 and &#39;10.

I foresee this place going on for more decades to come and stronger.

Ordered the screi fish (black cod- if you like halibut, you&#39;ll love Screi just as much. Served in a bed of hollandaise-like cream sauce with fingerling tatoes.
Never had a fish so delicate, yet well seared and far from flaky-dry.

Wagyu short rib.
Friend says they &#34;Suvied&#34; the meat- French cooking technique where meat is sealed in a pack and bathed in water that heats gradually vs shocking the meat so it&#39;s perfect meat each time?

I don&#39;t know and somewhere in between her description of the technique, background noise suddenly muffled and it was just me and the wagyu..&#39;nuff said.

In Sum:

Clean, comfortable, crisp atmosphere and just the right tune in the background.

Girls: you don&#39;t have to keep powdering your nose or keep caking that paste on your face- lighting is just right!

Anyone who thinks Fogo is the best steakhouse?
How do you like your choice &#39;a meat? Salty and burnt or bleeding and fatty?

My first visit was with a party of four.  I ordered salmon and it was perfect!  Our waiter was excellent and we enjoyed a leisurely meal with excellent food and great service.

My second night was with a party of eleven!  I ordered a NY Strip steak and it was perfect!  Our wait staff was flawless and we all enjoyed an outstanding dining experience.

Sam &amp; Harry&#39;s is the type of place you&#39;d expect top-of-the-line ambiance, food, drink and service - we received it all both times.

5 stars - highly recommend."

$12, comes with fries. The hamburger patty i would bet comes from costco. I buy those same patties and im familiar with it. They cooked it so dry that its almost carboard like. But im hungry and had limited lunch time so i finished it. Fries are okay.
Their soup of the day is good though. Tomato bisque.
The greeter julie seem cold and aloof but the waitress julie did a good job.

Came here at peak dinner hour on a Monday, and it was pretty empty. There is something to be said, that a packed restaurant always makes your food taste even better - and part of me wishes that were the case. 

Luckily I didnt pay with my own money (work did) otherwise i&#39;d be underwhelmed with my meal. i got the dry aged Ribeye - which is my usual go-to steak cut - so i&#39;d ascertain myself to be connoisseur when it comes to ribeye steaks. Overall - cooked well, however underseasoned, good char on the outside, and good marbeling. The side of roasted garlic was dry, and looked to be mass roasted and refrigerated the night before. I got it with the yukon gold mashed potatoes which were very good. 

The carrot cake donuts were delish!

Corned. Beef. Hash. I was Harry Caray-ing it the whole time...&#34;Holy Cow!&#34; Imagine fresh chunks of tender brisket having a part with perfectly flavorful diced potatoes, a fluffy but not overly runny poached egg and a smattering of spices. It was perfection and beautifully done (not even remotely salty). I&#39;m still salivating over it. 

I&#39;ve also tried the blueberry pancakes and oatmeal, both of which are hearty and tasty. I can guarantee you that I&#39;ll crave that corned beef hash time and time again. Five stars for the corned beef hash and pleasant service, 3-4 stars for a fairly pricey hotel resto menu."

I ordered the Niman ranch ribeye with horseradish crust medium rare. The steak came out medium and it was dry and not very flavorful. Also got grilled asparagus with ham and it was super salty! Eck! It was also missing an egg on top which was described on the menu. Deserts were ok. Wine selection was excellent. I&#39;ve been to the one in DC and this suburban outpost just doesn&#39;t cut it.

I went with my family here for new years eve because it was the only place with availability but now I know why. 

We started with the lobster bisque based on some of the reviews on this site. It was the worse I had by far. Morton&#39;s has good lobster bisque don&#39;t bother here. 

We also had the prime rib we order it medium rare but rather than telling us up front that it was all cooked well we waited 45 min to get our meals just to be disappointed. We ate it only because it was to late to order anything else, it was dry as expected the dipping sauce was good. Want good prime rib try Lawry&#39;s downtown. 

The mash potatoes were salty and the vegetables over cooked. We also order stake it was plain but it was cooked to the right temperature. 

There is a door to the terrace that is not properly insulted so if you are dinning in the winter probably a good idea to ask to be seated far from it.

Walk in and the ambience is delightful. The live music was great, pleasant lighting, and modern decor. The night started great but went all downhill from there. 

We had 2 orders of short ribs, 2 steaks, Mac &amp; cheese, and mushroom. Everyone took their first cut into their dish and disappointment was on everyone&#39;s face. FAT. I have never seen so much fat and gristle on a piece of meat before. Half of my steak was in a pile to the side of my plate because it was inedible. For real?! For 38 bucks that steak should have been much better quality. Midway thru eating our subpar dinners we realized one of the side dishes never came out. Super. 

Waitress probably came by us about 5-6 times during our 2 hour dinner. She disappeared like a ninja every time she left our table. She did comp desserts. Good thing they were free because I would have been even more annoyed if we had to pay for the crappy bland desserts too. 

The only thing that made this evening better was the awkward fight a couple had across from us that lasted about an hour. I would like to thank them for their entertainment. 

I&#39;m not sure if I made it clear, but I will never be going back."

Worth a Trip: 1. Charming Ambiance - Tables nicely spaced with many romantic over-sized booths.  2. Stellar Begining - French onion soup perfect; bread basket extraordinary with crispy-cheesy flatbread and fresh &amp; crusty bread.

Deal Breakers: 1. Disappearing Server - sat too long with no drinks!  2. Temperature Fail - filet ordered medium plus served (past) well done.  Steak re-fired but served bloody... another wait and finally it&#39;s as requested!  3. Chilled seafood appetizer so water-logged, bar napkins needed to squeeze shellfish dry!  4. Sloppy Ending - steak &amp; seafood leftovers tossed ALL together in large Styrofoam container! 

Bottom Line: Every restaurant has a bad moment of two... how they correct it separates the great from good!

The Renaissance Convention Center/Hotel is really quite amazing. I&#39;ve been here for a couple wedding receptions and a conference, and the convention center part has been excellent!  I never stayed at the hotel, but based on the decor and, just, the &#34;newness&#34; of the place, it&#39;s pretty awesome and luxurious. It sorta feels weird that it&#39;s in Schaumburg. Yes, Woodfield Mall makes us classy, but not much else does.

So, having tried just about every steak joint in Schaumburg, I realized I never went to Sam &amp; Harry&#39;s. So, for Father&#39;s Day, I took my parents here. The dining area is very chic and expensive looking. There&#39;s even a table in the wine cellar. It also, strangely, had a very &#34;comfortable&#34; feel to it, like I could spend all day here! But, then it hit me, duh, it&#39;s the hotel restaurant. With Schaumburg offering quite a few options (and Morton&#39;s down the road), should you get a steak here?

DELMONICO
Since I always get a bone in ribeye anyway, it pleased me to know that the waitress suggested this (second to the NY Strip -- no thank you). Everything&#39;s a la carte here, so the steak comes out alone, that is, except for the half head of roasted garlic, which is extremely tempting might I add. 

The steak had a nice crust to it that you can feel while cutting, but strangely, it didn&#39;t live long enough to actually feel the texture while chewing. Definitely no David Burke&#39;s. However, regardless of the outer texture, this was probably the most tender AND juicy ribeye I&#39;ve ever had! Granted, it was a bit fatty, but hey, it was marbled very well and not in clumps, so kudos for picking the beef! And it wasn&#39;t just the first bite, it was the entire steak! 

So, why does this marblously (see what I did there?) textured steak get such low grades? ...Seasoning. Usually I give poor marks for meats that have too little seasoning, but this is one of those rare occurances where there was too much! The first bite of most ribeyes tends to be salty, because you end up getting a small chunk of fat. Same happened here, except the entire steak tasted like that! It was overly salty. It was so salty, I ate all of the asparagus to try to dilute it. It was a tough tradeoff because on one hand, the texture was so great but the saltiness was bordering painful! So, here&#39;s how I explain it. If you took 1 bite of the steak, you would say, &#34;Wow, that&#39;s good. It&#39;s just a tad on the salty side,&#34; which is what I said, but after you finish 22 oz of that, the saltiness builds and builds, to the point where I&#39;m not reaching for wine anymore, I&#39;m chugging ice water! So, unfortunately, that great texture was wasted. 

CALIMARI
Nothing special. Same ol&#39; same ol&#39;. However, that does kind of tell you how limited the rest of their appetizer menu was. Calamari doesn&#39;t vary that much from place to place, so it&#39;s my absolute last option of appetizer. Well, at Sam &amp; Harry&#39;s, it came down to that!

WEDGE SALAD
I had them split it 3 ways, since we were also splitting an appetizer. It says there&#39;s supposed to be a tomato vinaigrette, but I didn&#39;t taste it. In fact, there was hardly any on my plate. Just a 1/3 wedge of lettuce, some blue cheese, bacon bits, and onion strings. I guess those adequately provided the salt to make it an effective salad, but it oh well.

SIDES
The asparagus had some sauteed onions on top, which is a little different. I don&#39;t like raw onions, and even though they were cooked, they were still very oniony. Other than that, very normal. Creamed spinach was the same as anywhere else. The Potatoes Au Gratin had a nice little thing though, which was a layer of sweet potatoes. 

SAM &amp; HARRY = RENAISSANCE MEN?
Nah. The saltiness of the steak really ruined the sides too, because anything that even had a hint of salt, just seemed to taste salty after the steak. The most satisfying thing with the steak was my glass of ice water that had to be refilled like 6 times. I read a few other reviews and didn&#39;t see anyone else mention saltiness, so I guess that means mine was a fluke, right? However, no one else mentioned texture either, so I don&#39;t know what it was. 

I don&#39;t want to go back, but I&#39;m secretly hoping that somehow I&#39;ll be with a group that wants to go and try the steak (or I get gift card or some kind of reason to go). That texture was seriously new frontier for me, so I&#39;m hoping that they can recreate that, but only put the right amount of salt next time. 


OTHER NOTES
Oh, and they don&#39;t have a very extensive wine list. Their Cabernet Sauvignon selection is horrible. For a Father&#39;s Day at dinner time, I was also very surprised at how empty it was. Maybe 5 other tables at most around 6:15p.

Wedge + Calamari + 2 Delmonicos + 1 Shrimp Pasta Dish + 3 Sides + 1 Sorbet Trio + Bottle of terrible Shiraz + Tax/Tip = $255."

The overall quality of food and service IMO is not the same. We were a group of 25 who booked the center room on a non busy night and had no less than 4 servers who covered this room. I had to chase one of them to order a $17 martini as for some reason my side of the table was overlooked for drink orders. If she had later checked on my empty drink, I would have ordered a second $17 martini  to ease the disappointment from my cold, tough, unseasoned, undercooked steak. My wife&#39;s dinner was similar. With a check for 2 of $180 ( no wine 1 martini), the lousy food and spotty service is inexcusable. On a positive note, the onion soup is very good. I should have stopped there."

They were also giving out paper chef&#39;s hats and aprons to the kids as they made their way through the do-it-yourself pancake station.  This is where kids could &#34;decorate&#34; their own Mickey Mouse-shaped pancakes and cover them with a literal candy store&#39;s worth of sugary candy toppings (and some fruit, I think).  

At our table, the entrees we ordered were the Halibut, the Beef Wellington and the Lamb Chops.  The girls with the Halibut each took one bite and made the &#34;OMG, this is the most incredible Halibut ever&#34; face.  The lamb chops were very perfectly prepared at a medium rare.  They were both tender and juicy, and easily cut away from the bone.  The beef wellington had a very good overall flavor to it, but the meat texture was slightly tough to cut through and the portion was somewhat small.  

The dessert buffet offered an incredible selection of cakes, tarts, amazingly decadent chocolate peanut-butter pops, mango mousses, key lime bars, ginger carrot cakes and more.  My kids loaded up their plates with just about everything being offered there.  After all the candy at the pancake bar, this was becoming more like Halloween than Mother&#39;s Day for them, but they loved it. 

Our server was very friendly, fun and attentive to all our needs throughout the experience.  Our drinks were never empty and she was immediately all over every request we made to her.

Suffice it to say that we were all very full and pleasantly satisfied upon finishing the meal.  The final bill was rather hefty for the 5 of us, topping out at $190 (or $230 with tip).  But what the heck...it was Mother&#39;s Day after all.  Sometimes you just need to splurge when the moment calls for it.  Just seeing my wife enjoying her special day was more than worth it."

My experience was better. Service was fantastic (slow Thursday evening at 7 though could have an effect here) and I thought the menu was varied but concise enough not to confuse. Crab Cake appetizer was...OK  But my KC strip was very good and done perfectly. I thought they did an excellent job of explaining their meaning of temperature to us before ordering (their medium is more like other house&#39;s med rare) and as all good steakhouses should do asked us to cut into the center before the waiter left the table....simple stuff but so important....

I would go again ....probably try some seafood next time 

One thing to know for sure...Really pricey...dinner for two with 2 drinks and 3 glasses of Merlot ran over 300    was a little surprised at that number ..Felt like  200.00 to 225.00 quality but ...it was good 

FYI  

They had a nice  dining area for larger business group events that I will remember for upcoming opportunities.... It was in the center of the restaurant but done very cool...."

One of the freshest, tastiest oysters on the halfshell in Chicago.  The tiger shrimp, blue crab and king crab equally tasty.  The ribeye was just above par, but I&#39;ve had better elsewhere.
Service was good except for the waiter giving me a double take for requesting a  test of the wine before ordering a bottle.  The test that I asked for was also available by the glass so shouldn&#39;t have been a waste a bottle.. just his time."

I was surprised at how empty the restaurant was on a Friday evening (maybe four tables in the entire place).  The host asked us to wait in the bar area so the server on duty could &#39;catch up&#39;.  We were given an attitude by the host because we did not want to sit in the open traffic area that he picked for us.  With an empty restaurant, we figured we could get some alone time.  The high priced rib eye was over cooked and the mushrooms were also overcooked and were taken off our bill.  Probably not somewhere that I would go again - too many bad experiences........"

They had a simple wine list with decent prices by the glass or bottle. 

The oyster appetizer was delicious. I asked for tobasco sauce and the waitress came back with a few mini (the size of my pinkie nail) size bottles. Really? Does nobody there ask for tobasco sauce? Calamari appetizer was decent. Came with pretty good tarter sauce.

The fish of the day was halibut one of my favorites so I had to order it. For the the portion (looked about 4 ounces) the price was pretty steep but I hoped that the taste would make up for the lack of size. Sadly it was sliiiiightly overcooked. The cajun sirloin was ordered med to medium well but it came rare, blood dripping. We asked for it to be cooked longer because it was more rare then what we asked for and the waitress took it back nicely but never apologized for the mistake. Unfortunately when it came back cooked at a medium, the cajun seasoning on the steak was either too bland or overly seasoned depending on the bite. 

The side of mushrooms was pretty good but then again you can&#39;t really ruin that dish. I liked how they used a variety of mushrooms instead of the usual button mushrooms. 

All in all, the ambiance is nice but the food does not justify the prices."

Have dined here a couple of times before and loved the cuisine. This time 9/23 was the dreaded exception. Service was deplorable and two plates had to be sent back. Steak was the saving grace. Filet oscar was great. Cocktails took 20 minutes to arrive. Server did not know difference between single barrel and single malt. Apps came out staggered and one was forgotten entirely. Then the 30 minute gap to be served dinner which was only average at best. Now I know why on a Saturday they only had 6 tables filled. I would recommend going to Chicago Prime or Morton&#39;s rather than this place. At least they get the service and quality done well. Terribly disappointed and would not recommend.

Our group was in the glass room right smack in the middle of the whole restaurant and it was niiiiiice.   We had sort of a pre-set menu consisting of 4 courses and within those courses were 2-3 choices.  I ordered the crabcakes, the soup of the day (grilled tomato with shrimp bisque), the 12 ounce filet mignon, and for dessert, the chocolate dome.  We also had an appetizer platter which had breaded calamari and oysters, and large cocktail shrimp.  I was totally satisfied with everything I had.  Everything was so delicious, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

The service was very friendly and there was always someone there to help you.  I loved the room that we were in.....it had a cool ambience with glass walls and such a high ceiling.  The only inconvenience was the washroom location since you have to exit the restaurant to use the hotel washrooms.....but they were very cool!

I needed to fill 6 hours of my day starting at 8am while my boyfriend attended a conference being held at the hotel where Sam and Harry&#39;s is. I decided to start passing the time with a leisurely breakfast. Whooda thunk it would make my morning? 

I was sat at a table with plush couches for chairs. My server Stephen was AMAZING! The perfect example of kind, friendly yet professional service.
I told him I would be taking my time, and he was so accomodating; he had the perfect balance of fulfilling a need and leaving me contentedly reading my book. Really, one of the best servers I&#39;ve ever had, and that&#39;s saying a lot.

The food was also absolutely wonderful. I opted for the buffet, as it came with juice AND coffee (according to hotel prices, an$ 8 value). Expecting a typical hotel breakfast buffet, I was shocked to find made-to-order eggs (omlettes, over-however-you-pleased, even poached!), tender lox, waffles and french toast, even grits! The typical sausage, bacon and hashbrowns were also available, and they were all fresh. This buffet was worth the price even before I discovered what good quality it was. 

Yes, I got THAT excited about a hotel breakfast buffet."

I enjoyed the meal but myy friend had to send his sandwich order back because it was not fresh. We also had to wait for quite some time before our server came over. Not a great start when you are on limited time with a business lunch and possibly trying to seal a deal. 

I had cripsy rock shrimp for the first course which was excellent- there was some spicy yummy wasabi sauce drizzled over the shrimp. The Baked French Onion soup was great and my friend enjoyed it. I thought my grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich tasted great; excellent combo of gorgonzola, horseradish and onions, the bread was soft but slightly challenging to bite into as a sandwich, perhaps it could be sliced thinner or layered? Not easy to eat with your hands or for making a great impression when you are at a business lunch to pull out a hunk of meat from your bun. The large stack of onion rings were too much, I just had one but they were good. 

My friend worked in a well known fish restaurant, so he may be pickier than most, but his Scottish Salmon BLT was not up to par and he sent it back. He had been looking forward to trying this so it was disappointing. Perhaps they ordered lots of extra for the week in the kitchen...? Maybe some people would not have found it unacceptable however this place seems pretty high end and should only be serving the best, freshest food for their clientele. One would think...

Dessert was good, again my friend is a big fan of creme brulee and he said it was good but not fantastic. My milk chocolate mouse cake was very good. All in all the presentation of the food and decor of the restaurant was excellent, just some service and food quality issues to address. I would like to go back for dinner sometime, but want to be delighted with all my selections!"

We were seated right away, in a booth style made of two mustard overstuffed couches, overflowing with throw pillows.  I appreciated the seating arrangement, especially since most places only have couches/benches for one person, and the other person sits in a chair.  This seating was very comfortable for both of us.  
Decorating the walls are copies of the menus signed by various celebrities.  Nice touch, and not distracting to the overall décor.  Better than having a bunch of signed headshots like most restaurants do.  
There&#39;s a private room in the middle of the floor, surrounded by wine.  Very private, very fancy.  Will try to dine there next time.
We dined from a special menu in honor of Restaurant Week.
The bread basket had crusty baguettes, and amazing Cheese &amp; pepper crisps.  Salty from the cheese, and a little spicy from the pepper - I always look forward to those.  A small dish of green and black olives also came with the bread basket.  A nice, little nibbling amount.  My appetizer was a crab cake presented with shaved lemon, parsley and red onion.  The flavors blended nicely and had a pretty presentation.  Hubby had the lobster bisque.  Nice presentation in that the waiter poured the bisque around a small mound of lobster chunks tableside.  We each had a filet mignon, prepared Oscar-style.  Each bite was flavorful, cooked to my liking (med-rare) and the accompaniments blended nicely.
Maple ricotta donuts were okay, though.  Not what I was expecting.
Service was exceptional, as always, and should be for the price being paid.  Thankfully, we dined from the special Restaurant Week menu.  Otherwise, be prepared to pay $40-60/pp.  Be sure to get on their email list for promo emails &amp; specials.
Great service, great food, comfy, relaxing atmosphere; well worth the price."

I went there for the Mother&#39;s Day on Sunday with my wife and kids. The experience was pleasant, the food was good, and the restaurant is quite impressive. The reason I am giving it only three stars is twofold - way too expensive, and underimpressive food selection for a fancy restaurant like this on a Mother&#39;s Day brunch. I expected a lot more choices and some more exotic and/or European breakfast selections. What I got was a typical american brunch. I go to Germany quite often and it seems to me that even an average inexpensive german hotel delivers way better breakfast that this fancy restaurant. You get great selection of susages, hams, cheeses, bakery, coffees, teas, and fruits. What we got here was good perhaps even great but... limited. I like for my breakfast a freshly baked roll or bread with a tasty smoked ham or exotic yellow cheese and - I couldn&#39;t find it. I was stuck with your typical sausage link, scrambled eggs, bagels and cream cheese, and omelette (made to your liking though). Not what I was looking for in a fancy, expensive hotel.

For me, this place blends in well with the other steakhouses I&#39;ve experienced.  
Service was very good and attentive, great explanation and recommendations with diners questions. Food looked great when it came out and was cooked the way I wanted it, even though I know mater chefs hate to overcook steaks.  That is the way I like it so back off people who want me to eat it raw, eat your own steak and I&#39;ll eat mine OK buddy?
Cool layout of the restaurant with the fish bowl private room in the middle but I&#39;m sure some would be uncomfortable to sit in there.  Terrible bathroom situation with having to walk out the restaurant and down the hallway. If you are deep in the restaurant it&#39;s weird to have to walk out of the restaurant and then back in front of the glass wall and your table to get to the bathrooms. How about some frosted glass or something on the front?"

One of the guys with us is a chef and picked the place.  There were 11 of us.  We had a preset menu, which is fine with me, although I would have liked to see the full menu.  We had a good deal, I think it was about $50/person for the preset menu.

The food was great, the service was great, and I would definitely go back.  If you want to hear a little about our personal experience, keep reading...

To start I had the lobster bisque, which was amazing.  For the entree, the options were a filet, chicken, or fish.  Everyone had the filet, except me.  It looked damn good and I kinda regretted it at first, but I opted for the Ruby Red Trout.  Now, usually at nicer steakhouses, the portions aren&#39;t huge or incredibly filling.  They gave me two monsterous pieces of fish (maybe because no one else ordered it and they had extra? shit I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t ask questions!).  It was fantastic!  Personally, if it swam once, raw or cooked I&#39;ll eat it.  So I&#39;ll go for just about any seafood.  But this was really good.  A lot of the night is a bit hazy so I can&#39;t remember how the fish was prepared, but I enjoyed it.  It came with some fancy artistic potato apparatus thing that looked difficult to prepare but it was outstanding.

I sat next to the &#34;chef&#34; in the group, who actually knew some people that worked there, including the head chef who stopped by our table to say hello.  We ordered a few bottles of Conn Creek Cabernet, it was awesome.  I&#39;ve been to nice places and once in a while I will order a bottle, but I have to say the bottle presentation was perfect, very professional.  Our waiter did a great job.  The second bottle that came out (inspected by Mr. Chef), actually turned out to be corked.  When the waiter gave him the cork, you could see a red line down the side, which means air got into the bottle during storage.  We tasted it, and it was certainly not as good as the first bottle.  Personally, I would probably just keep it, but he sent it back.  The waiter was understanding and mentioned it to his manager, which was fine.  The manager came over to talk to us, we showed him the cork and he was very understanding about the situation and brought us a new bottle.  Same thing happened, but this one tasted better so we kept it.

I would definitely return, and I encourage you to check it out if you&#39;re in the area."

Village Grill is a cute, very clean and super friendly diner located just north of the tracks in downtown Arlington Heights.

I wish I could remember our server&#39;s name as she was terrific!  Friendly and personable she welcomed us to her section like we were a part of her family!  The menu has so many options it is hard to choose but I went with a basic BLT, my friend had the patty melt and another the club sandwich.  The food came up fast, was tasty and came served with these crinkle cut fries that reminded me of the kind my mom used to make in the oven.  You remember them . . the frozen ore ida ones . . .not on trend for today&#39;s foodies but they made me nostalgic just the same.

Tons of people around us were still on breakfast so we got to see the omelettes and pancakes go by and they looked just as good as our lunch entrees.

We were in and out and in no time with full tummies and only about $10 poorer.  And even though you are downtown, there is plentiful street parking.

It&#39;s never going to be gourmet food, but that&#39;s okay with me.  Any diner with clean menus (seriously, they looked like they had been printed that morning and dirty menus are a pet peeve of mine!) friendly welcoming service and decent food for a good price gets my visit any day.

See you at the Village Grill!"

I got the 2x2x2 for $8.25.  I&#39;ve been getting it forever.  Two scrambled eggs, 2 pieces of delicious French toast, 2 pieces of crispy bacon.  It&#39;s always awesome except today I got barely 1 scrambled egg.  Not the end of the world but my husband looked at it and said we should let them know.  That they&#39;d want to know.  Asked the manager &#34;Does this look like your usual 2 egg portion?&#34;  &#34;Yes, it does.&#34;  She left so fast I didn&#39;t get to point to my husband&#39;s 2x2x2 which had more eggs - a scant two scrambled. Maybe he had some of my portion.  Maybe they are using miniature eggs.  Whatever."

It was a busy Sunday morning with a wait, but in true diner fashion we were quickly seated in a roomy booth for our party if 2.5 (2 adults &amp; a 3 year old). Our waitress quickly greeted us &amp; drinks were delivered. Fresh squeezed oj &amp; coffee. The latter was ok... Juice was fresh, but not that day fresh. It was, however, priced well $3/large juice. My skillet was prepared with fresh veggies, not over cooked or oily. They offer gluten free toast with no up charge, that was a nice break. It wasn&#39;t smothered in cheese, that&#39;s a plus in my book. I could actually taste my food. Hash Browns were crispy. Staff checked on us throughly throughout our meal. In summary, fast delivery of well prepared fresh food &amp; service with a smile. We&#39;ll be back."

I ordered a three egg omelet with spinach, tomato, mushroom and onion. I asked for a side of avocado, but apparently that&#39;s too much too ask, because the waitress literally snorted at me and with a sneer told me they don&#39;t serve avocado. Ok, no prob, but she probably should have also told me that I&#39;d be better going to Jewel Osco across the street, because I think every ingredient in that whole restaurant comes out of a can. I don&#39;t expect healthy recipes at a diner, but I do expect fresh ingredients at the least.

The spinach and mushrooms in my omelet were both soggy and brown, with weird after tastes, I think they were both out of a can. The tomatoes were not ripe and had edges of white and green. The eggs had no taste whatsoever, no matter how much I tried, I just couldn&#39;t finish my meal. I would give this place negative stars if I could."

The only issue is that it&#39;s just not a good value.  The food is your normal diner menu, and the atmosphere/staff go a long way to make you feel at home.

I got my hopes up at finally finding a really good breakfast place.  I should not have.  It was not.

The place itself has a nice, quiet, laid back feel to it.  It seems like the type of place where you could sit down and just drink coffee all day.  There was no rush of people, so there was no rush for the staff to be turning your table over to get you out the door.  That is why I am giving it two stars.  The food was mediocre at best.

My first complaint was the ham steak.  The menu says off the bone ham.  Now when I read that I am expecting a large bone-in ham in the kitchen where they carve off slices of it.  This looked like it was one of those round ham-steaks that you get in the grocery store.  Technically it was ham, but it did not taste like any off the bone ham I had ever had before.  Well, any except the prepackaged ones you get at the grocery store.  The ham also had a chemical taste too it, like it had been cooked on a grill that had not had all the soap washed off it it.  It was quite disgusting.   I could have overlooked it being a ham steak and not true off the bone ham, but it was just too damned disgusting.

My friend had the biscuits and gravy, and the gravy had the same chemical taste to it.  As did the bacon.  The sausage links did not have that chemical taste to it.  But they did not taste like sausage, either.  I am not sure what they tasted like.  It was kind of like someone had just stuffed ground meat into a casing and had forgotten to include the spices.  It was meat.  That is about the best I can say about it.

The corned beef hash was OK, but not 5-star worthy.  Nor 4 or 3 star worthy.  It was definitely better than the canned hash that so many places serve, but that is not really saying much.  I give the hash by itself 2 stars.  But, the potatoes are worth -1 stars.  Now, I love shaved hash browns.  It is my favorite style of cutting/preparing potatoes for frying up to go with your breakfast.  These had no flavor to them.  Bland.  Dull.  Boring.  Just like my 11th grade history text book.  At least my history book had useful information in it.  The only message these hash browns sent was &#34;Stop eating me.&#34;  Which I did.  

Now on to the eggs.  Three eggs came with the hash browns.  I like my eggs sunny side up, which these eggs were.  I do not, however, like eggs where the bottom is rubbery and you have to grind back and forth with the edge of your fork to cut them, which these eggs were.  I do get it that sunny side up eggs require a bit of skill to cook just right, and I would hope that the owner/cook would have mastered the art after all the years this place has been in business.  My hopes were seriously disappointed today, from start to finish. 

Except the staff.  They were all very friendly.  But, I do not pay for friendly staff.  That should be the default setting in every establishment.  I pay for good food.  This was not good food.

I will not be returning to this place."

We went on a Sunday morning and it was only 1/4 full of customers. Not a good sign, but we sat down anyway. I ordered the Mexican omelette with chorizo. It was mediocre at best and the &#34;chorizo&#34; did not taste authentic, not spicy enough and bland. The hash browns were ok, but not crispy enough for me, and again, bland. Even the coffee was bland, though at least it was strong and good with breakfast food. The staff were fine though our waitress seemed a little odd.

My crepes were pretty floppy and spongy and the filling (strawberries) were likely unfrozen at the last minute. Thus, I didn&#39;t find any wow factor in my breakfast. 

That being said, there are some redeeming qualities about this locally run diner. Hubs&#39; omelette was giant and super affordable, the interior, while a bit dated, was clean, and the service was friendly and very, very fast. Our food came out in less than 10 minutes when we visited before the church crowd on a Sunday morning. 

I&#39;d give Village Grill another go, but I&#39;d opt for something other than crepes next time...probably something eggy and cheesy."

I had their ham &amp; cheddar cheese omelet with Greek toast and coffee. The best thing was the coffee (priced at $2.19 for a medium sized take out cup). The food had an unpleasant undertaste. I wonder when they last cleaned their grill. The hash brown potatoes were bland and mushy. The omelet was good sized but did not taste fresh. The cheese tasted like American.

The toast was the worst. It was either stale or had been frozen (or both). Something is definitely wrong when I&#39;m unable to finish a breakfast meal after not eating for 13 hours.

There are many good alternatives for breakfast in this area. I do not recommend this place"

I tend to alternate between the house-made corned beef hash and the ham with eggs, and both are delicious. The standard breakfast order includes three eggs instead of the usual two. Eating at the counter is a nice option when eating alone.

- Waitresses are under &#34;model contracts&#34; but I am not sure what modeling agency would take them.
- Unequal attention given to customers
- Manager is useless, never walks around except to drop off food
- 21 tvs in eyeshot and only 1 has Cubs game on...literally 8 of them have truck racing.
- Chef loves adding salt to everything (need to ask for no salt or else you will be sending it back)

Below is my recent visit:
I used to work right down the road so this place was convenient for lunch or an after work beer (or three).  So now that I work further away I thought it was time to catch up with my buddy at the old &#34;watering hole&#34;.  This is still definitely the best place that sells Guinness with the Irish theme.  So on a Thursday night there is a half full parking lot but as I walk in there are no 2 chairs by the bar.  So I opted to grab a beer in a high top next to the bar and wait for chairs to open as my buddy will be coming in about 20-30 mins.  I think it was Alex that was my server, not the &#34;typical&#34; tilt girl as she is short and honestly not attractive but she has been there for a while and I&#39;d rather get good service then anything else.  So I told her that I will be joining the bar when it becomes open...she appreciate being let know then I ask for my drink.  I know it might be sacrilege to ask for Guinness to be poured quickly and have it cascading at my table but that&#39;s the way I ask for it and she had no idea what I was talking about.  So when my beer came to my table it was &#34;flat&#34; and she told me the bartender poured it the way I like it (she didn&#39;t mention that it took her 5 minutes to pick up the beer and bring it to me).  I took one sip and it didn&#39;t taste right (possibly psychological) so I told her to take it back and to get me the check. So after about 10 minutes the beer with tax was a bit over $7.50 for a sip.  I just sat there, watched the Cubs game on the 1 tv that was hard to see and met my buddy at Hooters!"

The service was easy on the eyes and not so good at the service part.  Very friendly, not very attentive, and slow.   

I had a burger that was actually quite good.  Good enough to bump up, what would otherwise be a three star review.  I order the burger medium and it can out medium.  It was juicy and flavorful.  The fries where crisp and hot.

The only thing I wanted off of the appetizer section was the Spinach Artichoke Dip w/ chips. To my surprise, our waitress Sammi, who btw was fantastic, tells me out of all the appetizers, that&#39;s the only they no longer carry! (What...?! Then why is still on the menu? Or at least crossed off?) Wasn&#39;t entirely happy about that, but it&#39;s okay, I was going to eventually get it for free. Nothing else caught my eye, so along with the boys we made an executive decision, and went with the TK Irish Nachos. Which were pretty good actually.

For my meal I got the Spicy southwest chicken salad, and that was real good! And huge too! I really liked the spicy southwest dressing that&#39;s on it, along with the grilled chicken, tortilla chips, the jack and cheddar cheeses and pico de gallo. 

Overall, excellent service, and great food!"

Unfortunately, I could not come up with anything. So, let&#39;s get down to business.

We sampled a few of the craft beers on tap. For food, we tried a sampling of the hot wings. And, for dinner we each had burgers. I would say, compared to other restaurants of the same type, the food was pretty good. The wings were okay - I thought the sauce was good, but the wings could have been cooked a little more thoroughly. The burger was excellent. I was not as happy with the fries, but can&#39;t put my finger on exactly what was wrong. After eating all that food and drinking all of that beer, desert was out of the question.

The servers are very pleasant. I did notice that they were more attentive to some customers than others. My initial thought was that these customers were more in the age range of the servers. But, after watching, I think they must be regular customers. It was a little disappointing that the servers did spend more time with some customers, and less with others (like us). As some others said in their reviews, the servers are kind of &#34;eye candy&#34;."

Occasionally I let the hubs win and he drags me down to such places like tilted kilt. Gotta nip that in the bud. Well I dont have very good words to say, dont have very bad words either. The outfits served the joint well as 98 percent of the customers were middle aged males with beer bellies drooling over semi attractive, semi naked girls. Dont get me wrong I am not judging the place, after all it is capitalism. The owner of TK has to make his money somehow. Just not sure its my cup of tea. 
They have a lot of beers on tap and a large menu. I ordered a wrap with veggies and hubby got chicken tenders with fries. My wrap sucked but the veggies,  even though they were cold, were delicious. The chicken tenders were great as well. Oh yea, I reached. The bartender noticed that I didnt eat the wrap so she took it off the bill, was really nice of her and totally unnecessary.  Needless to say appreciated.  
Gotta say, many people are right. The service was great. All three of the bartenders were very attentive and made sure everything was alright.

The cheesteak sandwich was really good and I loved the coleslaw too.  The second time I went with chopped salad which had lots of goodies.  The only downside to the salad was it had deli type turkey instead of chunks of turkey.

CONSTANT vigilance by the bartender to keep beverages refilled and nice chit chat.

We called Monday to reserve a table, called again to confirm Thursday. Received a call Friday from your restaurant as confirmation that we&#39;d be there. We arrived on time at 7. They seated us with the Black Hawks game on, had to be moved to the room the UFC fight is being shown in. Even though we told them, we were coming to reserve a spot able for the fight: Had drinks, appetizers, our meal, ordered more drinks and went outside to smoke a cigarette at 9:45. (Which we did tell our server Tammi that we&#39;d be back) We came back expecting our drinks at our table and there was two men sitting there. Our table was given away, the one we reserved! There were still two title fights we were waiting to watch. My husband was pissed and told the waitress to just check us out. I talked to the manager, told her we will not be back. Her response was, &#34;okay, I&#39;m sorry&#34;. Our bill was $133, we weren&#39;t finished yet. We could&#39;ve have bought more drinks in that next few hours. The waitress didn&#39;t do her job at making sure her table wasn&#39;t taken, the manager didn&#39;t care. Sammi was our server. Jennifer and Anninetta were the managers tonight. 
Have you ever heard the business saying - you satisfy 1 customer and they will tell 1 friend. You do bad serve to customer and they will tell 5. 
My husband is a dentist, he will be sure to do all he can from sending patients to go to the tilted kilt. 
We have been good, loyal, high paying customers for your events. We will not be back. Do u give tables away before they are given the check?? Were we supposed to just walk out expecting we got the grand prize of a free meal? We wanted to watch the fight! No more tables, oops. The least that could&#39;ve been done was to politely tell the men that they made a mistake (by giving away a reserved tabe) and need to reseat you and have the manager act like she cared that we weren&#39;t doing business there again. BTW my husband is a dentist, which means he&#39;s spending good money at your establishment and is a customer worth keeping.

Atmosphere: bar/restaurant setting, dim lit..many male customers, loud (men can get loud..with some alcohol...)..I wouldn&#39;t bring kids here nor say it&#39;s that family friendly...

Food: 
-bbq bacon cheeseburger which comes with regular fries at $10.99 (upgrade/upcharge if you want any fries other than regular fries):tasted delicious and meat was cooked just as I wanted it..huge burger so it&#39;s definitely filling and if you aren&#39;t a big eater...you&#39;ll have leftovers 
-sweet potato fries:  tasted just like sweet potato fries and looked like crinkled sweet potato fries...gave a good amount of fries...just wish the fries were actually hot...they were a little warm as if it was sitting on the plate waiting for the burger to fish cooking..
- garlic (parmesan) fries: tasted good, but a little dry and also wish it was hot or more fresh...the garlic Parmesan seasoning was just right that you can eat it without ketchup and it&#39;ll be fine...

Customer service: great!!! our waitress, Allyssa, even sat down and chatted with us for a little (definitely a different customer service approach)..and she also checked up on us often to make sure that things were going well...the manager dropped by our table too and asked us how things were....

Parking: free parking at restaurant parking lot...plenty of spots for parking!

Costs: to be exact..ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries (in place of regular fries) and the total with tax was $13.88...so with 20% tip..it&#39;ll estimate to around a little over $16..or just pay $17...not sure if it&#39;s a better deal to go to red robin and pay around the same amount while getting bottomless fries...if you are a fry lover that is...

I work at a software company full of guys who have anxiously been awaiting the grand opening today. We got there right at opening around 11 and were greeted by tons of hot girls! Tilted Kilt girls are way hotter then Hooters girls. My whole lunch crew agreed we won&#39;t be going back to Hooters. The girls were all super friendly there and they paid me attention to, even though I was a lady. :)

Our waitress Silvia was super nice, sat with us a bit and chatted, plus of course super hot! I had to remind myself to keep my eyes on her eyes the whole time! 

Aside from the girls all being great here, the food is very tasty as well. The Parmesan fries are nummy and the BBQ Bacon Burger I got was awesome as well.

Great service, great food, hot girls...will definitely be back soon! My coworkers are saying we&#39;re going Thursday this week again for a couple fellas that missed out. :p"

Irish Stew: AMAZING, homey and delicious

Meatloaf Sandwich: Tastey, LOVED the barbecue sauce

For the other parts of the review; I ordered Fish and Chips with fries.  Good on them for having malt vinegar like they should.  After eating it, I felt heavy.  Like really heavy.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but this never happened to me in the UK.  Maybe its the batter or something.

They also run deals on shots of tequila and beer or something I&#39;m not even sure."

So far I have tried Hooters (Schaumburg), Buffalo Wild Wings (Hoffman Estates) and now Tilted Kilt (Schaumburg).

I showed up yesterday for lunch and had the wings here...first off, I think the price is high for the quantity of wings served.  $10 for 7 wings?  I asked the waitress how many came to an order and she told me they do it by weight.   

I asked for the spicy wings and I was unimpressed with the (lack of) heat - in addition to that, the wings themselves were not crispy at all.

The highlight of the visit were the parmesan garlic fries that she (highly) recommended.  They were Delicious!  

But again it was too expensive here.  $20 (before tip) for 7 (mediocre) wings, fries and a glass of beer?  I&#39;ll pass..

I really would like rate this as a 1.5 but I&#39;ll give them the additional half star for the pretty ladies  who work here..."

It&#39;s OK - not a wow, but it&#39;ll do. They have a great selection of beers, but they are among the pricier places for beer too. I ordered a cheeseburger and it had a nice charbroiled taste, came with some french fries that were fair. I could have upgraded to garlic fries but didn&#39;t feel like paying extra for them. 

My bartender was pleasant and attentive - though the bar only had a handful of people at it with two bartenders to take care of us. Another customer sitting nearby ordered fish and chips - they looked good. Maybe on my next visit I&#39;ll ask the server for their recommendation and see what that brings.

This is not really my type of place but of friend of mine wanted to go so I went along with it.  I expected terrible service, a poor and overpriced beer list, bad food, and all that jazz for a view of scantily clad women.  It was actually quite the opposite.  The beer list was not all that bad, at least they had Chainbreaker on tap so that was good enough for me.  All I got to eat was nachos which were solid, the food I did see look good but a bit over priced.  However, the women were scantily clad....

The service was excellent; they were on top of filling beers, bringing out water, and the food came out super quick.  To my shock there was a dude behind the bar - sporting a kilt and beard, flipping glasses&#39;n&#39;sh*t.  Yes, some the women working looked rather young and were half dressed but since they made the guy wear a kilt I gained a bit more respect TK.  Overall, It was better then any of the other places of this nature (granted I do not frequent them).  I would never suggest going here but if invited again I would happily show up, it is not my place and it never will be but for what it is supposed to be it exceeded my expectations.

Think this one in Schaumburg is fairly new because I&#39;ve never seen it before.  It lies on the outer OUTER skirts of the mall and is a bit hidden.

Stella and chicken wings.  Those two things right there added a many digits to our bill.  The service (as packed as it was) surprisingly good!  So was the food!  I can&#39;t even remember the types of wings but we did get these loaded fries which were hard to share, they were so good.

Last night my fellow coworkers and I got to have a night on the town on our boss. We come from different parts of the U.S. (San Antonio, TX / Austin, TX / Salt Lake City, UT / Appleton, WI / Portland OR). We decided on something fairly close because Alcohol would be involved. The staff at TK was very very nice and did there absolute best to help out such a big party in a timely fashion. We had ordered 2 apps, &#34;Fried Calamari&#34; and &#34;Pub Pretzels&#34;. Both were amazing. I can&#39;t stand seafood but I have always had a love affair with Calamari and this stuff was fried amazingly. Love pretzels and I love the way the Beer Cheese tasted. I ordered a New York Strip (Medium Rare). Very good steak, but unfortunately it came to me as a more Medium steak. It was free, so no big deal. All in all, I enjoyed TK and I will come again.

I&#39;m torn on how to properly rate this place.
It was fun to watch 3 sporting events at once while drinking large beers (I don&#39;t think small is an option). 
My buffalo chicken tender wrap was delicious and had the right amount of kick (despite the waitress making fun of me for ordering it).

I hate to use the phrase, &#34;it is what it is,&#34; but that&#39;s how this place was. It&#39;s waitresses with really low cut shirts, boobs out as far as possible, with beer and sports. 

It almost became uncomfortable but survived. 
The biggest negative was being called Skippy for some apparent reason throughout the meal. Next time I&#39;ll actually skip to and from places to deserve the name.

Will I go back? Eee...not if there&#39;s another bar showing the same thing. I can&#39;t see the wife saying, &#34;you know where we should go...that place will all that cleavage...that&#39;ll be fun...&#34;"

My first issue is that every table is reserved, but no one sitting anywhere.  We sat at our table, and for the next hour the restaurant that was technically booked was empty.

We ordered nachos fully loaded that we had to send back 3 times to get it right. When I asked to speak with a manager a girl came and said there is no manager but that she was acting manager at the moment.

The chicken fried steak that was ordered came out almost immediately, and lukewarm. No chance that it could have been cooked in that time. It had to be pre-made.

The prices on the menu have been gradually rising, and the quality of the food falling. 

As a place to watch a game... fine. You might find yourself in an empty room with a bunch of reserved tables, but there are tons of TVs.

Tilted Kilt is in the same category as Hooters, and Brickhouse Tavern.  What will ultimately make or break this, or any type of restaurant will always be the food and service.  

Don&#39;t get me wrong, this place is obviously a glorified &#34;man-cave&#34; with the  attractive waitresses, and enough TVs to suppress your ADD.  We went here on a Thursday night, so it wasn&#39;t too crowded.

Obviously it was a dude fest in there, but there was some ladies sprinkled in the house.  I also noticed that the servers will sit next to you and chat up the customers.  If you are a 40 year old dude who still lives with your parents, this might be uncomfortable, but I thought it was a nice touch.

Our server Trina was great, she reminded me of Emma Stone (google it people).  I had questions about some beers they had on tap, and she honestly didn&#39;t know the answer, but she found out.  I appreciate the little things like that.

We ordered the Garlic Parm fries which was pretty damn good.  I went with the standard bacon cheeseburger which was plenty robust and tasty.  We men are simple creatures.  Put good food and beer in our face, and we tend to be happy.  Now add awesome service by an Emma Stone doppelganger, and you got yourself a winner!!

I shall return on many occasion, as this place will be a great spot to watch sports.  Also, I wish Trina luck on her Halloween costume...and I hope she doesn&#39;t end up on Tosh.O."

For being rather expensive in terms of everything they should really be doing better. Beer tastes fine, no dirty taps or anything but it&#39;s far too expensive for even the lowest end of domestic brews.  

The service seems to vary by patron. If you look like a fat old man who is willing to sign his inheritance over to any girl who will be nice to him -- you will get first class service.If you&#39;re interested in watching some sports, eating, and not flirting back with the waitresses then you might be a bit put off.  I don&#39;t blame the girls for wanting to make the most money possible but it&#39;s too polarizing and noticeable. There needs to be a better balance. 

For the price the food is complete junk. Deep fried out of laziness. I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;ve only eaten here three times but of those I&#39;ve tried different items each time and none of them really did anything for me aside from taste bad. My friends eating with me weren&#39;t overly impressed with their dishes as well.

All but one experience (surprisingly at Schaumburg...which I&#39;d rate the lowest of those in the area) has ranged from &#34;lack luster&#34; to &#34;...can you please just bring the check?&#34; (Best server was acute little brunette, hair uniform length cut to her chin, stated to live in the Elgin area...can&#39;t remember her name for the life of me - though they don&#39;t use their real names anyways).

My first visit, I was accompanied by a close friend of mine, whom I see as a non-biological sister.  While the view was fun, the food was good... our table was largely ignored.  I understand that there are better tips to be made from a table of skunk-drunk guys...but I don&#39;t feel its reason enough to make 3 trips (beer, food, check) to my table.

Since then,  I&#39;ve had mixed experiences.  Some better than others, but largely -  its felt like the servers are either trying to work me and my guy-friend over for tips, are forced to sit with the clients, or just...dare I say it?  Oh I dare...  Were hired because they fit in the uniform.

If you feel like playing roulette with your dining experience - and don&#39;t mind sub-standard service...but wish to gawk at 19-20something year old females in school girl-esque uniforms....awesome.  If you want to get your food, hot, and timely... you may be best off looking elsewhere."

That&#39;s a real problem because more often than not I&#39;ll choose to stop here for a game before a workout and honestly, that&#39;s sort of counter-productive.

The crew is attentive and the atmosphere is fun. I haven&#39;t had a bad meal here. The combo nachos are probably the best deal on the menu. Ask for Jaimie or Masha because, well, they&#39;re kooky in a good way. Oh, and get there way early if you plan to find seating during Bears game days. Otherwise, you might end up going to the gym."

I&#39;ve visited their restaurants in the Phoenix / Scottsdale before, but had not visited this location. I was just looking for a beer or two and some healthy food to take back to my room, so I plopped down at the enormous bar and ordered a Guinness. The bar service was excellent - fun and friendly - and attentive. The beer was great and the food was, too. I decided to add an extra chicken breast to my salad, and the server said, &#34;No problem - that&#39;s the way I order it, too.&#34; Small thing, but a good way to make the customer feel comfortable. 

I&#39;m apparently showing my age because I wasn&#39;t really impressed or unimpressed with the cleavage show. One of the bartenders was a dude, and he did a great job (without showing cleavage, as I recall); one of the others was female, but the thing I remember the most was how friendly she was. I must be getting old! Anyway, it was a nice experience and I&#39;ll be back if I&#39;m in the neighborhood again!"

I ordered the:
Spicy black bean veggie wrap: spinach tortilla and black bean, corn and tomato combination, lettuce, marinated veggies, cheddar and Jack cheese and spicy Cheyenne ranch sauce and came with sweet potato fries. Probably one of the best wraps I have had. 

Had two drinks; 
-purple haze: three olives grape vodka, peach schnapps, blue curaçao, sweet and sour, sprite and cranberry juice. Could have been stronger but was great still.

Celtic crush: three olives orange vodka, peach schnapps, triple sec, sweet and sour and orange juice. Great drink.

As for the waitresses took us forever to track her down at times. Sometimes we had to grab someone else when we needed something. It is very annoying because the girls will sit at the tables and chat with the customers for a very lengthy time period, leaving the rest of their customers hanging. Oh and the girls dress pretty slutty, so I guess the guys may give them a better review than me."

It might have helped that my expectations were ground-scraping low, but I think I might actually go back sometime.

Walking in, I expected this to be just like Hooters--no good options for a meatless meal, crappy beer, poor service, a trashy clientele, and an environment that&#39;s generally hostile to women. I was wrong!

While we showed up here hoping to catch an MMA fight after three places in a row didn&#39;t have it (even Wild Bull, where we called ahead and were told it was on!), and sadly, Tilted Kilt didn&#39;t have it, either. Since we were hungry and tired of looking, we accepted that we would not get to see the fight and took a seat at the bar. A total of three bartenders helped us throughout the evening, ensuring that we didn&#39;t have to wait for anything while we were there. The hostess greeted us and said goodbye when we left, and the bar was clean when we sat down plus was being cleaned for the next customers as we walked out the door. I didn&#39;t feel at all like the staff wasn&#39;t paying attention to me because I&#39;m not the target demographic (men who will tip extra if you chat with them and touch them on the arm). 

I also didn&#39;t feel like I did when I for some insane reason met a friend at Hooters, as if I&#39;m unwelcome because the trashy dudes at the next table feel uncomfortable talking about all the things they want to do to &#34;the bitches&#34; when a non-staff woman is within earshot and I&#39;m somehow cramping their style. Er, &#34;style&#34;--apparently, at Hooters this means cut-off jeans where you can see the pockets hanging out and a ketchup-stained t-shirt. At Tilted Kilt, a lot of the customers were dressed like normal people or, like us, apparently showed up hoping to see the fight, based on their Affliction tees.

I thought my food was a little salty, plus they overcharged for a little bit of guac to go with the chips and salsa. Still, it was much better than I expected, and I was glad to have real options to choose from on the menu. The beer is where they really shine, though. They have over a dozen beers on draft, including some craft brews like Matilda. Although I knew more about beer than the bartenders (yes, even the male ones), I was still glad it was there. It&#39;s pretty unusual to find a chain restaurant with such a large beer selection, especially in this touristy part of Schaumburg.

Also, Tilted Kilt is set up so that you can see a TV from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant. Of course, you can also see short-skirt-clad ladies from anywhere in the restaurant (duh). I like that they male employees have to wear kilts too (although thankfully theirs cover more skin). It&#39;s probably good for employee solidarity for everyone to have cold legs."

Went to this location with my wife to watch the Sugar Bow. Walked in the door to the hostess stand only to have the hostess literally walk around us to hug some 19y/o boys and seat them. She comes back to the stand and does it again. We finally get seated, order wings, and they come out nasty. I am guessing because the wings are grilled that at some point they are baked to give em&#39; a head start. These wings tasted as if they were baked two days before and it was like eating cold-seasoned cardboard. Fortunately, Danielle noticed our displeasure. We were about to leave before the 1st quarter even ended but she took 1/2 off the Wings and brought us a round of the Miller Lites. She made it point to look and speak to my wife first and unlike most of the waitresses, she was working hard not just flirting with the lil&#39; boys (do they even check ID at this location)?
I was whining a bit here but Danielle (Bella) worked hard and earned us back for at least another try. Which we did, for the Lions/Saints playoff game and the group of six of us dropped a nice 3 bills and loved every minute of her service. The next obstacle, trying a new waitress to see if management has fixed the little kiddie like mistakes and flirts. I will update this review when I try it again to let you know if the managers put business in front of impressing the pretty young girls."

It is VERY loud, but since we were there when a Hockey Game was on the first night and when a Bulls game was on the second night I&#39;m not surprised.

Some of the sausage slices were ok . But other pieces were definitely bad. probably sitting in the deep freezer for ages ! Didn&#39;t eat any further .

Over all, it was a good dinner, with fantastic service and great ambiance!"

The drinks are impressive and authentic, they don&#39;t skimp on alcohol yet they still have an excellent taste. I also was pleasantly surprised at how hearty their tacos were- two or three as an entree should do the trick! Can&#39;t wait to try fajitas next time."

It is in the Arboretum shopping center, next to a cinema. 

Mago is SO FLIPPIN GOOD! I opted to start out with the table side guacamole. It is $10, and it is worth every penny. It is made to your liking right in front of you, and the serving size is huge! It goes great with the complimentary chips and flight of delicious salsas. 

The gluten free options are listed right on the main menu, and there are plenty of them! I had 3 of the tacos, chicken, and they went so well with the tableside guac. 

Mago has Meriachis, and if you go on your birthday, they will serenade you at your table, and you get a free sombraro and chocolate pudding. 

I can&#39;t wait to go back to Mago, it is an absolutely delightful cantina. Take your family and friends out for a phenomenal night here, enjoy the bar and the wonderful food!"

Good food, relax ambiance (they have outdoor seating).  I was with my husband and as soon as we sat down a basket of nachos was served in our table.  I didn&#39;t notice how long it took for our food to be served  because I enjoyed the nachos and the three types of dips that we were served with. My husband and I shared the chicken tamales which I thought was really good.  I also had the skirt steak burrito,  it was good too,  but nothing really special if I would compare it to other Mexican restaurants serving burrito. My husband had the shrimp tacos which according to him was really good,  too.  I ordered tequila margarita (on the rocks) and I loved it, very refreshing!"

First off, the chips were fresh and warm. The sauce were amazing- especially the spicy peanut sauce and the green (salsa?).

I ordered the Pechuga Azteca. The dish was delicious but a bit too salty.

My colleagues had ordered burritos and they looked quite big. Apparently it tasted good as well.

They have these funny decorations. Skulls filled with alcohol I guess. I was tempted to order one... but then this was a business meet and yeah.. no I was going to do that hah"

I was pleasant,y surprised how original their menu is. I mean, let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s Mexican, we&#39;re talking cheese, tortilla, retried beans, and some type of meat...that&#39;s pretty much Mexican. The fact that Rick Bayliss (nice guy, don&#39;t get me wrong), has made a living beyond the Taco Bell menu and a drive they is a miracle to me.

So, I tried the empanadas. They were absolutely fantastic. They were not greasy and the filling was full of flavor, Mickey seasoned meat and shrimp, and it was drizzled with a sour cream infused with something. They were almost an entire meal and I did end up taking my jibarito home. 

The jibarito was very nice, slightly above average and a very simple sandwich of beef, mayo, lettuce and tomato on a fried plantain.

The chips were excellent, and their sauces/salsas were well flavored  recipes with 3 heat intensities. They are creamy and you taste more than just tomatoes and jalapeños.

Folks if you ever see a Mexican meal review with more than 3 stars, don&#39;t trust it. Mexican food is never that good, same goes for a pierogi or golumpki. Ok folks? We clear?"

My sister picked this place. It was our first time here. I have to say, it was an excellent choice. Wednesday night is Mariachi night, and my grandma enjoyed the live music a lot. The atmosphere in this place is excellent. The decor was amazing full of colors but elegant at the same time. Many of your &#34;traditional Mexican restaurants&#34; do not really portrait a vivid image of the culture. That is definitely not the case here. Mexican cuisine is not just tacos and tortas. Mago Grill certainly supports this statement. 

The food was excellent, more than excellent! My wife had the &#34;Carne Asada Tampiqueña&#34; and even she asked for it well-done, the steak was super tender, juicy and full of flavor. I had the Atun en Mole Tamarindo, seared yellowfin tuna with a tamarind and chile ancho mole served with mashed sweet potatoes and bacon roasted brussels sprouts. It is an amazing dish, full of different flavors but in harmony. 

The place is also great for kids, they have great healthy options for the little ones. My kids also had a blast listening to the Mariachi, they enjoyed the ambiance of the place as well. 

Our server was Daniel. Hats off to this kid! He did an excellent job, he took the kids&#39; order first and made sure the food came out in order and in a timely manner. We were a party of 12 and I can say that ALL of us came out of there with a smile. It was a great experience and definitely a repeat!!"

Service is not as it used to be when place first opened. Waiters seemed to be annoyed when you tell them you are not ready to order and they seem as if in a rush. Food has always been delicious but potions have been smaller everytime. Today was the worst ....meat was the smallest ever and i took picture to compare to others. When i let server know ..he agreed it looked way smaller than other days. When the manager came to table... (looked like 18 year old) she said meat came pre packaged and weighed by vendor and some meats were bigger than others. I  said ....&#34;You guys need another vender.&#34; 
I was not charged for &#34;kids meal steak&#34; i got. Highly disappointed and will not be coming back soon nor referring anyone. Its ok for a first timer who does not know what to expect."

Décor: They have done a good job making the look and feel of the place feel very &#34;authentic&#34; and cantina-ish. There is a lot of cool art, a bunch of painted skulls, and the tables/chairs are rustic and fun. It&#39;s a large place, so there are lots of tables (but you&#39;re not packed in tightly), and the music is pop/top 40.
Bathroom: It keeps with the décor and is nicely looked after and therefore clean.

Staff: Our waitress was nice but just average. She took our orders just fine but wasn&#39;t overly personable or talkative.

Food: We didn&#39;t have any drinks, just dinner. Starting with the guacamole (made at the table, very tasty) and the chips and salsa (all three salsas were very tasty, particularly the habanero one!) we quickly moved on to our main courses. There was enchiladas (tasty), tacos (enjoyable), a California burrito (good, but a bit odd... the sauce, or mole perhaps?, smelled VERY strange. It, honestly, smelled like fresh feces. The taste was not affected but the smell was awful!), and the Filete Churrasco (lacking any and all chimichurri and was just a regular cut steak, not flat). The portions were pretty good sized and my parents took home leftovers.

Value: The total meal cost, and the individual items, were about what we expected to pay.

Mago was just a so-so experience and I think we&#39;ll explore other options before returning again."

They had innovative dishes with an emphasis on mole (mol-ay) sauces. I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and loved that they incorporated many vegetables in it and garnished it with radishes and tomatillo sauce. It was not just a simple enchilada with cheese and beans! Vegetarians typically don&#39;t have more options other than cheese and beans! 

In addition to the enchiladas, we were served with chips and salsa but not just the typical red salsa you would expect. There was a green tomatillo salsa, a mole salsa, and a spicier orange salsa. We also asked for a habanero to add more spice to our life! The spice was great! 

As a vegetarian Indian, I NEED SPICY FOOD! So this restaurant did a great job satisfying my spicy food needs!"

Me: Hi, I see you have a sangria special?&#34; 
Bartender: Huh?  I don&#39;t think...&#34;
Me: I interrupt him, &#34;it&#39;s on the sign at the door, it&#39;s the only thing on the sign &#34;Sangria $5!&#34;
Bartender: Um, let me ask my boss...

He returns to inform me that was the special &#34;last week&#34; but they will allow us to order sangria for $6 today.  Um....ok.

Next, we asked for chips and salsa, here&#39;s how that went...and I&#39;m paraphrasing on this one, because by now the conversation in the bar was a bit louder and it was harder to hear everything he said:

Bartender: Um, we don&#39;t give chips and salsa out at the bar...&#34;
Me/my friend in unison: &#34;What??&#34;  Like, we.were.dumbfounded.
Bartender: It&#39;s not me, my manager says people will linger at bar and not order food, just chips...

I asked my friend if I thought I heard him correctly, and I did.

In any event, we had to reassure him we&#39;d order apps and not waste space at the bar.  He gave us the chips.  Jeezus, thanks!  I mean, HELLO!  We&#39;re at a Mexican restaurant, don&#39;t they give you chips and salsa for just walking by??  wtf.  I&#39;ve been at several Mago locations, and even this one in the past, but really??  Not again."
mago-grill-and-cantina-south-barrington,Beck H.,PiAQlso3-yG3h-w3Tw2sMg,"Schaumburg, IL",0,1,0,3,8,hW71uDMrZ4y9XHqSFWMf8A,2.0,2016-04-21,"We were a group, who had reserved, so they knew we were coming--about 14 of us.  We went on a Thursday (slow day) and even with us, the restaurant wasn&#39;t at 20% capacity.  Why did it take almost an hour to get tacos?  

Before someone hands me a piece of cheese to go with this sad little whine, let me talk about some of the good stuff, then back to the not so good stuff.

Loved, loved, loved the salsa trio--good chips.  The waitperson kept the baskets full--that should have been the tip off that the kitchen was slow.  One of our party ordered the Taco Salad-- beautiful, bountiful, tasty.  The Chicken Tortilla soup was excellent (although a slice of lime would have been appreciated).  The soup came out 30 minutes after we had ordered.

The soup eaters were the lucky ones -- now, we&#39;re back to the not so good stuff.  If you ordered some other type of food, too bad, it was going to be at least another 30 minutes.   The kitchen didn&#39;t appear to be understaffed.  Why would it take so long to push out a bunch of $4 tacos?  

And, speaking of $4 tacos--my carne asada selection was skimpy.  Just a couple of corn tortillas with a few chunks of meat.  There are a number of taquerias in the area that could beat the pants off of these for a lot less and taste better.  Of course, those places aren&#39;t as pretty as  Mago, so there is a table tax to be paid.

One last item, and it&#39;s something I&#39;ve never written about.  The &#34;To Go&#34; boxes need some work.  Because I had the soup and then filled up on the chips, by the time I got my tacos I was full.  So, I thought I would bring the tacos home.  The waitperson brought me a box.  I struggled with the closure.  I&#39;m not kidding, I really struggled trying to get it to close.  My table companion got so aggravated watching me try to close it, she grabbed it and tried to close it.  She then experienced the same struggle.  Eventually, she used a table knife to adjust the box.  There were three or four of us who had &#34;To Go&#34; challenges.  My table companion became the &#34;Go To&#34; person for the &#34;To Go&#34; box.  

By the way, our waitperson was very attentive.  Kept our glasses and chip baskets filled.  Maybe it was just a slow day in the kitchen, so the delay was just an aberration.  However,  I would suggest that you clean your plate, because my friend won&#39;t be there to help you with your &#34;To Go&#34; box."

I like the nice clean environment here especially at this location but I&#39;ve been to two others and liked those as well. This is a bigger location than the other two and they do get busy at night! You can make a reservation though and I recommend doing so if you come after 7pm.

The foods awesome. They have my favorite tortilla chips anywhere and the green salsa is so good, we always get extra!

I&#39;ve tried lots of things on the menu and my new favorite is the coconut mole sauce with steak. Omg amazing, I&#39;ve gotten it twice and two different locations and it was good both times!

Margaritas are awesome. So far they&#39;ve been able to do what I want frozen or on the rocks. I personally like frozen better.

This is a good casual hang out spot, I&#39;ve seen people on dates and with families and with friends so it&#39;s a crowd pleaser.

The only complaint I&#39;ve had is with their carry out. I actually work in the same mall as this location and gotten carry out a couple times. I feel like you really get ripped off with the portions and it just doesn&#39;t seem as fresh. 

So dine in so you can do their food justice!"

Me being gluten free, I find it hard to locate different options, but Mago Grill &amp; Cantina did NOT disappoint! 

We were seated immediately and informed that we&#39;d be receiving complimentary chips and salsa (not just one salsa, but THREE different varieties!). They were all just fantastic. 

After mulling over the extensive menu, my girlfriend and I each opted to try some tacos. At $4 a piece, they&#39;re a bit pricier than your neighborhood Mexican restaurant, but these tacos are made of a quality ingredients with more in-depth flavor profiles than what you&#39;d normally encounter. If you order two of the same taco, you do get a $0.50 per taco discount. I ordered three, but after noshing on what felt like an endless pit of chips and salsa, two would have been more than enough. 

I can&#39;t remember the exact menu names of what I had, but one taco was a grilled cod, one was a chicken tinga and the best was a spicy shredded pork. 

This place clearly lists what items are able to be prepared gluten free on the menu and the servers are more willing to talk with the kitchen-staff about any other specific needs you might have. 

The only complaint I have is: that of their 3 locations, none of them are less than a 45 minute trip from home! Can&#39;t wait to go back."

This restaurant offers an upscale version of Mexican food, which may attract more of the middle and upper class populations. Everything is not only flavorful and delicious, but it is also presentable.

I absolutely love the complimentary chips that are offered, which come with three different salsas to dip in: a spicy, orange sauce; a green sauce with a kick of lime; and a brown sauce with some type of pepper that&#39;s not as spicy. The guacamole is also a must. It is made right at your table and served on a molcajete (traditional Mexican bowl made from stone). 

The service isn&#39;t always quick because it&#39;s usually busy and the waitresses sometimes forget to bring you what they promised, like more chips. They are friendly and professional, however. 

The food, like I mentioned before, is aesthetically pleasing when served on a plate. Swirls are drawn on your food with sour cream. The food takes up about a fourth of the plate, which is pretty small for their prices. However, because you&#39;re so full from all those chips, you&#39;ll eventually struggle to take that last bite of your dish. 

Overall, I love this place, but can&#39;t afford to go there more often than every two months."

I wanted to give them a chance to reply before I posted a review.  Guess they didn&#39;t care.  
I was there last Friday night at 5:30 and I was very disappointed.  First, we did not have a reservation, but there were plenty of open tables.  We were stuck at a mini table in the back corner next to a window.  It was cold and the table was very small. We asked to moved and were told no.  There was no place to be moved, but there were a lot of empty tables.  We should have left, but decided to stay.  Dinner was great, but our waiter was not.  As soon as we took our last bite, he took the plates and wanted to take our guacamole and chips too.  We said we were still working on them.  He then came back 3 times in 10 minutes and tried to take it again.  It was obvious we were being rushed out to give up our terrible table. We weren&#39;t even there an hour.  We were planning on having another drink, but decided to take our business elsewhere.  We spent almost 100.00 and were treated like crap. It&#39;s always so crowded.  It&#39;s hard to get to your table and out of the restaurant.  It&#39;s also very loud and just too chaotic to enjoy a nice dinner.  I might try another location, but I am done with this one.

We arrived a little early for our reservation but we were still able to be seated right away. It was several minutes before we were served water and the complimentary chips and salsa. The flight of salsas were very different but very flavorful. We were warned several times about the hot salsa have peanuts or peanut oil in it but since we do not have allergies it was not a worry. 

We ordered an appetizer,  which was similar to a chicken taquito. This was the first of my disappointments for the evening. The appetizer had zero flavor or spice.  It was not long before our dinner came out and I only took a few bites of my carne asada tacos before I stopped eating. This time instead of no flavor it was a very weird flavor, almost like barbecue sauce on my tacos. 

My dislike of the food could have been overlooked if it were not for the flies all over the dining room. Again had we been eating outside I would have just accepted it but we were inside.

The decor is nice and the staff is pretty good but those factors alone are not enough for me to return."

I&#39;ve been here several times even though I live in the city! Although my boyfriend and I will go out of our way to get there, we&#39;re patiently waiting for the Chicago location to open up!

The guac is a must. Its nothing special but we crave the guac because it is classic done perfect. I prefer my guac without spice to balance all my other spicy food. 

We love the chips and salsa. They take the classics and add their unique spin to them while matching the surrounding decor. Very clever!

They have $6 margaritas on mondays and tuesdays. Niiiiiice!

We haven&#39;t had any other appetizers but every entree we&#39;ve ordered has been fantastic. A couple days ago, I ordered the pork with pistachio mole! It was deeeeelish!

The service is always outstanding from everyone that has sat us down.

I&#39;ve also been to the original location in Arlington Heights once. I prefer this place because of the decor. Everyone involved with the design has top-notch taste and executed the atmosphere very well, mixing the highly detailed traditional mexican design with minimalist modern!"

We started with complimentary chips and salsa, that I liked. Then we ordered two guacamoles that are made at the table. Actual the person couldn&#39;t get the cart to our table, but we saw the dips being made a table away, no room. 

Once we ordered we then waited and waited for our food. The server came back and said they were working on it and it would be ready soon. This is about 30 minutes now. 

15 more minutes and no food.  Now Crystal the manager comes and says the cooks are really busy and she doesn&#39;t want to FRUSTRATE them to hurry it up. This quickly frustrates me and I start asking if it&#39;s ok to tell us this or to frustrate us?  

She then explains that they&#39;ll do what they can and leaves. 

5-10 minutes more and the food comes out and some plates are cold, which we ask for fresh ones, which they make or warm. Not sure which. 

Also one plate was burnt, a Mexican pie, which we ordered two of, so I wondered how this could be inconsistent. It was exchanged for another. 

The service was ok, but waitress implied this kitchen and manager are always like this, and that&#39;s really bad. 

At the end they did comp a meal for us, which kept me from posting a one star.   

Overall a bad experience."

Location is great in the arboretum. We ordered the table-side guacamole, risotto, and a variety of the vegetarian tacos. The guacamole is made right in front of you, and you can personalize it as you wish! Though a bit pricey, well worth it for the quantity and quality. The food was quite good, but not the best Mexican food I&#39;ve had in the area. In fact, this is more of a fusion restaurant (ex) Mexican risotto, but well worth the try if you&#39;re in the mood for something new.

We had the empanadas for an appetizer and they were delicious. Both of us were disappointed with our entrees. I had Ropa Vieja which was blandly seasoned but had mustard (?!) and pickled onions on top of it, with sweet plantains covered with crema on the side. The combination of flavors was revolting. I have never had Ropa Vieja like that in my life. My husband had the tamales. Instead of being wrapped in cornmeal, they were wrapped in a pepper.

The food is good, and inside, it&#39;s bright and uniquely decorated with luchador masks and other interesting pieces.  The service was excellent.  A few items could have been better, but it&#39;s definitely a place I&#39;d revisit. 

First, do yourself a favor and order the guacamole prepared tableside.  The texture was perfect: mostly creamy without being mushy and just enough bite.  And it tasted so good that I could have made a meal just out of guacamole and chips! 

I ordered the Carne Chihuahua, which is essentially grilled skirt steak topped with delicious chihuahua cheese.  It also has green peppers, mushrooms, onions, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The surprise hit of this dish though was the poblano mashed potatoes.  It was a bit of an oddball in this culinary mélange, but boy did it work!  

There were, as I mentioned, a few misses.  The tacos were disappointing.  They were bland even though they were packed with seemingly flavorful ingredients.  I&#39;m really not sure what happened there.  The margarita was also too sweet for my liking.  

The service was excellent.  Our server was friendly and attentive, and the rest of the staff was very responsive to requests.  That coupled with the overall delicious food at Mago Grill &amp; Cantina made for a very good experience."

If I&#39;m in the area and starving, maybe I&#39;ll give them a try. 

And...

I&#39;m so tired of being disappointed by these new restaurants. I&#39;m gonna wait for a while. 

Well, my sister planned a girls day with shopping on this tax free weekend and made a reservation at Mago. I wasn&#39;t thrilled, but figured that it was just lunch and I&#39;m not investing too much time or money so it will be fine. It was so much more than that!

The look and feel is festive!  From the moment we walked in, we felt welcome and like there was going to be a lot of interesting things to investigate. They&#39;ve done a great job with the lighting (one of my favorite features)!  

The seven of us sat at a round table in the back. Seven was perfect!  We could all hear each other. That was a plus!  

We ordered drinks from sodas to margaritas to Di Saronno on the rocks. We quickly decided on a table side guacamole. But we had a trio of salsas to work through too. I tried all three and didn&#39;t initially like all of them. I tried them again and my initial impressions changed. I&#39;m not sure which was my favorite, but I would definitely indulge in their salsa again!  The guacamole was light on cilantro and seasoned just right. It was right up my alley. They offered mild, medium or hot. We went mild to be on the safe side, but I&#39;d like to try medium next time. 

Surprise!  Here&#39;s a nice size cup of complimentary chicken tortilla soup!  There was a bite which was good for some and too much for others. I loved it!  The veggies were not overcooked and plentiful. The chicken was beautiful. (I had definitely had enough food by this time!)

The entrees. Everything came out together and nothing was cold. Woo hoo!  Chicken enchiladas with mole, veggie enchiladas, two different kinds of rice, a giant chicken burrito, sizzling chicken fajitas, an el pastor taco (just for kicks!), a burrito in salad form and something else that I can&#39;t remember. The oohs and aaahs came from all around the table. The portions were very fair. Plans for return visits were being made before we even left that table. 

The service was very good. The only time we were looking around for our server was at the very end when we wanted to pay the bill. We had spent a while dividing it up, so I think he was trying not to hover. He showed up a few minutes later. 

The to-go containers were nice. Probably not too green, but they have vent holes on top, so I can heat up my lunch tomorrow right in the same container. 

My only real critique. Two specials were described. I totally wanted the second one. Two 4oz beef tenderloins with two crab cakes and a cheese sauce (that I would have subbed out for a mole) and I think potatoes and maybe even another side, but when I asked the price, I learned it was $30. I couldn&#39;t do that on my first visit when entrees started around $10 on the menu. I wish they had a half lunch portion or something. Charge $17 or $18 for half the amount of food and sell more. I would have paid that without blinking an eye. Even $20-ish would have made a difference. $30 was too much for a lunch entree when the price point was so far away from that on the menu. 

We didn&#39;t have room for dessert, but seeing as dinner at Mago is in my near future, I&#39;ll likely report on that soon!"

If you drag your sister clear to Barrington and neglect to get a reservation for the restaurant she wanted to go to, you might end up at Mago.

Loved the starters and could/should have left it at that. Forget the typical &#34;chips &amp; salsa&#34;.  Chips, yes of course, but a trio of dips in place of standard salsa. --roasted tomato (yum), salsa verde (yum) and a cheesy dip (meh). Followed by a dark, rich tortilla soup. --could have had a whole bowl of that. Both complimentary :) We then moved on to fresh guacamole and butternut squash/plantain/black bean tamales with mole. As American tamales go, these were quite good. The guac was fresh and made at our table. --I find the guacamole cart trend to be growing stale, honestly, but I digress.  The guac was supposedly &#34;spicy&#34;, but there was no heat in it in my opinion. Guac *was* very good though. And a generous portion. But, if you call it &#34;spicy&#34;, I want there to be heat.

Meals continued. Perhaps I was full from the starters, but this is where we went from &#34;Yum&#34; to &#34;Ho-hum&#34;. 

Pechuga en Mole Xico: Adobo marinated chicken breast, mole xico, sweet plantains, mexican rice, refried black beans. The breakdown... chicken with mole was good (moist, decent flavor), but skin left on and bone-in. --Very hard to eat with the butter knife I was given. Rice and beans were completely forgettable. Plantains were a nice slightly sweet contrast.

Service was good.  Never were we left, wondering if we&#39;d ever see a refill again. It was very loud. Impossible to hear the people on the other side of our 5 seated table and very difficult to hear our soft spoken server.

I do not anticipate finding myself in Barrington again, but should that happen, I would give it a go again. There were other menu items that I have a curiosity about. On paper they looked like they could be good. Plus, there&#39;s some potentially good shopping in The Arboretum. A maze of stores and shops in a well kept, nicely landscaped outdoor shopping area. But, you might consider shopping VS *before* you stuff yourself with heavy foods."

The freshly made table side guac is so delicious. They also start you off with chips and 3 types of dips/salsa which are all phenomenal. My favorite dish is by far their chicken enchiladas with salsa verde. AMAZING. I did like it better when it was served with the rice and beans separately but now the enchiladas are served on top of the rice. Still very tasty but I prefer the old way. The waiters and waitresses are always very kind. Sometimes it can be a long wait, understandable considering how good it is, so definitely make reservations. Nice atmosphere."

The camajerones were perfectly seasoned - skirt steak delicious and beautifully presented.  We cannot wait to go back.  This was truly a find!

Our waiter (Enrique) went above and beyond in helping/recommending dishes on the menu. He was welcoming and made sure everything was perfect.  Thanks!"

I&#39;ve been going to the one in AH for years, but this SB location has the best people on board.  First of all, Francisco was our server-  he was genuine and prompt.  Then, Crystal and Karen were so lovely to talk to on the way out.  
Francisco gave us a sampling of the moles available and of course we picked the seasonal one with pork! Basically it was like eating a perfectly autumn dish in true Mexican cuisine. Francisco tried to get me to eat dessert for my birthday, but of course I didn&#39;t have room! Sweet, handsome guy! The bussers were hustling the whole time and so nice too. 
On the way out, I chatted with Karen and Crystal(sp?).  They were also genuine and funny.

The decor was very trendy, and very clean.

Their credit card system was down so everything was handwritten and our server totaled the bill and wrote the amount in the amount due, so I thought it had the tip included,  Well after the manager came outside to inform me that I did not leave a tip and I must say embarrassed me in front of my guest, I had to add the tip and cross out what the server wrote and redo the whole thing which took a long time since the system was up and down.  Though my intention was not to stiff the server, his manager should have pointed the error out to him and covered it--not embarrass a customer who may not have wanted to leave a tip, which was not my case.  Tacky"

So, why did I finally review this place after so many other people have expressed their opinions?
Well, last night we stopped in for a late dinner (anything after 6 PM is late for us to eat out....) and there was a band playing and singing.  So, now you know- for an &#34;as good as it gets&#34; go Wednesday night between 6 and 9 PM and be prepared for an all around good time!

We love the Mago in Boilingbrook and decided to go here for mothers day since its close to my moms house. First off we made a reservation a week ahead of time and still had to wait which seems kind of unfair if you went out of your way to make a reservation way ahead of time kind of defeats the purpose. Our waiter was not great took him almost 30 min to just get us our drinks only two of which were alcoholic, even a kids milk took 30 min to arrive to the table which is just not okay. I was scared to see how long it was going to take our food to make it to our table and surprisingly it didnt take to long.

 The next issue was the food, chips salsa and guac all great! the food itself tasteless and overpriced. I had chicken fajitas and the chicken was like thin pieces of dried up leather I could hardly even chew it! no sauce used at all or seasoning the entire platter was dried chicken, overcooked peppers and onions and it all just tasted dried and burnt. The worst fajitas I have ever had. The rice was a JOKE it looked like it came from a box and was literally just rice no seasoning no onions or anything mixed in with it literally boxed rice. The beans were mushy and not even whole anymore and a tiny dollop of store bought guac on the side all for a hefty price tag of $18 seriously a joke. My husband ordered the mole chicken which is half a chicken cooked with the skin on and slathered in a tasteless mole it was more like just a brown sauce pretending to represent mole. I tasted his and it literally tasted like nothing. The skin was left on it so it was just nasty and soggy. This disgusting dish came in at over $20 I have had better food at Mcdonalds! 

Save your money and go elsewhere! this place should not be allowed to be called a Mexican restaurant! its a disgrace to the Mexican cuisine."

I don&#39;t eat beef for religious reasons but I do eat Chicken and I was there for dinner and ordered a chicken burrito to go and I open it at home to cut in half and its steak.  This is the second time they have done this .  I hope they get it together and not keep messing up chicken and steak cause I just wasted another $10.

For that price one should receive jumbo shrimp.

Sweet waitress who tried to please, nice threesome of sauces with chips and decent atmosphere, tasty poblano pepper mashed potatoes, however, both main food entrees were not flavorful and certainly not memorable.  Chilis serves better tasting fajitas for half the price."

Tried this place last year and thought they were just okay.  But friends have raved so decided to place an order to pick-up.  Huge mistake.  

Called in order:
- receptionist didn&#39;t know the menu
- shocked at significant upcharge for rice and beans
- insulted that they would charge for salsa to add to tacos?!
- failed to add details so had to call me back twice with follow-up question (I&#39;m sorry... x2)

Picked up order:
- due to tough parking showed up 5 mins later, food still not ready (I&#39;m sorry...)
- gave my name, no order there (I&#39;m sorry...)
- reminded them what I ordered and they found it 
- server checked order vs my receipt and said have a nice day
- I checked order and everything was wrong.  They gave me someone else&#39;s order!! (I&#39;m sorry...)
- finally they figured out my order, it was wrong.  Apparently, &#34;no onions&#34; was unclear (I&#39;m sorry...)
- waited 10 minutes for them to correct the second dinner while the first dinner got cold, complained to manager, heard, you guessed it, (I&#39;m sorry...)
- heard 2 other people get apologized to for varying mistakes while picking up and others getting apologized to at the bar and tables by the bar.  Amateur hour....

Got home:
- Asked for mild guacamole but it had enough garlic to ensure my future offspring&#39;s offspring will be vampire proof
- one dinner was cold, expected, but flavor was ok, just ok.
- the other was under seasoned, no, not just missing onions, I&#39;m not an idiot.
- and a very long hair in tortillas.  thrown out. 

I was going to call but I already knew what I&#39;d hear?!  Can you guess???

So $50 later, needed to heat up my own dinner, poorly seasoned food, no tortillas for fajitas and annoyed.  To say I&#39;ll never be back would be right.  This place charges gourmet prices against a fancy menu but you get McDonalds service (actually, that&#39;s insulting to McDonalds) and gas station microwave burrito quality.  

But I suppose it&#39;s a &#34;cool&#34; place and folks will still flock there and rave about it..."

Since we waited until the last minute to decide where to go i did not call in a reservation. The wait was about 45 minutes, which is to be expected on a Friday night. I did notice one thing that kind of irritated me while waiting. A group of younger kids arrived shortly after us. they obviously knew the girl checking everyone in and chatted for a short time. Then this same group that came after us, was seated about 15 minutes before us. Again making buddy chat before being seated. I cannot say for a fact that they were not there before us, but it certainly did not look that way. I remember what it was like being that age, and i probably would have hooked my buddies up, or they would have hooked me up the same way. We just would not have made it so obvious. 

After we received our text we were seated. The decor of the place is nice, has a cool look to it. The noise level was pretty high, but again the place was packed. From here basically everything about our experience went downhill. We were brought warm water to our table in a glass bottle, kind of off putting to be brought warm water. Our waitress was obviously swamped but did come by the table about 5 minutes after we were seated. I ordered an Anti-Hero IPA, the waitress came by later on and said they were out, so i ordered a Modello. I did not see the prices on the drafts but didn&#39;t pay it much mind figuring i have been in much fancier places and normally drafts are around 5 bucks or so. Well to my surprise a draft here is 10 bucks. That is a little on the steep side. We got the table side Guac and it was very vanilla. It was basically all Avocado. They should probably just ask if you want table side Avocado dip. I had the Enchiladas and my wife had the burrito. Again the food was very vanilla. It was not bad, but my wife (who is half Mexican)  and i consider this &#34;Gringo&#34; Mexican food. They did bring chips and dip to the table and the dips were all very good. I guess i am a bit disappointed. I was recommended to this place by a good buddy who swore by it. And where the dinner was not super pricey, i expected more for an 80 dollar bill for two. 

I totally get that we were there on a very busy night, and i am always willing to cut a place some slack, but i am overall unimpressed and will probably not return. There are much better places for Mexican food and at much better prices. If you are looking to do dinner in the area Coopers Hawk or the Lucky Monk (just a bit up the road) are around the same cost wise and have much better food."

I have been here about 4 times now. I really have enjoyed each visit and it seems to just get better every time I come. I&#39;m actually pretty happy I waited to write my review because we have had a few bumps in the Mago road on our way but it seems we are working through them. 

The atmosphere is superb. Tucked away in the heart of the Arboretum of South Barrington, just across from the iPic theater, you will find this adorable restaurant that reminds me a lot of Mexico. Its colorful, it&#39;s clean, it&#39;s just a fun spot! I have taken the girls here several times and I actually kinda owe my guy a trip here too. I keep telling him I&#39;m going here and it&#39;s his turn, for sure!

The service has always been 1st rate. Their staff obviously cares about their individual roles; no one is ever standing around and they are constantly clearing tables to ensure you are comfortable and, let&#39;s face it, want to stay to drink their margaritas after dinner! 

Last night I met a friend here for dinner that I haven&#39;t seen in about 17 years. I had made a reservation online and you can too. It was a very easy and simple process.

I was so happy to sit and chat away with my gal pal and our server, Daniel, clearly caught on that we were not in a rush, so he allowed us to enjoy our self-paced meal on our terms. He was helpful and nonintrusive. He kept the glasses full and the food a&#39;comin! We started with a guacamole appetizer which is made fresh tableside to order. We ordered it medium heat with easy onions and it was perfect. We both thoroughly enjoyed every guacamole covered warm chip we ate. We mixed it up a little and drizzled a little of their salsa trio on the guac occasionally to spice it up! We found their Tamarindo mole was on special last night and I asked to sample a little. Daniel obliged and brought us a little cup to taste. We both ended up ordering enchiladas with the tamarindo mole, mine with chicken and hers with steak. Both meals were excellent choices for us. I love that they accommodated our requests. This is where my issue is; they need to work on their food temps. The food is stellar but almost every time I go, the food is not as hot as I would like it to be. I could have sent it back to the kitchen to be warmed up, sure, but I was just chatting away so I didn&#39;t bother.

I&#39;m planning a trip back there with a group of gal pals very soon. I look forward to seeing if they take my feedback into consideration because whether they like it or not, I&#39;m coming back for the service, ambiance and authentic Mexican cuisine. I&#39;m a determined little Senora! See you soon, amigos!"
mago-grill-and-cantina-south-barrington,Karen N.,MuRetHNfWLM8L34t_OHQMQ,"Algonquin, IL",0,1,0,2,10,RXKI-sbMv6jyWt4r_mTEUg,4.0,2015-04-10,"I went to visit my daughter at work in the Arboretum and her co-worker suggested this place as we were looking for a nice Mexican style restaurant for dinner.  When I first walked in I didn&#39;t really care for the decor.  I know a lot of people like it, but I thought it was a bit obnoxious, and it looked expensive.  But, we decided to stay anyway.  

We get seated and quickly are greeted by a very nice, personable waiter.  I wish now that I had gotten his name as I would definitely ask for him next time.  Honestly wasn&#39;t thrilled where we sat as it was a bunch of small tables in a row (booth type seat on one end,  a chair on the other.  The problem here is that we&#39;re all lined up.  We&#39;re right next to each other and can hear the conversations of  the table to my right and my left as well as feeling as though ours will definitely be overheard too.  If I extended my arms, I could have touched the shoulders of the people next to me. Would like a little more privacy!  

We receive our chips and salsa...and wow, three salsa type dips!  I love that...it wasn&#39;t the &#34;run of the mill&#34; salsa that I have in a jar in my fridge.  These were obviously homemade, each different and very, very good...the chips were too!  So, I&#39;m getting impressed now...I open the menu, expecting to see high prices...but, no, they&#39;re not.  They aren&#39;t anymore than the On the Border restaurant near my home, yet that place couldn&#39;t hold a candle to this place.  My daughter is a vegetarian and orders some fish tacos, I ordered the taco salad.  First, we get soup, which was a pleasant surprise and it was delish.  My salad arrived, looked beautiful, tasted very good.  It was in the traditional edible salad bowl and it was fresh and good.  Not soggy with grease or stale as I have had in other places.

Each of her fish tacos were different and she loved each one.  There is so much food she had to take some home.

During the meal our waiter disappears...we don&#39;t see him for at least 15 minutes.  I didn&#39;t care or really notice because we were eating and talking.  The owner comes by our table and asks how everything is, and apologizes for the temporary &#34;slow service&#34; as they just had seated a bunch of new parties and became very busy.  Like I said, I didn&#39;t notice we hadn&#39;t seen our waiter lately and it was fine.  I told him everything is fine and I understand and no problem.  But he was at our table a good 3-4 minutes, very concerned and personable.

All in all our dinner was very good, I&#39;d give that 5 stars.  I didn&#39;t expect the chips and three salsas and them being so different than the traditional salsa.  I didn&#39;t expect soup either.  For what we got I did expect the prices to be much higher.  The service was good as I didn&#39;t notice a lapse and the waiter even made a rose out of a napkin and handed it to me.  Oh, I did order a strawberry margarita.  I won&#39;t do that again though, $9 and I didn&#39;t taste any alcohol whatsoever.

So, food, 5 stars.  Service, 4.  Decor, well, that&#39;s a personal taste issue, but I thought it was a bit much.  Margarita 1 star.  Don&#39;t bother.  Go to 7-11, buy a small strawberry slurpee, smash a strawberry in your hand and drop it in.  Not worth $9.  

I will go back, yes, it was good, different and reasonably priced."

They start you with warm chips and 3 types of salsa -different from ordinary picante types, such as spicy nut and medium avocado.
I ordered the arrachera (skirt steak) with mole.  Their menu includes 5 different mole flavors. The waitress offered samples to help me make the best decision.  I thought all of them were delicious, unique combinations of flavor.  The  pistachio mole seemed to complement the steak best, but Coconut mole was a close second. 
I enjoyed the generous portion of steak smothered in pistachio mole, with Spanish rice on the side.  My friends had enchiladas and tacos, with no complaints and little left over.
For dessert we shared an order of chocolate filled &#39;doughnuts&#39;.  They  were cinnamon-sugar coated pillows filled with a chocolate frosting.  Just enough of a sweet to cap off a tasty meal. 
Although we arrived late, we never felt rushed.  I also loved the large over head doors that were screened in but opened to the outdoor patio allowing  the fresh night air to give you the sense of dining al-fresco without the mosquitoes."

Highly recommend!!!"

Nothing stood out, not the tacos, not the steak, not the cauliflower nachos. They did have an amazing rhubarb spritzer. I like the layers of levels they have here and think it would be a cool place for a teen or &#39;adults that act like teens&#39; party. They have bowling, arcades, game lounges, and enough room to play hide-n-seek on three levels. An elevator takes you through the different floors or &#39;zones&#39;. I wouldn&#39;t mind having a party here if I wasn&#39;t so worried about the food."

In this case, Punch Bowl Social has won my heart via several different routes. 

Overall this venue is chic, hipster meats southern charm with just the right amount of kitschy. Boasting 3 floors, classic arcade games, bocci, bowling, shuffle board, giant jenga, darts and more... including a very large patio, an indoor fire pit with surround seating, a spacious and comfortable dining room, several fully stocked mixology bars and a craft cocktail/food menu.

The entertainment and dining spaces are perfect for groups, work and family outings, intimate dinners, date night, happy hour, social hour, pre-gaming or as your final stop.

The music is modern and hip without the overwhelming pitch of a local nightlife venue, perfect for all ages. 

The cocktail offerings are true to it&#39;s mixology background with fresh ingredients, new and vintage recipes and unique glassware. Also true to the mixology category are the price points..which may be my only complaint. Not to worry though as they have weekday drink specials including $4 well drinks on Monday&#39;s, $2.50 Old Man Can&#39;s Tuesdays, as well as several others.

The food menu is going to appeal to the more foodie crowd but should still have something for everyone. With Gluten Free and Vegetarian options, all things are fresh, homemade and generously portioned. 

I would highly recommend their Cubano sandwich, Huevos Rancheros, Chicken &amp; Waffles and their burger..... If you like biscuits and gravy their version is satisfying but salty so I would recommend having a side of it with another dish as your main. The one note I will make regarding the menu is that everything we have tried is a slightly different version than we expected but we were pleasantly surprised with the rich, fresh and delightful flavors we experienced. Just go into it knowing it is original, unique and wonderfully different.

Like all places, I am sure that there are a few items you may not like, but overall this place is a great find, neighborhood jem and fun spot."

Came here on a Friday night for some food and drinks and overall had a good time . Drink selection was good offering craft beer tap options and top shelf choices in liquor. The adult milkshake: B.B Alexander was an appetizing  deconstruction on a milkshake infused with brandy pilled with vanilla soft serve and topped with whipped cream. 

Being indecisive individuals we decided to order shared plates.  The cauliflower nachos were hands down the groups top favorite. The generous plate portion was served with roasted cauliflower, corn, tortilla chips, jalapeño,cilantro and oozing  queso cheese . For $10 this appetizer definitely gets two thumbs up on flavor and value. Biggest regretful order was the Farmers board. At $14 dollars this various vegetable board ( carrots, parsnips, rutabagas, eggplants, and  beets) stacked with toasted ciabatta ended up being a wasteful order. The vegetable flavors paired awfully and after accidentally eating two whole baby onions we quickly retired this plate. 


Vast activities under one complex bring refreshing  idea to the bar scene locally and bar prices are decent. Will be back for some more drinks and activities but don&#39;t see myself eating here again."

I think if the location wasn&#39;t so hidden it might of been more crowded. The place was dead. 

Now on to the food and drinks. I ordered the adult milkshake BB. Alexander which had E&amp;oh Gallo brandy infused with banana, fresh ripe banana, salted caramel, vanilla soft serve and whipped cream. This was very good and sweet. 

We grabbed few share plates. One was the cauliflower nachos which had roasted cauliflower, corn tortilla , jalapeño,cilantro, quest fondito, quest cotija and pickled onions. The flavor in this was good. 

We also ordered the Farmer&#39;s Board which is plate of veggies. It had Burrata cheese, oven roasted carrots, parsnips, rutabagas, roasted eggplan, turnips, golden beets, cilantro  pesto, toasted ciabatta. We ordered two plates of this and let me tell you it was disgusting. I&#39;ve been here before and I&#39;ve ordered this plate. It was good when this place first opened. But this time Around it was terrible. I actually spit out the food my first bite I didn&#39;t even touch it afterwards. Very disappointed in the quality of the food."

They have a new menu partnering with Past Top Chef, Hugh Atchitson. First of all the decor is beautiful. We only saw the first floor as we just stopped by for dinner.  But the staff explained to us that there&#39;s 2 additional floors with a bar and activity area with games and fun stuff. We&#39;ll definitely come back to try them out another time. The staff was attentive and great on recommendations and service. I tried the punch made with watermelon shrub and it was delish. I drank it down like juice. Very Unique flavors! 
We started with the Canadian (poutine) which honestly was unfortunately the worst part of our meal. It was tasty but not really smothered in a gravy but more of an oily sauce with def not the correct ratio of fries to cheese curds to all else. It was mostly fries. But the fries were tasty. We split a burger which they were super kind to split in half for us along with provide us each 2 side portions of arugula salad with pickled onions, tomatoes and cucumbers. For dessert we got an almond joy milkshake which was amazeballs and the flourless chocolate cake (soooo yummy!). 
Wonderful dinner. Beautiful space. Fun things to do def warrant a trip."

The front windows of the building actually completely opens (like garage doors) so it&#39;s a very nice experience on summer nights. It is a gastro pub with a slight hipster vibe. It definitely has everything - tables for groups or just two, bar area, games, bowling. There are actually three floors! It&#39;s a huge place so even though it does et busy it&#39;s not too over crowded. They also have outdoor dining in the front.

Their drinks are unique. They have alcoholic punches - I tried the &#34;you must bring us... A shrubbery&#34; which is vodka, house made cardamom syrup, watermelon shrub, lemon juice and a red wine float. Took awhile to get the drinks but definitely worth the wait. They also have &#34;adult milkshakes&#34;, beers, and &#34;new school&#34; and &#34;old school&#34; drinks. Of course you can get standard margaritas and such as well. They have a little bit of everything so anyone in your group would be satisfied. They also have house made sodas like Jalapeno cucumber limeade. 

Their food is amazing! You can get small plates and share - like the cilantro wings or street tacos. They have hamburgers and salads. They use fresh jalapeños so things can get spicy. Food came out quickly and was hot. The chicken wings were very well cooked. 

All and all, I will definitely come back. I think this place is great for a group of friends or a party. They have TVs, popular music playing. It does get kind of loud. Would be perfect for my birthday party next year!!! They do get very busy on the weekends so getting refills on your drinks may take a little while. That&#39;s my only real complaint and why I gave it 4 stars."

You literally had to stalk people that are leaving to find a parking spot. Or i guess you can do valet... 

The dining area is not too small but not too big either. There are 3 floors to this restaurant. Main floor is primarily for food. The basement (play area) has a tiny bar, darts, ping pong, foosball, arcade games and 4 lanes of bowling. I did not get a chance to go up to the 2nd floor because it was reserved for a party. 

Saturday night had a good variety of people ranging from their early 20&#39;s to late 40&#39;s. I give the restaurant props for playing good songs (90&#39;s to 2000&#39;s). Brought back tons of memories! The staff/ waiter was all pretty nice and friendly.(at least the ones i&#39;ve encountered). 

Bowling didnt seem too crowded on a Saturday night. You can make a reservation at the main floor. When there is a lane available, they will text you. It is $7 per hour per person plus $3.50 for shoe rental.

So... about that food... it was Meh! We got truffle kettle chips.. NOT impressed at all. Please don&#39;t order it and save your $6-7 bucks. Def. NOT worth the price! 

Street tacos... very tiny. super tiny. like the size of the palm of your hands. Very fusion like. I would probably avoid it too... 

The Cubano was decent. A little oily but the meat was tender and the pickle went well with it. The fries that came with it wasn&#39;t good... Usually, fries are pretty good but these were just not those kind of fries... And their organic ketchup... was very sweet and weird. Consists of mostly sugar.  Did not go well with the fries at all. 

Overall, i wouldn&#39;t really come here for food. But yes to entertainment!"

The bottom level is decked out with a bowling alley, two karaoke rooms, ping pong table, bocchi ball, and darts. I am not quite sure about the pricing for all of these activities since we all pitched in for the bill.

When I was there, there was about 2-3 waiters/servers working the entire floor so service was a bit slow. It took a good 5-10 minutes to order the my drinks. 

The karaoke room we were at was small, snug fit for about 5-6 people. The song selections were good but the volume control level was broken and we couldn&#39;t turn up the music at all..so we barely hear the music to sing along to.

Overall, this is a good place to throw a kickback and hang out with a large group of friends. They have the main floor for dine-in and I think more activities on the upper level."

If you are coming here, I highly recommend making reservations. On a weekend night, it fills up fast. The parking lot fills up too (that part sucks). The decor is awesome, modern retro. There are 3 levels - upstairs and downstairs each have a bar and games. The main level has the restaurant and bar.

The drink menu is nice. They have a bunch of cocktails that come in vintage glasses. They also have the punch bowls. I think they are cute, they literally come in a bunch bowl with a ladle and a few glasses. I personally think the punch bowls are expensive and have way too much ice in them, but they do taste good. They also have adult milkshakes. I had a regular milkshake and it was awesome!

The food is great. Their menu does change. They have street food/comfort food. I had they tacos and they were really good. My friend had the sweet tea chicken and that was stupid good too. They have hand cut fries that are perfect. There wasn&#39;t anything that I didn&#39;t like. On top of it, our server was very nice and attentive.

If the food and drink aren&#39;t enough, try out their games. They have bowling, boccie, ping pong, darts, arcade games, foosball, huge jenga and scrabble games, and board games. Keep in mind you have to pay extra for everything except he board games. I think that part is stupid...I could see charging for bowling and boccie, but not ping pong, darts, etc. But whatever.

I could see how you could drop some dough here between the food, drinks, and entertainment. I really like it, but it is a little pricey."

Wow!  The hubs, nugget, and I were blown away.  

They have a make your own Blood Mary Bar/Buffett that I could have made my whole meal.  Carrots, cucumbers, celery, gerkins, pickles, cheese cubes, shrimp, bacon, beef jerkey, salami (and other cured Italian meats), pickle juice, salt, hot sauces, and about 80 other options.  Holy Cats!

Upon ordering, they bring your fresh biscuits and strawberry preserves. I didn&#39;t partake but the hubs and nugget loved them.  Since it was a special occasion we ordered an appetizer before our meal.  Deviled eggs...fantastic!  I got the breakfast tacos....so good.  The hubs got corned beef hash.  He said when he imagines corned beef hash, this is now what he will imagine forever.  The nugget had a scrambled egg, bacon, potatoes, and toast.

The nugget and I used the photo booth.  For $3 bucks you get four pics...just like in the old days.  So much fun.

We can&#39;t wait to come back for cocktails and games some night!"

Will we be back though? No. Here&#39;s why...
The layout is a little confusing. We were greeted right away, but it took a few minutes to figure out who was actually going to seat us and where, for some reason. Speaking of confusing...the menu is a little unusual and complicated. It&#39;s like normal food dishes, trying to be something they aren&#39;t and competing with each other for your attention. (Even now, I&#39;m still confused by it). My $8.00 cocktail was small and tasted mainly like juice, absent the rum it supposedly had. And the final kicker? The giant pile of beans on our plates that overshadowed the street tacos. Since when is a side the focus of the plate? And who eats that much refried beans in one sitting? Sorry, but Punch Bowl was an &#34;empty bowl&#34; experience for us. Sad because it seems like a location with such great potential."

I was shocked to find out that this restaurant has three floors. They have bowling, karaoke, ping pong, darts, arcade games, etc. For the prices: $25 for one hour of karaoke (up to 5 people per room), $10 for ping pong and $7 per person for bowling. The lower floor has two karaoke rooms, 1 ping pong table, and 4 lanes for bowling. In addition, they also have more ping pong tables and karaoke rooms on the second floor. The staffs are friendly and helpful. We had a big group of people, but they still managed to take our food and drink orders in a timely fashion manner. 

One of my friends and I ended up ordering three different dishes: Chicken &amp; Waffles, tacos, and a Mexican Burger. The waffles were delicious, however, the chicken itself was not up to par. It was really dry and we did not finish it. I would not recommend getting the tacos since the tacos (3 of them) were small and it was $11 bucks. On the other hand, the burger was amazing. The fries were crispy and the meat was cooked to perfection. I really wanted to try the blueberry lemonade, but did not get a chance to. Maybe on my next visit."

As I mentioned service was stellar and the classic cocktails were great. The entire team was happy and most importantly the event didn&#39;t look thrown together or like it was planned last minute.

Crimini mushrooms... okay but the greens they were on? Pulled from the ocean or something, sooo salty, not sure why... I mean it looked like garnish. 

Friend had grilled cheese... there was some kind of pear jam or glaze with the cheese that made it sweet. Weird dinner.

The Ahi Tuna and Soba noodles... sounded amazing... SO salty... we&#39;re the broccoli soaked in some oyster sauce to hide being old and overcooked? The noodles looked old too... tuna was technically overdone rather than seared... but was still good since I like it well done.

Waitress (hey Shelly) saved them a star... plus the lounge and arcade and bowling areas... and Karaoke?!!!  do make it kinda cool... great things can happen there, if promotion  happens...

A pink vintage fridge in the corner. A giant scrabble board. Adult milkshakes in mason jars. The sound of bowling balls knocking pins over.

Uhm. Awesome, right?

And that&#39;s just a handful of things I noticed as I walked into Punch Bowl Social.

When I changed my suggestion for a gathering over the holidays from some other bar in Schaumburg to Punch Bowl Social, I had no idea what I was in for. I had assumed it was some other trendy bar in the suburbs. And, well, it kind of is.... but with a vintage, casual twist.

It&#39;s a bar. A restaurant. A bowling alley. A place to sing karaoke. A place to sit around the table and play board games. Or play on a pinball machine. Or darts. Or sit around the fireplace. All with some kind of trendy, vintage flair: retro booths, mason jars, deer silhouettes, etc.

You could come here and make a night out of it: get dinner, desert, drinks, and play games!

The main floor has dining areas and bars. Here, you can order a freshly pressed juice or an adult milkshake to accompany your deicious, somewhat healthy appetizer or meal. Or maybe try one of their &#39;punch&#39; specials. I ordered both the &#34;You must bring us..... A Shrubbery&#34; and the Lord Stanley&#39;s Cup. They were yummy, although the &#34;.... Shrubbery&#34; was my favorite, though. I also sampled some of my husband&#39;s chips and salsa --- sooo good! Everyone else at the table loved their drinks and appetizers. I wanted to try them all. It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve been to a restaurant that offered fresh dishes. Fantastic!

The basement level has four bowling lanes, darts, bocce ball, bags/cornhole (whatever you call it), some pinball games, a little bar, and some seating. It kind of feels like a basement, actually. The top floor (which has a grand staircase, leftover from when John Barleycorn was in this location), is a bit more upscale, with another four lanes of bowling, a small bar, seating, eight-person foosball, and a little area to gather around a fireplace (that was not lit the night we were there). 

The clientale was fascinating -- a mix of all ages and types of people. I felt comfortable here, and would feel comfortable even if I had dressed down or dressed up. There&#39;s a spot for everyone. If I still lived in the area, I&#39;d probably come here frequently -- even if it was just for a drink and a board game. The bowling looked awesome, but there&#39;s a wait (and a per/hour charge in addition to shoe rental), and the other games.... well, I personally don&#39;t think they&#39;re worth paying for. The karaoke was interesting -- you can have your own room to sing in with some friends, but the rooms are small, and again, a bit of a price to pay. At least the board games are free! Oh, and for sports fanatics -- there are enough large-screen televisions with sporting events for your entertainment.

So.... my star rating? I want to give this place a 4.5. Although I was a bit blown away by Punch Bowl Social, I wasn&#39;t too thrilled with the wait for bowling (we tried to get a game, but the wait was forever regardless of the empty lanes) and some of the prices (including tip, we paid $40 for three drinks and an app). The classic arcade games weren&#39;t cheap either. Four stars it is.

Really cool concept to have in Schaumburg, though. Hope it&#39;s there to stay."

I first discovered it when at Woodfield Mall and searching for &#34;happy hours&#34; After checking out the Yelp listing, the cauliflower nachos intrigued me so we decided to stop in. 

I&#39;m no stranger to Pinstripes and this reminded me of a bigger version. There&#39;s pinball on the main floor near the bar and also other activities on other floors. 

Since we visited here on our way to another event, I kept it light (although my husband decided to order real food) I tried the jalapeño cucumber limeade for my drink. It was ok but I probably wouldn&#39;t get it again. My husband got the almond joy milkshake and he loved it but couldn&#39;t finish it. 

For the app, we did try the cauliflower nachos with pork. It was so good! We were confused though because we thought it would be nacho ingredients (no chips) on top of pieces of cauliflower. It&#39;s actually just normal nachos with a few pieces of cauliflower at the bottom. Still delicious but not what we were expecting. 

My husband got the New Mexican burger (also on the HH menu) it was seriously fantastic. I kept stealing bites and wanted to eat the whole thing. Their fries are also pretty good. 

The staff were really friendly and explained how everything worked. The only complaint I have is the HH menu isn&#39;t all that great price wise. You only save a buck on pretty much everything, as compared to other HH where you&#39;ll save more. I&#39;d still recommend coming here though because their food is great and there&#39;s a lot to do to entertain yourself. 

I&#39;ll probably be coming back within the next few weeks just to check out what else PBS has to offer."

We stopped by this establishment last night for a few drinks and some ping pong. While playing ping pong we were greeted by a very nice taller bartender in the cellar. While serving us one of our friends asked the bartender to make a cool strong drink. I reminded my friends that they were known for their punch bowls even though we didn&#39;t see any drink menus. The bartender makes us this punch bowl which was pretty good (tasted a lot like a fruity juicy drink). 

We ordered 2 more not really thinking about it. Long story short. We get our tab at the end of the night and those 3 bowls alone made around $210 of the bill. YEA $210!!!

At this time there was a bartender shift change and he was replaced with a shorter shaggy haired bartender. We brought our concern to this bartender letting him know if someone told us the bowls were about $70 a piece there is no way we would have bought 2 more. INSANE!

The new bartender wanted nothing to do with helping us so we asked for a manager. This heavier set guy with a tattoo sleeve came down and was no help AT ALL. I told him I don&#39;t mind paying for the first bowl but can you tell us the bowl was around $70?  Trust me if we knew we wouldn&#39;t have bought 2 more. Also there were 4 of us drinking out of them. You would think around $210 in booze would have us at least buzzing but nope nothing.  The manager says I can&#39;t do nothing for because the booze was drank. I ran a bar for 10 years and trust me that is not what you are taught when it comes to customer service. 

The concept is cool, the drinks are ok, the food is good but the customer servers is TERRIBLE. If there was a 0 star I would have given them a 0!  If the owner or GM wants to contact me to go over details please feel free to reach me."

When it first opened, my group of colleagues decided to check the place out for lunch.  We were hesitant at first because the previous 2 companies were not that great.

As we stepped in, we were happily greeted by the hostess who seated us right away.  They also mentioned that they were to give us a tour after lunch if we wanted which I believe is extremely advantageous of them to promote their place.

We started our lunch with the cauliflower nachos which were surprisingly delicious.  This started off a great lunch.  Several of us ordered their sandwiches and even one of my colleagues ordered the chicken and waffles all to our liking!

As we finished lunch, we were given the tour.  This place is occupied by 3 floors of bars, entertainment and fun.  On the base floor, they have a 4 lane bowling alley, table tennis, classic arcade, bocci ball lane, dart boards and 2 private rooms for karaoke and a full service bar.  On the 2nd floor, they also have a 4 lane bowling alley accompanied by several foosball tables (an 8 person table), shuffle board and a full service bar.

Would definitely recommend this place for a meal as well as pure social fun!  It is also a great place for company or personal outings!"

I think this location is cursed, sorta.  John Barleycorn was not good, and consequently, disappeared.  Punch Bowl Social, I think, is soemwhat better than John Barleycorn.  I really hope that they will succeed and flourish.  But we&#39;ll see.

It is really good thing that they offer brunch menus on Saturdays and Sundays.  All their  brunch entrees are yummy.  Their dinner entrees are hit-or-miss: their Trout dish and Cubed Steak are so-so; their St. Louis Ribs are good.  The problem is their wine selection: it is seriously lacking.  My husband, a beer drinker, says that their beer selection is mediocre.

But I think this still is one of the better bar/restaurant in the Schaumburg area.  If you&#39;d like to have a good brunch or a causal dinner with some drinks, this is the place to be."

Carolina made my mom one of the best Cosmos she&#39;s ever had, perfect color and flavor. We were so thankful it wasn&#39;t made from a mix. I also loved the jalapeño infused something with the lemon vodka, soooo tasty, of come back here just for that.  We also had their cauliflower nachos, the portion was really big! And very tasty!"

I ordered the pork belly Mac and cheese. It was rich, savory and everything I could hope for and more!  I had some sort of berry drink to go with my dinner which was incredible as well. 

After dinner we walked around and started to explore the place.  They had only recently opened so not everything was up and running. Only upstairs bowling was working and there was a wait. The guy told us there wasn&#39;t then we proceeded to wait 30+ minute to get a text before giving up on the idea. No one rally seemed to know who was on first here. The bocce ball was also unavailable that night. I like the idea of having board games to borrow, but they really need a better selection. The idea of pinball machines is awesome, but I don&#39;t plan on paying through an app. Sorry guys. 

I&#39;ll give this place another go in the future to give them time to work out the kinks, but for now it seems a bit overpriced and disorganized. I really wanted to like this place and I hope they straighten up!"

It was my first time coming to Punch Bowl Social.  I had heard nothing but good things.  It was a Friday night and I expected the place to be extremely crowded.  It wasnt and were able to be seated right away to eat.  

I was happy because my love and I love sports and we were seated in great sight for a large tv.  Unfortunately after sitting for a substantial amount of time and never provided any hellos or how are yous or water or anything for that matter we decided to leave.  

As we got up to leave someone came right over and said how may I help you.. it was too late.. we left.  

Sigh.. on to the next spot."

The had the biscuts and gravy. Huge portion, but really good. 
They make everything in-house. Including the jelly! I&#39;m not a fan of bloody Mary&#39;s but they had a great bloody Mary bar. Made me wish I liked them! 
I had the punch of the day."

I read the reviews and thought it seemed like an interesting and fun place to try out in the suburbs. 

Upon arriving, the bouncer at the door IDed us - and that was it. We wanted to get a bite to eat, but instead we circled the empty first floor in confusion - did we seat ourselves? We asked an employee for assistance and he walked off to the bouncer, came back to the table he was cleaning, and didn&#39;t acknowledge us - at all. It was incredibly awkward.

So we opted to sit at the bar. The bartender handed us late night menus which consisted of nachos and burgers. We were surprised that they converted to such a minimal menu at 9:15pm. We glanced around the empty bar and opted to eat elsewhere. I asked if there were any drink specials and was told, &#34;Not really.&#34; I ordered two drinks and they came out to be $20 - super expensive for a dead bar. Oh well, I decided that drinks would be marked up here due to the entertainment - bowling, bags, Kareoke, arcade games, advertised board games - that must be what made this place so worth it! 

I immediately closed my tab and the bartender lingered, watching me as I put in my tip. I held onto the receipt for a few minutes and he still just stood there, watching me, waiting. He didn&#39;t say a word. It added to the incredibly uncomfortable atmosphere that we were introduced to walking in the front door.

There were two more floors to explore so we went upstairs. There was another bar where a few people were chatting, a couple of private rooms and a very upscale sitting area with leather couches and chairs around the fireplace. Interesting, but not what we expected. We made our way to the basement to explore further.

The basement is where the entertainment was at - bowling, bags, darts, billiards. Definitely a better environment with more people. All of the entertainment was outrageously expensive, though - $25 an hour for &#34;private&#34; Kareoke, and all of the other options were also racked up price-wise for hourly entertainment. We sure didn&#39;t want to commit to an hour at this place, so we left after exploring and figured that this place might be more suitable on a Thursday or Friday with a bigger group. 

We&#39;ll give this place another try in the future, perhaps when we have a bigger group. But our first impression left us feeling rather skeptical - expensive drinks, overpriced entertainment, and awkward, stand-offish staff."

Mac &amp; Cheese! Chicken &amp; Waffles! The only two things you need. But really, between those two entrees, an appetizer of truffle kettle chips, and happy hour, does one really need anything else? (Happy hour is between 3-6 Monday through Friday.) 

I highly recommend this place for their food and drinks. Their menu is big enough (we went during restaurant week and overwhelmingly had 4 different menus placed in front of us), so you should definitely find something on there! 

The down side... The restaurant is a &#34;social club&#34; gastropub right by Woodfield, so yeah, it&#39;s a bit pricier than your standard bar/pub. Even during happy hour, our bill was $60 (that&#39;s with two of us and a total of 3 drinks on the bill which were &#34;deals&#34;). 

I will be back soon."

Always slightly hesitant I may have just brought my coworkers to try something that turns out horrible...But I rely on the small hope we may have an awesome meal. Well, good news everyone - Punch Bowl Social serves up some delicious food and the decor is pretty darn cool.

Service still has some kinks to be worked out (didn&#39;t know where to seat us, issues splitting bills which I know is super annoying but in Schaumburg the town of biz after biz who will be coming in for lunches with coworkers it&#39;s a necessity, and a bit slow) but I am certain these will be worked out. There less than a week in! I&#39;m giving them a break. Even with these wrinkles, every staff member was very friendly and eager to talk to us. 

They started our table out with some biscuits which were insanely good! We all loved smothering the jam on those bad boys and devoured them right up. We started with a couple of apps for the table and both were really good. 
Deviled Eggs ($6) - chicken eggs, bacon jam, tartar sauce, mustard, baby arugula...That bacon jam is money. I wish it was smothered across the whole top of the egg because I ended up with the lump in one bite and not in the other. Wah wah! That jam makes the whole egg soooo...just needs to be a bit more spread out because it was really friggin good!
Stuffed Criminis - ($9) - crimini mushrooms, taleggio, oven roasted tomatoes,
celery, onion, mixed greens, olive oil, sea salt - Overall good dish, my coworkers loved it. I am not into half the ingredients so it wasn&#39;t my favorite but they were tasty enough. Huge platter portion!
Blueberry Lemonade - ($4) - house made blueberry syrup, fresh lemon juice - Really tasty and very sour so if you aren&#39;t into lemons, this isn&#39;t for you! It&#39;s not subtle in flavor at all but I enjoyed it quite a bit. For some reason the pricetag is slightly painful to me on this though...maybe bring it down just 50 cents to make it more palatable. 
Very Serious Grilled Cheese - ($12) - grilled ciabatta, poached pear, gruyère cheese,
goat cheese, quince - Definitely not your standard grilled cheese. I loved this! Pears always go so well with lighter cheeses and so this grilled cheese is a uniquely tasty hit. If you don&#39;t like goat cheese, of course don&#39;t get this. Goat cheese has a strong bite to it and is not for everyone, but I love it so the sandwich faired well for me. This sandwich comes with sea salt kettle chips which were nomz, as well and thankfully not overly salty.

Every portion we had was just huge! Even the appetizer portions were big and we didn&#39;t end up finishing the mushrooms.

Also, you can control the music while you&#39;re there! I played an alt-j and Jimmy Eat World song while I was there. Download the app and you&#39;re good to go. You&#39;ll get the first couple of plays free, then you&#39;re hooked and gotta fork up the cash. 

Our entire stay was downstairs in the dining area but upstairs they are packed full of fun things - bowling alleys, karaoke, pool, darts, pinball, skeeball, arcade games, bags, shuffleboard and they were rolling in a ping pong table at lunch today. I got a catering menu while I was there as I think it&#39;s a viable option for upcoming parties for my company. And as the planner of all things party at my office, I&#39;m on it! 

I&#39;m excited to see what comes of Punch Bowl in the future but am thinking we finally have a keeper in the old Barleycorn spot. But please...add some lunch specials!!! I spent $30 at lunch today for an app for my table, my sandwich and a drink. I&#39;d love for this to be a weekly spot for my coworkers and I but $30 a week is too steep! So pleaaaaaase add some $8 smaller lunch portions. That will get the job done!"

We were going to go eat brunch there today but there were absolutely no parking spaces! Thankfully there was Yelp to the rescue and I was able to see that Punch Bowl Social was close by and offered brunch. How lucky!

We drove to Punch Bowl and were astonished at how much renovating they did to the restaurant. It looks amazing! And there&#39;s an ample amount of parking which is a huge plus.

The food itself was quite the showstopper - it was all extremely delicious. We had - 

The Jessica Rabbit fresh squeezed juice - so refreshing, I loved the amount of ginger they put in it. Perfect! 

Biscuits and strawberry jam - this was complimentary and so delicious! Who doesn&#39;t love warm biscuits and jam?

Deviled eggs - this starter did not disappoint. It was bursting with flavor!

Huevos Rancheros - my dish had a great range of spices and filled me up completely. I couldn&#39;t even finish half of it, it was so filling!

Omelette special - my husband had the special which was an omelette with mushrooms, onions, ham, bacon, and cheddar cheese. It was humongous and came with breakfast potatoes which were nice and crispy. He loved it. 

Overall we really enjoyed Punch Bowl Social. The interior is beautifully done, they have bowling lanes in the basement and upstairs, arcade games (Game of Thrones and Walking Dead pinball!) and lounges done in a super classy way. 

It was super reasonably priced for brunch. They also have the option of a DIY Bloody Mary bar with over 20 toppings for brunch. The service was great, quick, and super friendly. 

This place is a great brand new addition to Schaumburg, I highly recommend it! Try it out, it&#39;s definitely a gem and we&#39;ll be back for sure :)"

I went here last night with some friends and it was pretty empty all night.  I&#39;m not sure if people don&#39;t know about Punch Bowl opening yet or because of the poor location.  Either way Punch Bowl is a neat bar/venue and nice addition to the burbs.  It has three floors and we were mainly in the basement.  

PBS has arcade games, bags, bowling, darts, ping pong, billiards, and private karaoke rooms.  The only downside is that arcade games aren&#39;t free...say what?? Apparently you have to download and app and then enter your credit card info and then you can play the games there.  That&#39;s bogus in my opinion since there are a bunch of beercades in the city where they don&#39;t charge you for the games.  Besides that I know bags, darts, and ping pong are free but I&#39;m guessing the rest you have to pay for.  

I like that PBS has lots of space and plenty of TVs for airing games.  We had some drinks and food while we played some of the games.  Their food was decent but not amazing; I split the chicken and waffles with my sister and it was pretty filling.  It wasn&#39;t served with syrup but rather had some sort of sweet gravy with sweet pecans on top.  Some friends ordered the tacos and they said those were pretty good so I&#39;d try that the next time I come.  As for the drinks, I was in the mood for some cocktails and tried the &#34;You must bring us..a Shrubbery&#34; and Lord Stanley&#39;s Cup, both of which were good but I definitely preferred the first.  

I&#39;d be curious to see how their Sunday brunch is and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back soon to check it out again with friends or coworkers."

It&#39;s great for me being in the suburbs.  Not often do we get to party out in the burbs.

I got here with a group of friends around 6pm and the upstairs was already packed.  The first floor was about half full with people sitting down to eat.  Our group wanted to play games so we went downstairs to check it out and ended up staying down there for the next 5-6 hours. 

I guess everyone was upstairs so we were able to snag a long table downstairs.  A server came to take our food and drink orders but then the rest of the night he would disappear for extended periods of time.  

We ended up taking over the bags area (and then ping pong....and then darts).  It was fun playing games and drinking without it being overly crowded.  

It was a fun time overall.  I drank &#34;you must bring us...a shubbery&#34; all night.  It&#39;s a very fruity, light on the alcohol, drink but tasty.  

The only issue was our server who kept disappearing.  He also kept confusing my sister, one of our Asian friends and I.  He would hand us the wrong drinks and ended up putting the wrong items on the wrong bills because apparently all Asians look alike to him.  Thanks jerk.  My sister and I may be family but we look nothing alike so stop stereotyping."

It&#39;s pretty confusing when u walk in there&#39;s a bar and dine in area with a couple pinball arcades then a cage with the bowling shoes. So you have to go up to the cage with the bowling shoes if u decide to bowl karaoke dart bags etc. There is stairs and a elevator to get to the other floors. The basement has the most activities bowling darts bags and arcades. The first floor looks like for dinning the second floor is more chill and spread out. I would definitely come back in a bigger group. I would of gave it 5 stars but the arcade selection downstairs was real small and u have to download a app to pay the game to play. Mortal kombat joystick didn&#39;t work oh well there goes a $1. Drinks and service was really good I didn&#39;t try the food but I definitely will go back.

Now, what does 5-stars mean?  It means that they did a good job, fun and and has bowling alleys, so I like it. Is it the greatest place ever?  Probably not, b/c nothing is. One note, expect &#34;city&#34; prices."

Brunch was good. I enjoyed the standard breakfast (eggs, toast, bacon, &amp; breakfast potatoes). My parents had the Monkey bread French toast (w/eggs and bacon). The French toast was more like a bread pudding than French toast, which was unexpected. It was good, but extremely rich. Additionally, I had the Strawberry Rhubarb Fizz, which was good, but extremely sweet. I would almost prefer to get it with a plain soda and dilute it a tad. The only downside was the only jam they had was strawberry jalapeño, so I was bummed as I would have liked another option for my toast. They also have a Bloody Mary bar for those who love them. Overall, The service was great! 


I&#39;d highly recommend going here for drinks/dinner. I came for a birthday party with friends and we had a blast. There are so many options, you can bowl, play ping pong, big jenga, scrabble on the wall and more! Great drink options, I had a bourbon smash, I thoroughly enjoyed it was a good mix of liquor and sweet. I had the truffle chips, which were awesome; crispy and delicious. My friends got a variety of burgers which also looked good.  My only complaint was the hostess was a bit rude when we asked for a table. The wait staff was great and super accommodating. 

Four stars, as breakfast was over $40 for three people with no liquor ordered. Also lack of jam and not a ton of brunch options. Also due to rude hostess when I was there a previous time."

The only reason I take one star is because the service was terrible. As soon as the server found out we were only getting dinner and 1 or 2 drinks he completely deserted us. It took us 20 minutes to get check. And then another 20 minutes to recieve final receipt. I would usually take 2 stars for bad service but the food out weighed the terrible server.

It reminds me of Pinewood Social in Nashville but not as hip. The restaurant is a diner theme which I wish it wasn&#39;t. I&#39;m not a fan of that. The food I did have was solid but nothing to write home about. While I was there I didn&#39;t play any games but I did walk around and check the whole place out. There have pinball machines on the main floor which I wanted to play but they require you to download an app on your phone and put your credit card information on it. I didn&#39;t want to go through the hassle of that and none of the other people I was with wanted to either so we passed. We then walked upstairs which is adorable. I love the theme they have going on up there. After that I checked out the basement floor. The basement looks like a basement. Compared to the rest of the place, it doesn&#39;t look finished. It&#39;s also a lot colder in the basement than the rest of the building. 

I think I&#39;ll give this place one more visit to try the bowling out but only as long as I don&#39;t have to be in the basement."

The food itself is quite pricey but it is also very good.  When I come back again I will probably split one of the more expensive dishes with somebody else.  I furthermore recommend giving one of the fancy sodas on the menu a try.  

The service was very attentive, from the door greeter, to the waiter, to the person who saw we MIGHT be interested in the board games.

It&#39;s like a fusion between Dave N Busters and Painted Pin back in Atlanta.

First, we sat down to have lunch. I had the JESSICA RABBIT (carrot, apple, ginger juice) - I love love ginger but this drink had soooo much ginger in it that even I couldn&#39;t drink it, so I had to ask the waiter to switch it for me. He gladly brought me a new one, which was much much milder (maybe a little too mild, haha) but he was so nice about it that I didn&#39;t mind. 

We had the CAULIFLOWER NACHOS - super super heavy and cheesy, but the cauliflower bits were yummy with the jalapeño. I then had the CHICKEN AND KALE SALAD - delicious! Also topped heavily with cheese and the croutons were super salty - I wish the seasoning would be softer because I had to drink a lot of water.

Husband had a burger and fries - some reviews said the fries were not crisp but I loved them. If you have ever had beef fat fried fries, they are just like that. A nice slight outer crisp with soft insides, well seasoned and super yummy! 

We then went downstairs and had a blast bowling for an hour - super affordable! Just $5 and hr and $3.50 for shoes. The interior of this place is so hip and trendy with beautiful industrial style details. The husband and I bonded and spent some much needed quality time together. For some food and fun, check them out!

We will be back to try some more!"

We spoke with the manager once the playing card machine was not working downstairs, and I told him what we were celebrating. He probably saw the boredom and desperation on my face so he said, no worries! We could play ski ball on the house! And bowling!

The Punch Bowl has everything you could possibly want to do with friends on a weekend night.  Games, drinks, food, fun. We were never bored the entire time we were there. Our server (Mimi) was awesome and recommended her favorite appetizer (The Pimento Cheese spread yummm) and her favorite drink (Jalepeno limeade). She even suggested I add tequila to it to give it more of a kick and it certainly worked!

All in all, The Punch Bowl is a great place to hang out and bring friends. I will definitely be back with co workers!"

Overall it seems like a fun place. However, even though their whole *thing* is being social with a group of friends, they really aren&#39;t set up to accommodate large groups of friends. 

First, there is really not enough parking for this place! 

Second, our group was placed at the front standing bar area (and I noticed there was another birthday group on the other side of the room placed similarly at the front standing bar area), so there wasn&#39;t really enough space to do anything other than eat and drink. They have games that you can check out and play at your table, but that was impossible for us. Considering almost every other table there is big and square (for the purpose of playing games with friends?), it was really disappointing that we couldn&#39;t. And we tried--it just didn&#39;t work.

Third, the noise level. I understand that to some degree you want loud music for a fun, boisterous atmosphere. This was not that. This was club music loud. You had to practically shout at the person next to/across from you to have a conversation. This made group chat pretty much impossible.

Fourth, their game reservation policies. No reservations is a terrible idea. We went for bowling or maybe some karaoke. We ended up doing nothing but eating and drinking and *trying* to play a card game. With how busy it was, everything else was packed and the wait for activities was really long. (We weren&#39;t really interested starting bowling three hours after we arrived.) Also, be prepared to spend lots of money if you want to eat, drink and do things. Definitely on the splurge list.

So really, this place is not set up for large groups. In fact, I&#39;d say go somewhere else if you have a group larger than 6 people. BUT the atmosphere is fun and there are a lot of things to do... so I would like to actually come back with a smaller group of people."

Upon entering to meet my group, it was very easy to find them, and the hostess was great.

Once I sat down, our group of 6 was constantly being asked if we wanted to order.   We ordered drinks, and were immediately asked if we wanted appetizers.  We said, maybe in a bit.    Our drinks came out in a fair amount of time, and we were asked again about appetizers.  One of my party said, &#34;in a bit, we are going to relax for awhile&#34;.   Not more than 3 minutes later, the waitress came back and asked again.   At this point, we ordered, but it was a very rushed process.   She wanted to take our dinner order at the same time, and we said we weren&#39;t ready.    When we got the appetizers (quesadillas, deviled eggs, and chips and salsa), there really wasn&#39;t enough for 6 people to share.  Very small portions.    

We ordered dinner, 4 burgers, 1 grilled cheese, and the street tacos.   3 of the burgers were the American Burger.    

When our order came out the server, a runner, and a manager couldn&#39;t figure out which burger was which, and physically had to lift the buns of the burgers to ascertain doneness.   Low and behold, one was wrong and had to be remade.   This took no less than 10 minutes.   I would think they could have put together a burger much quicker than this.

The medium rare burgers we ordered were not done correctly, and were closer to well.

Overall, not a great experience considering the choices in the area.    

For the same price as a pretty mediocre, over cooked, burger, you could go to Kuma&#39;s and have a SIGNIFICANTLY better experience.

I doubt this place will be open long."

If you&#39;re expecting BarleyCorn you&#39;ll be sadly disappointed. There is no dancing, instead you&#39;ll find plenty of games.  I mean, games, like bowling, bags, and scrabble.

Sure it&#39;s a cute place to take someone on a date, but not really a place to party.

We did eat, the food was good. I had the grilled cheese, I&#39;d recommend it.  The service is a little relaxed, so order up when you can.

Over all not bad, but not my favorite."

My bill the night I was there for 4 drinks and 4 shots ( with three other people ) was $76. With tip I rounded to $100. After looking at my bank statement 3 days later the charge was for $176.  I contacted them via email and called. No response or call back was giving. Upon looking at my bank statement 2 days later, the charge now was up to $226.  This is terrible business and lacks integrity. 

Everything sucks in this place. All the perks they offer do not work, are not complete ...and is a weak attempt and bringing life to a place where three business&#39;s already failed.  

I have notified  the BBB and will update on the outcome of this terrible experience and waste of time.

Now that thats off my chest there are definitely some gems on the menu and the drink list was decent too. We didn&#39;t get a chance to check out the games/bowling/etc but it gives us a good reason to go back in the neat future.

I ordered the ploughmans platter which was really good except for what must have been roasted radishes (wayyyy too bitter) but there were many other good options including a great cilantro pesto. We also ordered the cauliflower nachos - I&#39;m going to have to try this at home!!! and the mushroom tacos - just ok and nothing to write home about.

The server was a little on the too attentive side - asking to refill have finished beers. But id rather have that then someone seats you and then disappears forever. Nice option for the Woodfield Mall area and a good change of pace for the tons of chain restaurants in the area. P.S. the biscuits and jam to start are a nice touch."

Anyway we went downstairs to play some arcade games.. and bowling and of course more drinks since there&#39;s a full bar in every level..

The first time i sat in the bar with friends and greeted by Laurie, she is very knowledgeable and super sweet and not to mention very accommodating. Great drink list to choose from, definitely will be back to try the rest of the cockails! Loved the decor and style of the restaurant, definitely sets it apart from every other bowling place around. 

Second time I&#39;ve been in I sat in a booth with some friends who i haven&#39;t seen in awhile so it was very important that our experience was great. Our server (forgot her name, sorry!) was super accommodating and we had really great service from start to finish. My friends and I were all super impressed when the manager, who&#39;s name was Dave came to check on us during our dinner to see how we were doing. We all really liked that he shows how much he cares as its hard to find places where the managers do table visits, we all agreed that this shows sincerity and quality in a restaurant. Dave really made sure we enjoyed everything and lastly mentioned to check out the bowling. 

After dinner we decided to stay around and continue our night so we all bowled a bit and had a few more cocktails.  What a fun night, we were all talking about it later how much fun we had that night. Will hands down pick Punch Bowl over Game works and the new bowling spot in wood field mall (257-the pac-man place) each time. 

We will be back for the drinks, food and great service! Thanks again!"

Then I found out that it was located right down the street from my office in the old John Barleycorn&#39;s (which I&#39;d never been to, but heard about). When my friends asked me to meet up for lunch the other day, I suggested Punch Bowl to satisfy my curiosity about the place.

It was NYE and not a lot of customers for the lunch crowd, but I was impressed by the friendly greeting at the door and the funky hipster-like decor. In fact, this place is very hipster, but in a good way. Awesome bar situation and comfy booths and other seating. The waitress was super friendly and attentive, though not overbearing. I hadn&#39;t seen my friends for a while so we spent a long time sitting and chatting and she didn&#39;t mind at all -- told us to stay for as long as we liked (probably would have been a different situation if it was more crowded). 

And the food... my gosh, it was amazing! I had the Very Serious Grilled Cheese, which comes on grilled ciabatta with gruyere, goat cheese, and poached pears. THE. BEST. GRILLED. CHEESE. EVER! My friends had the corned beef hash and the &#34;Standard&#34; -- bacon, potatoes, and eggs. They both said their dishes were fantastic. We all had coffee, though I was intrigued by their extensive drink menu, including the &#34;adult&#34; beverages and otherwise. 

I resolved to come back again, and I did just two days later for brunch and brought the family. This time I tried the hand-crafted jalapeño-cucumber limeade soda which comes in a chipotle-rimmed glass. Killer! My wife had a grapefruit soda, which came with a twist of lime and was tart and citrusy and absolutely perfect. One of my other daughters had the blueberry lemonade, which I didn&#39;t taste, but she loved it. The other one got a Boylan&#39;s ginger ale, which obviously they didn&#39;t make; however, it&#39;s awesome that they carry Boylan&#39;s. For the main event, I had the breakfast tacos, my wife had the corned beef hash, and daughters had the chicken and waffles and the monkey bread french toast. I tasted all and they were out of sight!

The food here is top notch, and I&#39;m coming back to try everything on the menu. The service was excellent, the vibe was trendy and cool and the menu varied and delicious. So why four stars instead of five? Mainly because I could tell that they had only been open a few weeks and hadn&#39;t quite found their groove yet. The staff seemed a little eager to impress, which is not a bad thing, but it felt like some parts weren&#39;t quite finished yet. For example, we didn&#39;t play any games, but we looked around and one of the employees working in the basement said the bocce game wasn&#39;t ready yet. The app-based payment system for arcade games is interesting and I like the old-school arcade games, but it really does feel like some stuff just thrown in someone&#39;s basement without any kind of cohesive flow. Also, though they have some of my favorite classic arcade games from the past, they don&#39;t have very many of them. I can imagined on busy nights, a lot of people will be waiting in line to play the video games, or the other games. I liked the top floor a bit more -- the chairs around the fireplace were kind of cool.

I&#39;ve been to PBS&#39;s other competition in town -- Level 257 -- twice now, and while I like the idea of a Pac-Man-themed restaurant and the service was pretty good both times, I wasn&#39;t that impressed with the food. PBS offers a similar &#34;adult playground&#34; kind of experience, but the food is MUCH, MUCH better and I prefer the overall atmosphere.

In summary, I&#39;ll definitely be coming back. The great food and proximity to my office make this a no-brainer. I don&#39;t know that I would drive out from the city just for the experience, but if you&#39;re in the Northwest Suburbs, I&#39;d definitely recommend it for brunch, lunch, dinner, or just a meet-up for drinks."

After being created nicely and offered to explore we decided to stay and eat. The whole place was dead even for a Sunday.

We sat at the bar on the diner side on the first floor.

There was a short blonde bartender. She seemed busy at first. Apparently too busy to look up at her rail to know she had customers. 

Thankfully there was a great older gentleman server who came over to greet us ( strange a server had to greet bar guests) but he explained everything to us and offered some drinks.

Finally the bartender wandered over and asked what we wanted to drink. She was not knowledgeable on drinks and didn&#39;t seem to think you could add shots to non alcoholic drinks. 

But none the less we ordered appetizers. The wrong food was delivered to our seats and then when some of the right food was delivered we had no silverware or plates.

After starring at the bartender waving her phone Around clearly more concerned with getting a date with a fellow coworker then taking care of her bar..... I walked over to her and had to ask for my silverware and plates. 

After this she was wayyyyyy to attentive. Asking the same question over and over, hovering around instead of checking in. Yet she still had the chance to keep her phone out and attend to the servers who clearly were not managed properly as they all gathered around a table at the end of the bar phones out and not paying attention at all.

When our entrées were up in the window the expo tried to flag the bartender down for our food. Well no dice since once again getting a hook up was more important. So finally the expo had to have a server run our food.

Needless to say she probably could have kept it.... My husband had the Georgia chicken sandwich. The bartender never bothered to ask what side he wanted or if l.t.o.p. was okay.... For a $13 sandwich it was nothing more then mediocre. My Mac and cheese was good but extremely Rich.

The bartender never bothered to ask if we wanted dessert just simply asked if we were done so she could bring the check. Welp with that greeting I wouldn&#39;t be staying anyway.

She then tried to get us to stay after realizing we would have spent more money.


Needless to say the few days nights my husband and I get will not be back at this location. Sadly enough the entertainment looked great but bad service ruins great atmosphere.... especially to two people who have spent most of their careers in the industry...

Good luck to you PBS....."

- They sat 5 of us at a table that originally sits 4 and didn&#39;t bring silverware or water.
- We sat at our table for 18 minutes before anyone (server, busser or manager) noticed us. Had they told us our waiters name, we would have asked someone to get his attention for us. They also don&#39;t wear name tags so no one is clearly identifiable.
- The manager walked by our table without clearing empty plates numerous times.
- We asked them to split the bill using 5 debit cards. They ran my card twice.  I would have corrected them but I assumed it would take way to long like everything else did.

There were 15 of us and we were seated a little bit before 7 pm. Our hostess told us we would have to be done by 9 since another party was coming in at that time. Our service was great! We had two servers who were attentive throughout and kind enough to &#34;split the check&#34; for us. Everyone enjoyed their drinks and their food. My boyfriend got the American Burger and I got the street tacos and we both recommend each! The atmosphere is unique. It&#39;s a fun place to go to grab something to eat, watch a sporting event, host a party and/or hang out and talk and play games. It does remind me of a college bar but there&#39;s a wide variety of people who aren&#39;t college students so it makes for a fun atmosphere! The only annoying part was the hostess, who came over to our table at 9:00 and told us we would need to leave the table since the other party was waiting; well, sure, no problem except we were all waiting still on our checks. She came over again 10 minutes later, and, again, we had our checks but now were waiting on receipts to sign. The slight attitude she had was a bit of a turn-off but the great food and service, otherwise, made up for it! We&#39;d probably go back!"

There are not many mom n pop places that you go to where literally the mom n pop are cooking for you!! 

When it comes to Chinese this is the freshest you&#39;ll find in the area. The prices are very good. Slightly more than your run of the mill Chinese place but only incrementally higher. The quality you get for that very slight price Increase is so worth it. 

The dining room is small and worn down but that doesn&#39;t matter when the food is this good(I usually carry-out anyway). 

If you live in the area. Make this your go to for Chinese. TL&#39;s in Bartlett is good too but the flavor profile is a little different. This place is classic and I&#39;m so glad I found it. Nice people too. Great food.

I have eaten at many restaurants, as I enjoy trying new things, so I am used to stumbling across sub-par food, but this place takes the cake. 

Having discovered Heng through Yelp, I was delighted to find it had so many positive reviews. I called in to place an order for pickup - a lunch special in particular. The time was 2:57. The lady answered the phone with a &#34;Hello? What you want?!&#34; after the line had rang 4 or 5 times. &#34;Uhhh, I want to place an order for pickup,&#34; I replied. &#34;&#34;Fine. What you want?&#34; &#34;I&#39;d like the orange chicken lunch special.&#34; &#34;YOU KNOW WHAT TIME NOW?!&#34; After a moment or two, she shouted at the kitchen in Chinese. After the kitchen agreed, she said it would be ready in 10 minutes and hung up.

Thinking she must just be having a bad day, I went to pick up my food. 

At first, she refused to even give me a receipt. After demanding so, she wrote a receipt on paper with a pen and notepad. Real nice. 

When I finally got the food home, it was the most flavorless heap of trash that I have ever eaten. 
Having grown up in an asian household, I know when rice is fresh. Theirs was not. It was dry, flavorless, and generally devoid of any redeeming factors. It was supposed to be BBQ Pork fried rice. 
The orange chicken was dried out, too, as though it was prepared in the morning and just left under a heat lamp to stay warm until somebody bought it. The chicken itself had very little sauce on it, and what sauce that it did have was dried and crusty - certainly not &#34;spicy,&#34; as the menu claims, nor tasty at all. 
Finally, the egg roll tasted sour, probably left in the back of a freezer without any regard to manufacturer&#39;s expiry dates and pulled out only when an unlucky customer would happen to stroll by. 

To top if all off, the portion sizes were pitiful.
Needless to say, I threw almost all of it in the trash. 


I would go back to demand a refund, but it&#39;s not worth the time, effort, or gas money to have to deal with their horrendous staff again. Once was enough. 

I only hope that by reading this review, other consumers will know to STAY AWAY from this awful hole in the wall &#34;restaurant&#34;."

Although it tasted pretty good, my experience with the other items that we ordered overshadowed the decent egg foo young. I would not order the crab rangoon again even though the filing was delicious. The wonton tasted old and chewy/hard. The only saving grace was the homemade sweet and sour sauce. The egg rolls were pretty good and I would get those again. The chicken chop suey, according to my girlfriend, had a burnt taste but she was hoping that was a one time error. Finally, the chicken fried rice was just ok. I recommend adding soy sauce but good fried rice should stand on it&#39;s own. I&#39;m willing to try them again but only because Chinese places in the Streamwood area are not good. One more thing...Yelp shows that they deliver but they don&#39;t.

Never had wonton soup before, so I can&#39;t compare this to others, but the broth was simple chicken broth which was perfect on a snowy day.  The filling inside the wonton was nicely flavored.  And then the dumpling noodle.  Sorry, but it&#39;s got to be very difficult to get a dumpling noodle inside a chicken broth soup wrong.

The egg roll was densely filled and crunchy, but better than some other Chinese restaurants that I&#39;ve eaten at.

The egg roll and wonton soup stood out the most to me, especially since I can&#39;t remember my main entree, Hong Sue, or something like that.  For a good Chinese lunch during the week, this place is definitely one to return to."

Even though they have only been open for a few weeks I have already been there at least once a week since! The new location is right off 90 which makes it easy to stop after work.  Every time I go in there I receive great customer service, if I cannot make up my mind they always help me choose something,  but they also keep the line moving if it is busy so everyone can be served in a timely manner. 

I have worked in the food industry all my life and sometimes when new places open it takes time for them to get a grip on everything. I can definitely say this place does not have that problem. They know what they are doing and they do it well! I definitely recommend checking out this Jersey Mikes."

We waited for our friends to arrive and were greeted by a friendly server, she brought us some pita bread and dipping sauces while we waited for our friend to arrive, I could have ate just this and I would have been happy, yumm!! 

When our friends arrived we first ordered appetizers. which were Classic Peruvian ceviche, and a cornbread with sauce on top. I was impressed with the ceviche, it was so simple compared to the Mexican ceviche but yet so flavorful. 

We ordered a bottle of red wine, they had a great selection.

For my meal I orders chicken that was rolled up with asparagus and cheese, with a side of Peruvian fried rice. My chicken was juicy and my rice was delicious

I saw my friends ordered a seafood medley dish, and steaks with chimichurri sauce, white rice and plantains. 

Everyone loved their food and had a great experience. I will definitely be back and will bring my family here."

 As far as service, it was lousy today. There&#39;s always a balance with a server, for how many times they check in on you. This server tipped the balance, as he spent more time talking with coworkers, inside and outside,  while we tried to get his attention for water or asking for the bill. He never checked on us once, having perfected the art of avoiding making eye contact.

Ordered the Pervivan Sampler which included chicken skewers (so tender), ceviche (also good), Papa a la huancaina ( boiled potatoes in creamy sauce) and Peruvian tamales.  Favorite was the Ceviche and the skewers for sure.  Even the appetizer portions were huge and we (2 people) didn&#39;t get to finish all the items.

Main course was spicy seafood fettuccine (HUGE PORTION) that was full of mussels, octopus, shrimp, squid, scallops and clams.  It was nicely prepared, and loved the hint of spiciness.  Italian dish with South American flair.  Love it!  Especially for 23 dollars, it was a steal!  My lovely date ordered the Seafood rice which she couldn&#39;t finish also.

Originally we had taken this place off our bookmark list after trying Middleterranean (same owners, also reviewed), but decided to give it a go anyway. 

It was a Friday night around 6:45 and we were able to get in right away without reservations. The service was very good, our waitress was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. Delicious fresh pita bread with some spicy sauces arrived at out table shortly after our order. Unfortunately, the rest of the food was just OK. We started with the Incan Tater Tots. They were cooked nicely but bland. They could have used either some spice or a sauce. My girlfriend had the Parrillada de Mariscos. It had lots of seafood and, aside from the Mahi, it was cooked perfectly. The Mahi though was dried out. Similar to the Tater tots, there wasn&#39;t a lot of seasoning, which is good if you want just a clean seafood dish. I ordered the Brochetas Rio De Janeiro. The steak was cooked to medium as I asked, but there was only one scallop among the shrimp on the other skewer.

All in all, everything was good, not great. We&#39;ll be trying somewhere else the next time we get to eat without our toddler (AKA not rushed, no spills, food still hot)."

The lunch specials are really reasonably priced especially considering how big the portions are, definitely beats going anywhere else! The El Guacho skirt steak sandwich is my personal favorite. It comes topped with cheese and avocado, so delicious! 

If you stop by for dinner you absolutely have to get the Bon Bones, Tamales and the Anticuchos for starters, and the Parrillada Casera steak as an entree. Plus the mojitos are a personal favorite from the bar.

I ordered the Pollo Enrollado con Chaufa and Corte de Entrana Estilo Rio.

However, when I got home and opened my food I was quickly disappointed to see that my chicken was forgotten. I called the restaurant right away and told them that they gave me an incomplete order. The young woman on the phone went to talk to the chef to confirm this and then passed the phone to whom I&#39;m assuming was the manager.

He apologized for the mistake and quickly resolved the issue by offering to deliver the entrée to my home. While I could of been one of those customers that raise hell and demand something free or be rude, I appreciated the customer service and the solution offered. This was my first time trying this place and while my order wasn&#39;t complete, the customer service made up for that.

The salad and house dressing were out of this world and no doubt the best part of the meal.  The main course included a baby lobster tail and mine was completely overcooked and downright mushy.  

Where this meal failed in my opinion is the fixed menu included dessert but did not provide or allow for any choice.  They served a coconut flan and I am allergic to coconut.  When I brought this to the attention of the waiter, he went on to tell me how he never eats dessert.  Hmm.  I was really hoping for a substitution."

Malbec prices were reasonable as was the selection.

Perhaps most annoying was the attitude of the server, Mariah.  Whatever happened to the common courtesy of waiting until dining guests were NOT talking among themselves before speaking?

Rios was pretty quiet when we got there but quickly picked up as the night went on. The restaurant itself is beautiful, and our server was excellent. The food is authentic and delicious!

The drink menu had some delish options I went with the peach mango martini. 

We had an appetizer that was some sort of corn husk with chicken in it I absolutely loved it. 

Our main course was steak and a spicy fettuccine,and a spicy lasagna with steak as well. The preparation was amazing the menu was also bright and vibrant so you can see the dishes exactly how they are prepared. 

The service was great our waiter was very attentive and did not take too long to take our orders and bring us our food. 

We had a couple drinks and ate an amazing dinner and we made it just in time for our movie. I&#39;m so glad that we tried this place out   Although it is tucked away in the strip mall next. To the panera it&#39;s definitely worth a try"

The menu has a wide variety  of dishes. The steak used for the Lomo salteado and steak tallerines salteado was not filet mignon which is most typical of Lomo dishes. So the meat was kind of tough and overcooked. We experienced very poor service from the moment we walked in and waited a long time to place an order, so we opted not to order appetizers so as to not delay the service any longer. We went on a Friday night and it was not busy at all there were still lots of empty tables so not sure why they were having issues.

I&#39;ve been here four times at decent intervals apart, in different seasons, with different sized parties, for different meals, most recently today for lunch.  

:-/  It just ain&#39;t happening.

It looks great.  The patio is nice.  The food is okay...but it just doesn&#39;t reach the level of flavor and service that makes me a regular.  Memorable bits...  first visit was soon after they opened.  We laughed that the waiter had to be someone&#39;s nephew brought into service in a pinch because he was a disaster.  No matter...  Brought a foodie on another visit and I recall him not being pleased to have an unhappy substitution made on a menu item.  I&#39;m remembering the service always being a bit of a challenge.  Food unmemorable.  

Today for lunch we sat outside.  Lunchtime on a gorgeous day and the vacant tables on the patio weren&#39;t ready.  One was a mess and the other wasn&#39;t set up.  Our server came and I asked for a glass of red with a preferred flavor.  She couldn&#39;t make any suggestions.  The manager was brought in to help but I didn&#39;t get the impression he knew any better.  To him more expensive was better wine.  Uh...not always.

We ordered a skirt steak, medium rare.  While decently sized, it was very thin and therefore more like medium to medium well.  Wasn&#39;t very tender either.  Overall the meal was good but nothing to get excited about.

One quibble...  They had a large drink special board facing the patio promoting their $5 mojito.  Yea!  One was ordered.  Only problem?  The sign said, &#34;Wednesday Drink Special&#34;....and it was Thursday.  After a holiday weekend when I&#39;d been out of town for two days it never occurred to me that I was off a day or that they would advertise a drink special to the room a full week off.  They didn&#39;t honor the price.  Our mistake but it angered my dining partner and I thought it was a silly stand to take over $3."

The meal was yummy. Ceviche was good. The entree was a surf &amp; turf. The menu called it stir fried beef with seafood including lobster. I doubted it myself having a stir fried rice beed at a latino restaurant. However, it was very delicious. We would come back again anyway. The dessert was chocolate cheesecake with chocolate ice-cream which was again very yummy, rich &amp; creamy. The meal was also very reasonable $70-80/ per couple excluding tips. We misunderstood their menu at the beginning and ready to drop $80 per person, $160 for the meal. The meal was definitely tasty and reasonable!"

I have tried many things off the menu here and they have all been super good. I have also been here with my boss and a few other coworkers and we have all enjoyed our meals. The Rio&#39;s lemonade is also super delicious. 
The employees all seem very friendly but the service is a little slow which can be an issue when you are on your lunch break  When I order take out it is normally for myself and a few of my coworkers, so I always call first and it usually takes about 15 or 20 minutes. 
On New Years Eve I met my husband there for lunch. We were given the dinner menu when we got there so I asked for the lunch menu. We were told that they did have sandwiches but were not given a reason for this so I assumed they were out of bread. Since then I have spoken to the manager and the owner there and they explained that on holidays they only serve off of the dinner menu. They also said that they would add that info to their website.
The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is that the slow service."

They made them nice and strong. It could just be the particular bartender we had, but hope it is the same the next time we dine here. We started with the humitas de pollo which was light but very flavorful. We split the pollo a labrasa, which was dry, and the house fried rice, which was definitely our favorite. Lots of steak and shrimp in there. One disappointment, the home fried potatoes that came with the chicken were just generic French fries. Highlights were the drinks and the service, they made the food seem all that much better. Probably go back at least for drinks."

I had the tamal, cebiche and papa a la huancaina. Portions were decent but not huge as with other Peruvian (and cheaper) restaurants. Pisco sours were good and strong enough. They also had Cusqueña, which made my day. Waitress was friendly but didn&#39;t understand some things (I guess since we pronounced the dishes in Spanish because we&#39;re Peruvian), and did ask many times how we were doing.

The atmosphere was nice. They have many Peruvian/South American decorations and music. However, the service was slow. The food was good, but I would call it more Latin American fusion than traditional Peruvian. We were really looking forward to it, but walked out disappointed. The papa a la huancaina had a sort of orangey sauce instead of the traditional yellow sauce. The aji de gallina also was orangey red instead of yellow. It tasted nothing like the authentic version. I can&#39;t speak for the others plates, so they might taste more authentic. My husband is Peruvian. We have eaten at other Peruvian restaurants in Chicago, Miami and Lima. Rio&#39;s doesn&#39;t compare in terms of authentic flavor. We don&#39;t live far from Rio&#39;s and were hoping it would be the perfect alternative to having to drive into the city for Peruvian food. However we would rather drive the extra 15 minutes to our favorite Peruvian restaurant, Ay Ay Picante, in the Albany Park neighborhood.  Overall Rio&#39;s has good food, but if you are looking for homemade authentic Peruvian cuisine, Rio&#39;s may not be the place depending on the dish that you choose."

We had a couple of appetizers including a tamale, which was awesome and a ceviche dish that was OK.

My wife had a skirt steak that was very good and the salad was excellent with an interesting mix and greens and a light dressing.

I had a tenderloin and shrimp stir fry dish that had really great flavor but the steak was overcooked for my taste and the shrimp were undercooked, one was inedible.

Their normal bottle of wines seemed overpriced in my opinion for what they were, but we did order a really good bottle of Malbec that was on special and more reasonable.

The waiter was seemed very inexperienced, but I&#39;m fairly certain that he was just new to the job.

Would definetly recommend and will go back to try some other of their wonderful dishes."

What to expect - traffic is usually light (too light for such good food), but the weekend evenings can get busy. You don&#39;t need reservations, but they help on the weekends. Food is primarily South American (especially Argentinian, Peruvian, Chilean) inspired with some Japanese fusion. The restaurant has a good vibe to it - trendy enough at the bar, quiet enough at the tables, nice outside seating area. Their ceviche is to die for, Entrée&#39;s are great - especially the skirt steak and the mixed seafood options - and the bread will keep you coming back for more.

Not enough people know about this restaurant but if you are looking for something a little different and are in Schaumburg, Itasca, Bloomingdale, Lombard, Elmhurst it is worth the 10 minute ride to Lake Street in Addison. This is my must go to destination for clients, friends and family. Enjoy!"

Their menu looked so amazing and the reviews of the fried bread had me very excited. I could hardly narrow down my options to only 1 main course. My family was coming in from out of town and wanted a new and different experience, so I figured Peruvian/Brazillian food would definitely meet that criteria. 

I saw the new discounted appetizer menu on their website.  They were only available until 7pm so I made reservations for 6:30 to ensure I got my butt there in time. My table of 4 was promptly seated in the tiny dining area.  I asked the hostess if we would be able to take advantage of the discounted appetizers or if we needed to sit and have a drink at the bar for that portion.  She had me wait while she checked (suprised by the lack of autonomy given to the hostess).  She came back and said we were only able to get those appetizers (which are not even on the menu at regular price) if we sat in the bar area.  Naturally, I obliged since I already had my heart set on two of them. She mentioned this information came from the manager.  We were moved a whole 10 feet (place is tiny) to a less comfortable bar table. What a turnoff that they would make an issue of this.  

I loved the shrimp claws, but the tamales were just okay.  I ordered the classic peruvian non-alcoholic beverage, chicha morada, which was very sweet and yummy. The main course was good. I split the Moqueca de Pescado &amp; Aji de Gallina with my husband. Honestly, I was slightly disappointed with the meal as I expected more flavor and seasoning.  While not bland, it certainly wasn&#39;t as seasoned as expected. It tasted like they had held back to accomodate traditional American tastebuds.

We got the churros for dessert. They weren&#39;t filled with caramel like the menu lead me to believe. They were okay, but not as good as Mexican churros I&#39;m used to. I wouldn&#39;t recommend them unless you&#39;ve just never had a churro at all.   As with previous reviewers, they were once again out of their traditiona Lucumal ice cream. They may as well take it off the menu if they are never going to have it.  Also, they had a new desert menu released for May and advertised on their Facebook page-none of those items were available. 

It wasn&#39;t until the next day when I realized the thing that now upsets me the most.  THEY NEVER GAVE US THE FRIED BREAD! The appetizer that everyone gets and I was so excited about was never given to us. I can&#39;t beleive it! I wonder if it was because we sat at the bar to get the special appetizers. Wow! If I knew I would have to pick...obviously I would have gone for the bread. What a bummer!

In Summary:
Rio&#39;s, you get 2 stars because of horrible customer service overall and food that, while not bad, just doesn&#39;t meet expectations. You should not have a menu of special appetizers that are only available in the bar, but rather, offer those same items for full price on your regular menu.  You create a difficult situation for a patron to try those items otherwise. Don&#39;t release a dessert menu publicly until it is actually available.  And, most importantly, relax on your strict policies.  I wanted your establishment to become a regular in my rotation of ethnic cousines, but instead I have decided to never come back."

Their flat bread appetizer was served with 3 condiments and all had very good flavor.  The entrée included fried plantains which are often on people&#39;s menus but rarely done correctly.  These were perfect and went very well with the glass of Malbec I had with dinner.  My only complaint is the plating was done so that it was awkward to cut the skirt steak and avoid the tower of rice.  It would have been better to reverse some things keeping in mind the need to cut the steak.  Service was very good and I enjoyed my evening on the patio.

Once I walked in, however, I knew I was in the right place. The ambiance was amazing! Very classy and upscale but still casual enough that I felt comfortable in Uggs.
We started with the steak filled wontons with tamarind sauce. The have somehow excellently merged South American and Asian cuisine and this dish was an ode to that. 
For dinner I had the aji de gallina (chicken in a Peruvian sauce). It was amazing and made me regret filling up on wontons. The black beans I ordered alongside my dish were excellent and very flavorful. The chicken was tender and the sauce was creamy, but not too rich; very complex flavors that did not rely on salt or cheese. I added some plantanos to my dish and I was in HEAVEN.
My husband tried a fusion dish-- the Rios Special Chaufa Saltado. It is a rice dish with steak and shrimp. He isn&#39;t a very adventurous eater but he cleaned the plate! The proteins were excellently cooked and the flavors were savory and slightly sweet.

Healthy portions, excellent food, friendly staff, and a very classy ambiance made for a pleased diner!! Thanks Rios!"

I highly recommend the quinoa salad and it is one of my favorite items on the menu aside from the meat dishes. The service was a bit slow the second time I went to the restaurant, but I think it contributed to the South American cultural aesthetic of the restaurant. I also highly recommend the mojito lemonade, and the mojito, but with coconut rum. The decor of the restaurant is authentic and elegant in a way that keeps the essence of the culture while having a metropolitan, luxurious feel. I would recommend Rio&#39;s to anyone who appreciates a good, relaxed meal!"

The menu has influences from several South American regions.  Some dishes have a Cuban flare.  Your tab will be a little higher than average but the fresh and different dishes and flavors we&#39;ll make up for it.

My only negative comment would be that the kitchen tends to get overwhelmed with even the slightest hint of a crowd.  Expect to wait a little while for meals when it&#39;s busy.

I would recommend this restaurant when you&#39;re in the mood for something different, slightly upscale, and stylish.  It&#39;s a great date night location..."

We love coming to this restaurant because the food  has always been excellent. The complimentary fried yucca bread with various dipping sauces are a perfect start to the meal. Jalea de Mariscos is a great appetizer if you like deep fried calamari and mixed seafood. The Chupe de Camarones is a shrimp chowder that was okay but not as creamy like most chowders I&#39;ve had. Because the dinner entrees tend to be large, we will generally split one dish. Our favorite and go-to dish has been the Corte de Entrana Estilo Rios, which is a wonderful combination of well seasoned and flavorful skirt steak, sweet fried plantains, black beans, fresh side salad, and rice. No matter what dish you go with be sure to order a side of sweet fried plantains, they&#39;re delicious! 
The only thing that kept me from giving Rio&#39;s a five star review is that the level of service can use some refinement. There are times when there are very few customers in the restaurant and it will take quite awhile before a server will take our order or even check up on our table to replenish our water or see if we are enjoying the meal. But there&#39;s been times, where we have had excellent service and our attentive waiter is well-versed with the food/drink and provides accurate recommendations based on our tastes. 
So overall, our experience has been very good and we plan to continue to make Rio&#39;s a regular spot for us to enjoy good food and time together."

Their service was great, they even gave me a free gift when I went on my birthday. 

To start out, the bread and butter: absolute perfection!! I could make a meal out of that bread, butter, and whatever other dipping sauce they served with it. Their steak is always cooked to perfection and their flavors are fantastic.

The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that I went for lunch once and was a little underwhelmed. Everything was delicious, but the rice was a little under-cooked and the shrimp was just a little too cold. But the flavor was still perfect. And my sister got a burger and loved it as well!"

The venue is very nice, both times it seemed a bit quite/slow but it was on a week night.  The food is great!  The menu was easy to navigate, with pictures to make it easier to see what your options are.  Our server was very helpful and personable as well.  The first time I went I had the Aji de Gallina.  This was SOOOO good!  Our server suggested ordering it a bit more spicy and was super delicious.  The second time I had the Lomo Saltado al Pisco.  This was also very good, but I enjoyed the first dish I tried.

We were treating my Mom to dinner and wanted to go slightly classy.  First, the ambience is truly superb.  The room is beautiful and I loved the South American music they were playing.  It definitely had a Sergio Mendez/ Lani Hall vibe.  It really set the mood nicely.
Our food was excellent across the board.  I started with the Cerviche Nikkei and had it with the bits of flounder.  This was very nicely done with a small roasted potato on the side and this delicious Peruvian corn.
My Mom and I ordered the same paella entrée that was filled with shrimp, octopus and scallops.  The rice and seasonings were perfect.  I can&#39;t recall enjoying a paella as much as I did that I had at Rio&#39;s.  My wife ordered the South American / pan-Asian noodle dish and she loved it as well.  I tasted it and it had a succinctly different flavor profile that our paella dish.  I read the criticism from another reviewer regarding the lack of fresh ingredients.  Although we did not order a salad, all of the ingredients in our dishes were very flavorful and fresh.
Finally, our server Christopher was great!  Engaging and attentive, he took care of all of our needs.  I have no hesitation in giving Rio&#39;s 5-stars!"

We never had south American food before and this was great. They served us a fried bread cut into strips with 3 condiments a peppered compound butter a spicy puree and a paisley cilantro compote. My wife had a shrimp and rice dish with plantains and black beans. Only thing she didn&#39;t care for were were black beans. She loved everything else. 

I had the Lamb shank with rice and pinto beans. The shank fell off the bone. No knife needed! It had a nice sauce that was a cilantro base to it that I really enjoyed. The pinto beans were awesome. Never had this style of beans before. Great alternative to Mexican refried.

Couple issues it was freezing in the place they had the lights down so low it was hard to read the menu. The menu is like a photo album and the print blends into the photos. Would have done 4 stars if that was better. 

We will be going back! The food was very good. It was great to have something different that still had south of the border flavors."

We ordered wontons for appetizers, which we gobbled up, and the fried bread they served with dipping sauces was inhaled. Unfortunately, for my partner and I, we got into a discussion that ruined the mood for the night, so by the time our entrees arrived, I lost my appetite. 

I did enjoy the taltrines saltados, but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to finish it; I can&#39;t remember what his is called, but it looked appetizing as well having a spicy fettuccine noodles with steak medallions. In the end, our dinner was ruined by our own accord.

The service was really good and I felt bad that we came across as having a terrible meal, so I hope this somehow gets to him so he&#39;d know it wasn&#39;t his fault. We definitely turned down dessert so we could just get out of there and because the server knew it was our anniversary, he gave us a little gift box, which we just opened and found a cute little couple doll pin and a keychain from Peru. 

We would definitely go back and probably avoid having serious, mood-altering discussions the next time around to fully enjoy the experience."

I had grown tired of the only &#34;latin food&#34; option around here being American interpretations of Mexican food.  That being said, I believe the owners must have something against Ecuador.  Their so called Ecuadorean dish consists of the side dishes served just about anywhere in South America: rice, salad, fried egg.  if they are to call this dish after Ecuador, maybe at least they should investigate the multiple, very unique special dishes served in Ecuador.  For example, they could add llapingachos (a potato cheese mini pancake of sorts) if their intent is to keep the meal vegetarian.  As an alternative, they could add empanadas de verde- another uniquely and truly Ecuadorian choice.  If they want to invest some time, they could pair the sides dishes with hornado or fritada."

I travel very often and being that my father is of Peruvian decent, I always look for great Peruvian cuisine anywhere I go. As I search for this on Yelp, Rio&#39;s came up with 3 stars out of 327 reviews. I thought to myself, we might have a winner and the deal was sealed when I saw Peruvian dishes such as Ceviche and Lomo Saltado. I have never been so wrong in my life and Yelp has never failed me so badly out of all my years of using it as a guide.

I arrive to Rio&#39;s and sat at the bar. The bartender starts small talk and I eventually ask where the chef is from and his exact words were &#34;Our old chef was recently let go and he was from Peru.&#34; Yet he didn&#39;t know where the new, current chef was from. Already feeling like I already made a mistake, I decided not to jump the gun so I gutted it out and order a Ceviche Clasico (classic) for starters. Let&#39;s just say that Rio&#39;s needs to call back and rehire the chef from Peru they let go! Ceviche is a dish that even if it isn&#39;t made that well is very tasteful and delicious...this one was flat out horrendous. I also asked the platter to be a mix of fish and shrimp. The plate only came out with fish and I had to advise the bartender the shrimp was missing. The bartender came back from letting the chef know of the overlooked error and the bartender said &#34;I went back and told the chef about the shrimp and he gave me this for you to have.&#34; It was a small bowl of shrimp &#34;ceviche.&#34; This little bowl of shrimp was even more terrible than the fish Ceviche I previously had. In my book, if you can&#39;t conjure up regular ceviche don&#39;t try making fusion dishes of a classic Peruvian dish that is known around the world.

Next was their $30 Boneless NY Strip...sounds scrumptious right?!?!....WRONG!!! I asked for this beautifully displayed piece of meat on their menu to be cooked medium, like any seasoned for days in aged spices meat is suppose to be. Never have I cut into the first piece of a NY strip and it not drip in juicy, slightly red, watery gravy goodness. It made me question if the steak was good medium at all so I kept cutting. At this very moment, a guy who I assume was shift manager at the time said &#34;is there anything wrong with your steak?&#34; I told him &#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cooked medium&#34; and he glanced at it and said &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, I will get you another one&#34; and asked if medium was the correct cook temp&#34; which I said yes to. He comes back with the same steak butchered....I mean, cut in half,  to show me that the steak was cooked medium. So you can imagine that I haven&#39;t even taken a bite out of the steak and it&#39;s been cut like 5 times already so I am saying to myself...this better be worth the taste. Yet again...WRONG!!! The steak was the most mediocre NY Strip I have ever tasted in my life and instead of $30, it should have been $9.99! I never knew what strip club food tasted like until I ate the steak. Out of frustration and hunger, also being out of town with the urge of just wanting to get back to my hotel, I manned up and just ate the damn thing. Afterwards the same manager guy asked me how was the steak and I told him bland and very mediocre for the price. None of that matter because he still charged me for it which I found hilarious but I felt bad because the place was pretty empty and seems like it doesn&#39;t get much business with the turnover of terrible first timer experiences that happens there. That explains a 3 star rating with 327 reviews.

So I warn anybody and everybody...tread faraway from this location unless you want a horrible outing. Don&#39;t say you haven&#39;t been warn!"

I read some of the reviews and was a bit put off since some of the comments weren&#39;t too positive. We decided to try it anyway and give Rios the benefit of the doubt, and I&#39;m so glad we did!

The staff were all friendly, and our waitress (who also happened to be the bartender, I think) answered our many questions and offered up suggestions from the menu.

I ordered the Rios Ceviche, which was absolutely delicious. It was served with sweet potato and corn. My husband ordered the fried sole, which was probably one of the tastiest fish dishes I&#39;ve ever had. I don&#39;t recall what type of sauce was on the fish, but it was just so flippin good! 

We weren&#39;t planning on having dessert, but our waitress convinced us we just had to try the churros. And wow! Definitely glad we ordered them. 

Lastly, the pricing was totally fair. All the entrees were basically in the $15-20 range. And you definitely get what you pay for. The portions were perfect.

The bowls were very large. Almost too large....I had to take some of mine home and it did not make for a good meal the next day.  The noodles had absorbed most of the broth and it became a sad mushy mess.

I am giving it one star based purely on the fact they did not deliver what I ordered.  

When I called to ask why the Singapore noodles had NO flavor, literally nothing - no curry at all, the guy tells me because I ordered that way.  I did not.  Using the new Eat24 App - It clearly had five levels of spicy, I chose Mild.  The guys tells me that Mild means Not Spicy (hello, no it doesn&#39;t when you have a selection that says &#34;Not Spicy&#34;).  Same thing happened on my Kung Pao Shrimp.

Throwing down 35 bucks and not getting what you ordered, not to mention with literally no flavor stinks. Particularly when they are wrong but not willing to own it.

I will say the crab rangoons I ordered were as good as everyone seems to rave about, but not enough for me to give this place anything but one star.  Threw the two entree dishes away.

House of Pho - learn that &#34;Mild&#34; does not equal dry/no flavor... you all have an option that states &#34;not spicy&#34;."

I ordered Pho Ga and was disappointed. My soup lacked flavor. It was very bland. I&#39;ve never made Pho in my life and I think I could probably make better if I tried.

A great Vietnamese place with comfort and familiarity with gold old fashioned home cooking.

Decor:
The place is very clean and decorated nicely.  It definitely has this Vietnamese feel to it with all bamboo and wall designs.   Very authentic.  The location is also excellent.  Very convenient. 

Service:
Flat outstanding and the waiter was phenomenonal.  Extremely polite and informative.   He was very patient and one of the best waiters I&#39;ve ever had.  Unfortunately they didn&#39;t have the banh mi sandwiches that night since they were busy but he was very polite about it and he apologized, even though he didn&#39;t have to.  

Food:
I ordered the pho with brisket and beef.  It was OUTSTANDING! Granted this the first time I ever had pho but this was excellent.   They serve it with jalapeños, radish, limes and basil on a separate plate.  There is also the coveted siricha in case you want more spice.  They provide a deep spoon, fork and chop sticks.  If you&#39;re not handy with the chopsticks then use the fork.  Just perfect blend of spices and salt. Can&#39;t go wrong with pho especially with the winter coming up.

Price:
Seriously can&#39;t beat this.   Not is only pho only delicious it&#39;s also quite nutritious as well.   For a HUGE bowl of pho it only costs ***drum roll*** only $8.05 after taxes.  Hard to believe but it&#39;s true.  Amazing prices on ALL their dishes as I scanned through the entire menu.

Overall:
Excellent decor, service, food and price.  Will definitely come back again."

I got the vegetarian spring rolls, which are a disappointment if you like crunch and flavor. I could barely taste the cilantro and observed a grand total of three bean sprouts. I also ordered the bun thit nuong cha gio salad, and found the shrimp rather greasy. The egg roll that came with it seemed to be chiefly composed of the wrapper. 

My companion ordered pad Thai with BBQ pork, and we both felt the prevailing flavor of the dish was picked radish."

The cha gio (spring rolls) were tiny and all you tasted was the rice paper. The Banh xao (pan fried rice flour cake) was way overcooked.

This last trip I tried the new BBQ Duck appetizer. Yeah, take that off the menu. Visually and taste wise it was bad. It almost appears as if they took the neck of the duck and cut it up into bite size pieces. Had it been just meat, it might have been ok, but it was honestly 80% bone. It was awful. Potstickers are not good either. Thick, thick pieces of dough with little filling inside.

She didn&#39;t even bother to throw away the already contaminated cups that you probably drink out of and continued to stack them, so disgusting and unsanitary!

Spring rolls. Standard. Comes with some mystery tofu-pork, or shrimp. It&#39;s pretty cheap, at 3.75 I believe... but it&#39;s a nickel-and-dimed portion. Not enough shrimp. a whoooole ton of rice noodle. ask for extra shrimp if you&#39;re smart. and maybe opt out of the mystery meat.

Pho. yum. yum. yum. i only get the steak kind. i think it&#39;s #1. Actually wait. I&#39;ve gotten the seafood version, too. Also good. but duh. They better make good pho. When delivered or takeout, prepare for all your sides to come separately!. They&#39;ll pack the meat, the noodles, bean sprouts, and basil all in differently containers. Takes more work, but preserves the flavor. This is definitely not a meal that must be eaten immediately, if possible. (The beef cooks within the soup.)

Banh Mi. Surprise! this was actually pretty fresh and flavorful. Nice refreshing taste. It&#39;s a smaller sandwhich with toasted (hardy) bread, so it fares well as a snack, or someone with a smaller appetite.  For $4, though, you can&#39;t really beat it. Jimmy john&#39;s and subway sandwiches are definitely more.

OH! and pot stickers are pretty good. Big, fat, and doughy. probably not the healthiest, but these WILL fill.

Here&#39;s my tip, though. They get cranky when you order near closing time, and are likely to miss small things here and there. We&#39;ve been jipped on peanut sauce a few times. the smoothies tend to be icey.  not exactly the best smoothies out there.

I like this spot. Good taste, but limited menu. stay away from the pad thai, salt and pepper pork chop... and idk.  i&#39;d stick with the vietnamese fare here."

And the lunch specials are amazing: for about $7 you get a huge bowl of pho (I usually get beef and brisket) and an eggroll.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The service is also great, but I would definitely recommend more staff.  Often, especially when it&#39;s busy, I only see 2 servers in the entire place, and they run their butts off.  Sometimes that means that it takes 10 minutes for me to get my soda after I ask for it.  I can&#39;t fault the server for that, since he is only one man.  Beef up the serving staff, and this place will definitely get ***** from me.

It is located within a small strip mall near some car dealerships. Parking was a small struggle as there were few parking spots available when we came for dinner. The table we were seated at initially was right next to the window and there was a draft of cold air coming in so we asked to be moved to a different table. The waitress recommended bun bo hue, but both of my parents were disappointed when the food arrived. The meat was over cooked and the broth was not to their liking.

I thought it would be a &#34;good&#34; idea to try it again as it may be that they changed chefs or might have updated their recipes, and to no avail we were again served food with the same quality as before.

&#34;Banh Mi&#34; is a traditional Vietnamese sandwich very simple in it&#39;s contents, but a delicious appetizer nonetheless. My go-to sandwich is the BBQ pork which in most cases is very flavorful similar to the pork chop and rice dish, but they used the same BBQ pork from the Chinese dish, and trust me I know the difference.

I ordered the &#34;Pho Dac Biet&#34; which is a staple in every Vietnamese restaurant.  I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a &#34;pho connoisseur&#34; but, my girlfriend and I eat Vietnamese cuisine at least once a week. The broth itself is heavy with star anise and the ratio of ingredients does not seem to be proportional in comparison to other experiences. They seem to give an over abundant amount of meat and and noodles which I like, but this still does not account for the lack of flavor in the broth. 

Overall I was going to give this restaurant two stars, but after writing this review I decided to reduce it to one. I can&#39;t recommend this place in good conscience; I will just feel guilty on the inside. I can however base my rating on the dishes I&#39;ve tried. Please take into account this is  just for these 2 dishes and I cannot speak for the rest of the menu. 

The &#34;Cafe&#34; traditional Vietnamese ice coffee was decent, but how do you botch coffee?"

I would say their pho is not even close to Asian Noodle House or even the newer Viet House. I only go here for the Vietnamese noodle salads--AWESOME. Big bowl of a great variety that you can just dive in head first---the bowl will probably fit your head unless you are an alien or something. There&#39;s only one place I have had better and that is Dung Gia in Des Plaines. House of Pho could improve by char grilling the pork but if thats what I can get near Schaumburg then great! Fresh ingredients is key for a noodle salad and House of Pho is very fresh. They also have great spring rolls...again fresh and delicious.Oh and make sure you try the bahn mi sandwiches. I love to get the 5 for whatever deal and have them all wrapped up to go. I don&#39;t think anyone has ever disliked these. Fresh baguette and of course fresh ingredients.  I always end up here when I have a craving for noodle salad.

I have never had Pho before &amp; I was instructed to try it because of my love of noodles &amp; soup.

When I said I still wanted it, she asked if I was sure.  Clearly, the restaurant just didn&#39;t want to make this for us for whatever reason.

And though I&#39;m a penny-pincher and will sacrifice quality to save a few bucks, there is no mistaking that Pho House has better service, ambience, and quality than Asia Noodle House.

The pho has been consistently good here and we&#39;ve even had take out that was just as good at home.

One cautionary tale... The curry chicken we tried was not flavored properly and we had to return it. The good news is that the staff was courteous and apologetic and so this won&#39;t prevent us from coming back."

I go here so much but I haven&#39;t written an official review till now, apologies. Admittedly, they have been a bit up and down with the consistency of pho soup as of late, but I just had an order to-go today and their broth was excellent!! It&#39;s probably the best I had from them. Since the broth is the heart of this traditional Vietnamese soup, it is very hard to perfect and only a handful of restaurants make it right. 

For the most part this place have decent food and for decent price too. Pho is what they are best known for, their other dishes on the menu is average though I haven&#39;t tried them all. They also offer some Chinese and Thai dishes here as well and those are decent. Don&#39;t expect as much authenticity because their specialty is Vietnamese food.  Although the owners and staff are not Vietnamese but whoever their chef is, that person makes a very close to authentic bowl of Pho. 

Their Chinese and Thai dishes are good, but you&#39;d have to not be picky or set high expectations. In my experiences, their Pad Thai will run very sweet with a lot of orange food coloring and have more noodles than protein. Their Chinese dishes can be saucy and will vary off from the dishes you are used to. Just know that and come here with an open mind if you are to try other dishes besides the Viet entrees. 

Still, I&#39;ve been coming back here every month for the past two years for a reason. Excellent lunch menu prices (recently changed to be under $8, they used to be under $6). They always have great, friendly service that is always quick (a lot of times our food comes out in 5 minutes).  Four star review goes to them because they&#39;ve been able to keep this up despite an increase in foot traffic. I remember coming here when this place had only about 40 reviews.  

Just this weekend (1/18) they revamped their menu with a different look and offers more information and variety. Check them out if you are in the Hoffman area!"

They also now have a new happy hour menu which ends by 5 PM. I was disappointed not to get my usual dish. So I ordered something else that I have ordered in the past but not too often and they seem to be skimping on some of the ingredients.

The bread wasn&#39;t really French bread. The crust was soft and the inside was dry and flavorless. The carrots, jalapeno, and daikon were fine, but I really missed the onion and cilantro. The sandwich was really kind of one dimensional, which is not what I expect from a banh mi."

Eggrolls were a tiny piece of burnt chewy meat and nothing but shell -- deep fried &amp; oily. I wasn&#39;t even sure of what it was --- had to call the waiter over to verify my &#34;oily burnt round chip&#34; was the eggrolls i ordered... Next --- the &#34;spring rolls&#34; packed packed packed with rice noodles 1.5 piece of shrimp &amp; a slice of &#34;banh mi&#34; meat &amp; a piece of lettuce. Pho was medicore at best -- my husband and I had the luxury to share One fraction of a basil stem &amp; some bean sprouts -- yep thats it...

These people absolutely have no idea how to make Vietnamese food. FYI eggrolls actually should have food inside of it &amp; spring rolls should Not have &#34;banh mi&#34; meat in it.

Oh well... We&#39;ll try again and hopefully it&#39;s better.

P.S. you will most likely have to repeatedly ask for something if you need it even when your server comes around to ask you if you need anything. otherwise try flagging down another server or take it upon yourself to get up and get it yourself."

This spot is just meh. It&#39;s ok, not great not horrible when when it comes to choices in the Chicagoland area for Vietnamese food we don&#39;t have much.

Order the Vietnamese Ice Coffee. Im old school I prefer to get in it the press where you let it steep to your desired level of strength. Here you just get a premixed glass with iced coffee in it. Ugh.

The bun was severely over boiled and the marinated bbq pork didn&#39;t taste very marinated at all.

The one thing we did enjoy was the goi cuon. (summer rolls) The rice paper was nice the vermicelli was much better than in the bun and it had some nice pieces of pork and shrimp. Their peanut/hoisin sauce was ok, but it always made better when mixed with sriracha. 

All in all we would go back but only for the goi cuon. Now sure I would be interested in anything else though."

This is unheard of but it&#39;s true. House of Pho offers a lunch and dinner special that&#39;s available on the weekends that comes with an egg roll and soup. Not only are these deals a steal but the portions are huge. They should really change their name to Giant Bowl of Pho because the portions are enough to feed a small village.

It was a Sunday at 12:30pm and the place was packed. Even though it was busy, we were seated quickly and the food came out within five minutes of ordering. In addition to the large portions, the food itself was good. I&#39;ll admit, my expectations were lower because it was so cheap but the ingredients were fresh and my bowl was full of meat. If you aren&#39;t a fan of pho, you can order bahn mi sandwiches or non-Vietnamese dishes like pad Thai and Mongolian beef. I left the restaurant completely over stuffed and found it hard to button my jacket and ended up passing out afterwards from an MSG food coma. Several hours later, I was still full going into dinner time. 

Surprisingly, House of Pho has gotten better since it opened. They have expanded their menu and business has picked up. In this economy, good cheap eats where you get more bang for your buck is hard to find."

The pho here used to be extremely oily and leave you feeling like you just slurped up a ton of cooking oil.  But they must have changed their recipe or ingredient portions recently because the pho is spectacular now.  The broth is very tasty (can add Hoisin and Sriracha sauce to taste of course) and they will give you an abundance of side vegetables (sprouts, cilantro, peppers).  

In the area, Viet House actually recently opened up, however, I still prefer House of Pho&#39;s pho.  Here is my quick ranking from the area:

The place is nothing to look at. It&#39;s in a small strip mall. The interior is kind of plain. The menu is small. In fact, I decided when first arriving that I really wanted Bahn Mi but didn&#39;t see it on the menu. I decided to order Bun Cha Glo Dac Biet - Vermicelli noodles with shrimp, beef, vegetables, chopped peanuts and an egg roll. The Vietnamese egg roll is smaller than the Chinese one - more on the lines of a Filipino egg roll. The fish sauce was very good. But, I have to say the shrimp were better than what I&#39;ve had in most places. They really were outstanding.

I noticed a sign on the table after ordering that listed their Bahn Mi sandwiches which were not on the menu. We ended up ordering four to take home to lunch the next day. Since I&#39;m writing this after eating one of them, they were quite good.

House of Pho is not as close to my home as To Pho, but not too much further. Prices are about equal. Food quality is about the same, and the selections are pretty close. I&#39;ll try it again to see which I prefer, but they are about equal for now."

I came here on a Sunday with a group of people for a late lunch at around 1:30PM, glad we made it in time just for the lunch special (ends at 2PM).  House of Pho honors lunch specials all week long (yay!)..

Food Food Food!!!

-Pho ($7.00): the regular size pho, you can choose your options of meat and the price is still the same...
-Bahnmi sandwiches (~$3-$4): I tried it before when I came here and it was pretty good..

Big portions on normal size Pho as well..but doesn&#39;t seem that much bigger than the lunch special pho...

Lunch Specials ($5.95) - served with vegetable egg roll and tom yum or egg drop soup

-Pho with choice of beef or chicken with cilantro and onion: tasted good; however, a little oily...so if you like the fat from the meat dripping into the soup (which i assume most ppl enjoy...fat makes things taste better??).. i guess you&#39;ll enjoy the oil in the soup (I&#39;m just not much of a oil/fat fan)...my friend ordered the seafood pho and her soup was definitely not as oily as mine...it was normal...so that&#39;s why i conclude that the oil is from the meat..
**note: they don&#39;t provide you with the additional meat options as they do with the normal size Pho since it is a lunch special
--------the jalapenos were hottttttt....so be careful not to add too much if you can&#39;t handle hotness :).. i guess this can vary tho since they probably buy the ingredients at different times...

-Pork chop with steamed rice: I haven&#39;t tried it, but just thought I would let you guys know what else was on the lunch special...

-Rice vermicelli noodles: a friend tried it and said it was good... it did look like A LOT of food!! 

The portions for the lunch specials were huge..pretty big...definitely left content.....no need to order regular size pho...

Customer Service: was A-OK...

Atmosphere: nice place to come with friends and/or family..it&#39;s a fairly new restaurant so the decor inside is nice... 

--If i&#39;m craving Pho and i&#39;m too lazy to go to Pho Ha.. I would come here again...:)"

I ordered 3 banh mis and 2 smoothies to go. The lady in the front took a phone order around 11:40am while I was waiting. Around that time 3 lunch crowd groups started walking in. At 11:50am I saw a pickup order, but the lady tells me it&#39;s for the phone order and banh mis take longer to make. How does putting a sandwich together take longer than two lunch specials? At 11:55am, I see the server bringing out two banh mis to the lunch crowd group and that&#39;s where I lost my shit. 

I started grabbing my head as the inconsistencies of how they cook their orders was making me furious. My legs started bulging and my shirt was ripping off my chest as I started increasing in size. My skin started morphing green as I screamed &#34;I JUST WANTED SOME FRIGGEN SANDWICHES!&#34; 

I woke up dazed and in front of a pile of wreckage that might have formerly been a respectable establishment. I did however have a bag of banh mis finally in my hand so I guess everything worked out. I put my ripped purple shorts back on, grabbed my bag of banh mis and hitchhiked my way back home."

What I love about Lettuce Restaurants is the quality and customer service. A couple of months ago we were meeting another couple here for dinner. Before we arrived I got a call while we were on our way. They had had an issue and would not have hot food until at least six, our reservation was at five. 

We were able to flip our reservations to Wildfire PLUS they sent us 100 in coupons for the inconvenience. At that point we were like, hooray for inconvenience.

We met there this month and ate our heads off. My BIL and I split a calamari app and it was superb, such light coating. I then had Clam Chowder which was silky smooth with creamy goodness. I had a Lobster roll for my entree because I adore them and no one makes them better. 

Did I then need dessert? Nope. Did I have it? You bet! I had their signature raspberry pie which for a raspberry nut and a pie aficionada was heavenly. I topped it all off with coffee. 

Even with our combined gift certificates they still gave us the Military discount for my brother in law. Wow! And we were sure to tip our server on the original total.

Comfortable seating, classic food and gracious servers all combined to give us the meal of a lifetime!"

Service: our server was extremely attentive and nice! She was very prompt and also did not push us through our time dining. 

Drinks. I ordered the Manhattan and my mother ordered what I believe to be the French 57? Or something....I know it had the word French in it lol! They were both fabulous! Manhattan was deliciously strong, and the French 57 served in a champagne flute and was gin, champagne, and lemon juice with a lemon garnish! 

Appetizers: we started with 3- The Oysters Rockefeller which was OUTSTANDING- this is the place to go for oysters if you like them! 

We also had their signature crab cake- I knew I wouldn&#39;t be disappointed since I&#39;ve gotten this the last 5 times as well and have always loved it! 

And the King Crab Maki roll- $20 well spent as its succulent HUGE chunks of king crab ....beyond delicious. 

Entrées 

I had the Surf and Turf- a beautifully cooked Medium filet with an outstanding lobster tail! I loved everything about this dish! My filet was seasoned perfectly! I did not have to add any extra salt, etc. 

My mother had the Filet and King Crab! Out of this world! A generous amount of crab and her filet too was cooked perfectly! 

Dessert 

We had the crème brûlée! Delicious ! I cannot wait for our next visit!"

We made reservations but on a Monday night it was not that busy. Weekends are another story.

Our waitress as very personable and when she found out we had visited Hungary, we shared our happy experiences and thoughts on Budapest.

We stared out with cocktails that were brought quickly.  Shared a shrimp cocktail (that was delicious when the horseradish was mixed into the cocktail sauce).

For dinner I had the garlic shrimp, Kathy had the seafood salad and Tim had fish and chips.  All were excellent.  They had changed how they cooked the garlic shrimp and it was the best I have ever had outside of the Caribbean Islands.  Butterflied and grilled in the garlic butter.

Since it was our anniversary, they brought us a sample of their most popular desserts.  All four of them were excellent.

This is always considered one of the finest seafood restaurants in Chicago and lived up to its billing.  I highly recommend this restaurant for fresh seafood.

Only minor problem was that the didn&#39;t have Guinness on tap. That would have been perfect with the garlic shrimp.  I am not a fan of bottled Guinness."

For dinner I ordered a wedge salad, which was yummy. It had blue cheese, bacon, tomatoes and the iceberg was crisp and cool. For my entrée, I ordered a combination platter that had grilled shrimp, scallops and filet mignon. The steak was cooked perfectly but the shrimp were over cooked and the scallops were under cooked. The scallops were weird with an odd texture. I don&#39;t thin I would order this again. 

For my beverage, I ordered a Bloody Mary, which was an experience. I love a good Bloody Mary and this one didn&#39;t disappoint. It came with a shrimp, which was soooo good, a pickle, lemon and olives. It also had a beer chaser, which I have to one of my dinner companions. 

For dessert we ordered the sampler, which had 5 different smaller versions of their desserts. Nothing was memorable or worth the calories."

Definitely the best quality in food and service though. Sign up for their rewards card, as it truly helps. My favorite menu item is the lobster roll but it seems smaller than I 
remember it being in past years. Happy Hour can save you a bit but heavy on the oysters. The tuna, avocado and tortilla chips appetizer is great for a small bite too.

Marcos in the bar is THE BEST at what he does and goes out of his way to ensure you always have a drink or are happy with what you&#39;ve ordered. He is always genuinely courteous and attentive too, no matter how busy the bar gets. I am waiting for April and smelt season because they were delicious here when I tried them in the past.

It would say it&#39;s a fantastic place for a celebration. The oysters were really fresh, surprisingly so for Chicago. They tasted as good as the ones I had at the Island Creek Oyster Bar in Boston. We got the sampler so we were able to try all their different oysters. They were all gobbled up and no one complained about any particular one that they didn&#39;t like. The chopped salad was also really fresh with bits of avocado and tomato. 

For the main entree, I ordered the crispy whole fried red snapper. It definitely was an entire red snapper, head and all which was great for me since I&#39;m used to eating whole fish. It had a great crisp on the outside. The only thing I would say that I was a bit disappointed about was that the meat of the fish was a little dry but I guess I&#39;m comparing it to whole fried fish I&#39;ve had at Thai restaurants. I could be a bit biased but at $38, I would just think you wouldn&#39;t want to over cook your fish. Anyways, the thai chili vinaigrette that it came with was a bit tart but helped with the dryness. 

The rest of the table ordered king crab, a seafood combo platter, and tilapia. We shared 2 side orders of lobster mac &#39;n cheese and 1 order of broccoli. Everyone enjoyed everything they ordered as well as the side orders. I was really excited about the lobster mac &#39;n cheese but it wasn&#39;t as cheesy as I thought it would be. Even though there were good portions of lobster meat, the lobster didn&#39;t really taste like anything so overall that was a bit disappointing as well.

Our server was incredible. He was really attentive, engaged in a few conversations with us, and brought me a complimentary piece of chocolate cake for my birthday. It was delicious and I was so thankful that he lit a simple candle in the cake and said happy birthday. There were no awkward and loud singing waiters which made this 35 year old grateful! I would definitely go back for a special date night or another celebration. Stick with the oysters and perhaps choose another seafood dish."

I went about making reservations on Open Table so I could get dining points followed by reviewing photos on Yelp. This always helps me plan ahead, as I have OCD tendencies when I look at the menu. Meaning I have to read everything on it before deciding what to order, which isn&#39;t always the most satisfying for my more impatient husband.

Happy to say that by the time my hubby came home from work, I had our whole dinner ordered in my head. This means more time for drinking and eating and less time obsessing over the menu at the restaurant.

We were greeted by a friendly staff and waiter named Jimmy. Service was on point.

We started off with a dozen mixed oysters for their $1 special hour. A dozen combo oysters are priced at $36 on the regular menu, so we saved $24, woohoo! More money for the amazing &#34;blueberry mule&#34; drink I ordered, which is blueberry vodka and ginger beer on the rocks, served in a copper cup. Highly recommend it!

I paired the amazing table side bread with a cup of seafood gumbo. It was perfectly spiced and meaty with delicious okra. 

Hubby ordered surf and turf with his steak cooked medium to medium well, it tasted perfect! While I went for the more traditional seafood combo with garlic shrimp, seared scallops and Shaw&#39;s renowned crab cake. We got a side of garlic spinach to share. Every item was perfectly cooked and prepared. We finished with our plates cleaned!

Craving for a refreshing dessert to clean our palette, we decided to order the key lime pie to go, to give our magnificent meal time to settle on our ride home.

We had our key lime pie dessert in our warm cuddly bed and we lived happily ever after..."

We have to agree with previous reviewers that Shaw&#39;s is a little pricey, but in our opinion just a little. Our dinner for two on a fairly busy Sunday night easily surpassed $200 but half of that was the bottle of wine we ordered and a generous tip for our server.

The highlights from our meal included the wedge salad, New England clam chowder, king crab legs (possibly overpriced but meaty and delicious), and the complimentary piece of chocolate cake we split for dessert. It was our anniversary...and apparently lots of other people were celebrating things because we saw a lot of cake being doled out around us.

The disappointing items from our meal were the sauteed spinach, which had no seasoning whatsoever and tasted like it had been boiled rather than sauteed, and my halibut, which was a little overcooked and under-seasoned.  (I ate it anyway.)

Our server was pleasant and made sure our water and wine glasses were always filled. That&#39;s more than we can say for the guy who was supposed to do it, who was a little slow. There were also a few awkward minutes before we were seated, when we stood there watching several employees walk by without anyone acknowledging us. Again, these are minor gripes, but for a place like this--at least what it aspires to be--it should not happen.

While the ambiance is comfortable, it&#39;s also kind of dull. The dining room could use a face lift or a fish tank or something. And there was a slight fishy smell permeating the entire room. Again, it wasn&#39;t horrible but it was noticeable. It&#39;s these little things that add up and keep this review at 4 stars."

For our dinner, wife had their grilled Ecuadorian swordfish, and I had their crispy rainbow trout.  The fish servings were exquisite - the swordfish was tastefully blackened on the outside, but was also thick and yet very succulent - maybe the best swordfish we&#39;ve ever tasted.  Wife did not like the giardiniera side that came with the swordfish though.  My crispy trout was just that - with a nice crispy and tasty skin, and a nice side of arugula, green beans, pearled onions, and pistachios.  We also split a nice wedge salad.  Shaw&#39;s is a great place for an upscale seafood lunch or dinner.    Water service was nice and attentive.  You&#39;ll also get an attentive server, but one who is by training likely to ask if you&#39;re interested in this, that, or another thing, which we weren&#39;t in particular.

You cannot go wrong with Shaw&#39;s oysters. They always have a good selection to satisfy your tastes. The cocktail sauce &amp; horseradish is good (just ask for extra horseradish) and the Tabasco is nearby. Most importantly is they shuck them properly meaning cutting them loose from the shell (some places don&#39;t??). People complain about the $3 per but you get a selection and they are fresh, prepared correctly. If you want the best deal around go between 4 &amp; 6pm and order the ones on special. 

Bloody Mary... one of the best I&#39;ve had with a super garnish!! Just make it a double so you can taste the vodka as with any BM...

Sushi here is good but don&#39;t expect greatness. It&#39;s perfect if you just want something small to snack on. I&#39;ve had various rolls many times. think it was a smart addition to the menu...

If you are a fan of oysters, this is definitely the place to go to enjoy them. The menu offers a fair selection of oysters of varying flavores and sizes, and they are all extremely delicious! Certainly worth every penny! I especially enjoy the little cup of flavored ice that comes with it, which I later found out is a champagne and vinegar mixed together and frozen, then chipped off and presented in a little metal cup next to the horseradish cocktail sauce. It has a somewhat sour taste and compliments the oysters very well. 

We also had their lobster bisque soup, which was so good, I was tempted to order another to take home a eat later. I highly recommend it! The shrimp cocktail was also phenomenal. I say it is even better than Bob Chin&#39;s! 

A final thing worth noting is the customer service is impeccable here. We actually ordered one of their cooked seafood platters that came with a crab cake, a lobster tail, and lobster Mac n&#39; cheese. We weren&#39;t particularly fond of it, so we regrettably sent it back. We were so happy with the rest of the food, we weren&#39;t in a poor mood about it. We ordered some more oysters and the King crab bites (which were amazing!), and the manager brought the oysters out herself! She also gave us a slight discount on the oysters. We would have been completely fine without the gesture, but I just thought it was so nice for her to do.

Anyway, I highly recommend this place and will return."

Main dishes included lobster pasta, scallops, and steak n seafood combination platter. Filet mignon was overcooked and sea scallops overly sweet. Garlic butter shrimp was okay.

We are not first timers at Shaw&#39;s but this was our first brunch experience. The food was excellent and I throughly enjoyed everything! 

The cold side of the buffet had fresh raw oysters, cocktail shrimp, sushi rolls, a variety of salads and smoked salmon. All of the items I just mentioned were absolutely delicious. My favorite was the pastrami smoked salmon which had a nice peppered crusting. It was the perfect combination of smoke flavor with a little kick. My mother was enamored with the fresh oysters on a half-shell (east coast) which has always been her Shaw&#39;s favorite. 

The hot side of the buffet brunch had a variety of traditional breakfast items including bacon, sausage, omelet station, breakfast potatoes, waffles, french toast, fried shrimp along with spinach and brussel sprouts. I tried a bit of everything and it was all very tasty. A few king crab legs and lobster bisque also made it to my plate and both were cooked just right with the perfect flavor. 

Dessert was the finish on our brunch experience. The dessert table was a beaituful display of a variety of petite sweets set out to satisfy the sweet tooth of both adults and children. 

The service was exceptional. I made a 12:15p reservation and arrived right at 12p. We checked in and were seated immediately. Our server (Michael I believe) was friendly, informed and very responsive. The vibe was relaxed and a warm environment for families. Most people were dressed casual. Some even in jeans. We will definitely be returning for brunch in the near future."

The dinning room was ok, but I prefer dinning at the oyster bar because the bar is more casual, lively, and sometimes live music is being played. 

This is my go to place for half shell oysters.  I cannot survive without eating good oysters. Their crab legs are also good. Half portion made me so full. Fish and chips are good, too.  Tacos were ok. I also like the plate comes with small filet mignon, shrimp, and scallops. Sometimes shrimp smells like it has been in a water tank. That chemical smell if you know what I am talking about. So I have not being eating that for a while. But I know I will order the plate again someday.

The best oyster bar in Chicago!"

Omelette bar. Sushi. Fresh oysters-typically 3 different choices. Shrimp cocktail. King crab legs (pre-cracked so easy to eat). Lobster Mac &amp; cheese. Candied bacon. Crab cakes . Parmesan crusted haddock on a bed of spinach. Lobster bisque.  Don&#39;t forget the huge dessert table with cupcakes, tiramisu, creme brulee, and more!

We chose to sit at a table in the bar area, which we prefer.   Started off with the Shaw&#39;s Bloody Mary, which was very good.  Moved on to the raw oysters and Florida crab claws. Both were excellent.  My husband ordered the whole red snapper for dinner, it was cooked to perfection.  I chose the seafood salad.  Happy to report it was a very pleasant experience!"

Upon arrival, I did bring my kids with in a stroller and was rudely told that there are no strollers allowed in the main dining room (where I had made a reservation) and then they shooed us off to the Oyster Bar. I mean, I get it kids can sometimes be trouble but this isn&#39;t a 5 star Michelin restaurant where kids shouldn&#39;t be allowed in the main dining room. I then proceeded to ask if I can put them in high chairs if that would be okay. The hostesses kind of nodded and once again hinted that we belong in the Oyster bar. Ouch, talk about a slap in the face. I should have walked out right there and then but I decided to make the most of my experience.

Upon sitting in the oyster bar, our server approached us and he seemed nice. He brought out some cold sour dough bread which was such a turn off since shouldn&#39;t a nice place at least have warm bread? And where was the bread basket that I guess only people in the dining room get. Well, I still asked for that bread basket. It was brought out in like 20 minutes and there was only one roll even though the server could clearly see it&#39;s not a table of one and once again the roll was cold and hard. Like wow, worst bread basket experience. Everything else seemed to go downhill from there, didn&#39;t care for the lobster bisque,, the oysters although happy hour price weren&#39;t fresh in my opinion and we got these super tiny ones. Then it gets better, the fried seafood sampler was tiny. I mean for $16 (per person, what a messed up rule) you get one crab cake the size of a quarter, two shrimp and a few calamari, I mean that&#39;s just a waste of money. Maybe if I ordered just the calamari the portion would have been decent. 

Then my husband and I decided to each order the $24 lobster rolls and we both hated them, the bread wasn&#39;t warm and not super fresh and the lobster meat was a pink neon like color, I don&#39;t know what that was and I&#39;ve had my share of lobster rolls whether in the east coast and in Chicago and this is the absolute worst one I&#39;ve ever had.

I really am thankful I didn&#39;t splurge further on the king crab legs based on the poor quality of everything else, ugh gross. But of course I decided to still get dessert. They get a star for nice presentation for the dessert sampler which had key lime pie, cherry pie, mini creme brulee and a chocolate cake. The only star is for presentation because everything else was just eh, and I&#39;m a dessert person meaning it doesn&#39;t take that much to impress me as I love me some oreos out of a box, but oreos out of the box would have been more satisfying than what we had. I left extremely disappointed since the place is not cheap and I was kind of appalled by the poor etiquette of the hostesses. If she didn&#39;t want us and my kids in the dining room, she could have at least been nicer about it. I don&#39;t think I will be back."

Two of us dropped in for lunch.  Here&#39;s what we had:
1 - Margarita
1 - Lagunitas
1 - Iced Tea
1/2 dozen Oyster Sampler ($18)
1 - Seafood Salad ($22)
1 - Alaskan Sockeye Salmon ($28)

Total bill before tip = $98.37

All of the food items were excellent, absolutely no complaints with the quality of the food or the preparation.  The Sockeye Salmon is a seasonal special.  For lunch, you get a 6 oz piece of salmon with a ridiculous frou-frou side salad that is more of a garnish than a side.  Service was top-notch as usual.

I can&#39;t rate higher than 3-stars due to  the price/value quotient.  Yes, I know that you are paying up for the ambience and it certainly is a nice dining experience.  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t justify these prices.  I have been grilling wild, Alaskan salmon, when in season, for over 6 years.  Sure, Shaw&#39;s preparations are more consistent but I can buy 5 times the amount of salmon at Whole Foods when it is on sale.  Sorry guys but I will only be back for 1/2 off oysters happy hour."

Very pricey so if you&#39;re in a budget, skip this place. The moment you walk in, you know you&#39;re in a seafood restaurant as the fishy smell greets you. This was my only gripe about this place. I would&#39;ve given this 5 stars for the taste and quality of the food (for a Midwest restaurant) but the fishy smell and the selection made it 4 stars for me. Look, if you want the best and fresh seafood, Midwest is not the place, you must go to the coasts (east or west).  This place will do though if you can&#39;t travel to the coasts. 

I have had their haddock ($26)in the past and that&#39;s 4 stars. This visit, I tried their lobster roll ($24) which is served on a Texas toast pocket with  a side of cole slaw and French fries. It was good and if I ever come back to this place, I will have it again.  In the past I&#39;ve also tried their sushi and that was good as well. I&#39;m too cheap to try their crab legs for $65 pp. 

Their dessert sampler came with samples of cheesecake, key lime pie, creme brûlée, and cherry pie. MUST HAVE!  Perfect serving for 2 people. 

Enjoy!"

I recently went for a late dinner and ordered the Bloody Mary.  It was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had - even better than Chad&#39;s!  Sorry, Chad.

About 4 years ago, I drove a cake from Carlo&#39;s Bakery in NJ, back to IL.  We were having my daughter&#39;s birthday dinner at Shaw&#39;s and I asked about bringing a cake.  There was a cake slicing fee per piece but after I explained what I paid for the cake and the lengths I went to get it back here, they kindly waived the fee for us.  I was most appreciative and I&#39;m sure we more than covered that fee by what we all ate and drank.

All and all, I would suggest this establishment.  Lettuce Entertain you typically has a very nice sale (last I remember, it was purchase $200, get $50) on gift cards around the holiday season and they are perfect gifts for family, friends, teachers, etc. and even yourself!"

We arrived a little early for Happy Hour so we started with Oysters Rockefeller,  Lobster Bisque, Calamari and soft shell crab for appetizers.  The Rockefellers were rich with spinach and light on cheese, a more refreshing profile than usual.  The Lobster Bisque was rich and the grandchildren enjoyed dipping the sweet rolls into it!  The soft shell crab was large with a tasty salad.  The calamari were tender, but a little large for the grand children.
The one disappointing dish was the Seafood Cioppino linguini.  Our daughter-in-law was hopping for a San Francisco style brothy ciopinno and instead got a rather dry Seafood Pasta!

As for the oysters on the 1/2 shell we consumed 6 dozen, so I&#39;d say we liked them.

Finally when we arrived there was no room in the Oysters Bar so we were given a table in the near empty Main Dining Room.  At first the waiter said that the Oyster Happy Hour was only good in the Oyster Bar, but he thought management would accommodate us.  Of couse they did.  Given we were only one of two tables occupied the service was unusually slow, Matbe because it was 3:30 PM on a rainy Saturday!"

We opted to do the all you can eat crab buffet and we were seriously unimpressed. First off, the service was bad yet again. I understand not needing constant attention at a buffet but our server was no where to be found most of the time. It took about ten minutes upon being sat before she showed up then another ten minutes to get our drinks out to us the first time. We ended up asking the bus boy for drinks or to at least find our server on several occasions. Now, this really frustrates me considering this is exactly what happened at the other location.  

As for the food. The hot items were cold, the crab cakes had so many shells in them they were impossible to enjoy. The crab tartlets were cold, the salads were warm, I mean get it together people. The selection was very minimal and the crab legs that were supposed to be amazing were not. They were tough and sort of chewy which meant they were overlooked. I liked how they cracked the shell on them but they just were not very good. For a restaurant to be called a crab house it was sad.  I will say that the dessert table, which had more items than the dinner table, was very good. There were a few things that were tasty but I did leave Shaw&#39;s disappointed (yet again) and a bit hungry. I expect more from a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant but it looks like profit is their most important concern."

I work in a small office and one of our partner company&#39;s had some associates coming to visit us and take us to lunch. We usually hit the same old steakhouse around the corner from the office, but that&#39;s boring. So a couple of us talked it over and decided Shaw&#39;s was a perfect lunchtime spot for this particular group.

We arrived midweek right at lunch with a reservation. Our server took great care to get our orders right and get us out the door at the requested time. That made the team happy. Getting things like straws, extra napkins and the like proved a bit more difficult. 

The atmosphere and noise level were just right for a business lunch. There was plenty of elbow room around the table. I would go back for those reasons in a heartbeat. Plus there was valet parking in one of Schaumburg&#39;s most crowded parking lots. All good things. 

The food. Yeah, we tore that up. Can&#39;t sugar coat things like this. We ate like we had never seen food before. We started with the crab fingers. They were served on platters of ice with lemon and a zippy dipping sauce. The crab was good, but I really enjoyed the sauce. The fried calamari made its way around the table and it was very good. Lightly breaded. Not overcooked. The seafood sauce that arrived with it had a gelatinous consistency and didn&#39;t really adhere to the calamari so I have up on that sauce rather quickly. A few people had the lobster bisque, but said the consistency was different and they didn&#39;t love it. I&#39;ve never had it before, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to provide a good comparison. The crab cakes and the garlic mashed potatoes were delightful!  The caramelization on the garlic made it practically sweet!  Soooo good!  The seafood salad looked gorgeous and huge!!  

Now, for you non-seafood eaters...there are a few options. My coworker absolutely will not touch seafood and she was nervous about things like her French fries tasting fishy. She was my official/non-official non-seafood eating correspondent and she wanted me to be sure to mention that the fries were great and there was no sign of seafood on her plate. She really enjoyed her burger and was pleased with the entire meal. But there were no non-seafood appetizers to speak of. 

Overall, it was a great lunch. I had a tiny bit of shell in my crab cake (and a coworker did in her&#39;s too), but other than that, I really had no complaints. I really want to find a reason to try the $52 Sunday brunch. Maybe I&#39;ll get a gift card as a gift someday..."

Yes, I am an oyster lover.   Always fresh, always get the 2 or 3 variety, they have half off oyster nights between 4-6, and .50 oyster nights!!  How great is that? You don&#39;t have to pay full price!  Oysters are not always huge, blue points are larger than the riptides -  but they are always tasty, briny, sweet and just mouth watering delicious. They now offer 6 oyster varieties!!!  Connecticut blue points - large &amp; meaty with a mild briny finish, Katama Bays, Calm Cove, Oakland Bay, Barron Points (sweeter finish) &amp; Riptides....mmmmmmmm.

I&#39;ve tried many different menu options as well...sushi is pretty darn good.  Scallops entrée way over priced, fish &amp; chips very good, but again, over priced, seared tuna delicious, lobster tail, crab legs. If you love seafood, you won&#39;t be disappointed, it has been consistently good every time I&#39;ve dined here, I just think Shaw&#39;s leans towards the overly pricey side on many of their entrees...I could eat 2-3 dozen oysters here and call it a day.

Saturday Grand Buffet visit - Worth it.  Sure it gets expensive (~60+/person with tip-tax), but when one have that seafood craving, this place definitely hits the spot!  

Oyster special hours note:  daily 4-6 happy hour is legit, but for some odd reason, during 1$ 1 hour specials, something seems amiss.  How is it possible that there&#39;s some sort of shell gunk/crap on 1/4 of the oysters being shucked?  I would understand if speed resulted in a few oysters having gunk, but the day I went ending up being a winter storm (a lot less customers) so how can the preparations be so...

In terms of Oyster Specials, still hard to beat their quality in the burbs, or at least I haven&#39;t found a place short of shucking them myself.

Note:  Supposedly they will be implementing drink specials in the future - can&#39;t wait!"

Came with the family to celebrate and use our lettuce gift card. We sat in the casual dress code section and the place does have a neat interior. Bar in the center and booths/tables are surrounding it, the place is decorated with a upscale beach shack dim-lighting vibe, if that makes any sense.

We ordered Chilled Alaskan Red King Crab Bites to share and my god it was pricey. $26 for around 10 small pieces of crab that tasted mediocre. Good thing there is a 50% appetizer for yelp check in though, so the price was justified. The jambalaya was also just fine, nothing really stood out about it. The stand out dishes I thought were the Lobster, Brie &amp; Cavatappi Pasta and the Seafood Salad. The pasta was so creamy and the lobster on top of it was good. The seafood salad is very clean topped with tons of chilled seafood on top. I&#39;d skip the Sea Scallops and the Seafood Pasta here. There were only 5 scallops with no other sides and the seafood pasta you should be able to get elsewhere. Service here was as expected. So we ended spending around $40 a person for just slightly better dishes with some seafood. My verdict: other places with some quality food with lower price points."

Drinks were spilled on 2 members of our party after the appetizer&#39;s. Yes he apologized but it did not make up for the hours we lost.

We came for brunch, the selection was sub-par and what I did get was terrible. Eggs Benedict were cooked all the way through, there were black flakes of something in the milk, bagels were bad. Bloody mary was amoung the top 10 worst I&#39;ve ever had. You can&#39;t really mess up crab legs at least. For $65 per person anywhere else would probably be better."

As a new resident of Schaumburg I figured it was the perfect place to celebrate my wife&#39;s bday. I figured wrong.  Though the place looked identical to the one in the city, everything was just off and I left thinking &#34;wow, that was the most disappointing $200 dinner I&#39;ve ever had.&#34; Dont get me wrong, it wasnt BAD, it just wasnt good, and certainly wasnt worth $200.  The portions were tiny (except for the crab legs) and the food quality was average at best.

We split the seafood appetizer platter for $22/person. The portions were so small  I literally could have eaten 10 of these.  In addition the lobster tail was rubbery. 
My entree of soft shell crabs was too salty and at $36 for just 2 crabs was more like an appetizer, albeit priced as a dinner.  My wife&#39;s $44 entree of crab legs was tasty.

On a final note, I asked to taste several wines before I chose a $50 bottle.   The waitress seemed perplexed; &#34;you want to taste all these wines?&#34; Um, yes, isnt that standard practice?  She returned with 3 glasses that appeared to have enough wine in each for an ant to taste.  Gee thanks.

MEH perfectly sums up our dinner at Shaw&#39;s."

We had reservations but had to wait until the exact time to be seat. This was our first visit to Shaws and I have mixed feelings about this place. 

The food was average... I did like the opportunity to try oysters for my first time but there were only 2 types of sushi rolls. The better of the 2 was the sweet potato roll. I felt the hot buffet was rather lacking while the au gratin potatoes &amp; waffle was great. The crab cake was dull and other items weren&#39;t too appealing. I came for seafood. One suggestion I would make is to have slices of lemon next to the hot crab station near the butter. 

The layout of the buffet was a bit annoying due to having to walk through the reception area to get to the cold bar items. The chocolate fountain next to the hostess table was a terrible idea as it crowds the already packed waiting area. 

Lastly, I felt our waitress had a bit of an attitude. She was quite moody the entire time and did not check on us during our time to see if we wanted drinks other than alcoholic ones. So so much for unlimited teas, coffee, and soft drinks. She also gave attitude when we asked to split our check, there was only 2 of us. And there was no crab fork at our table nor did she come around enough to check on us. When we asked her to take a photo she was less than enthusiastic. So maybe since she knew the price of the meal would&#39;ve been decent enough she didn&#39;t have to actually provide pleasant service. I&#39;m debating whether the brunch is worth $52 a person."

The food was good, the wine was good.  However, our waiter Tim F was not. When asked a question he acted put out and answered with an attitude.  The original person who poured our water asked if we wanted a drink, we said yes please. He then asked the kind and then Tim F walked up and took over. When we repeated the wine we had just ordered he said &#34;we don&#39;t carry that wine&#34; Oh, the other gentlemen said you did. He made a horrible face and snarled, we don&#39;t even know what country he&#39;s from.  Not sure he speaks English.  That was so mean and rude. We asked to please make sure our one friend gets all the points for The Lettuce Entertain Group. He again, snarked maybe, maybe not, the computer does it.   It was uncomfortable every time he came to the table. He was unfriendly, sarcastic, and rude throughout the whole dinner.  When we asked for a second glass of wine he made a remark that he can only bring one at a time or he could be arrested if two classes were in front of a customer. Maybe that&#39;s true but there are nicer ways to say something. 
I looked for a manager to make a complaint. Was not successful in finding one. It was obvious to all of us Tim F is tired of his job. He took an evening with girlfriends and made it unpleasant"

First of all, I am normally a huge fan of Shaw&#39;s restaurant so my expectations were set pretty high.  The buffet price of $69.00 is a pretty hefty price so I expected a much better quality and a much broader selection especially with the &#34;Shaw&#39;s&#34; name.  I was completely looking forward to shrimp cocktail as that is advertised however it was peel and eat shrimp. This is not even the same category.  I am in the seafood/meat business so I understand cost effectiveness. However, it wouldn&#39;t cost much to put out some peeled and deveined shrimp.  Even casinos put that out at a much lower cost.  Also, the king crab legs were definitely Browns not Reds so they were salty and fishy tasting. And they were small 20+.  I would expect at least 12-15 at that price point.  Not at all what I expected.  Also, the restroom upstairs was so dirty and in need of an update desperately.  The only part of the tiny buffet that was nice was the sweet table.  They did have east coast and west coast oysters at the buffet however I am not a fan of oysters so I can&#39;t comment on those.  

Also the coffee I ordered with my dessert was completely weak and Luke warm.  The check was $188 for my husband and I (2 buffets, one martini, glass of wine &amp; cup of coffee) Would of enjoyed dinner downstairs much better at that price point.  


Update:

Management contacted me and sent me out some gift certificates to come enjoy an a la carter experience which was 100% better.  I definitely would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy a great seafood dinner at a classy restaurant.  Very much appreciated will definitely return!!!"

There was a time that I didn&#39;t like Shaw&#39;s as it used to get me sick from being so rich with butter. However, good thing that I didn&#39;t completely scratch them off my list as it did get better, and I do not get sick anymore.

Their fish dishes are always pretty good. Love ordering oysters and some of the sushi selections as well. If splurging, I could work and gnaw on a lobster forever, and It&#39;s good. Really good. As part of Rich Melman&#39;s vast enterprise of Lettuce Entertain You, their food is standard Leye quality which is usually above average any other chain restaurants. Of course some of Leye&#39;s places like Tramonto restaurants or RPM are much higher standard. Shaw&#39;s maybe just a bit below them but comparable to like other chain steakhouse and seafood places like Capital Grille or Morton&#39;s. Being quite pricy, it better be good.

I took my close friends here for Thanksgiving dinner. With our trip to Toronto didn&#39;t come to fruition and not enough time to prepare for cooking the meal, we just decided to vedge out and eat out. The buffet was impressive for $59 per person. Pretty pricy at the end for me to pick up the tab, but you definitely got what you paid for and money well spent with great friends. 

The cold area was filled with mountains of succulent good size shrimp cocktails, several types of oysters, sushi, snow crab legs, and four different salads. The hot buffet had all kinds of sides and seafood items like candied sweet potatoes, roasted Brussels sprouts, wild rice with cranberry, cauliflower au gratin, salmon, jumbo fried shrimps, green bean casserole, roasted new potatoes, mashed potatoes, crab cakes, etc. Main entrees include beef tenderloin carving table, turkey carving table, and Alaskan king crab legs with drawn butter.

Desserts... Ah so many things. A couple that stood out were the candied apple bar, bread pudding, pumpkin pie and crème brulée.

I thought all the seafood selections were phenomenal. Yet, the Thanksgiving menu were kinda a let down. King crabs were so good as well as the jumbo fried shrimps, shrimp cocktails and oysters. The tenderloin was also superb and cooked perfectly medium rare. However the turkey was dry. The green bean casserole, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin pie were meh at best.

The service was impeccable though. It usually is. It was still a very nice Thanksgiving meal and we all had plenty to eat. Wish we could eat more to make it worth the cost. Worst part was the 10% sales tax in Cook County that just added so much. Plus tip, that was 30% more than the cost. Ouch. I almost forget already about IL tax but now I&#39;m completely reminded."

First thing is the reservation. They do run out of seats (at least they did on our last attempt) so a little planning ahead will be required. I&#39;m pretty sure a reservation is required. 

Next and most importantly, the FOOD! It&#39;s fantastic. The king crab legs were wonderful, super tasty...like butter! While the are all you can eat, they do serve them to you at the buffet. They will give you as many as you like and the guy serving never felt like he was judging me (and I&#39;m an eater).  The other items on the buffet were also top notch, oysters were great, peel and eat shrimp were large and tasty, the beef loin was very well prepared and the desert table was quite yummy. 

The ONLY reason I did not give this place all 5 stars is the price. It&#39;s currently set at $59 per person. For me, that&#39;s tops I&#39;m gonna pay per head (just me, I don&#39;t know your life or your budget). When walking out I noticed a flyer for the buffet that said $69, so my guess is in 2015 the price is going up. I understand seafood prices are rising, but personally that&#39;s too rich for my blood, I&#39;d be more likely to just order a dish in the dining room, but I will be back."

We were sat right across from the bar on a sat afternoon/evening. This is the bar area in the dinning room. It was loud and busy! Our waiter was also the bartender. At not fault of his our service was below average. I couldn&#39;t get a drink refill in a prompt manner. Actually got up twice myself and asked him to refill my glass. We asked for the tomato on our salad to be placed on the side, it never happened. I ordered the crab and filet oscar style. My steak was raw in the middle. Cold! I had asked for med-well. The crab portion was a skinny leg and a claw. Once I was able to get somebody over to our table they took my steak back and it was over-cooked when it came back out. By that time my guest was half way through dinner. I was hosting a business dinner for a client and it was so loud that we couldn&#39;t talk. This area is also the &#34; hang &#34; out area for the rest of the staff. Needless to say I was very disappointed in a place that I normally love to dine  at."

The most recent time was just 2 weeks ago or so. This past time I went with my boyfriend. It was his first time. We ordered a big bowl of clam chowder each (this was a bad idea -we should have just ordered a cup each.) It had good flavor but needed salt and pepper -we lived in Boston for a while and we can be tough to please in the chowder department. This one was solid but not the best ever. Last time I was here I thought it was one of the best chowders I&#39;ve ever had... Maybe it was just an off night for the chowder.

Crab cakes for an appetizer: just ok. Came with a nice little greenery. Ok sauce. Probably will try a different app next time. 

Entree: I had the accopolco  (sp?) roll and the firecracker roll (or something -I can&#39;t quite remember the name.) I like the second one a lot but the alcopoco roll was blah. It had lettuce in it which made it a mouthful to eat and took away from the flavor.
My boyfriend had the fussili pasta dish with lobster and it was outstanding!!

Our server was nice but fairly frantic the whole time. Once the dinner rush cleared out he was cool and chatted with us about where they get their ice cream.

We got the peppermint ice cream which was really amazing. 

I will definitely be back soon."

Phil was our server and he was fantastic. He made great recommendations, and was the perfect mix of attentive but not overbearing. My date ordered a Manhattan from the bar and it was so good she got another. I had the &#34;fling&#34; (grapefruit, gin) and it was also delicious - it&#39;s on the sweet side so bear that in mind.

We split a couple of entrees (hey! no splitting fee, yay!) that were very very tasty. I think that lunch is the way to go; the dishes are a little cheaper, restaurant not so crowded, etc. We had a great experience and will definitely come back."

I&#39;ve been excited to go to Shaw&#39;s for about 2 years. It&#39;s always been on my list of must-try places. So I placed a reservation for the crab buffet on Saturdays. My party of 5 arrived and we are immediately seated (we made reservations weeks in advance). Much to my surprise we were in a private room. We were there for a birthday dinner so it was very intimate, which we appreciated. Everything after that was downhill. Our room was so cold that the drawn butter solidified.  The food was so disappointing; everything was bite-sized and bland. The only thing we actually enjoyed eating were the king crab legs. Although...one leg was cut into three pieces and the chef served you 3 pieces at a time. The buffet is definitely not worth $69. We all wished we&#39;d ate the food on the main dining room menu instead. However, I&#39;m not too sure that I would have like it based on the flavor of the dishes we did try. We ordered 3 shots of patron. We did not ask for them to be chilled nor were we asked but the bartender decided to chill them by shaking the &#34;patron&#34; with ice in an effort to chill them. The shots we had tasted liked water with a splash of tequila. After bringing it to our waitress&#39;s attention, she was able to remove them from the bill. I&#39;m probably not going to come back and I&#39;m pretty sure the other 4 people I was with won&#39;t either.

Food:
Calamari: tasted good.. but towards the end.. i felt like some of the pieces I was chewing on was sand?...definitely don&#39;t enjoy eating sand...

New England lobster roll ($22): it tasted ok, but definitely not great.....Da Lobster has better lobster rolls for sure....

Shaw&#39;s chopped seafood salad ($22): not worth it for a salad...the portion is big though...just a regular salad with seafood....

Customer Service: it was ok.. the waiter was kind and informative...

Wait time: 20 mins to get seated...~20-~30 mins to get food

Would not come here again for food.. the cost and quality do not match up...."

If you need a reason to go to Schaumburg, this is it. The best $60 per person you will spend. Fresh seafood, excellent service, and you will leave full and happy. The king crab is my favorite by far between it and the dungeness and snow crab. You don&#39;t need the butter, but it&#39;s in a warming pot at the end table. Oh, and the potatoes au gratin, while taking up some crab space, is super tasty! As is the crab cake, and the crab and artichoke dip you get at the beginning of your meal.

For some reason there were some issue with the reservation when it was updated online and we ended up sitting at the bar (but later on was transferred to a table). It was to accommodate us since we drove all the way from Bolingbrook and Chicago.  We all know what buffet is so we were all looking forward to it. As we went to the room and saw the food, we were a little bit disappointed. The items didn&#39;t look as much as how they presented it on the menu list. The set-up look more like of how Hors d&#39;oeuvres are set-up, more of appetizers feeling. The beef tenderloin are more medium rare to medium. There are no other options as the chef stated, that&#39;s all they have. Crab legs are hidden behind him and you had to ask for it . He will give few crab legs but will add more if you say, can you add some more. Then he will add one piece and we felt like begging so we just decided to go back if we wanted more. Almost everything felt it came from the refrigerator except the coconut shrimp (fried), pasta, chicken and the beef tenderloin.  For the price of $60 as noted here, we were expecting more of quality food. So we thought, desserts would make up for it. There were a few choices but we all love creme brulee. It was just ok, barely and glazing should be a little crunchy but it was cold therefore the glaze was a little watery already. The creme was just a little creamier than the pudding. Only gave us the impression that it must have been on the ref or chiller for sometime. At the end, it was nothing to brag about. The Royal Buffet down the street would have been more satisfying. We now asked for the check and came out to $409+, (5 buffet, 2 sodas and 4 coffees). We saw that the buffet was $69.00 per person instead of the $59 noted here. We asked our waiter and we were told it&#39;s always been $69.00. We ended up putting in almost $100 each and the experience was not worth it at all.  Maybe the restaurant downstairs would have been better for the price we paid and location was not even downtown."

Given the timing of our meal, we were seated in the bar area.  It was busy.  Our waitress was busy, pressed to pay attention to perhaps more than one table than she should have--result: slow service at our table.

Seafood anywhere is pricey.  So Shaw&#39;s entrees are pricey and the items are noteworthy by description.  It just doesn&#39;t taste like they are fully delivering on the items offered.  

I had the fish special which wasn&#39;t special.  Great by menu description, average in taste.  Dry, not moist.  (Had it warmed under a lamp, waiting for our waitress to serve it?)  The sides were passable, but on the cool rather than warm side of passable. 

My wife had a seafood salad.  Nothing special.  It took time to catch the eye of the server to request more salad dressing and it took more time to get it. 

Just average food.  Too bad.  The ingredients and the description suggest that much better is possible.  It doesn&#39;t seem that it&#39;s being delivered."

All the cold items are in the bar including items like half shelled oysters (east &amp; west coast), smoke salmon, prosciutto style salmon, cold snow crab legs, sushi rolls. They are the stars of the brunch. There was a kid table too with kids friendly items. The other side of the dining room has all the hot items. King crab legs, roast beef and lobster bisque at chef&#39;s table, as well as cook-to-order omelets. King crabs are okay, they don&#39;t taste particularly fresh, personally I find them a bit salty. Other hot items are quite a let down. The lobster macaroni was rubbery, halibut was forgettable, potato au gratin doesn&#39;t look appetizing. Fried jumbo shrimp is pretty good. Best thing is the mini crab cakes. Dessert table has good variety we tried the key lime tart and cheese cake. 

Service was disappointing. Our waitress was just going through the motion. We had a bowl on every table for shells/scraps but a busboy took it to empty he but never brought it back. Table was also not cleared when we return from the buffet line. We are not demanding folks. When we go to a buffet, we expect our plates to be cleared and drinks topped up. Simple right? Guess not for this waitress. Several times our waitress looked over at our table, saw the plates, did nothing. She even came over to ask how&#39;s everything and walked away without picking up the empty plates. I mean, really? For dessert, we ask for coffee, which took a while to receive. Then I had to ask and wait for a spoon for my coffee. Just lack common sense. For the price they charge, I expect better service.

Bottom line, 3 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service. I couldn&#39;t justify rounding it up to 3 stars because I won&#39;t be back."

They have some familiar brothy soups with noodles, but in the Korean style. I&#39;m a fan of the Chicken Katsu (Breaded Chicken with a Korean BBQ Sauce) and their Deon Jang (Miso Soup). I typically find myself coming back here for the Gyoza (Pot Stickers). They are very addictive, especially when dipped in the complimentary sauce.

The Bibimbap can be hit or miss, but I quite enjoy the Bul Go Ki. You really can&#39;t go wrong when you throw meat into a soup. However, the tempura vegetables and seafood might be next on the list to try. If you&#39;re not exactly sure when to get for yourself then you can look to your right and see a visual menu. I love that they display everything so you can decide what you&#39;re in the mood for.

Some other things that draw me to this place over others is that the woman working there has always been nice and it seems to always be the same man in the back cooking. I also appreciate that my meals never cost more than about $10-12 and I always leave full. But I definitely think the best aspect is that they are in a food court where I can choose to eat here and my friends have other choices, or I can order an entree at Mama, a Bubble Tea at Jockey Express or a Green Tea Ice Cream at ReLeaf and round off the experience with a trip through the bakery or grocery store.

Today&#39;s argument involved a 7:30 dinner reservation at a nearby restaurant, a visit to Pastry House Hippo (Mitsuwa&#39;s bakery) where we purchased 6 different stuffed buns (all in fun cartoon shapes and colors) and then I walked my MaMa House and saw that their always delicious display case (that never changes) had some new business in there -the case that always contain just one single veggie option, now has 5 veggie options... but you have to specifically ask for the veggie broth, otherwise you&#39;ll be gettin&#39; slipped the beef. 

So the argument started where I was super hungry from not eating anything that day and I couldn&#39;t get the miso off my mind. It was T-minus 2.5 hours until dinner time and after a 6.5 mile hike earlier in the day, I was getting majorly moody. So I bring up the possibility of getting that miso bowl and the boo is all like, &#39;Why? We&#39;re eating soon. That&#39;s ridiculous. Just eat another dessert bun. I&#39;m mean. Blah&#39;... or something to that effect. This was AFTER we&#39;d gotten and eaten 3 of the 6 giant dessert buns that we&#39;d eaten from Pastry House Hippo. And I&#39;m all like, &#39;You just ate three buns. I don&#39;t want any more sweet stuff. Why can&#39;t I have soup? I&#39;m staaarving. You&#39;re mean. You&#39;re rude. I&#39;m about to get real crabby up in here. You do not even know what&#39;s about to hit you. I feel rage.&#39; But then I came up with a compromise. He can eat a fourth bun since he loves them so much and I get to order my soup... and just like that, we were in harmony again. 

Admittedly, I was thinking $7.99 was a lot for soup, but they make it up on the spot (it takes about 10-15 minutes) and you get a bowl of rice and a side or daikon radish and pickles. It&#39;s a meal, for sure. I watched as my soup cooked in a cast-iron bowl over the fire, and when I got it, it was still bowling with a fury not unlike the sun&#39;s. 

The have a bunch of spices up at the counter that you can use, and I would recommend using because the soup isn&#39;t very spicy, and doesn&#39;t have a ton of flavor. It wasn&#39;t anything like traditional miso besides that it has tofu (albeit theirs is the soft, silky kind) and it had mushrooms. 

I like how how warmed me up (needed after our long, brisk hike) and how filling it was. That $7.99 bowl was enough for the two of us with leftovers -- and the leftovers tasted even better than the initial first bite.

I will totally be back (need to try their Bibimbop), but next time I&#39;ll bring my own chili paste or something to liven it up a bit."

The lines for all the Japanese restaurants inside of Mitsuwa Supermarket were 10-20 deep so decided to give Mama&#39;s a try.  I LOVE Korean food and whenever I get a chance Deon Jang Soup (Korean Miso Soup) is tops on my list.  

Mama-san at the register was extremely friendly and polite.  She smiled while taking my order and handed my change back with the ever so respectful one hand to the elbow of the extended arm.   Took a peek in the kitchen (glass wall) and noticed a Mexican chef... oh... interesting.  But I guess the items on the menu weren&#39;t that difficult to make.

About 15 minutes later my Deon Jang Chigae was done!  Thoughts of having this great soup in LA&#39;s Korea Town, South Korea (lived there for 4 yrs), Honolulu and even in Tokyo brought back visions of can&#39;t go wrong yum yum yum oishii~!

Picked it up and as I was placing the food on my table I smelt a very overbearing stanky fart smell.  I mean I like stinky food as some can be unusually addictive but this was seriously like the chef infused extra farts in my soup... it just STANK!  I felt so so so bad for my sister and 2 nephews sitting at my table.  After a few minutes I just couldn&#39;t take it any more... and didn&#39;t want to have my wonderful breathe smell like poo... Honest to goodness... it really really smelled like fresh cow manure.  Had a few spoons of soup and did my best to eat the tofu but I just gave up... 

And the RICE... it was god aweful.  I think it was glue grade rice.

Overall the Mama&#39;s service was so super excellent but food was simply gross.  I highly suggest avoiding this place at all cost and lining up for anything else in the food court.  If you are the one to like the smell and taste of juicy farts then hey... Deon Jang Chigae is for you!"

I&#39;ll enjoy basically anything if you put a sunny side up egg on it, and boy do they know how to sunny side up an egg!
My only complaint is that I had to add soy sauce to my Dol Sot. It ends up tasting like fried rice once you mix it all together and let the stone bowl do its magic, but for me it was bland and was begging me for salt. After adding a generous amount of soy sauce and sriracha, it was heavenly.
Its a little expensive, but who am I kidding? I&#39;ll be back with soy sauce at the ready!"

It&#39;s hard to explain what&#39;s in the dish. The plate is covered in spicy red sauce. For less than $9.00, it includes rice and a side of kimchi.

The food court is a cash only busines and only Ma Ma House offers Take-Out."

Ordered a bi bim bap (without the clay pot), and it was just ok, somewhat bland, even with the (not) hot sauce.  I&#39;d call it Korean fast food, but obviously more delicious and healthy than McDs.

I will disclose that this may be a somewhat unfair review, since it is food court fare, after all, and we&#39;re comparing it to what we eat in Seoul and California, and it may be more constructive to compare it to the other food court members which we&#39;ll try later.

i am just kidding, i may be korean but that doesnt qualify me to judge the place immdiately bad or good.

however, i must say, after i finally tried their bibimbap - this place is not good compare to surrounding korean restaurants. - because you cant really mess up bibimbap but this place kinda did.
if you end up in mitsuwa food court, i&#39;d recommend their ramen place or katsu place rather than this mediocore place.

if you are craving korean, there are many options available within a mile or two from mitsuwa.

not recommended."

They have all of the dishes displayed in the window, as many other restaurants do in the food court. Now, usually when I go to Mitsuwa I eat at Santouka, but last time my friend pestered me to try Mama House with her. I ordered #17, tteok mandu guk, or rice cake and dumpling soup, and my friend ordered bibimbap. My soup was delicious, the rice cakes were cooked well and not stuck together (which is amazing to me, I can NEVER get mine separate!) and the mandu filling was flavorful. I tried a bite of the bibimbap which was also good, nothing special but good. 
I&#39;ll definitely come back to try another dish some time soon; after all, a place must be pretty good if it can draw me away from Santouka."

It&#39;s a staple of establishments that are both Korean through and through, as well as ones that are loosely associated with Korean.  In fact, spotting bi-bim-bap, along with bul-go-gi, in a restaurant&#39;s menu board is a sure sign that the place is owned by Korean.  Why is this?  It&#39;s because each of the dishes is relatively easy to put together using common ingredients you will find in any Korean kitchen.

Given this little background, the bi-bim-bap they serve at Mama House is an abomination -- it&#39;s the worst bi-bim-bap I&#39;ve had in any place.  Ever.  There is no discernable effort that has gone into putting this ridiculous dish together.  None of the topings are made properly.  What&#39;s infuriating is that none of the topings that go onto a bi-bim-bap require more effort than a quik sautee-and-season job -- and this is typically done by the prep chefs in a batch even before the kitchen opens -- yet what you get here is incredibly bad.  It seems as if nothing is seasoned, the topings are embarrassingly paltry, and the use of poor quality and cheap ingredients is blatantly obvious.  

I also tried their neng-myun and bul-go-gi... and they join the rank of the aforementioned abomination in ensuring that Mama House is the worst place to get Korean food in Chicago.

I catch lunch at Mitsuwa a couple of times a month, usually in a group with other Koreans.  Almost every Korean tries this place at least once, but most never eat here again -- and when they do (&#39;there must be at least one thing that&#39;s gotta be okay&#34;), they always come to rue their decision."

When you go to a Japanese grocery store, ORDER JAPANESE FOOD.
But my little phannie was craving bi-bim-bap, so I skipped over and happily ordered, thinking &#34;You can&#39;t go wrong with BBB!&#34;

But you can go wrong...MaMa house was so wrong.
I&#39;ve never had such bland bi-bim-bap. The shittake mushrooms in the dish had a strange flavor that ruined and overpowered all the other ingredients. The beef was bland - could barely taste the usually flavorful marinade. 
The miso soup was really fishy - couldn&#39;t take more than a few sips.

All in all, I&#39;d rather spend more $$ and get a nice bowl of ramen at Santouka. 

Service was fine...you order, they say ok, give you a smile and your number.

The lady will occasionally offer is different dishes similar to the Bimimbap, like the (I forget the name), similar to Bibimbap in the hot stone bowl. While it was also very good, I prefer the cold Bimimbap.

Last night, they had a special Bibimbap with Kimchee! My wife and I shared the large bowl, since we were planning on a late dinner - later.

I would recommend anybody try this place more than once to sample a few things; friend of mine had the half chicken and it looked juicy... place was clean and had friendly service. There were some nice flat screens with sports playing as well...

The food is just as good as it was almost 20 years ago. What was different was, at some point, they updated and remodeled the interior/exterior of the store. Looks very nice.

Very clean dining room. Utensil and Soda Machine counters were clean. 

My food was very good. Finally... a gyro that is flavorful and juicy. When I say juicy I mean that the gyro meat is not over cooked. Very good on the meat and pita. Sauce was good but a bit heavy on the garlic in my opinion. 

Only thing I would have liked to see, and this remains an issue in several of my reviews, is the use of bigger soufflé cups for ketchup pumps. It is a pain to fill up the little ones as they do not hold enough ketchup for the amount of fries you get. It is a pain to have to wait while people in front of you fill up 5-6 cups. Then you get your turn and have to figure out how you are going to carry all that ketchup along with napkins, fork/knife, salt packets and your drink. 

Great to see a place that has made it this long. Awesome to see that they even made improvements to the decor and building instead of standing pat and just collecting money."

They have the BEST gyros in the general Palatine/Arl Hts/Rolling Meadows/Schaumburg area! Takes me about 15 min to drive there using 53, but it&#39;s worth the drive. They always give very GENEROUS portions (esp if you order the gyros plate), and I always end up asking for more tzatziki sauce cuz 1 little container is never enough! 

Highly recommended!"

Unfortunately, that has changed. The last few times we have gone in there we have noticed some big changes. Let&#39;s start with the restaurants appearance. The bathroom is now always dirty. The ceiling in the main dining room has water marks all over it and was Dripping onto the floor when we walked in. Most of the tables are cleaned right away however they are always sticky and most of the time so is the floor. Now let&#39;s move on to the food. One of our favorite foods where the burgers. The burger is always good and is normally cooked the way you like it however they throw it together in such a way that it makes it impossible to keep everything on your sandwich. It&#39;s almost as if they threw it from across the room and hoped it landed in the basket. The condiments for your sandwich are another thing. Several times now we have had Brown liquidy lettuce on our hamburger. It is disgusting. We have ttaken our food to go and it was completely wrong. When we called to see if we can get it corrected we were talked to as if we were children or if we were lying. The main woman is not nice to deal with unless you catch her on a good day which is far and few in between. Also several of the items that we have purchased have been undercooked. basically the chicken was still cluckin and the beef was still mooing. It is sad to say that my family and my friends will no longer be going to this restaurant. I hope it can turn itself back around but from what we&#39;ve seen I think we are done."

As far as value though - terrific. The sandwich was about 5.95 and it was stuffed with meat, onions, and taziki sauce.

I grabbed takeout, but the restaurant itself seems pretty good if you were going to grab lunch or dinner.

It is a small restaurant - nothing fancy here. They do not come around and serve you - you order at the front and pick a seat. I couldn&#39;t believe how busy they were.

Love their gyros hands down MORE than we enjoyed Chiggy&#39;s. Our favorite thing about Kosta&#39;s gyros were that they were not only ample, but they were definitely less GREASY feeling than gyros we had at other places.  I was able to eat it without that gross, overstuffed feeling at the end of the sandwich.  The inside was also pleasantly clean and sunny, so the ambiance definitely won over Chiggy&#39;s, which was not always the best ambiance.   We did order the mushrooms on the side, but they order was a bit disappointingly small and they were a-ok....We&#39;ll stick to just the gyros next time, which definitely won us over!"

Actually, it very well may have been the first place I ever had a gyros.  My mother treated my first gyro as a right of passage... no joke, she made a HUGE deal about it.  Just another reason why I love my momma.

Anyway, last week we were out shopping and hungry, and I suggested Kosta&#39;s.  We stopped in, apparently right at the exact right time because there was NO line, but by the time we were seated and waiting for our number to be called the line was almost out the door.  We ordered simply, 2 gyros, 2 fries, 2 waters, extra tzatziki.

Our number was called quickly, but the food was hot and ready to go.  They really load up their sandwiches here, so unless you&#39;re really super hungry, there&#39;s no need to order the gyros platter (double the meat).  You will leave with a full and happy tummy every time.

The restaurant itself, for a quick service (order at the counter, pick a seat, they&#39;ll call you when it&#39;s ready) is clean and inviting.  They do have a &#34;bus boy&#34; (he&#39;s probably about 80 and owns the place for all I know!) who comes by to pick up unused trays and baskets, or to wipe down the tables.  So much nicer than walking into a dump with food and garbage all over the tables.

I&#39;m definitely a fan, I&#39;ll definitely be back, especially when I&#39;m jonesin&#39; for some gyros.  As a matter of fact, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve never even tried anything else on the menu.  Hey, if it ain&#39;t broke..."

Ordered the platter with fries and a drink - about $11 with tax. Fairly good! What I liked was that the bread it came on was really fresh and lightly heated without too much oil. The place was also really clean for an establishment that has been there for awhile - kudos to Kostas on that.

Quantity for a gyros plate was average - seen better, seen worse. As for the meat itself, it was slightly dry. I&#39;d prefer it this way vs greasy, but the best is somewhere in the middle. 

Overall as far as gyros in this neck of the woods goes, it&#39;s kind of a toss-up between them and Dengeos about 4 miles east down Dundee."

This is a must if you enjoy great Greek style food. 
As for the restaurant itself: there is lots of room to sit, and it&#39;s pretty clean. they have a big flat screen for background noise which usually has the news on. 
The menu is HUGE. There is something  for everyone. Everything from chicken, to burgers, to deserts and milkshakes. The price of their food is fair, as is the portion. 
The only complaint my husband has once was that the polish sausage was very fatty to the point it over took the flavor or the sausage. But he also had a pizza puff that he enjoy immensely! 
Kostas is a must go if your I&#39;m the area and hungry! (Ps: they have coupons they send out in the mail if you live near by!)

A little on the pricey side but they know they pretty much hold the market in the area for gyros since all the other places are sub-par. 

Our gyros meat was a little on the crispy side also known as cooked too long. They are decently generous with the meat so I guess that counteracts the overcooked meat. Kinda.

The order of fries that comes with the gyros plate is ridiculously small. It&#39;s funny to see such a tiny order of fries next to a mountain of gyros meat. Disappointing after dishing out so much for a gyros.

As some said, the food can sometimes be a bit pricey, but so long as the day&#39;s business has been steady (to keep it juicy), the gyros is top notch.  Lately, they have added new varieties, particularly the &#34;Southwest&#34; version of Gyros and Chicken on a Pita that are especially good. The same guys have worked here &#34;forever&#34; and they know what they are doing, and they do it fast and well.  An inside secret: go to their web site for really good coupons on Gyros or Chicken and the cost goes from &#34;OK&#34; to a &#34;great deal&#34; - but be careful, they have removed them as of late April 2013 because of perceived &#34;counterfeiting&#34;!."

I had the gyro.  I will forever be jaded on gyros by Yorkys, in Elmhurst.  I hate mentioning other places in reviews, as places should be reviewed on their own.  But really we do always compare to other places, and Yorky&#39;s in Elmhurst has the BEST gyro I&#39;ve ever had, by far.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t work in Elmhurst anymore, so I&#39;m on the hunt for a new favorite, and I doubt I&#39;ll ever come close to finding a comparable.
The pita was doughy.  they meat was too greasy and just not very flavorful.  I did like that they put the onions on top, so I could redistribute to my needs.
Sadly, the cheese fries did not survive takeout back to the office for lunch.  They were a big blob of mush.  I didn&#39;t know the cheese was going to be added on for me, and not as a side.
I don&#39;t know, I might try them again, as they do look like they have a great menu.  However, it was a bit out of the way for me to go for work lunch, so I doubt I&#39;ll be a frequenter.  
My hunt for the perfect gyro continues."

I came here on a the Sunday before Christmas.  We were driving by and the BF saying &#34;I&#39;m hungry, lets go there.&#34; So to Kostas we went.  The remodel is awesome and the menu is easy to read.  I ordered to steak sandwich and he got a Gyro and a quart of chili.  The sandwich was what I remembered.  A lot of lettuce and tomato on it with an excessive amount of grilled onions.  My only complaint was that I ordered it medium and it was well done. It was a little dry and tough.  His gyro was great.  He described it as one of the best he ever had.  The chili we took with us and he loved it but he did say it was pretty spicy but that didn&#39;t stop us from ordering it again. (The second batch didn&#39;t have as much kick)  I can&#39;t speak for the chili since the moment I heard spicy, I refused to eat it.
I miss this place and the food is still as good as I remember it.  Its a little in the pricey side.  Our lunch was 30 bucks but we enjoyed it and that&#39;s what counts in my book."

Its made with fresh veggies, and an excellent southwest sauce, with fresh grilled chicken. Always tasty. 

If you order your food to go, sometimes they forget a sandwich, or sometimes you get something extra. I think this does have to do with how busy they are, but everyone is human. The older lady at the cash register is always really nice about it and makes sure you get your correct item.

This is not for the &#34;Gluten Free Folks&#34; or the &#34;Whole Foods Crowd,&#34; but I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Kosta&#39;s provides all of the Chicago staples from hot dogs to italian beef. Top it off with some of your favorite fried foods and some solid greek food.

Kosta&#39;s always has a steady flow of traffic and that is a credit to the meals they dish out. Situated on the corner of Dundee and Hicks it resides in front of a Jewel Osco. It looks like a hole in the wall and tastes like heaven.

I love their beef sandwiches and the breaded mushrooms, but I&#39;ve never had anything I don&#39;t like. The only reason I don&#39;t give it 5 stars is because I am sure the ambiance will throw off some people. If you get past that though you should enjoy one of Palatine&#39;s hottest spots."

When I lived outside of the Chicagoland area and returned on vacations, I always made a special trip to Kosta&#39;s.

My favorite food, by far, is the gyros. They get it right! The bread is soft, the meat is seasoned, the onions add a kick, and the cucumber sauce adds a cool touch. It truly is a definitive Chicago gyro.

Their burgers are great. Big, beefy, and full of great toppings.

My girlfriend loves the chicken: well seasoned and very juicy. The skin is crisp and very tasty. I pick at her plate when she&#39;s not paying attention or finish off whatever she can&#39;t!

The only reason I couldn&#39;t give Kosta&#39;s five stars is because we&#39;ve occasionally had a dry chicken or a sloppy burger. I&#39;m not sure why such a great place puts up the occasional dry chicken. When they&#39;re hoppin&#39; (as they often are), the presentation of their food sometimes suffers.

Regardless, I find it offensive that another reviewer called Kosta&#39;s &#34;suburban mediocrity,&#34; adding that &#34;this place wouldn&#39;t last a month in Chicago or North Shore.&#34;

I couldn&#39;t disagree more; this place would make an absolute killing in Chicago! I&#39;m convinced this specific reviewer is some kind of &#34;city elitist&#34; whose reviews are directly proportional to the zip code.

I&#39;m thankful it&#39;s in the suburbs where it&#39;s easier to get to than the wannabe-Kosta&#39;s restaurants you&#39;ll find in Chicago.

My wife and I went here for lunch. We started off with deep-fried wontons, which were filled with chicken, pork and shrimp. I really liked these; the surfaces were browned, bubbly, and blistered, while the meats inside stayed moist. Each was super crispy and exactly what I look for in fried wontons.

For the main dish, I picked Malaysian Char Kuay Teow Mee and my wife got udon noodles. Both of these were very well seasoned, with spices you can practically feel on your tongue. The noodles themselves may have been a hair on the greasy side, but let&#39;s be honest: you&#39;re stir-frying noodles, it&#39;s gonna happen.

More importantly, they nailed the thick and yellow noodles in my Char Kuay Teow. It was a bit spicy, and the shrimp and vegetables played well together on the plate. I&#39;d get it again, no hesitation. My wife&#39;s udon was also well composed, but with a bit more soy and sweetness from an ingredient I don&#39;t know.

I also grabbed a Vietnamese Iced Coffee that was strongly brewed, sweet and creamy; just what I was looking for, and served in a to-go cup for the ride.

2) a lot of asians eat here, so it must be good
3) Prompt, quick, and friendly service and waitstaff
4) The proteins are tiny, and the carbs are a-plenty

So far, I had the shrimp and wonton soup and the shrimp &amp; vegetables. Both dishes had the following things in common with me: decent-sized portion, super cheap, and came quick and fast (yes, I said it) out of the kitchen. The flavor of the shrimp and wonton soup was decent; not too Ramen-packet-eque flavor, but  also needed some hot sauce. The amount of wontons was less than I would like, I counted about 4, in a big-sized bowl. The rest was a handful of egg noodles, some veggies, and a lot of broth.

 The shrimp &amp; vegetables was similar; 4-5 shrimps, rest was rice (about 1.5 cups) and plenty of gravy and canned asian mixed-veggies.

Overall, decent food, but if you&#39;re me and likes their meat, this place might not be your go-to. But if you&#39;re looking for super cheap priced, and a place where you get your food super-quick, this place is for you."

Now this isn&#39;t like one of the cheap take out place with the 3rd rate quality food. The food here is pretty amazing. The prices are like a take out place though (and that&#39;s a good thing!)

I got the curry chicken and fish balls. The chicken had some good spices and flavor going for it. The fish balls were delicious as well. It had this smooth texture inside which felt nice against the tongue.. smoooooth.

Was disappointed with the pineapple banana smoothie though. It was... how do I put it.... &#34;Pineapple flavored water&#34;. Seriously, so much crushed ice and hardly any real fruit in it. Don&#39;t waste your $2.75 on this. 
Go buy a 24 water bottle pack for $2.99 instead!

I don&#39;t understand a lot of these reviews here saying &#34;Place feels cheap... service is bad.. yada yada&#34;). Cmon you get quite a bit of actual &#34;good chinese food&#34; for $5. You can&#39;t expect a Maggiano&#39;s or Yu&#39;s Mandarin ambiance for that price!

Overall, a good experience and will be back again for sure. ($5.50 entree and delicious? Count me in)"

So many say this is true Malay food. Ok, then I would not know. To me it&#39;s sup par (for the most part) across the board for the items I had. I&#39;ll go over a few items...

Spring rolls... Ok can&#39;t really screw this up and they didn&#39;t. +1 for them.

Pork egg rolls are ok. A lot of wrapper around them, the filler is ok. Average.

The duck noodle soup... The duck was good (+1) the noodles were fine, and the broth was lacking. Now maybe this is normal for Malaysian broths as in  watery in flavor? I&#39;ve had broth like this a few times at different spots... I needed to add whatever I could find on the table to make it have some flavor. 

BBQ Pork braised noodles... What does braised mean? I got a pile of wet noodles with some sauce and pork on top. BBQ Pork +1, noodles blah.

The side of shrimp wonton soup was actually good because of the shrimp wontons, again not the broth. 

The lemongrass wings... Extra crunchy with some lemon flavor...dry... 

From the photos you&#39;d think this is a gem and has awesome food. Because I have only been here once I will say it&#39;s cheap and had below average food. There service is like what I&#39;d expect at a hole in the wall in Malaysia. This s not a rip. Think of some generic places in chinatown and that&#39;s what you get here. 

Maybe I need to order other things but when no single dish was good to me why would I want to go back? And people rave on some of the things I had?! I think it gets overrated because it&#39;s super cheap. So if you love cheap then things will taste good to you here..."

This is definitely not an upscale restaurant, which is more than fine. But there is a difference between being not &#34;upscale&#34; and run down. The chairs are all torn up, the menus are full of stains and rips, the tables were greasy...it wasn&#39;t what I would call clean.

The menu looks great, there is a lot to choose from and it is SUPER cheap. I ordered the pho, which I have had before at other places. There was barely any beef, the whole dish tasted like plastic, and the sides were lacking (I had one slice of jalapeno, once slice of lime, a  few sprouts, and basil with holes/dark spots on it). The portion was huge for what you pay, but it really didn&#39;t taste good.

The service was ok overall. They did not give us chopsticks, only forks until we asked for chopsticks. The food did come out quickly. Water was refilled once. We didn&#39;t really have one waiter, a bunch of people came by. 

Needless to say I wasn&#39;t impressed. I have experienced better. I would rather pay more and go to another place."

The food served is ample and the quality is well worth every penny. Service is very fast during busy hour around noon. 

I ordered the chicken curry, the spiciness is well balanced served with rice. The udon is a little bland and need a little more salt. We also ordered the fried egg rolls, and it&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. The crab rangoon is perfectly done. Both appetizers are way better than what you would get from a Chinese buffet.

The room is somewhat unfinished and cramp with the entrance door situated like a 7/11 store. But don&#39;t be fooled on the first impression as the food is well worth the low price. Overall the experience was good with above average quality food that won&#39;t burn a hole through your wallet."

Once I got home I got to give everything a try. This is the first place that I&#39;ve tried in this area that has an egg roll I actually like! Crispy, full of meat and veggies. I also had crab rangoon, which were also exceptional. I&#39;m a rice person, so I ordered chicken fried rice. It was really good, a little crispy that you can tell it was made in a wok the proper way. The barbeque pork udon I didn&#39;t get to, but I&#39;m guessing by the way the boyfriend scarfed them down, that it was delicious as well. 
I definitely will be ordering from here again. I&#39;m craving another egg roll as I type this!"

I had an order of the Mapo tofu and a Vietnamese iced coffee while my friends had the BBQ pork fried rice and curry fried rice.  For the price you definitely get good bang for your buck.  

I recommend the Mapo tofu which is diced tofu with ground meat (either pork or beef) in a spicy chili and bean sauce.  If you can&#39;t tolerate heat like me, you have your choice of mild or spicy.  The fried rice dishes were good as well and I liked the curry one better.  As for the Vietnamese coffee, I would pass on that.

Large portions (American style), unbeatable prices (Asian style), flavorful dishes, and speedy service define this place. With a super casual ambience, Asian Noodle House is perfect for everyone. It&#39;s difficult picking a favorite dish because everything I&#39;ve tried so far is Sedap! (delicious), and probably whatever I try next will become bae. 

The pho selection is great. The broth has flavor, not too salty like other places, and not to bland or water-ey either. Pick any, and you&#39;ll forget about winter... Until you go outside again. The Ma Pho Tofu in all its ground beef, tofu, chili bean sauce glory, served over rice reminded me of Ampang, Malaysia. So did the Char Kuey Teow, a Malay stir fried noodle dish which makes you forget about your lesser carbs New Years resolution. You can get both dishes in mild, medium and spicy. The Spicy tomato chicken rice plate is kinda underrated but If you love sweet and spicy like me, this is for you. It has some onion which gives the dish a nice crunch and covers my vegetable intake for the day. The beef &amp; broccoli is pretty much standard. 

There is also a secret Menu with a couple of Malaysian dishes, so don&#39;t forget to check those out. It&#39;s a Malaysian operated business and they&#39;re very nice."

After checking Yelp reviews, I thought this could be a great find.

The menu is varied with many different types of Asian noodles and it was very hard to decide which to try on my first visit. I looked around and saw people enjoying a range of dishes, but I&#39;ve been having a taste for chow fun noodles and I choose the chow fun with chicken and broccoli.

I was quite disappointed.

The noodles themselves were rubbery, some extremely overcooked, and others fair, but not as good as some other restaurants, and not nearly as good as my visits to Hong Kong, China, and Malaysia.

The gravy was thick, floury, and relatively tasteless. Not much hint of Chinese flavors or spices.

The broccoli was the high point. That was fresh and flavorful.

The mushrooms seemed like they had just come out of the can.  I am not sure, but their uniform size and shape and their lack of freshness seemed to indicate canned vegetable.  Don&#39;t hold me to that, though.  I was not sure. But I was not impressed.

The chicken was ok. Very small pieces of chopped chicken, enough in quantity, but not enough in flavor.

Prices were very reasonable, service was good, and the ambiance reminded me of small family owned restaurants in Chinatown in NYC.  But the menu choice I made this time didn&#39;t result in any excitement.

So, overall, I was very disappointed because I thought this was going to be an immediate winner.  Instead, I will have to give it another try when I am back in this area."

No where else in the northwest burbs could you find a place like this.  I bet if you had a taste for something like say...salty fish with chicken fried rice (honestly, where could you find that in the burbs and done well?) you could find it here! I bet the chef enjoys a challenge.  So if you want something that isn&#39;t on menu, try asking for it?!  

We get totally carried away trying their entire menu.   Its good and a safe place to get adventurous.  The dining room is not particularly large, and there is a constant flow of pick up orders.  The restaurant is usually packed with regulars and Asian families. 

If you&#39;re in for an adventure, just let the server know that you just want to be happy at the end of the meal.   We did just that and we were very satisfied, several off-menu items popped onto our table (since I&#39;m Chinese and not from Malaysia it was familiar but not really).

The meat in the soup was soft and not too tough, but their tendons were a bit too overlooked for me. I like my tendon a bit chewier.. This texture tasted more like soft jello or something. All in all, enjoyed my meal. 

Their udon noodles (dry) are pretty good here too from what I remember. 

We ordered a mango smoothie too... Definitely not fresh fruit (had the artificial mango flavor), but still quenched the thirst and was a good combination with the spicy soup. Nothing in comparison to like joy yees or anything.. Normal chinese buffet type of smoothie.

Hainanese chicken rice, the rice is full of preservative flavour (msg), and the chicken serving was very small! The table next to us had almost double our size of chicken!

It is only for people who can appreciate good South East Asian foods at cheap price with no frills. I have been going here for years and I enjoy their foods and not having to pay an arm and a leg for it. Plus, it&#39;s very very fast!

I have recommended this place to my bosses who love this type of cuisine, and these formal corporate big whigs would take off their suit jackets and loosen their ties to slurp on some awesome pho or wonton noodle soup. Some other friends didn&#39;t even want to come here or they had wrong expectation about the place. Yeah, it can be misunderstood pretty easily. 

However, it has been a favorite amongst my friends and me as you can get pretty amazing food you can&#39;t get anywhere. The owners are Malaysians so they cater to some Malaysian cuisine menu items and some aren&#39;t even on the menu. You have to know it to order it.

I come here for those items as those are close to Indonesian foods I love. I order nasi lemak quite often which is rice cooked with ginger and coconut milk served with chicken or lamb curry, sambal or a spicy chili concoction, cucumber, and shrimp cracker. I also love their char kway teow, which is a traditional Wok fried Malaysian flat rice noodles. They mixed egg noodles and flat rice noodles as their trademark so it&#39;s a bit different. I have gotten so used to it that I forgot the difference. All I taste each time is nom nom nom.

I have ordered many things and all are good. Here are some more favorites of mine: Yung Chow Fried Rice, Salted Fish Fried Rice with fried egg, Mapo Tofu rice dish, Bak Kut Teh, Lemon Grass Wings, Fried Egg Rolls, Shrimp and egg omelette rice dish, Pho, and Wonton Noodle Soup.

I ordered char kway teow yesterday and I asked for shrimp and beef on the noodle. I was told it would be extra. I said okay. I also ordered a small wonton soup. My total check was $11. Unreal!!

I think they are doing a fantastic job with this restaurant. They are probably not the best restaurant in the world and not the fanciest. However at that price, and for the uniqueness of the food, I am a fan for life."

We arrived around 645PM to a pretty packed house - I was surprised given it&#39;s out in the suburbs and was a Sunday night no less.  We had about a 30 minute wait, where the front of the house seemed a little scatterbrained in terms of turning tables - there were a few tables that opened up for quite a while with no one being seated at them.  When we were finally seated, service was quite fast.

We ordered an appetizer of crab rangoon to start with - a great deal at like $3 something for 6 pieces.  The wonton wrapper was good, although the filling was pretty scanty.  But at three bucks, I couldn&#39;t complain.

I ordered a wonton noodle soup with shrimp wontons and BBQ pork with extra noodles.  My friends ordered beef pho and one of the udon noodle dishes.  All of our entrees were less than $6 - which is kind of insane.  All the food was quite tasty - although I normally expect a bit more of a bite to my wonton noodles, overall it was a good meal.  One tip - I think my friend expected her udon noodles to come in a broth - they were sauted in a rich brown sauce and mixed with veggies and beef.  I believe all their udon dishes are sauted versus being served in a soup broth.

When we got the check, we each paid $10 which included tax and a more than 20% tip.  Insanely cheap.  Next time I&#39;m in the area and craving some soupy noodles - I would definitely consider coming back for some good, cheap eats."

It was good and cost $5 a bowl. The pho was pretty good I liked the broth flavor. I think next time we eat there I&#39;d like to try their stir-fry udon noodles.

I am not rating service, quality, etc.  In other words I am not holding a fine sit-down expectation.  I hate it when people do that.

I&#39;ve been coming here for years.  The pho is why i first came, and although it&#39;s good pho... it&#39;s not the best authentic pho i&#39;ve had.  But it&#39;s $5 a bowl... tough to beat.  Beef udon is good.  Great suggestions for people who are uneasy about trying new asian food.  The chicken wings are a great value... I think it&#39;s like $4 for 3 or 4 whole wings (so 6-8 reg wings).  Another favorite is their Malaysian Noodle.  it&#39;s a stir fried noodle with a few shrimp. scallions, egg, and  pork? Sorry, it&#39;s been awhile since i&#39;ve last had it.  Either way.... delicious.

Eat there and go for the good food."

I visited for the does time with an experienced ANH patron. She knew exactly what she wanted while I had been reviewing the photos on Yelp aka Help the night before. I chose a black pepper noodle dish and tried a drink with tapioca pearls. 

Here are my thoughts...

It was downright cold inside on a winter evening. But the hot tea warmed me up!

Tapioca pearls are not for the close minded. I tried them. They were weird. And awesome!  I think I liked them, but I seemed to be getting full from my drink. 

Udon noodles are really good and black pepper can be spicy. 

So what if it looks a little divey...it was a very reasonable dinner with great company and tasty food. And I will go back!"

The service is fast and abrupt at times, but they&#39;re trying to feed people fast, so you can&#39;t take it personally.

I went for the beef balls and well-done beef pho. She got her stand by of chicken friend rice, and we split spring rolls. I also got a diet coke ... our bill was $15. That&#39;s insane.

The spring roll was great - a small bite containing lots of flavor and crunchy vegetables topped with a very thick peanut sauce. Nom number one.

Next up was the pho. The broth wasn&#39;t anything to write home about, but the beef balls were mighty flavorful and generous in portions. The noodles were also tasty. Nom number two.

My sister&#39;s fried rice took the cake. It was salty, savory and full of different textures. The chicken was tender, the rice was just the right amount of sticky and the vegetables still had bite.  Nom number three.

I&#39;ll be back, but I might have to engage in some kind of suburban parking warfare to get there. That lot is no joke on the weekends."

Pad thai, not so much. It was more bland than anything else. Really no flavor. 
My husband did not enjoy his food either. 

It didn&#39;t make us sick but we certainly did not care for it either.

With a concise menu offering a strong array of cuisine, it&#39;d be easy to say that just about anything you&#39;d order would be potentially good. Because across three separate visits thus far, that&#39;s proven consistently to be the case.

The fried egg rolls and wontons are must-try appetizers with their crunchy exteriors, satisfyingly meaty interiors and all the better complimented by the sweet Thai chili sauce that comes on the side.

For a main course, you can&#39;t go wrong with the combination Udon, a cornucopia of flavor that first seeded my love for this place. But the Malaysian Noodles solidified that love into outright fandom being, hands down one of the best Asian dishes I&#39;ve had to date.

As a slight aside, the Curry Chicken with rice is a solid offering. But the surplus of bones in the chicken may be enough to turn some off to the dish. Don&#39;t let this be the case, it&#39;s
worth trying!

If in doubt, put a fried egg on it. Makes any dish all the more serious business.

The atmosphere isn&#39;t much to write home about, but you should be focusing on the food, and getting it into your face, anyway. And with the price of admission being insanely good, my only regret is that with the amount of disappointing alternative offerings  in Schaumburg, my wife and I didn&#39;t find this place sooner."

A whole, gut-busting meal with drinks and appetizers for about $10!? HELLS YEAH!

Asian Noodle House is an awesome and reliable place with yummy food and excellent prices. I&#39;ve been here for a solo dinner once and a few lunches with coworkers. All experiences were good with quick service and great meals, regardless of the crowd.

They&#39;ve got plenty of meat options for my friends and veggie options for me. My go-to dish here is a large serving of vegetable fried rice and some kind of bubble tea. My favorite one so far is the Hawaiian flavored bubble tea. Mmmmmyumm! I&#39;ve tried the braised noodles but didn&#39;t really like them. The tofu wonton soup is surprisingly good, though. I&#39;ve got my eye on the udon noodles for next time -- I need to break away from my &#39;safe&#39; meals.

The only thing I don&#39;t like about this place is the tea served in plastic cups. The tea is fine but the cups are not. Plastic cup tea isn&#39;t appealing. But then again, this place isn&#39;t striving for class. It&#39;s very bare bones with vinyl cafeteria chairs and dirty-but-not-really-dirty basic tables topped with sticky condiments. For some reason, that gives this place some character. That&#39;s why I love it.

Asian Noodle House is a little place in a strip mall. I have to say my first impression by appearance was not so positive. That being said the food on a scale of 1 - 10 is a 10. I was so impressed that It has become one of my favorite places in Chicago.

The food is fresh and high quality. The service is fast and friendly. The prices are crazy low for the quantity of food you get. It is a hole in the wall that has some of the best Asian food I have ever had in my life. Everyone I have ever brought there has fallen in love with Asian Noodle House.

I will start off by saying that while today wasn&#39;t my first time dining on Asian Noodle House fare, it was the first time sitting down in the restaurant, and it made me never want to sit down here again.

The last time I got food from ANH, I phoned in my order &amp; picked it up.  The wait time was super fast, especially for lunchtime rush &amp; the food was great.  I even got a few bao to go when I saw that they had them for sale, freshly made.  My coworkers had raved about this place, and I could see why.  The pepper udon with beef was super peppery but not overbearing, and I couldn&#39;t wait to give it another try.

One of my coworkers decided to treat me to lunch, and ANH was the first place that came to mind.  I figured lunchtime would be busy, but those are the breaks when you go to a place that has such good food.  As expected, when we got there, there was a line.  No problem.  The problem came when the waiter seated another group who came in after us before we were seated.  Fine, whatever, it was hectic, and maybe he didn&#39;t notice that we were there first.  But he made eye contact with us, acknowledging our existence at least.  Another party came in &amp; he approached them in order to seat them, totally ignoring us.  Being hungry and pregnant, I spoke up and said &#34;excuse me, we were next &amp; there are two of us,&#34; which must of caught him off guard judging from the look that he gave me.  He then told us that we could go sit at the table in the corner &amp; pointed, no apology, nothing.  I have to say that this has unfortunately left an awful taste in my mouth, putting a damper on the celebratory nature of lunch for us.

Another waiter quickly took our order &amp; our food was out in no time.  The peppered chicken (see what I did there...yup, I like to mix things up a bit) was every bit as good as I remembered, and the avocado smoothie was perfection.  My dining companion also enjoyed her meal &amp; banana smoothie.  I can&#39;t say that I will never dine here again because that would be a lie, but I think it&#39;s safe to assert that I will never go to ANH again during the noon hour for a sit-down meal."

Curried chicken fried rice is savory and unique.  The Wonton soup is excellent without the overdose of MSG you sometimes get with this dish.  Barbecued pork over rice and spicy shrimp and tomato over rice are also very good, though the latter is a little lacking in the shrimp.

Chinese greens are a bit fibrous.

The spring rolls are just so so.  Pho is average (better at Viet House down the street)."

First visit there this morning, my daughter ordered a chicken noodle meal and the spring rolls. Both were excellent! I ordered curry chicken with rice. Bones and fatty dark meat all over the place so I told the server I didn&#39;t want it (didn&#39;t even take a full bite out of it) and that I would like what my daughter had. I was told he would charge me for the new dish and when the bill came he actually charged me for the curry chicken even though I didn&#39;t have any of it.

Where is the customer service? Where is the desire for customers to return? Who would return after such an awful FIRST experience? Is it worth losing a customer for $5???"

It&#39;s a divey kind of place in a strip mall next to a Valli&#39;s produce store so of course the parking lot is CRAZY during the weekends!  If you can come during the week, then it&#39;s the best time..slower pace.  You don&#39;t feel rushed.  The worst time is Sunday lunch, unless you like the hussle and bussle of the crowd and you don&#39;t mind waiting for 30 mins for a table even one that it&#39;s close to the front door.  If you see a lot of Asians coming here, then that is also a plus!  When you see a line of people out the door waiting to be seated, then you know the food is good here! 

It&#39;s as close as you can get when it comes to good Pho soup, like going to one of the Pho places in Argyle in the city but it&#39;s in the burbs plus they have a private parking lot!

I&#39;ve tried other dishes and they were pretty good, but again I&#39;m here for the flavorful 
Pho Noodle Soup and I like putting in all the sides that comes with the soup.  Like fresh bean sprouts, Thai Basil leaves, fresh squeeze lime juice, plus on the table Cock Sauce (Sriracha hot chili sauce) and a good squeeze of Hoisin Sauce to top it off.  I like a bit spicy so a little squirt of Sriracha is good enough for me, however hubby wants more so the top of his head would sweat and a runny nose sniff, sniff so good on a cold winter day!

I also like their avocado and green tea smoothies with tapioca, yum!

The staff is quick with your food but don&#39;t expect a casual hi my name is Bob and I&#39;ll be serving you today, it&#39;s more like...you want #17 pho soup with extra beef balls and noodles, ok, ok...next!

What I don&#39;t care much is their tables and chair.  They need to upgrade those but maybe they like the divey kind of feel?  Also they serve hot tea that taste like rice tea in plastic cups.  They refill it for you, so don&#39;t expect to get those silver tea pots at your table.

Overall, I come here more during the cold season but there will be a couple of time that I will come here when I&#39;m in the mood for noodle soup."

How can a meal of this quality be less than 6 dollars? I guess it&#39;s a little more with tax and tip but you have to personally go and see how much food you get for the low, low price.

I&#39;m not going to lie, it&#39;s not the best Asian food you&#39;ll ever eat, but it&#39;s definitely worth the money. I got to try the curry chicken fried rice and although it doesn&#39;t have as curry flavor as I&#39;d like, you can always ask them for a little more curry sauce to spice up the dish.

If you&#39;re low on cash, high on hunger, in the west suburbs, and craving something from the far east, this place will definitely hit the spot."
asian-noodle-house-hoffman-estates,Candice G.,UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg,"Silicon Valley, CA",1,1,1,4707,1,aWP0RrMmIuUdzWfJypmPJw,4.0,2013-01-21,"This Lunar New Year, my resolution is to put the &#39;Fat&#39; in &#39;Gung Hay Fat Choy&#39;.

Mission accomplished and a big thank you goes out to Asian Noodle House for giving me the confidence and means to make my 2013 dreams come true.

First off, to the fancy people over the world: Lower your ambiance expectations. Even saying &#39;casual&#39; is an overstatement. The place is bare-bones basic with mismatched, teetering tables and the cheapest diner chairs, most of which appear to have survived a knife fight of some sort and are actively bleeding foam from their rips and tears. It&#39;s not dirty, but it&#39;s not a hyper clean place either. I&#39;d definitely think twice before eating something I dropped on the bare table, which is not normally the case and all the table condiments are pretty sticky. So just be prepared for that and know that it&#39;s all up hill from there. 

The service is there... not overly friendly but they were helpful, though incredibly rushed, when we&#39;d asked questions regarding which dishes could be made without any meat, of which the general answer was that anything that wasn&#39;t soup, can be done sans meat, though I don&#39;t know that it&#39;&#39;s the absolute truth that you&#39;re dish will actually have been cooked meat-free. The food comes up fast and they do tend to get very busy during lunch times or peak weekend hours. 

The food and drink here are the real stars... that and the ridiculous, borderline-third-world-country pricing. Seriously. My braised noodles with tofu rang in at $3.25 and a giant, almost literal bucket-o-black pepper udon noodles with tofu was $5.25. Insane in the membrane. And I have to ashamedly admit that I was half expecting greasy, tummy-ache inducing Chinese food, and while the food was undeniably sodium-rich, the flavors were hearty, rich and our dishes, regardless of the almost bestial portion we ate, didn&#39;t cause any gut-busting or upset intestinal tracts. 

Also, the boba here was freakin&#39; outstanding... though they were out of my first flavor choice of plum. The Watermelon with Lychee and tapioca bubbles was beyond the bee&#39;s knees. 

Our bill for two people who ate an absolutely grotesque amount of food consisting of two appetizers (spring rolls and egg rolls), braised noodles with tofu, black pepper udon noodles with tofu, one bubble tea, two bottomless hot teas and two complimentary fortune cookies with tax was only $20 and some change. You can&#39;t beat that and can&#39;t keep me away."

Called ahead to secure a table for 7 at 7pm on a Sunday night...they close at 8, and this was PLENTY of time to eat and enjoy our time because the FOOD CAME OUT SO FAST! Showed up with a bunch of beer and wine, they were prompt with the empty cups and water glasses. We ordered apps right away, spring rolls (great), crab rangoon (could&#39;ve used more filling but VERY flavorful), and chicken wings (perfect fried texture and inner moisture...even better with a combo of sriracha and chili oil smothered on top). 

The entrees were hit or miss. I was really excited about the black pepper udon with beef...but this was probably the most mediocre dish of the night. Way too much pepper, but I also have never gotten this dish anywhere else so I might be ignorant to how the dish is traditionally prepared. If excessive pepper is how it is supposed to come (and I don&#39;t mean this sarcastically), then this dish was perfect for that preparation. My sister got the combo egg noodle dish that was probably the best dish of the night (lucky bastard) with a side of bbq duck which was equally amazing. My brother got the pho that seemed to be solid. My Dad got the bbq pork noodle soup that he said was okay, the broth was not very flavorful (more watery than anything) and the egg noodles had been boiled way past al dente. My Mom got the braised noodle dish which was superb! Comparable to a combo of pad see-ew with Mongolian beef...which is a very delicious combo at that!

Overall, service was prompt and extremely knowledgeable, environment was exactly what you&#39;d be looking for in a casual night out in the burbs, food was borderline great IF you know what to order, and for the money, you absolutely cannot beat the portion sizes. With 7 people, after tax and tip, the whole meal came out to about $100...and we ordered WAY too much food. Could&#39;ve been content with half that amount.

Will definitely go back to try the other things on the menu!"

We came at an after-lunch time which, from what I&#39;ve heard, may have been a good idea.  The word on the street is that this place gets packed, but we were seated immediately and served quickly.  We were brought hot tea seconds after sitting down.  The waiter was read to take our order as soon as we closed our menus without making us feel pressured.

The SO and I started with the lemon grass wings.  Warning for the squeamish - these weren&#39;t your typical &#34;brazillian&#34; flashed wings... they did have a few minor feather hairs in them but nothing that bothered me.  They were very large, very juicy, and well seasoned.

For our main meals we ordered a chow fun sea food combo and the super bowl (of soup - not sure if I missed the play on words).  The chow fun was just a little tank-y in smell, but not anything that would push me away and less so than what I&#39;ve experienced in chinatown.  The color was good and everything tasted fresh.  The texture on it was great and the noodles were prepared well - not too overcooked like some places offer.  The super bowl had beef, fish balls, and dumplings in a ramen like broth.  All were delicious, and the bowl was pho sized. Plenty for a second (or third) meal on both plates.

When we were done things were boxed up and out the door with high efficiency and no bother.  There wasn&#39;t any language barrier, so no worries there.

I&#39;ll be back!"

In my teenage/high school years, this was a great place to dine because of the inexpensive menu (most dishes are around $5-7) and their extremely cheap bubble tea smoothies.

The dishes that O usually get are the &#34;Malaysian chow-Kuh-tao-mi&#34; which is a noodle platter with a the meat you want and a lot of flavor.

I also enjoy the combination fried rice (which includes scallops, shrimp, and a whole lot of fried rice)

Lastly, the pho is decent too, however the broth is very heavy and tastes overall, more thick and sodium filled when compared to other places that make pho.  

Now that I am in my mid-twenties, I no longer dine here more than once every few months or so because the food is kind of heavy, not the best quality, and the place is kind of dirty. I have never gone there in my past ten years of life where the tables weren&#39;t sticky... 

Overall, the waiting staff is ok (not particularly bad and not particularly rude).  If you&#39;re looking for a quick, cheap meal, this is a solid choice.  If you&#39;re willing to spend $10-12 on your meal, go elsewhere in the area (house of pho, viet house, yu&#39;s mandarin, or China house)."

With that being said, my current review is completely unbiased as after tasting the food here, it didn&#39;t touch on other similar joints.

I ordered fish chips (they use turbot rather than cod like most places do), clam strips, zucchini fries, and catfish.  It was all cooked rather quickly and came with my choice of tartar sauce, as well as regular or hot cocktail sauce. 

Took the food home, and was a bit turned off by the flavor of their tartar sauce.  It was extremely tart and almost curdled as if it had gone a little off the wayside. 

The fish chips (wth is a turbot, anyways?) had this weird sweet taste to them that I wasn&#39;t fond of.  Also the fish chips themselves were quite small and really not &#39;meaty&#39;. 

The clam strips and the zucchini fries tasted EXACTLY the same, except that the zucchini fries seemed to have some italian dried herbs on them. 

All in all, this place was extremely subpar.  I just can&#39;t think of anything that stood out about it.  Looks like I&#39;ll still be taking a drive closer to the city whenever I have a fried fish hankering. Sigh."

I ordered the $8.99 shrimp dinner and was disappointed at every item. The coleslaw came in a container about as big as the cocktail sauce container, the fries were average, and there were maybe 8 of the smallest pieces of shrimp that one could find -- and they were burnt.

This wouldn&#39;t be the first time that other Elites have led me astray.

We entered into a run down looking storefront with an old lady busy reading a book at the front counter. We asked what was popular and chose shrimp, fries, and other side items. She then proceeded to the rear to prepare our order. You can look through to the kitchen and see a TV and other items that don&#39;t necessarily belong in a kitchen and it looked rather disheveled. I figured I would just ignore that as long as the food tasted good.

Then I saw her reach in to a freezer and pull out our frozen meal then dump them in to oil. My heart sank and I knew that this place wasn&#39;t the gem I was looking for. I kept an open mind and took our meal home and tried it out. Much to my disappointment, all the food tasted like each other as well as other items on their menu. It must have been ages since the oil was changed and I can understand why. The lack of customers and presence of only one employee shouts the general disapproval of its past patrons.

Well, last night, I found out that you can, but the even better part is that they have great, cooked to order food to take home and eat. 

To share between four of us, we ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of fish chips, fries, onion rings and mozzarella sticks. We had tartar sauce, homemade cocktail sauce and homemade SPICY cocktail sauce. The spicy was my favorite and a real treat! It didn&#39;t burn, but there was a slight bite to it that kept me wanting more. It was just the right amount of food (maybe a tiny bit too much) and it was all cooked just right. The woman who served us weighed out everything before she cooked it, washed her hands in between handling the cash register/money and our food, she was informative and extra-pleasant. 

It&#39;s not a fancy place by any means. It&#39;s a simple concept with extraordinary carry-out. We might just have to head back again this weekend!"

They are a bit pricey ($13.50/ib of shrimp) but the shrimp are nice and clean and the batter is very tasty. They also have homemade cocktail sauce. They&#39;re also extremely quick: about 3-5 minutes to fry up some seafood for ya.

Other things on the menu: catfish, scallops, perch, calamari, spicy curly fries, chicken tenders,  etc. You can also get dinners which include slaw, fries, and cocktail sauce.

I really wanna go back for the catfish, hopefully Foster&#39;s is good a pickin out them there bones!"

This place is a cash register with a fry-o-later. They&#39;re known for their shrimp and seafood. While a sign on the wall says they do offer fresh shrimp at market price, the emphasis is clearly on the fried goods. 

My wife and I split a pound of fried shrimp and some other fried side items. It was pretty good, but a little on the expensive given that it&#39;s just fried-food takeout. It&#39;s better than going to LJS to get fried seafood, but don&#39;t expect to get any delicately prepared seafood at Fosters. It&#39;s fried goodness start to finish. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, then definitely drop in. I&#39;ll be back when I get the hankering. 

A couple of interesting notes: no tables/seating, credit card is $15 minimum, but that&#39;s not hard to hit when 1lb of shrimp runs $13."

I&#39;ll usually order, pick it up and eat it in the car in the parking lot because I can&#39;t wait to get home to chow down.

I ordered about $25 worth of food, got shrimp, calamari, fries, cole slaw.  The shrimp and calamari were taken out of freezer from a bag that looked like it came from grocery store frozen section.  So now I&#39;m paying for frozen fish not FRESH fried fish.  And this is what they supposedly specialize in?  Everything is weighed so think you will get any extra fish or hook up on frozen fish!

cilantro-taco-grill-addison-2,Dar J.,hVLPj4rUjbmGnhub2dIltg,"Addison, IL",0,1,0,17,234,OFR_RpizrYu7zOqYGvwjQg,5.0,2016-08-06,"This is a long post, but there are many, many reasons why we LOVE THIS PLACE! We eat a lot of Mexican in my house because the food is typically very easy to customize to accommodate the dietary restrictions of my wife and mother-in-law (vegetarian and vegan, respectively). When we moved to Addison about a year ago we were super excited to see all the options for Mexican food. Cilantro was the second place we tried and it became our go-to place. We probably got this place a dozen more times before trying checking out any other restaurants, since then we&#39;ve basically tried them all but Cilantro is still our favorite. 

I order the steak burrito at pretty much every Mexican place. Cilantro&#39;s steak is delicious, it&#39;s tender, juicy (not greasy), and has an excellent flavor; I&#39;ve never bitten into any gross gristly pieces. One of my favorite things about the burrito is that once it&#39;s all wrapped up nice and tight it&#39;s grilled giving the tortilla an additional hint of flavor and a little bit of crunch. Lately, I&#39;ve been on a taco kick. Though I prefer the flavor of corn tortillas, I&#39;m really picky about it and usually end up getting flour tortillas. If it&#39;s not done right corn tortillas can be dry and hard and I can&#39;t stand that. I&#39;m pretty sure everyone reading this knows what I mean. Not here, their corn tortillas are perfect every single time, the flavor is amazing and they stay moist (not soggy) and pliable. My favorite tacos are the pastor tacos with cilantro, onion, and cheese on corn tortillas, but the steak, barbacoa, carnitas, and chicken are delicious, too. I have not had any of the other meats, but based on the flavor of the ones I have had, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re equally as delicious. My wife and MIL always get the veggie burrito and they love them. They actually have a station specifically for cooking vegetarian items to help minimize cross contamination. OH! Guacamole is made to order so it&#39;s always fresh! AND, get the guac sauce, it&#39;s hot but it&#39;s awesome. They also have this red salsa that has a smokey layer to it, it&#39;s SO GOOD! This salsa has actually become my favorite salsa of all time. 

The restaurant is always very clean and we love the contemporary design; you will not find any velvet pictures of bull fighters in this place. Every single employee we&#39;ve ever interacted with has been genuinely friendly and polite, and they continue to be as I fire off ever single modification the picky eaters in my house require. I&#39;d also like to add that they have literally NEVER gotten a single modification wrong. NOT ONE. It&#39;s awesome. 

We picked up Cilantro for my mother-in-law&#39;s birthday dinner tonight (her request). We actually have a few friends that always want to get this place when they come visit. Anyway, while standing outside waiting for everything I noticed an employee cleaning out a taco truck. I started talking to him and learned that they do private events! The gentleman gave me a copy of the taquiza menu and explained how it all worked. I was surprised to see how reasonably priced it all was. Included in the price you get your choice of meats, plates, silverware, napkins, salsas, pickled veggies, and chiles asados. They come out to your location, cook all of the food IN THEIR TRUCK, serve the guests, do all of the cleanup, and you get to keep the leftovers! How perfect is that? We are seriously considering just having a party for no reason just to get the taquiza."

They can get the job done of you&#39;re in the mood for Mexican food. Came here for lunch Monday. They had a nice picture of a big burrito on the wall that appeared to be &#34;calling my name.&#34; Additionally, I love comparing burritos at Mexican restaurants since anyone can make a taco but apparently it&#39;s hard to get a good burrito so that&#39;s what I got. My wife kept it simple and got chicken tacos.

Size: big enough to get you full but not big enough to make you uncomfortably STUFFED like my favorite Mexican place by my job. The flavors in the burrito are good; not the best I&#39;ve had but good enough to merit a return if I&#39;m in the taste for Mexican food and don&#39;t feel like traveling far. They have 3 sauces; when I put the green and HOT (greenish yellow) sauces on it, it made the flavors pop a whole lot better.

All in all, if you&#39;re looking for good Mexican food with descent service, you&#39;re in the right spot but if you&#39;re looking for the best in Chicago, this ain&#39;t it."

I have enjoyed all of them. I think the chicken can have more spice personally, but the food is still well done. Burritos are common culprits of being watery and leaky. I don&#39;t have that experience at Cilantro. Food tastes fresh and it&#39;s a great place to phone in and pick up quickly for lunch. It&#39;s nice to be able to order by the taco also, if you just want one or a bunch of tacos.

I enjoy the choice of avocado sauce/salsa in addition to the usual red and green. Decor is updated and clean."

Located right off of Lake St, there is an ample parking lot. There are small tables that can sit 4 and enough room to put the tables together if your coming with a group. Overall it&#39;s pretty clean.

After exploring the menu, The &#34;Burrito Belly&#34; intrigued me. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s similar to Chipotle&#39;s burrito bowl. I ordered it with steak for an affordable $6.95. Everything on it without the tortilla wrapper.

I ordered a taco salad, and I never eat the shell, so it&#39;s all about the inner ingredients for me.  The salad came in a golden fried shell, and inside was a mixture or rice, beans, lettuce, and shredded chicken. On top was shredded cheese, and 2 thin slices of tomato and 2 thin slices of avocado.  The presentation was lovely, and the taste divine.

They had three sauces available and I tried all three.  They were all very good.

So, I dragged a pal along to check it out.

I think we were expecting more of a sit-down establishment versus a &#34;Chipotle&#34; type one - I guess the location in Rosemont is, though.  This locale is still relatively new (about 3 months old) and still smells a little like paint.

There is counter seating and a handful of tables for dining in.  We placed our orders - chips and guacamole and two taco dinners (steak for him, fish for me).  Each was $7.75, but there was a $1 upcharge for my fish.  Our bill was $20 and change.

We weren&#39;t sure when our food was ready - there was no order number, and most of the orders were called out in Spanish.  When each order was ready, it was put out on a section of the counter.  What that meant, though, was that other diners swarmed to the area to see if it was their food (and I&#39;m not a big fan of other patrons breathing over my food - gahhhh!).  We waited until the busy order taker/cashier girl let us know (after it had been sitting there for several minutes) that ours was ready.

I LOVE that they have a separate area for veggie-only preparation so there is no cross-contamination with meat (for veggie-only folks).  There are also veggie-only options that include beans.  My student said that there&#39;s some special light green sauce available, but we didn&#39;t have it, so she thinks it may only be at the Rosemont location.  We enjoyed the green and red hot sauces, though.  The guac was good but needed salt/seasoning.  He enjoyed his steak tacos, and I liked the fish, though I don&#39;t think they were seasoned at all. 

I&#39;d go back in the future, but probably for takeout if it&#39;s at this location; otherwise I&#39;d like to try the Rosemont location."

This place rules. I eat it once every time I&#39;m home. My parents frequent it so often they know the employees. That&#39;s when you know.

I usually get a veggie burrito, which is so massive and loaded with rice, beans, cheese, avocado, tomatoes, and lettuce. Every bite is amazing, especially when smothered in their jalapeno creme sauce, which is basically emulsified jalapenos. If I&#39;m feeling the neeeed for cheeeeese I get the chile relleno, which is unreal and dripping with hot chihuahua cheese. 

My friends and family swear by their taco dinner in either fish or chorizo, and enjoy the huge side of rice and beans on the side.

I moved to Itasca in 2008 from Elmwood Park  and haven&#39;t been able to find authentic Mexican food that I like until Cilantro. You&#39;d think somewhere around here I&#39;d be able to find stellar Mexican cuisine but I tried several places and was extremely disappointed after being used to Mexican food in Melrose Park. Some of you will know exactly what I&#39;m talking about - Melrose is where it&#39;s at. I never noticed this place until last night, we happened to be driving Lake Street to meet up with friends when I saw it. I decided to stop in today after work for pork carnitas and chips with guac. Heaven. I&#39;m picky about ethnic food so I&#39;m very confident when I tell all of you to look no further..This is Mexican nirvana. Good prices too. Enjoy!"

This is my typical mexican restaurant order. The meat was of a high quality and very tasty. The quantity was a bit lacking, I wish the tacos were more full. In general I also like a bit of crumbled cheese on my taco, this was missing. The chips and salsa were good (the chips were not homemade). I would come back here in the future but only if I had some sort of coupon."

I think this place is pretty new, as the restaurant literally has the new drywall and paint smell. The setup is you order your food at the front, and they call out your order and you grab your order and sit down to eat. The dining area is somewhat small. I would guess you can sit maybe 20 people in it.

The prices aren&#39;t too bad. Most tacos are $1.85, with the exception of the more &#34;exotic&#34; meats like lengua and fish. What&#39;s cool about this place is that they totally respect vegetarians as they have a completely separate station to prepare vegetarian plates.

The menu is pretty decent with your taco and burrito staples, along platillos and tortas. I ordered the dinner taco plate, which included 3 tacos, rice and beans. I ordered the steak, which was OK. The meat seasoned OK, although the rice I thought was somewhat bland. Each dine in table had a container of pickled jalapeños, cauliflower, carrots, and onions, which was good. Jennifer P ordered the fish tacos and she said they were OK, but it didn&#39;t sound like she was too impressed. Overall, decent place to get some tacos.


BATHROOM REVIEW -- Place totes one coed bathroom. Inside there&#39;s a toilet, super bright, hand dryer, but no paper towels if you are a germaphobe like me and uses a paper towel to grip the door handle open. Sit or squat? Sit... but I&#39;d be hasty and drop and deuce right away, as there can be a line of people waiting to use the one bathroom in the restaurant."

I haven&#39;t had anything other than their taco dinner the many times I&#39;ve ordered from here, but let me tell you, this place is the bomb. 

This location is generous with the asada, and the beans were yummy. Their tacos come with corn tortillas, cilantro, and chopped onion, and their salsa verde goes really well with this combo. Also, the asada tacos weren&#39;t super greasy, which I appreciate. This place will definitely be my go to when I&#39;m in Addison."

This place is small and located in the strip mall that housed a Dominick&#39;s but is now undergoing some type of mall renovation. The parking lot is a bit treacherous as others pointed out, especially at night so be careful when you go there.
Stopped in here and ordered the taco dinner (Al Pastor) and a steak burrito to take home.
The service was friendly, the place was clean, and they cook your food right in front of you.
On to the food quality: It was very good. Fresh ingredients, fresh tasting. I liked it.
Addison has many taco places. Many. However, I find this a welcome addition to the area and I will be back to try other menu items.
Well done Cilantro Grill.

I recommend calling in first because they do get busy &amp; you will usually have to wait 10min or more for walk ins.

I will say sometimes they can skimp a little on the meat...last night I asked for &#39;extra meat&#39; and they did not disappoint!!  they filled those tortillas!...yes, I paid extra for this, but for $2/taco it was worth it.  I&#39;ll be a regular here.."

Did Addison need another Mexican restaurant? Probably not BUT I love tacos so I am not complaining. 

We stopped here for dinner and I got the steak taco dinner and my husband got a steak burrito. The wait time wasn&#39;t too long but there was only 1 other customer waiting for an order. Food is cooked to order. Store itself is pretty small with only a few tables and a long table against window with bar stools. 

Tables have communal pickled carrots for the taking, salsa is stored in fridges behind counter so will need to ask for those. No complimentary chips and salsa which was disappointing. 

Food was decent and reasonably priced. For our 2 dinners plus water and a drink was around $20 (there are places down the street that will get you the same thing for half the cost). 

Biggest problem is the horrid parking lot. I don&#39;t know who purchased this strip mall and is fixing it up but they need to fix the parking lot. Pot holes everywhere and no markings. People are parking all willy nilly boxing cars in, it is chaos. It felt like we parked in the middle of a street because cars are just speeding by left and right. Someone is going to get hurt or get damage to their car.

My problem is they put the rice in a grocery bag and then heated it up for ten min.  A grocery bag is NOT something that should be used in a microwave.  That is toxic!!  When I went to the girl at the counter and questioned this she explained that this is how they heat the rice when it gets cold.  Again, my problem is not the microwave, they should be using a glass bowl, not a grocery bag."

In Mexico most tacos are served with &#34;cebolla y cilantro&#34; aka onions and cilantro a little bit of salsa to add some kick and you&#39;re all done. The place is a bit small but that&#39;s because it&#39;s only the beginning to this establishment. I&#39;m sure it will get bigger once they see that they have more customers than chairs.

I&#39;ve been to Munchies a few times now and it is perfect for a quick cheap lunch.  Munchies is mainly a pizza place but they also have sandwiches, salads, and more.  Munchies also has a bar that is open during lunch hours.  The restaurant is split into two sections.  On the right is the more sit down and eat your meal side with an old school TV as your entertainment and the other side is the bar area.  You enter right in front of the order counter.

They have a lot of pizza lunch specials obviously.  I have had the pizza here on several occasions and it is pretty good.  The pizza slice with fries and a drink will only cost you $4 and some change.

I order my drink, decide on my to-go lunch order and wait. Usually just a few minutes. The food is packaged up nicely for transport back to my desk. 

I&#39;ve recently learned that their Wednesday special, a chicken and pasta dish, runs out quickly. But if you call ahead, they can reserve some for you. It&#39;s pretty tasty. I really enjoyed the grilled chicken. 

I&#39;ve always been a chicken pastina soup lover!  The pastina is perfect for this delicious concoction. 

Finally, I still find excuses to eat the ranch dressing. It&#39;s garlicky and makes me the outcast for the afternoon, but it&#39;s worth it!"

The pizza still tastes good, but it doesn&#39;t have as much sausage on it as it used to have. The meatball sandwich still tastes good, but the meatballs are not enough to fill the length of the bread anymore. Too bad..."

Great pizza and sandwiches and pasta dishes that would cost a lot more at a trendy Italian restaurant. Family owned and food is prepared with family recipes including homemade ravioli. Most people who frequent Munchies have been doing so for years and Joe and Marie the owners often greet their customers by name. They do a crazy lunch business and move the crowd thru with few problems. I have tried many things on the menu and was never disappointed. By far the best deal is the pizza slice and fries special!

Today (it&#39;s a Wednesday) we went for lunch and the place was packed with people streaming in.   I usually bail at that point at most places but we decided to stick to it.  Service was pretty quick despite the crowd.

The food is good - I haven&#39;t had the Pizza yet but it looks tempting.  I&#39;ve had mostly their beefs and my wife usually has a salad.  Their beef is good - but it&#39;s served super dry by default and you have to ask for the juice.  I guess I&#39;m used to the more Chicago style of a dipped beef.  Still great if you remember to ask for juice (although they have been decent about providing it after the fact.

We were turned off by the place at first because we thought it was a neighborhood bar.  Nothing against a neighborhood bar, just that it doesn&#39;t look so kid friendly.  Having been there a few times, it&#39;s less Bar than it is pizza joint.  The bar is an afterthought there.

Will probably go again with the kids for pizza.  Prices are pretty good."

Best pizza in Elk Grove Village.  Pizza, crust included, tastes excellent.  If the lasagna, doesn&#39;t sell out, very good, as well.  The paper plates are kinda hoky but I get it.  I will say this from a value stand point that I can buy a large, one topping pan pizza for under $20.  The same pizza at Lou Malnatis will go closer to $28 and it&#39;s not as good, at least in the Village area.  

My only complaint is that they need to subscribe to Grub Hub for delivery.  I know people, albeit in the city that can do up to 35% in Grub Hub business. I&#39;m sure it cuts into profits but when it&#39;s cold out, like now, I&#39;m doing delivery and have to pass on my favorite pizza."

Since it&#39;s about 20 minutes from where she lives, I knew this place had to be special.  

Normally, I would go on a restaurant&#39;s website to see what I was going to order beforehand and look at their calories etc. but my grandmother has no computer and I don&#39;t have internet on my phone so I decided not to order anything.  (Hey, I&#39;m part of a Biggest Loser diet right now and need to win my next weigh-in!)

So when we arrived there, it was obvious the owners were Blackhawks fans.  Blackhawks stuff all over the place and even recent stuff from their 2013 win.  My grandmother ordered a large pizza and my kids got a pizza with cheese, pepperoni, and bacon bits.  The place wasn&#39;t busy, but I wouldn&#39;t expect it to be at 3p either.  There are a few tables to sit at so we did that while waiting for our pizzas.  Our pizzas were ready and we took them to-go.  I had to put them in the trunk since there was no room in my small car.  The smell from them was amazing!

So once we got home, my kids ate their pizza for dinner while I had boring tuna fish from a can.  They gobbled it up and wanted more.  The next day, we still had pizza left so I heated some up for them for lunch.  This time the smell got to me and I had to sneak a bite and it was delish.

Some of the places that I heard were good, were NOT, at all. Some were just okay,some were so bad I wound up throwing it away! Well, I tried Pete&#39;s A Pie tonight, and as soon as I took my first bite,I knew I found my new pizza place!! In fact,in between bites I called them to let them know how good it was!

When I first called,the person on the phone was just so nice. Then when I got there,they were just pulling the pizza out of the oven,so they are also right on time. The guy at the counter was so nice and friendly as well.

Once I got it home it was just SO good! The spices,and sauce and ingredients were so flavorful and fresh! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who truly knows and likes pizza!
I cannot wait to go back...and work my way down the menu!  Good job guys!"

 Not only did they screw up our order, the Illiterate lady who runs the place blamed us for her screw up.  To make a long story short, we ordered a baked potato with Pizza topping that she read as Pizza bread. The woman called 2 co-workers over to read the order that was jotted down on the order pad. All of them said that the order sheet said baked potato.  Not only that, she charged my co-worker for the pizza bread. 
 I have worked in the food and beverage industry, and I know that lunch rushes can be tough, but blaming the customer for your screw-up puts you in a category that us in the sane world like to call a nut bag. 
 Too bad for Pete&#39;s.  We have a large office not far from this loony bin that orders out often.  They just cost themselves a shit load of money. 
 So in summary, I would rather eat stale Frito&#39;s off of the bathroom floor before I would even consider going back to this place again."

Pros: The service was AMAZING. Prompt, courteous and professional.

The place is clean, inviting and well apportioned. The bread right as you sit dowm is a nice touch.

Cons:The food was &#34;ok.&#34; I mean, nothing was wrong with it, but it was about the quality you get at a work conference in a 2 star banquet hall. The artichoke dip was nothing special, my NY Strip was really tough and ny Mother-In-Law&#39;s tilapia was fishy. And her brownie was seriously undercooked.

Service was amazing,  but I didnt have anything that would make me want to cone back here."

Reason for 3 stars?  They have a 2 year old policy that states on the menu that they no longer use trans fats.  No butter.  I don&#39;t use margarine at home and certainly don&#39;t care for it dining out.  No more walleye or white fish sauteed in butter.  &#34;Bread and margarine&#34;.
If you are listening Jameson&#39;s, stop giving in to the trend  that everyone is on board with this craze.I resent the whiny tree-huggers dictating my dining choices (unless you are trying to save a few $$$ and are hiding behind the apron of the trans fat scare). What will it be next?  Only decaffeinated coffee?  I always looked forward to dining with you until the menu change.
Now, when given the option, I choose another venue. I also don&#39;t care for the occasional waitstaff who dismissively refer to the patrons as &#34;my dear, dear and hun.&#34; It&#39;s almost as if they resent having to wait on you.

Yesterday my family and I dined in and I will say this restaurant has been one of our go to places for years. The staff is excellent and so is the food. But we got to see what happens behind the scenes last night and I will say we will not be coming back. A younger looking girl from what I heard brought back several food plates saying her table said it was cold and gave it to whom appeared to be the main chef in a white coat. A few minutes later she came back and asked him how long he thought it would be and he told her to shut the f up and not worry about it...I think this poor girl was just as shocked as we were to hear someone speak in such disrespect to a co worker of their own like that. We then saw the girl walk away tearing up and we later approached her saying that wasn&#39;t right at all and she should go to general management. She was very sweet and tried to shrug it off but we saw it bothered her. My family and I could not believe that the managers let their staff talk to each other like that. That is no way for a man to ever talk to a woman and NOT okay. We will not be coming back to jamesons.

Don&#39;t get an appetizer. You get soup,  salad, and bread with your meal right away. 

I got the special which was 6oz. New York strip with 5 fried shrimp and mashed potatoes.

First off, we made a reservation which the male host very rudely accused us of not making until a hostess said she actually did have it listed. We waited an HOUR AND A HALF to get seated. With a reservation. Absolutely ridiculous. I get we had 7 people, but that&#39;s why we made a reservation ahead of time! They gave us calamari and octopus free for the wait, but wish they&#39;d asked because none of us like it. It was a nice gesture but I really think we should&#39;ve gotten a free meal or two for the wait and the rude host. The filet was just ok, twice baked potatoes were great, but altogether for the prices it just wasn&#39;t worth it. The only great thing was that the waitress was fantastic and super sweet.

Food was just &#34;okay&#34;, and our entrees were very overpriced.  From just glancing at the menu, they are VERY pricey.  Ordered a regular burger and fries which was &#34;okay at best&#34; for almost $12 - it was NOT that good, and it was pink and probably medium rare on the inside - though in their defense, I was not asked and did not tell the waitress how I wanted it cooked.  Just across the street at Outback Steakhouse, they have burgers ten times better for about $2 less.  My date ordered a fish n&#39; chips type of entree which was literally $19.99.  We could have gotten something similar at Friday&#39;s nearby on Army Trail Rd. for maybe half that price, and Friday&#39;s isn&#39;t exactly that cheap either.  On my way home, I passed a McDonald&#39;s and I thought to myself that I could have had one of those burgers - which would have tasted better - for about $1.  No joke.

Bread was decent.  Soup was just &#34;okay&#34;.  This came with our entrees though, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have ordered.

Drinks - wayyy overpriced. Even the soda I ordered was in what seemed to be a half-sized glass.  While I am not a drinker, I am fairly versed in some of the going prices for the standard drinks as I regularly am out with people who do drink.  My date ordered two margaritas which came to almost $15.  

Our waitress was decent, but not once did she bring or even ask about our soda refills.

* The salad that came with my date&#39;s dinner had brown spots on the lettuce, I even looked a second time just to be sure and low and behold, there were brown spots.  We got it in a &#34;to go&#34; box, and my date just threw it out while we exited the restaurant.  We weren&#39;t gonna eat that, but it was part of money spent that aggravated me more.

Overall, I probably would not return unless I was given a gift-card or something.  $60 spent for everything when we could have probably spent $20-$25 less at Outback across the street or Friday&#39;s right nearby and had similar or better food and the same drinks.  Also on the way out, the parking lot was jam-packed with cars parking adjacent to the walkway, and these WERE NOT parking spots.

If you want to spend upper-end prices for food and want an almost guarantee on great food and quality, take your business to Wildfire.  If you want a very similar atmosphere and similar food quality and a bit better of a bargain (or if you are taking the kids out per se), stick with Outback, Friday&#39;s, or even Longhorn.

Overrated and we didn&#39;t get the hype this place receives...  I&#39;d give our experience about a C- at best."

All three times there was a wait, and it appears that near dinner time, they get pretty busy. We had to wait about an hour on a Saturday at 6 PM. You can reserve a table on Opentable, so I&#39;d suggest making reservations ahead if you know you will be going there. 

The menu items come with a soup, salad and side, so it&#39;s a pretty good value. 

First off, your server will bring you warm sourdough bread with a yummy whipped sweet cream butter. Also, appetizers if you order any. We tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which I would skip as it was super spinachy (which isn&#39;t a bad thing) and the dip itself was lacking something.. The consistency was a little watery. The calamari on the other hand was great!

Soup will follow, whichever of the couple of choices you have - I&#39;ve tried a few of their soups, and they were all pretty good. 

The salad will come after, which has always been very fresh and green. I especially like upgrading to the greek salad, in which they will add feta and pitted kalamata olives (which are pretty good quality). I also had the caesar, which I have to say that the dressing was really watered down. I was hoping for a thicker, richer dressing.

As far as food, I&#39;ve only had the filet mignon and the beef kabob. Both were good. For a side, you can have a potato or the daily vegetables (the green beans are a no-go). 

The dessert selections are also good. I particularly like the flourless chocolate cake (very rich) and the brownie sundae. I also tried the carrot cake that was just OK, and the cheesecake, which is pretty standard.

My only gripe about this place is how slow the service is. I haven&#39;t had any issues with servers - they were all great, but the length of time you have to wait for your drinks, bread, appetizers, soup, salad, dinner, dessert (for parties obviously).. Everything comes out slowly. Prepare to be there for around 3 hours, as after an hour has passed, you are just getting to your salad. Perhaps thats why there is always a wait? I think they need more staff. 

But overall, I like Jameson&#39;s. I will return."

For sides, I got a cesar salad and twice baked potato.      The quality was top notch!  We each got a martini, and they were delicious; my Bombay Sapphire was perfectly chilled.

Sure restaurants are busy on holidays and there is generally more risk for slower service on such a day. What we experienced yesterday was unreal. 

My fiancé and I were trying to do something nice for our Mothers on the year we are getting married so we decided to book a family lunch on Mother&#39;s day to have our families bond a little. We have some dietary concerns and my fiancé called to inquire about the limited menu. She received the answer &#34;It&#39;s pretty much everything on the regular menu with a few things less.&#34;  This was not the case, there was a very limited menu with only the expensive items displayed (chops and seafood mostly). There was a section called &#34;Burgers and Salads&#34; and my brother made the joke it should say &#34;Burger and Salad&#34; because there was a whopping one option for each. When I asked at the front desk if they were for real or could we order something off the regular menu they were very unapologetic and basically said &#34;No, we can&#39;t (help you) because it&#39;s a holiday.&#34;

This was to be the theme for the entire day. We couldn&#39;t order a turkey sandwich or rueben because it was a holiday. They didn&#39;t have a caesar salad as an option with the entree because it was a holiday. We barely got any service for refills on our drinks without waving the wait staff down and asking, why, because it was a holiday? They didn&#39;t ask a few of us how we would like our burgers cooked and they just decided we wanted medium. To get them to split the check, which they first refused because it was a holiday, we had to track down a manager and he personally messed it up for us. Then we had to track down the wait staff to get the rest of our bill and it took them a while to get it to us so we could pay and leave and be done with the place. 

While going to Jameson&#39;s is normally a decent experience I would strongly urge everyone to avoid it on a holiday. That was some of the worst service I&#39;ve experienced in my eating career.

The front desk staff was unhelpful and unapologetic. 

The wait staff was unfriendly and complained about management when we asked for normal things like splitting the check.

The wait staff was not very attentive to details like drink refills or what food should go where. They came by with another tables food, ready to give it to us. Luckily for them it was wrong.

The management had to be tracked down and begged to split the damn check.... and then to get the other half of it back.

The food was good, kudos to the chefs, they made me give 2 stars instead of 1.


TL;DR -- Good food, but the service seems to go to hell on a holiday. Avoid at all cost on those special days, they are sorely not prepared to handle them."

Several not horrible but not good experiences here. For whatever reason, they have a hard time keeping drinks filled. A table of 8 should not have all empty glasses for 20 minutes. 

Food is bland. Soup is plain, no flavor. Veggies are just steamed, no seasoning, no nothing. Steak needs A1 to be flavorful, and that is if they even manage to cook it right."

We were seated immediately and our waitress was great!  She promptly took our drink orders and was back in no time for our appetizer order.  This review is in no way a reflection of our waitress.  She couldn&#39;t have been nicer and she was very attentive.  My problem was with the order.  My friend ordered a filet, which she said was good.  I ordered the bone in rib-eye.  My rib-eye was tiny.  (I seem to recall going there a few years ago and their bone-in rib-eye was the &#34;tomahawk chop&#34; style and huge.  This definitely was not.)  Not only that, once I started to cut into it, I realized that it was mostly gristle and fat.  Plus, the broccoli that seemed to be the standard on everyone&#39;s plate is not necessary.  It was dry and old...not really edible.  The waitress had the manager come over and while he did remove it from the bill, he made the comment that sometimes you get a fatty one.  Um, for $36 dollars, the steak should be perfect.  The only other complaint I have is that they bring the food out a bit too fast for me.  We were only half way through our appetizer when the soup came out.  Half way through that, the salads arrived....it kind of went that way for the whole meal.

This is due to the bad attitude of the two male hosts in the front and quite honestly mediocre food. I didn&#39;t expect this place to be a Ruth&#39;s Chris or higher end level of food and service but still, someone references this place is better than Outback which I disagree.

We ordered our food and within a few minutes received our soup, the server picked up our dishes very shortly after we finished... A few minutes later.. Salad! Our main course also arrived in a timely manner. (Granted, none of this was RUSHED).

I thought or server was great (considering she was trying working with all 8 of us, PLUS other tables). Her name was Jaime. She was really sweet, and pretty attentive. She tried to be personable, but it was really busy, so I know it&#39;s hard to connect with a table when you have a lot of running around to do.

I have never been here before, and I had pretty decent expectations for the place. I ordered the 8 oz sirloin with roasted red potatoes and veggies. Ordered it medium. The steak was cooked to perfection. Juicy, tender, flavorful. I&#39;m honestly not sure if I got the red potatoes(I think they were just regular small golden potatoes).The veggies were green beans with cooked carrots -very good.

My own personal experience was great! But a few of my family members ordered ribs and they were disappointed, and -to me- they looked like they didn&#39;t have much meat on them. BUT it&#39;s a steak house... Not a specialty bbq joint.. 

*Side note: It seems like every time I go out somewhere and am not pleased with my food, everybody else&#39;s is perfectly fine. But when I go out and everybody else&#39;s food is unsatisfying mine is quite good.

... Anybody else have that happen to them?"

Make a reservation for NYE. We didn&#39;t and arrived just before 5pm. The lobby was packed. We sat at the bar and ate dinner there. It wasn&#39;t overly comfortable, but that&#39;s what last minute decision makers get. 

There was a split decision on the shrimp dejongh appetizer. I liked it. He didn&#39;t. The filet was worth every penny. So tender. It was well seasoned and just right. The one stem of broccoli hardly constitutes a side of veggies and shouldn&#39;t even be mentioned on the menu. The salad was meh. Some of the lettuce was wilty with brown edges. I picked through that and nibbled on what was palatable. The mashed potatoes should be served on a separate dish. The steak juices were all over the plate and thus all throughout the mashed potatoes. Maybe it&#39;s me, but if my foods are going to be mixed, I want to be the one to do it. Finally the chocolate peanut butter pie was heavenly, but the cost was outrageous!  It was not a slice. It was a sliver.  So reduce the price or increase the size of the piece. I felt like I got the short end of the stick on that one. 

Overall, the service was okay. It&#39;s still obvious that the regulars get preferential treatment around here. Even at the bar when you can clearly see that you aren&#39;t being acknowledged. There are some real highlights, but the lowlights keep me from going here too often."

It&#39;s never been great - just a bit above your average restaurant (think Friday&#39;s). However, this last time was awful. It seems like each time it has just gotten worse and worse.

Service has always been slow. A lot of young high school kids and/or college aged kids. Yes, portions are decent for the price...but that&#39;s about where it ends.

The food is sub-par. This latest time several of us got hamburgers. I got a salad and coleslaw with mine. My coleslaw was awful. Very sour. Some of the pieces of lettuce were eight inches long. They couldn&#39;t even cut them up. Now the hamburger--terrible. Driest burger i&#39;ve ever had. It couldn&#39;t have been all meat. Didn&#39;t even taste like hamburger. I asked for it medium, but they cooked it &#34;extra well.&#34; So this just added to the terrible taste.

We also tried the chicken wings as an appetizer. Would not recommend. The ones you can get from a freezer bag taste just as good. We figured these items would be easy to make, but I guess we thought wrong. Maybe they had a bad night...but we won&#39;t be back.

Anyways, all of us got sick from the burgers. Not throwing up sick, but on the toilet all night sick. When we called the next day, the manager wasn&#39;t even apologetic. He said he could refund the money if we used a credit card, but since we paid in cash, he said he wouldn&#39;t be able to do a refund - only a gift card. After arguing and explaining we wouldn&#39;t be visiting ever again, he agreed to refund the burgers via a cash refund.

Not sure what all the fuss is about with this place. It is not worth a visit. Do yourself a favor and take a look at the filtered yelp reviews. Some how, all of the &#34;bad&#34; reviews got removed from the Jameson&#39;s page and have been filtered. There are better restaurants within a short distance of Bloomingdale.

Edit: why is my review filtered? Do I need to post a picture of my receipt? Yelp is such a scam."

The salad was not spectacular and the dressing was super oily (italian). The entree was really good, the mashed potatoes and Parmesan crusted filet was awesome.

Decent steaks, fish, and chicken. You get soup and salad with an entree, nice.  The Chicken and the chopped steak are the best deals and taste good as well. Otherwise, you&#39;re pushing close to $30 for steak or fish. Drinks are priced a little on the high side. Nice bar though. 

A veggie comes with your meal too, here&#39;s where they lose a star, broccoli, is the &#34;only&#34; veggie. You can not even buy anything else. Now, I like broccoli, so I&#39;m predisposed to enjoy their broccoli. It&#39;s truly awful here. You&#39;d think if you only did one veggie you&#39;d be the master of it. Not the case here. It&#39;s a lifeless mass that tastes like its spent the last 2 hours sitting in hot water. It looks like the stuff you wouldn&#39;t buy at the grocery store. Is it the executive chef, the manager, or the corporate weenies (this place is a chain) responsible for this?

She has celiacs and I don&#39;t expect every restaurant to fully understand it but they should have some insight and abilities to cook food without gluten in them. you figure steak and potatoes and roasted veggies. How could it have gluten in it? right... wrong. So on with the experience. We come here to eat, we let the waitress know she has celiacs.  Waitress has heard of it but no clue what it really means. She was attentative to it but she thinks its more of a dairy allergen, so we go on to explain it more. She still seems confused by it. While ordering apps she would keep saying that has dairy in it or but this has garlic in it. She goes and talks to her manager about it more. when we order our entrees my wife is told very few sides can be made gluten free.  She settles for the rice, which is naturally gluten free. when we get our food, she doesnt have rice she has a baked potatoe. she tells the waitress she ordered the rice. the waitress replies it has gluten in it, we could not give it to you. My wife at this point very upset tells her how rediculous that is. The manager then steps in, asks us how are food is. when we tell him what happened his response completely blows me out of the water. See, jamesons doesnt use basic salt pepper and spices. They have bases for all of their food. and any restaurant telling you they are gluten free is lying or unknowingly giving customers gluten. Also his idea of making the situation better was to boil my wife a potatoe... I dont understand why couldnt have just boiled her the rice like every other place. We have eaten out at many places and never has my wife gotten sick and almost every time the restaurant is very accommadating. Now, I am an ok cook and I have been cooking for my wife for 6yrs gluten free for her. If i could make it happen, I think a steak house cooks should be capable of it as well. and the whole fact that the cooks dont do anything other than mix food with bases actually scares me a bit. Seem kind of like Jamesons is more of a glorified fast food chain than steak house. Also, my steak wasnt very good and niether was the side. I actually emailed them to give and recieve feedback, I never got a response. and i dont think things have changed because a friend of mine who also has celiacs didnt have as bad of an experience but wasnt as good as he had hoped either. I think we will stick to real steak houses that use spices rather than bases for their food."

What a lot of decent food for a very reasonable price. For $10, I had a bacon cheeseburger that came with fries, pickles, coleslaw, AND a generous bowl of very tasty tomato barley soup. The bacon was crisp, I really liked the buttery bun, and the burger was a winner all around. Everyone in our large party enjoyed their meal, including two who ended up with large, filling salads. 

The restaurant itself is nice, with comfy chairs and ambient lighting. We had to ask that the (gas) fireplace be turned down, since those of us seated near it felt quickly roasted.

Our server seemed a bit inattentive given that the restaurant was nearly empty when we visited. She took everyone&#39;s drink order but mine (presumably because I was feeding my baby and she didn&#39;t know I could do two things at once), forgot to sub a baked potato for fries for one kid, forgot a drink refill...nothing terrible, just not impressive.

After dinner we went to the bar for drinks and unfortunately that&#39;s why I had to give this place only one star.  The bartender was absolutely rude, arrogant, and ill mannered.  As the designated driver I only ordered water but the others were ordering drinks and the bar at this time of the evening was only half full.  I asked many times for refill of water without getting a response.  I had to take my husband&#39;s water because HE was able to get some maybe because he was ordering drinks??
When my friend asked for a water after a couple, he actually rolled his eyes!  Clearly is not a seasoned bartender because he is clueless on how to treat customers, especially the ones picking up the bill.  When I finally waved him down to get the bill, he took my card, left the receipt in front of me and never said a word.
In all the years of leaving a tipping for service I have NEVER not tipped a server, even if service was slow.  This was the first time I left a server nothing.  Then when we were getting our coats on, he shouted &#34;thanks for the tip&#34;.  My reply was, &#34;it is an exact reflection of the service you provided here at this bar&#34;.  Maybe he should consider another line of work?!
We will return to the restaurant because we enjoyed our meal so much, but we will never return to that bar.  The management should really get more in tune with their servers at the bar, because clearly there have been many customers who have had similar experiences."

Our server (Nicole) doesn&#39;t belong in the food industry or any business requiring her to come in contact with customers. From the moment she arrived at our table my husband and I recognized her bad attitude. She was unbelievably cold and unfriendly. 

I observed other servers all evening long who went out of their way to be friendly.  I also observed that every other table received crackers with their soup but we did not.  Every other table who had leftovers were given a box and a bag.  We only got a box.  Petty complaints, I know, but here is my biggest gripe...all of our dinners were cold.    

My filet and my husbands cheeseburger were cold.  My baked potato was the warmest thing on my plate and the butter had a hard time melting in it.  The french fries and veggies were ice cold. 

Clearly our food sat for a long time before Nicole found time to pick it up.  It&#39;s not like she was overloaded, from what I could tell she only had three tables to take care of.   Dirty appetizer plates, utensils and empty bread tray remained on our table all evening.

I&#39;ve come here like once or twice a year when I&#39;m in the mood for a steak and it never really disappoints or impresses me. This place is as average and generic as it gets for a steak house. My last trip I had the:

Filet Peppercorn: ($22.00) : Their Saturday special. 2 small 4oz filets coated in peppercorn and topped with a creamy peppercorn sauce. Honestly this dish was good but not that great. It comes with mashed potatoes which were kind of over salted and some broccoli. (See Picture)

Soup (Complimentary): I had the chicken tortellini soup. It was actually quite good, the tortellini had a tasty cheese mix inside it. 

Salad (Complimentary) : standard caesar salad, not bad, not great. 

Bread (Complimentary): The bread here is above average. I think its some sort of ciabatta and it tastes very fresh and comes to your table warm. 

Considering the price: I would say it makes sense that every meal comes with soup, salad, and bread. The ambiance to this place is nice and the service is pretty fast and attentive. I would say if you&#39;re one of those people afraid to try new foods, this should be your safe house. Steaks, chops, pasta, chicken...etc everything you expect from a standard steakhouse that tastes exactly like you imagine everything would taste.

Normally we go to Wildfire for special occasions but on a friend&#39;s recommendation we decided to give Jameson&#39;s a try. The steaks were delicious and perfectly cooked. I would consider this a higher caliber place. I would definitely place it above Outback and the steaks were in par with Wildfire. I was shocked that the meals were not a la carte. You receive more than one course (soup and salad and choice of potato and a vegetable) and the spacing between courses was perfectly timed. We will definitely return!

The service is always good and so is the food; a little on the pricey side in my opinion, but the portions are of decent size. 

Last time we went, I ordered their salmon special, which came with vegetables and an additional side (I chose the twice baked potato). The salmon was pretty good and was a very large fillet, not necessarily something I couldn&#39;t have prepared myself, but still pretty good. It also came with soup (I chose the chicken noodle) that had a delicious broth but was lacking in the chicken department. 

Overall, a nice place to go from time to time, but it won&#39;t knock your socks off."

Good food at a reasonable price.  You can&#39;t beat the $22 12 oz. Prime Sirloin.  All entrees come with warm bread, soup, salad, a potato side and a veggie.  You get a lot of bang for your buck here.  I haven&#39;t found a steak place in the Western suburbs that I enjoy more for the price.  

As for the service, it is average to good.  We have never had any issues, but this is the type of restaurant where they expect you to take a little bit longer to get through the meal.  I prefer it that way as I don&#39;t want to rush through each course.  The atmosphere is not stuffy and is more approachable for families with kids.

This will continue to be our go-to steak place as there is nothing we&#39;ve found that compares for the value."

The food was above average, and prices are very reasonable for the level and amount of food you get.  I would say the quality of food is above that of your Outback, Friday&#39;s, Lone Star, Fridays, etc, but not quite the level of your top end steak houses.  In my opinion they sit in the perfect place of somewhere that you can go to semi-regularly and not feel like you are breaking the bank.  It is a perfect Date-night, Celebration, break from the norm destination.  On my visit I got the 28oz bone in Ribeye, and it was delicious, you get both soup and salad with your entree and a choice of potato with a side vegetable.  I chose the mashed potatoes and was treated to a generous mound of potato goodness with my meal.  My date got a Steak and Shrimp combo which I was told was also delicious.  I definitely would recommend the Bone in Ribeye though if you are a steak person, definitely worth the little extra money!  I highly recommend this place and cannot wait to return again."

We asked for another larger table and the manager was happy to accommodate. 

Overall the prices were  reasonable and the food was fair. Large portions but honestly the food was not fabulous enough  to make me want to come back again immediately. I wouldn&#39;t avoid it but won&#39;t be a favorite. 

We ordered the prime rib, bone-in rib eyed steak, the macadamia crusted tilapia and chicken with artichoke. Nobody complained about the meat and some complimented their dish. The twice baked potato was a bit dry and nothing special. The rice pilaf tasted like something from Rice A Roni but with real rice. The chicken tortellini soups was soggy so much so that the orange tortellini looked like carrots. Broccoli was cooked to softness, which my in-laws were fine with but I like mine al dente. 

The restaurant was kind enough to bring a dessert for my in-law&#39;s anniversary which made them feel special. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. 

Overall inexpensive and decent food."

Last time I was in I wasn&#39;t hungry enough for a steak so I went with one of the sandwiches, which was also pretty large.

I didn&#39;t think the service was anything special, you could probably go to Outback and have about the same experience at a lower cost....just sayin&#39;.

You&#39;re busy, I get it, but overestimation will get you a lot happier diners than underestimation and fibbing.

With that out of the way, Jameson&#39;s is an alright place to get a variety of foods, including steak, chicken, seafood, burgers, and sandwiches.  What the other people in our party like best about this place is the fact that you get BOTH soup AND salad with your meal.  For me, that means fill up on free soup &amp; salad, take 2 token bites of my meal, and get the rest wrapped up to be eaten in the comfort of my own home-and I&#39;m not complaining.

I got the fish &amp; chips special (it was a Friday).  It&#39;s not fish &amp; fries like most other places, it&#39;s actual homemade chips.  Because they&#39;re such accommodating folks at the ol&#39; charhouse, I was able to switch the chips for boiled potatoes.  The fish was just meh, more fried breading than fish, which was pretty darn disappointing.  The boiled potatoes were good, but I guess it&#39;s sort of hard to screw up throwing some potatoes in a pot and waiting for them to get soft enough to eat.  There are most certainly some other area taverns/restaurants that put these fish to shame.  I guess that&#39;s what I get for ordering fish at a steakhouse though, right?

The only time I come to Jameson&#39;s is when someone else is footing the bill, because frankly, I can think of at least a handful of other places I&#39;d rather eat."

They are frequently out of their special for the day.  Tonight they had &#34;1&#34; of their special dinners left, which we both ordered so my husband had to pick out another entree. This is about the 4th or 5th time we have gone there and they say they only have &#34;1&#34; of the specials left.  Then they were out of mashed potatoes, which also happens frequently.  This was at 8:00 and IMO they should not run out of dinner food that early.  Then our soups came, both were cold and had to be sent back. Not having a good night!  Our waiter was very nice and apologized and said he would speak to the manager.  The manager came by about at least 45 minutes later.  Instead of making things better he managed to make it worse.  He came to the table, did not say he was the manager and leaned in to me and said do you have a question? I said no I don&#39;t have a question. He then said our waiter said we had a question. I said no I don&#39;t have a question, are you the manager?  He said yes. I said well we have had some issues with our meals, you were out of your special, again,  out of mashed potatoes, and then the soups were cold.  He said well we can run out of things, we never know how busy it will be. He said we only make so much of the specials.  I said maybe you should make more since you frequently run out.  And how can you be out of mashed potatoes??  He did not apologize just kept making excuses why they run out of things.  I would think with as long as they have been in business and the number of restaurants they have they could better estimate how much they will need for their customers.  I was left with the impression that the owner would rather under make the amout of food than have any at all left over since it happens all too frequently.  And the manager did not offer to take care of anything for us, which would have made a bad situation better, instead he made it worse, which also is a poor reflection on the owner who probably won&#39;t allow the managers to comp anything.  The least he could have done to appease things was to offer a dessert, but he did nothing at all  So as disappointing as the meal was the manager&#39;s response made it even worse.  The only thing that was good was our waiter. He was very apologetic, which none of this was his fault.  I told him how inept the manager was and the waiter ended up comping us dessert, not the manager.  The only reason I would even think about coming back here is because the waiter was so nice, but it will be a looooong time before I think of this place, if at all."

Long story short......the group had (3) different entrees...unanimous consensus: our food and how it was prepared was very sub par; steak you could barely chew; service was &#34;bizarre&#34;; and prices for what you got was way out of line. Needless to say, never going back there again. Place was packed....we were wondering why?.

The char house is a nice steak house. This is not an Applebee&#39;s or a Chili&#39;s.  The atmosphere was very nice and the restaurant was very clean.  The parking lot was accessible and well lit.

The service was okay. My drink was refilled and was never empty.  I did feel like we were a little rushed.  The server brought our drink within a minute or two and then immediately took our order.    Our food was delivered very quickly. It was served at a good temperature.

Here&#39;s where the evening broke down for me.  I ordered the large filet mignon.  I ordered the steak medium to medium well.   When my food arrived, I cut the steak in the middle to check to see if it was cooked properly.  My steak was cooked well done.   It was cooked beyond well done.  I took two bites off of one side of the steak.

I ordered the filet mignon so that I could have the tender cut of meat. My steak was like shoe leather.

I went to my baked potato and ate it. It was not cooked through.  I will say this, my broccoli was very good. LOL

10 minutes after my meal was served, my server came to the table and asked if I wanted a to go box for my meal.  She never asked if there was an issue with the steak although she could plainly see that I&#39;d cut it down the middle and only ate two bites off of one side.

Overall, don&#39;t waste your money.  Drive a few miles and go to the Weber Grill or spend a few more dollars and go to Wildfire."

The soups were a choice of chicken noodle, French onion and clam chowder.   Had a split of French onion and chicken noodle at the table.  French onion was very good.  Chicken noodle not so much. 

Salads were basic - garlic dressing was good.  Vinagrette was boring.  

We had chicken marsala, chicken with artichokes and grilled salmon.  The grilled salmon was cooked perfectly anf flavorful.   The chicken Marsala was better than average with a good sweet sauce.   The chicken artichoke dish had a good sauce but the artichokes added nothing to the dish.  The double baked potatoes were tasteless and overcooked.

The waiter was a pro. He had an odd personality, but it worked in his favor. He made our party laugh, and when he brought our steak knives out to us after ordering, he called them our weapons. It sounded clever, but then two minutes later I heard him say the same clever things to the table behind us. That was a &#34;pull the mask off&#34; moment for me.

We started with the artichoke dip, a flavorful spread served with chips. Our dinner came with bread and butter, soup and salad. 
The cream of broccoli soup was perfect and the salad dressing was also very tasty.
My mom ordered the ribeye, the only steak she orders from here and every time it&#39;s done perfectly. I got the filet peppercorn, a special, which was crusted perfectly.

We went last night - I had New York strip and my wife had London broil. Both were fantastic. My steak was tender and cooked perfectly - the sides were also fairly good. We got out of there for less than $60 which included a couple glasses of wine - I have spent more for far worse food elsewhere. The only issue with Jameson&#39;s is the service. It&#39;s bad. Our waiter was nowhere to be found when we sat down and we had to wait about 10 -15 mins for a class of water. I don&#39;t know if the guy was in over his head - it was crowded - but it was bad for the rest of the meal. Still gets four stars because we didn&#39;t let it ruin our dinner - which was awesome. Hope to go again - perhaps on a different night than Saturday when it&#39;s less busy.

I have never once had a bad experience when it comes to food. The steaks are aged and cooked to perfection 9 out of 10 times. They definitely meet my expectaions. My favorite is their giant 28 oz bone in ribeye. Filled with tenderness and juiciness. You definitely get a lot for your money with any of your meals. First they bring you a soup with is very good. I havent had a bad soup there.  Then they brin you a salad. Again. Very simple but still very fresh crispy cold veggies. Just how I like my salad. I get thousand island dressing which is good from here, and I then sprinkle some fresh ground pepper that they have at each table.  I love their calamari appetizer but unfortunately almost TB never order it because they give you so much food and I get almost full just off of the fresh warm bread they keep bringing u....I love that stuff. 
Why do I give this place 4 stars out of 5 if im so nuts about their food? Price? No. I expect to pay what I pay there. Its not cheap but not pricey...atmosphere? Nu uh. Place is really nice and spacious. Always clean and well maintained. Beer selection? Nope. Anyone that knows me knows im a craft beer kind of guy but when im here, I cant get anything other than a nice big glass of merlot to go with my steak....my reason for it is because of the mediocre service. Its not horrible but at the same time, I have never once been impressed. The servers all act kind of snobby and if you look around, not one server has a smile on their face. Always serious and act like im doing them a favor by being there. The hostesses at the front that greet u even dont have much of a friendly welcoming attitude. Sure most of those girls at the front are easy on the eyes but ill take an ugly nice girl over a cute snob in the service industry any day. Even management is not so great with personality, also acting like they can take u or leave u being there. As if it makes no difference to them that your there.  I once had a HORRIBLE experience with a manager at the Mount Prospect location on an easter sunday. He was rude to about 4 different families while I was there as well....now some people would say, &#34;maybe he was having a bad day&#34;...well ive been in the restaurant business and customer sevice industry my WHOLE life and you cannot have a bad day in this type of work. under any circumstances.  Keep urself at home or working in the back if thats the case. Anyway, I dont go to that location anymore even though I live 8 minutes from there. I now drive out to the bloomingdale location which is further but like I said I go for the food. Not the service. While I have not had a bad experience there in Bloomingdale,  I have not ever had great service either. 
 Overall, this place is winner in my book. I just wish they would make a few changes in hospitality."

I wrote in to them via their Contact Us portion of their website to inquire about pricing on their small and large party rooms in hopes to hold my mother&#39;s retirement party there.  That was two days ago and I still have not received a response. I work two jobs and manage a small business and still find a way to get back to customers within 24 hours so I feel like there is no excuse.

Today I wrote in again only because my mother REALLY likes this place and would be beyond happy if I surprised her with a party here, but if they can&#39;t return a simple email I&#39;m not sure I would trust them with entertaining my guests.  

I&#39;ll update with the outcome!"

Got the drinks-server seemed flustered. Then he took off-waited another 20 minutes-in the meantime a table of 7 men were seated on the other side of us. Next we get a new server. Nice guy. Ordered our food-got our soups and fried calamari. Waiting waiting waiting-the table of 7 got their meals before we did!! Ours finally came out-you could tell the baked potato was sitting under the heat lamp for a while because the cheese was hardened. We told the guy right away for to go boxes-waiting over an hour for dinner was nuts-got there at 715p and we walking out close to 10p-food was average at best-overpriced-and service needs to step it up!

The soup was underseasoned broth with onions. The salad was, a salad. And my chicken entree was pounded to a pulp and pan fried with some weird, slimy coating on the outside. Additionally, I ordered a glass of wine which I never received. When I asked the server, he unapologetically said he was waiting till my entree because &#34;that&#39;s when most people want it&#34;; After having served my parents their drinks after being ordered. On top of that, I had no silverware, and the waiter was constantly dropping things on the table without seeming to care. Honestly I thought I was being punished somehow.  I could understand an &#34;off&#34; night but considering that not one food option was enjoyable and the fact that our waiter truly didn&#39;t give a crap, well neither will I."

We waited for 5-10 minutes and got asked if a hightop table in the BAR side was okay...I said, no, I&#39;m sorry, I would like a booth. We got seated at a booth in the BAR side. Host made a comment on how surprised she was that it was so busy as she was walking us to our table......it&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day - how are you surprised?! The server we had, Stephanie, was horrible. She could have been more outgoing. I was unimpressed. I ordered a vodka soda - was never asked if I wanted another one, my glass just sat empty the whole time. We had to ask for water, didn&#39;t bring it before our drinks. Everyone else was asked if they wanted more coffee or water - what about me?? Food was great - got the crab cakes for appetizer and Ribeye for entree. Chicken Teriyaki was bland. Wasn&#39;t even Teriyaki sauce!! Red potatoes were plain, not even seasoned. I just don&#39;t understand how a restaurant could be so shocked that they&#39;re busy on Valentine&#39;s Day. I was disappointed on where we were seated and the service really blew the experience. I would be back but couldn&#39;t bare to deal with the poor customer service again!

Me and my family went for my dads birthday and our server (I think his name was Nick) was needless to say not the bes) He brought my brother the wrong drink, sat it down and a miute later took it back from him and brought it over to a different table! How would he know if my brother drank out if yet or not?! My sister order some kind of pasta and got the wrong food! The server didnt bring her her corrected meal until we were already done with our meals. He never asked my dad if he wanted a refill on his coffee once! Considering we were one of the only tables in the place you&#39;d think the service would of been a little better.
Steak was good though as usual, considering it is a steakhouse, my dads salad seemed average, not worth the price though."

Once was a weeknight, once was a weekend. Both times we made reservations, so we had no wait at all even though the restaurant was full. 

One night we had chicken noodle soup and the other was cream of chicken soup. Both were good, and the chicken noodle soup was obviously homemade. Everything was prepared properly and the steaks arrived the perfect &#39;Medium.&#39; My only complaint was the quality of the filet mignon. Both nights I ordered filet mignon, and both times the meat was rather chewy and not as flavorful as it could have been. Filet mignon should be tender...this was not."

The service was poor; incorrect sides and drinks brought to the table, overcooked steak and just generally blah food. The salad came as a small dish of mixed greens with 1 small cherry tomato and dressing in a plastic cup on the side. I expect that from Chili&#39;s but not a supposed upscale steakhouse.

I liked that the dressing was provided in an individual container so that I could put on the amount I wanted.  Ordered the charbroiled chicken breast which has an herb lemon sauce.  It was great - not too lemony.  The other people in our party had steak, halibut and pork chops.  each meal was very good.  The person having the pork chops specifically commented how good they were.  Our only complaint was the amount of food.  Two large pork chops and three chicken breasts!!

My kids insisted we eat here, and in fact that frosty mug was calling them all the way from Highland Park. We needed to go shopping, so we decided to take them on a fun mall night for new sweatshirts and frosty mugs. They had a blast and loved their dinner! 

The frosty mug really is a nice touch here, and did you know the root beer is made daily with cane sugar? Yep! It may come in a soda machine, but it&#39;s still authentic with a nice smooth vanilla taste. 

The ice cream machine wasn&#39;t working so well, so instead of ice cream in a cup, they whipped up a really delicious vanilla milkshake for my hubby and charged him for the cup instead. That shake was tasty and served in a nice tall glass...perfect for sharing.

Again...beyond friendly servers, super crispy yummy french fries, and a truly favorite frosty mug of root beer. Great for kids."

It&#39;s inside Woodfield Mall, so yes, it&#39;s a busy place! And when we were there on a Saturday evening, the line was long but what do you expect???  For no one to be there? They could improve by having 2 cashiers versus just one. But the hot dog I had was great!  The corn dog bites were done really good too and great for kids! The fries were ok. Not the best, but not that bad, because I&#39;ve had worse at other places. The interior is decorated well and they have oldie songs playing in the background.  Their polar blasts are very delicious!

It also looks more fun to get your drink for there as you get to drink it out of a (root)beerstein, instead of a paper soda cup. 

Beware of the sticky sticky sticky floors by the sodas and general mall crowd. You should probably just order a root beer float and avoid the whole self-service area. Are people really so clumsy?

Next time I might just visit 7-11 next time I want some diet root beer. This was more of a novelty visit for a foreign girl secretly fascinated by American fast food."

I ordered a Papa Burger combo meal, which includes a big Papa Burger with two thick patties in a burger whose ingredients seem to be a cross of those found on a Big Mac and Whopper. It was tasty if a bit dry, and the same could be said of the fries which actually needed the ketchup. The star attraction of the combo is the frosted mug for the namesake root beer. Yes they have a big barrel there filled with A&amp;W root beer that you can fill yourself. The frothy and sweet nectar is so good (did you know it contains 14 berries, barks and spices but no caffeine?), it really made my day. Root beer on tap is way better than root beer from a can or fountain dispenser. The cashier was a bit lethargic, but otherwise I heartily raise my glass mug to toast the root beer (and don&#39;t throw that mug away!)."

We were overwhelmed by our choices, but after staring at the menu board for far too long, we did make some decisions.

They are a BYOB establishment which I don&#39;t feel we see much of here in the burbs, so that was interesting.

My wife and I hosted a rehearsal dinner for 80 people when our son got married. We are not from the Chicago area and needed to find a caterer for a pig roast. The online ratings for Steamboat BBQ sold me and we decided to go ahead with John and his crew at Steamboat after a couple phone calls. 

From the outset, they were extremely helpful and responsive. The day of the event was hectic--and John and Joe were incredibly  accomoating. They arise on time, set up quickly and even helped out with our non-food set up. In fact, they even ran out and found some baskets to facilitate a last-minute need.

And the food was absolutely perfect. Tenderly smoked pork and chicken. The bacon potato alad was other-worldly. And the bread pudding was worth the trip to Chicago all by itself! What&#39;s more, it was very reasonably priced.

Nice, local place, pleasant staff, and a plethora of BBQ sauces. We brought collectively seven sauces, but initially carried four to our table. Our rankings/favorites (top to fourth favorite) hot diggity dog, firebox hot, Apple bourbon, spicy vinegar. 

Each of us had the three meats: ribs, brisket, rib tips. And he had brisket, pulled pork, catfish. And two sizes each: I had Mac and cheese and Smokey bacon potato salad and he had beans and sweet potato fries.

Opinions/recommendations from me: get the rib tips, get two orders if you must, and the potato salad and Mac and cheese bites are heaven. My boyfriend loved the brisket. The beans had a hint of a sweetness or bourbon to it, and the fries filling with cinnamon on it. Try all of the sauces and find your favorite. Get and try all of the root beers. We tried these: butterscotch, salted caramel, sasaparilla, and a vanilla creme soda. Favorites are the salted caramel and vanilla creme (even though it&#39;s not a root beer)

We ordered the 3 meat BBQ combo dinner with pulled pork, brisket, and the pork hot link. In addition to your choice of 3 meats, you get two sides and white bread. Our sides were fries and the corn. We also ordered a side of the beans. Overall prices were reasonable. The side of beans was a little expensive, but the meat combo was only 15.

Pulled pork: 3/5 it was a little dry but still had a great flavor.
Brisket: 5/5 by far the best meat we had while eating here. It was super juicy, had a great flavor, good crust, and a good portion.
Pork Hot Link: 4/5 super good flavor with a little kick at the end.

Beans: 2/5 we both decided the beans tasted a little weird. Very sweet and apple flavored. 
Corn: 3/5 underwhelming but good flavor
Fries: 5/5 amazing. Perfect complement to the brisket. Good flavor and didn&#39;t even need ketchup.

Steamboat has plenty of sauces to try. We tried the firebox hot, Apple bourbon, and the butlers tribute. Our favorite was the firebox hot. It had a lot of flavor and a good kick towards the end.

The owner stopped by towards the end of our meal to make sure the food was good and ended up spending time talking to us. Great experience. Would definitely come back."

That being said I would maybe rate their food as a few points below other locations I&#39;ve tried. Don&#39;t take this as a bad thing. The food was tasty as heck. I just probably wouldn&#39;t make it my first choice if I really wanted BBQ. Maybe second or third.
But in any case I only had the brisket dinner so maybe not the best sampling of everything they have. I enjoyed their sweet potato fries. The bacon potato salad was also good. The brisket was tender and juicy. My only gripe is the portion size was kinda small next to other places based on what I paid. 
If you visit they have a few BBQ sauces you can choose from. I tried the Butlers Tribute and Apple Bourbon. The tribute was more akin to normal BBQ sauce while the apple one was sweeter. 
Also as an added bonus they have sweet tea! 

So all in all a great place for BBQ!"

I found this via the Yelp community, thanks for recommending this! 

It gave Q&#39;s in Naperville (my favorite BBQ place) some pretty good competition.

I ordered a pulled chicken and tried the various sauces. The meat was very juicy and seems like very good quality, the portions were generous and left satisfied. My sides were fries and potato salad. Im pretty picky about potato salad and HATE it if it tastes too much like mayo, this one was perfect. I wasnt overwhelmed by mayo. 

The seating area was very small and we were very lucky we came in when we did. A quick rush came in after us and noticed people were having trouble finding a seat. I really liked that I could see the meat being prepared while I ordered.

If I&#39;m ever around in the area again I will come back."

Went here for dinner, ordered half slab of the St. Louis style ribs with beans and cole slaw. I generally prefer St. Louis ribs because they are normally more meaty and more fatty. However, these ribs were dry and tough, like eating beef jerky on a bone. Very disappointed. They had plenty of smoke flavor, but were overcooked. 

The underwhelming un-originality of the sides made the whole meal a bust. The beans were literally Bush&#39;s out of the can with a few spices. Nothing special. The cole slaw was nearly identical to Jewel&#39;s deli cole slaw. Again, no originality in the recipes.

To complete my disappointment, my meal cost about $20. Not worth it. Sorry, guys. This is just below average BBQ."

Not easy to find good BBQ in the suburbs and this place has just made itself well worth the drive. Briscuit was rather lean and had some amazing smoke rings.  Burnt ends were incredibly flavorful. Had the fries and cornbread as sides.    Fries were fresh cut and crispy, cornbread was rather dry...  No poultry offering except wings, but if your a beef or pork fan you&#39;ll like this place. They have several different sauces all of which are rather tasty. Big reason for 4 stars is the place is a bit small and they only have two high chairs....so if you&#39;re going with a little one during busy times, be prepared to have him/her on your lap."

There are some highlights and some misses for sure.  They were doing a catering order.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was a huge hotel pan filled with chicken sitting out uncovered for what had to be 15 minutes.  They finally wrapped it but it remained out at room temperature for our entire stay.  

The ribs were ok.  I didn&#39;t really like the rub.  They have several sauces.  The mustard was the best.  The others were average at best.  The pulled pork is terrific and was the star of my meal for sure.  The slaw was cooked in it&#39;s dressing and I didn&#39;t like it but the beans were ok.  

It&#39;s a nice enough place and the staff was interested in how we liked our meal.  I think if I didn&#39;t have the world of BBQ experience, I might have given them a better rating but I&#39;ve had a lot better in BBQ country."

It definitely has that old smoker feel to it. The service is fast, mostly friendly. The meat is what&#39;s most important and that was pretty good, juicy! I had the pulled pork and tried my friends brisket, which was all right. The cleanliness of the place definitely left something to be desired. It looks like there&#39;s a pile of stuff/junk to your right as you walk in that has just been forgotten about.

I walked in and was greeted by a nice crew and a wonderful smoky aroma. I said that I loved BBQ and used to live Texas. The man behind the grill turned around said, &#34;order the burnt tips and beef brisket meal.&#34; So I did and had a bottle of Sioux City Root Beer.

I got the bender burger, which is a burger patty with pulled pork on top. You could tell just by looking at both that they are quality meat, and it was a fantastic sandwich. NOT the gooey cooked-in-sauce excuse for pulled pork most places serve; it looks like it was freshly pulled, and it&#39;s great even without sauce. The cajun fries were very good as well. Natural cut fries, skin-on, just the way they should be. I love that they offer different fry options.

 The rib tips were out of this world and it would be a sin to put sauce on them. 

I only got to try the apple bourbon and butler&#39;s tribute, but I got them mixed up, so all I can say is that they were both great. They both seemed to have a mild heat that kind of sneaks up on you, which I really liked. 

I plan on trying everything the joint has to offer as soon as possible.

The reasons it&#39;s not 5 are: 1) it&#39;s not perfect,  2) I haven&#39;t had all their sides &amp; meats yet, 3) they have Diet Pepsi instead of Diet Coke (still acceptable but not ideal) and 4) Their sweet potato fries come out overdone &amp; have cinnamon &amp; sugar on them instead of salt &amp; pepper.   

We&#39;ve been here 3x over the last few years.  It&#39;s one of our most favorite BBQ joints.  The reason it&#39;s only been 3x is that it&#39;s about a 1.5 hr drive round trip, given lights and traffic and we&#39;re seldom in the area while hankering BBQ.  When we&#39;ve been there, we have had  their pulled pork, brisket, smoked bacon &amp; pulled chicken.  All are outstanding!!  I also LOVE thier apple bourbon and butler sauces.   I would&#39;ve taken a few bottles home but we almost always have 3-4 bottles of various BBQ sauces on hand.   As far as sides, I&#39;ve only had their sweet tater fries, regular fries and their smoked tater salad.  The smoked tater salad is awesome, but I&#39;d like to have more than 3-4 ounces of it    

Service has always been great.  Very friendly, patient, etc.  We&#39;ve even met the manager on a couple occasions &amp; he&#39;s always warm and generously offers up some free samples of stuff!  Smart business plus always helps that your product is REALLY good!

As far as decor, you&#39;d easily pass it if you&#39;re driving by as the neon sign only says &#34;BBQ&#34; and it&#39;s in a strip mall.  Inside, it&#39;s your typical BBQ joint with the smoker right in front to greet you.  Not the cleanest place you&#39;ll ever see but gotta consider a man owns it, mostly male clientele,  it&#39;s BBQ and I&#39;ve always found that dive places seem to have the best food in terms of quality &amp; value."

All cooked to perfection. The burnt ends were the best either of us have ever tasted. There&#39;s about 5 different BBQ sauces you can add. The ribs and burnt ends were fine the way they were. The only thing I would suggest is the 2 different sauces labelled hot could be hotter, but that&#39;s a nit. The Mac n cheese bits were good and the cole slaw excellent. Can&#39;t wait to go back again. 

The restaurant is hard to see from the road and a bit on the small side. Approximately 8 tables inside which fill up fast.

They have sweet and sweet and spicy bbq sauce,  but even the spicy is well balanced,  isn&#39;t overpowering,  and compliments the meat..even the juices from the pulled pork mixed so well..but I definitely say spend the extra money on burnt ends..it sounds weird but it&#39;s heaven.  The onion rings are good but the fried pickles are so much better.  The owner was incredibly nice..they even had wipes along with the napkins.

It was summer, on a Friday evening so there was quite a long line. Apparently there is not much air conditioning because it was quite hot inside. After waiting in line watching the process in the kitchen I realized why it was taking so long. The kitchen staff and process was very inefficient. We finally got to place our order, then had to wait a significant time again for it to be filled. You only get a certain amount of small containers for sauces. Finally got the food and luckily my husband snagged one of the few tables. Had to eat the food while a bunch of people in line filed past. We got their supposedly famous brisket and pulled pork and ribs. They were good but nothing exceptional. A few of the sauces were quite good. Fries were ok.

I consider myself a bit of a BBQ snob but this place did not disappoint! We came during lunchtime on a Friday and waited in line for a good 15 minutes before making it to the walk-up order window. My BF got the 3-meat combo which came with bread &amp; 2 sides and I got the burnt end sandwich (that&#39;s right, they have an entire sandwich full of burnt ends!!), which came with 1 side.

The food was incredible! The pulled pork was just OK but the hot links and burnt ends were out of this world! The onion rings were fried as usual then grilled to create perfect grill marks. The cold potato salad was super unique and tasty. The coleslaw was a little dry. What really put them over the top were their homemade BBQ sauces. Although it&#39;s not unusual for a Q joint to make their own sauces the flavor of Steamboat&#39;s was unreal! I liked the apple bourbon but what really got me was the Carolina mustard sauce. I usually dislike all things mustard but it wasn&#39;t bitter and had a good amount of spice.
The portions were good too. I mean, both of our meals totaled about $25 but to those who say this place is overpriced or has small portions don&#39;t know much about BBQ. 

The Negatives: This business has gotten too big for their britches. With the crowd they draw they desperately NEED a bigger restaurant. Between the people seated eating, those waiting in line to order, and those waiting to receive their food, this place is uncomfortably crowded. Speaking of the wait to get my food, it was a little long and some others who were in line after me received their food first."

Sausage links seem easy but ive had my share of dry, overcooked ones.  These are spicy and done right, just enough moisture and not greasy.

BYOB is a nice option to keep the price down when having a couple beers with your meal.  

I have to say, the brisket (what i went for) both times Ive been, is dry. The bark is flavorful but the rest is overdone in my opinion. They grill heat it before serving but not enough to rid most moisture so assume its just their process.  This is no Texas, or even Memphis brisket. My suggestion is to ask to see it before ordering so you have a chance to tell if its overdone.  I will from now on as i dont want to write it off based on two samples.

Cornbread is good too.  Mac/cheese bites are a good appetizer and my friends liked the fried pickles.  Friend got the burnt ends and they were decent..as point part of the brisket, again bark good and more moist than the flat slices. You have meat combo options of 2 or 3 meat.  I like that so you can try a bit of everything.  

Ive yet to have the pulled pork, tips, or ribs but will go with that next over the brisket.

Sauce options are good, mustard, sweet, spicy, 

The service is good, owner/mgr comes by the table to ask how we&#39;re doin.

The prices are in line with what i expect from a local bbq spot.  Ive been by this place many times and they are usually crowded, especially Saturday.  Parking can be difficult as its in a strip mall."

Having lived in Texas for many years and call that my &#34;home&#34; state, I crave BBQ.  Steamboat fulfills my BBQ needs!!!!  The burnt ends had ridiculous flavor...crisp on some parts but still fall apart tender. Wow, my moth is watering doing this review right now.

To wrap it up...very good sized sandwich (I got the smaller one) with a side n fountain drink all for under $11.  Super full after this lunch!!!  I ordered fries as my side and they were flavorful and nicely crisp, hand cut gems.  

Get the burnt ends."

I&#39;ve tried a lot of places in the city, but their brisket is the best.  Not to say they do not have things that are not as good as other places, but I love brisket and theirs is juicy with the right amount of char.  All of their sauces are good to fantastic.  My wife and I make a 20-30 minute drive out here when we have time from South Elgin.  Would highly recommend the apple bourbon BBQ sauce if you like sweet.  The mustard rivals the BBQ sauces on the menu, which is a first for me, as most places are overly sweet with theirs or too spicy.  I normally just get the pound of rib tips and fries, which is an amazing deal, but rib tips are not for everyone.  I won&#39;t go into detail on them, but ask before getting them.

Seriously.

It&#39;s all about the food. This is some seriously good Barbeque, the best that I&#39;ve had in Chicago&#39;s suburbs.

I&#39;ve been here at least a half dozen times.. and the place is evolving. It used to be Butler&#39;s, then Smoke Ringz and now Steamboat.. Same owner for the last two places... but he kept the Butler sauce as one of his choices.

He can keep changing the name because it&#39;s not on the sign anyway. Not sure why he went with Steamboat (I liked Smoke Ringz) because there is absolutely nothing about this place that says Steamboat. Probably a more accurate name would have been something &#34;Shack&#34;... I say evolving because while shack might be appropriate for the inside now... a year ago it would have been a major  compliment to say &#34;Shack&#34;. 

He focused on the food, people came and he slowly has added some seating... and some plywood to close off part of the kitchen.. and he&#39;s got good people working there too!

Today I got sandwiches, a pulled pork sandwich and a brisket burnt ends sandwich, both with fries. Good fries, just not enough of them. Around 8$ for each of them (Brisket price was little higher) and they were excellent. I got excellent food for about what I would spend at a fast food place. I grabbed the Butler Sauce and The Firebox Hot Sauce today... they had another choice or two.. but I got what I wanted.

I usually get some ribs when I&#39;m here, they&#39;re excellent. They only offer St Louis style on the weekdays. I tend to prefer baby backs.. weekends only.

I will often get containers of Brisket or Pulled pork to take home and make a meal out of. It&#39;s a deal and we can eat for days.

A couple of things.. Only bring a first date here if they are extremely cool and like meat. It&#39;s rustic. You can BYOB, so you can go high end on some Zinfandel to go with that Brisket.

It&#39;s a small operation, they run out of stuff, so order ahead or prepare to be flexible."

My husband was born and raised Memphis, TN and I spent half of my life there, so our BBQ standards are a little different than many people in the Chicago area. Hence, we have a hard time finding what we would call GOOD BBQ......but I think we&#39;ve hit pay dirt at Steamboat! 

We stumbled in here on a Saturday evening and it immediately reminded us of a BBQ joint in the south. The delicious smell of smoky BBQ smacks you in the face as soon as you walk through the door.......yummy! There was a small crowd, but service was fast and efficient. After ordering, I went to find a table and as I walked past the open kitchen area, I saw a whole pig in the smoker. At that point, I knew.........Steamboat IS BRINGING IT!  

My husband and I both had the pulled pork dinner with fries. The dinners come with 2 sides, so my husband had Mac &amp; cheese and I had potato salad as a second side. The pulled pork was DREAMY. It was super tender and the flavor was amazing. The sides were all really good as well. The mac&amp;cheese worried us initially because it&#39;s fried triangles of mac &amp; cheese, but they were tasty. They also offer an array of sauces. We tried the Apple Bourbon sauce and we liked it so much, we didn&#39;t try anything else.

We met the owner and he is a super nice and friendly guy. He works in the kitchen and he walks around and asks everyone how their meal was. We talked to him about Memphis for awhile and he knew about all the best BBQ joints there......not just the touristy ones. He also gave our 2 boys free root beer floats!

If you want some real BBQ, you need to run, not walk, to Steamboat!"

It is the BEST BBQ joint in the Wheaton area as far as I&#39;m concerned. I&#39;ve eaten here quite a few times and never once had a bad experience.  

As odd as it might sound, I love how the place is set up. When you walk in there are a few tables to sit at, but behind the bar is this enormous smoker. It&#39;s just cool to be able to see where the magic happens, hahaha. 

Although I&#39;ve tried a few different things, my usual go-to is the pulled pork sandwich. They serve it dry but offer a ton of different sauces that you can add at your leisure. Try the meat first though before drowning it in sauce, you may just like it unsauced! I also tend to get the mac and cheese bites, because I mean.....come on......who can pass up fried mac and cheese triangles? If you&#39;re into fried pickles give those a go as well.

The service is always friendly and food comes out quick. I&#39;ve never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for my food and it&#39;s always fresh &amp; hot. For drinks they have fountain options or a cooler with various pops and such. ALSO, I should mention that they do allow you to bring in your own beer if you want to. Beer and BBQ, it&#39;s a match made in heaven.

Long story short, check out Steamboat. Instead of waiting for the summertime ribfests you can just stop by here for the best food any time of year!

Of course they vary slightly time to time - when they are at their worst, they are just GREAT, and I add a little tiny bit of sauce.  When they are any better than that - which is most of the time - no sauce, and every bit is glorious.  

I tried the pulled pork sandwich the first time I was there - good, but lots of places have good pulled pork.  It didn&#39;t knock my socks off.  The second visit I tried the brisket - wow, that was great. 

The third time I had the burnt ends - and I have never had the willpower to try anything else, there is just no way I could pass up those burnt ends.  They are usually just INCREDIBLE.   Some of the specials sound great too, but I just can&#39;t miss my burnt ends.  

I organized a group coming from work every two weeks - it is about a 20 minute drive so not easy to do too often.  Well, mostly that ends up being every single week instead - nobody wants to wait another week for their fix.  

This is an authentic BBQ place, not a swanky joint.  Also come early or late to avoid the line and for easier parking, and in good weather it is great to sit on the picnic tables on the sidewalk.  

The only complaint I can come up with is that the coleslaw is pretty poor, which is a shame because I love some coleslaw with my BBQ.  That&#39;s minor considering just how good the BBQ is."

Good hamburgers and strong drinks. Food is delicious. My absolute favorite is the short rib ravioli. The portion was so large that I had the leftovers for lunch the next day. My son swears that they have the best pizza around.

My only complaint is that at my last visit I was there for over two and half hours not because we were lounging, but because that&#39;s how long service took. She was very nice. It took forever for her to take our order and forever for us to get our check. She asked us if we wanted dessert, but I didn&#39;t want to tack on another hour. This restaurant is so busy you&#39;d think they&#39;d want to turn tables quicker."

And for lazy night...... you don&#39;t want to cook but most of boring suburb restaurants are closed..... and this place is near by my house.

Waitresses are need to be trained well. Or Ive bad bad one for 3 times. They seem nice and bubbly but no brain or cant do multitask bout serving customers. Last one was nice girl, but she brought wrong pizza. So I told her it&#39;s wrong.... she nicely smiled and said &#34; yeah right, it&#39;s wrong.&#34; And she served us another wrong pizza again..... I just don&#39;t want to get too mad at my daughters age waitress, and I said ok.....  she probably don&#39;t know the menu.

Food is just authentic junk American made Italian food. Price and food quality matched, so nothing complain. But if you expect this is as an Italian, you will be disappointed For sure."

It&#39;s definitely nicer than the older store in Schaumburg, more open and not so dimly lit. They obviously put a lot into the renovation kudos on that effort.

I guess my biggest issue is that for as large as their menu is, I seem to have a hard time finding something that I care to order. I ended up getting a beef/sausage combo sandwich, which I usually don&#39;t care to order at a sit down restaurant because I&#39;ve rarely if ever found one that matches up to beef stands like Johnnie&#39;s, Buona, Portillo&#39;s and the like. This one was OK - the Italian sausage had a bit of kick to it, which was nice, but as combos go that I know and love, the sandwich was a little short of beef. The homemade potato chips were a huge redeeming factor however. These were about as good a homemade chip that I&#39;ve had.

Our waitress was pretty good as well - I don&#39;t recall her name, but it would have been worthy of mentioning. Probably could have added a star, but given the menu - I&#39;ll stay with three."

I&#39;d like to come back and try the pizza.  We went there to see the Blackhawks opener and unfortunately it was the same day as the cubs playoff game which was on a majority of the TV&#39;s and sound. They did give our table a portable speaker we could listen to the hawks on. 
My wife and i had the streak sandwich which was so so.  The bread was greasy and soggy and the steak was a bit on the fatty side. The Fries and homemade chips were good. 
My son had the make your own pizza which was nothing special and my daughter had one of the burgers and enjoyed it.

Desert was very good. We ordered the brownie and the chocolate chip skillet. Both enjoyable. 

Our server was attentive and very pleasant. I would definitely give them another visit.

In fact, Moretti&#39;s fresh fish of the day is described in their menu as, &#34;Brushed with Italian herbs and extra virgin olive oil served with grilled asparagus, bruschetta tomatoes, red peppers and gluten free rice.&#34;.

I have the deep dish macaroni and cheese pizza with bacon. However, every time I have ordered it, there has been a problem where it ends up taking over an hour for the food to come to our table. The first time, the manager comped me a beer, which was really nice. The second time, the pizza came out with thin crust instead of deep dish, and nothing was offered as compensation and the server barely came by after realizing her error. We also ordered wings and those were really good, but they could definitely use more sauce. They were pretty dry. In my opinion, make this place a choice for take-out or delivery, but skip dine-in. Hopefully, they fix the problems with the service, otherwise they will be out of business soon. Thankfully, they have good food."

The food here actually taste pretty good.   Nothing exceptional but your pallet will enjoy the experience.  

Service = get rekt!  It&#39;s ridiculous and unacceptable especially after multiple visits.  On our last trip to this place we were seated very quickly however the waitress was extremely slow.  She got our order wrong twice.  When the manager finally came over to hopefully help our blundering bundle Betty she made matters worse.   Finally and second manager swooped in and did not save the day...  Instead they paid for my guest lemon aid.   

In conclusion, keep searching yelp for a better place to dine and drink.  Their are other places much better less than 2 miles away."

We live 5 mins away and have both eaten there and gotten delivery many times.  At first impressed but has never gone from good to great.  Tasty chicken parm but accompanying pasta was overcooked with bland marina.  Tasty thin pizza but the deep dish is so salty you don&#39;t need to refrigerate overnight.  Delivery guys are tops, servers have no sense of urgency.

I just have to stop being the one to pick it up when we order, because it&#39;s incredibly irritating to watch the workers (mostly delivery drivers) act like children while I wait to pick up. I get it, have fun at your job, but when I called to place my order it was hard to hear my polite order taker, because of the background noise. Then when I picked up our order, I had to stand and wait (which is NOT a big deal) while the girl working the counter/phone had to deal with male coworkers acting like loud children. No one else said hi, nothing as I stood there yet at least 6 other people were in and out or cracking comments and jokes through the doorway into their back area. I basically felt bad for the girl running the phones and grabbing orders, kudos to her for great multitasking skills and patience.
I&#39;ve dined in before and well, and didn&#39;t enjoy my experience of the order being made incorrectly and never getting a refill on my pop, which I felt like was ignored since I wasn&#39;t sucking down alcohol. 

Next time, the boyfriend picks up the pizza or we have it delivered."

Walked in a little after 7:00pm. I was greeted after she finished talking to her friends at the corner of the bar. To make a long story short Andrea the only bartender had dinner (pizza) with her back facing me with her friends in the bar area sitting down.. I heard stories of how she beat up someone in the street. Her friends clearly said out loud to her, &#34;Are you actually going to charge us for our drinks?...Oh ok ok....I was going to say.. You better not!&#34; They laughed. There were 4 friends in her corner and 8 others at the bar. She was inattentive and lacked customer service by far. I ordered a salad before my dinner. It took at least 50 mins to get it. I said, no problem but what was the delay?&#34; She said they were training someone. Ok no problem understandable....I guess. She sat back down with her friends. SERIOUSLY? I&#39;ve been in this Morrettis a few times and never had service like this. Ordered lasagna....then ate a few bites and wrapped it to go. Asked for managers name and Andrea said Dave. I said what&#39;s Daves last name? She said, &#34;I dont know..I guess he doesn&#39;t want us to know. &#34; I left around 9:20pm. I wanted to see the end of the Cubs game and relax but I felt shafted. I go out almost every night for dinner. I am a fantastic customer to many restaurants in the Aboretum. Btw...I mean fantastic with references. Today I chose Morrettis a tad cheaper hence my bill was $72.00 including tip for 1 person. I was sooooo dissappointed! Friends just to let you know. The food has always been fabulous including tonight but if I could show you the picture I took or the lack of maturity and consideration of the bartender you also would be appalled. Btw. I still tipped 20 percent because that&#39;s how I am. So after 2 hours there I think she acknowledged and spoke to me for 1 min total....because she had to to take an order etc. She certainly needs to stop giving away free drinks... That&#39;s a start. They can review the tapes. I left at 9:20pm Monday. Hey girl if anything that&#39;s called stealing and nobody likes a thief. Ill be at In Contro A Tavolo tomorrow night or Jimmy&#39;s Charhouse etc....some of my daily regulars.. Oh yes I was at In Contro A Tavolo last night for dinner at Jimmy&#39;s Charhouse today for lunch. Sorry but as a customer Morrettis in Hoffman Estates failed tremendously tonight in customer service!!!"

The restaurant is full and busy for a reason, the food is excellent.

And for the pizza, it is actually very good -- way beyond what I expected.  We tried both the deep dish and thin crust.  I would say these guys are as good as the Lou&#39;s, Giordanos, and Gino&#39;s around them.  We had a cobb salad and it was on point as well.

The interior of the restaurant and new and fresh.  They have a ton of TVs, and really put the other bars in the area to task.

I&#39;ve been twice, and crave it all the time.  The thing I was most impressed with were their specials.  A lot of times places have awesome sounding specials that are double menu prices.  Not here.  They even have a homemade pasta special every day.  I had gnocchi that was so good.  The chicken dishes I have had here have also been very good.  The other awesome thing is that their portions are HUGE!!!  If I wasnt such a pig I could easily make two meals even out of their lunch portions.  
If you go with kids they have dough for the kids to play with (awesome distraction technique), and they can make their own pizza (just sauce and cheese, the kitchen adds the one topping).  They also have good specials like kids eat free one night, half off pizzas another (even though the pizza did not do a whole lot for me). 
One of the times we were there we were repeatedly checked on by the manager.

Since then we&#39;ve ordered delivery from this location somewhere between 5-10 times.

Moretti&#39;s is some of our favorite pizza in the suburbs.  We&#39;ve been to Schaumburg, Bartlett &amp; Lake In The Hills locations, and enjoyed the food and good service each time, as well as having them deliver. We were told by the LITH location that they were too far to deliver to us, and were pleased when the location in Hoffman Estates finally opened up.  I went to the trouble to check with them via their Facebook page to ensure that they would deliver to us, and they confirmed that they would.

Fast forward to last night.  Had a relatively large order (3 pies) ready, and called for delivery.  I was told by the woman on the phone that we were outside of their delivery area. I mentioned that I had already verified that they would deliver, and was placed on hold.  After what seemed like an eternity, she came back on the phone and said her manager told her that they couldn&#39;t deliver, that they only went within a radius of 6 miles, and it would take them 1/2 hour to get to our home.  I placed order for pickup and drove over to the location. The trip took 16 minutes. On the way home, I stopped for gas, and still managed to complete the round trip in 45 minutes. 

Anyway, the pizza.  We ordered 3 pies, and they were all correct and well-prepared, except that we specified pie cut, which I verified (3 times!) while placing the order, and got the standard Chicago-style square cut. The pizza tasted fine, no complaints there, but if I&#39;m dropping $75 on takeout, I expect it to be prepared correctly.

We really like the food, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to drive over there in rush hour to pick up pizza every time the mood strikes, which is kind of disappointing."

So I ended up paying for a awful meal - it wasn&#39;t even half price pizza night, so I am not an ingrate, a simple hey sorry we&#39;re short handed or the pizza oven broke would have sufficed and explained why I wasted my time.

We called back at 11:05pm and placed our entire order for 5 people. Ten minutes after hanging up, they called back to inform us that they could only make pizza after 11:00pm and would not make our order for us. So here we are 5 hungry night shift nurses with no food to eat. Not good business for hospital staff that would order frequently.

EDIT: after being in contact with management they explained that the kitchen is in fact open until midnight but they only serve pizza from 11-12. The first person we spoke to was misinformed. Management sent us a gift card we used and had a much better experience the second time around."

The cheese sticks I had ordered I  had to send them back  because they weren&#39;t cooked all the way through the manager took care of that and the new cheese sticks they were good .the pizza here is mediocre at best I&#39;m glad i only paid 10 bucks for it instead of the  $24.99 or whatever it is. Every commercial break they have some D.J. playing crappy tired 70s and 80&#39;s songs that no one wants to hear  , i asked the people around me they agreed.

Not everything. The minestrone was very salty and lacked flavor and seasoning. The lasagna was a big disappointment for the soft pasta layers and solid layers of cottage cheese. The only reason I ate it was because of the tomato sauce.....it was amazing! Chunks of fresh tomatoes, tangy, juicy, and seasoned perfectly and not overly oregano laced. The sauce was the best sauce similar to Lou Malnati&#39;s sauce with California tomotoes. The service was very good."

So why a 3 star here? Cause this is one of the many Moretti&#39;s in the area, and each is a little different. The one in Bartlett is the best, the old one in Walden in Schaumburg should be avoided. 
I was surprised when I checked NoWait and there was literally no wait. Hey, have you tried the NoWait app? So far very limited in the number of restaurants available, but helpful for those that are listed...it&#39;s free, check it out.
Anyway, this Moretti&#39;s shares the parking lot with Sweet Caroline&#39;s Crab&#39;n Que, there is also a Steak and Shake , a Macaroni Grill and a closed TGIF that I&#39;m sure will be repurposed in the near future.
We ordered a thin crust sausage pizza, with fried calamari for an appetizer. Didn&#39;t want to order at the same time, an appetizer is just that and shouldn&#39;t arrive with the salad, entree, dessert or anything else. Again, we had a server who assured us she wouldn&#39;t put the pizza order in until we had the calamari. Wrong! Don&#39;t let servers pressure you into ordering at their convenience (hear me, Hon?) The calamari was pushed beneath the pizza holder, not cool. Again, Pepsi products (not a favorite) so I ordered the ICB root beer. Good, but expensive. Also It comes in a bottle, and asking for a glass is frowned upon because there drink ware is so large the root beer is lost in the glass. Really not enough room on the table for 2 drinks, appetizer, pizza and &#34;stuff&#34; so maybe stick with the bottle.
Pizza was good. Good crust. Had better, cheaper at Riccardo&#39;s in Schaumburg. 
By the time we left there was a 30-45 minute wait. 
I agree with Lindsey S., some of the employees acted like it was the first time away from their parents."

We used to go to the Schaumburg location frequently but we moved closer to the new Hoffman location. It was not busy at all when we arrived and we were seated promptly, the atmosphere was great and there were at least 4 tvs near our table. Our server seemed to be preoccupied and probably talked to us twice the whole time we were there, seemingly too occupied with standing around talking to the bartenders than waiting on us. 
The appetizers and pizza were not what we were used to from Morettis and to top it all off, the drink that I ordered, even though it was printed on the menu we were told was not available at this location. 
When I asked for a coconut water, she handed me a box of coconut water that I could buy from the grocery store down the street for much less than what we paid. 
Needless to say, if we ever return to Moretti&#39;s we will be going to their Schaumburg location and not this one."

That&#39;s an absolute rip off. When brought to the bartender&#39;s attention she was very aware of it and I wasn&#39;t the first to bring it up.

The pizza was also nothing special. If you&#39;re okay with the standard suburban thin crust you&#39;ll like it. The crust is a little different, a little more rough. It&#39;s not the worst I&#39;ve ever had, but nothing special.

The worst part is when the check arrives. Talk about sticker shock. If this place was reasonably priced I would&#39;ve given it an extra star, but the prices are ridiculous. Don&#39;t charge $16 for the smallest Margherita if you don&#39;t know how to make a Margherita pizza. At 2 people we could&#39;ve eaten at a much nicer place for the price we paid and didn&#39;t even order that much food. We paid over $40 before tip for 2 people and their 2 smallest pizzas and non-alcoholic beverages.

Pizza definitely earns 5 stars- comes out piping hot and fast- and our server was a sweetheart, but had to knock a few stars off for the girl at the hostess stand when you walk in. Very very unfriendly and gave an attitude that she was annoyed that had to do her job. This happened both when I was putting my name on the list and again when we got the text our table was ready. It wasn&#39;t overwhelming busy, so it&#39;s not like she was trying to manage a long line. I want to feel welcomed when I walk into a restaurant, not like I&#39;m an inconvenience for wanting to eat there.

We usually go to the one in Schaumburg and Bartlett(who provide great food and service). 

My experience at the new hoffman location was beyond terrible. I know they&#39;re a new location and getting used to things. The customer service was disgusting, our server was short, with long black hair so watch out!!!! She was probably the worst server I&#39;ve ever had to deal with, she didn&#39;t bring bread to our table we had to ask. She was trying to give our table away in front of us and was very rude when we asked for a refill or questions about the menu. She had no type of patience and we had to wave her down to get service. Also she would point us out to hostess&#39; and they would stare and point at us. It was the most uncomfortable dinner I had ever experienced. We planned to tell the manager but he and our server were playing around so we figured he wouldn&#39;t do anything and planned to call higher management the following day. If the place is old or new customer service should always be excellent. Also a server with blonde hair came to our table and asked how everything was and offered us more bread she was very sweet, she could probably tell that we were getting treated like dirt. 

We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza which is our favorite and it was disappointing how bad it tasted. They put so much buffalo sauce, it was burnt and the chicken tasted funky. 

Probably will never return to this location even though it&#39;s a 5 minute drive, I rather drive all the way to Bartlett to get real customer service and food."

Moretti&#39;s is owned by A La Carte Entertainment, which has been around a while and has done well elsewhere. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t seem that their experience is showing through here. We stopped by around 1:45 in the afternoon on a Friday.

First, the good...  We were seated right away. The food that we got was nicely presented and tasted good. The restaurant has nice decor, is brightly lit with a good number of TVs, and was clean.  

Now, the bad...  We had to wait a good 8 minutes or so before anyone came over to take our drink order. Then it took another 8 minutes to get the drinks to the table and place our order. We ordered an appetizer salad &#34;chopped chicken salad&#34; and a thin crust pizza with common toppings. We waited a good 15 minutes to get the appetizer and when it came out it looked not much bigger than your average side salad at most other restaurants, was small for two people to share, and missing the chicken. At this point I complained about the wait and the missing chicken and Danielle, our server, claimed it was the kitchen&#39;s fault. Not really my problem whose fault it is, but to her credit, she did do what she could to try and make up for it. She brought out a new entree size salad (now with Chicken!) and told us our pizza would be out shortly. Well, the amount of chicken in the salad was minuscule, but it was there.  Ultimately, after over an hour, we ended up getting our pizza and decided to take it to go because it took so long. She also got us a couple of to-go cups as well, which were just kiddie size cups, but she put in the effort. 

Other things I noticed - there were 3 kitchen staff sitting in the dining room having some sort of meeting while we were waiting for our food. The management was nowhere to be found and didn&#39;t seem to care that most of the wait staff was just standing around.

Again, the food was good. I might give the place another try in a few months once they work the kinks out. But the service right now needs a kick in the pants, especially if they plan to be here long-term."
morettis-ristorante-and-pizzeria-hoffman-estates,M C.,95eOar0q2H9FYEDUC65p4Q,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,1,0,0,18,ctEn6W8ntvLp39-4ROPOdQ,5.0,2015-10-17,"This restaurant has a very good variety of Italian food and other favorites such as ribs.  We have gone to this place a lot of times during peak crowded hours.  Service may not be very fast during these peak busy hours but we patiently understand the situation.   We still keep on going back to the restaurant.  When we have special occasions, we always celebrate it at Michelin rated restaurants, but when my son had his First Holy Communion, we had our small gathering at Moretti&#39;s.   That&#39;s how much we like the food there.  We rarely have dinner at home, and this restaurant is one of our favorite places.

Recently, we had a late lunch there.  Our server treated us terribly.  She was not very nice to us when we were ordering our food.  I admit I made a mistake in the food I ordered and needed clarification but the response I got was the food I want (&amp; always ordered in the past) never existed in the menu in the past 10 years she has been in that location.  (NOTE: Moretti&#39;s in Hoffman Estates just opened last year).  Her actions and words were unacceptable for an employee of a service provider.  Her mindset, actions, and words seemed to be that of somebody wanting pull and challenge a customer to a boxing ring.  She was not willing to clarify things but insisting and proving that I made the mistake.  Her focus and efforts were to prove I was wrong and she was right.  That was not what I expected to happen.  All I wanted was a clarification on what was the name of the food I always ordered.  She never gave in, I do not know why she kept on insisting on the error.  Can&#39;t understand where she&#39;s coming from.  It was a terrible experience with that server! 

I am still giving this restaurant a 5-star because the manager understood where we&#39;re coming from.  He understood that the server&#39;s behavior was TOTALLY  unacceptable.   Like what a good manager should be, he did not make any explanation or excuses.   I COMMEND him for that!  He offered to have the specific order complimentary, but we did not allow him to do that.  I made a mistake ordering the wrong food, my principle dictates I should pay for it.  The manager promised to address the situation accordingly at that moment, and we hope that&#39;s what he exactly did.

We will still go back to this restaurant.  If this bad experience happens again, then that would be the last visit and this rating will go down to zero star."

I love the outdoor and beers on  tap but the food was bland!  A salad with no flavors and the chicken and asparagus pasta special was tasteless.  The kitchen was so slow, waited over an hour and a half to get served on a Monday and the waitress was super sweet but messed up our bill multiple times.  Kids are supposed to eat free Monday but they never take them off the bill unless you ask and our friends got the wrong food after waiting over an hour.  The manager was more than kind and he compensated our friends that waited an hour and a half  for the wrong food, but overall I felt it was a waste of money for the quality of food and slow, slow kitchen!

(not sure on the spelling), she was very sweet and really knows the food and the recommendations on food choices, she was very helpful and we enjoyed our food and her service.

So many great reviews make me think I must have hit this place on a very &#34;off&#34; day. Sunday morning at 11 and the place was packed. A 20 minute wait to be seated was dwarfed by the 45 minute wait for the food. Nothing special: standard omelette, a poached egg, and a French toast. A bit pricey for food and service that didn&#39;t wow me a bit. The server apologized for the long wait but I think I&#39;ll scratch this off my weekend brekkie list for now."

there are two types of good diners.
1. super expensive + good service + good food. 

(you&#39;re paying extra for the overly polite white cloth treatment. who the hell cares about this frivolity? we&#39;re not king louis xviii or some fancy socialite)

2. super affordable + good service + good food.

jojo&#39;s is the latter. 
and i feel more comfortable at these types of places anyways. 

down to earth
fast seating, never a long wait yet always has customers inside
friendly, efficient, happy service
tasty food, arrives fast
good prices
mom &amp; pop feel

what else do you want??"

My daughter got the oatmeal topped with berries and it was beautiful to look at.  Plenty of perfectly ripened berries...straw, blue and black atop a bowl of warm oatmeal.  She loved it.  Their Greek yogurt with berries looked awesome too.  I was basic with an order of eggs and bacon.  

Their lunch and dinner selections looked solid.  This is one of the few diners that stays open past 3:00 p.m. so if you crave diner food later on in the day they have you covered.

When you order a meal, and chose the soup--the menu says &#34;cup&#34;.  What you get is a generous bowl!

- Food arrived cold (both skillets)
- They didn&#39;t bring milk for our son although it was part of the meal
- They didn&#39;t bring us utensils until after we asked for them and this was after food was already on our table!
- My wife&#39;s skirt steak skillet had a &#34;mystery meat&#34; in it aside from the steak. I guess they must&#39;ve mixed it up a bit when cooking in the kitchen. Not the end of the world but come on, guys...
- Even the coffee is watered down. Im not expecting Starbucks but just do it right...
- My wife&#39;s steak skillet was so bad she didn&#39;t finish it so we took it home. Our dog didn&#39;t care for it either and that&#39;s bad!

On the bright side my veggie skillet was good. Cold but good. Not good enough to add stars, though.

Friendly staff - Warm and welcoming from the host to the bussers to the servers! Our server was an efficient pro and ensured that food came out quickly. 

Plenty of seating - Lots of seating options - booths, tables, etc. 

Diverse menu - This is where Jojo&#39;s really shines. I was enamored with my breakfast sandwich stacked with awesome ham (same ham but different cut as famed Mr. A&#39;s in Arlington Heights), fried egg, cheese on perfectly toasted bread. With my guidance, my toddler ordered just two pumpkin pancakes, an order that was both delicious and substantial. Not only was the texture great but this fall treat was none too sweet. See what I did there? The menu isn&#39;t quite as &#34;fancy&#34; as Wildberry but it&#39;s a definite step up from many of the other local bfast options.

It&#39;s also worth noting that this locale is super kid friendly! I spied tons o&#39; families and little ones being occupied by crayons, high chairs or whatever else they could find on the tables.

I had spent the night drinking with my buddies until the early morn.  My hair was greasy and disheveled.  My body full of odors.  My shoes were only partially on my feet because I was too hungover to bend over and put them on the rest of the way.  But no worries.  I was welcomed with a smile and a lovely seat with my compatriots.  

The coffee.  Very good.  Warm, with plentiful refills.  Good rich, robust flavor.  Dark yet accessible.  It served.  I felt better immediately.

Next I visited the restroom to blow my nose.  It was at capacity and needed draining.   I accidentally walked in on a gentlemen defecating loudly.  My only gripe with Jojo&#39;s is that there is no lock on the single person restroom door.  I saw the man defecating and we locked eyes.  It was awkward but we both understood that this feeling of shame would soon pass.  I anticipate a future friendship.  The bathroom was adequate.  It served.  

The arrived quickly and me and my compatriots were for the most part impressed.  I ordered the Steak Skillet.  It served just fine.  Plenty of food.  I even got a to-go box.  I recommend Jojo&#39;s to the masses.  A fine establishment."

I ordered a crepe that supposedly had creme englaise but I don&#39;t think it did. The crepe itself wasn&#39;t very good and it contained bananas that seemed past their prime. 
The service was what made it clear this was not a place we&#39;d be returning to. Our waitress was throughout a typical diner waitress... not overly eager to provide great service... but when we asked for a to go box she said &#34;sure&#34;, walked away... and then proceeded to go outside for her cigarette break.

Both our omelettes were huge and delicious and the coffee never got below half a cup.  I added spinach to my omelette &amp; it was only a 60 cent upcharge (that&#39;s exactly how much I think it should be, but you&#39;d be surprised how many places charge an extra $1.50 for what amounts to, at the most, 1 C. of chopped fresh spinach).

It was a busy Saturday morning and it didn&#39;t seem like they had the servers divided up evenly with the number of occupied tables.  Our server was running her butt off to keep up, all with a big smile on her face.  She even cleared many tables.  Meanwhile we could see a gaggle of servers &amp; bussers just standing around in one corner chatting.  I&#39;m not sure what was up, but we felt bad for our server, as she definitely could have used some help.

This location (in it&#39;s various incarnations under different management) does cater to a mostly older crowd.  But you know what that means?  Less crying babies &amp; toddlers tossing their Cheerios at you. ;D"

We ordered Eggs Benedict and Corned Beef Hash skillet. Both were under seasoned (if at all seasoned?). The corned beef had huge chunks of onion and a lot of potatoes &amp; not a lot of beef. The eggs Benedict were subpar. The hollandaise sauce wasn&#39;t very creamy &amp; a little chunky. The good things are the prices (we paid less than $25 for the food plus 2 coffees) and the very friendly staff. Probably won&#39;t come back though.

To begin with, by the time we arrived to the place it looked packed and when we walked in there were 2 families ahead of us so I gave my name to the host and in less than 10 minutes we were seated. Not long after that our server came and offered us coffee, which we did have some coffee. Minutes after they took our order. My father ordered the stuffed French toast, my mom had the chorizo wrap, as for me I had the heart to heart with feta cheese with multigrain toast.

The good: clean setting, cheap food, huge portion sizes, super-friendly and accommodating staff.

The bad: food was under-seasoned, bland.  Had to add lots of salt and tabasco to enjoy my corned beef skillet (no I am not a typical salt-a-holic, seriously).  I was promised great Kona coffee, it was Kona, but again watered-down.  Finally, this place seems to attract older folks - nothing wrong with that but if you are looking for classier, trendier, hop place, it&#39;s probably not for you.  At the risk of sounding ageist - do older folks write yelp reviews?

Bottom line: glad I tried it, it was different from my go to place Richard Walkers,  which IMO has better coffee, food and closer to home, albeit slightly more expensive.  Stop by and try for yourself!"

So why the three stars? Two things, first, I think the bacon was microwaved. Not to heat it up, but actually cooked in the microwave.  The other issue was the very weak coffee.

The eggs were delicious but my wife&#39;s hash browns were not very warm. The place is small and cozy but had a good amount if dining space. The negatives were the temperature if the hash browns my wife got as well as the service. To be honest this is where it hurt them. The waitress seemed to to busy talking to take our order and only checked in with us once. The rest of the time she passed by with coffee and gave us a stare even though we were out of drinks. When we checked out they did not ask how our dinning experience was and just asked for our money for the bill. Know how you can tell if a business cares about how they are doing? They will ask you for feedback.

The menu is currently a little limited for dinner (but the lunch &amp; breakfast menu is huge!).  What I can say is that the burger I had was fresh made, with fresh toppings and was delicious!!!  My wife tried the greek chicken and was equally impressed.  I&#39;m happy to say there were very obviously fresh vegetables and the french fries seemed made from scratch too!!!

The service was not awful, but it&#39;s the reason I cannot give it 5 stars.  Our server was pleasant, but forgot some simple things (butter for rolls, ketchup).  Nothing huge, but a point to work on.  I really hope they are able to make it and look forward to seeing new items on the menu!"

The place was full...mostly with older people and very few children.  It&#39;s always good when there&#39;s no kids wreaking havoc and coughing all over the place.  
We waited about 10 min to get a table.  
The menu was fairly extensive and probably should be scaled back a bit. 
The tables have way too much stuff on them and feel crowded.  There was a butter bowl, a creamer bowl, a jelly holder, salt/pepper, hot sauce, ketchup along with cups and saucers.  They also have a bar area with 5-8 seats facing a few TVs.    
 I had a denver omelet that was prepared well and featured good flavor.  It comes with toast or pancakes.  I chose pancakes, but should have gotten toast.  The pancakes were underwhelming and sugary with a hint of cardboard taste...not good.  
The service was okay, but could have been better.  I ran out of water and was never refilled.  
The inside was old looking...like a diner should be.  It reminded me of going out to eat with my grandparents when I was little.  
Bathroom was clean, but a bit small.  
Overall, this is a nice diner and has fair prices.  It&#39;s not going to blow you away modern decor and unbelievable food, but it&#39;s definitely worth checking out.  Judging by the amount of people in there, others agree."

I am a fan of mom and pop diners and had hoped this would be another I could add to my list but it did not Make the cut. I tried 2 times and found the soup was average there is no bread basket and both meals were not cooked quite right and the quality was only fair. To top off the experience the wait staff was not attentive and had no personalities. Next time I want a good breakfast or a diner style lunch it will be back to the Egg Basket or Wild Berry.

My husband and I ordered takeout, and the only reason why I didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars is because the delivery took forever (I guess there was a road block...). 

I ordered their ceviche and chili rellanos. Both were totally delicious. My husband got a burrito and their chicken flautas. I&#39;m not a HUGE fan of Mexican food, but I would definitely order from there again. The food was authentic and not gimmicky. My chili rellano was perfect. Just the right amount of heat and cheesy-ness. The show stopper was for sure the ceviche. Fresh and light. The perfect combo. 

I want this place to do well. There aren&#39;t many GOOD Mexican restaurants in the area and I want to see a small business thrive, so if you&#39;re in the area PLEASE stop by or order their takeout. You will not be disappointed!"

It&#39;s in an unassuming strip mall and looks tiny from the outside but man is it good. It&#39;s your traditional Mexican food with flair. I tried the pechuga rellena and it looked like an art piece when it was brought to the table. The sauce that comes with it is a delicious cream sauce and isn&#39;t spicy but adds great flavor. We also had the ceviche as an appetizer and it was good. I&#39;ve tried it at other places and flavor wise other places are better but it&#39;s still good.

  My bf ordered tacos de carne asada with lettuce cheese and avacado like always lol. I ordered the chilaquiles with chicken and scrambled eggs. They stop serving breakfast at 11am and it was 12 but I was in the mood for this plate and our waitress said it was fine.

When we arrived, we were surprised by the modesty of its appearance from the outside. It looked like a hole in the wall restaurant similar to many fast food joints we have been to BUT as soon as we walked into the door, we were once again surprised. The tables were set up in a comfortable arrangement. We were immediately greeted by their friendly staff who ushered us to our table. They offered tortilla chips as complimentary. After we placed our order, the wait was longer than we expected but good food takes time. As our anticipation built, the food was served along with 3 types of hot sauces. The presentation of the dishes was visually inviting. Shrimp and steak were perfectly cooked. I chose the fiery diabla hot sauce to go with my seafood dish and added more hot chili sauce to fan the flames. It was a partay in my mouth. The food was so good we went quiet and just dug in. The only sounds we could hear were utensil swishing and mouth munching. I shamelessly stole my neighbors food so I could enjoy a bit more of what this place had to offer. Not disappointed at all.

This 5 star rating and review is based off of only their Shrimp and Fish Tacos...GREEN SAUCE!!!

That green sauce, man, ohh mannn.  FRESH and refreshing.  On point, and it&#39;s a good sign my friend.  (you can argue for it to be spicier)

Big succulent shrimps perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Due to a number of bad experiences in the past (places love using those smaller/tinier shrimp ahem Chilango), I rarely ever order shrimp tacos when dining out.  I feel like it was a sign from God, lol, to be reintroduce to SHRIMP tacos.

Fish tacos were just as good...okay okay, they weren&#39;t as good as those shrimp tacos and I&#39;m generally a fish taco guy.  Still, they were SOLID (strong solid, if my bold wasn&#39;t clear enough) with the lime and avocado.

The craziest thing was.....I didn&#39;t even use the green sauce on my tacos because they were just perfect the way they were.  Homemade style indeed.

My only minor gripe, being a 5&#39;6 guy, I would need at least 4 tacos.

Let me echo a common theme here, fresh! Everything from the chips and salsa, the tortillas, and the meat was just absolutely fresh and delicious.

I kept it pretty simple with a tamale and a couple of tacos. You would think that in order to call yourself a Mexican restaurant you would be able to master these staples. I have had some bad tamales and tacos and my days, but I can honestly say these were the best!

I am not exaggerating here. Absolutely the best tamale and the best authentic Mexican tacos I&#39;ve ever had in my entire life! Congratulations on earning my first five star review!"

This space was a hot dog place for years, nothing new seems to last. Kind of tucked into the corner of a not so great, tiny, strip mall. Not a lot of parking. My Cocina, however, has all the makings of a fantastic place to eat. The owners have done a great job remodeling. The place is bright and clean.
Went the first time on Sep 4th with my husband and son. I had chicken enchiladas wtih salsa verde, my husband had carne asada and chorizo tacos, my son had pescado-tilapia tacos. Everything was very tasty and fresh. We did start with cazuelas, which was ok, only becasue it was served in a bowl and pretty much turned into a large lump of cheese. Still edible and flavorful, would be better served in something that retains a little heat.
Today I had lunch with my mother. I had pastor tacos, she had carne asada tacos. The pastor was the best I&#39;ve ever had, flavorful and tender. I also had esquites, seems pretty typical, loved it. We were also given a chicken enchilada with salsa roja to try. That&#39;s what I&#39;m getting next time! 
What I appreciated most was that everything is fresh, and the enchiladas are not hidden underneath a blanket of cheese and too much sauce. The owners are using family recipes, and it shows. They&#39;re happy to talk to patrons. I hope they make it!
Update: I&#39;ve been to My Cocina 6 times now since Sep. 4. I need to add that the quality and service is very consistent. So far, the sopa de albondigas is my absolute favorite.
Nov 1: Went for breakfast with 4 other people. Excellent! My family and I, or just myself, have been to My Cocina Mexican Grill once a week since Sept 4."

The steak was undercooked, they forgot food for my order and didnt even offer to bring it back out, ordered a mango drink and got pineapple ordered a MEXICAN dinner and didnt get tortillas, ordered 3 chicken tamales and got 2 and the third was something different. The shrimp ceviche was disgusting and mostly juice. The torta cubana was more like a house special torta, nothing that shouldve been on it was besides the ham. I honestly would not recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic food worth the prices they charge. Furthermore the customer service is non existent. Instead of offering to fix the meal she said she&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s better next time....why would there be a next time?"

No, in all seriousness, the food court restaurants here are genuinely all excellent. If you have time to make it to Daruma in Schaumburg, do that, but if you want a quite and authentic bite to eat, Mitsuwa is just the ticket.

How do you explain it? It&#39;s a mall... and a grocery store... and it has a food court of really good restaurants? Calling it a mall puts you on the wrong footing, though. You EXPECT bad food. Here, any one of the restaurants could be an independent restaurant, and you wouldn&#39;t bat an eye at the quality of the food.

Where to start: ramen. If you haven&#39;t had restaurant grade ramen yet, you&#39;re in for a treat. Plus, the flavors tend to be agreeable to newcomers.

Only downside I can think of is the price. It usually comes out to about $15 per. That&#39;s a hard sell for me, but if you&#39;re really wanting sushi, it&#39;s damn good sushi."

Mitsuwa is like a mini-indoor mall.  Grocery, bakery, liquor, bookstore, cosmetics, and food court all rolled into one.

My first time there are information overload, there is so much to look at.  The second time i went, the honeymoon phase was over and now i looked at it more objectively.  They have items there that I recently purchased on Amazon and spent more on! (Rice paddles, rice strainers etc)  
As I&#39;ve never prepared Japanese food at home, i probably get less from this grocery store than die-hards would. They certainly have sushi grade fish and all the fixins. Real wasabi horseradish root (rhizome actually)! (Well i think it&#39;s real)

I definitely prefer a Chinese bakery to a Japanese one; just personal preference.
The liquor store has a huge selection of sake you won&#39;t ever find at Binny&#39;s (I know)  The bookstore is really cool.  Makes me wish i knew the lanquage.  The stationary was really cool, nice papers, pens, mechanical pencils. 

I will likely be back to explore some more"

It turns out that the hotel gets loads of Japanese guests who stay there because Mitsuwa Marketplace is across the street.   The shuttle driver said that the parking lot for this smallish Japanese mall is always full.

I will stop here to relieve the misery of traversing Chicago by car whenever I have the chance.  The food court is the most extensive, droolworthy cornucopia of tempura/ramen/rice bowl fantasy.    It is impossible to choose what to get,  because you want everything, from each stand.   At least you can gaze at all the plastica replica meals as long as you like without putting on any weight.

This place should be on all the tourist maps as a cultural attraction, let alone a culinary spectacle."

Any time we make it into Chicago from Milwaukee we always stop by here for some delicious ramen, bubble tea, and a quick jaunt around the grocery store.

This place has anything you&#39;d ever want and everything is top notch in quality and price.  It contains a vast selection of options within the food court (ramen, sushi, teas, udon, etc), a grocery store that supplies not only packaged goods, but fresh fruit and vegetables, and other stores that sell liquor, books, and make up products.

First timers... you will feel overwhelmed from all the awesome!  Take a breath and eat all the delicious things. 

Some places only take cash in the food court, so they graciously provided an ATM within the lobby area."

In all my years shopping at the local grocery store, I have never been asked about my sauce selection. Normally, your average grocery experience is you pay at the register, get your receipt, grab your bags, and head out the door. Mitsuwa is not your average Asian grocery store. I paused for a moment to digest this query and then I said, &#34;Of course!&#34; I realized afterwards that the complementary condiments were for the spicy tuna sushi I had purchased.  This personalized experience left me with good impressions thus leading to this awesome five star review. 

Mitsuwa carries an assortment of Asian (mostly Japanese and Korean) goods, more so than any other Asian grocery store I&#39;ve visited in the Chicagoland area. Be it H mart, Tai Nam, UniMart and Joong Boo markets, none match the quality, variety, and rare selection of goods Mitsuwa offers. It&#39;s clean, you don&#39;t smell anything foul lingering, and the aisles were organized. Their food court appears to have better selections and if you go in the late afternoon, they slash the prices on their sushi! They also offer a plethora of things besides food such as imported household appliances, and cook ware.

I&#39;ve read criticisms from prior reviews regarding the affordability of this grocery store. I guess it depends on what you buy. I bought mostly veggies, sushi, Green tea Mochi, Nori, and some noodles (Udon and Ramen). My total bill came out to be around 20 dollars. However, if you buy their meats, seafood, and sauces, the cost easily skyrockets. 

Lastly, the parking lot is big and can handle large volumes of customers even on their busiest days. Definitely worth the trip and visit."

I particularly wanted to leave a review on their to-go sushi selection at Mitsuwa (the ones located right outside the cash registers by the grocery store). If you have the chance, try their &#39;Spicy Salmon Bento&#39; (basically spicy salmon over rice). AMAZING. But their other nigiri bento boxes...? I feel like they aren&#39;t as fresh as they could be. I never once thought their nigiris were good or fresh.

FYI...If you&#39;re looking for the onigiri (the triangle rice balls), walk around the display with all the bento boxes/sushi to the food court side. They usually sell out by early afternoon (especially on weekends), so I suggest making your way over to Mitsuwa early if you are hunting for them."

I loved that we had 7-8 restaurants to choose from - sushi, ramen, Korean, tempura, a BBQ place, a tea stand, a bakery and some other stuff. The ramen place appears to be the most popular but it&#39;s &#34;okay&#34; IMO, I&#39;d go for the tempura place or sushi next time. Speaking of sushi, it&#39;s premade but absolutely gorgeous - we were tempted to grab some but worried it wouldn&#39;t survive the 1.5 hour drive home. 

In the grocery area, everything looked to be very clean. There&#39;s a giant produce section, a liquor department, a full fish counter, tons of sauces and ingredients to make things at home and bulk staples. We picked up some fun snacks, chili oil, candy and ramen to take home. No crazy flavored Kit Kats though - that&#39;s a bummer. Prices seemed fine - they&#39;re probably a little higher on some things but much of it is unique. 

If you&#39;re into Asian beauty stuff there is a Shisiedo counter in store. There&#39;s also a natural health stand and a small but really well stocked health/beauty section. Know that they stock a good variety of (mostly) Korean skincare stuff including serums and sheet masks - including My Beauty Diary mask packs (10pcs) for $15! That&#39;s a really good deal as non Asian retailers really mark them up. So you know I stocked up! Plus they have hand, foot and lip masks too to ensure that you&#39;re completely hydrated at all times. 

Anyway, I&#39;m a pretty big fan of this place. I can do a huge beauty stock up (much to the irritation if my husband), grab tasty snacks and eat lunch all in one place, all at reasonable prices."

I had never heard of Mitsuwa, so I had no idea that was actually a Japanese chain store (and not just some Japanese-named place in the suburbs).  A friend took me here because we both wanted Ramen and I had never heard of this place.

There are so many things happening inside here.  There&#39;s liquor, a full grocery store, a giant food court, a bakery... seriously, so much under this roof.  All of the food court places share the table space but the turnover is fairly high so we had no problem getting a table for two.  It was lunchtime on a Sunday so it was pretty busy but that didn&#39;t deter us.  My friend had specific opinions about the ramen place we go to but all of the food looked delicious.  There was even an entire food place dedicated to tempura.  If the ramen bowl weren&#39;t so huge I would have gone to get some of that tempura.  Next time...

The grocery store is great.  If you have time to just wander through all of the aisles, do it.  We probably looked at every item in here and we really enjoyed it.  There&#39;s obviously a ton of stuff that you don&#39;t find at chain grocery stores so if you are in the need of various Asian sauces, spices, or condiments make sure you get them here.  They also have an extensive collection of Japanese and other Asian candy to meet every need.  

Oh, and if you need a rice cooker... they have about 2821 models so you&#39;re totally set.

The parking lot was big enough and we didn&#39;t look for parking too long and Mitsuwa is very close to I-90 so you can get here from the city pretty quickly.  I can&#39;t wait to come back and try more food and pastries.  Yum!"
mitsuwa-marketplace-arlington-heights,Brittney H.,OdlV1c-7L-ZMOb6cAf7BNg,"Bakersfield, CA",1,1,1,94,40,nF00e4YYdjj60iCfYcXTjw,5.0,2016-03-15,"As a foodie, Mitsuwa is one of my favorite places to go, ever. So. Much. Food. For those of you who have never been, Mitsuwa is a giant Japanese marketplace. It includes a Kinokuniya (Japanese bookstore), food court, bakery, a liquor store, video store, and a full fledged grocery! Anything you could possibly think of, they probably have it. I even found the elusive teddy pop candy that I love here (very hard to find)! 

The bookstore sells manga (in Japanese and English), children&#39;s books, stationary, pens, pencils, etc. You get the picture! The food court now includes a tempura place, a VEERY popular ramen place, a Korean place, a Sutadon place, a deli type area where you can get pre packaged Japanese food (sushi, gyoza, edamame, baby octopus, etc) and an ice cream place where you can get ice cream (they have weird flavors like black sesame and lychee), soft serve (vanilla/matcha swirl!), parfaits, and espresso/matcha drinks. 

The Sutadonya is my favorite place to eat so far. I had been craving Japanese curry something fierce, and Sutadonya hooked me up! I got garlic pork curry rice and a side of Japanese potato salad with cabbage. Delicious! But make sure the first thing you do when you get to the food court is find a seat- it gets packed. 

The grocery sells a WIDE variety of foods, beauty products, and cooking products. For instance, I got some Sakura lip balm, a strawberry milk face mask, peach hand cream, instant curry, melon cream soda, and several bags of hard candy. My friend bought kewpie Japanese mayonnaise, rice crackers, and banana ice cream sandwiches. 

The bakery is my favorite part. Not only do they sell bread but they also sell sandwiches (egg salad, tuna salad, chicken salad, yakisoba) and Nikuman (steamed meat/veggie bun) during the winter time! Highlights for me would be anything cream filled, curry pan, corn mayo pan, and chocolate melon pan. 

If you&#39;re considering checking out Mitsuwa, just do it! :)"

After all these years and many ramen newcomers in Chicago and burbs, this place is still the best place for ramen!  There is a new udon soup place that replaced the other; it&#39;s good but way more expensive than the restaurant it replaced.  I love the green tea ice cream place and looking forward to try the new crepe/bubble tea stand.  There is also Korean, tempura rice bowl and a pork specialty food stands.  Lots of good food choices in the food court.  If you want sushi, they have a big selection in the grocery store that you can buy and eat at the food court. Decent sushi at really good prices. Just come early enough because it&#39;s pretty much picked over by dinner time.

My son loves the book store and always buys his Hunter Hunter books here along with other anime mangas.  They also have cute Japanese stationary and toys.

I love the grocery store where I can pick up Asian items I can&#39;t find in a normal grocery store like huge bottles of good soy sauce, ponzu, frozen udon noodles, fish cakes, Yan Yans, Pocky Sticks, Japanese candies, snacks etc!

Finally, we always have to visit the Hippo bakery and get the roll with cream, yum!  

There is also a Sheshido makeup counter and another stand that I can&#39;t remember what they sell besides those yummy specialty tins of Japanese cookies. Lastly, there is a video store but I&#39;ve never really explored it."

There&#39;s everything you need to stay occupied for hours, it&#39;s a Japanese grocery store, food court, book/stationary store, bakery, and Pokemon gym all in one. They make fresh sushi and you can even get fatty tuna here! From the food court, I had one of the best ramens I&#39;ve tasted outside of Japan, an absolute must try and I would come just for the ramen. They take cash only at most food court spots and there is an ATM."

Parts feel run down and grungy. Parts are empty. Much is disorganized and messy. Regardless there is enough solid stuff intact to score a solid 3.5 stars. 

What&#39;s good:

* The grocery store is still quite good. Large and deep selection of Japanese goods straight from Japan. Many things that you will not find elsewhere. 

* The bookstore is now run by a new company and while its magazine selection is not as good as the previous version other aspects are better. Good selection of Japanese pens and stationary in addition to books. 

* Liquor store will not blow you away but is solid with good selection (but not great selection) of often hard to find Japanese beer, sake, whiskey, etc. 

* Half the food court. What&#39;s there is good... See below for more. 

* The bakery. It&#39;s easy to feel as if you are in Tokyo while here, but why make people enter it through the grocery store?

The Bad

* Maintainance is poor. Bathrooms are disgusting. In general everything is old and worn. 

* Food Court is a massive missed opportunity with huge lack of seating. It is crowded all the time virtually all day. People want to eat here. Yet they have no true sushi restaurant (only pre made ridiculously giant grocery store sushi) and its chaotic and messy. What&#39;s there is good but it just should be so much more. They recently added a tempura place, smart move. The Ramen place is always good. The Udon shop and ice cream shop are both currently closed but claim they are coming back. The bakery entrance should be moved into the food court. Additionally the mostly empty cold cases and abandoned gelato counter should be removed. A large conveyor belt sushi restaurant would slot in there perfectly. Finally just clean it! The faux roof tops over the facades once were cute, now they are gross and covered in dirt. 

* Many shops have closed. Once there was a toy store, a stationary store, a travel agent and a housewares store, now all gone. They have very cheap seating tossed in these spots as overflow for the food court. Rip this stuff out and design a nice large dining area here. 

Mitsuwa is an inch away from being just stellar. Instead it misses the mark time and time again. But despite these shortcomings it is worth visiting and hoping that they get things back on track. It&#39;s a fun destination worth a drive even from the city. If they would polish it up and correct some problems with the food court I&#39;d visit 3x as often."

I like finding and trying unique products you find without having to drive into Chicago. I am not a fan of their pre-packaged sushi, as I found a hair in one. But the food court area has some of my favorites, like a lychee smoothie and udon noodle bowls. I also like the liquor area and weekends when you can tastes samples. I got my friends hooked on the lychee saki when I bought it for a gift. (So I have a thing for lychees)! I also like that they have larger bags of my favorite candies, like Hi Chew. And the BAKERY...OH MY, THE BAKERY! I love the sweet breads and crustless loaves of bread. They are great for French toast, grilled cheese and cucumber sandwiches.

Upon entering, you&#39;ll find a store selling books, stationary, toys and trinkets.  The next store you&#39;ll approach is the liquor store.  I found many Japan imported drinks such as flavoured, sparkling sake and gigantic cans of Asahi beer.  My favourite section is the food court. You can start off with a tasty bowl of ramen, head over for some freshly fried tempura, or if you&#39;re hankering for something else, there is also Korean food vendor. Lastly, but not least, finish your meal by heading to Re leaf Matcha cafe for coffee/dessert.  After all the eating, I took a walk around the grocery section only to find more Japanese snacks that I couldn&#39;t resist buying.

There are so many facets to Mitsuwa which make it so lovable...For me one of the biggest things is that it does not stink. I&#39;m sorry, but with asian supermarkets, that is a definite thing (loookin at you, H Mart). 

When you think of a grocery store and what they carry, Mitsuwa carries all of that, and then some- but everything is the real deal, from Japan. You will find cookware, bento boxes, toiletries, cosmetics, flatware, frozen foods, candy, snacks, grains, spices, seafood, etc, etc. All of the aisles you&#39;d find in a Jewel, you will find here. But everything is way charming and Japanese. Hello, Hello Kitty kikkoman.

The first time I went I was happy to find lots of cookware and bento accessories- walked away with bento stuff + this amazing gingham parchment paper-- because I&#39;m the type of person who just needs gingham parchment paper. The second time, I went more food shopping, and was happy to find 2 liters of my favorite Ito En teas, SUN NOODLE RAMEN packages-- this is the real deal stuff they use in the fancy USA ramen places--, fresh Pocky, very cheap and fresh veggies, cut up chicken pieces with skin on (harder to find than you would think). I was pleased to discover that all the grocery items were fresh- including the dried stuff.

PLUS there&#39;s an amazing truly wonderful foodcourt. The ramen at Santouka (cash only) stands among the best bowls of ramen I&#39;ve had in my life. The combo ramen &amp; rice bowl/donburi I love because it&#39;s so bold. It&#39;s like. Why WOULDN&#39;T you eat a bunch of noodles and chase it with rice? Can I request the next pizza place I go to to offer me a side order of pasta, just cause....carbs? I regret to say I have yet to try any of the other places, because I am a ramen snob and can&#39;t turn down an amazing bowl when it presents itself to me. The matcha place is also fun. 

Also, since no one has said it (though I admit I haven&#39;t read all 600+ reviews), there is a KINOKUNIYA here. It&#39;s the bookstore everyone is referring to. As a ex-new-yorker who TREASURED and revered the Kinokuniya in NYC, I was sooo happy to see it!

Mitsuwa, maybe this is blasphemy, but you might be my favorite thing in Chicago so far."

The food court did not let me down. It&#39;s about 30 min away from downtown Chicago. 

The sushi (California roll) wasn&#39;t the best sushi I&#39;ve had. The roll was large but the actual sushi was too cold. 

I also had a garlic pork rice bowl, and it was so tasty. The pork was very garlic-y, and the portion size was decent for $7.99. It had onions and green onions as well. 

Last stop was Matcha Love. I got the Mixed Soft Serve, which was matcha and vanilla ice cream. A must try if you love anything green tea! 

The actual store was alright. I thought the prices were high compared to where I live. I liked the selection of beauty though. 

I went back and ordered ramen (miso ramen), and I thought it was on the salty-er side. The portion size was good for $7.99."

As much as I am embarrassed to admit I read Buzzfeed, I&#39;m over the moon to have found out about Mitsuwa. If you love everything Japanese, this is the place to visit! 

For those of you wandering what this place is, it&#39;s a grocery store along with a food court. There are a couple of stores as well, among them a bookstore and a video store. As soon  as you step into Mitsuwa you will be transported to Japan. Every sign, ad, label is written in Japanese. The store carries most staple Japanese products. Several reviews mention how expensive things are, especially the produce and seafood. But that is understandable as everything is imported from Japan and some of it is flew in daily. It also carries a lot of Japanese beauty products and kitchen items. 

I&#39;m a big fan of Japanese snacks and I could not believe the huge selection of snacks they have. I filled up my small cart with of all sorts of goodies.

The food court is small. There a few places to choose from but all of them several options in their menu. I got a tempura meal which came with a side of miso soup. It was spectacular and the portion was huge. I was not able to finish my meal. For dessert I had green matcha and vanilla soft serve and it was delicious. What soft serve isn&#39;t am I right? 

I will definitely be coming back to Mostra. I don&#39;t care if I have to drive two hours to come here. That&#39;s how awesome this place is."

Mitsuwa was the first stop and I was excited to look at the sushi bc ppl were raving about it on Yelp.  

For the pre-made sushi food court: 1.5 stars 
The pre-made sushi at the front of the store looked ok but not great so I bought a spicy tuna roll to be safe and tayaki. The sushi was terrible, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a bad spicy tuna roll until I went here... I ate a piece and threw it all away.  It was so bad.  The fish tasted bloody and the spicy sauce was barely present but did not taste good.  Definitely rice heavy too. 
The tayaki was not good either, it tasted like it had been sitting there for a long time.  I&#39;ve only had tayaki freshly made and this one was hard and just did not taste right. I was so disappointed. 

For the grocery store itself: 5 stars 
I walked around the grocery store, almost every aisle, and I have to say they have so much stuff!! I was fascinated and have never been inside a huge Japanese specific grocery store.  I&#39;ve been to 99 ranch for mostly Chinese/viet/Korean and H mart for Korean .  The meats were stocked and the sushi in the back looked pretty good - maybe I should have tried that one but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s different. 
They also have a little bakery with yummy desserts - I bought a cream bun, melon bun, and a apple one which were all good but not as good as tous les jour. 

Overall if you&#39;re shopping for Japanese groceries, makeup, baked goods and anything other than sushi go here.  If you want sushi go to tensuke."

I&#39;m honestly not all that impressed. I&#39;ve been here a handful or so amount of times now and the selection is just kinda meh. The produce is over priced compared to other places and it&#39;s not always as fresh as I think it could be. 

The meat is never well stocked (I always go on the weekends mid-day) and the one time I purchased pork it smelled like it had gone off so I chucked it in the bin. 

The products they do have are priced higher than I think they should be. (comparing them to hmart and the like. 

I think you should definitely visit Mitsuwa for all the shops that are inside, but the grocery store itself is rather dull and you&#39;d get a lot more for your money at Hmart."

Before the slight indoor remodel when there was an awesome toy/comic book store with Dance Dance Revolution outside of the door. 

Ahh, I love this place; it not only brings back memories every single time I go in, but it really is the first place I became slightly immersed in Japanese culture.

If you&#39;re going for the first time, it&#39;s easy to be overwhelmed.  Here is what you&#39;ll find depending on where you start:


Immediate left:

Bookstore with magazines, novels, manga, stationary and pens/erasers.  Note that there is really nothing with any English translation.

Liquor store:  Beer, wine, sake, and hard alcohol is available.


Around the corner on the left:

Cell phone store?  This may or may not still exist.  Rent space is known for being pricey, so some vendors don&#39;t last long.

Kitchen/stoneware store (where the comic/toy shop with the first DDR I&#39;d ever seen used to be, siiiigh): pretty stoneware, chopsticks, spoons... I&#39;d love some giant bowls from here for ramen, but can&#39;t justify $15+ apiece.

Video store: My ex-boyfriend&#39;s mom drives out here daily to get videos from the video store to supplement what she and her husband can&#39;t get on their satellite dish.  She&#39;s been doing that for decades.  I&#39;ve never ventured in, but I hope they continue to stay in business in order to service the aging (and not likely technically evolved nor inclined) Japanese residents who need that connection to home.


Middle when you first walk in:

Right now - massage chairs. Normally some beauty-related products such as cosmetics and specialty items.  Sometimes it&#39;s roped off for special performances or selling items for special events (i.e. plastic Sanrio/Anime character masks during the Bon Festival -- see below).


Middle/back:

Keep walking and to your left (across from cashiers/baggers), there is an open case with prepared sushi.  Keep walking and you get to the food court.

Food court: In all this time I&#39;ve only eaten at the food court once (ice cream) and the only other prepared food I&#39;ve had is ramen and yakitori at the annual Bon Festival when you can purchase food outdoors. 

The food court is cash only, by the way, so come prepared.  There&#39;s an ATM inside, though, if you aren&#39;t.


To your right:

Groceries and household:  There is a market with fresh produce and fish, frozen prepared foods, canned and dried/packaged goods, a candy/sweets section, and a wall of imported drinks. I appreciate that there are organic items trickling in, such as buckwheat noodles. 

You can also purchase rice cookers and other kitchen items, as well as bidets (bathroom).  Someday, mark my words, I will get myself one. (No judging unless you&#39;ve actually tried them!) :)

There is a bakery inside of the market place (to the right while facing the cash registers). I&#39;ve had limited success here.

My only gripe is that groceries can be a bit pricier here than another Japanese market in the area. I guess it only matters if you know what each marketplace carries and shop selectively based on that.


Other cool things:

The end-of-summer Bon Odori Festival - which is a Saturday in early August - is definitely something to check out! Aside from the food vendors, there is taiko drumming, adorable kiddos dressed up in kimonos, fishing and other games for the kids, and the bon song/dance that is performed by anyone/everyone who comes to the practices.  In the very least, it&#39;s just awesome people watching.


To sum, Mitsuwa marketplace is a way to experience a little Japanese culture without buying a plane ticket.  Native Japanese who do NOT live in Chicagoland actually travel on the weekends to come here... so realize how fortunate we are to have some Japanese markets in our area!"

A full Japanese grocery store, liquor store, book store and food court. The food court is amazing with a variety of mini restaurants featuring authentic Japanese dishes including some of the best ramen around.

The grocery is amazing and strange for non-Japanese visitors. Products range from giant blocks of sushi-grade salmon to squid jerky. You&#39;ll also find Japanese cleaning products, toiletries and more.

Even though most people don&#39;t think of Japan when it comes to baking, the little bakery is worth a visit. I also love the candy and snack section which has some crazy, inventive stuff.

Definitely not an upscale place by any means, the marketplace is, in fact, a Japanese grocery store complete with a food court and a bookstore. If you miss any type of Japanese food, this is the place to go! The pork and rice (Sutadon) was on point (i.e. pretty much what you&#39;d expect from Tokyo-based fast food). Additionally, the place offers a wide variety of other treats, such as boba, sushi, ramen and much more. Definitely not the cleanest or shiniest place in the world (the men&#39;s restroom is under construction and is currently a porta-potty), but the atmosphere is great and this is a sure culture hub that draws an incredibly diverse crowd from across Chicago."

There is a large variety of produce, meat and seafood along with sashimi grade sushi. The store has electronics and snack as well.

I recommend to start by having something to eat at one of the small restaurants. The food here is so good!Then go shopping, so you can get your walk and not overspend on an empty stomach. Finish at the bakery so you can have your desert.

You could find all kinds of imported groceries there, fresh fish flown overnight from Tokyo, imported Japanese knives, cheap soba noodles and some quality (and expensive) sake. I liked the store part much better than the food court as surprisingly you can find better Japanese food elsewhere around Chicago."

I don&#39;t get to come here much, so when I do it&#39;s like I&#39;m a kid in a candy store. Mituwa is one big property with a bunch of smaller ones inside it. The biggest section is a grocery store. There&#39;s also a bakery, a sushi grab-n-go stand, a sweets store, a bookstore, a video store, a cosmetics shop, and a food court. There&#39;s a stall for alcohol products as well.

The grocery store is the most fun, and the most interesting. It&#39;s full of so many products, both new and familiar. The produce and meats/fish are insanely fresh; the fish is shipped in overnight from Tokyo!

My greatest weakness in this store? The sweets. There&#39;s a huge assortment of cakes, candies, ice creams, and other sweet treats that makes me want to try them all. This past visit I walked away with quite a few treats for myself: kawaii Hello Kitty cookies, banana Pocky, matcha jelly-filled Hello Kitty marshmallows, a box of Hello Kitty moon pies, kiwi and strawberry mochis, a coconut fruit cup snack, a mango ramune soda, a matcha cake roll, a freeze dried chocolate and strawberry ice cream, a strawberry and chocolate Yan-Yan, to-go portions of honey, Hello Kitty soy sauce, a heart-shaped sushi mold, and a pair of sakura blossom chopsticks. Whew!

Oh yeah, I also got four flavors of ice cream: matcha, black sesame, red bean, and lychee. The matcha was my favorite- I recommend it!"

The market has a bunch of Asian things which I love. I got my hair bleach Palty from here. It has pretty much anything you could need whether it&#39;s food, treats, cosmetics, or gifts. and I love the little novelty store right by the entrance....although they are totally and completely overpriced. It&#39;s just nice to look through everything there. I also love the food court there, I really just wish there was a nicer area for sushi...everything is premade and there&#39;s really nothing special. Last time I went though, it was under construction so maybe my dream is coming true. I also heard there&#39;s a crepe area now? I&#39;ll have to check it out. The bakery inside the grocery store is also the best. The tastiest cutest little treats...yum!
Why do I give 4 stars instead of 5 then? A lot of things kind of look broke down that I&#39;d wish they would fix...I&#39;m pretty sure they do well enough, especially the tables and chair at the food court. Also the presentation of just about everything just looks cluttered and not aesthetically pleasing at all. Aesthetics are extremely important to me when grocery shopping since that&#39;s what makes me want to buy it. I kind of get flustered when shopping there because it&#39;s just so cluttered. Other than that, I would definitely at lease recommend that people check it out."

Prior to today I&#39;ve never been to Mitsuwa but have heard many good things about this Japanese-branded grocery store and more.  While our main goal today was to have lunch at the food court (ate lunch at Sutadonya and green tea ice cream at re Leaf - both yum), we also spent some quality time wandering through the main grocery store and a couple of the satellite stores surrounding it.  We each bought goodies from Pastry House Hippo (to be reviewed separately) - great selection of baked treats!

Anyway back to the main part of Mitsuwa, which is a nice-sized emporium selling Japanese and pan-Asian goods.  It is cool to just stroll down each aisle and stare at all the fun products, many of which are mainstream things in Japan but are quite hard to find here.  Look at all this stuff I have seen during my trips to Japan over the years - Pocari Sweat, Calbee snow pea crisps, Meiji sweet treats, numerous matcha-flavored goodies, and everything Hello Kitty (soy sauce, seaweed, everything!).  There are all kinds of fresh and frozen foods to check out, including an exotic selection of seafood flown in from the famed Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo.  If you feel like recreating the meals at home that you just ate at the food court, you can pretty much buy all the necessary ingredients here.  If you are lazy like I am, you can buy prepared foods to go such as packaged sushi (my bud says it&#39;s pretty good here) or perhaps even a &#34;Hamburg Bento&#34; box.  There are also colorful household wares including rice cookers, plastic containers, smiling sponges and back scratchers.  You never know what you might need until you see it on a shelf at Mitsuwa (I bought a tea kettle)."

They had roe (fish eggs) at a decent price and a whole selection of items you may purchase to make sushi like the pros. The guy behind the counter were prepping the fish and packing it. Such a skillful art. The meat selection was nice; I purchased some short ribs and waygu beef. The drinks were pricey but I was willing to pay $2 for a single serving bottle of juice as it was unique. 

The Pastry House Hippo sold the goods a la carte. You grab a tray and a tong, then fill the tray with the goodies. They are priced ranged between $1 to $3 an item. The items are bagged individually then you&#39;re good to go. 

After filling our cart, we walked up to the pink registers to ring up our items. The cashier seemed like she didn&#39;t want to be there but I didn&#39;t mind, I was eager to get to the food court. There was a whole section that was empty an I found that to be odd. They served Chinese, Japanese, and Korean style foods. Men in suits had ramen, families had meat with rice, Husband and I grabbed duck with rice and hargow (steamed translucent shrimp dumplings). It was magnificent to say the least. 

Last stop was at the book / stationary store. I spent the most time here. I purchased cute journals and pens. I absolutely loved it here. Mitsuwa is a great place to check out if you&#39;re in the area as there is something for everyone."

I&#39;ve gotten the sushi to go a number of times and have never been disappointed.  The place has a very strong Asian following and you&#39;ll see people drive all the way out from the city to go there.  My one complaint is that the little fast food shops inside the store are intimidating and if you don&#39;t know what you want before you show up I&#39;m not sure how to order it.  To date I still haven&#39;t.  Also know that they don&#39;t over prepare the sushi, that is to say they will run out so if you don&#39;t get the food to go by 5pm you best be prepared for slim pickings or to wait for one of the above mentioned shops to make it."

Similar to my feelings about the other locations, I think this grocery store/deli is a great place to immerse yourself in the culinary delights of Japan. I was so excited when I found out that I didn&#39;t have to go all the way to California to pay Mitsuwa a visit. This location is not as big as some of the ones I have been to on the West Coast, but it will give you your fix if you are in the mood for good Japanese food. 

There were two highlights during my most recent to Mitsuwa:

1. Salt ramen - pork ramen with a broth so rich you that you #canteven. The broth was very flavorful, bamboo shoots gave it a good tang, noodles had just the right bite to them, and the pork cheek was tender with just the right among of fat it....

2. Matcha green tea soft serve parfait with cake pieces and mochi bites = AMAZING. This dessert is not too sweet but has a great combination of flavors and textures that will seriously blow your mind after the first bite. I suggest sharing this with two or three other people. 

The only semi-weird experience I had at this location when I visited was that it was extremely hot in the dining area -- like so hot that I was sweating like I had just gotten out of an intense session of heat yoga. The ramen probably did not help me regulate  my body temperature but holy schmoly it was just super hot. Next time I will just leave my jacket in the car...TMI I know, but seriously, it felt like it was 100 degrees in there..and this was last week...when it was 20 degrees outside. 

Note about parking - the log is very big, so it should not be a problem at all. Go earlier in the day so you can have the freshest choices available when it comes to Ramen, rice bowls, and sushi."

I mean yes things are imported but if I were to compare the prices to the ones at Hmart- there is a visible difference. Which is why, the only thing that has me coming back to hmart is the food court.

If you&#39;re looking for a quick and yummy bite, I would recommend Mitsuwas food court.

Be aware, most of the businesses are cash only with an exceptional 2. 

The matcha cafe is heaven on earth for matcha lovers and the ramen with the salmon bowl is my absolute FAVE."

There&#39;s a little bit of everything here...a great grocery store packed with neat Japanese treats (it&#39;s definitely helpful to go with someone who has lived in Japan/speaks some Japanese if you want to have an idea of what a lot of the stuff is). I always have to get some Ramune while I&#39;m here (and some fun candy shh). The bakery within the grocery store is adorable and filled with a variety of treats, and there&#39;s a good amount of beauty/spa products and homewares throughout the aisles if you want a little something different. I&#39;m always tempted by the weird face masks, but I haven&#39;t gotten one yet. The food court is always packed, but you can usually snag a table if you&#39;re quick. I usually get donburi while I&#39;m here...I assume the ramen must be good because the line is always a hundred years long, but I&#39;m always too hungry by the time I get here to wait. 

There&#39;s also a book store filled with magazines, manga, plus plenty of fun plushies and stationery treats. I love that it&#39;s a one-stop-shop for a little fun day trip from the Milwaukee area...you can eat lunch and shop for a while without having to worry about going anywhere else."

I&#39;m lucky a friend lives in Arlington Heights because I&#39;m not sure we could justify the long trek here otherwise. We arrived about an hour and fifteen minutes before closing time. There were ready a bunch of places shut down, including the sushi bar, which didn&#39;t bother me at all because I hate raw fish. We noticed a long long at the Japanese ramen place, so we joined everyone. They must know where the good stuff is! Or maybe it was just one of the only places open, now that I think about it. 

It was cash only, so be prepared for that. Prices were good. We got a ton of food for a great price. My salt ramen came with rice and seaweed in a bowl (in two separate bowls). Each of us also got an egg with soy sauce, which tasted so good. My friend wasn&#39;t adventurous enough to even try the egg, so I was happy to eat two of them. This was the first time I have ever tried fresh ramen and it was very good. I&#39;m curious what other kinds of ramen available at Mitsuwa taste like. I&#39;ll be sure to try more in the future. There was bubble tea available at another kiosk, but I wasn&#39;t impressed by the banana with tapioca pearls. The pearls weren&#39;t cooked to perfection and there was more ice than fruit. Maybe they were running low on fruit because it was toward the end of the day, but I would have preferred just trying a different smoothie with more fresh fruit. 

We also explored the grocery store. There was a lot of variety of tons of Japanese brands I&#39;ve never heard of. I bought green tea mochi (a brand carried at many stores, so I know it&#39;s not necessarily the freshest), as well as fresh frozen mochi by a brand with lettering only in Japanese. That one was a winner! I sampled some of my gf&#39;s red bean paste bun from a bakery in there and it was probably my favorite thing. I look forward to coming back, probably on a weekend during the day many hours before closing, so I can experience more!"

You don&#39;t have to travel to Japan to experience it&#39;s culture - you can just drive on down the road and walk through the doors to eat and drink like you would if you were in the streets of Tokyo!  Long story short - it&#39;s  a pretty rad place especially if you like culturally diverse experiences.

In the market you can buy some fresh fruit and this fruit is huuugggeee!  Granted, it&#39;s a little expensive for this fruit but it&#39;s authentic as authentic can be.  And speaking of authenticity, their fish and all of the other produce looks just as amazing.  Not only can you shop for food items to go, but you can also wander into the food court, the alcoholic beverage section and the gift shop which has a copious amount of Japanese magazines, media and additional treasures.  I mean, seriously, this place has everything!  

In the food market they have plenty of different shops th at offer authentic entrees; they also have a bubble tea shop but you have to pay cash here.  I&#39;ll be honest and tell you that I&#39;m not sure if you have to pay cash at the other shops but I would come prepared just in case.  

Make sure go check it out, even if you&#39;re not planning on buying anything.  It&#39;s interesting just to see, though I do recommend maybe picking up some bubble tea or some of their food."

In fact, I think they&#39;re the only Japanese grocery store around. The store is big and has wide aisles, which is uncommon at most Asian grocery stores. They offer lots of free samples which is really great at a place like this where a lot of products may be unfamiliar. The layout of the store makes sense and the flow of shoppers is well-controlled.

They have a huge inventory. No matter what you&#39;re making you&#39;ll find the ingredients at Mitsuwa. I&#39;ve had a Japanese recipe for twenty years but only recently made it for the first time because I found burdock root at Mitsuwa. They have a great selection of sushi supplies for the amateur sushi chef we&#39;d all like to be. The fish is very good quality and perfectly portioned. 

The one negative thing I would say about the grocery area is that sometimes things have confusing labels. As most of you reading this review know, sometimes ingredients can have several different names depending on who&#39;s done the translation. There aren&#39;t many employees around to help you find things or explain, for example, that burdock root is also called &#34;gobo.&#34; 

The food court area has a wide selection of Asian delights. I can&#39;t comment on it though because I&#39;ve never eaten there. The line is always too long. It&#39;s my own fault for going at 1pm on a Saturday. I&#39;ll have to come back and go earlier. The bakery is great and I&#39;ve had several delicious cakes and pastries from it. I also really like the alcohol selection they have but, again, it would be nice if there were an attendant to help you find what you&#39;re looking for."

I arrived later in the evening so no takeout food for me. I will be back for another visit when I am driving through the area to stock up on Japanese cooking staples and to grab a bite to eat.

The best part of Mitsuwa is the food court - Daikichi sushi, Santouka ramen, bubble tea, and Pastry House Hippo.  We hardly broke a $20 and ate like kings!

I don&#39;t know much about the grocery offerings here, but the store is much nicer than Super H Mart.  It is much cleaner and brighter.

The security guard here looked like the dopey cop in &#34;Superbad.&#34;  He was giving us an evil side eye while I used the ATM, while I purchased sushi, and any other time we walked past him.  I was hoping to see him on the way out so I could ask him what the heck his problem was!"

I ate at the cafe several times with work colleagues or by myself. When alone, I enjoyed listening to the sound of Japanese speech, either on the TV or spoken by other customers eating here.

They put the leftover pieces of salmon, tuna or other fish left over on sale for lunch. Mitsuwa has the best prices I have seen for sashimi. I used to come here every Friday to get the salmon sashimi for myself and my puppy. 

I brought my brother here too when he visited Chicago from Kansas City. Both he and my sister-in-law loved the fresh baked goodies from their bakery. He found some really appealing stationary at the attached bookstore to take back home with him.

Honestly, I can buy everything in this place if I were financially capable.  Realistically, items here are quite expensive since lots of them are Japanese imports.  

They have the freshest seafood, sushi, and sashimi.  As many of you know, I&#39;m a seafood junkie, and I was hyperventilating as seeing those God&#39;s creations laying neatly in front of my eyesight.  

Everything you know about Japanese food, they will have it here.  It&#39;s funny to see SO many photos were posted on their yelp page, because the front entrance reminds patrons that there is no photos allowed.  I guess yelpers are yelpers; posting pictures is the name of the game.  

It&#39;s a large-scale Japanese-focused supermarket carrying full groceries.  You can utilize this place as your primary grocery store, but you will probably experience a high shrink in your wallet.  In other words, that is the reason why I have to render a half-star deduction because of the price point.  Otherwise, this place is just a god-sent if you love Japanese food that much.  

They have a pretty extensive snack department.  Once again, most of them were imported from Japan or other foreign countries.  This generates a higher retail price for those items.  I will have to consider them as luxury items in my opinion.  

Make sure you visit the bookstore.  They sell all the Japanese fashion magazines.  Wisely, they sealed those popular magazines so that you cannot read in store.  Nevertheless, if you choose to purchase, the vivi magazine, for instance, is $10.40 per edition.  As a result, I promptly put that magazine down and walked away immediately.  Very sad Rosa :(

I really, really love this place.  It&#39;s a must-visit place for anyone who likes to explore about Japan without jumping on a plane."

Dirty toilets make you wonder about the cleanliness of the place and how they take care of their food.  

My wife being Japanese, we have been going to Mitsuwa for the last 8 years living in Chicago.  We are happy they are around and like many of their products.  In fact, at times i find them better than Whole Foods (not much of a compliment given WF going down hill).

The best thing to do is order prior to picking up so you can grab &amp; go. I ordered right there in person and it was less than 10 minutes for my rolls to be made. They have a pretty big menu full of nigiri, maki rolls, tempura, interesting side dishes, noodle meals and some Korean meals like bibimbap! 

I was a bit hesitant but I&#39;m not sure what was causing my trepidation. I buy grab &amp; go sushi from Mitsuwa &amp; Tensuke all the time. Sushi To Go is closer to home for me so it makes a great alternative.

When I first walked in, I thought I might have made a mistake. There was a lady at the counter who didn&#39;t greet me, so I stood there awkwardly. She stood there awkwardly. I opened my trap to order and things were a bit less awkward after that. When she gave me my order, she was sweet &amp; nice so I&#39;m still a bit confused by the lack of communication at the beginning of our encounter.

My rolls were so filling that I had two for lunch and saved one to have with dinner. I found the proportions of rice to fish &amp; fillings to be completely as expected, they didn&#39;t skimp on the non-rice bits at all.
Break breakdown:
Crunch Roll $5.50 - No ingredients were listed for this roll but I knew I wanted to try it. It turned out being my favorite of the bunch and so much so I would venture back simply to have this roll. Chopped up tuna, spicy tuna style minus the spice, with some roe &amp; tempura crumbs that gave it that crunch.
Philadelphia Roll $5.90 - Standard Philly roll, no cucumbers which made me smile. My least favorite of the bunch, something in this usual-go-to-roll-for-me just wasn&#39;t doing it for moi.
Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll $6.99 - Biggest &amp; fanciest of the bunch with extra spicy mayo on top. If you&#39;re into spice, I think this will totally satisfy you. I&#39;m a weak sauce and my mouth was burning on fire. I went through a whole bottle of water just while downing this roll. That being said, I liked it! Fresh fish &amp; good delivery.

I&#39;m definitely coming back for that awesome crunch roll! Maybe two. I would love to try some of their other items, as well, including the bibimbap. I&#39;m intrigued!"

Today, while in a snow storm and waiting for an incoming train carrying precious cargo that needed to be picked up by none other than myself, I decided to break down and give it a go since I&#39;d already pretty much parked in front of the place and still had 30 minutes before the train got in. 

I walked in was greeted by a smiley young lady, eager to take my order. I only saw the giant menu behind the register and didn&#39;t realize that there was a second menu to my right with other specialty rolls that I&#39;ll be sure take part in next time. So anyway, because I only saw about half the menu, I got a pretty basic blend of rolls that were done really well, though at first glance I thought I&#39;d be disappointed by the amount of rice vs fish in each roll, but the flavor translated differently than I&#39;d played it out in my head and it was really something. 

The spicy tuna and spicy salmon were actually spicy, and I liked that it didn&#39;t taste overwhelmingly like mayo. The vegetable roll was decent and a nice variety of different vegetables, and wasn&#39;t just a California roll sans the crab and the avocado roll was sent from the gods. It was simple, but unbelievably creamy- above and beyond any other avocado roll I&#39;ve ever had. 

The sushi was all budget friendly and the four rolls I ordered were just enough food for two people to enjoy for dinner, yet not be so stuffed that they blow their chunks when they follow up their sushi dinner with a hearty helping of cardio brought to them by the Insanity workout system and all in all it cost me $22 (that includes a tip) and only about 12 minutes. It&#39;s not the most artistic or high-end sushi, but for a carry-out sushi location it gets the job done and it does it pretty darn well."

Shrimp tempura rolls are awesome, spicy tuna rolls are another one of my favorites,  definitely recommend the Dancing Eel roll, which is a shrimp tempura , eel, masago, avocado, eel sauce and spicy mayo.

Hell, as long as it&#39;s done by a pro sushi chef, I&#39;ll eat it!

We had tickets for a show at Durty Nellie&#39;s (right across the street) and upon peeping a line wrapped around the block, we decided to kill some time at Sushi To Go. Although the entire menu sounded amazing, we stuck with the basics and ordered a spicy tuna roll and a spicy salmon roll. It cost us just under $10, which we were super excited about. Since we didn&#39;t call in our order, we were told it would take about 10 minutes. No problem -- sushi is worth waiting for.

Once our food was done and packed up so nicely, we headed back to our car to dine. The previous reviews are right- this is strictly to go with not even a single table to eat. It&#39;s a good thing because it makes your sushi fix cheap, but it may lead to you dining in your car. Hey, there&#39;s a first time for everything!

The rolls were very generously sized for the $4.70 price tag. We got six pieces of each, but they were humongous in comparison to other spicy tuna/salmons that I&#39;ve had. Taste wise, I preferred the tuna to the salmon. They were both good, but I wouldn&#39;t say &#39;amazing&#39; if that makes sense.  Next time, I&#39;ll try one of the specialty rolls too because there was a huge variety and they all sounded delicious.

I can&#39;t recommend this place enough--especially if you&#39;re a sushi addict who happens to find yourself in the area. Even if you find yourself using chopsticks to mix your soy sauce and wasabi in a car, you can&#39;t deny the fact that it was all worth it."

We constantly visit Sushi Asahi in Palatine, Oba Contemporary Sushi in Mt. Prospect and Bistro Wasabi in Hoffman Estates so we have had our fair share of Premium Sushi out here in the burbs.

Please be aware that this is not a sit down place, they only do take out, which I agree is a great idea for their location.  

The Pros:  Very convenient for pickup on the way home from work. Parking is easy, Prices are not cheap, but low for sushi standards, menu variety was very good.  And the staff I spoke with was very professional and friendly. Placing the order over the phone was easy and my food only took about 15 minutes and we ordered about 7 various items off the menu.

The Bad: Unfortunately the sushi was mediocre. Not that it was spoiled or anything, just nothing special.  Very small amounts of tuna in the spicy tuna rolls and the shrimp in the rolls did have a slight funny taste to it.  Also the food appeared to be put together rather hastily, presentation was pretty much the worst I have ever seen and any sushi place.  Not even close to the photos they show on the site.

We ordered 2 Spicy Tuna rolls, California roll, jalapeno appetizer, miso soup
Halloween Maki and a Tiger Roll, and somthing else I forgot.

That&#39;s about it for my Review, will I be heading back here?  Sorry to say I won&#39;t, unfortunately it was still a $55.00+ dinner for 3 adults and two children, and that&#39;s a pricey mistake I won&#39;t repeat. 

I was hoping for a option of sushi that wouldn&#39;t hit the wallet as hard, but the lowering of the quality seriously outweighed any 10-30 percent cost benefit of Sushi To Go.   

Honestly, get the $25.00 coupon off Restaurant.com website for Asahi and the prices are about equal anyway."

The sushi is decent. I can&#39;t say that it&#39;s the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had but it&#39;s CERTAINLY do-able and it hit the spot (after a long sushi craving too!). I can&#39;t say that it&#39;s a hole-in-the wall because it&#39;s in a little strip mall next to a movie theater and a spa and I&#39;ve definitely seen a lot of hole-in-wall-type restaurants and it&#39;s far from that. 

There&#39;s no chairs. Just simply a counter, a menu, and some employees. The fish was fresh and I ordered 6 different rolls ranging from 3.99 to 9.00 and it only came out to $41 with taxes. LOVE IT! They have some specialty rolls that you&#39;d normally pay $14.00 for at a restaurant and only charge you $8-$9.00 (like a dragon roll).

Lemon water was lemon-less. The salad had only the smallest bit of Caesar dressing so not sure what it was supposed to be. Their idea of unlimited shrimp is to avoid your table until you leave in frustration so you can&#39;t put in an order. 

I&#39;ve been to other Outbacks and this by far is the worst. Our so-called server spent more time avoiding our table than anything I&#39;ve ever seen.

Came in on a Thursday afternoon and there was no hostess working. We were seated about 5 minutes after arriving by our soon to be waiter. Noticed the leftover food from the tops of tables were brushed onto the booth chairs and dirty coasters were left sitting around.

Food was tasty, but took quite some time to come out. I ordered the Outback Sirloin 6oz steak special with garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. My potatoes were served cold. 

It seemed like our waiter had too many tables for his experience. I also noticed a seed in my water cup when I never asked for a lemon.. our waiter said that everything is close in proximity so it must&#39;ve &#34;just fell in.&#34; But this is a no-no because I could have choked on the seed through my straw had I not seen it at the bottom of my cup or what if I had been allergic to lemons, that would have been a lawsuit waiting to happen."

The free bread and butter was a nice touch! :-)

If I hadn&#39;t had that, I&#39;d walk away hungry.

Oooey gooey cheese with bacon, mushrooms and chicken- frankly how can that be wrong?!

Waiter- attentive, polite- no complaints until the end of the meal when he stepped away too long to check out the Bears preseason game and took his time bringing our check.  My friends had steaks and made point to say it isn&#39;t like what it used to be.  

My meal was a big disappointment.  I ordered an outback special medium with mashed.  The mashed were so salty I could only mange to swallow a third.  The steak- well how do I say....from the second they put it in front of me, it just didn&#39;t look  right.  Pale is the best descriptor.  The steak was so salty - I could barely eat but it was also not MEDIUM, was closer to full on rare. Friend said her baked potato was &#34;off&#34; dry- probably sitting too long.  My other friend said great sweet potato fries.

My friend was the unlucky recipient of salad dressing on his leg as the waitress from the table across from us dropped that table&#39;s salad and the dressing went flying over by us.    Accidents happen and normally would not take note to mention-I DO MENTION because the woman that dropped it  was compromised, either very high or very tired.  I had mentioned to my friends twice (prior to the drop) that she was out of it and they agreed.  So-no forgiveness for this specific accident.   

Shortly after the accident, the manager, slender curly haired young woman who looked barely out of high school.  came by and apologized for the salad dressing and said his meal was gratis.  Ok- that is fine and the appropriate thing to do, but my meal coupled with everything else warrants this a a 1 star merely for the Chix app and the waiter, at the start anyway.  

The free meal and an $8 coupon still didn&#39;t make up for this bad experience.  Longhorn in Rosemont puts this place to shame!

They upgraded the butter, it is now nice and fluffy :)

The Steak I got was cooked spot on and the broccoli I got was the perfect tenderness where you get the snap and great color and flavor.

The Buffalo Shrimp tastes like Buffalo.

The Shrimp Scamp is tender and tastes good.

The Crispy shrimp is crisp and tartar is good.  I found out later on that they made the   tartar special each time we asked for it.  It was very good!  Just the right balance!

Few general notes: 
There are no shells and no tails with the shrimp
You get about 7 shrimp each time you order. 
You can order as soon as you get a set.
The wait is generally ok, depending on how busy they are at that particular moment.

The event offered free items from the new bar menu (basically finger food/small plates/appetizers.) Unfortunately, my boyfriend/+1/guest cannot consume food with gluten and these bar menu items all had gluten in them, so I asked one of our servers, also the manager, if he could bring us a gluten free menu. My bf ordered shrimp and the manager, Manny, said it was on the house. Later, he even brought out ahi tuna that was so delicious and didn&#39;t charge us for that, either. I partially think the employees really wanted good reviews from us, especially because we are yelp elites, but I also believe Manny is just great with customer service. He was exceptionally helpful, generous, and accommodating. 

So now, my review for the items we paid for or were willing to pay for that were not part of the yelp event. 

My bf ordered a gold coast margarita. Came in a mason jar (yeah, maybe it&#39;s kinda hipsterish, but I kinda like it, so whatev) and had a salt rim. We have been to places that do not include the salt rim, even at times when we asked for it! Gotta have that salt rim on your margarita. It was pretty good. I ordered a peach strawberry sangria and it was also really good. I asked for easy ice because I didn&#39;t want it to be watered down, but I slurped it down so fast, I guess it didn&#39;t really matter. Like I said, the ahi tuna was so good. It is raw and encrusted in salt &amp; pepper. Comes with two sauces: wasabi &amp; ginger (I&#39;m pretty sure). I liked both a lot, but liked the wasabi sauce better. For dessert, we shared a gluten free brownie sundae. Hoooo-my-gosh. So delish. Brownie was warm (which is basically a make or break for me.) Only turn off was that the sundae looked like it had been sitting awhile in back before it was brought out because it looked all melted, but we didn&#39;t care because it tasted so friggen good! We scarfed it down immediately and left practically nothing on the plate. 

Just a note that this review is mostly for the food. I don&#39;t really want to rate the service, even though Manny was great, because I feel it was biased. Our servers were for this event only, so of course we were served in a timely fashion. There was a limited number of attendees and everyone was served the same things at the same time.

Forgot to mention the drink prices were more than fair. For some reason, I expected the prices to be higher, but drinks were only about $5.50. They have a $4 drink menu as well. Food prices are what I expected for this type of restaurant. 

While most of our food was fried and/or unhealthy, it was delicious and I would definitely return sometime."

Re: A family of five is asked to leave Outback restaurant in Buffalo Grove, IL and told not to come back!
We ordered the minute we sat down while informing the server that our 2 year-old and teenagers were in a rush to eat. After waiting 40 minutes for salads, we asked to speak to a manager. Our food came out after 50 minutes of waiting, as did the manager. 
First, she defended the kitchen by presenting a timeline that was nowhere near accurate (off by 30 minutes). Then, she chose to attack my husband for having a similar issue a few weeks back. After I informed her that each time we eat at this Outback, we promise each other we will never come back, she insulted us again by questioning why we didn&#39;t inform our server that we were in a rush... The problem is that we did- from the start, and several times after. 
The final straw was when she &#34;dismissed&#34; us and informed us that we were not welcome back. Not only had we not eaten our meals, but we were giving feedback that was meant to be constructive. This store (and chain) has lost our business, and our respect.
Where is the professionalism? Where are the customer relations skills? Customers should come first. I operate that way in my own career. I travel for business, and I&#39;m disappointed to experience that with this chain, this philosophy is non-existent. In a totally separate incident in another city, I had a server who inflated our bill, not just for us, but for several customers...
The cost of this meal pales in comparison to the overall experience and disappointment we feel as well-paying customers. Unbelievable!"

We often go to the Buffalo Grove Outback (Dundee rd)  with very good overall experiences in the past.  We stopped at the Golf rd location because it was closer on our way home from Elk Grove.  What a mistake, We will never come back to this establishment again.

Walked in, parking was tough, door nowhere near any of the spots, but acceptable.  Interior redesign was nice, unlike any Outback I had been in before, clean and fresh.  We were seated quickly and had a very nice server named Rocky come over quickly.

We pretty much knew what we wanted, ordered the Bloomin onion right away.  About 10 minutes later placed our food order.  Our salads came out, we asked for the Onion, we were told that is was coming and sorry for the wait.  Then it came out and our server said he was sorry again and we would be comped the onion.  This was acceptable to us, it&#39;s OK, everyone has a bad day sometimes. The onion was good, but overall a bit greasier that we are used to.

Then our meals came out, my wife did the outback special and I did the outback special with the all you can eat shrimp.   Kids ate bread and shared a chicken fingers kids meal (was acceptable)  My wife&#39;s steak was ordered medium well and it was cooked right, but honestly it just wasn&#39;t very tasty in general, not bad enough to complain about, but just OK.  

My steak was ordered medium Rare and it was medium well (barely any pink at all).

I politely told Rocky and he took it from me and apologized again, then telling us that this kind of this happens all the time lately.  Not very professional, but then again this is the kitchens fault, not his. But he probably shouldn&#39;t tell the patrons that.

So another ten minutes later I get my new Steak and potato, brought out by the Female manager (didn&#39;t catch her name), this time it was DELICIOUS.  Not even the same cut as the first one, this was juicy and red in the middle as I asked for.  This one was 10x better than my wife&#39;s steak or my first one, which was now eaten after all the waiting (we did have to get the kids home to bed at this point). How could this one be so different than our first two?  The Manager also asked me if I&#39;d like more shrimp, I said yes please, she said they would be right out, and she apologized to us as well for the mistakes that were made.

Now everyone in our group is done eating, waiting for me to finish because of all the delays.  we ask for a togo box and figure I&#39;d just take the shrimp home with me.  waiting.. waiting..  And I see a server come out with shrimp and give them to the table behind us.  then Rocky comes over, says he&#39;s sorry again and that someone messed up and gave away my shrimp. Then I tell him I have waited this long (and now I an determined to get them because of the principle).  My wife now goes and gets the kids into the car and I am waiting inside by myself.

He puts in another order and tells me he brought it up to manager and she just sighed in disappointment to him.  Considering she placed the order, I would think they would get that one right?  Or at least come back out and talk to me about it?

7-8 minutes later he brings them out to me in a Togo container and I head out to the car.  When I got home I opened it and looked at literally 6-7 small fried shrimp in a small Styrofoam container.. Really?  What a disappointment.

It would seem to me that there is a serious lack of communication between the waiters/servers managers and cook staff here.  The manager really needed to come out and address me again after her cooks and then her clearly made several easily avoidable mistakes.  We even mentioned our problems to the folks at the table next to us and they said the service is always hit or miss, and they were getting part of their meal comped as well.

I did like our waiter, we was polite and attentive to our needs and I liked the atmosphere, but that&#39;s it.  I guess we have been spoiled by all the staff in Buffalo Grove.  If this was the only Outback I had ever gone to, I would never be coming back for sure..  And I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT be coming back to this location."

The food was decent, but I think the quality of the product is falling so fast downhill there&#39;s no stopping it anymore....

We needed to coordinate my birthday dinner around 7 and 5 year olds so dinner at 6pm on a Friday night was not an option.   

Outback does not take reservations but here&#39;s a tip: when you call ahead, people will accomodate you to the best of their ability so don&#39;t wait until the last minute!

My Sister spoke with someone on Wednesday. We were assured that if there were a line of people by the time we arrived, our name would be at the top of the list regardless of who got there first. It was like being on the guest list at a club downtown. It was awesome! The downside, they knew it was my birthday (read on)!

I love their food. I appreciate the value of it. I like that my NY strip steak comes with inclusions (soup or salad and a side) as well as optional additions (my fave: sauteed mushrooms. My opinion: it tastes better than the ones served at Ruth Chris). 

Beware, come hungry. It&#39;s hard not to fill up on the deliciously warm brown bread served while you wait. You can even ask for more!

Josh our server was kid friendly, patient and attentive. He used a flashlight ap on his phone to help us find a toy that fell under the table. He also came back later to embarass me when he and some other staff members serenaded brithday wishes to me with dessert in tow!"

Although we came in late on a Saturday night, our server, Frankie treated us well.  He was super attentive, on top of my diet-coke guzzling hubby and even topped off the night with a (song-less) birthday dessert.  

I was disappointed to have missed Frankie serenading my hubby, but when my father-in-law (who only treats when it is Old Country Buffet) footed the bill, I could tell Frankie made an impression. ----Although he did leave two cents for a tip...but, that is just how he rolls...depression-style!

Don&#39;t worry, we took care of Frankie&#39;s tip just as well as he treated us and we even came back one week later just to say hi.  (Oh, and have a steak, too.)

The food was pretty good, the decorating, not so much.

UPDATE:

Since my last review, they have done some much needed remodeling work.  I like what they have done with the space. It looks cleaner and much more upscale.  The lighting is also very forgiving.  

This time our server&#39;s name was Monica. She was extremely attentive to detail. Our order came out wrong, but she covered herself well. Her smile was so genuine and infectious it was hard to hold anything against her!  Kudos, to good service and a great attitude, Monica.

We all ordered the $11.99 Lunch Special which featured soup or salad, 3 choices of entree--we all chose the 6 oz. sirloin, different choices of potatoes and cheesecake for dessert.

The soup or salad, choice of potato and cheesecake dessert were all excellent.
The steaks were DRY.  We ordered them medium.  We&#34; sawed&#34; rather than cut them.

When my food came I asked for cheese for my potato, napkins and some other stuff. He said he&#39;d be right back, he then went to a table next to us and took their whole order, was there for about 4 min, and took about 8 to come back with my cheese. By that time my potato was eaten.. My salad was absolutely terrible. The server never checked back on our table.. Finally came to see if we needed boxes, 3 of us said yes, he came back with 2, and rudely said &#34;o did u want one too&#34; came back with a 3rd..

His martini was mediocre.  I don&#39;t know how they can call themselves a steakhouse when there are numerous restaurants that do it much better -- albeit more expensive.  If you don&#39;t want to pay an arm and a leg for prime meat cooked perfectly and all the sides/drinks done right, then fire up the grill and cook a Jewel filet.  It will be better than the Outback.  

Two good points.  Their wines were quite moderately priced and the desserts were too and just the right serving size (not too big)."

I visit this place the way some people like to go to a fast-food joint.  I visit this location 3-4 times a month.  The way some people eat hamburgers and french fries, I eat steak and seafood.  LOVE IT.

I decided to review this Outback because it is finally serving their snow crab legs again!  Last year I was bummed to see them disappear off the menu, only to find out that they have them seasonally.  And here they are again!  Do I consider this place fine dining - absolutely NOT.  However, if you&#39;re looking for a place to eat decent food, this is a good place to go, whether you&#39;re going out with friends for a bite and a drink, or with your significant other because you just don&#39;t feel like cooking, you&#39;ll always find something here to eat.  I don&#39;t come here for the service, though it&#39;s not horrible.

Also, the fact that they came up with a more cost effective menu entices even more now because you can get a bit more bang for your buck, as well as a revolving variety while the menu changes.  Enjoy!"

Out waiter was too chummy with a large party and eventually brought our bacon in a cup, after we had eaten half the fries.  Strike two - I ordered the victoria filet and it came out grey with a side of fat.  That was not worth $18.  Sent it back and they apologized and brought me another with char and some fat. Still not happy but I got another sweet potato $10 off and a free dessert.  So that was nice.  About the sweet potato dripping in butter and cinnamon sugar (yum) put it in a small dish.

The shrimp ceviche tasted better after a couple of days when refrigerated...wish the shrimp could have been bigger but that&#39;s not a deal breaker for me.
Will definitely come back and try their other fares. I was just wondering why they didn&#39;t give us spoons and forks? Eating with your hands may be the best way to go... :)

We order a huachinango en mojo de ajo, a coctel de camarones, camarones a la diabla and two tacos for my daughter...

The atrium here is the coolest in the area for sure. 

My party did hibachi dinners and all you can eat sushi and was pleasantly surprised by most of it. 

In the area the competition is House of Tokyo in St Charles and Ju Rin in South Elgin (and Geneva) and it holds its own very well. 

The hibachi here is the best of the three. The portions are generous and the hibachi shrimp was fantastic. 

The sushi quality was on par with House of Tokyo but not as good as Ju Rin. The redeeming quality that will bring me back is the all you can eat sushi. Ju Rin doesn&#39;t do AYCE."

They should probably update their wording with Groupon, nonetheless we were not upset by it and even figured that would be the case.

Anywho... double date night at Tokyo Steakhouse II and we went in with mixed feelings due to reviews.  Did we figure the hibachi presentation would be the same? Yes, its like that EVERYWHERE.  Even if you go to the freaking Caribbean, I am not kidding.  We were super pumped for the food?  Eh, kind of.  Were we surprised? Yes.

You get a ton of food for the money.  Soup, Salad, Rice, Noodles, Veggies, Shrimp Appetizer, your main dish and ice cream.  Everything was really good.  Plus, our chef asked us if we wanted to try the Spicy Garlic topping.  GET THIS.  I had it added to my shrimp and it was amazing.  Then, every 10 minutes or so he would ask if we wanted Sake shots through a squeeze bottle.  I only did it once cause somebody had to drive home.  I am pretty sure it was watered down, but I can&#39;t complain about free shots.  

The one setback?  They were not the greatest about serving drinks, whether it was booze or just water.  They were pretty slow and you had to hunt them down for a refill.

It is an expensive night out, so the groupon helped a lot."

The vegetables were cooked just the way I like them, crisp and the right amount of tender.

It&#39;s tasty but i can&#39;t eat it often. Maybe once/twice a year. Everyone likes watching the chef cook with flair and toss the raw egg around. It is entertaining until the chef gets overlyfriendly with the ladies at the table and get overly squirt happy with the water bottle and sake bottle. I don&#39;t want water thanks and old water from that bottle sitting who knows how long is now on my food... Ick... I didn&#39;t appreciate that much. It sent the whole table on edge making the rest of the dinner stressful... I am sure it was meant to be fun but clearly we all said no squirting! We won&#39;t be back nor with the people we went with return. Honestly we alll found it disrespectful to flirt and compliment all the mens wives. The men were angry and the women thought it was creepy. Disappointing and ruined the evening for the whole table. Bummer.

Well if you&#39;ve never been to a hibachi chef chump show, your first time experience will pretty much be the same as the second, third, and kajillionth time. It&#39;s possible that there&#39;s only one samurai chef school where all these iron chefs are birthed from. So you see one, you&#39;ve seen them all. Yes, I speak of the the black belt demonstration of chopping the veggies, the Thomas the Train choo choo onion tower smoke show, the burn your eyelashes and eyebrows fire show, and the infamous catch a food item from the grill to the patrons mouths! 

I ordered the shrimp and scallop dinner. Halfway down to finishing my plate, I felt like I was eating an overpriced and upscale Panda Express. My plate consisted of noodles, fried rice ($1.95 extra), veggies, shrimp, and scallops. I can honestly say that the quality and taste were just ok. I think half of the price of my food was the presentation. I do appreciate the fresh ingredients and that my food was made in front of me--- this means no hanky panky! Service--- it was bare. I think all the service was focused on the showmanship and no regard to other service but. Bleh. 

The dinner plate came with salad (probably the best ginger dressing salad I&#39;ve ever had), miso soup (with tempura flakes and mushroom), and choice of vanilla/chocolate/strawberry ice cream. 

So if you&#39;re looking for a food show, check it out! If you&#39;re looking for great food, don&#39;t.

They also have hibachi  which can be served traditional style around the grill or you can just get it served in the dinning room, which I thought it was nice to have the choice.  We got there around 6:30 on a Tuesday and it was not crowded at all maybe 5 cars in the parking lot.  That being said the service was incredibly slow.  We waited a good 15 minutes before even getting our drink order placed.  Also the hibachi orders where done way before the sushi was and instead of timing it they brought out the hibachi right away so half my party was eating while the other half could only watch, unless you order an appetizer, oh wait those took forever too, and it was only edamame and vegetable tempura.  Also if you decide to go with the all you can eat sushi their menu is not very clear and does not tell you how many pieces come in each roll which would be helpful when ordering especially if they are going to charge you for anything you don&#39;t finish.  The waiter tried to be helpful but was new so still did not explain the potion sizes correctly, but the sushi was actually pretty good.  The hibachi comes with ice cream, i would pass because there was so much freezer burn on it was not worth eating.  One more thing if you use the 20% off coupon on their website you cannot use this if you want to split the check, well you can but it will only be applied to one bill, it also cannot be used towards the all you can eat sushi, and to top it off when the waiter brought us the bill he patiently waited right at our table for us to fill in the tip....awkward!!!"

The takeout can be good as well.  The problem I had was the one time I went in for pick up, they delivered my order to someone.  They then asked if I wanted them to deliver the order.  Their plan was to create the order for the first person, deliver that.  Pick up my order from their house and deliver it.  I said no way.  I don&#39;t want food that has been opened by someone who did not order it and then have it delivered. They recreated my order, and I had to wait 20 minutes.

A great hibachi place with delicious sushi options. Apparently this place will give Benihana a run for its money.

Decor:
This place is definitely clean and well organized.  All hibachi grills are evenly placed in the room.  There are two separate dining areas.  One side has mainly hibachi and the other has the hibachi.  A good amit of energy in the atmosphere. 

Service:
Very good with polite waitresses and entertaining chefs.  Everything was hot and on time.  Can&#39;t really complain about this aspect of this place. 

Food:
Food was absolutely delicious! I had the chicken with noodles, steamed rice, cooked vegetables, and 6 sushi rolls.  Definitely more than enough food for one person.  It was flavorful especially with the sauces they provide you with.  I took a bite of a friends steak and it was absolutely delicious.

Price:
Price was pretty good for what we got.  For everything I paid about 21.95.  Not bad at all.

Overall:
A good quality meal with excellent service and decent price.  Definitely give this pace a try."

Service:
They had really good customer service; the chef was entertaining and super friendly, and the waiter checked on us many times. 

Food:
Their hebachi is pretty good, but a bit salty probably from all the soy sauce. You can probably ask to adjust that. Their filet mignon was perfect, but it was tiny (about 4oz). 

My husband also ordered their California roll, shrimp tampura, and avocado rolls. Their quality was okay for their price.

Ambience:
Cute restaurant. Seems clean. Spacious.

I haven&#39;t tried anything else off of their menu, and I have not dined in the restaurant. We are loyal customers of TL Four Seasons in downtown Bartlett. We order takeout sushi from them monthly. My only problem with TLs is that their sushi selection is very &#34;vanilla&#34; They don&#39;t have any super creative rolls, nor is their sushi menu very big.... It was a Friday night and we wanted to try a different place, but we were really craving sushi, so we gave Tokyo a try. 

I feel bad saying this, but I think I like the sushi better at Tokyo then TLs... Their variety is awesome and everything is creative and fresh. Their staple rolls are very good. Spicy tuna, spicy scallop, tuna avocado, etc. All very delicious and fresh. They also have funky rolls for the more adventurous type, and all of them were great. 

Additional perks - if you order online they give you 15% off of your order. TOTALLY AWESOME. Only downfall, they don&#39;t deliver... I definitely would&#39;ve given this place a 5 out of 5 if they delivered, but unfortunately they don&#39;t offer that option.

1.  Arrived at 6:30PM, seated at 7:20PM, served water at 7:50PM and dinner over at 8:50PM.

2. Groupon stated $16 for two Hibachi entrees ($30 value) restaurant said that meant $30 off the bill.  Not cool but didn&#39;t argue.

3.  The entire meal was cooked in reverse order from Benihana, Japan 77, Kampai or any other Hibachi Steakhouse I&#39;ve visited.  The fried rice was made first, then some greasy noodle dish that was inedible, then the vegetables, then the entrees and finally the Hibachi Shrimp Appetizer which is exactly two medium-ish shrimp per person.

4. The Miso soup was so bland I&#39;m not even sure it contained Miso.  It may have just been brown water with some flakes on top, no tofu, no seaweed.  

5.  The salad was fresh, and crisp however, the dressing tasted like a watered-down spicy ranch and it was one of the better tasting items.

6.  The sauce tray had three spots for sauce.  They filled two of the spots, one was definitely the watered-down spicy ranch dressing again and the other was a reddish ginger sauce that had the consistency of diluted jam.  Where was the hot mustard sauce?

7.  The Tuna Tataki was beyond bland and hard, as if it had been sitting out a long time. It was served with soy sauce but no wasabi.  Another guest ordered a maki roll and that had wasabi on the side.  Why doesn&#39;t the tuna come with wasabi?  I did not bother to ask since our server seemed to run in and out of the dining room without stopping at our table.

8.  The filet mignon I ordered rare was tender and tasted okay but then I had to get home in a hurry.  I think they used a lot of meat tenderizer since that is the reaction my body has to meat tenderizer.

9.  Hibachi dinners come with ice cream, the chocolate ice cream was so un-chocolate tasting I again wondered did they take ice cream and water it down?

I would be surprised if this restaurant is open in a year but if it is they should be selling water.  I will not go back."

I&#39;ve talked about the Hibachi and how addictive the appetizer noodles are (Very.). 

We&#39;ve gone a few times for the All you can Eat Sushi.

You can choose whatever you want ( while there is a total limit on sashimi, which makes sense) However, you&#39;re charged for whatever you don&#39;t eat.  Is that an issue to me? No. Just order small amounts, and then order more if you&#39;re still hungry. It&#39;s great because this way they don&#39;t have people ordering a ton of food that they won&#39;t eat - which is a total waste of food. 

And, i&#39;m gonna say it: I think this place has better food than T.L.s. 
Yeah.

Mexico Fire (Fried jalapeno? Hell yeah)

Prior to opening I was excited because Bartlett doesn&#39;t have a habachi restaurant.  Needless to say because I came alone I was not going to be able to enjoy the show of their chef skills,  they completely turned me away!  


I was shocked.  The place was empty as is - What restaurant opening week turns someone away from seeing what they offer.  Basically they offered me a seat away from the chef table where they&#39;d being me food from the kitchen- or I can get take out.  


Literally if I was able to give 0 stars I would.  So I called the management and was told that night and was told that&#39;s how they handle people that come alone. 


So no I have not tried their food - and truthfully I won&#39;t be trying it.  If this is a way a business treats someone coming to experience them - I don&#39;t care if they are alone or of a party of 50 service should be the same.

For dinner, I had the filet &amp; scallops ( filet was fatty, some pieces, unchewable)
My husband had the lobster &amp; filet ( lobster was over cooked)

A Japanese restaurant taking over what used to be a Greek diner. The atmosphere feels like it&#39;s stuck in a time warp between the Buddha statue and the ceiling that&#39;s painted like the sky. 

We had a groupon that was for four people and a $60 value. There were only two of us, so that led to a conversation with the hostess. She told us if we wanted to use it, we had to spend $100. Well, that wasn&#39;t going to take a whole lot. Mom got a mojito, which she wasn&#39;t crazy about. Why a Japanese restaurant is serving mojitos, I&#39;m not really sure. I had a large Sapporo, which was really satisfying. We started with six pot stickers, which were fine. We had those and a cup of Miso soup. The chef arrived before our salads were even out. That&#39;s just bad timing on their part. We had to hurry to eat the salads just to be ready for our dinner.

The filet mignon and shrimp were tremendous. Juicy steak and flavorful shrimp. The fried rice was great, although I really didn&#39;t need the noodles since I already had rice. The veggies were fine, a little bit undercooked, but that&#39;s certainly better than overdoing them. The chef was really cool too. First he flipped broccoli into my mouth. Then, he had a squirt bottle of sake and he gave me two shots. Very cool touch. they did give us some ice cream, which was a nice finish. Mom got the dancing eel sushi to go and she seemed to enjoy it. I&#39;m not about to give a sushi review; I don&#39;t touch the stuff. Ever since that bad experience in Mexico...

Anyway, this is a fine Hibachi experience. They could use a little help with the ambience as well as the timing. I&#39;d go back, but I&#39;d want to have a groupon with me."

We really enjoyed it a lot. The meats were very tender and tasty. They use this spiced butter or something as their seasoning for everything, including the noodles and rice. I really hope it&#39;s not margarine or anything like that. I&#39;ll have to ask. My little 5 year old also really enjoyed it and wants to go for her birthday lol. We went on a Saturday night and had no issues with seating or service. I hear that the prices are very good compared to other hibachi restaurants."

We got sat down at our Hibachi table at 8:30 after a couple of grande sapporo&#39;s at the bar . One was on the house , thanks to the super cool bartender (young lady) . Hung out at our hibachi table for about 1/2 hour longer until  9:00pm when one of three hibachi chef&#39;s on a Saturday night showed up and finally began to cook us a fabulous filet dinner . We have been to Tokyo 4 times . They have one good Asian chef , I believe his name is Aaron , he&#39;s a big , younger , guy . He throws food into your mouth along with squirting Sake . He makes it fun and gets the patrons involved . The particular chef we had that night cooked our food to perfection but gave a nice scoop of our filet to a little girl sitting at our table that had ordered chicken. No , it wasn&#39;t a mistake .

We went there on a Groupon that clearly stated $16 for a hibachi dinner for two. After enjoying our about you dinner for two we were hit up with an additional $31 in charges and told that the Groupon is only $30 off of our meal. Groupon of course stood behind it but the management of the restaurant argued and argued telling me that that&#39;s not what I&#39;m reading with my own eyes.  Go to Benihana&#39;s it&#39;s a much better experience It also feels like you&#39;re sitting in the kindergarten room with the hundreds and hundreds of pictures of previous diners on every wall possible.

It was very expensive however.  But, you can often find coupons on-line or in mailers.  They accepted an on-line coupon for 25% off when I Google Tokyo Steakhouse II coupons in images and found one.  Made the meal that much sweater.  Had enough food to take home for another day. I got the filet.  Was not sure how it would reheat, and was in a hurry the next day.  I used the microwave expecting the meat to be tough, but to my present surprise, it was still tender and flavorful.  So with the coupon and getting 2 meals for the price, it became very reasonable."

The food, the service, entertainment value and demeanor of the staff are top shelf. It is similar to other hibachi-style restaurants that adhere to the Benihana model. The hibachi meals typically include two selections of fish, chicken, beef, scallops, shrimp, etc. along with a salad, miso soup and ice cream for dessert. The freshness, seasoning and quality of the ingredients was noticeable and frankly superior to Benihana-- and were delivered with a much more reasonable price. 

The chefs had fun with the table and put on an interactive show (broccoli flips or sake shots into diners&#39; awaiting mouths). The plastic squirt bottle character the chef brought out to &#39;urinate oil&#39; on the grill was a welcome and hilarious Friday night bonus. I observed another reviewer on here who seemed offended by the gag and found it &#39;inappropriate&#39; but sour grapes patrons so tightly wound are pedantically predictable and completely missing the point of the entertainment value (e.g. Baby Housman&#39;s rage monster father from &#39;Dirty Dancing&#39;, Rose DeWitt Bukater&#39;s horrifically judgmental mother from &#39;Titanic&#39;, etc.). There are multitudes of restaurants out there with a drab and priggish atmosphere for those who yearn for it; I much prefer a more festive demeanor. As Dick Van Dyke reminds us at 90-- the key to a long happy life is to never take ourselves too seriously. I hope the hibachi chefs seek out even more props!

We were thrilled to find a place like this close to home and will definitely be returning. I wanted to share feedback on this as soon as we got home because it is so important to support well-run top quality local restaurants given the mediocrity of the majority of dining establishments out there; these folks focus on the fundamentals and they got the formula right!"

And this is all within the last 6 months. The food is great and the sushi tastes fresh. I go here with some coworkers after our shift and its great because not many sushi places are open till 11 on weekends. And this one is! 
My only complaint is that although (on Saturdays) they close at 11, they sometimes close up early, about 10:30, and all stand at the front door waiting for you to leave. They sometimes even come up to the table and say you have to go. Politely of course, but to me, if your open till 11, that&#39;s when you should go up to people, or 5-10 minutes prior but not 30. I understand though, I worked as a server before too, and people just want to get home. But if 11 is too late for the whole staff, because they all have to wait for one another it seems like, then make closing 10."

Making its home in the spot formerly known as Nest Café, it is a welcome addition to the barrage of fast food type chains up and down Route 59.

We arrived around 6:30pm mid-week and found an almost empty parking lot.  Panic struck as we walked up to the door - I&#39;m about to get blamed for a less than adequate dinner...dun, dun, dun!  A smiling family walks out the door.  I&#39;m feeling gutsy and ask how dinner was.  They rave...I&#39;m satisfied and we walk inside.

We are greeted immediately by a hostess who escorts us to the dining area.  Immediately, we notice the lack of overhead hoods above the hibachi grills.  We&#39;ve been to many hibachi restaurants and have never seen one without the overhead hoods.  This concerns me a bit for the long-term.  Won&#39;t it start to smell really greasy inside and where is the cooking smoke going?

We take a seat, decide on drinks and are joined by a family of four.  The server brings sealed, hot towelettes to wipe our hands.  Drinks are served and kept full the entire meal.  My glass was being refilled before it was even empty.  I could get used to this. :-)

Overall, the food was very good.  Our chef was not overly interactive, unless you count when he squirted everyone with water from an inappropriate-in-mixed-company-especially-with-kids-squeezy-toy.  I had noticed the toy (see photo) and couldn&#39;t figure out why it was on the chef&#39;s cart, but I soon learned.  This was not my favorite part of the meal.  The sequence of the food did not seem to follow what we are used to either.  We started with the soup which made sense and was tasty, but it wasn&#39;t very hot.  My husband pointed out that it was served in cold bowls with cold spoons which probably brought the temperature way down.  Next came the salad which was what we expected.  I really liked the dressing.  They included cucumbers and tomatoes, so it wasn&#39;t just lettuce and carrots.  Another plus.  Then, we received the fried rice and noodles.  This made no sense.  Where was the shrimp appetizer?  And, why not serve the fried rice OR the noodles?  The extra charge for the rice was illogical since it was unnecessary.  Give diners the choice of one or the other and don&#39;t charge extra or allow diners to have both for an extra charge.  Anyhow, then a portion of my protein arrived - the garlic shrimp.  These were delightful!  And not overcooked...kudos!!  The rest of the proteins followed around the table.  Then, came the shrimp appetizer followed by the overly al dente veggies.  Before we were done eating, the server was suggesting ice cream.  I sent her away.  We weren&#39;t ready.  When she did return and I did have my scoop of chocolate ice cream, it was a disappointment.  First, it had been pre-scooped.  It was obvious it had started to melt at some point and was re-frozen because it looked melted, but was hard as a rock.  Then, it was in a small ice cream cup that was only about half full.  It was the tiniest scoop of ice cream ever.  Hardly makes it worth mentioning except for the fact that it&#39;s part of the meal and every other hibachi restaurant doesn&#39;t leave me with a partial scoop of ice cream as my last impression.  

We had a coupon which they promptly honored.  

Was it worth a try - absolutely, yes.  Will we go again - probably.  Is it my new go-to hibachi restaurant - not yet.  It&#39;s nearby and in our hometown which is where we prefer to spend our money, but they&#39;ve got a few details to work out."

It is a bit pricey but the quality has always been good with decent sized rolls. The problem we always have is the service. It takes a long time to get drinks ordered/made, you have to flag down the server to order food, and then paying for your meal is a long process. You need to stay on top of them to make sure you are receiving items in a timely manner. It took close to 40 minutes yesterday to get our 4 sushi rolls after we received a couple of other customers orders. We keep coming back hoping that service has improved. I think this was the last time though unless we need a close sushi fix"

After walking in we waited 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. Then we were seated in the sushi bar. The menu was a little confusing and getting the waitress to help us was like pulling teeth. After we received our Luke warm watered down soup and our salad , we had to wait for about 20 minutes for my wife&#39;s sushi dinner. Then after that was gone I then received my salmon hibachi dinner about 15 minutes later. The whole time we were eating there was about twenty people in the entrance waiting to be seated. There is almost no place to sit and wait so they all just stand in a crowd looking at us eat. So the food was good but the service was horrible. So bad I would never return."

We came on a Tuesday around 5, so not during peak hours. We were immediately say and given menus. We ordered our drinks which arrived promptly. My husband ordered a spicy tuna roll to start with. I ate one piece and instantly thought it didn&#39;t taste fresh nor did it have the spicy mayo and &#34;crunch&#34; as the menu said. We checked with our waitress and she said it was spicy tuna and walked away. Not worth the price! For dinner,  I ordered the chicken and my husband ordered the steak hibachi. With those entrees comes soup and salad, which were good. The hibachi chef came out and did a little show, and then we caught cold broccoli in our mouths, yep cold. We opted to pay the $2 extra for the fried rice (each) Don&#39;t waste your money! It is white rice, soy sauce and egg..... Nothing to justify an upgrade. Now it does come with noodles, which were decent. The steak and chicken were heavily marinated in teriyaki, too salty for my liking. By this time I was done with this place and barely ate my dinner. Our service was poor for the amount of people in the restaurant, one other table. I cannot stand when water glasses are empty for extended periods of time especially  when I can see servers on their phone, not ours but another. The hibachi chef has nice but I felt like he skimped on the show, which is disappointing because that&#39;s why we came. Our server was just okay, not much of a personality and was not helpful when it came to the sushi issue. We did have a groupon however, we most likely will not return. There are much better Hibachi restaurant out west (Ju Rin). Regretting we came here."

Our orders were finally taken, she rushed out salad and soup. The soup was tasty the salad was a mess and we decided to be safe and not eat what&#39;s not cooked. Our grill master came out and it took maybe 10 minutes then he left no interaction at all!! He did an egg trick and the volcano but didn&#39;t talk, it was just really weird. I really really wanted to love this place but I really don&#39;t. The food was gross and they use the same flavored butter on everything they cook on the grill so everything tastes the same.

We were on a mission.  A mission for sushi and a lot of it. 
Of course we sat at the sushi bar and it was kind of nice because we were the only ones in that room, but it was also Sunday at about 4pm.  We like that early bird special of course.  Early bird special as in we&#39;re like old people and eat early and go to bed early.  

I can&#39;t even tell you what we ordered because we ordered so much.  Let me try and remember: Crunch Roll, Spicy Roll, Salmon Nigiri, Salmon Roe, Super White Tuna, and my boyfriend got some weird stuff with quail egg on it and about 4 more rolls I&#39;m forgetting.  
The display was beautiful!  We had three VERY full plates of sushi and each one was displayed differently but a lot of effort went into the presentation of every plate.  I loved it! There were SO many specialty rolls to choose from, which is probably why we had three plates worth of sushi.  They were all delicious and very large and in charge!

We purchased a Groupon that entitles you to $30 of food for $17.  Upon presenting the Groupon, we were told we had to purchase $50 worth to use it.  The Groupon did not say anything about $50.  So we purchased more food to go to make up the difference even though we felt it was wrong.  The server then SCOLDED us, saying &#34;Next time, you can&#39;t use it for carryout, just so you know&#34; when she brought our food.
After we had already paid for all this, we again showed her the Groupon and she looked closer and then said, &#34;Oh, well, we changed it.  It used to be that way.  It doesn&#39;t say $50 now.&#34;   Uh, can you say, &#34;Bait and switch&#34;??
No apology, no making it right, no getting the manager.  Just RUDELY stomped away!  They just lost regular customers."

We had two sushi rolls, they had a tempura shrimp specialty roll with apple, one of the best pieces of sushi I&#39;d ever eaten. 

Inexpensive compared to other hibachi places I&#39;ve been to."

Like others have said, the service is not good, 1 1/2 to 2 stars at best.  We had a 6:30 reservation, and when we got there we were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait, which was fine until it turned into a 20 minute wait before we got seated.  After that we waited another 20 minutes before we got anything to drink.  I get that going to a hibachi place is not fast food, but 40 minutes to sit and get a drink is crazy (especially with a hangry missus!).  When the waitress finally came back to get our order we were smart enough to get two more drinks because she never came back again until she dropped off the check.  On to the food....
     We started with an udon soup (which was basically mushroom noodle).  It had no taste at all. Weirdest of all was that the mushrooms in the soup were desert dry.  How do you manage to have something taste dry sitting in a liquid???? It seems like something NASA would be interested in because I can&#39;t figure out how they did it.
     Next, we had a salad.  I&#39;m not sure how authentic iceberg lettuce is to Japanese is but I got a bowl of it.  It was watery and not good at all.
     The dinner portion was better.  The chef at the other table was better than ours: he was funny, engaging, and put on a good show, which is the whole point of hibachi.  With our guy, it just seemed like it was time to make the donuts to him.  Not a lot of show but the food was decent.  I had fried rice, which was decent, noodles in ginger sauce which were excellent, and chicken and scallops, which was also good.  The missus had steak and shrimp.  I tried both and they were good.
The price to me was high...76 bucks for two meals and 4 drinks, but fortunately we had a groupon. Even with the groupon, with the poor service, high price and mediocre food, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place and won&#39;t go back.  You can go to any chain place and get better service, value, and food"

Sushi taste like it&#39;s been used again and the yellowtail ones look like some old person with no dentures chewed it and put it back. Their miso soup taste like someone farted on it The octopus sushi taste like someone use it to clean the dishes and rolled it back with sticky rice. The edamame taste like someone stuff it inside their nose and put it back in the pod. The squid taste like ear wax with shricha sauce on top, and their mackerel smells like someone rub it In their armpit. Maybe that&#39;s why the waitress is in the bad mood for eating this crap. Not happy with this place."

Our chef was amazing his own theatrics were awesome, very friendly, funny and kept serving me sake and was most enjoyable.

Among the entertainment is drowning the customers in sugar water, patrons get their eyebrows singed with fire, and broccoli is catapulted into faces with the intent of landing into mouths.  The food was nothing to speak about with watered down sauces and no flavor. The empty dishes where left on the table soup bowl, salad, bowl, plate, ice cream cup. There was an extra bit of bamboo from maybe a  bamboo steamer in my food. I am very disappointed and hope the management cools down the antics and improves the quality."

Phenomenal. Pieces didn&#39;t taste fishy. No soy or ginger needed! Rest of the party got hibachi. Best chef ever at a hibachi house (Evan)!! Very engaging. Everything was delicious!

When we first started coming here everything was spot on... an easy 5 star rating! The hibachi chefs were/are fabulous, the food was delicious, service was great. Then little by little the smaller details were falling to the wayside (drink orders took too long, drinks were wrong or tasted bad, appetizers came out after main course food was done, replacement fork took 15 minutes to get). The food luckily stayed delicious! 
My carryout experience seemed to have the same quality dwindling experience. I usually order the same rolls - Everything was great the 1st order and maybe the 2nd order but by the 3rd time the quality just wasn&#39;t there. The rolls were falling apart, the container was just a clear container (before it was a nicer container with a dark bottom) and by the time I ordered this last time the sweet potato in my rolls were still hard, there was just a glob of wasabi and glob of ginger on the side (before there was a cute piece of garnish separating them) 
I&#39;m really disheartened by the dwindling quality/service. Everytime we dine here (hibachi) we have a GREAT time despite the shortfalls. Management at Tokyo Steakhouse II please fix these shortfalls!"

Big mistake on my part. Don&#39;t order anything sushi unless you like what they call eel sauce but tastes nothing like any I&#39;ve had before. Had a lobster roll and struggled to swallow it since I couldn&#39;t quite tell what it tasted like. Needless to say I didn&#39;t eat either of those choices beyond one piece. I wouldn&#39;t go for the golden shrimp either. This is usually my favorite at any Japanese hibachi house but the egg had separated into a greasy mess and the shrimp were so over cooked they were beyond rubber. They were rock hard and inedible. If I hadn&#39;t ordered fried rice the entire meal would have been a loss and even that had very little flavor. It was pretty bland but at least it tasted ok. The rest smelled bad, tasted worse and now I&#39;m hoping I don&#39;t pray to the porcelain throne tonight. I won&#39;t be darkening this doorstep again."

This place did not disappoint and was better than most places. We walked in and it was packed. Greeted at the front and waited at the bar until our habachi table opened up. They have so many drink specials. A wide variety of sake and martinis. The bartender was fast and sociable. Barely noticed we were waiting for a table. While we waited we had a sushi roll at the bar . It was delicious! As we made our way to our habachi table I noticed how much fun all the other tables were having. I opted for the steak and chicken which came with rice, noodles, vegetables, soup and salad! And the a scoop of ice cream for dessert. Service was great. A little hard to understand the waitress but she was lovely with a great attitude and eager to please and check on her table. I left with plenty to take home and enjoyed it for lunch the next day.

They have a lot of rolls to choose from. The first time we went the service was a little slow, but it&#39;s improved each time we&#39;ve been in, so I think that they might have just needed to get into their groove.

We were greeted and seated very quickly in the Hibachi area of the restaurant.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated and the hibachi area has modern grills with the ventalation built into the table instead of those nasty overhead exhausts so the space is open.  I got some spicy yellowfin Maki to go with my hibachi steak and my wife got shrimp and steak, but she needed gluten free.  All courses were excellent and well prepared and they added a course of udon which you don&#39;t normally get at Benihana or Domo.  The food in general was a step above both those places from a flavor standpoint.  They were very accomodative of my wife&#39;s gluten sensitivity, cooking her meal in the kitchen.  Veggies were fresh, everything was excellent.  Priced a little more reasonably than Domo or Benihana.  

If you are in for Hibachi, definitely would recommend!"

So I did a word search on Yelp and to my surprise...Hoy&#39;s Chinese Restaurant in Bensenville serves it!  
But I decided to pick up my order, so this is what I got:
-6pcs crab rangoon.  It came with a sweet orange marmalade dipping sauce.  it was more cream cheese than crab meat but it was ok, typical I&#39;ll get it again. 

-Small wonton soup, it had a lot of vegetables and the broth was good too.  The wonton itself was just enough wonton wrapper covering grounded pork balls.  It had a &#34;porky&#34; taste to it though, I didn&#39;t care much for it.  It wasn&#39;t like Chinatown wonton soup, but it will do.

-Large Combination fried rice.  This was good, had enough pieces of small shrimp, pork, beef, and chicken.  However, it was a bit salty but overall it was ok (I had better though).

-Salt &amp; Pepper Smelt Fish.  I asked for extra crispy and some were crispy and others were still a bit chewy.  My guess because it was take out not served dinning in so maybe the steam made some of it chewy?  It did have a good amount of seasoning.  The pepper was sautéed minced jalapeno peppers.  I was eating the smelt like french fries, but look it&#39;s fish!  It also comes with a small order of white rice too.

This place is in a strip mall with a small parking lot.  The lot was busy on a Sunday evening.  The place is a small restaurant, but big enough to dine in and the staff is friendly.  They also sell fresh fruit smoothies but no tapioca balls here.  They also offer lunch and dinner specials as well.  I like their user friendly website and the option to order online and have it delivered or pick up.

Overall, the food was good and the price is fair.  Until there is another place that serves salt and pepper smelt fish by me, I will for sure come back here for it."

I counted every piece... all 4 of it.  I wouldn&#39;t have mind paying more.  If I knew there was only 4 I would of asked to pay more for double or triple shrimp.  The sauce was generic and bland and the spring rolls were drenched in oil.  I would not order from here again.

Ordered a Beef &amp; Broccoli and a Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken for take out.

Pros:
I like that you can order online
Serving sizes are pretty much the same as China Pearl
Prices are pretty much the same as well
Restaurant is obviously newer and more updated
Person I dealt with was really nice

Cons:

I ordered Beef &amp; Broccoli
of all the places I have had this before (not too many) I have never had it come with carrots. 
Wasn&#39;t really expecting that. It tasted pretty good, but there def. was not as much beef as the other place. Broccoli was cooking thoroughly and wasn&#39;t crunchy.

Sweet &amp; Sour Chicken
Was disappointed with this. 
Portion size - great! Amount of actual chicken in that portion - NOT great! There were these little cubes of chicken with a huge amount of breading around it. 
Breading - not the same as the other rest. (Theirs tastes better to me)
Sauce - was very thin and watery - makes for a messy dinner when kids like to dip. Other rest is thicker and tasted much better.

All in all -  I will be sticking with the other rest."

The general tso&#39;s chicken needs improvement. It was dry and lacked a lot of flavor. The thick sauce was definitely off. I also requested it to be extra spicy but mine had no kick at all! I should mention I have a low tolerance for spicy food.

I order from here about 3 times a month. I get deliver and sometimes I dine in. Delivery is fast. They never disappoint me they&#39;re never late. Best delivery ever.

It was stir-fried with a few green beans, and a huge portion of celery, carrots onion, and the mystery meat which was hard to tell if it was chicken or pork, bit definitely not minced. How much for a pound of string beans in supermarkets? $3 top? It had to be substituted for some cheap veggies? The owner of the Hoy is way too cheap.

I vowed that I would not rest until I found a restaurant that offered Beef Chow Fun. I drove well out of my way to pick up my order here at Hoy&#39;s. On three different occasions, with three different ratings. Consistency is clearly not their strong suit. 

First order: tender beef, although sparse. Noodles perfect texture. Yes! Score! Worth the drive! Tummy is very happy!

Second order: tough beef, more of it. Noodles too soft. Meh, Tummy was hungry, and settled for this inferior dish. 

Third order: REALLY tough beef and too much of it. Noodles way too mushy. Tummy was ticked off, along with the rest of me. 

Third order also included chicken fried rice for someone else, who pronounced it the WORST fried rice they had ever had, and threw most of it away.

Solid portions with consistent taste and quality, what more could you want? Good service and with a positive attitude, they have that too! 

I have had many things on the menu and have never been disappointed. 

Now when it comes to Chinese food, my fondness comes in the form of Americanized Chinese food. I don&#39;t eat with chopsticks and I am from Chicago. I doubt this is true traditional Chinese food but if you come to Bensenville for traditional Chinese food maybe you should reflect within. Americans don&#39;t like real Chinese food, which is why we have the bastardized version we know and love. 

The decor inside leaves a bit to be desired but keep in mind the price, quality, and location then you will soon appreciate the simple but effective decor. I like that I am not being visually accosted with smoothie signs and giant cat statues. But that is just me... 

Finally, for out of towners and Chicagoans alike, Chinese food is like pizza in our fine city. Everyone likes something different and thinks what they like is absolutely the best. Just like I suggest with pizza, go and try the place but get the safe bet and decide if you like what they do well, if you like the place venture deeper into the menu. 

The parking lot can be a bit cramped but it is easy to get in and out of. 

All in all, I will continue to eat at this fine strip mall Chinese Restaurant..."

When you order take out or delivery, they do not include the soup. On more than one occasion I&#39;ve gotten food delivered and its taken more than an hour.

The husband is away for the weekend, and while I consider myself a pretty fine cook, everyone knows it&#39;s easier and more fun to cook for two than one. Plus, he doesn&#39;t think he likes Chinese food (crappy food as a teen, we&#39;ll try it again sometime) so I took the opportunity to grab some takeout on my way home. I pass Hoy&#39;s every day, so it was a logical choice.

The restaurant is not very big, but has a decent-size dining room for eating in. I perused the large menu briefly and selected a small wonton soup and Taiwan Style Rice Noodles, described as &#34;Taiwan style thin rice noodles mixed with shredded pork, pea pods, peppers, carrots, bean sprouts and onions.&#34;

About 10 minutes later, I had my piping hot bag in hand and was out the door.

Even though it seemed a touch overpackaged, I appreciated that the soup was in its own small plastic bag and then a bigger paper bag inside the largest plastic bag, so there was no chance of leakage. 

The soup was packed with veggies -- unusual for wonton soup -- and instead of one or two big wontons, it contained maybe six or seven small meatball-sized wontons. The broth wasn&#39;t quite as flavorful as I&#39;m used to, but I appreciated the tons of cabbage and sprouts. 

The rice noodles was a HUGE portion -- easily enough for two people. It was flavorful and the veggies were fresh and plentiful. There was also plenty of pork, although I do have one small quibble -- it wasn&#39;t shredded. I was expecting small pieces of pork that looked more, well, shredded. Instead it was big slices and strips, and some of it was a bit on the chewy side. Oh, and it also contained egg, which is not mentioned in the description. That said, it was fresh-tasting and good.

I&#39;m always pleased with the service: staff is friendly and my order is consistently ready within 5-10 minutes.  I&#39;ve tried a number of dishes and find that most of them taste all too similar with an excess of sauce, but there are a few standouts for me.

The salt and pepper shrimp is quite good.  Any shrimp dish has plenty of shrimp and they&#39;re sizable, too - no shrimpy shrimp here.  I also like the moo shu shrimp. Portions are huge.

The salt factor is too high on a lot of dishes, especially the fried rice.  It&#39;s tasty, but there&#39;s too much salt/soy sauce/whatever it is they use.

Nevertheless, this is one of the better lunch spots in the Bensenville area."

But I came for the food and I won&#39;t be back. The quality was fine, but definitely not Chinese. My chow fun was watery... not deliciously greasy like I&#39;ve had all my life. The crab rangoon comes in flat stuffed pockets filled with a surprisingly light cream cheese. The governors chicken is soft even though its fried... you definitely cant taste the calories you&#39;re eating.

What a disappointment."

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoy the occasional panda express as much as any other person but when I go to a chinese restaurant I expect something different. The red flag from the get-go was that you had to ask to get chopsticks and they serve water instead of hot tea; this would be unacceptable for a restaurant that regularly serves chinese people.

Service was pretty good like people have mentioned, very courteous, friendly and prompt. The waiter earned a good tip despite my qualms with the food.

My fiance and I decided to share the mongolian beef and general tao&#39;s chicken. The general tao&#39;s chicken which I ordered extra spicy came out nothing but sweet. The corn-starch battered chicken was nice and tender but just covered in what seemed like red corn syrup. I know general tao&#39;s chicken is not a traditional chinese dish but i&#39;ve had renditions where the flavors of sweet, tangy, and spicy were blended waay better with pieces of onions and sauted dried red chilis. Instead, the only thing accompanying the chicken were pieces of blanched broccoli which was actually enjoyable because it wasn&#39;t slathered in sweet sauce. The mongolian beef was a much better dish with plenty of green onions, white onions, and tender beef cooked in a corn-starch soy-based sauce which had a good flavor but was a little too dilute. This was more like what I was expecting but the dish really was underwhelming. The chicken fried rice was fine and the egg drop soup really lacked dimension and savoriness although the consistency was good and the egg perfectly blended into the soup. I think the base they use for the soup simply needs work, a cleaner chicken broth with subtle hints of garlic and ginger would be much better.

Overall I found the food to be americanized and average at best, i&#39;m really not sure whether I would take panda-express over this. The quantity is definitely a strength of the dishes but the quality and attention to detail is severely lacking. This restaurant would greatly benefit from returning to the rustic basics of real chinese food and trying to bring out the flavors of the ingredients instead of over-powering them with mediocre sauces."

It&#39;s surely not gourmet food, andt it&#39;s certainly not authentic, but for what they do, they&#39;re the best.

Hoys has a spot in my heart for a few main reasons. They are fast, fresh, consistent, have mammoth portion size &amp; the price is unbeatable. As I previously mentioned, it&#39;s not gourmet food, so don&#39;t go in expecting that.

I&#39;ve dined in, but typically order. I usually order the orange chicken and always get the hot &amp; sour soup and a egg roll to boot. Too much? Yeah, I know... They&#39;re always fast, the food is always good, and I feel confident saying they are the best Chinese take out I have EVER had.

Bottom line, this place is epic. I can&#39;t complain about anything, because I&#39;ve had nothing but good experiences here. Order, and tell me I&#39;m wrong!"

I&#39;ve said before that this is the worst Chinese restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to and sadly, it still holds true. 

The name of the game for this place is quantity over quality. If you&#39;re looking for a big meal of subpar Chinese food, then go right ahead. I did not come expecting gourmet, but I certainly expected better than what I got. 

This time, I did not order off the lunch menu in hopes for a change. I got a wonton soup to start and the Lucky 7 Chef Special and crab rangoons for us to share. 

The wonton soup was bland. The only nice thing was they put a good amount of small wontons in the soup, whereas usually restaurants will put 2 large pieces. However, the wontons and the broth were way under seasoned and not appetizing. 

The Lucky 7, I figured, had to be good because it was one of the most expensive things on the menu and I didn&#39;t care because my company was paying. I was again disappointed. The jumbo shrimp was the only nice part but only about 5 pieces. Lots of fish that was poor quality and rubbery and the scallops were almost non existent. Also, I understand that when you order carryout and food sits, sauce becomes congealed. However, my food was piping hot and had congealed jelly throughout the dish. This makes me think it was frozen and defrosted. It was not appetizing at all. I would not recommend this dish at all. 

The crab rangoons may cater to some people&#39;s liking, but I did not particularly like the taste of their filling either and way too much. Overall, another lackluster order from Hoy&#39;s and I will for sure not be going back.

For the love of god, please try Wonton Gourmet as an alternative. This place is not far and is AUTHENTIC Chinese food."

On weekend if I pass by I would order their yang chow fried rice or Hawaiian fried rice, taste more like cantonese style. I might also order the Chicken chow mein (pan fried style), i just blame it is a bit too salty sometimes. Their wonton soup and hot &amp;sour soup are Super, must try!! they don&#39;t serve dessert but i you really need sugar, you can try their sweet bun (very delicious) and their iced honey lemon drink.

A little background. I grew up going to my best friends&#39; Chinese restaurant. His dad would cook us the most amazing dinners from things both on and off their menus. Our group of friends tends to be VERY picky about out Chinese food.

The restaurant is in a strip mall in Bensenville right off of Irving Park Rd. It looks pretty basic from the outside. The inside is very nice, sort of that traditional 80&#39;s chinese place with the placemats that have the Chinese zodiac on it...you know the one...where you laugh at your dad for being a &#34;dog&#34; just like Garth Brooks. The nice thing is that it doesn&#39;t have 30 years of grime on everything. It&#39;s very classy.

Food and service are top notch. Their dinner special HUGE entree, soup, egg roll, and fried rice for $9.95 is INSANE. The staff at Hoy&#39;s allowed us to substitute everything which was also very cool. Dishes can be made hot or mild if you have picky eaters.

Best of all soda is $.70. YES. 70 CENTS. Granted, its just a can and not free refills, but if you are on a diet, you can just have one and if you want a second it will hardly cost you an unholy 2 or 3 dollars.

Some favorites: General Tao&#39;s Chicken, Kung Po Shrimp, Schezuan Chicken, Orange Chicken, WON-TON SOUP!

A comment about their Won-Ton soup. Won-Ton soup is the most boring staple of Chinese soups. This place makes theirs with tons of fresh vegetables piled in with the wonton and broth. INCREDIBLE.

If I could give this place 6 stars I would. The staff is incredibly nice and though there&#39;s a bit of a language barrier we have a lot of fun every time I&#39;ve been in."

Instead, this was some of the most mediocre Chinese food I&#39;ve ever had. 
To start off with, they didn&#39;t seem to know how to handle the vegetarian we were dining with. As the appetizers came out, they gave him pork and shrimp eggrolls despite clear statements of his vegetarian status, although to their credit they did reluctantly replace it. For those of us who were able to eat the eggrolls, they were gross - far too crispy, nearing on burnt. I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s possible to screw up a generic pre-frozen eggroll, but they managed to do it. Also, the Hot and Sour soup was one of the worst soups I&#39;ve ever tasted in my life - I&#39;m not a big fan of it, but the person in the group who ordered it was, and they too thought it was gross. The potstickers were cold, and also clearly prefrozen.
The menu was the typical Americanized Chinese fair, so I chose the diced chicken in hot sauce. It was basically sesame chicken, and the chicken itself was the gross type that seems to be ubiquitous in bad Chinese places and weirdly fried. Either they gave me the wrong dish or they have weird ideas of what constitutes &#39;hot sauce&#39;.
The pretty good fried rice, the generous portions, the great condiments and the decent price help to make up a little bit for the faults. Still, those don&#39;t really make it worth going to."

The rice was okay, but had a flavor of dirty fryer oil, or a dirty grill.  The sweet and sour chicken was okay, but the smaller pieces had too much breading, and were very hard to chew.

Personally, I order from them a few times a month. They even delivered during a massive snowstorm. It took some time but it was totally understandable.

And to top it off, they always seem to be throwing random free food into my order, extra eggrolls, free crab rangun (which I don&#39;t enjoy, but my friend loves).

Crowd isn&#39;t my type of crowd but food looked delicious and they had a great selection of booze.  Place was pretty crowded since they were having a concert (Bobaflex) and after quickly listening to their music on google, I thought to myself &#34; I should probably get my double hearing protection from the car&#34; or? &#34;I should just finish this beer before my ears starts bleeding&#34;.  I chose the latter.  

Their menus look pretty darn good, might have to check this place out for lunch on a weekend."

This place is super cool and the service was great, but don&#39;t come here if you are looking for amazing food. Come here if you are looking for drinks. 

The food is good and there are a ton of different options, mainly burgers and sandwiches. The French fries and onions rings are really good also. Great flavor and lots with each serving.

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and really enjoyed it, but wish it had a little bit more flavor. I like spicy foods, but it wasn&#39;t quite that. My friend ordered one of the burgers. He said it was delicious and cooked perfectly. It came with sautéed mushrooms and onions, cheese and some other ingredients all on a pretzel bun. 

The alcohol selection is impeccable though, full bar with lots of specials.

The prices are a little steep though. If I were to go back, I would stick with just drinks."

BURGERS + BEER + BABES + BANDS + BACKROOM PINBALL

Oh yes.

It&#39;s like Brixie&#39;s got pregnant with a kid from Kuma&#39;s Corner and their offspring received the best qualities from both parents, then during adolescence it got really into punk rock.

Following months of just enjoying their (admittedly awesome) pinball selection and giant 24oz PBR &#39;silos&#39;, I finally came here to eat a sustainable meal, and about damn time!  A lot of what&#39;s available on their menu is centered around metal/thrash/grindcore music, and more than one selection was catered towards people who love spicy stuff.

My folks and I came here for T.G.I.F. dinner and ordered appetizers not long after we got seated.  The chips + dip came out with salsa and guacamole; we all agreed that the chips were delicious and likely fried in-house.  We also got an order of the jalapeno poppers, which were gargantuan deep fried zeppelins, much larger than one would expect.  Those big f*ckers were fresh, stuffed with gooey cheese and really brought the heat.  Tasty, though.

We each ordered different burgers for our main courses.  My mom went with the &#39;Viking Skull&#39;, which came with a fried egg, bacon, onion and green peppers.  Dad enjoyed his &#39;Blaster&#39;, which featured blue cheese, garlic aioli, sun-dried tomatoes, bacon, red onions, and (get this)......olive tapenade.  They loved their choices immensely.

I, however, wasn&#39;t a fan of my selection.  I opted for the &#39;Hellbilly&#39;, their hottest burger.  It came loaded with pickled jalapenos, jalapeno-bacon sauce, spicy ketchup, lettuce, red onion, and crunchy tortilla strips.  For some reason, mine also came slathered in what looked like nacho cheese, which made for an exceedingly messy eat.  There were far too many clashing flavors going on, the burger quickly fell apart on me, and I honestly have no idea where the &#39;jalapeno-bacon sauce&#39; went, cuz that sh*t was nowhere to be found.

One of the great things about Brauerhouse is you get to choose from 5-6 bun options (i.e. brioche, kaiser roll, pretzel bun, toasted french roll, flour tortilla)  This makes for endless combinations, which encourages the customer to come back and find a burger matchup that works best!

All burgers are juicy  1/2-lb patties cooked to order and come with excellent homemade chips on the side [$11].  A reasonable value, if I must say.

Bread = 4.5
Circuses = 5+

The servers and atmosphere is what makes this place sparkle &amp; shine.  Every single bartender and server is a totally bodacious babe, many of whom have piercings (some possibly hidden, hey-o!), gauges, and tattoos a-plenty.  They&#39;re friendly, usually pretty timely/attentive, and are always, ALWAYS smokin&#39; hot.  Like what you&#39;d get if the gals from Hooters became roadies for The Misfits.

Besides being a solid restaurant and bar, Brauerhouse is a venue that also plays host to bands with colorful names like Harry Dick &amp; The Staples (?!?!)  At 8pm on a Friday, we saw people beginning to filter in -- after paying an undisclosed cover charge -- while they set up the stage for music.  I&#39;m told it can get exceedingly loud, so earplugs are available for purchase.

Their backroom (actually off on the left side when you walk in) includes half a dozen pinball machines, ranging from newer models like Stern&#39;s &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; &amp; &#34;Metallica&#34; to Williams classics like &#34;Dracula&#34; &amp; &#34;Monster Bash&#34;.  All games were 75¢ and in overall terrific condition.  They also have a pool table and digital jukebox in this area that sees very little foot traffic, thankfully.
____________

TL;DR

Come for the sexy, sizzlin&#39; service, stick around for the thrash punk (if that&#39;s your thing).  If it isn&#39;t, consider instead coming on a &#39;Cruise Night&#39; where muscle cars and motorcycles take over the parking lot.  If *that&#39;s* still too much biker for your blood, then a weeknight burger &amp; beer will do you well.

Certainly one of the better places in the Chicago suburbs to get your pinball fixation.  Y&#39;know, in case being serenaded by the local sounds of The Ringworm RiotShields isn&#39;t your cup of tea."

I recommend the pistachio pesto fries. If you get then then I recommend you ask for them well done otherwise they are a little limp but the flavor is fantastic.  Burgers are great &amp; chicken strip were juicy &amp; tender.  Junk salad with chipotle ranch is fantastic.  We finished off with a decadent fried snickers dessert.  Only reason they don&#39;t get 5 stars is service is a little slow but super cordial so if your not in a rush or want sit back &amp; catch a game this place is great.  I will be back 4 sure!!!!

We walked in, sat at the bar and were promptly serve by the blonde bartender. We received our beers and ordered some onion rings. We sat and enjoyed our beers and our onions rings were served to us hot and crispy. We proceeded to order or entrees and enjoy another round of beers. I will say that we always had our glasses full, but our food came out about 5 minutes apart and it took them another 5-10 minutes to grabbing back some ketchup and honey mustard. We finished an entire pizza and burger with fries before she came back with the condiments. Overall the food was delicious but the service was mediocre.

Our group was coming from Naperville, Aurora, and Roselle, so we decided Lombard right off the highway was a good spot to meet. We had six people in our group. My sister and her boyfriend got there first, so they reserved a table for all of us which happened to be up on the stage. It was pretty much the largest table in the restaurant, but hey - worked for us!

Our waitress greeted our table and let us know the drink special. $2 tall boy cans! What a throw back. Old Style? Yes please. On Thursdays they also have $5 bombs, $5 margaritas, and 49 cent wings.

After finishing our first beer we were asked if we&#39;d be ordering food. When we said yes, they said we&#39;d have to move to a different table if we wanted to stick around. Turns out the stage we were sitting on actually needed to host a band! Now I was all confused because I thought there was a cover on band nights and we didn&#39;t pay anything when we walked in. Maybe we arrived early enough? Either way, not complaining just confused.

Regardless, we were able to squeeze the 6 of us into a booth. The staff was helpful and even offered to get us a chair or two for the end of the booth. Plus, they gave us complimentary onion rings and a round of drinks for our trouble. You could say we were grateful and totally over the inconvenience!

The onion rings were pretty standard, but delicious none the less. Large, thick cut, crispy beer battered, greasy, and accompanied by delicious ranch dipping sauce. My husband and I decided to split the ultimate grilled cheese which includes jack cheddar and white american cheeses with bacon on sourdough bread. We ordered it without tomato because that&#39;s my hubbie&#39;s one bugaboo, but we added avocado for a small upcharge. They ended up being out of sourdough bread, so we went with rye. Their sandwiches come with homemade potato chips, but we opted for a side of their pistachio pesto fries instead. I mean come on, these babies are drizzled in a balsamic vinegar and finished with romano and parmesan cheese. The grilled cheese and fries were equally as delicious as the onion rings, but again, pretty (unhealthy) standard bar food if you ask me.

It should be noted that on Thursdays Brauerhouse is home to the famous Tire Swarm Car &amp; Bike Cruise aka Sons of Anarchy takeover. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a Sons of Anarchy nut and my husband loves motorcycles, but I was not prepared for this scenario. For starters, we looked super out of place. My husbands preppy polo stood out like a sore thumb against all the leather. It ended up being awesome people watching, but definitely contributed to the crowd.

Before we knew it the band was ready to rock. We really did not prepare for the noise level that was about to happen. Part of the reason we went out for drinks was to hang with my cousin before he moved out to the east coast. Needless to say we were basically screaming at each other across the table in order to hear. Not the best chatting scenario. I really did enjoy the music though. It was a rockabilly band with a lead singer that had a powerful voice like Adel. She was very entertaining.

To some up this experience I would say confusing. Between the cover or no cover situation, the seat change, the biker crew, and band... we didn&#39;t know what was going on! With that being said, I think Brauerhouse has a ton of potential for being a fun place to hang out at. They have all the essential ingredients - full bar, drink specials, delicious pub fare, and entertainment. Works for me. It wasn&#39;t working for this particular night however. If you&#39;re looking for a place to socialize with your group, Brauerhouse on a Thursday night is not it. If you want great music and cheap drinks... then head on over!

My tip to the team is to be a little more accommodating. Meaning, let folks know what&#39;s going on when they enter. It would be nice to know when and if you have to pay cover, if you need to seat yourself, and what&#39;s on the agenda for the night. I plan to pay Brauerhouse another visit at some point and will definitely report back!"

The food is delicious.  They have a gazillion specialty burger choices, plus pizza, salads, and appetizers.  There is also a kids menu.  My favorite salad is the Surfin Bird and my favorite sandwich is the Cheetah Chrome.  The hubs love the burgers with a fried egg on them and with tater tots.  I personally love the pesto fries.

This is good fun place to bring your family for a casual meal...on a weeknight before 8 pm....or on the weekend during the day.  If you bring the family closer the evening, your 5 year old may be confused by a burlesque show.  (He did not like their dancing or the fact that they were using newspapers as props.)

During the week, there are so awesome specials.  Once I went during the week and long islands were super cheap.  I had two and then took a nap in the car on the way home.  Luckily the hubs was driving....

Now I will say that my style is more trendy-working-mom than heavy metal-punk.  Sometimes I feel VERY vanilla here....but it doesn&#39;t matter.  The servers are usually smoking hot chicks with tattoo sleeves and nose rings.  But they are the nicest, friendliest, most helpful servers EVER!"

My favorite item on their menu is the Zombie burger. This is their trademark burger and I have ordered it many times. My former co-worker and friend recommended that I try the Lux Interior burger this time so I did. It was good of course but it was overcooked and dry. The description on the menu mentioned a bacon patty as well. There was some crushed bacon on there but not really a patty. I guess when you are hooked on Zombie burgers you should not be experimenting with the others. HA!

I also had the potato puffs with it and they were average. The appetizers on the menu are all good and the jalapeno poppers are the size of a large rat! Yum!

This place has come up with some amazing combinations! 
I&#39;ve had a few different burgers and they all nail the flavors as advertised. 

I had the Hellbilly burger and jalapeno poppers last time I came in and was more than enough for a meal! The poppers were HUGE, I could have just eaten those and been full. Then the burger comes out and I realized I was gunna need to be rolled out the door. Bacon Jalapeno mayo was really good on this burger. i would certainly come back for it again!

The ambiance is pretty sweet. It&#39;s a rock n roll bar. I&#39;ve been here on a night with a band and they don&#39;t hesitate to crank it up!

They have a great craft beer list that is always changing, tater tots (oh yeah), and funky, fun named burgers that are really good! The atmosphere is eclectic and funky. It reminds me of a more docile version of Kuma&#39;s Corner. Our server was very nice and did a great job of taking care of us throughout the evening. I had Rosemary&#39;s Baby burger, and it was packed full of flavor. It wasn&#39;t cooked medium rare like I asked for (it was more well done), but it still tasted really good.

As a music venue, I&#39;m not so sure. It was $10 to get it (we were already in and if we wanted to stay we had to pay $10 each). The band was really loud, and honestly not worth $10 a person. Maybe $5, but $10 seems like a bit much. It&#39;s not a huge place, but it never got very packed either. We didn&#39;t end up staying  for the show, but we saw enough of it to know we didn&#39;t want to stick around and pay $20.

Brauerhouse.

Honestly, Brauerhouse surprised me. I never expected such an ecclectic bar in a little strip mall slightly hidden from the road in this area of the &#39;burbs. Red and black decor, funky chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, tattooed waitresses, endless posters and flyers advertising upcoming events, and a crazy awesome menu with burgers, pizza, and lot of beer. And somehow, they manage to squeeze plenty of people here on a regular basis for shows, [risque] bingo nights, and other such events.

Actually, the first time I came here was a weekend night to see a friend play in his band. At this point, it had been a few years since I was at that time in my life where I went to see local bands every weekend -- so my going-out self was a bit rusty and overwhelmed. We were up all night, watching different bands, cheering along, and eating as much pizza as we could -- crammed into a booth while watching people dance (if you could call it dancing) on the floor space. Tables had been moved to allow space for people to gather (ahhh, so that&#39;s how they make room for everyone).

The next time I came here was on a bright afternoon with a group of fantastic Yelpers after a couple hours at the shooting range. We were accommodated at a big table in the corner, regardless of the charity event that was going on at the time. Our server was attentive, the food was satisfactory, and the beer was good. All good, all good.

Your experience here might be hit or miss depending on time of day, expecations, and the other crazy stuff going on at this bar. I was delighted both times I was here."

She handled it well but both parties felt a little awkward. Actually the other couple looked kind of pissed. 

We tried the Tachos, which were delicious and the pizza that had all the Reuben toppings. Sounded great in theory but I think we just prefer it on a sandwich or burger, which is no knock on them.. And they offer those things!

Foodies don&#39;t expect good food from a bar, and Brauerhouse surprises. First, take a look at the menu, those wraps and pizzas, even burgers. You will start to salivate because there are unique items, or even classics with their twist. Their west coast chicken pizza is a must try. While chains like CPK are investing so much into their pizza, you can find a very well balanced pie right here. The crust and bbq sauce with the citrus flavors really make this pizza a stand out on the menu, and I will add locally. We went with a safe bet on the buffalo chicken wrap as well. Still, not a bad wrap! check out my pic of this guy, good tortilla, seasoned fries, flavorful fillings and really fresh veggies. I need to get back in here to try more stuff! 

Other than the food, the ambiance is pretty out there, like a biker bar with a grungy concert vibe. The place might look like it should be a lot dirtier but its clean. the big window to look into the kitchen will also give you some comfort knowing the back of the house is very clean.

Of course, I got a burger because their burgers are truly phenomenal. Normally, I opt for the zombie burger but instead I tried something new. All their meals have fairly unique names, so I honestly can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called.... But it was great.

Not sure if they do shows or events anymore, since it&#39;s been a while since I have visited Brauerhouse (I live in the city now...), but if not, the place is still worth checking out for the pub grub."

The food sounds delicious but meh. Thrice I had a burger and each time, they kind of lacked flavor. The burger names are fun though!  The fried pickles were pretty good and I love that they have tater tots.....cause I&#39;m a child. 

It&#39;s located in a strip mall on the Northwest corner of 53 and North Avenue. Yup, call me Google Maps. 

I&#39;ve only been there a few times and it seems like they have live music some nights. I wouldn&#39;t mind going back for a few brewski&#39;s and some tots, maybe even some pizza."

Its kind of confusing when you come in because there isn&#39;t exactly a host or hostess. Basically, if there&#39;s a free table, you just grab it so it can be difficult at times. The environment is interesting. It&#39;s small and always packed here for lunch, so I&#39;d be curious to see how it is for a show at night. I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be a very comfortable place to watch a band, but I haven&#39;t been so I can&#39;t say much! This visit I went with my boss. Our server was Jianna and she was very friendly and helpful! I got the grilled cheese with avocado. It was really yummy! I wasn&#39;t a fan of their house made chips though. We also got the fried pickle spears as an appetizer. They were good, but I could only have one and a half since the sandwich was so filling and the pickles were pretty intense. The breading was really thick on them, which isn&#39;t a bad thing but I would have definitely had a tummy ache if I had eaten more."

Typically, the music hotspots are reserved for the Chicago neighborhoods, but Brauerhouse gives those places a run for its money. And the fact that it has amazing food and great beers makes it a definite go-to for the burbs.

I came here for the first time with a group of Yelpers. We had a big group, but it was a Sunday afternoon so there was room for all of us. Other times I&#39;ve been here have been for shows by local bands. This place is kind of a mix of bikers and rockers, but don&#39;t let that intimidate you. Anyone can have a good time here. 

The food is phenomenal. I&#39;ve had the ultimate grilled cheese and the zombie burger, both with tots. They knocked it out of the park. It&#39;s hard to find good tots but they&#39;ve got em. I&#39;ve also seen someone get the tater nachos. It&#39;s listed as a starter but beware: that thing is a friggin meal. It is huge and looks absolutely glorious. I&#39;ve heard the pizza is good here as well. As for drinks, they&#39;ve got tons of them. Plenty of craft beer options both on tap and bottle. Dale&#39;s Pale Ale, Three Floyds, Rouge, Ska, the list goes on. 

If you&#39;re going for a show, try to get there a little early, as seating goes quickly and there&#39;s not a lot of good options for standing. One gripe I do have is that the shows don&#39;t typically start on time. One time, the band was over an hour over the posted time. Not really a problem if its a weekend and you&#39;re planning to be there for a while, but it sucks if you&#39;re going to a show during the week and you have work the next day. Can&#39;t wait forever. That being said, I still highly recommend you try this out. The decor is pretty kooky (random signs, chandeliers, posters, dark walls, etc) but that just means there&#39;s no shortage of personality!"

Not sure why, the most complicated thing we ordered was a chicken sandwich.  I ordered a salad that had jalapenos on it, and the jalapeno slices were so big, they were inedible.  The chicken pieces were extremely tiny.  It also took our server forever to get us our checks.  Might be a good place to go and listen to bands, but eat beforehand"

Their giant burgers are outstanding, the quesadillas are out of control, the drink selection is a variety of unique options.  Oh don&#39;t forget to leave room for dessert -fried snickers and ice cream - yes please!

I recommend going on Sunday for half off Bloody Mary&#39;s.  They have daily specials throughout the week but something about greasy filling food with a Bloody Mary decorated with all the accouterments - is just so tasty!

My husband works around the corner, so I found an occasion to grab a burger with him recently. I&#39;m pretty glad that I did. 

Brauerhouse has bands regularly and things like midget wrestling. While we couldn&#39;t figure out where they put all those throngs of people, we imagine that people keep coming back for those tasty burgers. 

I really like that their kitchen has a wide open window, so you can see what&#39;s going on back there. This is something that makes me happy inside...they&#39;ve got nothing to hide. 

We ordered a couple sodas to start. I ordered a burger that wasn&#39;t exactly on their menu, but they made it happen. A medium cooked beef patty on a pretzel roll with bacon and an onion ring. Oh and their jalapeño bacon sauce on the side. It&#39;s important to note that I didn&#39;t eat the jalapeño bacon sauce because it was a cheese sauce and I had no idea of that fact from the menu. Our server did mention that the menu will be updated soon. It&#39;s kinda hard to read. I went with tater tots on the side for a slight upcharge. The husband went with a burger that he&#39;s had before - the zombie, I think - and their homemade potato chips. The burger was a mess all over the plate, but the flavors were good. 

We had good service and full drinks. I would definitely head back for a quick lunch or early dinner."

Unique setup, pinball, good beer selection and great food.  Get the Tater Tachos, you won&#39;t be disappointed. The Tachos alone are worth a visit. 

I give them 4 out 5 stars mainly because Brauerhouse has the same issue that lots of good beer places have. They have a great selection of beer but the Servers are almost clueless when it comes to what they have.  On top of that two times that I&#39;ve been there I tried ordering Lagunitas Little Sumpin Sumpin and both times &#34;they just ran out&#34;  One time was on a busy friday night..the other time was on a slow saturday afternoon.  If a place doesn&#39;t have a beer they should take it off their draft board.

The place is also a little hard to find, It&#39;s in a stripmall. I passed it up driving by for a couple years before even noticing it was there."

I went to their old location, and thought it was a cool bar.  But in a store front, it&#39;s a lot brighter and now I see it as more a restaurant than bar.  Which is cool by me, cause I don&#39;t really drink.

I had the zombie burger and it was hilarious and awesome.  Especially the day before Halloween.  Although it was by far the messiest burger that I ever had.  It&#39;s the kind of burger that once you pick it up you can&#39;t put it down because it will get all over the place.  That is not a bad thing at all to me.

The tater tots were excellent, and was a great touch.

I tried my friends Ultimate Grilled Cheese, and it was great too.

Love the theme here.  And, you might expect by seeing things around the store that the bathroom wouldn&#39;t be a highlight... it was actually really nice.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good the Grouper special was and everyone else enjoyed their foods.

By now I think it is safe to say I have tried all the burgers, most of the appetizers, and salads. Many times I&#39;ll walk in and order a pizza to go, and a couple of those times I forget to leave. I&#39;ve learned not to tell the wife I am bringing pizza home until I am driving away."

Paired with home made chips and an iced tea and all I really required afterward was a couch to snooze the afternoon away. 
Also tried the chips and salsa, zesty with the perfect amount of heat. It could only get better if they had a stage for punk rock and metal bands to shred- Oh wait, they do!

Faith was friendly, absolutely attentive, made great bar recommendations, and made us feel completely at home despite tables being removed for the show set-up; never felt remotely rushed.

Returned again on Sunday with my family and had Colleen as a server.  While there, my 6 year old nephew began to feel sick.  Colleen&#39;s care and concern for my nephew was absolutely stellar.  She checked on him often, brought him both hot and cold water to soothe his stomach, and even offered him 7UP.

Another server, whose name I did not get, even brought my nephew some tea/honey/lemon.

Nice little Sunday. 

It&#39;s a little slice of suburban punk rock in a strip mall off North Ave between 355 and Rohlwing Rd. I was a big fan of the old Brauerhaus before it burned down and I&#39;d been wanting to try it&#39;s reincarnation since it opened a few years back. The location is definitely kind of a strange one, not where you&#39;d expect a bar of this caliber to be, but it&#39;s a place that&#39;s absolutely worth checking out. 

They had an interesting looking cocktail list that I had a hard time saying no to, but I decided to stick with beer as their had some really great options... unfortunately they were out of quite a few things that their chalkboard menu said they were carrying, so I felt bad for my friends who had to call on a second choice, but they had my Modus Hoperandi so I was happy. 

I got the fried pickles because duh. They were perfect... and came with a side of ranch to dip. It&#39;s probably meant to be an appetizer but it was more than enough food for a meal for me. My dining partners all got burgers... smothered in cheese, bacon, and jalapenos and all the things that make me miss real meat burgers, including pretzel buns. 

I loved our server. She was tiny but mighty and super cute + sweet. It was my first time at this location so I wasn&#39;t sure about the drill on seating and such but she set us up at a big table and went through the drink list stat... which is exactly what I needed. 

And beyond their regularly scheduled theme and band nights, they have free pizza during all bears games. I don&#39;t really give a sh*t about sports, but I love free pizza, so I&#39;ll totally be back for another go at Brauer this season."

Deep fried, whole jalapenos packed with cheddar and cream cheese...an instant classic, and cheap way to my heart. Not for the mild stomach though, as they do pack a punch. Service has always been quick, and a spot at the bar nets a handful of TV&#39;s and your sports craving. Were the poppers not so satiable, I would have moved on to the inspirational burger menu. Maybe next I&#39;ll conquer the heralded &#34;Alpha&#34; burger or maybe some &#39;za... I&#39;ll be back! MUTHAA!"

This place serves wonderful and delicious American cuisine, is clean, has a cool atmosphere, is open late/early, and has live music.  What more could you want.

Seriously the food is fantastic.  The atmosphere of the place is great.  It&#39;s like old school rock &#39;n&#39; roll meets new age skater.

Definitely a place to check out if you are in the area."

The corned beef was as good as I have had in a long long time and they use it in interesting ways...Try the Nooner - corned beef, swiss, fried or scrambled egg, and jalapeno slaw...fantastic.  Cool vibe in a hard rock kind of way.  Oh, and a great bear selection...

Would definitely go back - would hope it was a little warmer in there...."

After seeing them on Chicago&#39;s Best TV, I just had to give the zombie burger a go. It was huge and had a great taste. The added side of  jalapeno coleslaw was a real treat. I traditionally shy away from a vinegar base slaw and stick to a creamy one. So glad I gave it a try. 

My next visit to their fine establishment, I&#39;ll be trying their &#34;Better Be Quick&#34; (BBQ) chicken sandwich, with the jalapeno slaw on it, with a side of the jalapeno bacon cheese sauce and some tater tots.

Half off pizza Tuesdays/Sundays and open mic Wednesdays, with $1 burgers or tacos is very tempting too. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depends how you see things) I&#39;m not a drinker but their daily drink specials, Sun-Thu. seem very reasonable. They even have free food at half time when the Bears are playing.

My guess this place gets hoping on Fri. and Sat. with the live music. There&#39;s a nice size billiards room too. There&#39;s even a good number of tables along the east side of the building outside."

I came here for a show.  Now, I&#39;ll be the first to admit few places outside of Chicago (in Illinois) excite me.  Lombard...definitely not one of them.  I discovered The Ogden this night and therefore didn&#39;t want to leave that place to come here, but I did.  

The punk scene was a joke.  I&#39;m pretty sure Hot Topic threw up in there, which would have been fine if people were actually decent.  The girl at the front bar didn&#39;t know how to make drinks.  I tried a few and had to keep giving them away because they were awful.  One of the girls at the back bar was actually very sweet, but apparently couldn&#39;t hear me as she kept grabbing the wrong beer.  Like I said, she was really sweet so we kept laughing over it.  The other bartender was horrible.  Not only did she repeatedly try and not give me back change (we&#39;re talking $10+ worth), she kept forgetting which shitty beer was which.  Those weren&#39;t for me and I didn&#39;t want to taste them to find out.  

I enjoyed hanging out in the handicapped stall in the bathroom.  There was a big pink chair and a mirror.  Anyhow, I think the place as a venue is so-so.  There are a lot of spots where you could get stuck with no view at all, but if you&#39;re lucky enough to grab a spot by the bar, you&#39;ll have no problem.  Have napkins on standby for when your beer falls on the girl in front of you, because it will happen.  

I actually hated this place, but since I went there with a bad attitude and didn&#39;t eat anything there, I felt it would be wrong to give it a lower rating than 3 stars."

That&#39;s not to say that salads can&#39;t be manly.  We&#39;ve all witnessed taco salads so hideous that they should have been renamed &#34;death by fried tortillas and seasoned beef with a sprinkling of juicy shredded iceberg for bare minimum salad purposes.&#34;

Here at the &#39;House (Haus?  House.), they have a lot of deadly and gnarly sounding burgers, pizzas, salads and sandwiches to match the ultra-stickered, punk, and metal music decor and ambience.  El Capitan.  Bolt Thrower.  Attack of the Killer Tomato Salad...and those are just some of the pizzas!

I came here with a few buddies with the intent of jamming at an open mic.  We were thwarted one week because they only actually have one of the advertised two guitar amps, so we returned two weeks later.  We wanted food before we crushed it onstage, so I had the aforementioned salad.  Within minutes, a meal fit for Zeus himself was in front of me.  They did NOT skimp on the chicken, and it was seasoned perfectly.  Plenty of fresh parmesan and dressing took care of the fresh romaine, but the salad was no match for this rocker.

Service?  Kind of what you&#39;d expect here.  A little flippant, but mostly good.  The bar gets the best service, but all the servers seemed like they were enjoying themselves except ours.  There&#39;s always one who you imagine responds to every request with a silent internal &#34;Buh.&#34;, and tonight we got her.

All in all, a decent place to rock out with your butcher&#39;s block out, and catch some great live music.  Get down to the House!"

Waitress at the bar took a good 10 minutes to even acknowledge my existence and to place an order.  When I finally got to order, I requested to separate my orders in different containers, and specifically asked for substitutions and paid extra for it. Waited in the car for the food and came back inside a little after the promised time.  I got inside and I waited patiently at the bar and asked for my order and her response was. &#34;Obviously it&#39;s not in the window, so it&#39;s not ready yet!&#34; I said okay, I continued to wait at the bar for another 10 minutes and the food finally came and she sat it in front of my without saying a word and walked off.. 

She basically expected a tip because I ordered at the bar even though I ordered to-go. Not worth it."

This place is like Cheers except most of the staff and many of the patron have more skin covered by ink than clothes.  And, the food is lots better...

I had a Zombie burger, which was delicious, and a side of &#39;tater tots, which were also quite good and make the waitress very happy.  The guy next to me had their Tater Tachos (yep, more tater tots) which looked great and could work as a meal even though they&#39;re listed (and priced) as a starter.  The guy on the other side of me had a burger and... yep, tater tots.  (Turns out, he worked there and was given an extra large portion so the waitresses could snack from them.)  

I hope I don&#39;t get anyone in trouble with that last bit and, what is it with these Tater Tots?  But, I digress.

There&#39;s lots of different beers.  I tried several and they were all cold.  I like that in a beer.

The unusual thing for me, though, was the atmosphere.  It&#39;s not hard to find cold beer.  It isn&#39;t *that* hard to find really good food (however, not at these prices).  What *is* rare is to find a place you can walk into and feel at home.

I will definately make a point of going back there the next time I&#39;m anywhere near Lombard."

After gaining a taste for beer, my husband and I went here for drinks and food.  Ah-mazing!! Large menu for a bar had so many incredible sounding options.  I had a chicken Caesar,  one of the best I&#39;ve EVER had.  Large portion with prefect sized chicken bites along with just the right amount to get some in every bite. Well seasoned and flavorful to boot! My husband loved the Buffalo wings so much he ordered them twice! The wait staff all were incredibly helpful and patient as we struggled to choose what we wanted. We must&#39;ve been there about 3 1/2 hours relaxing, drinking, eating.... no one ever tried to shoo us away or bring us the check before we asked for it.  I also ordered chili cheese fries which were amazing with the jalapeño cheese. As I was down to the bottom of the plate, our waitress asked if I wanted more of the cheese for dipping! never have I been asked that at a restaurant lol. 

The beer specialties are so awesome, and they offer samples of them all to try before committing to one. Thanks to the help of my waitress, my husband and I each have a new favorite drink :)"

On Friday, I was finally able to check out the new and beloved Brauerhouse at its new and revamped location.  I have to say, I was more than excited to have our favorite bar back in action!

Located right off of 355 on North Ave, it&#39;s a quick and easy drive from just about everywhere.  Like the old place, there&#39;s no big, distinct sign to give away it&#39;s location.  Instead, it&#39;s tucked away in the strip mall near the Red Wing shop.  When you walk in, you&#39;re greeted by an awesome, hand-painted mural in the entry way.  The vibe is rock-n-roll and the interior is bomb!  Seat yourself at one of the booths, tables, or at the bar and enjoy one of the domestic or craft beers on tap... and some shots while you&#39;re at it.

I was highly impressed by the selection of beers.  There were great craft beers on tap, bells hopslam, metropoliton flywheel, stone&#39;s bastard.. etc.. not to mention a ton of bottles!! YUM.  Decently prices and delicious to drink.

Also- this Brauer isn&#39;t just for getting your drink on... there&#39;s FOOD!  Bring your family, kids, friends.. whoever.. and come grab a bite.  Right now, due to its brand new opening, there&#39;s a limited menu.. a handful of delicious burgers, build your own crackercrust pizzas, tater tachos and other foodies! Can&#39;t go wrong with tater tachos!! The food was delicious... got to get the fried snicker for desert!! 

And even better, soon, the menu will be filled with 50 different burgers, crackercrust pizzas, and more!  

As if great beer, a cool vibe, and awesome food wasn&#39;t enough... Brauerhouse also has bad ass bands and music!  Are you in a band?  Looking for a place to play?  You GOT to play here.  Give Steve a call and book a night.  Great sound, cool stage, awesome crowd.. LOVE IT!!

The staff is super awesome... cool and hot chicks.. a young and ambitious kitchen staff.. and owners who are probably the coolest dudes around.  You&#39;ll find them in Brauer at almost all times.. so make sure you say hi and have a shot.

So happy that Brauerhouse is back in action.. great place for families and friends during the early hours.. and for all you party animals at any time of day/night!

I asked her again and she then got what I was asking. $2 drafts.. I asked her what was on tap and she said she didnt know and there is a board that has them. 
We ended up going up to the bar and ordering. Service after that was good. We had the side of tater tots as our appetizer which is cooked in with fish.

I ordered a blueberry wheat beer that I really liked. Wings were half off  and were really good; the BBQ wings was juicy and the sauce had a good, sweet taste. I also ordered a burger, I don&#39;t remember the name, but it had bacon, onions, cheese and of course, a pretzel bun. The burger was just as good as the wing.

We&#39;ve always been curious about this place and decided to give it a try on a Thursday night for an early dinner. My husband and I are not the demographic for this place, but we were treated great by Brittany R- she was such a hard worker and gave us incredible service. Great sense of humor too. 

We loved the decor and also got a kick out of the music. We kept trying to Shazam the songs to hear what they were but I think they were mostly live/independent/non-studio recordings. We did get to hear a ska version of Aha&#39;s Take On Me!

They serve RC products which is quirky but good. My husband found his new favorite beer on draft- New Hollands Dragons Milk. 

We had fried pickles for an appetizer. They were good and were served with a side of ranch. They were different than most places (and super hot- it took forever for them to cool off enough to eat) and were big and well-battered. 

We both got the Lux Interior burgers which are beef and bacon combined in the burger. My husband got it as listed on the menu, with cheddar and jalapenos and thought it was one of the best burgers he&#39;s ever had. He couldn&#39;t finish it and even ate the rest the next day, which says a lot since as you can imagine, burgers reheat a little weird. I got it more plain, and didn&#39;t care for it at all, so my husband ate mine as a leftover too! I tried the tater tots as a side after reading about them on Yelp, and they were pretty good. My husband enjoyed his fries.

They have chocolate covered bacon on their dessert menu and we will definitely give that a try next time. 

I read a lot on Yelp about the pizza, and we were happily surprised that they sell them frozen for you take home, so we bought one (only $5!) and tried it later in the weekend. It didn&#39;t have baking instructions (which I know isn&#39;t hard to figure out but it would have made it easier) but we thought it was really good and the thin crust was delicious.

The burgers here at Brauerhouse are definetely on the greasy side, but the pretzel bun they use is definately up to the task of grease absorbtion.  The burgers are very good, but be forewarned that any changeout on the sides (fries, tots, etc) is an upcharge, which they do not explain to customers (I think on purpose, as enough people complain about it that they can&#39;t be unaware that it&#39;s an issue).  

Of course, i did do takeout, so I only got 5 minutes worth of listening to the metal band playing on a weekend night in a standing-room only crowd.  If that&#39;s not your thing, be aware that this place can get crowded and loud.  And i can absolutely second Sarah S.&#39;s review that they have Dragon&#39;s Milk, which rocks all kinds of ways.  If you ain&#39;t dainty, this is a great place to grab a burger and a beer."

this place is located in a Plaza by KD market and other polish business such as polish credit union etc. 

upon entry place was busy so we sat at the bar, bar area it goes all the way around, staff is supper friendly and atmosphere is very inviting. 

Note that this place is authentic polish so you will hear lots of Polish speaking, no worries they speak English too. staff is super nice.

place is very clean, nice bar with TV to watch sports. 

so, we sat the girl too our orders, and food came at reasonable time. we had soup of the day which was delicious. everything we had was very hommie tasty, we&#39;ll presented and homemade.

we also had some drinks which you get a REAL drink for this price. nice and strong. 

place is super clean, restroom is super clean, only one for everyone UNISEX. 

the decor is rustic super cool, not what you expect for a restaurant located in a Plaza. 

I will definitely return, prices are not bad and portions are big enough to share.

keep up the good work. 

highly recommended!!"

Every time we go to one, we are slighted - and not because we are high-maintenance or asking a ton of questions.  The food here is incredible, but we literally waited FOREVER to place an order and then FOREVER to get a check with little follow-up in between.  The table next to us came in 30 minutes after, were served right away and got their check at the same time - and there were 4 of them and only 2 of us!  We didn&#39;t make any special requests that held things up, who knows?

Anyway, the husband had the sampler platter and it was really good - he loved the mashed potatoes and the cabbage pierogi (you get three of all different variety).  I had the breaded pork tenderloin with mushroom and melted cheese on top - came with the salad plate (yum - I love beets and cucumber and coleslaw!) and ordered the tomato rice soup that was like a gallon!

All was about $50 with drinks, which is super reasonable.  I just wish we weren&#39;t made to feel like we were imposing on the place by just being there!"

I frequent this well-kept strip mall often as Tribalance Yoga is just a few stores down. Like many other shops in this strip mall, Bacowka fairly bland exterior pales in comparison to what I found inside! 

When you step inside, you&#39;ll find a cozy spot with tons of light wood, a very long bar and a decent number of tables. There are three large flatscreens over the bar, too. I met a girlfriend of mine for dinner and while I sunk into my upholstered chair (I felt even shorter than my fun-sized stature), the table was spacious and comfortable. Our server was helpful and direct, and popped in our drink order (wine list is limited, they have a full bar, and a decent beer list) while we waited for our pierogi appetizer. 

The pierogis were nicely textured with bacon bits on top. I preferred the cheese to the meat, but that&#39;s pretty standard for me anyway! Next time I&#39;ll ask for sour cream on the side to add a little something extra to lovely little dumplings. For my meal, I went with the recommended goulash on potato pancakes - a hangover&#39;s dream, IMO. The mountain of goulash topped the crispy potato pancakes and all was blanketed by a flavorful gravy. It was deliciously salty and ridiculously filling. I only ate a portion of it and my husband polished it off for dinner the following day. 

Considering the portion and the, what I assume to be, classic polish menu, Bacowka has made a fan out of me!"

My fiancée and I visited this place a few weeks ago (sorry it took this long to post, but it takes time to write long reviews) and it was amazing. Please read below...

1. From the outside...it might not seem that nice. It looks like it is a small restaurant in some plaza. However once you walk inside the &#34;wow&#34; factor jumps up. It actually is bigger then what you think from the outside. They remodeled it and it extends into another space. It&#39;s super clean and it looks like you walked into a trendy new cabin.

2. This is your stereotypical Chicagoland Polish restaurant. The second you walk in they speak Polish to you. That&#39;s awesome. Just say hello in English and they will speak English to you. 

3. The food is AMAZING and it&#39;s inexpensive. Pierogies, kielbasa, guompki. They got it. 

4. Sports bar is huge and fantastic. Several T.V.&#39;s  

5. Atmosphere is amazing.

If you like culture and believe in diversity and believe in good food then this is the place. Awesome service. Awesome everything. It clearly is the best Polish restaurant in the area."

Cheese &amp; mushroom bread: $6 similar to bruschetta but with ketchup on top. Surprisingly delicious. The bread was perfectly chewy with all the right combination of flavors on top. 

Sampler entree: $15 polish sausage with sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, stuffed cabbage, sample of 3 pierogies, and latkes. Woooowwww everything in this sampler plate was sofa king good! Must have!

Cheese blintz: $6 served warm with cookies and cream ice cream. Delicious!

I wish we had tried this place sooner!  You will be greeted in Polish but just start speaking English &amp; they&#39;ll change over. The menu lists items in Polish but the descriptions are in English so you&#39;ll know what you are ordering.

This is not fast food. Yes, it&#39;s a Polish bar &amp; restaurant but the food is quite elevated from your typical bar food. Do not expect your food to arrive in 5 minutes. You will wait 20 minutes and, by golly, you will be rewarded for your patience.  We decided to share 2 items.  The Moskole, which is described as, &#34;Traditional Highlander Pancake&#34; (insert us doing a &#34;HIGHLANDER&#34; impression) does not do it justice.  It was 3 of what I&#39;m guessing were wheat pancakes, served with &#34;Highlander&#34; cheese (imo sheep&#39;s milk cheese like a ricotta/cream cheese texture with garlic - scrumptious!), cooked cabbage perfectly seasoned w/smoked paprika and some dill-sour cream on the side.  This dish is one of THE best dishes I have ever had at a restaurant. Wowsers.

The second dish we shared was the Kotlet Baca which is a breaded &amp; fried Pork Cutlet topped with mushrooms, cheese, green onions &amp; fried eggs alongside potatoes &amp; various salads. The cutlet was fried just right, not too greasy. The eggs on top were medium sunny-side up &amp; we would have preferred the yolks be runny but never having the dish before we didn&#39;t know what to expect. The potatoes were perfectly sliced &amp; cooked; just the right amount of crispy on the edges. The side salads were an assortment of coleslaw (somewhat bland), pickled cabbage, pickled beets, and dill/sour cream cucumbers - yum! Be aware they don&#39;t offer free refills on soda but they only charge $1.50 for it &amp; since most places charge double that or more for soda we didn&#39;t mind so much. 

The food took about 20 minutes to come out, but I would expect that based on the menu. Since the location is a popular bar some people may expect faster food, but that is not the case with a better menu such as theirs. It did take a while for the server to take our order and then quite a bit of time to get our check so the speed of the service, outside of the food prep itself, is my only negative.  They have plenty of staff and 3 different people checked on us. Had it not been for that I would have actually given them 5 stars."

While soup did come out soon, the wait for entrees was extremely long, an hour per the clock. We ordered breaded pork chops that should have come with side salads which they didn&#39;t bring out until we inquired about.

The pork chops came with fried potatoes, and both items were so extremely dry and fried, as it they had fried them in old oil. I&#39;ve had my fair share of Polish breaded pork chops and these were by far worst. Basically unedible except for maybe the fourth I ate because I was hungry.

We let them know, and servers were really nice and offered to get us something else, but at that point we were full enough and not feelin like eating more of such food. 

Skip it."

If this is your first time eating Polish food, then maybe you will enjoy it. However, I&#39;m surprised at how many Polish people came here for food, especially when it is not fresh at all. I came in with 4 other people for some Sunday dinner. The place is pretty small and it was packed. 

From what we ordered, the kompot, rosol, and zapiekanka were good. The zapiekanka was toasted too much, as in it was a deep brown color. Would have been better if it was toasted properly. Besides this, everything else was a serious disappointment. They serve you the food on large plates, and the meat will take up most of the plate. What they do is pound out the meat so much that it becomes wide and flat, hence making it seem like you are getting a lot of food. Newsflash &#34;Bacowka&#34; owners, we can tell you do this. And it seriously ruins the quality of the meat. 

My grilled chicken was chewy and didn&#39;t have any seasoning. The kotlety were deep fried to a crisp, or more like a damn crunch. This is something I&#39;ve never experienced while eating polish food made by my parents, relatives, friends, in Poland, and in Polish restaurants in Chicago. The fries were not fully cooked, for both of the two plates that they came with. Like raw potatoes with you dinner? And how can you even mess up coleslaw? I had a few bites and couldn&#39;t eat it, plus I&#39;m not a picky eater. The person in our group who ordered the potato pancakes with gulasz ate only 1/4 of it, and didn&#39;t take the rest home. Oh, and the grilled oscypek with zurawina.. yeah the cheese had a &#34;gummy&#34; texture and the jam came straight from a jar.

I&#39;m suprised this place has such a high rating, which is the only reason we came here. My advice is to go to the nearest Polish deli and order some hot meals from behind the counter. Would probably taste better than this food which is not fresh at all. Or drive 15 minutes from here and go to &#34;U Gazdy&#34; where you can get properly cooked, and flavorful food. Your chicken or kotlet won&#39;t be pounded out like theres no tomorrow. 1/5, the prices are pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for. Oh well, lesson learned."

It&#39;s in a strip mall in Schaumburg but was easy to find.  We walked in and were immediately greeted by one of two employees.  She told us to have a seat anywhere, there was only one other patron at the restaurant when we arrived (Sunday around 3:30).  It isn&#39;t a big place, there are probably 6 tables and 3 bar stools.  Their tables and chairs are so awesome, they are made of really hardy, heavy wood. We ordered 5 cheese pierogi and 5 meat pierogi to start.  They came out about 10 minutes later piping hot.  We all preferred the meat but they were both excellent!!  I ordered the Goulash which I would highly recommend. It had so much flavor and they give you so much! I took at least 1/2 home.  My daughter ordered the meat dumplings over cabbage, they brought out 3 of them, they were about the size of a baseball.  My son ordered potato pancakes with applesauce, also fantastic. My hubby got the pork cutlet with mushrooms and a bunch of different salads. Most were really tasty and the pork was super tender.  By the time we left the place was packed and there were about 15 people waiting for a table.  Since we&#39;d never been to a polish restaurant before it&#39;s hard for me to say how authentic it was but the fact that we were the only patrons that didn&#39;t  speak polish definitely  says something!!"

Saw the restaurant on yelp and gave it a try. The perogies and kielbasa were excellent. I had the breaded pork cutlet, with mushrooms. The menu is in both English and Polish, and had several polish families. 
The five of us with 2 beers and two white wines, the total bill came to $77.00. 
Must be doing well there are expanding to include the space next door."

it is a super tiny location. I think there are maybe 7 tables and a small counter that 3-4 people can sit at. They aimed for a rustic decor-wood tables and chairs, that is successful and homey.
But it&#39;s the food that is a standout. It&#39;s a typical menu for poland or germany, but isn&#39;t  necessarily common here. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve been disappointed with anything I&#39;ve ordered. I don&#39;t normally eat polish sausage in restaurants-there is a polish grocery that shares the parking lot, and if you have good quality polish sausage available it&#39;s the simplest possible dish to make at home, yet this place makes it better then I can. The tenderloin and pancakes are standouts, as are the Pierogi. 
The Pierogi. Oh my god. The combinations of textures and flavors is superb. The chewy firmness of the dough, instantly replaced with the explosion of meat coupled with the cold crunch of cabbage, with just a drizzle of olive oil for a liquid feel.
Every dish here is an event to savor.
European cuisine can be criticized as being focused on the meat component but here every dish is very well balanced out, being matched with a vegetable component. you are not having a meat or veg dish, you are having a MEAL, complete with both. the balancing of the portions is well, exquisite. 
Regional polish beer, herbal tea, and upon occasion grzaniec (mulled wine) are available as drinks, and can make delightful pairings with the food. If you chose a soda it will be a bottle or can-there is no soda fountain.
Parking is unlimited-this is sizable strip mall with a huge parking lot Since the resturant so small the service is perfect. If the waitress isn&#39;t within line of sight, it&#39;s because she&#39;s in the kitchen helping the cook and/or getting your order. Even when all the tables are occupied, it still manages  to feel cozy rather then crowded."

one other small to tidbit. my boyfriend ordered the pork shop and they brought him the sampler platter.no big deal that he got the wrong food happens a lot of places the fact that they questioned what he ordered instead of apologizing what&#39;s a little unusual.
now those pierogis were amazing. I ordered  sampler platter and next time I&#39;m going to order takeout a huge order of the pierogis.
 I thought the pirk chop my boyfriend ordered was good, was deep fried which was unusual for me. his concern was that it tasted like fish so I think they deep-fried the pork chop in the same oil as the fish. He doesn&#39;t like fish.
if you are looking for authentic this is the place. I think we were the only ones that did not speak Polish.
I will definitely go back for takeout probably will not eat in just because of where the table was located."

I will say I do regret not actually eating at the restaurant cause it is such a beautiful restaurant inside! They have these cool animal hides for backing of the booths that looked really unique and cool. A lot of wood, which I tend to like, was an art form with beautiful pictures up on the walls. Now to the food! I ordered the sampler plate and I was not disappointed! The potato pancake was crispy and flavorful! The sausage had a nice snap to it with a spicy inside which was really nice along with the mashed potatoes with that lovely tomato sauce(very similar to Greek tomato sauce). Then of course the pierogis were delicious but my favorite things were the braised cabbage and cabbage rolls! Man were those good! Overall great start and I will defnilty be going there again!"

There was one table left out of 5, I believe.  By the time we were being served a short time later, there were 3 sets of families waiting on a table.  
Service was good and without hesitation.  The food tasted great.  A little different than my mother&#39;s and grandmother&#39;s but tasty nevertheless.  My wife had the goulash platter which she enjoyed.

Bacowka is a tiny little restaurant that doesn&#39;t get nearly as much traffic as it should.  Wedged into a tiny corner of the strip mall on Roselle, Bacowka is hard to spot but keep at it until you find it, because it&#39;s a small gem.

Having eaten meals in a Polish household, I can only imagine that the kitchen is essentially someone&#39;s home.  At times you can even hear the chef pounding out the chicken as it&#39;s made for your meal.  All the food here seems to harken back to the experience-trained cooking of generations.  In a number of trips, the Gołąbki (cabbage rolls), pork goulash, pierogi, and everything else have all been cooked perfectly.

For vegetarians, while meat-heavy Eastern Europe can be daunting (and definitely is on display here) there are actually quite a few choices that easily fit the bill from the potato pancakes, to pierogi (make sure to request no bacon - that was somewhat painful to type) and great sides including coleslaw, amazing dill potatoes, and cucumber or beet salads.

The interior complements the home cooked feeling with a mountain cabin feel.  The tables and chairs have been crafted from slabs of wood which match the rustic log walls bear skin rug.  Even the mismatched silverware here doesn&#39;t detract but just continues to add to the feeling that you might just be in someone&#39;s home.

The prices here are really a steal.  A filling meal can be had for $6-8 and if you&#39;re feeling exceptionally hungry, the combination plate with a little of almost everything checks in at nearly $15. 

As pretty much the only Polish restaurant in Schaumburg, this one is a unique but definite winner."

We have only been here once, and it was right as they were closing.  We were a little worried as we thought we had gotten there over an hour before closing.  They had already started breaking down and cleaning up for the night, but insisted that we come in and order dinner.  We were the only ones there, but were not rushed by any means.  The staff was absolutely awesome!  

The food was abundant and delicious to top it off.  We ordered some pierogies to start with, which were to cooked perfectly.  I had the pork cutlet and she had the potato pancakes.  Both of our entries were very large and we wound up bringing some home with us.

We will definitely be back here!"

Kraut and mushroom Pierogies were some of the best we&#39;ve had... Skin not too doughy...thin, slightly chewy... And tossed with a bit of bacon and onions.  Being a flaczky ( tripe soup) junkie, I had to order a bowl... Came out in a surprisingly large bowl with slices of rye bread to dip into it!  Soup had a great slightly smokey flavor and was filled with tender strips of tripe!  The potato pancakes with goulash was super cozy.. The crisp think potato pancakes enveloped this amazingly moist, tender chunks of meat... All smothered in a gravy-ish sauce...wow!  

Inside if the restaurant was cute!  Like a little cozy log cabin!  Not usually into that lodge-y type look but it worked in this case... Totally adorable!  Clean interior and the waitress was super friendly and polite!

The authentic polish food they serve was DELICIOUS and I thought the prices were very reasonable...$30 for 2 people (no booze)

They have only 5 tables in the entire restaurant so you might be waiting a long time on a Saturday night.  But the food was delicious.  If they added some polish ham and rye bread to the sampler platter, I would have been in heaven.

Bacowka is a charmingly decorated and seemingly authentic Polish restaurant just minutes away from home. Pine walls, tables, and ridiculously heavy chairs complete with bar chairs with fur throws and a bear skin on the wall really sets the mood despite the utterly mundane area of Schaumburg this gem is located at. 

We ordered the obligatory potato and cheese pierogies, kielbasa, and potato pancakes with beef goulash.  The pierogies were fresh and were topped with chewy bits of bacon. If you&#39;re a fan of sour cream with your pierogies the you&#39;ll have to ask for a side of it because ours didn&#39;t come with it. It was a request easily filled at no extra charge. I&#39;m still a noob when it comes to Polish food but I thought these pierogies were certainly above average and satisfied my ever nagging craving for those tasty little Polish dumplings.

The kielbasa came grilled, split in half lengthwise and topped with kraut served with a few pieces of bread and ketchup and mustard for dipping. I thought the ketchup and mustard was a little strange but we went with it. The ketchup ruined the smokey goodness of the sausage for me but just a hint of the plain yellow mustard helped to break up any flavor monotony.

The star of the show was by far the potato pancakes absolutely smothered in that rich beef goulash. Wow, I couldn&#39;t get enough of the stuff. It was served with two pickle spears to break up the richness of the goulash, I&#39;m assuming. Pure comfort food right there and I&#39;m sure that this will be my staple dish here.

Service was polite but not overbearing... just the way I like it.

We were the only couple here on a Friday night but 2 more couples came in as we were finishing up.  This place is tiny and can fill up quick so I was surprised to see such a lack of clientele at this time.  They just opened up 3 months ago, according to our waitress, so maybe people don&#39;t know about this place yet.

I really enjoyed the food here as it was reasonably priced with portions that matched the price and the quality was great. I hope business picks up for them because I&#39;m so glad to have a place like this so close to home. Another great place to add to the growing Schuamburg list!"

I am fortunate in that I have had some amazing meal experiences of various different kind of food. This was one of those amazing dining experiences. 

The restaurant itself is a quaint, little place in a strip mall. The furniture is as unique as the food, wooden tables and chairs (very comfortable), there is a large beautiful photo of a meadow in Poland that has a mountain range in the background. On the opposite wall is a Black Bear skin.

I was waited on by two beautiful women who were very gracious, welcoming, attentive and helpful. I tried an authentic Polish beer and it was very good, my meal was a breaded pork loin covered in mushrooms and cheese, with sliced fried potatoes and four small salads, cucumber, red cabbage, a sauerkraut like salad and a salad that resembled coleslaw.

It&#39;s so nice to have good Polish cuisine in the area.  We had Highlander Pancakes, goulash, sauerkraut soup, cheese with cranberry sauce, and pierogis, it was all great!  We also had a dessert of waffles topped with strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate drizzle, and that was definitely a wise choice.  The interior of the restaurant was very woodsy and charming.  Not a ton of seating as the place is fairly small, but there are a few fur-lined bar seats and several LARGE tables."

Very delicious food, friendly atmosphere and very good prices. They serve traditional polish highlander foods cooked to perfection. The interior is beautiful, with a polish highlander cabin atmosphere. It is very small space and gets pretty crowded so it&#39;s best come between lunch and dinner. All the foods are delicious but i highly recommend the Hungarian potato pancake with beef goulash or the traditional highlander pancakes. Their dessert options are both to die for too!!

Overall, very good service, friendly atmosphere, delicious food all at great prices!! :)"

You owe it to your taste buds and appetite to get here.  Every dish was authentic, made with care and showed the passion they have for quality meals.  Our family had the pickle soup, borscht, pierogis, golabki, and placki ziemniaczane, with blueberry pierogis with sweet cream for dessert. This was by far the best meal this family has had in years.

No water offered, tiny napkins, no decaf coffee and they also have no website.  With only about six tables, they don&#39;t want to take reservations.

My husband and I live very near and decided to try this new place. We had received a menu in the mail and it looked good. I had the Red Borscht soup with dumplings. It was served in a huge bowl. Clear gorgeous broth and meat filled dumplings with the most wonderful flavor. We also ordered the cheese &amp; potato pierogies. They came with onions and bacon. So delightfully light and tender. Hubby and I both had the Hungarian Potato Pancakes with Beef Goulash. Oh. My. Goodness. First of all the food was hot. I mean really hot. It stayed hot the entire meal. You just don&#39;t find that in a restaurant these days. The pancakes were crispy on the edges and so fluffy. The meat was fall apart tender; like butter. The sauce with vegetables, cheese and fresh green onions complimented the dish perfectly. The pickle spears lent a refreshing balance to the meal. I ordered coffee and Sylvia brought it out in a huge charming bowl reminiscent of the huge mugs they drank coffee out of in the show &#34;Friends&#34;. The most wonderful touch was the homemade whipped cream which she added because she just knew I would like it. So delicious and a wonderful end to the meal. You just don&#39;t find old world charm like this, especially in the suburbs. Like other reviewers said, it is very small. The furniture is sturdy, huge and looks finely crafted. The cabin atmosphere with the fur backed barstools and bear skin on the wall lent a cozy feel to the warm comforting homey ambiance. Absolutely love this place! We will be back many times. A true neighborhood gem!"

It&#39;s just an enjoyable combination of lively surroundings, beers and burgers. And of course their unlimited fries (which I never get more of because I&#39;m usually too stuffed).

One time when I was there I decided to try something different and so I went for their teriyaki burger.  It has pineapples and cheese and teriyaki sauce.  It&#39;s is such a great combination of flavors that the only other thing I try when I go there is their teriyaki chicken.  It&#39;s like the burger except with a chicken breast between the buns.

The place is usually packed during meal time though they do seem to turn people around quickly.  When I&#39;ve waited for a table, the most it took was about 20 minutes.  The last time I went it was very busy so I opted for Kinfork across the parking lot.  But as good as their burger was, it wasn&#39;t as good as Red Robin&#39;s."

I most recently came for my husband&#39;s b-day and I tried setting up a reservation, but they don&#39;t take them. Still, when I called on a Monday to book for that Tuesday, they said they could set aside space for 15 of us. However, when we showed up, they had no record of the conversation taking place, though I am sure that I called this location and I spoke with someone who kept putting me on hold and seemed to be checking with another employee about the request. They had a suspicion that another employee who wasn&#39;t there spoke with a manager who wasn&#39;t scheduled either and they failed to notify the next day&#39;s crew. Nonetheless, the place was practically empty, they apologized profusely, and they seated us in no time.

Our server Alejandro was on top of everything. He kept coming by to check on us and make sure people had what they asked for or we got to place extra orders as needed. They let us take our time and we were able to split up the bill easily with their table kiosks. With 15 people, that was greatly needed and appreciated. It really took the guess work out of separating who had what so people could pay quickly when they were ready to leave at various points throughout the evening.

This isn&#39;t my favorite place for burgers and fries, but it is a top contender for large events such as this. Aside from the scheduling mix-up, which is understandable since they don&#39;t even take reservations to begin with, they&#39;ve been reliable when we&#39;ve come and they are affordable. I would highly recommend them for a casual party or family outing because the menu had a little something for everyone who had preferences or dietary restrictions among our friends - kids to adults, meat lovers to vegetarians or chicken-centric, and then some!

I normally would get a burger here but was feeling like I wanted something lighter and went with the Marco Pollo Chicken Burger, which still finds a way to pack in the calories. Regardless, it was fabulous. So, I can vouch for the beef and the chicken! You can&#39;t really go wrong with bottomless fries and there are different kinds from which to chose. They have tons of side options and appetizers, drinks and desserts. Easy peasy!"

I loved it as a teen (when I first started going there) and now, I will always remember it as my husband&#39;s and my first date spot when we first started dating. Their burgers are phenomenal, and who can argue against bottomless fries? The freckled lemonade is so delicious and refreshing, albeit a little pricey. The best option is to order a burger with the bottomless fries and split it. The burgers are huge and you&#39;ll end up really full after the bottomless fries anyway. 

Side note: This place is great for kids. Go for your next family outing!"

Ive found the male servers here are usually better and more attentive than the female ones. 

This is very much so a family restaurant. If you go later in the evening you can avoid most of the crying children lol 

The menu is pretty extensive and the bottomless fries/salad + free substitutions are pretty amazing.

Always ask for a booth as the middle tables just have way too much traffic going past.

I have now been to this location 4 times and ALL four times I&#39;ve experienced a problem and left unsatisfied every time! The food is FANTASTIC but the service is ridiculous. My only complaint about the food is that we were not given the option to say how we wanted our food prepared. My boyfriend was unsatisfied with his burger and said it tasted charred when he prefers it medium well.

Our server seemed to only be attentive when we were paying the bill! I had to ask to get a refill on my fries and we were only given one refill on the fries when we asked for 3 as there was three in our party. Anytime she came to the table she would say &#34;everything ok?&#34; Rather than &#34;can I get you anything&#34; which is how a server is supposed to phrase it! Her asking if everything was ok seemed to me like her way of getting out of getting us anything. 

We went for their Veterans Day special because my boyfriend is a veteran. Their new system with paying with the kiosks is annoying and hard to figure out when you have multiple people paying and you have to put in your rewards card and redeem a reward. 

When we asked for the manager they came quickly which was nice however it took 3 tries for them to fix the bill which the server never fixed in the first place so we could all pay separately. (She also never asked how we wanted the bill to look) 

This was just one experience. I&#39;m never going back to this location"

As for the services our server was very nice but it took almost 15 minutes for chips and salsa appetizer to arrive. We were also not given any silverware or napkins after the chips and salsa arrived.

Our burger was cooked well and tasted good, although our server never even asked how we would like it cooked. I had eaten half of the burger before our server even came by to check on us.

We asked for more of the bottomless sweet potato fried and were told it would be 4 minutes and it was over 10.

The food was delicious but this three star rating is because of the worse than average service. We saw more people dealing with getting people to their seats then bussers and the servers seemed over taxed. Would like to see more bus and serve staff."

This location is a zoo during the weekends. There&#39;s always a line out the door, so be prepared to wait. During the week, you&#39;ll have no problem, and if you work in the mall, you get a little discount.

The bar is nice, with a TV playing local sporting events, and the bartenders have been consistently friendly and attentive.

The only reason this place is not 5 stars is because they used to value mall employees business and promotion of their restaurant by giving extra fries to go, to share with our co-workers. While I do understand that there is a bottom line, I wish the management would understand that when we bring fries back to our stores, it encourages our co-workers to have lunch at RR.

I would like to say the Deer Park location is awesome. The Woodfield location is a completely different story. Where should I begin? The place is filthy, possible health code violations. There was food all over the floor/seats. The bathroom was very dirty as well. There were 3 of us at the table and they brought 2 forks, 2 knives and 2 napkins. We started off by ordering 3 waters with lemon and a freckled lemonade. He brings the water with no lemon. Then it took about 15 minutes to get him to come back and ask if we were ready to order. We again asked for lemons for our water. We had also asked for another set of silverware and more napkins. He never brought them so we walked over to the bar and asked the bar tender who was able to get them to us immediately. Finally, our waiter came back with the lemon slices and we put in our orders. 
When our orders arrived mine and my mom&#39;s orders were wrong. They sent them back and brought them back a second time. My order had been corrected but they still brought out the incorrect order for my mom. She had ordered broccoli as her side instead of fries. All three times they brought her order they brought fries. We finally flagged down a manager since our waiter was nowhere to be found. He said it would be right out. It took about 10 minutes and they brought it to her. Once we started eating our waiter who had been MIA for a while came and asked how things were. My boyfriend&#39;s response was &#34;eh, it&#39;s alright..&#34; so that our waiter would know we have not been too happy with the service so far. Our waiter laughed and said &#34;okay&#34; and walked away. We were all shocked that he didn&#39;t even ask what was wrong or what could be done to make the experience better. 
As everyone knows RR is known for their unlimited side dishes. We had ordered fries and broccoli. Our waiter never came back to ask if we would like more. He came over to ask if we needed dessert or anything else. We put in multiple orders of our sides at that time since we knew he probably wouldn&#39;t come back to check on us for another 20 minutes if not longer. If you&#39;re going to have bottomless items on the menu, it shouldn&#39;t take half an hour to get a new one. Also, it took forever just to get a refill on our waters. We shouldn&#39;t have to flag you down or ask multiple times for more water. If you aren&#39;t going to be attentive leave a pitcher of water at our table. 
Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location. I have given this location a few tries and every time it seems to get worse. Deer Park will be my go to location from now on."

Needless to say I was worried about the time (we sat down an hour til the show started!), but service was fast.

I wish I got the name of our server - he was fun, but really speedy and continued to check in on us without hovering. He also gave us directions to the Improv, which ended up being super helpful!

I got the Garden (veggie) Burger, and my +1 got the Bleu Ribbon Burger. He said his was good. My patty was really disappointing since it was undercooked - it was very pale and mushy when it should have a good crispiness or sear on it. Next time I&#39;ll try the cod. I wish they offered non-fried fish options!

You can&#39;t get your bottomless fries BEFORE your burger comes out, but they oblige afterwards. There&#39;s a $1.50 upcharge for sweet potato fries, but they&#39;re yummy! Our speedy server got us hot fry refills very quickly - both kinds, thankyouverymuch.

I&#39;m still surprised we had time to eat our burgers AND indulge in 2x bottomless fry orders within the hour AND we were on time for the show. Oh, and the directions our server gave us prevented me from flipping my ish (since being late = anxiety).

Score. We&#39;ll be back."

First off, we waited to be waited on and our server darted past us saying she&#39;d get to us. Time goes the hostess approaches us to ask if we&#39;ve been helped . . no, but she did eventually arrive to our table. We were given forks with lettuce stuck to them which could be easily forgiven if everything just went smoothly from there, but unfortunately they didn&#39;t. Our server forgot my water and never got my wedge of lemon which I didn&#39;t even bother asking for. We were given the wrong shake and had to flag someone else to correct it, which was fine since they corrected it after some discussion. They forgot straw so we ask. They forgot my sauce for my bottomless fries, so had to give another reminder there. 

Along that note, I had asked for bottomless fries and literally was given a scant amount with my burger. So of course I had to ask for more. Our server passed over us several times without asking if we were okay. It seemed she went to everyone else&#39;s table to check on them, but ours which seemed kind of weird to us since we really weren&#39;t giving anyone issues despite what was happening. Had to get her attention and she said she&#39;d give me refills for my water and fries . . . let&#39;s say it was a while till we got them and my friend said when she looked our way she kind of had that &#34;o yea. . &#34; look about her, which we then finally got our items. Also, they hadn&#39;t explained the kiosk properly to us as I hadn&#39;t ever used one before and didn&#39;t seem too keen to stick around long enough to see if we needed help with it. I mean the whole time it was a short response, turn and go. 

We were just in a bad spot? Don&#39;t know. Yes things could have been a lot worse and I understand if it gets busy, but from our perspective it wasn&#39;t a good one."

Food: I got the famous Red Robbin Burger with fries. The burger was fine, nothing special, but at least it was real beef! 
My bf had a piece of metal in his fish batter, however the manager took care of this issue and didn&#39;t charge him for his meal.

We were basically avoided the whole time we were there. Our server kept saying they were busy, but had time to go to every other table, except ours. I&#39;m not sure what we could have done wrong?? The only time he was attentive was when he was giving us the check &amp; picking it up.... We didn&#39;t even have to ask for that.

If you&#39;re gonna have bottomless items on the menu, it shouldn&#39;t take half an hour to get a new one. 

My cousin got the broccoli &amp; the first time it was steamed nicely. The second time, not so much. The server said they boil it really quick, but they were dry and raw. They seemed to have been microwaved for a few seconds. Yet, they took forever to come out. I don&#39;t understand.

Also, I wanted garlic parmesan fries, thinking they&#39;d be fresh crushed garlic &amp; parmesan tossed with the fries... but nope, they use garlic powder! What a disappointment!  Do not order this, ever! 

Other than that, the appetizers and burgers were good. We got the cheese sticks, tower of onion rings, and fried zucchini. Burgers we got were sautéed shroom and the big pig out. I appreciated that the apps came out super fresh. That&#39;s really the only thing keeping me from giving one star. 

You can get a good burger anywhere else, but these were still pretty decent. It seems like a hit or miss whenever I come here. Sometimes I like the burgers, sometimes I don&#39;t.

I&#39;ve noticed the service at this location sucks more than the other Red Robin locations I&#39;ve been at. I wonder why?"

We were thinking that since we were meeting on a Tuesday, we would have pretty quick service.  It took about 15 minutes for us to even place a drink order.  However, the food was pretty good!  Our food came out relatively fast and our drinks kept us occupied. 

I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich - I do not recommend.  There was barely any sauce on the chicken, the chicken was basically the same thing as you get from a McDonald&#39;s grilled chicken sandwich, and the pineapple that came on it was 100% canned.  I was not expecting a 5 star chicken sandwich, but I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting what I received.  We also had to prompt our waiter for the bottomless fries.  We were under the impression that we would receive them as soon as we placed out order and then it would be replenished ever so often by the waiter.  We received one tray of fries and that was it between all three of us :("

I dragged my boyfriend here because I hadn&#39;t been to a Red Robin in a while, and I don&#39;t remember what all the fuss what about. After coming here, I still don&#39;t. 

We came on a very busy Sunday afternoon, so we didn&#39;t expect lightning-fast service. But surprisingly, we got it. Our server, Shannon, was dead tired, but made sure that she took very good care of us. We never had to ask her for refills or flag her down for the check. She rocks. 

The service is great. The food is just okay. It wasn&#39;t terrible, and I could eat it again if I weren&#39;t paying so much for it. The meat was similar to Wendy&#39;s, and without the toppings, it lacked flavor.  The bottomless fries were okay, but the Campfire sauce makes them awesome. Tangy, creamy, and yummy. 

All things considered, I&#39;d probably come back to Red Robin again, but I won&#39;t rush. I&#39;ve had better burgers elsewhere."

Yes, there are certainly other burger champions in Chicago but the great thing that I love about Red Robin is that there are no rules or stipulations. It&#39;s simply quality food with great service. You also won&#39;t find any French cheeses with odd pronunciations here. The burgers here have the right bun to meat ratio unlike other places where the burger comes out like the shape of the roman numeral one.

For me, the Blue Ribbon Burger continues to be my favorite - blue cheese, steak sauce, and fried onion straws. It&#39;s the perfect combination of strong flavors and textures.

As a food fanatic from the &#34;actual&#34; city of Chicago, there are a plenty of burger joints that can surpass the taste and quality of Red Robin.  However, I&#39;m still a semi-regular to Red Robin because of the perks they have with their loyalty program.  To be honest, there are a number of items that I recommend: A1 peppercorn and blue cheese burgers.  Let&#39;s talk in depth about the loyalty program.  Every burger you order, it&#39;s one (1) point accumulated.  Every 10th burger is free and you can get a free burger on the month of your birthday.  Occasionally, they will load coupons onto your loyalty card and it entices me to pay a visit to the restaurant.  The service is always decent as my husband and I are, for the most part, self-sufficient as customers.  Tonight I ordered the Loyal Red Robin burger.  The only I didn&#39;t&#39; like as much was the bun.  It was too soft to hold up the ingredients in between.

What is it with this Red Robin having a bunch of hot female waitresses? Super weird! I digress... Our waitress was great. Brought me balloons for my birthday because I&#39;m a big winner and they all came out and sang me Happy Bday plus gave me a free sundae. I was so stuffed that I gave it to my coworker but still, a great choice for a bday lunch because of all the goodies!

I ordered the Mint Brownie shake and in all truth it was so filling I couldn&#39;t even touch my burger and fries. The shake was fabulous! How can it go wrong with mint chocolate chip ice cream and chunks of brownie inside? Honestly, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible. I had the leftover burger and fries for dinner tonight. They have some great honey mustard...it&#39;s a bit different then other places but man it&#39;s good. Their fries are always just okay but in house they are all you can eat which is nice &amp; fun.

Now, it&#39;s just whatever. The prices have gone up and the service is a lot worse. They&#39;re always busy which is a good sign I guess but they definitely aren&#39;t the same. 
For example, today I came with a group of ten people. We were next on the list but a group of 17 got seated before us. They basically &#34;assign&#34; the full tables to the groups waiting instead of first come first serve. So if one group finishes before the table assigned to yours is, they sit first. The manager didn&#39;t seem apologetic at all and neither were the employees. Great service guys.. We left and the manager came to us in the hall and offered free appetizers, after all we waited almost an hour which was about thirty mins more than they had told us and seated people before us.. It was an attempt to make up for it, but honestly we didn&#39;t want to try to look for another restaurant and wait again. I&#39;m glad the manager eventually tried to make it up to us and made it seem like our business mattered unlike the other employee who just rolled her eyes at us. Which made this review two stars instead of three."

My son says it&#39;s his fourth best cheeseburger. My oldest likes the decor at this Red Robin location. My wife appreciates the bottomless sweet potato fries. And I enjoy the convenience of the location being attached to Woodfield Mall.

Isn&#39;t that how all Red Robin reviews should start?  I feel like every time I say or hear someone say &#34;Reeeeed Robin&#34; I have to respond with &#34;yummmmm.&#34;

My mom and I went to Red Robin last week after spending too much time at the mall where she got to buy a lot of cute things and I was broke-as-a-joke and couldn&#39;t buy anything.  

Anyway, after her spree we were both pretty hungry and didn&#39;t want to risk waiting for a table at Cheesecake Factory.

I hadn&#39;t been to a Red Robin in years.  The burger section of the menu was significantly smaller than I remember, but the other items (fish &amp; chicken sandwiches, entrees) seemed to have grown.

The burger was as I remembered it (I had the one with bleu cheese, chipotle bbq, and onion strings) and my mom tasted a new menu item, the cajun salmon sandwich.

Overall, everything was good.  We had to wait for refills, ketchup, and extra sauces a bit longer than I would have liked, but not a bad experience."

The food was good, but the service was absolutely outstanding. My daughter did not like her meal and the server went out of his way to get her something else free of charge.

The great service was not just from our waiter, another guy that I&#39;d guess was the manager also was checking on us after he found out about my daughter&#39;s meal and was super friendly and helpful.

I could go on and on, but all I have to say is WOW."

If you just want a basic (cheese)burger and fries, which I did, then you should head to Portillo&#39;s.  If you want something more fancy then go to Red Robin. I&#39;m not a fan of the &#34;endless fries&#34; here. You get a very small portion at first, and unless you really TRY to inhale the fries first, you probably won&#39;t get or need a second portion before you&#39;re finished or need a box for your burger. Of course this was me, and I felt like I did not get my money&#39;s worth. The fries are also a little too fat and mashy (?) in the middle for my tastes.  I like thinner fries that aren&#39;t as soft. Service here was great. Overall, I&#39;d give a 3.5 stars if that was an option."

The hosts greeted us with a smile and quickly seated us at a nice table in the middle of the restaurant.  It wasn&#39;t too busy and to me, it seemed as if she really understood that this table was exactly where she should place a small family (3 adults + a 12 yr old).  The hosted told us the waitress would be right there and within a few minutes, Ashley came and introduced herself.  She had a smile on her face and was friendly welcoming.  She asked if we had been to a RR before and for those of us who hadn&#39;t she made sure to sound especially gracious and welcoming.  

We ordered the onion rings as an appetizer and they were amazing.  They were not greasy and the batter was flavored just right.  I personally didn&#39;t use the ranch dressing or the bbq-mayo dipping sauces but the rest of my family loved them.  Ashley was attentive and brought our drinks in a timely manner.  She was even nice enough to deal with my sister-in-law who is picky about her choices.  She had Ashley switch her drink from flavored tea to regular tea to sprite and Ashley never made a face or complained.  Instead she was very accommodating and insisted that it was &#34;no problem&#34;.  

I had the Tavern burger &#34;cry baby&#34; style.  I too am picky about what I eat so I asked Ashley to have them make mine with just lettuce, onions and the pepper ketchup.  My sister-in-law got a chicken salad and my brother got a chicken wrap.  My nephew also ate a chicken burger.  Everyone loved their meal, but I was absolutely blown away at how the burger was made exactly to my request.  From the first bite, I knew we had made a great decision.  The crunchy onions, sauteed onions and the pepper ketchup combined well to give it just the right amount of crunch and kick to the burger.  I couldn&#39;t wait to get my second bite of the burger and when I did, it was like heaven.  

My family who had eaten at a RR before thought I was joking when I kept telling them how much I was enjoying the burger.  I couldn&#39;t even talk sometimes as I kept eating and eating bite after bite.  I just wanted to savor the flavors again and again.  The endless steak fries were good but they could be a little less seasoned.  

The service at this RR was so great, I made it a point to talk to the manager (forgot his name, sorry) to let him know how impressed I was with the service and the quality of food.  I didn&#39;t tell him that I noticed he held a meeting with his staff, but now that I think about it; that is probably why they have great service.  

Kudos to this RR and to the leadership team and staff.  I would highly recommend this Red Robin and I would definitely come back again and again.  Now, I can&#39;t wait to try the RR near my home in California.  I hope they impress me too!"

I tried the BBQ chicken wrap and it had a lot of taste to it. Make sure to get the camp fire sauce for the fries. It&#39;s not spicy tastes like BBQ and chipotle mixed together. Hamburgers you can&#39;t go wrong on any one of those since they all taste really good.

Red Robin, not too shabby.  I ate my whole burger and my whole portion of fries.  I honestly can&#39;t remember the last time I did that. I think I was able to conquer this feat because one, the meal was a good size AND two, I was freakin&#39; hungry!  At any rate, it was scrumptious and I enjoyed it.  

I had the guacamole and bacon burger.  They loaded a ton of guac and a ton of crispy and thick bacon.  Who ever thought of this combo is a genius. My burger was cooked to a nice medium and my fries were great.  FYI: I suggest the seasoning salt on the table.

Well, if you can get pass the exuberant amount of decorations and the occasional outburst of happy birthday singalongs, this is a solid place for burgers (and endless fries).  I know I&#39;ve been been pretty snobby with other burger places, but I&#39;m stepping down my high horse and saying good job Red Robin, good job."

As far as chain restaurants go, I would put it at the higher end in terms of quality. But the main reason I&#39;m reviewing this location in Woodfield is to talk about how good the customer service is, along with the kid&#39;s meals.

We&#39;ve all heard that the teens and twentysomethings of today&#39;s generation are supposed to be pre-occupied with texting their friends on the Twitter and all that, but every single time I&#39;ve taken my family to this location, no matter how busy and hectic this place is (and during the holiday&#39;s it&#39;s a madhouse) the hosts and servers at this location are always attentive, courteous and fast. 

Also, if you have to take your kid to a chain restaurant, especially in a place like Woodfield, you really can&#39;t find a better selection of kid&#39;s meals. There&#39;s lots of healthy options for little ones, and they are tasty enough that your kid will actually want to eat them. And you might actually want to finish what they don&#39;t. I mean, I don&#39;t vulture on my kids food at all, but you might want to.

Really good customer service, the best kids meals around, and they have Coke Zero in the fountain, which always gets extra credit from me."

But we&#39;re sat at a table and we&#39;re greeted by the most friendly waiter. That&#39;s what really sells me on this location, we got quick, fast service, by a guy who from what I can tell, really enjoys his job.

Every time we come here, there are happy parents and their happy offspring putting away mouthfuls of food. Unlike some other Red Robin locations, though, the staff here seems to know how to organize high chairs and such to prevent a huge clog in the aisles. They even have birthday parties with balloons and other swag. I predict a lot of visits to this place in my future once my little one is big enough for a high chair herself. The staff here will not give you the stink eye because your kid drops a piece of food--they expect that and understand that your child might also leave little ketchup fingerprints on the table. It&#39;s clearly so popular with families for a reason.

The food isn&#39;t bad, either. For a burgers and fries kind of place, they have pretty good selection and a fair number of healthier offerings. I love that I can opt to &#34;build a burger&#34; and get a boca vegan patty or gardenburger vegetarian patty and my choice of toppings and bun. Or, diners can opt to omit the bun and enjoy their burger &#34;protein style,&#34; wrapped in lettuce. For a small price increase, you can also get sweet potato fries here instead of regular french fries. I am always surprised by how good the sweet potato fries are here since so many places seem to screw them up somehow, usually either by not salting them at all or drowning them in brown sugar. They also offer more beer, shakes, and other beverages than you&#39;d expect.

One down side is that the service is pretty hit or miss. On some visits, I leave totally satisfied with the job our server did. Other times, we aren&#39;t offered a refill or more &#34;bottomless&#34; fries until we&#39;ve finished eating and have been sitting there for a while--in other words, until it&#39;s too late. Sometimes things run smoothly, and we&#39;re in an out pretty fast, while other times we sit and wait for the check so long that we end up running late. Usually the servers are at least friendly and nice, but recently we had one who noticed my Cubs shirt and decided to rant at me about how much better the White Sox are while he had me captive. In addition to being rude and inappropriate, I was pregnant at the time and VERY HUNGRY. This guy was playing with fire--getting between a pregnant lady and her food is a dangerous game. He&#39;s lucky he didn&#39;t lose a hand. My husband was really annoyed that we had to wait for this guy to close his cakehole and give us our food, so he spoke with a manager about it, though we never heard back from the manager about whether he told the server to chill the hell out with that stuff.

(Note to the server in question if you happen to read this--you might want to check out this video:

http://FunnyOrDie.com/m/6q01

And for the record, Zambrano had a no-hitter two seasons ago.)

In short, sometimes we have a four or even five star experience here, but other times, Red Robin falls far short. This is a great place to go if you are looking for a burger joint that can feed a carnivore, a vegetarian, and a vegan or a group of children of various ages. For date night, go elsewhere, unless you think having to tell off a server is romantic."

Drinks $3.50+ They&#39;ve got over 12 varieties of hamburger, a few of salmon, fish and chicken.   Salads, fajitas and other junk.

The people that works here are literally dumb and stupid. Especially,  the managers. So, my wife and I and my new born decided to go out and try out this joint. Right when we got to the door. There was a crowd of people lined up, already. It was 2 lines. No sign what so whoever that says line up to the left to get sitted and line up to the right to be sitted. No structure what so ever. So we waited about 30mins just to get at the door. And the female at the door said to me, you have to line up to the left so you get sitted. I&#39;m like huh? I didn&#39;t wna argue with the host. so we went ahead and line up to the left. We waited another 20 mins just for them to take my phone number down. to get a text on my phone to be sitted. We line up to the right of the door. At this point , I&#39;m already frustrated. So, after another 15mins of waiting. We finally got a text. Saying our table is ready. When we got the door to finally get sitted. The same exact person that took down my phone number. Told me I can&#39;t take my stroller inside. This idiot couldve just told me that when I was waiting in line for 45 mins. And cudve went some where else. I ask politely if I could talk to the manager. Manager comes out all flustered. So, after telling the manager my whole dilemma. This freaking idiot tells me   &#34;you, do know this is our busiest time of the year &#34; . I told him, I don&#39;t give a rats asss. Holiday or not. You guys got to have some sort of a structure or signs that says line up to the left to be sitted and line up to the right to get sitted. Or a sign the indicates that you can&#39;t have strollers. The manager didn&#39;t NOT even apologize to my family. He just hurried back in the restaurant. What a complete waste of time."

The Royal Red Robin Burger is the epitome of burger excess.  This is one of my absolute favorite burgers on the planet.  The perfect combination of juicy ground beef, hickory smoked bacon, American cheese, and a fried egg, makes me tremble with joy.  This is the only burger I&#39;ve ever tried at Red Robin, and that&#39;s because it&#39;s the only one I ever want to eat.  

The meal wouldn&#39;t be complete without the bottomless steak fries.  I order mine with parmesan cheese drizzled on top.  I have also tried the chocolate milk shakes, and hot fudge sundaes on several occasions, and its always thick and creamy.  The menu is quite extensive, with everything from appetizers, regular burgers, to chicken, fish, turkey, and garden burgers, desserts, and even a kids menu.  

I believe there are 13 gourmet burgers on the menu, and I&#39;m sure all of them are good in their own right.  The only burger for me is the Royal Red Robin.  Maybe one day I will be bold enough to try another burger on the menu, but why mess with a good thing???"

Great value on the kids meals, entree, side and drink and a good variety in menu choices. I like the healthy options for the sides.  My kids love veggies so the carrots (choice of raw or steamed) and the broccoli are a hit with them.

For the adults - the variety in the burgers is fantastic.  Our faves are the Royal Red Robin (egg on a burger is ingenious!), Mushroom, and Banzai Burger.  Never had a burger that wasn&#39;t cooked perfectly.  I get mine medium and it always has the perfect amount of pink.  The onion rings are awesome it&#39;s a regular appetizer for us. And who doesn&#39;t love endless steak fries?  We usually put a generous helping of the Red Robin seasoning on them, but they&#39;re good plain as well.  We&#39;ve  been here often enough that I tell myself I have to try the other things on the menu (fish and chips, pastas, salads), but the burgers are so good that I have to stick with them...but one of these days I&#39;ll be able to write an update review on their other entrees!

Definitely have to agree with the rave reviews on customer service at the Woodfield location.  Each and every time we&#39;ve been here, the service has been outstanding no matter what time it is, busy or not.  Quick, friendly, and efficient service.  The manager also almost always does rounds at each table to ensure that things are running smoothly.  Food is served quickly and they really move tables without making you feel rushed.  About half the time we&#39;ve been here, there&#39;s been a line (crowds being in Woodfield), but they always give you an accurate sense of wait time...and get you in when they say they will.

Easy to see why it&#39;s one of our favorite places.   Red Robin...Yummmm : )"

Your boyfriend is hungover. You&#39;re estranged daughter just finished serving a 5-year stint at the local county cell. 
Where you gonna go?

You&#39;re going to go to Red Robin. Let me tell you why.

Their fries are endless. Trust me, they will keep bringing fries out to you. They&#39;re tasty too. Now, you&#39;re going to pay extra for cheese sauce or jalapenos, but let me tell you, these fries don&#39;t need no dressing up. Sprinkle some of that Red Robin special blend. I tell ya, those were the spices Columbus came to this great nation for.

Now i&#39;ve had some burgers in my time, but nothing beats the burgers at Red Robin. These are big, tender, juicy find pieces of freshly pattied meat. They&#39;ve even got some salads, that will fill you&#39;re tender heart with holiday spirit. 

And let me tell ya. The service is top-rate. Good old boy, Chris, you&#39;ll see him chatting it up and delivering burgers, you might be moved to tip a little extra. Ya should.

Go there now. What you waiting for."

I ordered the Two Taco Combo. If I recall correctly - one taco is $4. The Combo includes two tacos (mix and match), a side, and a drink. Now, I don&#39;t claim to be good at math but I say the Combo is a better deal. :)

You have your choice of a more mild, sweet salsa and a hot salsa. Nothing in between. Wish there was for someone like me... I know everyone&#39;s interpretation of &#34;hot&#34; is different so the hot salsa that I choose could very well have been mild in someone else&#39;s eyes.

My side of choice was the cilantro lime rice. It was good - although there were bigger pieces of cilantro in there (dime size) that isn&#39;t too appetizing-looking when it is all wilted buried in some rice...

Portion size was decent. Left nice and satisfied. I would definitely seek this food truck out again."

My husband and I were incredibly hungry and decided to get lunch from this truck because it had options (meat and veggies) for both of us and didn&#39;t have a ridiculously long line. 

We waited thirty minutes on a cold, windy day from the time we stepped in line to when we got our food. We also had to wait a bit longer because the wind kept blowing out the pilot light in the truck, which is essential for cooking. The Calle Wagon people were super nice about it, though. We didn&#39;t want to stay any longer so we got our food to go and were home in less than ten minutes.

My husband ordered a beef burrito and I had the Mediterranean quesadilla. According to my husband, the burrito was hot and good, but disappointedly small. My [surprisingly huge!!] quesadilla seemed more like a pita sandwich than a quesadilla to me. And it wasn&#39;t warm at all. It tasted ok. My appetite wasn&#39;t quenched. I was completely bummed.

Calle Wagon didn&#39;t satisfy (especially after a long wait and a $15 bill). I wavered between giving them two or three stars for my disappointing meal. I really hate giving a food truck with good service such a low rating, but we were pretty unhappy with our meals. Sorry, Calle Wagon."

Now to the food. The Rangoons were great. They actually tasted like crab not some random soy food. There were not burnt or overcooked and had a nice amount of stuffing. The TSO Chicken was great too. It was a lot in that white container. They stuffed it to the max which left me enough for TWO DAYS. I love the option for vegetable brown rice as most places just give you white. The chicken itself was well seasoned and had a lot of sauce. It wasn&#39;t dry or lacking on sauce.

The place is clean enough to sit and have a quick meal and could probably handle a few customers dining-in at a time.  The Crab Rangoon was bland and if ordered, you&#39;ll need a lot of sauce to enjoy. Their egg roll was better than decent.  Fresh, though not oily or soggy.  
I stopped in on a weekday to try a lunch special and found the food to be...average.  They offered a good portion and the taste was alright, for the price.  If you&#39;ve read other reviews, you&#39;ll notice that some of the ladies mention a large portion or &#34;foods piled high.&#34;  Not the case for my Dad and I.  But when the next customers entered I noticed something a little fishy.  All customers get a sizable portion with the lunch special, right.  But, if there&#39;s a dude at the counter when an attractive lady enters, well, she&#39;s in for a surprise = food, piled, high.  Not to get anyone&#39;s hopes up or to cause a stir, it really depends on the likes of the counter guy.  That day, he clearly had a thing for &#34;Gilfs.&#34;.  

Food / cost ratio is alright but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d repeat.  Even though we spent close to twenty dollars on food, they asked for $.30 cents for hot sauce, stating the charge has something to do with rising food costs. (My ass, seriously.

Entrees were pepper steak, Mongolian beef and orange chicken. All just ok.

Prices were cheaper, portions large, staff ok. But not worth the money no one wants the leftovers. Plus, to add insult to injury, the 4  FREE crab rangoon for spending over $16 (my order was actually right at 60 bucks) were missing.

But the pork in the pork chop suey was about as tenderized as any pork I&#39;ve ever eaten, tenderized to the point where I wonder if it is pork (could be anything really). The vegetables were very fresh and crispy. Egg rolls were very good, better with the mustard and sweet &amp; sour packets poured on."

I&#39;ve seen it a million times but didn&#39;t think much of it because it looked a bit shabby and was in a strip mall. However the prices are amazing and the food is even better! Shocked.

The lady working was friendly, nice &amp; quick in taking my order. For two lunch specials piled HIGH with food it was only $9.75. It really is a ton of food. I got one to have for lunch and one to have for dinner but it was way too big to eat it all in one sitting for lunch. 

For lunch I tried the eggroll and sesame chicken. I&#39;m very picky with my eggrolls and they have VERY good eggrolls. Big, crispy, filled with an extremely tasty combination of ingredients inside. I loved it! The sesame chicken was better then I&#39;ve had anywhere in a long time. The flavor was amazing, just spot on. The chicken pieces were the perfect size and perfect crispness.

For dinner, I had the sweet &amp; sour pork. Again very tasty, way above average, huge portion, better then usual pork.

I will absolutely be back to China Wok II!"

I wasn&#39;t impressed by this place. The crab rangoon was skimpy with the filling-- mainly onions. The garlic chicken was breaded which I was not expecting. All I ever order at Chinese restaurants is garlic chicken and never once has it been breaded. I asked for a side or garlic chili sauce with my order and it was not included. The food wasn&#39;t terrible but I definitely will not be ordering from here again.

I have been wanting to try this place because they have fish on their menu (and most suburban Chinese restaurants don&#39;t).  I got the Hunan Style Fish Fillet, and it was very tasty!  I&#39;m not a fan of the water chestnuts and baby corn that seam to come in all suburban Chinese food dishes that contain vegetables, so next time I will ask to have those excluded.My husband got the General Tso&#39;s Chicken Combination plate.  He also enjoyed his food.  The portions are very large so you will always have leftovers. (I love leftovers!)

The only reason I didn&#39;t give 5 stars is because you can find much better Chinese food in the city, which is no surprise.  But for a quick fix without traveling, this place is great!  I will be back!"

I ordered the beef chow mein Cantonese style (pan fried noodles). 
It was very good - nice portion and there was a really nice variety of vegetables with the beef (carrot, zucchini, broccoli, onion, bamboo shoot, water chestnut). I thought this really contributed to the flavor - and it&#39;s great to get your vegetables when you are eating some deliciously heavy beef chow mein :)

Lived in DP for 4 yrs and regret that I am just now trying this place, which has as of now replaced my go-to expensive, thus not-ordered-very often Szechwan. (Yes, I realize Szechwan is a SIT DOWN restaurant, but I alway took out)

The portions are large. Two entree and two sides garned two meals for two people.  Breaking down the check into 4 meals, that is $6 meal. Enough with with numbers and onto the food

Please don&#39;t judge the place on the strip mall location or that it is small (two tables and a counter w/ stools).

We ordered:

order egg rolls
order potstickers
orange beef
mongolian beef (combo that comes w rice n eggroll)

Both of us ordered our entree &#34;mild&#34; and they actually were MILD yet not bland (order orange beef or chicken mild at Szechwan and you will find those red peppers in your meal regardless).

Typical in that young family members were happily occupied at one of the tables.  Chef actually gave us the bag and confirmed that he had done the order right (!!). The friendly owner was happy to tell us they deliver as far as 5 mi. (YEA for me!)

Pot stickers awesome - why is it some restaurants dont serve w the typical dark sweeter soy w ginger? - I am glad this one does!

The fried rice that accompanies the combos is chicken fried rice.  Good flavor, not greasy and you can actually SEE the carrots and chicken in it, not slivers but actual chunks.

I can&#39;t wait to try more of their menu. Honestly, I&#39;ve been getting such attitude at Szechwan, albeit on the phone, I am happy to take my business elsewhere."

My garlic chicken entree was good and the large portion is BIG.  On the downside, the &#34;medium spicy&#34; was not, in fact, very spicy at all.  There was also the usual pitfall of downmarket Chinese dishes: heavy on the  zucchini, light on more flavorful veggies. 

I got the steamed pot stickers as well.  They were thick and doughy, which is pretty much what I was going for.  

Overall, considering the good service and the value (especially considering the portion size), I will be ordering again."

sesame chicken had a lack-luster red color, it was drenched in sauce, and it tasted more like a desert- holy moly it was sooo cloying.  

Orange chicken: Tasted exactly like the sesame chicken except it was a little spicy. The only way my boyfriend and I were able to distinguish the both of them was that the sesame chicken dish came with sesame seeds lol. 

The crab rangoons stole the show, but hey, there wasn&#39;t much to compete against. I though they were scrumptious, airy, and oh so tasty i just kept taking bite after bite..

Let me preface that I love Chinese food, or at least what passes for it here in the States, but frequently I get indigestion afterwards. Not sure why exactly, but it seems to be a common issue for me regardless of the cook/restaurant. However, that is no longer the case.

After my first visit &amp; order was nothing short of spectacular, I&#39;ve ordered from them about a dozen times now: lunch specials, full entrees, you name it.

Another nice thing is that they&#39;re very friendly here, it&#39;s not just about being a business.  The second time I came in I was recognized and didn&#39;t even have to say what my pickup order was.

The best thing about this place is the customer service.  The owner is the nicest guy you will meet.  He is sweet to my kids and always gives us something on the house- bread or soda.  He always treats us like preferred customers.  Also, the workers always offer to carry my food out to my car for me."

I only give it 2 stars because the customer service is terrible and we will never patronize this business again.  Unfortunately after reading other reviews our experience is not the only time this has happened.  We&#39;ve ordered from here 2-3 in the past few months, the food was great and when we arrived to pick it up the people were overly nice.  Then one day a few weeks back my wife went to order and things went sour fast.  We tried to order for an hour later and he said it&#39;s best to call about 20 minutes before, so she did but they got busy in the meantime and the pickup time changed.  That&#39;s completely understandable, but my wife nicely questioned it because he advised to call back.  During her normal conversation the guy turned into an asshole and was yelling at my wife.  Really?  That&#39;s how you want to treat a customer??  Do you really think we want you to make food I&#39;m going to eat after you get pissed about a small question?  He made my wife cry because of how he treated her.  I own a small business myself and this would never happen.  Customer service is 100% of the reason why businesses stay successful.  Even when the customer is wrong you try to make it right or work with the customer to come to a resolution.  My wife was not unrealistic, all she did was ask why and for some reason he snapped.  So your food may be great, but your attitude lost a customer who hoped they had finally found their weekly pizza supplier."

I ordered my food at 5 pm on a Friday.  The man on the phone was super helpful and nice, and there was some confusion about one of the dishes I ordered--Alfredo Parmigania.  We tried to clear it up, and since I was paying with cash, I asked my total (so I could have everything ready for the delivery driver).  He said he would add it up and call me back.  He never did :(  I called him back and found out the total, but I was hoping not to have to do that.

The Great:
**The chicken wings--FREE w/ the coupon of $25+ order.  Not the &#34;triditional&#34; wings.  They were crispy like fried chicken and had BBQ sauce almost drizzed over them.  Sounds strange, but they were really good!!
**The X-tra thin crust pizza.  Really good sauce, great cheese, not too greasy, and it was pretty big for a &#34;small&#34;.  I really enjoyed this, and I am usually not a thin-crust kind of a gal!
**Friendly Service
**Prices aren&#39;t too bad at all!

The Not-So-Great:
**The cinnamon sugar bites--Good in theory, and the ones that were actually covered in the cinnamon sugar were good, but 80% of them were completely naked, and therefore didn&#39;t taste like anything
**The pan pizza was just meh.  It had grease sogging through the bottom of the box when I received it.  WAY too greasy for me.
**The Alfredo Parmigania (which we had confusion about while I was ordering it) was described as: &#34;A creamy spin on the much-loved classic.our Chicken Alfredo Parmigania combines the best of both worlds&#34;.  So I don&#39;t know if they just got it wrong, but I received grilled chicken on a bed of alfredo sauce over fettucini.  I guess I was expecting something different.  Maybe that was my bad??  But in any case, I didn&#39;t really care for the alfredo sauce at all.  It was really bland.

Something I did appreciate was that they called me after the delivery time was over an hour and explained that they were slammed and on their way.  It was nice that they did that because I was wondering where in the world my food was!

I would definitely recommend and order from them again!  I can&#39;t wait to try some different items--their menu is really vast!"

You can tell the obvious quality in ingredients that he uses...the cheese is great and I wish I could swim in a bathtub of the pizza sauce.  Terrific crust too.  We served this as a LEFTOVER to a family member who is a major food snob and he thought we had made this ourselves!  (I do make a pretty rockin homemade pizza).  It&#39;s just that good.

We waited for 15 minutes past our promised time. To make up for it, they gave us a bottle of water; the only highlight. We got home, the pizza was crazy burnt and the vegetables tasted like they had been cooked in dirty oil.

Ordering was ok. It was a little confusing though. Sometimes the guy would repeat what I said (what I ordered, my name, etc.) so that I knew he had it correct, and sometimes he wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure if that was a bad phone connection or what. But, before letting him go, I just confirmed that the order was right and he did get it right.

Delivery was fast. It took around 20-25 minutes. I don&#39;t live far away. But, i&#39;ve had some other local places take over an hour. So, 20-25 minutes is excellent to me.

The pizza itself was just ok. I tried the extra thin crust because i&#39;m used to the south side Chicago pizza (thin, crispy crust). This crust was quite soft. We were able to kind of roll the pizza slices to break them apart as we took them out of the box. The flavor was ok. I&#39;d have liked more crispy crust and to have the cheese cooked a bit more (it was quite white) personally.

I&#39;d give this place a 2.5 overall. But, since I have to choose between 2 or 3 stars, i&#39;m going with 3 just because nothing was very bad, it just wasn&#39;t good to me."

Normally it&#39;s ok - fairly average fayre for an in-office deli. But last week, I ate a chicken quesadilla there. It was the only thing I ate all day, so seemed pretty clear that this was likely the cause of my very severe food poisoning that onset later that day. I believe the chicken must have been contaminated somehow (left out in the heat too long?) but either way, it made me very very ill. It was definitely food poisoning and not a stomach bug, and as this was the only place I ate that day, this is my pretty strong conclusion. I also thought at the time, the chicken was not the best quality. So I guess I shouldn&#39;t have eaten it if I had had doubts. Anyhow, my advice is, by all means eat here, but perhaps choose things that don&#39;t matter if they have stood out all day. :-("

My only gripes are with the inconsistency of service, the cleanliness and frozen french fries.  I realize much of their staff are high school and early college aged kids but with relating with customers, I think some of them could hold back with their sarcastic expressions and exclamations.  I&#39;ve never had to deal with it, but I&#39;ve seen other customers get a full eye&#39;s worth and heard some of the stuff mentioned in reviews.  Whenever I hear a kid with a part-time job say &#34;oh my gosh&#34; I giggle a little inside.  Seriously, it&#39;s a fast food job, you&#39;re here to serve this customer a sundae with heath candy, just do it already.  To hit the other end of the CS spectrum I&#39;ll share a short story of this cashier&#39;s excellent customer service from the other night.  It was near closing time and an older lady had entered.  She was quite indecisive on what she wanted to eat.  She seemed to be a return customer (she knew the menu) but for whatever reason engaged kid into a lengthy ordering process explaining toppings on sandwiches and the spice level of a spicy entree.  I took the discussion as, she was really looking forward to engaging &#34;someone&#34; and he happened to fill that role. He entertained her needs and explained everything down to how spicy he thought the entree could be. (entree = buffalo chicken fingers or sandwich, I can&#39;t remember which) I could tell she was happy that he entertained her needs.  I don&#39;t know if this kid knew what he did for her.  But I&#39;m glad he did it without the sarcastic undertones that some can engage in.

Moving on; the cleanliness.  There are surfaces that feel sticky and dirty to the touch.  When a business opts to using less cleaning product when wiping a surface or substituting vinegar in a solution bottle without cleaning out the bottle first, sprayed areas can have a residue and feel sticky.  And since we&#39;re talking about sticky have you seen the floors in here? The tiles have ridges on them which have an appearance like it was formed by crashing waves.  The dirt from shoes has collected within the ridges and grime can be seen across the tiled areas of the restaurant.  Businesses never think about the grime that hides in plain sight on tiled floors.  And my last gripe, frozen french fries.  Haven&#39;t we come far enough in time to realize that fresh cut is the way to go?  Maybe one of these days..."

They told me that if I order the combination chicken dinner it was already cooked and waiting but if I ordered all white that it would take another 20 minutes. I ordered the combo pieces. When my fried chicken dinner finally came 25 min. later, it was very disappointing. The half chicken had two white pieces and two dark which I expected but even the dark meat pieces were dry inside. All four pieces were very &#34;hard&#34; and overcooked. This meant no flavor whatsoever. The creamy style cole slaw was very tasty but only go to enjoy 4 tablespoons of it. Why skimp customers on the cole slaw? The potatoes were &#34;ok&#34; but the gravy was off. And even the diet Pepsi was flat! But a server walked through the restaurant, noticed me sitting alone and gave me a complimentary custard. I thought that was very nice even though someone probably got an order wrong.

You can eat pretty good fast food on the fly and not over spend. I would rather get quality than quantity any day of the week. 

There are few tips I have to share:
1.) when driving thru, and if you want ketchup, ask for it at the window. Kinda silly that they don&#39;t at least put on pack in the bag if you ordered fries, but they do not. Remember to ask. I get mad every time I&#39;m back at the office and without ketchup.
2.) they do not use a lot of salt on the fries either, (not complaining here!) be sure to ask for some salt if you like your fries a little salty.
3.) if you are in a hurry, you can call in your order and pick up at the drive thru.
4.)their fried chicken is some of the best fast food fried chicken.
5.) they have caffeine free diet Pepsi.

My favorite things:
Obviously, their fried chicken. You can order white meat only without an up-charge. 
Their pork tenderloin sandwich. I order it with pickles and mustard only. It&#39;s awesome!
Their pot roast dinner with green beans and mashed potatoes. Order the potatoes with the beef gravy in stead of the chicken gravy. You&#39;ll be glad you did.
Single Culver&#39;s Deluxe Burger without onion. Always a winner!

Enjoy!"

- never order pizza from a gyros place
- never get fries from a chinese buffet
get the point? 

So anyways.  The sign says Culver&#39;s: Frozen custard and butter burgers. Therefore, you wont&#39; fail if you come here for a burger and dessert.  Everything else is at your own risk.

I love mushrooms. The mush-swiss is great for me. But FYI: most burgers won&#39;t come with lettuce and tomato, onion, pickle, etc.  unless specified on the menu. Still, I&#39;ve never had a problem asking for a couple of sides without extra charge.  Their fries are crinkle cut; of these, I&#39;m a fan.  Burger wise, it tastes like a burger. Thank God, right?!! But really. It&#39;s pretty juicy and has flavor. Doesn&#39;t taste like indescribable meaty grit that came out of a freezer.

I&#39;ve had their concrete mixers... and i think these, while never tasting bad, don&#39;t necessarily taste great. My bf says they taste like concrete. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re horrible.  

But if you wanna go right, do a sundae.  We did traditional (cuz why mess with a good thing?).  A sundae with hot fudge, banana, and almonds. Perfect combo. Peanuts aren&#39;t too exciting for me, so the almonds were nice and thinly sliced in good proportions. 

We gobbled it all up. 

I so recommend this if you&#39;re looking for cheap eats and you&#39;re in the area. The custard is super rich, so make sure you&#39;ve got access to a nearby bathroom afterwards if you&#39;re lactose intolerant. But man, is it worth it!! It&#39;s got great flavor and creaminess. The custard seems to hold up well better than ice cream and doesn&#39;t turn into soup on you either.

It&#39;s cheap. It&#39;s fast food well cooked with good flavor.  But remember. It&#39;s still fast food. I got a hair in a concrete mixer once. ewww.  But they exchanged it right on spot. P.S. Don&#39;t expect awesome service. I mean. Again. Still fast food."

This sandwich is FREAKIN&#39; AWESOME!!!  I&#39;ve never had a fish sandwich this good!!!  I swear this was the best fish sandwich I&#39;ve ever had!!!  The walleye is not processed at all. If it is, it is the best disguise I&#39;ve ever seen. The piece of fish reminded me of the fish I had at a place in NYC called Assault &amp; Battery. Bobby Flay lost on his show Throwdown back in 2007.

The walleye is lightly battered and deep fried. The sandwich comes on a very tasty bun with a light amount of tartar sauce, shredded lettuce, and shredded cheddar cheese. 

If you like fish, you&#39;ve got to try this fish sandwich!!! It is definitely worth the price!!!"

I had no idea that they have custard!! I&#39;m from Georgia. I didn&#39;t know that custard could be a good thing. Where have I been?

Per Wikipedia, &#34;Frozen custard is a cold dessert similar to ice cream, made with eggs in addition to cream and sugar.&#34;


I ended up getting one scoop of vanilla with heath bar and Andes Mint. It was nice... this was a whole bunch of goodness. I had just finished dinner, so I couldn&#39;t believe I had room in this. I was actually full, but ... I couldn&#39;t stop eating ths custard. I mean, it&#39;s got eggs, right? So ... eggs are good for you? .... (keep repeating that to yourself!) 

*****
The custards are pretty reasonably priced. If you&#39;re female, get one scoop! not two scoops! Even if you&#39;re male! It can be pretty rich, so go for one scoop at a time. ;-) 

They have tons of toppings that you can choose from. 
Heath bar, kit kat, Andes, Nuts, and the list goes on and on and on.... 


Give it a shot. 

BTW, the people working the night we visited (Monday) were friendly. So, good job, Culver&#39;s with customer service that night."

A friend and I were having a little girl&#39;s night out, and we ended up coming to this bar after some food and drinks for another round. She ordered a glass of cab and I ordered a sangria with veggie platter. Not much, right???

Wrong!  The sangria was oh so yummy, and the veggie platter was HUGE and very well assorted &amp; fresh. The bartender was super super nice, and refilled on our water constantly, asking if we needed anything often enough to feel welcomed :). 

We are going back for some grub next time. Hope we get same level of service, because it was so great!!!!"

The servers try but they often aren&#39;t too customer focused and it seems like they&#39;re just going through the motions until their shift ends.

Here&#39;s my problem with Gatsby&#39;s and why I give them 2 stars: their policy on soft drinks. At Gatsby&#39;s, if you order a soda and it&#39;s $2.50 or whatever they charge, if you want a refill you have to pay $1.00 for each additional refill. I don&#39;t know any place that does this. Soft drinks are SO cheap and free refills are pretty standard at any restaurant.

I came in with a group of friends recently and 2 of us ordered soda. I asked if they still charge for refills and she said yes, but since we were there for trivia, she wouldn&#39;t charge us. OK cool! She offered to bring us a pitcher of Diet Coke and we figured this was so she didn&#39;t have to make frequent trips to refill our glasses. When we all received the checks, one of the people in our party had a charge on their bill for a $6.00 pitcher of soda!! Way to pad the bill, Gatsby&#39;s! That&#39;s just not cool.

Will I return? Probably since they have fun karaoke nights and themed trivia from time to time. Next time I&#39;ll be drinking water. ;)"

Drinks : the drinks here are awesome! The bartenders are great and make the drinks pretty strong, so I feel like we get what we pay for! I especially like their Bloody Mary. 

Food: the food is alright; some of the dishes could definitely be improved. I am a fan of the chicken avocado melt, and we always get the loaded cheese fries which are a family favorite.

We ended up just sitting at the bar talking the entire night (oops). The atmosphere is not my favorite - a little dark and almost divy. There was a group of very intoxicated people that were pretty obnoxious (apparently they were like that when they got there, and eventually they left).

We sat at the bar. At first the bartender was not very friendly. We ordered a few beers, and then I ordered the chicken tenders. One of the tenders was not cooked all the way through. I nicely let the bartender know. At first she didn&#39;t say anything, but later apologized and gave us a free drink for being nice about the situation. I did not have to pay for them either. She said that usually the chicken tenders are cooked through, but these happened to be bigger than usual. I got the nachos instead, and those were good (and big, I couldn&#39;t finish them all). It is your typical bar food at a cheap price. They also have good drink specials, and a decent amount of beers on tap.

They had trivia going on, but I&#39;m not sure how many people were actually playing. They have TVs everywhere so you can watch a game or something else. Overall it is alright, but it wouldn&#39;t be my first pick for a handout or dinner."

We had a group of only 6 and the server didn&#39;t like that we asked for separate tickets it and gave us attitude.  Is that too much to ask? Is it that difficult?  We also received our food at different times, like one person was almost finished eating by the time someone else got their meal.  I find that odd. 

I have ate here multiple times and this has been consistent behavior.  Another weird thing is I have ordered deep dish pizza here twice.  One time it was just a little thicker thin crust, not your traditional Chicago deep dish.  The next time, still not Chicago deep deep but significantly thicker, maybe double the size.  There is an inconsistency of food.

Overall go there to drink and watch a game but don&#39;t expect a great experience with service if you order food or have a group."

I had been here before (purely to drink) so I knew what to expect on that front, but I was curious about what they had to offer food-wise. 

We noticed they had festive drink specials so before we looked at any menu items we ordered two Cat&#39;s Pajamas shots; I can&#39;t say that I often kick off a meal with a shot, but as they say: when in Rome, drink like it&#39;s the 20&#39;s. 

We grabbed two, very tall, light beers also on special (very cheap) and browsed the menu. I didn&#39;t have to look much further than the specials page, because it was Friday and everything I was looking for was right there, so sure enough ordered the burger and fries meal/combo/deal. When the food came I was pleasantly surprised because it reminded me of my college days: walking to the bar down the street, ordering a burger basket and a beer and playing darts and jukebox tunes into the night. 
The burger was very good, the fries were good, the beer was cold. Perfect.

Without criticism there can be no improvement, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here.
We weren&#39;t sure what we were doing when we walked in so we found a table near the bar. We were greeted by a server who took the order for our festive shots and she came back to serve the drinks but seemed to disappear into the crowd. Then a gentleman from behind the bar area took our orders for the aforementioned beers, and eventually the food. After we ate, he cleared our table, and later, the original server came back to ask if we needed anything (just the check at this point). 
This wasn&#39;t a particularly negative thing; just confusing when it came to tipping. 
I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s standard practice at Gatsby&#39;s; we just felt it was a little odd. I should mention that both servers were very friendly and enthusiastic. 

I have seen the reviews on Yelp for Gatsby&#39;s and they can be a little misleading. I think people expect to come into the bar and want a fine-dining experience. Go somewhere else for that. Gatsby&#39;s is a bar that serves bar food; satisfying and tasty bar food. I guess I also noticed negativity about the service in the past, so perhaps our multi-server experience was their effort to correct that. I plan to be back on a Friday to sure enough, eat a burger, drink a beer, play darts, and probably watch a number of games on a few of their many televisions. I can&#39;t give half stars, so three is the magic number here, old sport.

Cheers,"

It was fun! The red siren lights were my favorite. It kind of had a townie bar feel. The service was decent. I believe the server was trying her best, but she kept forgetting to bring out our drinks. The Green Line beer I ordered tasted like crap. I sent it back saying it was old and they came back and confirmed it was the last glass and they were changing out the keg. Maybe it is a less popular drink here, but I couldn&#39;t believe they actually served it to me. There are no vegan items on the menu, which really didn&#39;t surprise me, but that would be a great move on their part. I ended up getting a veg pizza and just held the cheese (I love cheese, but have an intolerance). Even getting Daiya or another cheese alternative would be fantastic. They also raffled off hockey jerseys, which my cousin&#39;s husband actually won. The uncomfortable part about that is that we are pretty sure it was a knock off because we saw a price tag with 10 yen (the Japanese dollar) on it. Woof."

1st time: Male server very inattentive &amp; rude, music was incredibly loud, food service slow and food was only ok.  But we thought, it&#39;s a Saturday and maybe they were busy so we&#39;ll give them another try.

2nd try: A few months later we went in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  We noticed a 3&#39; sign outside the door that had a special on Coors Light so we thought - ok we&#39;re having that for sure!  Had a lovely server greet us and we asked for the Coors Light special.  She went away to the bar to fill our order and have some words with the bartender and came back empty handed telling us that the bartender (same guy we had as our server the first time we were here) REFUSED to sell us the Coors Light at that price because there was NO special.  I informed her to walk outside the door to verify the 3 FOOT SIGN with the special on it.  She did and informed the bartender about the special price, he then yelled at her and told her that he&#39;s not honoring that price and would give us Miller Lite instead.  She came back and said to us &#39;I&#39;m sorry - he&#39;s refusing to give you this price and will only honor it with Miller Lite because he doesn&#39;t think SUNDAY is part of the weekend specials.&#34;.  HUH?  Sunday is not part of the weekend - OK.  We then informed her that this was the SECOND bad experience at this place and the only way we can counteract bad service is to talk with our money.  We then informed her we were leaving and thanks for being so sweet but this difficult bartender/server was going to kill business at this restaurant.  It&#39;s not about the beer special or the money - it&#39;s about the point of servicing your customers.

In an area with SO many restaurant choices I refuse to patronize a restaurant that doesn&#39;t value or respect it&#39;s customers.  The only reason i rated it a 2 star instead of 1 was because our server the SECOND time was very helpful and apologetic."

Drinks were strong, service was fast and friendly.  However, tonight that all changed. 

I had went there for dinner with my mom around 6:30, and we ordered two sandwiches. 15 minutes went by, and in the past the food was out by then, that&#39;s how quick their service normally is. 20 minutes go by and we&#39;re kind of wondering alright, maybe theres something going on. 30 minutes go by and the waitress says oh it will just be two more minutes, we have a new cook sorry. Another 10 minutes go by before the manager comes over and tells us that the people before us are getting their tacos shortly, and we should be next, the owner is making our sandwiches personally. Another 20 minutes go by, no sandwiches and by this point we are starving, angry and the people behind us, who were regulars it seemed, got there food no problem yet ours was still in no mans land. We finally cancelled our order and just left with a 10 dollar gift certificate that the manger practically forced on us as a way to assure we would return at some point. 

I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll be back anytime soon. Maybe the cook was really to blame, but honestly I think it was more bad business practices. You put out orders in the way they come in, not in whatever order you want because you have regular customers that you don&#39;t want to piss off."

I have been there a few times :). The servers are great, they are courteous and always keep the tables clean of plates, drinks and make sure you are taken care of.  Yeah they bus their own tables and have to push table together to accommodate large parties but heck they do it gladly.  Not an issue for me.  It is a sports bar for goodness sake.  Too bad for the user that felt it was horrible, maybe they had an off day.   I do agree they are not flexible with free refills for pop which most places do these days or they will not deviate from their menu (no substitutes) but oh well.  For a couple of beers and some wings to watch a game it is just fine for me.  Typical bar food but they always deliver on service."

The food was tasty, with a couple of unique selections that I really appreciated for a &#34;standard&#34; sports bar.  Our server kicked ass.  He really made sure that our large group of loud guys (plus me) were taken care of all day while we were there.  The ladies room was clean and quiet compared to the bar, and our tab was about average for what you&#39;d expect to spend at a bar of similar caliber in the area.

For starters, it is absurdly loud.  When you&#39;re about to blow the speakers off the wall, that&#39;s a little much.  If I can&#39;t even talk to the person next to me in a booth because it&#39;s that loud, it&#39;s too much.  In a club I can understand but when you&#39;re primarily booths?  Nope.

The TV&#39;s can be annoying, but honestly never a problem for me.  If you&#39;re watching a big game, then it really is the place to be...if you can get in.  And like everyone else said, there&#39;s lots of them.  Again though, if it&#39;s not a big game they&#39;re showing, if the TV volume is playing, it gets really irritating.

2 out of the 4 times I&#39;ve been here, the service was crap.  I mean, constantly hunting down the server, waiting forever to get anything from her, and just basically treating us like we&#39;re not going to tip her.  I&#39;ve had better luck with the bartender and have stuck with the bar my last two visits.

The food is all right, I thought their wings were nothing special, their pizza was better than I expected.  I can&#39;t remember much else we had though being memorable.  But their food prices?  Ugh.

The consolation for me is the drinks, their prices have been pretty good.  Selection was pretty much typical of any bar.

I feel like I&#39;d enjoy this place more if I liked super loud bars or in college."

TVs are around the bar, with darts in the back area. good for family&#39;s if its early in the evening but kids shouldn&#39;t be running around there late at night.

the waitress who attended us was very sweet and friendly.. cute too. the menu was also really cheap and good . we tried their wings and the gatsby&#39;s potato skins.. both were good value for money and their taste also was good.

I mean this is great if you have the ability to move your eyes in opposite directions simultaneously while holding a conversation with whomever you came in with.  Personally if you&#39;re not a sports fanatic (which I am not), the walls of TVs do nothing more than heat the interior of the building to an uncomfortable level and produce enough flashing lights to induce epileptic seizures.  It&#39;s a gimmick I guess.  Televisions aside there is nothing else remarkable about Gatsby&#39;s.  The food is standard bar fare, nothing worth a special trip over.

The menu offers a large selection and even uses numbers to signal which dishes go best with which wine. 

Upon being seated, the waitress brings out a loaf of pretzel bread and butter. Delicious! 

We started with the &#34;Caprese Flatbread&#34; ($9) and the &#34;Burrata, Golden Beet, &amp; Arugula Flatbread&#34; ($11). Both were delicious and really great plates to share. For a main dish, I tried the &#34;Gnocchi with Butternut Squash&#34; ($16) and the Waldorf Salad ($13). The gnocci was spectacular and the salad was ok. Both entrees offered very generous portions! 

The restaurant wasn&#39;t packed and so the service was great. I feel like this is a great restaurant to come to for a glass of wine and appetizers. Almost everything on the menu is easy to share, and big enough to split. Also, lots of great options for vegetarians!"

On a Saturday night, we walked into a very busy wine tasting area (almost a little too difficult to navigate through to the hostess), checked in, and were sat immediately. I&#39;ve been to this location twice, and both times we&#39;ve sat in what appears to be a room available for private parties, tucked away in the corner - however they squash so many tables in the room that it&#39;s difficult to walk around. 

While I&#39;ve been to Cooper&#39;s Hawk more times than I can count, I apparently haven&#39;t been in a while - the menu had changed, and my favorite meal had vanished (a pasta dish with chicken). No worries - the food here is fantastic and I was confident I&#39;d find something else. However, WOW! When did the prices raise so high?! My husband&#39;s pasta dish (which I easily could have polished off with no leftovers), cost nearly $20 and it included nothing with it. To add to that, we were handed one small pretzel roll (about 5&#34; in diameter) to split between six people. I chose soup and salad, and my salad was served without shrimp. The manager came out and delivered the missing shrimp, and to my surprise, comped the meal! That made up for the cost of everyone&#39;s expensive meals!

Overall, Cooper&#39;s Hawk&#39;s all deliver great food and good service - and it&#39;s a fun place to start out wine tasting. But the increased prices are enough to drive me elsewhere."

It&#39;s basically a one stop shop for all your food and wine needs.  It&#39;s a wine lovers gift shop, a wine store, a wine tasting room, a bar and a restaurant.  Over the years I&#39;ve experienced each aspect of Cooper Hawk and have fallen more in love with this place after each visit.  You can not go wrong with a visit here.  The staff is also always amazingly customer service oriented.

A few recommendations:
Do the wine tastings.  A a wine snob, I was once very judgmental about what a winery in Illinois might possibly have that I&#39;d enjoy. Well, I bought four different bottles of wine on my last trip and frankly wish I had bought more.  Clearly they have something to offer.

At the bar or restaurant, order a bottle of wine.  They have an amazing aerating system that just makes drinking a boat load of wine even more exciting.

Try the calamari.  Calamari is calamari.  Pretty standard, right?  Nope....Coopers Hawk hits a home run here and serves the highest quality more delicious tasting calamari I&#39;ve ever had in my life!

Can&#39;t wait for my next trip to Cooper&#39;s Hawk!"

I wish the service/food quality was more consistent. Sometimes everything is SO good, and sometimes its just meh. It&#39;s generally packed on weekends so make your reservations or call if you don&#39;t see any on OpenTable. Their bar area is pretty large and first come first serve. 

The wine flights an cheese flights are always awesome. Their house wine is delicious. The sangria is a little sweet for my taste.

I used to love their buffalo chicken flatbread but they discontinued that. :( The apple brie bruschetta is soooo good. Dana&#39;s parmesan-crusted chicken and the Giardinera chicken are always a safe bet. BBQ ranch and pesto chicken salads are also yummy!

For dessert, the truffles and chocolate covered strawberries are a rip off. The Reese&#39;s ice cream cookie skillet is generally my go-to, but the last few times I&#39;ve gotten it it wasn&#39;t very warm.

OH and how could i forget the Pretzel Bread?!?!?! That is probably the main reason I go there. it is just SO damn good. I could eat an entire thing by myself EASY. Gah now i&#39;m craving some..."

The short ribs melted in my mouth and the risotto was superb! Rich in flavor and perfectly coated my palette.

My friends ordered the bisque, sirloin, coopers chicken and churasco. Had a variety of drinks and everyone was satisfied.

We decided to come here simply based on the reviews and for also their great wine selection. We were not disappointed at all!

It is very easy to locate, google map took us right to the location. The restaurant has its own private lot, so there is ample amount of parking space available. We went there around 4:00 pm during weekend and it was pretty busy. Upon entering the restaurant is their wine tasting room and then further down is their restaurant. We decided to try their wines, I was surprised that it was only 20$ for 6 tastings. That is a really good deal. The decor screams warmth and elegance. The restrooms are clean - I usually judge places based on how they take care of the restrooms.

 We decided to grab a plate of cheese and crackers and sit in the restaurant area afterwards. Our server was really nice and attentive. He bought our food right away, great presentation of the cheese on the wood board. The crackers that they gave along with it were simply amazing and the jam was delicious. We ordered a bottle of white wine as well as red wine. Red wine comes in this fancy wine dispenser. It was really impressive and we ordered other bottle of red wine just so we can have that fancy &#34;gadget&#34; on our table. I noticed few people from the other table looked at our table and asked our server about it. The prices for wine tasting and the food were reasonable. The wine was top notch and it was a fantastic experience. 

P.S. We ended up buying a bottle of Merlot."

Previous review: I was looking forward to eating here for the first time and I wanted to love this place and have it be a new favorite. Sadly, I was very disappointed. Went here with my husband for an anniversary dinner. It was a Tuesday night and we made reservations just in case. Glad we did because it was pretty busy when we got there. 

We were greeted and seated promptly, but after that things just went from mediocre to awful. I was going to order a red sangria but the server suggested the passion fruit so I went with it. Super sugary and sweet, no taste of wine or alcohol at all really. Should&#39;ve just stuck with the red. 

Ahi tuna taco app was decent. The tuna was fresh and nicely seared but I wasn&#39;t feeling the super crunchy taco shells, just a weird tasting texture mix. Still probably the best part of our meal which isn&#39;t saying much.

Then for the entree I got the trio of medallion steaks. I ordered them medium rare, but they came out 1 well, 1 med well, and 1 maybe medium. Ugh. And then the sides - the mashed potatoes totally bland, no season or flavor, and lumpy. Very disappointed because I need to have good potatoes with my steak. The &#34;sherry glazed&#34; mushrooms were literally just sautéed mushrooms in a little bowl. Not even salt or pepper. Nothing. Just bland, plain, mushrooms. Totally blah is basically all that comes to mind. My husband got the surf and turf also with the medallions. I felt bad because his steaks were even more overlooked than mine. Totally well done and borderline tough which isn&#39;t easy to do with filet. The only saving grace of was my husbands crab cake, that was pretty good. I guess. 

Unfortunately our food took so long that we didn&#39;t have time to say anything to the server (who didn&#39;t really stop by anyway) cause we had a movie to catch. But for a meal that was over $100 with tip, just really unacceptable. With all the other great reviews we were really excited to try this place, but sadly we will not be back."

The wine is all excellent and they provide ample opportunity for you to sample in order to find what you want. I&#39;d recommend buying by the bottle if for no other reason than being able to see the aerator that they use for bottles at the table.

The appetizers were each fantastic (the tostadas, though, holy cow), and it&#39;s probably impossible to go wrong with the main dishes.

Those on the other hand didn,t hold a candle to wildfire. the wine and again the service was great. The biggest issue was the water was well water and I am not a fan.

We had the meatballs, pot stickers, short rib risotto (which was very rich), and the NY strip.  Out of everything we had, surprisingly the pot stickers were my favorite!  They were on a bed of cole slaw that was so good!  The pretzel bread is also delicious.  I wish I would have remembered our servers name because he was terrific.  Definitely made my favorites list.  Can&#39;t wait to go back!  FYI this is a really great date spot and they also have complimentary valet parking."

1. The food is to die for. I have enjoyed everything on the menu. My favorite meal that doesn&#39;t make me feel completely stuffed (they serve large portions) is the steak salad. The steak is cooked perfectly.

2. The wine is delicious! In the front of the restaurant, you can enjoy wine tasting (visit the Arboretum&#39;s website for a coupon for free wine tasting) or choose to order a glass or bottle during dinner.

3. This is why I have bumped them down to three stars. I made a reservation for 12 and asked if I can adjust the number of attendees before the day of the event. They told me yes, and when I went to update the number of guests a week prior to the event, I was told I could not add any more people. That this would be considered a private party, and they do not offer them on the Friday night I had requested. They were not very accommodating at all, and I cancelled my reservation.

I love the food and wine, but was very disappointed with the reservation staff. I am very aware that they are always busy and my party is not going to make or break their night; however, I would definitely think twice before hosting a larger party at this location."

Aside from the &#34;cool&#34; decode and delicious bread, the menu options are what makes this restaurant successful.  From braised short rib, to fresh pastas, there is something for everyone on this menu.  I have been here over 20 times and it never gets old.  I consider my food palate to be pretty critical and this place is perfect. 

Give it a try!

Naturally, when he meal is over you are stuffed.  Be sure to order a few chocolate truffles to-go!"

The appetizers were okay, nothing special. I ordered the filet trip and my husband ordered the chicken giardianera. My filets were cooked well-done although I ordered them medium. My husband was not impressed with his chicken; he was unaware there would be capers in his dish. The food overall was bland, no flavor whatsoever. Our waiter came around and asked if my husband wanted another drink, everyone heard my husband say no I&#39;m good. Well guess what, our waiter came back with another cocktail for my husband although he didn&#39;t order it. Maybe it was a tactic to drive up the price of our bill but it was just weird.

It was gross and we couldn&#39;t finish it.  Plus the prices are now sky high due to its popularity, and the portions are tinier.  Too bad a good thing is now ruined.

It is crowded. Loud. The service is spotty. Food is mediocre. Wine is so-so. Why do people act like this is the best restaurant the area has to offer?

Most recently, I went here on a girl&#39;s night out. I arrived a few minutes after the party was seated, so I told the hostess I was joining a group and provided her the name. Her only response was to gesture backwards to the main room; she did not say a word. I found the party on my own (they were seated right by the opening to the dining room) with no thanks to her.

Our waitress seemed to be in a huge rush initially, and stopped by nearly every two minutes to take our order. Of course, we gals were chatting, and had not looked at the menu at all. We finally asked her to come back in five minutes - she disappeared for 30! Hungry and ready to order, we flagged another waitress down and asked her to find ours. She came back after four minutes and told us our waitress was no where to be found, but she would be happy to take our order. How on Earth does a restaurant lose a waitress?

I ordered the butternut squash gnocchi simply because it was cheap and I already knew, from past experience, that nothing at Cooper&#39;s Hawk is worth the price. Sure enough, the gnocchi were drenched in a cream sauce (very little brown butter sage, if you ask me), littered with soggy greenery. I ate half and left the rest. I did not even bother to order a glass of wine - any restaurant who cannot bother to describe their wines on the menu clearly does not have much to offer."

They also have a nice selection of chocolates to pair with your drink and a staff knowledgeable staff. After tasting we sat down to dinner. We ordered a bruschetta entrée along with crab cakes and a fish and chips platter. The service was friendly and prompt with quick refills on drink and fresh hot pretzel bread. The crab cakes were served with a spicy mayo sauce that was wonderful. Fish and chips cooked perfectly without any excess grease. One of the best dining experiences in the area! Reservations are highly recommended. We were seated at 3:50 and by 4:30 on a Sunday nearly every table was full!

Great date night spot, meet up with the girls or special occasion. Entrance has a lovely little &#39;gift&#39; shop type set up with pretty wine glasses and other gifty items. Very nice staff--this was a strong point- I realize that my girls group was quite loud with laughter but we got nothing but kindness from our server. This was my first experience and although I am not an alcohol drinker--it is a wine bar---but I was not frowned upon at all. Now the food. The Appetizers are the stars here for me---SUPER STARS. In fact I will go back and literally order all of the appetizers and that&#39;s it. Crab beignets--get them--light fluffy and delish, The porkbelly tostadas--super. The Mexican shrimp on top of guac--so good. I also ordered a virgin mojito which was really nice and refreshing. For the main dish I ordered the chicken picatta--rich and delicious--pasta perfect. We were so full that we all shared one slice of the chocolate cake that had a thick truffle like layer in between cake and ice cream. Good--not spectacular but good. Overall a nice experience for a fancy dinner--not an experience in full but relatively affordable, quick and nice service good food and night-out type of surroundings. Seriously go for the appetizers. And again, I don&#39;t drink so apologies for no wine review."

I thought they would ask first, but no big deal. 
Our waitress was busy but someone else checked on us and got water. I asked for a craft beer list and it was very short and I like craft beer so that is sad for a place like this. Once I did get my beer I was served in an obviously very dirty pint glass. 
I ordered the salmon dish which was good.  It came with an unnecessarily large helping of slaw which was wasted. My brother ordered a chicken and prosciutto dish which was drowning in a white sauce and luke warm. It also said it was served with asparagus and it can with three stalks of it. Not really much of an equal to my serving of slaw."

We used to frequent the AH location for their ample tasting room, but the drive is just too far from where we are. While the tasting room at this location leaves something to be desired (be prepared to wait if you don&#39;t get there early enough) they do offer outdoor seating and a larger bar area which AH lacks. If you&#39;re a member and have had the opportunity to visit multiple locations....or if you just have been to a few in general...you&#39;ll notice the differences of each location and note the pros and cons. 

I don&#39;t think you can go wrong walking into a CH; the wine is on point, the food is delicious, and you typically get good service. On our most recent visit we were redeeming a birthday coupon at dinner, and our server, Randall, was excellent. He remembered us from almost a year ago (excellent then too), and offered his favorite selections of wine based on what we were thinking about ordering. He was awesome (and I hope my tip reflected that!).....I always question if I tip enough, it&#39;s a phobia of mine.

Pretzel bread, seared tuna, chicken saltimboca, wine, and dessert. In my humble opinion, these make up for a top-notch dining experience, and we definitely got it. What I also like about this CH is their bar area, because we will occasionally grab a spot there, and share appetizers while drinking our wine of the month, offering a similar but different top-notch dining experience. Essentially, there is a variety of ways to enjoy this CH location, it all depends on what you are looking to get out of the experience. 
CH will take care of you, that&#39;s for sure.

Cheers."

The parking for this restaurant is like going on a safari!  Since it&#39;s in close proximity to a gym, and strip mall, parking spots are difficult to obtain.  Just save yourself the headache, and park further away from the restaurant.  The walk is good for you, and you have a slightly lower risk of door dings.

When you enter, it&#39;s a mad house... Don&#39;t even think of coming here without a previous reservation, and even then prepare to wait.  The waiting area with the wine tasting is too small for a large mass of people, and you will start to feel a little cramped.  I called ahead one night and was told there was a three hour wait! 

If you were lucky enough to survive the parking lot, and the waiting area, things start to improve.  The overall ambiance of the seating area is romantic with low lighting, and modern decor.  The wait staff seem to be all over things as well.  The food was simply okay though.  The other location off of Golf &amp; Higgins has some killer cooks that know how to perfectly cook a scallop!  My scallops at this location were rubbery.  Edible, but not as mind blowing as the last time I was able to experience them.  

I have one more try for them since I love Coopers Hawk, but I may end up driving a little more to get to the other location with ample parking, massive waiting area, short waits, killer staff, and mind blowing cuisine."

I will say, the waiters are always super nice and the managers are walking around asking if you need anything else, etc.  Plus, the wine tasting is awesome.  If you enjoy good wine, I highly recommend the 2 bottle membership.  For $35 a month you get two bottles of wine, two free tastings, and you get discounts on many things.

They called me within a couple of days with legitimate concerns that our food experience was not to our liking. They took the time to listen and ask a lot of questions. They also asked if we would return one more time with some suggestions based on what our food tastes were. I agreed because I&#39;ve never had any company care so much about how we felt about their operation. 

Two weeks later we returned and ordered different things off the menu. It&#39;s at this point, I have to say the person I talked with was dead on in her recommendation and we loved the dining experience here. So much in fact that we have been back again.  

Thank you Coopershawk. We highly recommend this restaurant. Get the steaks!!!!!"

The atmosphere is modern casual. The food is top notch American fare. Not the cheapest place to eat, but well worth the price.

I would recommend for a special occasion."

It is crazy how much this is all built up now. There are all these pretty, new strip malls and stores. Growing up in Schaumburg, this was all farmland for many, many years!

Ashley S. was our waitress and she was super sweet. The food was good and I cannot complain about anything. I think Cooper&#39;s Hawk has some solid food and service. I&#39;m not into wine, so I cannot speak to that. However, I know this is a popular place with some of my friends who really like to do wine pairings. Plus, the gift shop is really cool if you need to buy a gift for a friend who is a wine enthusiast!

Overall, a great experience. We will need to make our way out there more often!"

I have been a club member for roughly 5 years and have never been disappointed.

Not only did they make the entree to go for me for FREE, the gave me a complimentary bottle of wine to make up for it. 

I wasn&#39;t even upset about the confusion but they insisted to go above and beyond. Service like this is a dying thing today. Hats off to an excellent staff."

We chose this restaurant based on rave reviews from friends and colleagues alike- and I will definitely look forward to going back here in the future. We showed up right on time for our reservation at 7:30 on a Friday night, and the restaurant was very busy- but due to size was not overly crowded. Our server greeted us immediately and informed us about all of the beverage options. We both chose the choose your own wine flights- and all four of my wines were delightful. I&#39;m more of a white wine drinker, but I did try their reserve barrel- and it was lovely. My husband really isn&#39;t a wine drinker at all, but because of the location he opted for wine- and enjoyed all four of his flights as well.

We started with the stuffed mushrooms- which we really enjoyed- I&#39;d never had stuffed mushrooms with a Hispanic food style- and they were great. The pretzel bread to start was also phenomenal- and I was so glad our waitress included the bread that was left in our to go bag. We also each had a cup of the bisque soup- delicious with a nice kick. We each had steak based entrees- trio and risotto- neither of us could finish the meal, but definitely loved both and enjoyed the leftovers the following day.

Our waitress, whose name I did not catch, was fantastic all night. She stopped in frequently and let us know when our next course was on the way. My husband was astonished at the end of the meal when she stopped back by as we were leaving to thank us for leaving a nice tip on the meal. 

We will definitely be back- a great place for a birthday celebration!"

The service was stellar - well timed, knowledgable, polite and personable. 
The food was as good as the hip chef-driven restaurants that we frequent down in the big city.  The short ribs were tender as a mothers kiss. The scallops were prepared and seasoned wonderfully. The pretzel bread is a nice touch. 
I know they are a working winery, but honestly the wine was just ok.

The atmosphere was nice and all the the people working were so friendly! We only did a tasting and went somewhere else for dinner because they were on an hour wait. I was expecting a pretty long wait because they are a popular place, I learned that they do take reservations though so that will be a must for next time. 
We did a full tasting and had a great time. The girl helping us was named Katie and she was awesome. She explained how the tasting would work because it was my first time doing a tasting which I appreciated. Then for every wine we tasted she made sure to explain it to us. She had a great sense of humor and wasn&#39;t overly attentive while still being prompt.

I forgot that they sell all sorts of cute gifts for wine lovers - I should have come here before Christmas! Next year.

They have a nice sized wine bar that you can stand at (no seats here!) and try a variety of wines. Honestly, I liked them all except for one. We had a choice between trying 8 sweet wines, or 8 random wines featured this month. I decided random was best. You get a decent portion of each wine and crackers to munch on. I ended up buying one of the wines, and it was great! Our bartender/waitress (I don&#39;t know the proper title) was great - very knowledgeable and friendly! We even got a few other tastings while we waited for other guests to arrive.

They have a wine club that you can join for a little under $40 a month and get 2 bottles of wine a month, 2 free tastings a month, and discounts on other wine and you get points for everything you buy (eventually you get gift certificates for accumulated points - nice!).

The food here is always great. There is pretzel bread with butter while you wait, plus we enjoyed the cheese platter (you can get it with or without wine pairings). I would definitely get that again! The medallions are my favorite, but this time I ordered a salad. We even finished off dinner with some coffees (the desserts at the next table looked great too!). No complaints!"

Fried rice could use some work though.  

They serve liquor here as well so grabbed me a singapore sling which was delicious as well.

Decor is nice although you can tell they didn&#39;t spend much to impress anyone. Reminds me of the Chinese joints of the 90s.

So why the hell I ordered the broccoli and beef dinner for $7 at 4pm and expected it to be the best meal of my life is beyond me.  To be fair, I also ordered a hot and sour soup (not sour at all) and an order of their pineapple pork chop ($11).  

My meal came with 2 crab ragoons and the cream cheese in them tasted old and almost spoiled with the fried wonton itself tasting stale.  I&#39;m guessing I had leftovers from lunch.  The pork chop was okay, but just a step above any sweet and sour pork you would find at most places.  The broccoli was old too, not even green but a sad yellow excuse for a vegetable drowning in its sauce.  The beef was pretty tender I must say.  I&#39;m giving this place a 3 because I want to give this place another shot because I see potential.  Plus, there aren&#39;t a whole lot of places around this area with a Chinese menu as appealing as this place."
tasty-cuisine-chinese-restaurant-des-plaines,Jacob J.,1xJwMqmvVXPwY7yEVQIc-A,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,694,347,yVbNcadW6_qizT-yzDo5Xw,3.0,2016-01-19,"Recently I drove past Tasty C and wondered how they&#39;ve been fairing all these years.  I perused over reviews and noticed that some details had changed and became curious whether their food had taken a turn for the better.  I also noticed they finally have a website and it had decent web hosting, so maybe things were indeed different?

My first stop there on a weeknight resulted in being turned away a full 30 minutes before their closing time.  (Mind you their food hits the table very quickly) They declined offering sit-down service but said that carry-out was available. The lady at the counter was stiff faced.  No smile, no greeting nor personality.  She was as cold as the temperature outside.

My next visit was a few weeks later.  Ma and I had finished shopping in Schaumburg and she was in the mood for some Asian fusion.  Since Chef Ping&#39;s (in Rolling Meadows) didn&#39;t open till much later (for evening food service) we decided to grab something on the drive back to Chicago.  So, onto Tasty Cuisine we went. 

It was to be a late lunch, early dinner.  We arrived to the blank looks of a middle-aged man and woman lurking around a carry-out counter.  I asked for a table for two and a waiter emerged from the back dining area pointing us towards a table set for two.  The waiter gave us a decent smile which made us feel more &#34;welcome&#34;.  
The restaurant was dead for about twenty minutes then a steady stream of carry-out customers started to come and go.  The dining area is dated and I tried to recall whether it had looked the same since the last time I had dined there.  (I think it has, see my last review for more details).  It&#39;s surprising how well they&#39;ve maintained the now &#34;older looks&#34; of the place.  It looks of any 90&#39;s designed Chinese restaurant. Mostly four tops designed for seating twos or fours.  In another area closer to the restrooms they have circular tables with lazy susans.  And beyond the main dining, another cluster of tables.  A pretty big restaurant and it isn&#39;t overcrowded.

About the food.  I ordered an appetizer platter for two, chicken in garlic sauce and shrimp fried rice. I&#39;d also requested an order of their spicy beef tendons.  (If you don&#39;t know what that is or dislike the idea of eating cold tendons, I&#39;d advise against trying it. The tendons are shaved and spiced. It&#39;s got a fatty but spicy taste to them. Google it)  
I&#39;d requested that the entree and rice be prepared extra spicy, if possible.  The waiter told me this was no problem.  The appetizer platter hit the table quick!  If dining in I would suggest placing your order for soups or appetizer first and then waiting some time before ordering the rest of your meal.  These guys don&#39;t serve food in courses, they bring it all out when it is ready.  I find this practice very silly.  It&#39;s not like it was busy and they needed the space.  So while we&#39;re still on our appetizers course, our main course is on the table getting cold.

We were hungry so we didn&#39;t wait when the appetizers hit the table.  Five items are given in two servings. Crab rangoons, egg rolls, teriyaki beef skewers, BBQ ribs and battered fried shrimp.  Some of it was oily.  The egg rolls are not the best but okay.  The egg rolls are wrapped in spring roll skins, the thin, crispy kind.  But since they over fried it, it was oily. So the stuffing was oily and didn&#39;t taste very good or fresh. The ribs tasted overcooked and could have been sitting in sauce all week, I thought. The crab rangoons had been in the freezer far too long. Just don&#39;t.
The entrees were alright.  Nothing special.  It looked to be prepared fresh, so that&#39;s good.  When they served the entree and rice I saw the food ticket which had the request to make it &#34;extra spicy&#34;.  It wasn&#39;t even spicy but it had something.  

The dining room had no atmosphere.  There wasn&#39;t any music playing nor could I say I had a conversation with the owners.  Only the sounds of a restaurant were heard.  The counter people answering phone calls and talking to one another.  The sound of the filtration working on the enormous fish tank cycling water so that the tank is clean for its fish.  Sounds from the kitchen permeating the cracks along the sides of the doors and the sound of the runner working around the restaurant.

We paid our bill at the table. The waiter thanked us for coming and boxed up our leftovers.  We grabbed our stuff and started heading for the door when a woman behind the counter looked at me and quickly turned to her co-worker with a smirk and started what sounded like she was cracking a joke.  I looked up at her and the other lady, who at this time turned to look at me - was clearly a response to what she was hearing.  The jokester carried on with her joke laughing ear to ear.  Feeling the burns of my eyes upon her face the other lady didn&#39;t crack a smile, she turned and headed away from the area.  When we exited no exit greeting or thanks for the visit.  I should have crop dusted my exit and none would be the wiser."

Access from the southbound side involves an awkward U-turn against often-heavy traffic.  

Our party was introduced to the place by a local regular, who was greeted by name by the owner.  We were seated at once (the restaurant was no more  than a quarter full, on a Monday night during the Cubs playoff game).  Western silverware but no chopsticks (for which I had to ask) on the table.  Condiments limited to table salt, sea salt, and black pepper; we asked for soy sauce.  Orders were taken promptly.

We opted for the Cantonese Special Dinner for 6 at $99.95, consisting of:

- Egg drop soup
- Salt and pepper shrimp in the shell
- Dungeness crab sautéed with ginger and onion
- Green vegetables sautéed with fish fillet
- Fried chicken Chinese style.  (Duck would have been an option for this course.)
- Black mushrooms and fried tofu in oyster sauce
- Sautéed beef with broccoli

Plus, from the regular menu, excellent shrimp in lobster sauce

Everything quite satisfactory, though some of the dishes seemed a bit under-seasoned.

I&#39;m not sure about the liquor situation.  There&#39;s a service bar (no stools), apparently active, with an assortment of hard-liquor bottles on the back bar; but I didn&#39;t see it in use, and saw no drinks on any of the tables.  No drinks menu was on our table; nor did the waiter inquire about drink orders. 

Men&#39;s room clean and graffiti-free.  Decoratively a bit odd, with the slightly discordant combination of a few mildly cheesecake-y swimsuit photos and a Christian inspirational poster, that &#34;footprints&#34; thing."

I do like Chinese food so I thought we should give it a try. Well the anticipation didn&#39;t live up to reputation this place has on Yelp.
I will say they do have good customer service and provided our food promptly. We did take out and the food was warm and well packaged when we got home. The superlatives do end there, the food was less then appetizing.
We order house fried rice, egg rolls, crab Rangoon, and Mongolian Chicken. The Mongolian chicken was terrible and the rest of the items were average at best. It may have been one of those bad days for the cook but we will not be back to give the cook another try. They get 2 stars overall for service and friendliness, only one star for taste of food"

The owner is usually at the register and is so sweet and friendly, she&#39;s always so helpful how can I can I go wrong coming here.

Their rice is pretty good but many of their noodles dishes are great!  The sweet and sour is by far one of my favorites just like their egg rolls.  The egg rolls reviewed on Yelp was actually one of the main reasons I first came here. I&#39;m just a sucker for good rolls!  

The inside is very large and always nice and clean.  Their delivery coverage stretches out pretty far for the burbs so it&#39;s nice.  They have coupons on their menus but never once asked for them and actually always added it without asking which was a nice little surprise.  

You have to try out their fruit smoothies and can&#39;t go wrong with them.  I highly recommend mango or watermelon."

Moreover he was unapologetic about it. To make things worse he added a 15% gratuity to the check for just a party of 3.

Tonight, my husband and I came home and took turns hanging out in the bathroom...but for a while, our turns overlapped.

Yeah. Indigestion. Bowel explosions. Not fun. 

My toddler has had tofu many times before, but tonight I gave her a piece from my plate, and it made her throw up in her mouth. I wish I was kidding.

You might ask why we keep coming, then. Well, it&#39;s my dad&#39;s favorite place. He says they have the best shrimp fried rice outside of Chinatown. I am vegetarian; he is a rib shack kind of guy--Chinese food is one of the few kinds of restaurant on which we can agree. I keep thinking if I order something different this time, I&#39;ll have better luck, but so far I haven&#39;t hit the jackpot. Also, they have chow fun noodles, which are increasingly hard to find in Chinese restaurants in the &#39;burbs. I love chow fun. I will always give chow fun a second (or third) chance.

The sauces are also too salty, the fried foods are too greasy, the koi are in a tank that&#39;s too small for fish that size so I get depressed watching them swimming around in there, the eggrolls are a surprise (Will they have beef this time? Chicken? Shrimp? Maybe they&#39;re vegetarian today? Who knows!), the almond cookies are on the dry side...I could continue, but I will spare you the gory details. 

One thing that does stand out in a good way is the staff. They are efficient, polite, knowledgeable about the menu, clean, and just plain good at their jobs. They are always sweet to my little girl, even when she makes a mess. If my dad makes us come here again, I hope I can find something on the menu that&#39;s as good as they are!"

The cold Jelly Fish appetizer will always be one of my favorites along with any of the chow fun, steamed fish and baby bok choy dishes.  Keep in mind I have never ordered food from here because I am not FOB-u-lous enough to read the secret family style menu (which is in Chinese).

I would give this place 4.5 stars if i could!

This restaurant has steadily become the go-to for my family when we&#39;re in the mood for chinese cuisine.  Being chinese illiterate myself, i can&#39;t give recommendations on what to order (altho we always get the salt/pepper shrimp, sweet/sour pork chops), but the flavors are GOOD.  Each dish i&#39;ve had has excellent &#34;wok hay&#34;, is devoid of an onslaught of MSG, and is comfortably (but not overbearingly) oily.  The quality of their dishes hasn&#39;t changed over the past 2 years, and consistency is golden in the restaurant biz..well unless you suck originally.

What catapulted this place to #1 on my list of go-to chinese place in the chicago suburbs (even over chef ping, yu&#39;s mandarin) was the kindness of a waiter on our most previous trip.  My mom noted that our pork chops tasted old, and wanted to tell the serving staff.  She told the waiter and without argument he offered to take the dish back and give us a replacement dish of our pick (we chose another helping of the beef spareribs, which were excellent)!  Even after I ate most of the original pork chops!  Good, friendly service at these no-frills chinese restaurants is rarely found, so when you find it, you can&#39;t help but tell the world.

They even have a banquent menu, in case you have a big party to accomodate.  The tables are all spaced out nicely and it never seems too loud.  Did I mention that the prices are very reasonable as well?

Definitely a place to check out if you&#39;re in the suburbs!"

Their fish tank has so much green moss in it, you can barely see the fish inside. I ordered Orange chicken and what I received was a joke for a 9 dollar lunch special. The chicken was soggy and tasteless and the rice was awful. They give you crab ragoon I think it was, which I don&#39;t eat anyways. I was also not greeted in any way shape or form. I walked up and they just stared at me. I said, I am picking up a to go order and the guy just threw the bag my way and rang me out. I said thank you and nothing.

The food here was alright, nothing too greasy. I enjoyed the fact that the staff spoke Cantonese and answer our questions (our table had a few strict vegetarians who can not touch dishes that are tainted with meat or garlic). 

Since we were a fairly large party the smoothies we ordered came out slowly. Most of the food arrived before the drinks came. 

Something notable about this restaurant is interesting photos in the men&#39;s room (my sibling told me...). 

The portions seemed generous. The sauces that came with the potstickers were really good to eat with white rice. I might give another go at this place in the future."

Other examples we ordered pepper beef, and the the meet was cheap cuts of sirloin vs it was tenderloin in the past.  Also ordered our usual orange pork, and it used to be from the prime cuts, but not now, they were tough chewy little bits of pork.

That&#39;s a huge deal for me since I tend to be suspicious of blandly named restaurants and their signage. I&#39;m weird. It&#39;s the designer in me.

The inside is nice. There are big, pretty fish in tanks when you walk in, but you&#39;re usually seated rather quickly. The decor is pretty great and maybe even beautiful; especially when considering the outside of the establishment, and worse, it&#39;s surroundings which are dingy.

The food here is pretty damn incredible. The shrimp fried rice is awesome, sweet and sour chicken was hot, crunchy and juicy, ect. I mean, it&#39;s really not that unique, but the specials for dine-in are great because you get a choice of soup and so many entrees. Really, you&#39;ll eventually hit a point where you cannot stuff your fat gullet any longer and you&#39;re still just swimming in food, scratch swimming...drowning in food.

HOWEVER if you have time for dinner and want to have some fun, ask your waiter if what you can get that isn&#39;t on the menu?  If you watch most of the chinese families end up with things that arn&#39;t the menu.

When I inquired our waiter smiled and said &#34; you have to ask me for that stuff&#34;     So I did, and he just brings out some great stuff and you eat it. Didn&#39;t know what some of it was, ( so I could order next time ) but All of it was great!!"

This used to be our favorite Chinese restaurant.  Their dishes were always plentiful, their crab rangoon was great and they had the best egg rolls ever.   The last few times we went there, the food portions have shrunk, the prices went up and the quality of the food is not what it once was.  I understand that prices will rise, that&#39;s a fact of life.   But if you&#39;re going to raise prices, at least keep the quality consistent.  Don&#39;t slack off on the quality and then raise your prices.  I am happy to pay more for food that is worth paying for but when you try to sneak one by us like that, it&#39;s almost insulting."

They will inflate the number of your drinks.  I had a party for 30 people this past weekend and my tab was inflated by 5 drinks which should only be 15 drinks.  I know for sure because we are families and very close friends and there were only a handful drinkers.  When I got home and looked at the tab, there was no way we&#39;ve had that many drinks.  I checked with everyone and was confirmed that they over charged me 5 drinks worth about $25.  Since we&#39;ve been their regular customers for years and know each other by names, I called to explain that we couldn&#39;t have had that many drinks.  They insisted that it was correct because the tab was tallied by their servers and there was nothing they could do now.  I explain to them that we all knew who had what drinks and what the 5 extra drinks were.   They finally agreed to meet me half way by offering a free entree next time I visit.   As a regular customer who just spent over $1,000 on this restaurant,  I feel cheated and don&#39;t think we would ever go back there again.

The Kung Pao had chunks of zucchini in it which actually complemented the dish well.  I would have preferred more spice to the dish but overall, the taste was good.

I have heard several of my cousins in Europe talk about this infamous Peri Peri..so I finally made the trip with my sister for her birthday!

Environment - Very casual, family oriented joint. Contemporary feel, nice lighting and good for a small crowd! It was a nice way to unwind on a Friday night!

Food - Coming from a traditional Pakistani household, when you go out to eat Pakistani food, it is always too much..and too much food isn&#39;t always the best thing. The wonderful thing about Peri Peri (which will keep me coming back) is the right portion of food. Perfect for 1 or 2 people. We ordered the Chicken and Rice bowl, leg and thigh piece, chicken tenders, and Peri Cassava Fries! There is also an island for garlic and sriracha sauce, plates, silverware, and napkins. Everything was fresh and delicious! 

However, having said all the positive attributes to this awesome joint. I will say, for someone who has never dined at Peri Peri- the rule is to pick your table first followed by ordering your food. But the line for a clean table took a while..a bit confusing and chaotic to go out with children. But with the quality of the chicken, it was all worth the wait! I will definitely be returning!"

You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. 3 stars for the fact that we waited a good 15 minutes before someone cleaned the table of the previous guests plates and garbage. But the absolutely delicious chicken makes it worthy of an additional star.

Let&#39;s talk about the food. Wow!! I tried the wings in the following flavors: mild, hot, and extra hot. Every single level of heat was delicious, I prefer hot. There is definitely something addictive about these wings. Whatever sauces they use on the chicken as it is grilled complement the smokiness of the grilled meat perfectly. These are my new favorite wings!

I also tried the rice, perinaise corn, and fries. Nothing mind blowing..  but then again, they are probably seasoned/flavored to help with the heat of the chicken. I also really liked whatever that white sauce was in the bottle at the condiment station. 

Btw, if you&#39;re a fan of carrot cake, I definitely recommend there Carrot Filler Cake. The cream cheese is on the inside.  It was so flavorful and moist.

My friends have a high spice tolerance and were close to dying on the &#34;Hot&#34; level - can&#39;t imagine if they did the &#34;Very Hot&#34;. Now I&#39;m a weaksauce so I went with the lemon &amp; herbs flavoring which was suprisingly spicy for me! My nose was sweating on the sides and I felt the moistness building under my eyes, as well! Ugh! 

I had the 4 piece chicken tenders for $5.55. It&#39;s a healthy meal for sure because it&#39;s all protein! Honestly I think I will get the plain tenders if I go again because the lemon &amp; herbs was too hot for my weak self. I&#39;m not entirely sure 4 small strips are worth the $5.55 price tag though...I think it&#39;s a bit exorbitant. Proper pricing would be $1 a strip based on the size, location, etc and even that is pushing it.

I added on the Perinaise corn and it comes in a good sized portion for $2.25. Tasty with a bit of a kick to it, creamy &amp; delicious. No complaints on the pricing or flavor of this side dish!

We also tried the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cream Pie because if you see that on a menu, how can you then pass it up!? Loved this. It&#39;s not your traditional pie at all as it came in a to go container and was more layers of ingredients than actual pie. $2.99 and I&#39;d probably get this again as it was rich and such an indulgent dessert.

Food is good, prices are slightly elevated for Schaumburg demographic but overall a place I&#39;d dine at again."

Remember each spiciness is one level up from what you may expect. 

Chicken and Rice bowl - decent, the chicken is done with great tenderness again. This time they are tenderloins. We&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the rice is a garlic sauce delivery system so that&#39;s good. 

Reminder: the Garlic Sauce (free) is the best thing they make here!!!!!

Grilled Corn on the Cob is pretty decent, note: you can get sauce on it, it makes it wonderful, but super spicy. The corn is sooo soft and super sweet. 

Cassava Fries : Um chunks of some root fried, it was dense and not crispy per say, I drenched them in garlic sauce.

Cole Slaw: I think they got it premade somewhere, boring....

Watch your bill, my friend ordered the 2 quarter chicken meal and they charged him for 2 of the 1/4 chicken meals which cost about 2 dollars more after tax.  Not cool. They did fix it though, maybe the guy that did it wrong was new?

I will definitely say that my impression was better than my counterparts. I loved the chicken. I got the medium tenders and the hot wings along with a side of rice. The rice was okay but when I put the garlic sauce on it, it really popped in flavor. I can&#39;t tell you if that is how it is supposed to be eaten but it was delicious that way. 
The medium is pretty spicy. I would easily compare it to other restaurant&#39;s hot but it was fabulous. It was full of flavor and I promise that I felt like there was some smoke in the flavor. I loved it. 
The hot was really hot, like REALLY hot! I didn&#39;t expect it to be that hot but I couldn&#39;t stop eating it either. I was trapped by the flavor. 
I love the fact that it is cooked fresh to order. The building smelled great. I would have liked a little more crispness to my tenders. They were juicy though so I won&#39;t complain.

The food is along the lines of Middle Eastern, but centered on the Peri Peri spice aka the African birds eye pepper. So the cashier was not helpful explaining the menu, so here&#39;s my interpretation...all the foods, especially the chicken give a nod to this pepper. The chicken is marinated in it, at various heat levels, the sides are seasoned with it and the peri salt can be added to many items. Often times the Peri sauce is not like ketchup or BBQ, it&#39;s a marinade, not something you can get in the side. 
Now for our order, remind you, the cashier was not helpful, not annoyed at us, just simply not able to really explain their system or recommend popular dishes, so we did our best. I got the falafel pita, I love falafel. The pita was not great, dry, but the falafel and veggies were really fresh and the garlic sauce was awesome. This is a traditional sauce that they have bottles of you can bring to your table, YUM!!! I also got the Cassava Fries with Peri salt. These are coin shaped cassava root slices, they are very think! I would try the other sides before I got this again, the salt was helpful, but I just did not love them. My mom ordered the Paneer cheese small bite. It was fine, but we said we probably would do something else next time. We were thinking more along the lines of saganaki, but this is not merely at all, although it has good flavor. She also got the Peri Chicken pita mild flavor and the chicken was juicy and tender. The heat level is sneaky, it comes after you swallow, so mild was a good choice for her. We liked our food. 
The last thing I&#39;ll mention is what others have suggested...The service. It&#39;s really not good. The cashiers were confused. One was cooking too. The food comes out really slowly. It&#39;s kind of annoying to wait that long. 
I will go back because I like the flavors, but I&#39;m hoping management gets some more help in there to speed up the process...and maybe find a new pita vendor."

The ambiance is clean, a lil smoky, and seemingly your clothes may smell afterwards, but its all good - cuz the flavors here are worth it. 

I got the sandwhich/ciabatta - with a side of the cassava fries. For the chicken, there are many heat levels here to choose from, I ordered the orignal heat level - forgot what it was actually called - but it was pretty damn hot - but happy to report that I didn&#39;t regret it in the morning.

First time coming to this restaurant with my friend. We decided to order many items off the menu to try a little bit of everything but boy did I we regret it!

Prior to ordering, we were the only customers in the restaurant, we were not greeted so we just decided to sit down at the nearest table. Everything was super sticky - the menu, the table, and the floors. 

I ordered falafels as an appetizer and &#34;the wrap&#34; with fries and steamed veggies. My friend ordered &#34;the burger&#34; with cheese and as a side she ordered perinase corn. Together our meal came to $40. 

Food was subpar and for what I&#39;m paying for, I&#39;m expecting a decent meal. Literally 2 small chicken tenders in each sandwich. The steamed veggies were a joke, still cold and had freeze burn taste. The burger was suppose to have melted cheese but it was just slapped on. My appetizer came to our table last and had a weird after taste.

I really like how they allow you to add a flavor or spice level to the falafel itself (lemon &amp; herb all the way to spicy). 

I have gone back to get the falafel sandwiches! I wish they offered a vegetarian platter like they do with the meats, especially for when we go as a family. It&#39;s a very convenient location and one of the better falafel places that is close by schaumburg. The garlic sauce is great and I douse it onto my food, however you will have a longstanding garlic after taste in your mouth! The red hot sauce is extremely spicy! BEWARE!!

I&#39;ve been here twice now, and will continue to do so. Their chicken are moist and filled with mouthwatering flavor. The sauces that I recommend is the garlic, lemon, and medium spice. Not only is their chicken savory, but their side dishes are very good. Their corn, slaw, and fries are so good! Not to mention their garlic sauce, that is a must, which I recommend you have that next to you at all times with every bite."

Nando&#39;s style place right here in Roselle and I didn&#39;t know!!?? This is a great spot hidden on Roselle road by another favorite of mine Bisi Nigerian restaurant (shameless promo) The fame of a Nando&#39;s style place is the long and unique marination of chicken and then the adorning sauces to follow. There were two sauces out at Portos and both were awesome. I wanted to steal a bottle of each and drink it. You get to choose your chicken or platter of chicken and heat level plus sides. We had the fries with perinaise salt. Over all awesome chicken and sauces you think about in the office in the afternoon.This will sound like a negative but I mean this is the most positive way----my mouth was on fire till we got home and I kept thinking why did I keep eating so much sauce---yet I wanted more. Idea--sell bottles of the stuff. Please.
Reduced one star because of the chaotic dining area. I wasnt sure to be seated then order or order at counter then be seated. It was crowded and a little crazy. Looked a bit disorganized and dark. Otherwise plenty of parking, staff was nice but looked exhausted at 7 pm on a Saturday evening. Can be healthy if you stick to the salads and chicken. 
Note: Don&#39;t say the word &#34;Nando&#34; in Porto&#39;s"

  We ordered the original platter with grilled corn on the cob and fries. You get two chicken quarters and two breasts with wing. For chicken and fries it does seem expensive but its so unique to the palette that one&#39;s splurge feels justified.   Darn you, peri peri pepper, for you are a painful addiction.  I never understood how the combo of fries with this peri peri chicken worked until I actually tried it.  The fries are a great way to neutralize the heat and try to regroup. I  closed my eyes when taking bites to spare my eyeballs from the lava-like splatter. Jokes aside, it is delicious and I&#39;ll be back.  My kid and I mixed the white garlic sauce and chili sauce together, creating sauce from heaven.  I haven&#39;t tried Nando&#39;s yet but I do have a bottle of their sauce.  We didn&#39;t want our corn on the cob sauced, but they did it anyway and eating it was like throwing gasoline into a bonfire..but we finished the corn too.  If you decide not to use silverware and go all in, please be careful and definitely wash your hands well afterwards.  I&#39;ll be back to try other menu items for sure."

Let me preface by saying that the chicken here is delicious. It&#39;s juicy and the marinade is so tasty. However, service was severely lacking. With plates and garbage still atop the tables, I thought they would be cleaned within a few minutes. It took the staff however closer to 30 minutes to clean them off. Fortunately, our group was able to locate a clean table in the corner. 

Additionally, it took 35-40 minutes for our food to come out. I&#39;ve typically experienced waits closer to 15-20 minutes here, so we were really disappointed with the longer wait time.  Our group consisted of 4 people (we ordered one of the family platters). I would have appreciated it if I had been given a heads up about our wait at the time I placed the order. That way I could have decided to stay or leave. 

I&#39;m hoping we visited them on an off-night, but it was clear that they were understaffed and the timing from the kitchen was off. I&#39;m hoping they make these improvements which would make this a great restaurant."

We ended up going home to make mac and cheese.  

Our glasses were not cleaned. We had to exchange them, and the new ones we got were dirty too.  Tables appearance were deteriorating and sticky. And straws were all soggy wet.  Restrooms were not clean. 

The House Salad with Chicken was small and not filling. Overpriced for what it was. And the olives were not fresh.

The half chicken with hot sauce was the tastiest of all three orders.  Sides are not included and overpriced for the small portions.

The location looks like it was nice when it first opened but they have not done a good job with basic up keep.

It is more Indian and Middle Eastern than Portuguese. 

Overall, not a value for the money. The staff is not welcoming and definitely not  knowledgeable service. Not every item in the menu is tasty (hit or miss). The atmosphere is casual (families and groups of friends). Not returning any time soon."

The problem is that the background noise was so overwhelming that neither of us could really hear the other.  I pointed this out more than once, but nothing could be done for it.  Consequently, they messed up my order.  I asked for a veggie pita because I am trying to avoid eating chicken - making Peri Peri an odd choice for dinner, I know.  Over all the ruckus he asks to confirm &#34;You want a pita?&#34;  I confirm that I do, as well as kasava fries.  I wound up getting the kasava fries and a *chicken* pita.

This place caterers to everyone.. vegetarian or not, mild or spicy. 

I am a big fan of Porto&#39;s Peri Peri in Skokie (formerly Fogo&#39;s Peri Peri), so I was ecstatic when it opened up in Schaumburg. 

This place is similar to Nando&#39;s, but in my opinion, much much better.

I highly recommend the Peri Cassava Fries with the Perinaise.. it&#39;ll blow your mind.

This location is great for dinning in. You definitely do not feel like you&#39;re at a fast casual place when you&#39;re there.

Lastly, if you get something that has perinaise in it (i.e. veg burger), up your spice level one notch. For example, if you can usually handle medium spicy, I would turn it up to hot as the perinaise helps offset the spiciness."

Second - I also ordered wings which I asked the cashier whether they were full wings or not (drum and flats). She said yes. What I got were the tiniest chicken pieces I&#39;ve ever seen. I could not believe my eyes... Definitely not worth 6 bucks for 6 teeny pieces. Third - Food quality is average at best.  The rice, the corn, the chicken were just ok.

Although it would have been a better deal to order the whole chicken with 2 large sides, we really wanted some salad with our meal and that isn&#39;t a side option. So we order a small order of fries (nice with the peri spice sprinkled on top and then dipped in garlic sauce), a small yellow rice (didn&#39;t like this too much - tastes like a weak Indian biriyani) and two house salads (really nice if you like olives) - we could have ordered one for the three of us but was advised to order two.  

Pricey for what you get so we wouldn&#39;t go often but the chicken is a winner!  We ordered over the phone (a bit annoying that their webpage doesn&#39;t have prices so I had to ask the price of everything to decide  the chicken orders - 1/4, 2 leg, whole etc) so the order was ready shortly after we arrived.

There classic chicken and rice &#34;Medium&#34; is my favorite. I would say the 1/4 is sufficient for a meal and is always perfectly cooked and taste great regardless of how spicy. Their Garlic sauce is amazing and best part is there is no extra charge. They have garlic sauce bottles like bottle of ketchup for each table and it is very tasty. The sauce has the perfect texture and flavor, isn&#39;t too strong, but just enough to make it great.

If you want a quick dessert, they have some fairly decent options. Nothing too fancy and its about the size of your palm, but its just enough.


The only reason I was unable to give it 5 stars is because the process is quite slow and waiting for your food after you order can exceed 25 min in some cases. This might just be the nature of the restaurant and getting fresh food, but If you go when its slow you can get your food fairly quickly."

I&#39;m into the Portuguese chicken type dishes with the different sauces.
Okay, so we went and this place was poppin. There were lines and tables were taken. We had 2 separate tables, but after 20 mins ended up sitting together. 
We placed an order and they said it was going to be a wait of 1hr +. We were all (7 people and 2 kids)  starving, so decided to wait and order appetizers. 
Okay, so after placing orders we got our cool mason jar glasses to get our drinks. Self-serve fountain drinks. I loved the mason jar glasses :-), fun drinking in them. 
We waited and waited and still no sign of food or appetizers. About an hour or more we got our 1st platter. This was weird because we didn&#39;t even get our appetizers. They apologized and said it would be coming out shortly. 
Finally, all of our food came 30 mins later. If you decide to go be prepared for a long wait.
Chicken wings were really good, and the platters of chicken we ordered were really good. Had different Sauces from lemon herb to hott. Becareful because they run spicy. The white garlic mayo sauce was amazing.  The corn and red potatoe salad was scrumptious. The peri peri rice was bad, only thing i didn&#39;t like. Ive had peri peri rice and this wasn&#39;t it. This tasted like regular boiled rice. The food is zabiha halal, so that&#39;s always good. 
Overall, good food. Long long long long service.  They need more staff. 
I&#39;ll try this place again, but not right away.

I go here often and the staff is amazing, very nice people and they make sure you are satisfied at the end of the day.  The only issue is the inconsistency of when the food is ready.  Sometimes I get my food within 10-15 minutes and sometimes I end up waiting 45 minutes to an hour.  The staff is young but I think they&#39;ll get the hang of it soon.  Amazing food Amazing people.

The uniqueness of the cuisine is what drew me in. We wanted to try a little of everything so we got the whole chicken w/lemon &amp; spice, which was cut up into 4 easy to eat pieces. For sides,  I ordered the rice, mixed olives, falafel w/mild sauce and french fries. I ordered pita bread but they were out so they suggested another side and I chose the perinaise corn. Oh my gosh, soooo good. It&#39;s like Mexican elotes without the chili powder or cheese. The mixed olives were perfectly salty with a nice marinade. The falafel w/ mild sauce were decent as was the rice. The most forgettable item was the fries: soggy and cold, but those aren&#39;t a specialty of this place and I don&#39;t recommend them. Oh, and they have a nice selection of desserts. I got the carrot cake, which was phenomenal (and no raisins - yay!).  Oh oh and they give you this awesome garlicky ranch sauce and a nice hot sauce, both were great. 

So, basically try everything above except for the fries, they were the only disappointment (and the no pita). I waited about 20 minutes, but this isn&#39;t fast food, they&#39;re preparing fresh hot food that&#39;s worth a little wait."

Went there yesterday, ordered the &#34;1/4 chicken: leg and thigh&#34;. I got one leg. It was explained to me that they are in the process of fixing the menu to say &#39;leg or thigh&#39;.

$7+ for one piece of chicken (no sides or drink)?

The cashier informed my group of 4 of this so we just settled for sizzler sandwiches. 

3 of the 4 sandwiches came, we waited for the last one and it never came. They didn&#39;t give a reason why it never came but they slapped a sandwich together after 30 minutes and served it. When we did get the sandwiches it literally had 2 scraps of chicken tender meat. Literally scraps, not even whole pieces. The side portion was an even bigger joke. I complained right then to the waiter and all he said was &#34;oh.&#34;

The line grew longer and longer, and since my table was directly in front of the ordering counter I could hear them tell patrons that they are no longer taking orders. The line was to the door and instead of announcing it to them at once, people waited several minutes in line only to hear &#34;sorry&#34; once they got to the counter- why even let people in??

I understand things happen and I&#39;m sure they had no chicken, but on days like this the manager should be in the restaurant to handle the situation. The employees did not look trained enough to handle a full house and were working quite flustered. The Chicago area has tons of Zabiha meat stores, for this one night they could have drove over to one and picked up some meat. 

True customer service would mean for management to go table by table, apologize for the inconvenience, and give a voucher for next time. That voucher would at least give some incentive to come back, but not worth the drive again in my books."

My family and friends went here on Sunday 5-6-16. Ordered and paid $62 and then the wait began. After an hour and fifteen minutes and to families that ordered after us got their food we asked about our order and the incompetent staff looking lost and confused didn&#39;t even start on the order. The manager on duty saw us all sitting in front of the ordering desk waiting and he didn&#39;t even enquire if we were waiting for our food. Lack customer service skills. When I cancelled the order he look relived and happy because without hesitation he refunded the money. No apologies or an attempt to retain us as customers. Instead his excuse was that he is understaffed. When we ordered there were 2 families and a couple there. I believe there were 3 to 4 working including the manager. Just a word of advice to the owner(s) your business will suffer if you are depending on improperly trained staff. I speak as a business owner myself. Came in hungry we left starving from your restaurant. Instead had to go to Pita Inn and got food served in 15 to 20 minutes from ordering.

First, there wasnt a clean table to be found.  Each table we chose had food, crumbs and a sticky substance on it.  I finally went and got some napkins and wiped a table off myself.  I also noticed the chairs needed wiping off before I sat down. Word of warning....the floor is slippery if you are not wearing tennis shoes, you can easily fall here.  I&#39;m surprised nobody has fallen and sued them yet. Once seated, I took a menu to place my order and was appalled at the greasy, sticky feeling on my hands after touching the menu.  I ordered the chicken and rice bowl and chose the lemon herb seasoning.  The chicken was grilled to perfection but did not taste like lemon herb at all.  The rice was good and had a little kick to it.  The serving size was more than enough for me and i even took a small portion home.  The drink choices are your regular run of the mill soda drinks (Coke Products) or tea.  Overall the food was mediocre. The ambiance was less than accetable with the slippery floor, dark and loud dining area and strip mall location.  I unfortunately would not rerurn to this establishment."

My family and I ordered the House Special Cantonese Style Fried Noodles, Coconut Shrimp, and Chicken with Vegetables. I was a bit disappointed with the fried noodles because it wasn&#39;t very crispy like authentic Cantonese Fried Noodles. However, it wasn&#39;t bad by any means. I would definitely skip over the coconut shrimp because it was around 21 dollars and the portion was small and the shrimp were the small kind. The coconut sauce was also cold. The chicken and vegetables are your standard and it&#39;s with a clear sauce, one of the healthier options here.

Just because it had two orange slices in the box, I guess that makes it Orange Beef. The egg foo yong had a gelletinous light brown gravy that once cooled, you could never heat it up enough to be gravy again.

Catherine, five stars are reserved for places that we can hardly wait to go back to and bring our friends. I think you were very confused, woman!  To each his/her own I guess...

Anyhow, I was in the area and suggested Heng Wing for lunch last weekend. We went in and I felt like I had just hopped out of my delorean with Marty McFly because this was definitely a blast from the past!  The decor is horribly dated, but I can totally see past that in most cases. Often, it actually can add to the charm. 

We were promptly seated and then we waited. A long while. While sitting in the middle of a restaurant packed with mainly senior citizens, I started to think that I might qualify for AARP before we meet a server. Thankfully this was the not case and we did get an apology when they realized that the table of youngins hadn&#39;t been waited on yet. 

We ordered egg rolls, crab Rangoon, Mongolian beef, sesame chicken and orange chicken. Nothing even remotely interesting because there was nothing available on the menu. The only special requests were chicken breast only and extra spicy orange chicken (it was marked as a spicy dish already, but my hubby wanted to turn it up).  

Here&#39;s my take (that is why you&#39;re reading this review, right?):
Egg Rolls - I would stop by again to get these egg rolls for take out. Crispy on the outside and loaded with identifiable deliciousness inside. These were very good. 

Crab Rangoon - Way too much cream cheese for my liking. One of my dining partners likes that though, so he happily took those leftovers home. 

Mongolian beef - I didn&#39;t taste it. It looked very good and I was told that the beef was a good quality and not fatty. 

Sesame chicken - Not breaded. Very bland. Excellent quality chicken. Too much sauce. I did not enjoy it and didn&#39;t bother with my leftovers. Side note...the portions were huge. But, it didn&#39;t really matter if the food wasn&#39;t tasty. 

Orange chicken - I did taste this. In order to get extra spicy, they added paprika. This was weird. I wouldn&#39;t have even imagined paprika in their kitchen. My husband ate some, but he skipped his leftovers too. If the paprika wouldn&#39;t have been added, it would have tasted liked my sesame chicken. Bland. 

So, they roll around these large metal carts to bring food out. Remember the clunky metal cart that the room moms used to bring our weekly fluoride rinse out on at school?  Yeah, it was a cart like that. On more than one occasion, we saw our food leave the kitchen, but because they seem to only &#39;drive&#39; the carts clockwise, the food would travel around the whole dining room making other stops before it made it to us. I imagine this saves on spilling on the old carpet, but I was not a fan. Too weird. All of it. The server was nice enough. I just don&#39;t see us going back other than to maybe grab an egg roll for the road."

As always, the egg rolls were good and main course was good.....however, the place was a mess.  There were numerous tables that had not been bussed and there was debris all over the floor.....very disturbing and not an environment that is conducive when a restaurant wants to appear clean and neat.

I think I could have used it as glue for a science project.  Then the meat was old and the tempura had no taste.  Finally the rice....Uncle Bens would have been better.

Table, seats, condiment dispensers, and silverware were filthy, and our waiter was rude. Water came in extremely small glass, as well as the tea, which cost 3 dollars per tiny pot. Both beverages were disgusting. Plates were very small. Chicken and beef skewers were almost burnt, and way over cooked, and gross. The prices were way too high for this terrible quality. The bathrooms were dirty. When our food came, it was extremely cold, when supposed to be hot, and a tiny portion. The breading was doughy, and very bad tasting. Sweet and sour sauce was anything but, and thick, foul taste, and cold. This was an entirely terrible experience. Very overrated. I reccomend you not going here, and stick to the nearby Fortune Kookie, which is amazing compared to this dump!"

But there is one waiter In particular who is the worst waiter on the face of the earth. He has dark black hair short and a very cold personality. On this occasion  to the establishment he demaned his tip at the end of the service even though he was rude and impolite.Also during this lunch visit he was more focused on eating his own food then taking care of us his customers. Then when he finished his meal he asks us if we needed anything 3 times in row even though we said we are good the first time. Then he says I can pay him and at the end of the service he says I can pay at the front. So if you want bad service have this unfriendly waiter.

This is the first time I&#39;ve been here so I ordered standard fare. Egg rolls, beef fried rice and plain Jane beef chow mien. Basic items that only a bad Chinese restaurant can screw up. All was good. Actually the egg rolls and rice were better than most places I&#39;ve been too. 

Parking is terrible, and they need smaller portion options. But other than that, a good solid recommendation."

Pork Fried Rice had really good flavor with huge chunks of tender pork.  Crab Rangoon was our favorite. They were rich and very tasty.  We didn&#39;t like the Sweet n Sour chicken because it was way too sweet. Kung Pow chicken wasn&#39;t very spicy but had fresh veggies and good taste.  And the Egg Rolls, which are always my deal breaker, were really good. 
We can&#39;t speak for the service but the 1 star reviews seem a bit harsh.  The food was enjoyable and we&#39;ll definitely be ordering again."

We&#39;re always looking for good &#34;bumpy&#34; egg rolls and this place has the best. Also love the egg foo yung, cantonese chicken and sesame chicken (not heavily coated, dark, super sweet and deep fried like other places -- all white meal, very lightly coated, slightly spicy).

And Mary&#39;s special Mai Tai will kick you @ss! It&#39;s fantastic. 

But we always seem to get a particular server who is unbelievably rude. His answers to requests and one word, if at all, and his overall attitude is always as if we were the dumbest people he&#39;d ever encountered. We go back despite this, but it would be 5 stars if not for the service."

Decided to stop here for lunch when I saw a couple of open spaces to see what seems to bring so many customers in to the place. 

At a glance when walking in, the place looks kind of nice, albeit a little dated. But as I looked a little closer, it was clear that it could use a good cleaning - the booth for two that I was seated at had some stuff on it that may have been there for awhile. The carpet was pretty dirty - they&#39;re lucky it&#39;s a dark carpet - could be worse. The &#34;mini-pitchers&#34; with the sweet and sour / mustard came out with dribble on the front that just didn&#39;t look good. And the carts for bringing out food and picking up dishes are seldom used anymore simply because utilities such as those and visible bus tubs aren&#39;t really acceptable in restaurants anymore.

As for the food - the eggrolls were pretty good; $3.50 for 2, maybe a little pricey - but they were big so that accounted for the cost. The Mongolian Beef I ordered was OK - I have had better and worse. It was made and served as Mongolian Beef should be, but was blander than what I was expecting.

As for returning - maybe - but no real compelling reason to do so."

Do you like apples? ....I mean egg rolls!! Do you like egg rolls? They make one of  the best egg rolls I have ever had. They are up there with New Star. 

We did the dinner for two this past weekend on Friday night. They allowed us to make one substitution. Love it!! We swapped out the S&amp;S Chicken for a Sesame Chicken. 

The dinner includes a soup for each of you, egg drop or won ton, and we got one of each. It was very good, served nice and hot, just the way Chinese soup is intended to be served. It also includes an egg roll and a BBQ rib for each person. You get beef and broccoli and S&amp;S chicken as your entrees. Again, we swapped the S&amp;S Chicken out for the Sesame and both were very good. The beef and broccoli was more for the fiance, and the sesame chicken was more for me. It also came with some pork fried rice which was pretty good. 

It was a happening social environment which was surprising for a Chinese restaurant, but hey, good food and downtown Palatine, you can&#39;t be too surprised.

Over the past 2 yr&#39;s their food has become highly inconsistent.  

Recently we ordered take out, usually egg foo young and fried rice.  Both tasted very bland, I wondered if the rice did anything more than slide over the wok and out.  They are always busy and I wonder if they aren&#39;t falling into the trap so many Chinese restaurants have, which is they don&#39;t believe their customer base knows good food and will accept anything they put out there.

They need a kitchen manager that enforces quality preparation, someone who watches out for the customer interests first.

I will be reducing my visits to maybe a couple times a year and if the next dish I order is of the same poor quality I&#39;ll quit altogether going here."

Probably since I was about 10 years old. So, my review might be slight skewed with personal bias and nostalgia. Memories of being a little girl and having family dinners at Heng Wing bring me back to some happy times. Anyways, I will admit, it&#39;s not the best Chinese food around, and definitely not as good as it was when I was a kid, but there&#39;s something about it that has had me eating there for the last 15 - 20 years. 

Heng Wing offers your standard Cantonese fare...Egg Foo Young, Cantonese Chow Mein, Chop Suey...you get the idea. There&#39;s nothing fancy here. Heng Wing is not your standard Chinese food with modern or contemporary twists. It&#39;s straight up, old fashioned Chinese goodness. You know, the stuff laced with sodium ((and probably MSG)). But hey, it&#39;s damn good and once in a while won&#39;t kill you.  

Whether you dine in or carry-out, I&#39;ve always found the food to be piping hot and fresh. I prefer the option of carry-out, only because you have the option of a small or large portion. Dining in only offers one size ((and one high price)), and each dish is enough to feed 4 people. The fried wontons with their sweet and sour sauces is hands down one of my favorites. The dough is fried perfectly and crispy on the outside, and gooey and chewy on the inside. ((My inner fat kid prefers to eat only an order of those, but my hips, ass, and blood sugar levels won&#39;t have it)) 

Some goodies &amp; faves:
+ Fried Won Ton
+ Sesame Chicken
+ Peapods with Beef
+ Sweet &amp; Sour chicken
+ Crispy &amp; Light Veggies
+ Vegetable Egg Foo Young

Service is often fairly terrible. It&#39;s been an ongoing trend for as long as I can remember. The servers typically aren&#39;t that friendly, and not that attentive. But hey, I go for the food ((and nostalgia)). The same could be said about the decor and ambiance. It&#39;s definitely way outdated and probably should enlist some help from an interior designer...but again, I go for the food. 

Overall opinion: I still love it. Biased or not. For healthier and tastier Chinese food, I know of several other places...but once in a while I come back to my childhood love, my tried and true, Heng Wing."

Flavorless sauces.

Grimy dining room.

I used to go here when I was a kid (grew up in Palatine) but have been here 3 times in last year (because my family and I like to give places a second - and obviously third - chance) and I was utterly grossed out by most of their offerings.

Take it from me (and my whole family), Heng Wing has gone downhill.  It&#39;s not worth anyone&#39;s money and NO ONE CAN JUSTIFY using canned mushrooms in what is marketed as fresh Chinese/Cantonese cuisine.  

That&#39;s just terrible."

If you go to Heng Weng, do not forget to order these- especially with their orange sauce to dip in, mmmmm. As far as the rest of the food goes, it&#39;s your typical chinese food but with a little more grease, and that&#39;s kinda what makes it so good.

The service was a little rushed &amp; we were a semi large group (12) The waiter kept asking if we were done. Added check when I was still trying to get coffee. Almost any restaurant gets a star just for keeping my coffee cup full. Usually order it after 1 drink &amp; by time food comes- never wait til after dinner. Usually tell waiter I love my coffee. Then it&#39;s up to them to keep full. So anyway he comes back &amp; says they&#39;re out of coffee! What restaurant runs out of coffee? &amp; if you do &amp; we are semi regulars not that they give any acknowledgement . So lots of repeat business &amp; don&#39;t think ever under 10 people. So went to check with manager. She&#39;s behind the bar - talking to people. The host tried saying he&#39;s seen full pots before so he knows they usually have it, all this time I&#39;m trying to get managers eye &amp; can tell they were intimidated to goto her. I would have had to excuse myself &amp; get through like 5 people to reach her- she was avoiding me- I&#39;m asking well do we ca ahead next time ?

Food was OK but the portions were small. After eating our entrees we were expecting the normal fortune cookie or almond cookie. We got neither. C&#39;mon even fast food Chinese places give you a fortune cookie. $40 for an appetizer and 2 entrees that were just OK? We&#39;ll look elsewhere.

The staff is super friendly. They are always pleasant and smiling! They seem to know a lot of their customers, which makes me believe that there are a lot of &#39;Regulars&#39; that eat here.

The food is also great! The egg rolls are always fresh and also pretty generous in size! Their soups are also good and I am yet to try an entree I didn&#39;t like! My favorites include the Sweet and Sour Chicken, The Coconut Shrimp and the Beef and Broccoli!

They also have some pretty good drinks as well!

Last night I was on my own, and decided to try Heng Wing, an old favorite.  I snagged the only parking space left in the parking lot. The parking lot is still too small, and there are now notices taped to the door warning diners not to park in certain parking lots. Upon entering there were several people behind a counter, and one of them looked at me standing there alone and assumed I was there for pick-up.  &#34;Pick-up?&#34; was the only greeting.  I told him no, and asked if one person could dine alone.  He pointed to the other end of the counter and said the hostess was over there.  I stood in the foyer waiting to be recognized by the hostess and be seated.  The hostess was having a conversation with a third person behind the counter about a personal issue,  That conversation lasted several minutes, and she never acknowledged my presence. A couple who emerged from dining room ready to pay their check, and the hostess attended to them.  The person she was conversing with then turned to me and said &#34;Are you all set?&#34;, in a manor that seemed to indicate that: Had I finished dining and was I ready to pay my check.

Years ago I heard about this place and heard it was good, so we gave it a try because Yu&#39;s in Schaumburg was over an hour wait. We got right in with no problem and I know why now. The hostess was nice, but sat us way in the back corner. Thought it was kind of strange seeing as there were plenty of table in the front of the dinning room. Our server was not so great, she had the personality of a board. She pressed us to place an appitizer order and then once we did, we decided we wanted the dinner for two and she was mad because she was suppose to bring the soup before our egg rolls. This didn&#39;t bother us, but it pissed her off and she made that clear. 
The inside of this place needs some serious cleaning, it is so dirty and run down. The carpet hasn&#39;t been clean in at least 20 years, the servers all push around these noisy dirty carts. This whole cart thing was so annoying and nasty. They bring your food out on them, the wheel boxes and bags over to your table to wrap up your food. It was just gross, the clean off tables with them and then bring your food out on them. 
As I said before we got the dinner for two, the egg rolls were good the soup is hard to screw up. BUT the food was aweful. We had Sweet and Sour Chicken that had zero taste. Beef and Broccoli that tasted so DIRTY, I swear they didn&#39;t was the broccoli before then cooked it. They use canned mushrooms, for the high prices they charge they could afford to use fresh and not canned. The Pork Fried Rice also had no taste. 
My husband and I ate about two bites of each dish and just couldn&#39;t do it anymore. Our not so cheerful server came over, didn&#39;t ask if everything was ok, she just wrapped up our food, left the check and went on her marry way. One would have thought that if you noticed we both didn&#39;t touch the food on our plate and the dishes you brought our food out in were still almost full that something might have been wrong with the food. 
We payed the bill, left the nasty food she packed up for us on the table and next time will wait to get into Yu&#39;s or Chef Ping&#39;s. I highly do not recommend eating here, may have been good years ago but truly has gone down, way down over the years."

I loooove their Egg Foo Young- it comes in a savory dark gravy that is so tasty when mixed with the white rice that it comes with, the soft egg balancing with the crisp water chestnuts. The Veggie Fried Rice is fantastic, nice and soy saucy, but with a decidedly unique flavor, and the Crab Rangoon are actually handmade. 
The interior atmosphere is pretty standard, lots of kitchy decor, but still nice.
